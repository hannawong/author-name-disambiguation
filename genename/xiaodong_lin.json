The results show that periodical pulses can be obtained by adding a periodical pulsed current on the M-VCSEL. Under injection of the optical pulsed from M-VCSEL, the output power of S-VCSEL will switch periodically between two orthogonal polarizations, and the period is equal to the period of the modulated current in M-VCSEL. Through changing the modulated amplitude of current in M-VCSEL, the orthogonal polarization suppression ratio (OPSR) can be controlled easily. \u00a9 2009 Chin.Phys.Soc.",

The results show that under the joint action of positive optoelectronic feedback and optical injection from a master VCSEL (M-VCSEL), two polarization modes of a slave VCSEL (S-VCSEL) will show many dynamic states such as period one, period two, multi-period and chaos, and the evolution routes of these states are different for two polarization modes. Mapping of dynamic region as a function of feedback strength f and injection strength \u03b7 is varied with frequency detuning between M-VCSEL and S-VCSEL \u0394\u03bd (\u0394\u03bd = \u03bd m-\u03bd s, where \u03bd m and \u03bd s are the free-running frequencies of M-VCSEL and S-VCSEL, respectively). Compared with the case for zero or negative frequency detuning, the region of chaotic state is expanded significantly under positive \u0394\u03bd. For a fixed \u0394\u03bd, the influences of f and \u03b7 on the chaotic bandwidth of S-VCSEL are discussed. Through selecting proper f and \u03b7, chaotic bandwidth of S-VCSEL can be improved obviously. \u00a9 2012 Chinese Physical Society.",

Experimental results show that DFB semiconductor lasers are very sensitive to external perturbation and can exhibit periodic, chaos and other complex nonlinear dynamical characteristics when subjected to different external optical injection. There exist three regions of complex dynamics in the map. The complex dynamics is always related to the multi-periodic dynamics. When the laser exhibits complex dynamic, its spectrum is continuous spectrum, and there are several peaks in the spectrum.

        "abstract": "A scheme of optical generation of high-quality millimeter-wave based on the optically injected vertical-cavity-surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) subject to polarization-rotated optical feedback is proposed in this paper. Based on the spin-flip model (SFM), wich external disturbances taken into account, the performances of the millimeter-wave generated by this scheme are numerically investigated. The results show that under suitable operation conditions, a slave VCSEL (S-VCSEL) injected by a master VCSEL (M-VCSEL) will operate in a period-one (P1) oscillation state and the output optical intensity of S-VCSEL looks like being modulated by a microwave signal. By adjusting the injection strength \u03be i and the frequency detuning \u0394v between S-VCSEL and M-VCSEL, a millimeter-wave, whose frequency can be continuously adjusted in a large range from 30 GHz to 60 GHz, is obtained. After introducing polarizationrotated optical feedback, the linewidth of millimeter-wave can be obviously narrowed by adjusting the feedback strength \u03be i and the feedback delay time \u03c4. For a millimeter-wave with a linewidth of 5.509 MHz, generated by the optically injected VCSEL, its linewidth can be reduced to 230.2 kHz under optimum feedback parameters. The results obtained in this paper are helpful for acquiring highquality millimeter-wave used in high speed Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) system. \u00a9 2012 Chinese Physical Society.",

The experimental results show that the photonic microwave frequency can be continuously and widely tuned in a range of several ten GHz by adjusting the injection parameters. By introducing an optical feedback and properly adjusting the feedback strength, the photonic microwave linewidth is reduced by about two orders of magnitude from a range of 40-100 MHz to a range of 300-900 kHz. The influence of optical feedback length on the microwave linewidth is not obvious except that the photonic microwave frequency exhibits an periodical variation in a small range when the feedback length is finely varied in a small range. \u00a9 2012 Chinese Physical Society.",

Meantime, the influence of the intrinsic parameter variations of the laser on the synchronization quality is also considered, and the simulation reveals that this system still possesses good robustness to the parameter variations. Moreover, the influences of delay time and mutually coupling strength between the two lasers on chaos communication performance have also been discussed.

        "abstract": "The modulation response characteristics of a Fabry-Perot semiconductor laser (slave FP-LD) subjected to light injection from\n another Fabry-Perot semiconductor laser (master FP-LD) have been investigated theoretically. The results show that the modulation\n response performances of the slave FP-LD depend on the light injection strength, the central mode frequency detuning \u0394f and the mode spacing difference \u0394\u03bb between the slave FP-LD and the master FP-LD. With the increase of the light injection strength from the master FP-LD, the\n 3 dB modulation bandwidth of the slave FP-LD will be enhanced; however, if the injection strength is increased to certain\n degree, the front side of the relaxation oscillation peak will be reduced to below 3 dB, which results in the rapid decrease\n of the 3 dB modulation bandwidth. With the increase of \u0394f, for a relatively small injection strength level, the 3 dB modulation bandwidth will behave a monotonous enlargement until\n the slave FP-LD operates in a period-one state (P1). For a relatively strong optical injection level, the slave FP-LD has\n a broad injection-locked frequency detuning area. Within the injection-locked area, with the increase of frequency detuning\n \u0394f, the 3dB modulation bandwidth increases at first and then decreases after experiencing a maximum value. For given light injection\n strength and frequency detuning, the 3 dB modulation bandwidth of the slave FP-LD has two maximums and behaves a symmetrical\n distribution with the change of \u0394\u03bb. By choosing reasonable parameters, the 3 dB modulation bandwidth can be significantly improved. For the parameter values\n selected in this paper, the 3 dB modulation bandwidth can increase 5.5 times compared with the case of free running.",

It has been proved that in the proximity of the central frequency \u03c9 0 of a quarter-wave mirror, contributions of an individual layer to the reflection delay time and absorption-induced reflectivity reduction can be quantitatively specified with a single weighting factor pertinent to that layer. Derivations have indicated that the absorption-induced reductions of mirror reflectivity and reflection delay can be reduced by selecting an odd layer number and a large index ratio between alternating high and low refractive index coating materials. Calculations have also suggested that the absorbed incident light is not distributed, among the reflected and transmitting parts, according to the ratio between the reflectivity and potential transmission.",

        "abstract": "Based on the period-one (P1) dynamics of an optically injected semiconductor laser (SL), a photonic scheme enabling the generation of a tunable high-quality frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) signal is investigated experimentally. Under a modulated optical injection, the laser is driven into P1 oscillation with a modulated microwave frequency. In this work, optical feedback is also introduced to further reduce the microwave phase noise. The experimental results show that the central frequency of the generated FMCW signal can be widely tuned from 11.41 to 50.05 GHz by simply adjusting injection parameters while the frequency sweep range of the FMCW signal can be controlled by varying the modulation index. Under proper operating parameters, the sweep range and rate of the FMCW signal are 18.42 GHz (13.73 GHz- 32.15 GHz) and 1.14 GHz/ns, respectively. Further, by introducing an optical feedback loop, the frequency comb contrast of the FMCW signal is drastically increased by 27.15 dB when the reciprocal of the feedback delay time matches with the modulation frequency exactly due to the locking effect of the external cavity optical modes.",

We analyze the influences of injection parameters on bandwidth, complexity, and the correlation of two-channel chaotic signals. By using the two chaotic signal outputs from the slave-VCSEL under optimized parameters as entropy sources, we have obtained the PRBs at the dual-channel rate of 160 Gbits/s by adopting the    $m$    least significant bits extraction with logical exclusive-OR (XOR) post-processing.

Experimental results show that DFB-SL under external optical injection is very sensitive to external perturbation and can exhibit various nonlinear dynamical characteristics. Especially, when the laser exhibits the complex dynamical characteristic, its power spectrum is continuous spectrum with several peaks whose frequencies are independent on the power and the frequency of the injection light.",

And the expressions for the reflectivity reductions and reflection delays of the weakly absorptive quarter-wave multilayer dielectric mirrors are derived. Studies are made on the dependence of the reflectivity reductions and reflection delays on the parity of the layer number. Based upon these studies, A set of weighting factors is extracted, which can be used to quantify the contributions of any individual layer to such important mirror characteristics as reflection reduction, reflection delay, etc.",

The results show that, using a bandwidth-enhanced chaotic signal (about 42 GHz bandwidth) from a drive vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (D-VCSEL) to drive all response VCESLs (R-VCSELs) in the broadband chaos network, high-quality chaos synchronization with over 30 GHz bandwidth between two corresponding linear polarization (LP) modes in arbitrary two R-VCSELs can be obtained under optimum injection parameters, while the correlated coefficients between the D-VCSEL and R-VCSELs are low. Taking two LP modes as two different communication channels, this chaos network may possess the potentiality to realize more than 60 GHz high-capacity secret communication based on VCSELs with several GHz of relaxation oscillation frequency. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "All-optical wavelength conversion based on four-wave mixing (FWM) is one of the key technologies in future multi-wavelength telecommunication systems. Besides semiconductor optical amplifiers, semiconductor lasers are also good candidates for wavelength conversion. The influences of the residual Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity mode on the non-degenerated FWM in a distributed-feedback (DFB) laser have been investigated from small to large range frequency detuning, as well as the conversion efficiency of conersion FWM. The experimental results show that the conversion efficiency of FWM can be enhanced obviously by the cavity resonance when the probe wavelength matches the F-P cavity mode; the FWM with high conversion efficiency can be achieved when the frequency detuning between the injection probe frequency and free-running frequency of DFB laser is up to terahertz.",

For coherent superposition reflection strengthening, it can reduce the threshold switching energy of the \u03bb/4 phase-shifted grating, but the switching contrast will decline. With the introduction of negative chirp in \u03bb/4 phase-shifted grating, the switching contrast is greatly improved, but the bistable threshold switching energy will increase.

Especially, some modes, locating at the material gain center of ESECSL, present unique double peak characteristics. Moreover, the primarily theoretical simulations and the physics explanation about these double peak characteristics have been given.

Moreover, after increasing the feedback strength to a certain level, the coherence collapse will happen due to the strong mode competition of DFB-SL, and 10 GHz broadband chaos can be obtained experimentally. In addition, the numerical simulations are executed, and the results agree well with the experimental observations. The simulations also indicate that the feedback strength is a key parameter for controlling nonlinear dynamic behaviors of DFB-SL.",

Based on the bifurcation diagram of the extrema of peak series, it can be found that, after introducing incoherent optical feedback, the nonlinear dynamics of an optically injected SL will follow different routes to chaos oscillation. Period-doubling pulsing route and quasi-periodic pulsing route have been observed, which are different from that found in an optically injected SL without incoherence optical feedback. Mappings of dynamic states in the parameters space are plotted for different incoherence feedback strengths. Compared with an optically injected SL without incoherent optical feedback, a larger expansion of chaos region is observed.",

For the DFB-SL under only current modulation with modulation frequency    $text{f}_{m }= 1.2$    GHz and modulation power    $text{P}_{m }= 22$    dBm, the generated MFC has a bandwidth of about 15.6 GHz within \u00b15.0 dB amplitude variation. Further, introducing continuous-wave optical injection into the current modulated DFB-SL with injection power    $text{P}_{i }= 1170~mu text{W}$    and no frequency detuning between the injection light frequency and the oscillation frequency of the free-running DFB-SL, the bandwidth of MFC can be increased to 57.6 GHz. Through measuring the single sideband (SSB) phase noises of some representative comb lines, the performances of the MFCs generated before and after introducing optical injection are compared, and the SSB phase noises at 10 kHz offset frequency can be increased by 10 dB for the harmonics with frequencies of more than    $40text {f}_{m}$    after adopting optical injection.

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess the clinical value of percutaneous transhepatic biopsy of focal hepatic lesions guided by contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Methods: Two hundred patients with focal hepatic lesions were randomly divided into two groups. All patients underwent percutaneous transhepatic biopsy. One group underwent biopsy indirectly guided by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (experiment-group, one hundred cases), another group underwent biopsy guided by conventional ultrasound (control-group, one hundred cases). The biopsy achievement ratio, puncture times and accurate diagnosis ratio of different character nodules were compared between two groups. Results: The biopsy achievement ratio, of experiment-group was 100%, higher than that of control-group respectively (94%, P<0.05). The average times of puncture of experiment-group was 1.00\u00b10, lower than that of control-group 0.12\u00b10.41, P<0.05). The biopsy achievement ratio of lesions diameter more than 5 cm of experiment group and control group was 100%, 97.56% respectively (P>0.05), accurate diagnosis ratio was 100% and 87.80% respectively (P<0.05), while the biopsy achievement ratio of lesions diameter smaller than 5 cm was 100% and 93.22%, respectively (P>0.05), accurate diagnosis ratio was 96.42% and 93.22% respectively (P>0.05). The biopsy achievement ratio of HCC nodules after PEI of experiment group and control group was 100%, 89.74% (P>0.05), accurate diagnosis ratio was 100% and 84.61%, respectively (P<0.05). Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can improve the biopsy achievement ratio, accurate diagnosis ratio of percutaneous transhepatic biopsy. Especially for the lesions diameter more than 5 cm and HCC nodules after nonoperative therapy, contrast-enhanced ultrasound is helpful to decrease the false negative results of biopsy and the average times of puncture.",

Methods One hundred twenty one patients underwent TRUS with the head scanning probe. Preoperative ultrasonic findings were compared with the pathological results. Results Rectal malignant tumors appeared as hypoechoic masses and benign tumors appeared as hyperechoic nodi on TRUS, which had an overall accuracy rate of 84.0% in rectal cancer staging. The sensitivity and accuracy of TRUS in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis were 90.6% and 85.9%, respectively. There was no statistical difference of rectal carcinoma in the upper and lower level. Conclusions TRUS with head scanning probe is of great value for the pre-operative staging of rectal carcinoma, and it has special advantages for upper level rectal carcinoma and rectal malignant stenosis. Rectal water window and intestinal physiological curves are beneficial for multi-angle scanning to make the detected direction perpendicular to the lesions so as to get precise and perfect imaging resulting in TRUS diagnostic accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Objective To approach the application of color Doppler sonography in differential diagnosis of small hepatic infective lesions and small hepatic carcinomas. Methods Nineteen patients with small hepatic infective lesions (\u2160 group)were studied, all the lesions were in the early stage and the diameters of all the lesions were <3 cm, including the hepatic bacterial abscess in 10, hepatic tubercular lesion in 6, hepatic fungal lesion in 2, hepatic syphilitic lesion in 1. Thirty patients with hepatic carcinoma (C group) of diameter <3 cm were also studied. All the cases were proved by pathology. Every patient was examined on color Doppler sonography. The difference of shape, edge, internal echoes, space-occupying effect and blood flow characteristics of lesions on ultrasonography in the two groups were compared. Results In the \u2160 group, irregular shape was in 16 cases(16/19)and indefinite edge in 15(15/19)vs 6 cases(6/30)and 9(9/30), respecticvely in the C group, all (P<0.05) with significant difference.In I group, all the lesions had no space-occupying effect in 19(19/19) and 16 (16/19) were low internal echoes in nodi vs 23(23/30)and 24 (24/30)in the C group (P>0.05) , without significance. The blood flow signals were detected in 5 cases in I group and 10 cases in C group without significant difference (P>0.05). No perforating branch blood flow or round flow was found in I group, while it was found in 8 cases in C group (P<0.05), with significance difference. Conclusions Color Doppler sonography can display not only the edge and shape of lesions, but also the blood flow characteristics of the lesions, so it may be more effective in differential diagnosis of hepatic infective lesion in early stage and small hepatic carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injection of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microspheres containing cobra venom cytotoxin in nude mice with transplanted human hepatoma.Cytotoxic activity of cytotoxin from cobra venom was determined by using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium method in vitro. Microspheres containing cobra venom cytotoxin were prepared with a double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Forty BALB/c nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously in right flank with hepatoma BEL-7404 cells. Thirty-two mice whose tumor size reached about 1.0 cm in diameter, were randomly assigned into normal saline group, blank microsphers group, cytotoxin group and cytotoxin-PLGA group. Nude mice were intratumorally injected with normal saline, blank microspheres, cytotoxin or cytotoxin-PLGA microspheres respectively. Internal echo characteristics and blood flow of tumors were observed by high-frequency ultrasound every week after treatment. Twenty-six days after treatment, the tumors were removed to calculate the inhibition rate of tumor growth. The tumor, heart, liver and kidney tissues were obtained for histopathological examination.The cytotoxin separated and purified from crude cobra venom caused intense cytotoxic effects to the BEL-7404 cells in vitro. The diameter of PLGA microspheres containing cobra venom cytotoxin was about (34.45+/-9.85)microm. Encapsulation rate was up to (78.13+/-8.92)%, and cumulative amount of cobra venom cytotoxin released from the PLGA microspheres in vitro during 30 days was up to 84.3%. After intratumoral injection, tumor volumes and weights in the cytotoxin-PLGA group were lower than those in the normal saline group, with a tumor growth inhibition rate of 52.36%. Observed under a light microscope, most tumor tissues were necrotic. No obvious morphological change could be seen on the liver, kidney and heart tissues.The above findings indicate that intratumoral injection of cytotoxin-PLGA microspheres has strong antitumor effect and can obviously lessen systemic toxicity, which may provide an effective and feasible method for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of percutaneous quantified ethanol injection (PQEI) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and follow-up by contrast-enhanced gray-scale harmonic ultrasound. Methods: Fifty-four patients with 54 tumoral nodes treated by PQEI were divided into 3 groups. Rescanning those nodes was performed at the end of treatment and 1 month later fro group A, in 2 to 14 months after PQEI for group B and in 24 months after PQEI for group C. Rescanning was completed with techniques of both color Doppler ultrasound and contrast-enhanced gray-scale harmonic ultrasound. The size, internal echo, blood flow and contrast enhancement of nodes were observed. Immediate ultrasound guided biopsies were followed. Results: The size of all nodes after treatment was smaller than that before treatment. In group A, all nodes appeared hyperechoic at the end of treatment and only 11 nodes (52.4%) were hyperechoic in 1 month later follow - up, which was less than that there were 14 hyperechoic nodes (87.5%) in group B and 15 heperechoic nodes (88.2%) in group C. The echogenicity of nodes in group B and C was significantly higher than that in group A (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between group B and C (P>0.05). Blood signals were absent within nodes in all groups. At the end of treatment, the enhancement defect area in nodes of group A was larger than that before treatment on contrast-enhanced gray-scale harmonic ultrasound. Only three nodes in group A had patchy enhancement. Besides relic hepatic carcinoma cells were detected only in 3 nodes in group A, fibrotic scar and necrotic tissue were evident in all other nodes. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced harmonic ultrasound is well promised in efficient evaluation of PQEI for HCC.",

Then the correlation between the peak time and the artery density was analyzed. Results In all nodules, the average peak time of CEUS was (24.60\u00b14.33) s and the average artery density of PHCC was 0.17\u00b10.06/HP. The correlation coefficient between them was -0.72 and it was statistically significant (P<0.05). This indicates the peak time of CEUS become shorter as the artery density become higher. Conclusion The peak time of CEUS is inversely correlated with artery density of PHCC. This indicates we can estimate the blood supply by peak time of CEUS and the biological character for clinical therapy.",

The HCC patients were divided into typical group(group A) with 28 patients and atypical group(group B) with 7 patients according to the period from contrast agent enhancing to washing out. Group C included 13 focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). After the Sono Vue(contrast agent) was injected into the ulnar vein, the contrast agent enhanced beginning time, peak time, washing-out time and persistence time were recorded and statistical analysis was done. After enhanced ultrasonographic examination, all nodular tissues were acquired from ultrasound-guided biopsy and the DNA content was examined on FCM. The rates of the different period of DNA content and the proliferation index(PI) were recorded and aneuploid rates of different groups were counted. Then the statistical analysis was done. In each group of HCC and in all HCC nodules, correlation analysis between enhanced persistence time and tumor cell S phase fraction, proliferation index was done.Results In examination of grey scale enhanced ultrasound, there was significant difference between group A 36.96\u00b14.73 s and group B 64.14\u00b15.43 s in washing-out time(P<0.05), at the same time, there was significant difference between group A and group C 59.69\u00b17.45s (P<0.05). There was significant difference among group A 54.26\u00b110.98s, group B 116.71\u00b112.96 s and group C 169.15\u00b135.03 s in persistence time(P<0.05). In FCM examination, there was significant difference in group A 34.60\u00b14.18%, 50.26\u00b15.64%; in group B 23.65\u00b13.34%, 33.46\u00b14.63% and group C 2.74\u00b10.38%, 4.31\u00b10.92% in tumor cell S phase fraction and proliferation index(P<0.05).The aneuploid tumor cells were found in 16 HCC nodules of group A(16/28), but there was no aneuploid cells found in group B and group C. In all thirty five HCC tumor nodules, the correlation between enhanced persistence time and tumor cell S phase fraction, proliferation index was statistical significance (all P<0.05). Correlation coefficients were -0.77 and -0.81 respectively.Conclusions The study shows that there is negative correlation between enhanced persistence time and tumor cell S phase fraction as well as proliferation index in HCC nodules. The enhanced persistence time may respond to the tumor malignancy to some degree. The shorter the persistence time is, the more malignant the tumor is.",

        "abstract": "With the progress in early clinical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), early detection and diagnosis of HCC have been increasingly pressing. Combined alpha-fetoprotein(AFP) determination and ultrasonography has become the main method for the detection of small HCC; but the relationship between low elevation of AFP and pathologic findings of small HCC has not been well defined. The aim of this study was to assess the value of ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy of intrahepatic nodules and low elevation of serum AFP in the early diagnosis of HCC.Fifty-nine patients with serum AFP exceeding 20 ng/ml and intrahepatic nodules varying from 0.8 cm to 5.0 cm in diameter who had been detected by ultrasonography underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous fine needle biopsy, and cytological staining and histological sectioning were performed at the same time.Among the 59 patients, 11 patients (18.6%) showed AFP level above 400 ng/ml, 5 (8.5%) from 200 ng/ml to 400 ng/ml, 18 (30.5%) from 50 ng/ml to 200 ng/ml and 25 (42.4%) from 20 ng/ml to 50 ng/ml. Follow-up demonstrated that 53 patients (89.8%) had a progressive increase of AFP level. In 58 patients (98.3%) cancer cells were found by cytological staining and/or histological sectioning.In those patients with slightly increased or continuously positive AFP, hepatic carcinoma should be highly suspected when AFP increases gradually and intrahepatic nodules are detected by ultrasonography in follow-up. Once intrahepatic carcinoma nodules are suspected, ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy should be performed as early as possible for early diagnosis and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the value of double real-time gray-scale contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (DRGEU) in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). Methods Eighteen cases of pathologically or clinically proved PVTT and 8 cases of pathologically or clinically proved portal vein blood thrombosis (PVBT) were examined by color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) firstly. Then, double real-time gray-scale contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was carried out in them. Appearances of pulsatile arterial flow in CDFI examination or typical show of \u201cquick enhancement and quick fadeaway\u201d in DRGEU examination were considered as the standards for diagnosing PVTT. Results The accuracy rate of DRGEU in diagnosis of PVTT were 94.4% (17/18), not markedly higher than those of CDFI, which were 83.3% (15/18) (P>0.05). It should be emphasized that 2 of 3 cases that were not detected by CDFI were diagnosed by DRGEU. Conclusions This study suggests that DRGEU is of high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in the diagnosis of PVTT and can fill in the gap of CDFI to improve the detecting rate of PVTT. So, it can guide the clinicians to choose the optimal therapeutic regimen.",

        "abstract": "To discuss the correlation of ultrasonographic grading of varicocele (VC) with the changes of seminal parameters after varicocelectomy.A total of 129 cases of VC were diagnosed by scrotal color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) and graded into 3 groups: VC I, VC II and VC III, according to three different grading indexes: the regurgitant volume of pampiniform plexus veins (PPV), the maximum diameter of PPV and the combination of the regurgitant volume and the maximum diameter of PPV. All the patients underwent high ligation of the spermatic vein and semen analysis was performed before and after varicocelectomy according to the WHO guidelines.With the maximum diameter of PPV as the grading index, there were statistically significant differences in the seminal parameters of VC III (P < 0.05) but not in those of VC I and VC II (P > 0.05) before and after varicocelectomy, while based on the regurgitant volume of PPV or the combination of the regurgitant volume and the maximum diameter of PPV, the differences were insignificant in VC I (P > 0.05), significant in VC II (P < 0.05) and extremely significant in VC III (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found in the rate of sperm abnormality among the 3 groups after varicocelectomy (P > 0.05).Different grading indexes influence the changes of seminal parameters after varicocelectomy. The regurgitant volume of PPV and the combination of the regurgitant volume and the maximum diameter of PPV are more reasonable and reliable as the grading indexes of VC. Different grades of VC respond differently to varicocelectomy. Whether VC I necessitates varicocelectomy needs to be further investigated.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the later effects of ultrasound-guided percutaneous quantified absolute ethanol injection (PQEI) for the treatment of 746 cases with hepatic carcinoma and the significance of follow-up after PQEI. Methods The pathologically proved hepatic carcinoma in 746 cases were treated with PQEI every 2-3 days and 4-10 times per treatment course. Absolute ethanol was also injected into portal vein with tumor thrombi and hepatic arteries. The survival rates of 1-8 years, the recurrence rates in situ as well as in ectopia and recurrence times were calculated.Results The survival rates of 1, 3, 5, 8 years in 746 cases with hepatic carcinoma were 93.7%,73.8%, 53.1% and 47.6%,respectively. The survival rates of 1, 3, 5, 8 years in the cases with hepatic carcinoma\u22643cm in diameter were markedly higher than those of the carcinoma>3cm in diameter (P<0.01). The 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 year recurrence rates in situ in 746 cases were 2.5%, 5.7%, 6.4%, 8.1 % and 8.9%,respectively. The 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 year recurrence rates in ectopia of 746 cases were 11.4%, 32.6%, 47.2%, 65.8% and 81.9%, respectively. The total recurrence person-times were 896. The recurrence rates in situ and in ectopia of the tumors \u22643 cm in diameter were apparently lower than those of the tumors >3cm in diameter (P<0.01). Results of ultrasound contrast examination 1 month to 2 years after PQEI in 87 cases showed that only in 8 tumors >3 cm in diameter had slight enhancement in few sites or no enhancement was found 1 month after one repearted PQEI had course. Seventy-nine in 87 cases showed no enhancement. AFP became negative after PQEI in 82.9%(422/509) cases. Conclusions PQEI has significant later effects on improving the survival rate of hepatic carcinoma patients to prolong patients\u2019 life. Standard follow-up after PQEI is of importance in improving holistic treatment efficacy on hepatic carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the anti-cancer effect of ultrasound-guided intra-tumoral injection of traditional Chinese medicine \"Star-99\" in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to determine whether \"Star-99\" has obvious adverse effects on the body. Methods Twenty-eight human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 transplanted nude mice (including 14 hypodermically implanted mice and 14 orthotopic liver transplanted mice) were randomly divided into 3 groups: Star-99 treatment group (n = 14), ethanol (n =7) and saline (n =7) treatment groups. Ten days after transplantation the study medicines were injected into the tumors of all the nude mice once every 5 days. After 4 injections the nude mice were killed. The 3 dimensions of the tumors were measured by high frequency ultrasound before and after treatment and the tumor growth indexes (TGI) were calculated [ ( post-treatment tumor volume - pre-treatment tumor volume) / pre-treatment tumor volume]. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to detect the serum levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Apoptotic cells were evaluated by TUNEL assay. Liver and kidney function tests (AST, ALT, ALP and BUN) as well as white blood cell counts were determined before and after treatment. After experiment all the nude mice were investigated by autopsy and histological examination for the information of the heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lung and brain. All the experiments were carried out in double blind way. Results The TGI of Star-99 group (0. 080\u00b10.024) was markedly lower than that of saline group (4. 842\u00b11. 293) (P < 0.01). It was also lower than that of ethanol group ( 0.083\u00b10.026) , but the difference was not significant ( P > 0. 05 ) . Serum levels of IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 of Star-99 group were markedly higher than those of ethanol and saline groups ( P < 0. 05 ). The mean apoptotic index (AI) in Star-99 group [ (45.08\u00b15. 39) % ] was significantly higher than those of ethanol group [(13.45\u00b12.54) %] and saline group [(12. 38\u00b13. 91) % ] (P <0. 01). There were no evident changes of liver and kidney function as well as WBCs before and after treatment in the 3 groups. Positive correlation (r =0. 494, P <0. 05) was found between AI and serum level of TNF-\u03b1. Autopsy and histological examination of all the nude mice showed no evident changes of the heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lung and brain. Conclusions It is indicated that Star-99 can enhance the cellular immunity and induce cancer cell apoptosis. The major mechanisms can be as follows: (1) it increases the serum levels of IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 and triggers cellular immunologic function; (2) by inducing cancer cells'apoptosis, it can inhibit and destroy the cancer cells. The mechanism of action of Star-99 is different from that of ethanol. This study provides a new pathway of drug administration and an experimental basis for the treatment of HCC with Chinese herbal medicines, and it also provides an experimental basis for the ultrasound-guided intra-tumoral injection of Chinese medicine \"Star-99\" in clinical application.",

        "abstract": "Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is a serious complication and a major metastatic way of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). But portal vein benign thrombosis(PVBT) always appears in patients with hepatocirrhosis, and PVTT should be differentiated from PVBT. The aim of this study was to probe the value of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy in differential diagnosis of PVTT.Twenty-two HCC patients with portal vein thrombosis and 8 hepatocirrhosis patients with portal vein thrombosis were studied by ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy. Twelve portal vein thrombosis filling portal vein embranchment of the 30 portal vein thrombosis patients were examined by 18G automatic biopsy. The positive rates of aspiration biopsy cytology and histology were calculated and compared with those of automatic biopsy.The positive rates of fine needle aspiration biopsy cytology and histology were 93.3% (28/30) and 90.0% (27/30), respectively. They were not different markedly from that of automatic biopsy 91.7% (11/12). In aspiration biopsy of 22 HCC patients with PVTT, HCC cellular was found in 19 portal vein thrombosis patients (86.4%) by cytology examination and in 18 portal vein thrombosis patients (81.8%) by histology examination. In total, 20 tumor thrombi were detected. The other two were diagnosed as benign thrombosis. No HCC cell and/or tissue was observed in 8 patients with hepatocirrhosis associated with portal vein thrombosis.Ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy in detecting PVTT shows a high positive rate and is of diagnostic value. The positive rate is not apparently different from that of automatic biopsy. Hence the case that fails to be diagnosed by color Doppler flow imaging(CDFI) and pulsed Doppler can be detected early by ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy.",

        "abstract": "To compare the impact of unilateral acute testicular ischemia on the hemodynamics and histology of the contralateral testis of the rabbits under consistent anesthesia with that of the rabbits in the conscious state.Forty-two healthy male white rabbits were randomly divided into an anesthetic group (Group A) to receive injection of sodium pentobarbital (PS) and a non-anesthetic group (Group B), each including a control group of 5 animals (A0 and B0), an incomplete testicular ischemia group of 8 (A1 and B1), and a complete testicular ischemia group of 8 (A2 and B2). Testicular ischemia models were constructed by color Doppler ultrasonography. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was used to observe the perfusion of the contralateral testes before and after ligating and loosening the unilateral spermatic cord in each experimental group. The control animals also underwent CEUS and measurement of the heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) at the corresponding time. Histological structure changes in the contralateral testes of the rabbits were observed in both anesthetic and conscious states.PS anesthesia markedly suppressed the HR and BP of the rabbits. The parameters in Groups of A0, A1 and A2 showed no statistically significant changes after unilateral ligation of the spermatic cord, while Groups B1 and B2 displayed significantly decreased peak-base difference (PBD) and prolonged arrival time (AT) and half time of descending peak intensity (HT). Groups A1, B1 and B2 showed significantly increased PBD and prolonged HT shortly after loosening the spermatic cord. Focal pathological and ultrastructural changes were observed in the contralateral testes of the ischemic rabbits, but no significant difference was found in Johnson's score in comparison with the controls. The apoptotic cells were remarkably increased in Groups A1, B1 and B2.Acute testicular ischemia may induce injury to the contralateral testis to some degree, and a reflexive sympathetic response may cause hemodynamic changes in the non-anesthetic state. And the neural and vascular inhibitory effects of anesthesia could make insignificant changes of blood perfusion in the contralateral testis.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the value of high-frequency color Doppler ultrasonography(CDU)in the diagnosis of the testicular germinal cell tumor (TGCT, germinoma). Methods A comprehensive analysis was performed by observing the 2-dimensional sonograms and the arterial blood flow peak systolic velocity (PSV) , resistance index (RI) in 33 cases with TGCT using high-frequency CDU were conjugated and analysed with related clinical situations, the blood-serum \u03b1FP and \u03b2-hCG. All the cases were pathologically confirmed after operation. Results Among 33 cases with TGCT, seminoma were present in 13 cases, embryonal carcinoma in 4, teratoma in 7, yolk sac tumor in 4, and mixed germ cell tumor in 5. All TGCT possessed individual characteristics on 2-dimensional sonograms. The smallest tumor detected was about 0.4 cm\u00d70.6 cm in size. The blood flow PSV value in TGCT was obviously higher than that of the healthy adults\u2019 intratesticular artery blood flow, whereas the RI value overlapped with the normal reference value greatly. The coincidence of high-frequency CDU in the diagnosis of TGCT was 97%(32/33). The blood-serum tumor marker levels were elevated in 17 patients, of whom 10 showed elevated \u03b1FP levels, 2 showed elevated \u03b2-hCG, and 3 had both \u03b1FP and \u03b2-hCG increased. Conclusions High-frequency CDU, which is capable of detecting testicular tumors in the earlier period plays an important role in the diagnosis of TGCT. While combined with the correlated clinical situations, the blood-serum \u03b1FP and \u03b2-hCG etc, we can obtain further reliable informations for the diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis judgement of the disease.",

Methods Anticancer experiment was done on mice inoculated with the H22 liver cancer cells, and the inhibition of cell proliferation was assayed using sulfur rodamine B (SRB) liguid method. Morphological changes were studied by transmission electron microscopes, and the flow cytometric analysis was performed to detect apoptosis. Results AG-05 could greatly inhibit the tumor growth of the mice. Marked anti-proliferation effect in concentration and time-dependent manners were observed after intervention of AG-05. Morphology changed obviously in that a large number of cells were turgescent and necrotic, and the typical apoptosis phenomena including chromatin margination and apoptotic bodies appeared in part of HepG2 cells. The flow cytometric analysis showed that apoptosis rates of HepG2 cells treated with AG-05 20 \u03bcg/mL, 10 \u03bcg/mL were (20.1\u00b14.3)% and (13.5\u00b1 2.1%), respectively. Conclusions The above findings indicated that the active compound (AG-05) from Chinese traditional medicine \u201c99-star\u201d had strong effect on the liver cancer. Its major mechanisms might be to destroy tumor cells directly and to induce cancer cell apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the localized and qualitative diagnosis of adrenal gland tumors using color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). MethodsCDFI and CT were contrasted in diagnosing 102 patients suspected as adrenal tumors. Ultrasonic images of different kinds of adrenal gland tumors were analysed. ResultsAmong the 102 cases, 94 cases were with adrenal tumors, 3 with adrenal cyst, 2 with adrenal hyperplasia, 2 with renal tumor and with accessory spleen. The diagnostic accuracy in localizing the adrenal gland tumors on CDFI and CT were 92.2%(94/102), 96.1%(98/102), respectively; the qualitative diagnostic accuracy of CDFI and CT were 87.2%(82/94), 89.4%(84/94), respectively; no statistical significance was found between the two groups. Among 89 cases with adrenal gland tumors diagnosed on CDFI, 64 cases were with benign tumors and 25 cases with malignant tumors. The tumor mainly consisted of adrenocortical adenoma, adrenal pheochromocytoma, and metastatic carcinoma counted on 40.4%(36/89), 21.3%(19/89)and 14.6%(13/89), respectively. Adrenocortical adenoma were small in size, and mainly showed hypoechoic or equivalent echoic, while adrenal pheochromocytoma and metastatic carcinoma were larger in size, and mainly showed asymmetrical echoes even with necrosis in the inner part. With regard to other adrenal gland tumors, adrenocortical carcinoma and neuroblastoma mainly presented inhomogeneous echoic, and all myelolipoma showed hyperechoic. In addition, the flow signal was oberserved only in 25.3 % (17/67) of benign adrenal tumors, while it was observed in 80.0 %(20/25) of malignant tumors. ConclusionsThe correct diagnostic [JP3]rates on CDFI in both localizing and differentiating adrenal gland tumors were high. Therefore, CDFI is an important method for detecting adrenal gland tumors,especially it helps us distinguish benign from malignant tumors.",

Methods: Twenty-eight human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 transplanted nude mice, 14 of hypodermically implanted and 14 of orthotopic liver transplanted, were randomly divided into three groups of which 14 mice with Star-99, and 7 with ethanol and saline respectively. Ten days after the transplantation the medicines were injected into the tumors of all the nude mice once every 5 days. After 4 injections the nude mice were killed. The diameters of three dimension of the tumors were measured by high frequency ultrasound before and after the treatment and the tumor growth indexes* (TGI) were calculated. Radioimmunoassay was used to detect the serum levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The tumor tissues were sent for flow cytometry (FCM) DNA analysis. Apoptotic cells were visualized by TUNEL assay. All the experiments were carried out by double blind method. Results: The TGI of Star-99 group (0.076\u00b10.024) was markedly lower than that of the saline group (4.654\u00b11.283) (P<0.01). It also seemed to be lower than that of the ethanol group (0.082\u00b10.028), but not significantly different (P>0.05). Serum levels of IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 were markedly higher than those of ethanol group and saline groups (P<0.05). The mean apoptotic index (AI: percentage of TUNEL signal positive cells) in Star-99 group (48.98\u00b15.09 %) was significantly higher than that of the ethanol group (11.95\u00b12.24 %) and the saline group (10.48\u00b13.85 %) (P<0.01). FCM DNA analysis showed that the appearance rate of the apoptosis peak in Srar-99 group was 92.9 %, markedly higher than that of the ethanol group (14.3 %) and the saline group (0.0 %) (P<0.01). Correlation (r=0.499, P<0.05) was found between AI and serum level of TNF-\u03b1. Conclusion: Star-99 has an effect on the elevation of the serum levels of IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1. It indicates that Star-99 has the function of enhancing the cellular immunity and inducing cancer cell apoptosis. The correlation between AI and serum level of TNF-\u03b1 indicates that the elevation of the serum of TNF-\u03b1 induced by Star-99 may be an important factor in the promotion of the hepatic cancer cell apoptosis. Star-99 has strong effects on the inhibition and destruction of cancer cells. Its curative effect is as good as ethanol. Its major mechanisms can be as follows: (1) it increases the serum levels of IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 and triggers cellular immunity. (2) It can induce cancer cells apoptosis, the effective mechanism of the Star-99 is different from that of the ethanol. The mechanisms of triggering the immunologic function of the organism and inducing cell apoptosis are, of particular significance. This study will provide a new pathway of drug administration and an experimental basis for the treatment of HCC with Chinese herbal, and the study of Star-99 in the treatment of tumor is of profound significance with good prospects.",

Methods Thirteen cases with hepatic specific infection underwent two- dimensional ultrasound (2-DUS) and color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). Contrast-enchancement ultrasound were adopted in 8 of them. All cases were conducted ultrasound-guided biopsy.Results Hepatic fungal infection in 5 cases mainly showed small single or disseminated hypoechoic leisions with diffenrent size in the liver; Some leisions showed hyperechoic strips round the periphery, Minor leisions showed a kind of typical manifestation of metastatic hepatic carcinoma so called \u201cbull eye\u201d. In 6 hepatic tuberculosis cases, 2 had hepatomegaly with heterogenous echoes and irregular hyperechoic and hypoechoic sheets; 3 cases presented different sized small disseminated hypoechoic nodules; another one revealed single mixed echoic nodule with inner necrosis. With regard to hepatic syphilis, one case presented hepatomegaly with heterogenous echoes, wihle the other showed simply irregular hypoechoes. No flow signal was seen in the inner part of all leisions in thirteen cases with hepatic specific infection. CEUS showed there were no enhancement in the inner part of leisions during the arterial,the portal vein and the delayed phases; only hepatic fungal infection in 2 cases showed a little enhancement in the periphery in the early arterial phase. Conclusions 2-DUS and CDFI are useful in diagnosing hepatic specific infection.Moreover, no enhancement was seen in the inner part of the leisions on CEUS which was helpful for diagnosis.In addition, ultrasound-guided biopsy may be able to confirm the majority of hepatic infection.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the characteristics of ultrasonography and color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) in cholangiocarcinoma (CCC). Methods One hundred sixty-nine patients with cholangiocarcinoma were examined by 2-D ultrasound. Among them 76 cases(44.97%)were also examined on color Doppler ultrasonography. The sites,borders,sizes,the inner echoes of the tumors,the diameters of the intrahepatic dilated bile ducts and the distribution pattern of color Doppler flow signals in peripheral and inside the tumors were observed and recorded. The ultrasonic types of CCC were classified according to the appearances on 2-D ultrasound. Results The ultrasonic images of 169 CCC were classified into clump type(108 cases),nodular type (20),stenosis type (13 ),cystic type (9) ,embolism type (12) and complex type (7). Two or more than two types were included in 7 cases. The ultrasonic diagnostic accuracy rate was 93.49%(158/169). Among the 11 misdiagnostic patients 5 cases were only diagnosed as intrahepatic biliary duct cholelithiasis,4 were diagnosed hepatic abscesses,and 2 were considered intrahepatic bile duct cystic dilatation. Eighty-eight(88/169,52.07%)CCC cases at porta hepatis were the majority of the study group. The next one was those in the left livers(56/169,33.14%). The intrahepatic bile ducts proximal to the tumors in 159 (94.08%) cases were dilated,59 cases(59/169,34.91%)of CCC were complicated with cholelithiasis. In images of CCC with cholelithiasis,a heap of hyperechoic calculi was inside the tumors with obvious echo shadowing,and the bile duct walls became indefinable. CCC complicated with hepatic abscesses were in 14 cases (14/169,8.28%),demonstrating hypoechoic liquid areas inside or nearby the tumors. The solid echoes could be seen in the dilated bile ducts nearby the liquid areas. Only 11 cases (11/76,14.47%) showed abundant arterial and venous CDFI signals in the tumors. The branches of the portal veins (PV) were wrapped up by the tumors in 49 cases (49/76,64.47%)and result in the disappearance of CDFI signals or presence of thinner color Doppler flow beams in those branches,of which 22 cases (22/49,44.90%) showed the blood flow beams of the hepatic arterial branches (HA) parallel to the PV; 27 cases (27/49,55.10%) showed the blood signals disappeared in both the portal veins and the hepatic arteries in the tumors. Conclusions The sonographic characteristics of CCC are the shapes of the tumors,unclear boundaries defined,inner echoes variable,the dilated bile ducts proximal to obstructed positions lated and adsence of CDFI signals of the portal vein branches. To fully recognize the sonographic characteristics of CCC may improve the ultrasonic diagnostic rate before operation and provide the diagnostic evidence for the clinic.",

Methods Using HE staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) methods, the morphological changes of the apoptosis of HepG_2 cells induced directly by Star-99 were detected. Results After direct exposure to \u201cStar-99\u201d for 48 h, the live cancer cells showed typically morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis under light microscope (by HE staining) and TEM. The liver cancer cells became round and shrunk, then the cells fell to pieces and its refractions floated up, the cytoplasts became eosinophilous and the karyons condensed and became bluish dark by HE staining. The karyons fragmented or the karyotin broke down to form apoptotic corpuscles of varying sizes. Apoptotic cells in different phases were observed by TUNEL.Conclusions Chinese medicine \u201cStar-99\u201d can directly induce extensive apoptosis of HepG_2 cells. The apoptotic effect of \u201cStar-99\u201d on tumor cells may play a key role in its anticancer activities, thus \u201cStar-99\u201d is a new and promising apoptosis-inducer in the treatment of liver cancer.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers a cloud based system involving extensive image data transmission and storage. For such systems, high-performance images transmission and storage methods are crucial, as the total cost of the system mainly depends on the data volume of storage and transmission. In this paper, we propose an encrypted image transmission and storage framework based on kernel regression. Kernel regression (KR) based methods can restore the image from its downsampled version with low computational cost, however, have low quality around edges. To overcome this issue, we propose a Laplace guided KR method (LKR), in which a novel weighted Laplace map is used to refine the smoothing kernel in KR, and the key insight of LKR is that KR based methods can better estimate edges when using smoothing kernels with edges information. We also discuss the encryption method and the Laplace image coding method in detail. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "With the pervasiveness of smart phones and the advance of wireless body sensor networks (BSNs), mobile Healthcare (m-Healthcare), which extends the operation of Healthcare provider into a pervasive environment for better health monitoring, has attracted considerable interest recently. However, the flourish of m-Healthcare still faces many challenges including information security and privacy preservation. In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving opportunistic computing framework, called SPOC, for m-Healthcare emergency. With SPOC, smart phone resources including computing power and energy can be opportunistically gathered to process the computing-intensive personal health information (PHI) during m-Healthcare emergency with minimal privacy disclosure. In specific, to leverage the PHI privacy disclosure and the high reliability of PHI process and transmission in m-Healthcare emergency, we introduce an efficient user-centric privacy access control in SPOC framework, which is based on an attribute-based access control and a new privacy-preserving scalar product computation (PPSPC) technique, and allows a medical user to decide who can participate in the opportunistic computing to assist in processing his overwhelming PHI data. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed SPOC framework can efficiently achieve user-centric privacy access control in m-Healthcare emergency. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations demonstrate the SPOC's effectiveness in term of providing high-reliable-PHI process and transmission while minimizing the privacy disclosure during m-Healthcare emergency.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) allows billions of physical objects to be connected to collect and exchange data for offering various applications, such as environmental monitoring, infrastructure management, and home automation. On the other hand, IoT has unsupported features (e.g., low latency, location awareness, and geographic distribution) that are critical for some IoT applications, including smart traffic lights, home energy management and augmented reality. To support these features, fog computing is integrated into IoT to extend computing, storage and networking resources to the network edge. Unfortunately, it is confronted with various security and privacy risks, which raise serious concerns towards users. In this survey, we review the architecture and features of fog computing and study critical roles of fog nodes, including real-time services, transient storage, data dissemination and decentralized computation. We also examine fog-assisted IoT applications based on different roles of fog nodes. Then, we present security and privacy threats towards IoT applications and discuss the security and privacy requirements in fog computing. Further, we demonstrate potential challenges to secure fog computing and review the state-of-the-art solutions used to address security and privacy issues in fog computing for IoT applications. Finally, by defining several open research issues, it is expected to draw more attention and efforts into this new architecture.",

        "abstract": "5G network is considered as a key enabler in meeting continuously increasing demands for the future Internet of Things (IoT) services, including high data rate, numerous devices connection, and low service latency. To satisfy these demands, network slicing and fog computing have been envisioned as the promising solutions in service-oriented 5G architecture. However, security paradigms enabling authentication and confidentiality of 5G communications for IoT services remain elusive, but indispensable. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure service-oriented authentication framework supporting network slicing and fog computing for 5G-enabled IoT services. Specifically, users can efficiently establish connections with 5G core network and anonymously access IoT services under their delegation through proper network slices of 5G infrastructure selected by fog nodes based on the slice/service types of accessing services. The privacy-preserving slice selection mechanism is introduced to preserve both configured slice types and accessing service types of users. In addition, session keys are negotiated among users, local fogs and IoT servers to guarantee secure access of service data in fog cache and remote servers with low latency. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework through simulations to demonstrate its efficiency and feasibility under 5G infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Compared with traditional power grid, smart grid has several distinguished features, i.e., distributed energy, large-capacity, robust to load fluctuations, and close consumer-grid interactions. Demand response is vital for smart grid, which is expected to save energy, maintain supply-demand balance, and reduce consumers' electricity bills. Meanwhile, it is paramount important to preserve consumers privacy and cyber security in smart grid. To tackle these challenging issues, in this paper, we propose an efficient demand response (EDR) scheme which utilizes the homomorphic encryption to achieve privacy-preserving demand aggregation and efficient response. Unlike existing schemes, the proposed EDR scheme can also achieve forward secrecy in addition to security features including confidentiality, authenticity and integrity. Extensive analysis demonstrates its security, and efficiency in terms of the computation and communication overhead.",

        "abstract": "Service-oriented vehicular networks support diverse infrastructure-based commercial services including Internet access, real-time traffic concerns, video streaming, and content distribution. The success of service delivery in vehicular networks depends on the underlying communication system to enable the user devices to connect to a large number of communicating peers and even to the Internet. This poses many new research challenges, especially in the aspects of security, user privacy, and billing. In this article we first identify the key requirements of authentication, privacy preservation, and billing for service delivery in vehicular networks. We then review the existing industrial and academic efforts on service- oriented vehicular networks. We also point out two security challenges, minimizing vehicleto- infrastructure authentication latency and distributed public key revocation, which are considered among the most challenging design objectives in service-oriented vehicular networks. A novel fast vehicle-to-infrastructure authentication based on a vehicle mobility prediction scheme and an infrastructure-based short-time certificate management scheme are then proposed to address these two challenges. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.",

With SPRING, Roadside Units (RSUs) deployed along the roadside can assist in packet forwarding to achieve highly reliable transmissions. In specific, we first heuristically define how to evaluate each traffic intersection's social degree in a vehicular DTN. Based on the social degree information, we then strategically place RSUs at some high-social intersections. As a result, these RSUs can provide tremendous assistance in temporarily storing packets and helping packet forwarding to achieve high delivery ratio. Performance evaluations via extensive simulations demonstrate the SPRING's efficiency. In addition, detailed security analyses show that the proposed SPRING can achieve conditional privacy preservation and resist most attacks existing in vehicular DTNs.",

The proposed protocol not only provides anonymity from all the intermediate nodes, but also integrates the authenticated key exchange mechanisms into the routing algorithm design. Furthermore, a new attack on anonymous services, called snare attack, is introduced, where a compromised node lures a very important node (VIN) into communicating with him and traces back to the VIN by following the route path. An adversary can then snare the VIN and launch decapitation strike on the VIN. Finally, we present a novel DECOY mechanism as a countermeasure to enhance anonymity of VINs and defeat snare attack.",

By propagating the authenticated emergence message on deer-vehicle collision with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, the chain-reaction accident could be mitigated. However, the long delay imposed by traditional signature based authentication may weaken the effectiveness of such message propagation. In this paper, in order to accelerate the propagation, we propose a new online/offline Rabin signature scheme integrated in an authenticated emergence message propagation model. With the proposed signature scheme, the emergence message can be quickly signed and verified, and thus the propagation is accelerated.

For many recently introduced secure MSN data communication schemes, attribute-based encryption is often adopted to preserve user privacy and prevent outside attackers from eavesdropping. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure user revocation scheme to address inside attacks based on an attribute-based encryption technique. The proposed scheme enables a trusted authority (TA) to flexibly control the data decryption capability of mobile social users. It disables malicious users from decrypting any data packet. As a result, proper user behavior is encouraged, inside attacks are reduced, and network security is enhanced. Through the analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed user revocation scheme is able to resist attribute collusion attacks and revoke collusion attacks. Extensive simulation results further confirm that the proposed scheme has much smaller communication overhead and much shorter delay than the existing solution [1].",

        "abstract": "In our aging society, mHealthcare social network (MHSN) built upon wireless body sensor network (WBSN) and mobile communications provides a promising platform for the seniors who have the same symptom to exchange their experiences, give mutual support and inspiration to each other, and help forwarding their health information wirelessly to a related eHealth center. However, there exist many challenging security issues in MHSN such as how to securely identify a senior who has the same symptom, how to prevent others who don't have the symptom from knowing someone's symptom? In this paper, to tackle these challenging security issues, we propose a secure samesymptom-based handshake (SSH) scheme. Specifically, in the proposed SSH scheme, each patient is granted with a pseudo-ID and its private key corresponding to his symptom. When two patients meet, only if they have the same symptom, they can use their private keys to make mutual authentication. With the provable security technique, we demonstrate the proposed SSH is secure in the MHSN scenarios. Moreover, we also discuss a promising application - social-based patient health information (PHI) collaborative reporting in MHSN, and conduct extensive simulations to evaluate its efficiency in terms of PHI delivery ratio and reporting delay.",

HSN users are tagged with formalized attributes. The attribute-oriented authentication scheme enables each HSN user to generate an attribute proof for itself, where its sensitive attributes are anonymized. By verifying provided attribute proof, other users are able to know what attributes an HSN user has. The attribute-oriented transmission scheme enables an HSN user to encrypt his/her health information into a ciphertext bonded with a customized access policy. The access policy is defined by a target set of attributes. Only users who satisfy the access policy are able to decrypt the ciphertext. Through security analysis, we show that the proposed schemes can effectively resist various attacks including forgery attack, attribute-trace attack, eavesdropping attack, and collusion attack. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that both schemes can offer satisfactory performance in helping HSN users to share health information.",

        "abstract": "It is believed that automated valet parking (AVP) system has great potential to mitigate the parking headache for the future smart city, as it can provide on-demand parking services, bringing immense benefits from energy saving for vehicles to time saving for drivers. For an AVP system, parking reservation is an indispensable part so that vehicles can accomplish automated parking in accordance with the reserved parking information. However, the reservation requests may not only reveal the driver identity, but also disclose his/her sensitive locations, e.g., the most visited places, which are of great concerns to users. To deal with this challenge, the anonymous techniques can be naturally applied during parking reservation, but directly applying the anonymous techniques in AVP will introduce a new security issue, i.e., the anonymous user may maliciously crash the AVP system by repetitively sending the reservation requests, which is called \u201cdouble-reservation attack.\u201d In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving reservation scheme for securing AVP system. Specifically, each anonymous user must have only one valid reservation token at any moment, and the token can only be used for booking one vacant parking space once. The proposed scheme does not only preserve the useru0027s identity privacy and location privacy but also prevents the \u201cdouble-reservation attack\u201d based on several elegant building blocks, i.e., zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge and proxy resignature. Detailed security analysis confirms the security properties of our proposed scheme. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to compare our proposed scheme with three previous schemes, and the experiment results demonstrate that our scheme is also much efficient in a WiFi-based testbed.",

        "abstract": "Node compromise attack is a serious threat to the successful deployment of wireless sensor networks. It is a multiple-stage attack, which usually consists of three stages: physically capturing and compromising sensor nodes; redeploying the compromised nodes back to the sensor network; and compromised sensor nodes rejoining the network and launching attack. Over the last few years, much previous work has tackled the node compromise attack in the late stage, either in the second stage or in the third stage. As a result, the protection measures are often ineffective. In this paper, we will make the first effort on addressing the node compromise problem in the first stage, and present a new couple-based scheme to detect the node compromise attack in early stage. Specifically, after sensor nodes are deployed, they first build couples in ad hoc pattern. Then, the nodes within the same couple can monitor each other to detect any node compromise attempt. Extensive simulation results are given to demonstrate the high detection rate of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "As a prime target of the quality of privacy in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), location privacy is imperative for VANETs to fully flourish. Although frequent pseudonym changing provides a promising solution for location privacy in VANETs, if the pseudonyms are changed in an improper time or location, such a solution may become invalid. To cope with the issue, in this paper, we present an effective pseudonym changing at social spots (PCS) strategy to achieve the provable location privacy. In particular, we first introduce the social spots where several vehicles may gather, e.g., a road intersection when the traffic light turns red or a free parking lot near a shopping mall. By taking the anonymity set size as the location privacy metric, we then develop two anonymity set analytic models to quantitatively investigate the location privacy that is achieved by the PCS strategy. In addition, we use game-theoretic techniques to prove the feasibility of the PCS strategy in practice. Extensive performance evaluations are conducted to demonstrate that better location privacy can be achieved when a vehicle changes its pseudonyms at some highly social spots and that the proposed PCS strategy can assist vehicles to intelligently change their pseudonyms at the right moment and place.",

        "abstract": "There are always frustrations for drivers in finding parking spaces and being protected from auto theft. In this paper, to minimize the drivers' hassle and inconvenience, we propose a new intelligent secure privacy-preserving parking scheme through vehicular communications. The proposed scheme is characterized by employing parking lot RSUs to surveil and manage the whole parking lot and is enabled by communication between vehicles and the RSUs. Once vehicles that are equipped with wireless communication devices, which are also known as onboard units, enter the parking lot, the RSUs communicate with them and provide the drivers with real-time parking navigation service, secure intelligent antitheft protection, and friendly parking information dissemination. In addition, the drivers' privacy is not violated. Performance analysis through extensive simulations demonstrates the efficiency and practicality of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "A challenging issue in Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is to quantify network attributes with respect to security. This paper presents a model-based semi-quantitative approach for evaluating the security of enterprise networks. Instead of focusing on particular attacks/intrusions, our approach aims at characterizing attacker behaviors by examining attacker intent, objective, and attack consequence, which are essential for enforcing an attack scheme. In particular, an attack scheme involving several atomic attacks is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process: a goal-directed attacker takes a sequence of actions to achieve the malicious goal, and a reward signal is used as feedback to integrate the attacker's intent, cost and objective and guides its advances. It is also used to measure attack impact, from security analyst's economic perspective, by considering the significance of network assets. Our approach provides network administrators a useful tool for performing better countermeasures during the risk management process. We carry out a real trace study to demonstrate its feasibility in practice and validate its performance.",

        "title": "TUA: A Novel Compromise-Resilient Authentication Architecture for Wireless Mesh Networks",
        "abstract": "User authentication is essential in service-oriented communication networks to identify and reject any unauthorized network access. The state-of-the-art practice in securing wireless networks is based on the authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) framework where one or multiple identical and duplicated AAA servers are adopted to authenticate mobile users (MUs), handle authorization requests, and collect accounting data. However, the conventional AAA framework cannot tolerate a server compromise event due to misuse, misconfiguration, and malicious access, etc., which may cause serious damages and resource abuses to the network operation. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm toward a compromise-resilient authentication architecture in service-oriented wireless mesh networks (WMNs) based on the (t, n) threshold signature technique, termed Threshold User Authentication (TUA) scheme. With the TUA scheme, only t or more out of n AAA servers in the WMN can cooperatively grant the network access to a MU, while any t-1 or less cannot. Detailed protocol-aspect design and implementations are presented. Extensive analysis on efficiency and reliability of authentication functionality is conducted to gain a deeper understanding on the parameter settings and optimization, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the TUA scheme. We conclude that the proposed authentication scheme can contribute to the WMN network design in metropolitan areas where numerous mesh points (MPs) coexist and are managed under a single control plane with multiple distributed AAA servers.",

In the case of the absence of an RSU, we further propose a supplementary scheme, where vehicles would cooperatively work to probabilistically verify only a small percentage of these mes- sage signatures based on their own computing capacity. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed scheme. It is demonstrated that RAISE yields a much better performance than previously reported counterparts in terms of message loss ratio (LR) and delay.",

        "abstract": "Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are a class of networks characterized by lack of guaranteed connectivity, typically low frequency of encounters between DTN nodes and long propagation delays within the network. As a result, the message propagation process in DTNs follows a store-carry-and-forward manner, and the in-transit bundle messages can be opportunistically routed towards the destinations through intermittent connections under the hypothesis that each individual DTN node is willing to help with forwarding. Unfortunately, there may exist some selfish nodes, especially in a cooperative network like DTN, and the presence of selfish DTN nodes could cause catastrophic damage to any well designed opportunistic routing scheme and jeopardize the whole network. In this paper, to address the selfishness problem in DTNs, we propose a practical incentive protocol, called Pi, such that when a source node sends a bundle message, it also attaches some incentive on the bundle, which is not only attractive but also fair to all participating DTN nodes. With the fair incentive, the selfish DTN nodes could be stimulated to help with forwarding bundles to achieve better packet delivery performance. In addition, the proposed Pi protocol can also thwart various attacks, which could be launched by selfish DTN nodes, such as free ride attack, layer removing and adding attacks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Pi protocol in terms of high delivery ratio and lower average delay.",

        "abstract": "Service-oriented vehicular networks support diverse infrastructure-based commercial services including Internet access, real-time traffic concerns, video streaming, and content distribution. The success of service delivery in vehicular networks depends on the underlying communication system to enable the user devices to connect to a large number of communicating peers and even to the Internet. This poses many new research challenges, especially in the aspects of security, user privacy, and billing. In this article we first identify the key requirements of authentication, privacy preservation, and billing for service delivery in vehicular networks. We then review the existing industrial and academic efforts on service-oriented vehicular networks. We also point out two security challenges, minimizing vehicle-to-infrastructure authentication latency and distributed public key revocation, which are considered among the most challenging design objectives in service-oriented vehicular networks. A novel fast vehicle-to-infrastructure authentication based on a vehicle mobility prediction scheme and an infrastructure-based short-time certificate management scheme are then proposed to address these two challenges.",

In the system, the resource allocation scheme enables the distributed cloud servers to cooperatively assign the servers to the requested users under the load balance condition. Thus, the service delay for users is minimized. In addition, a traffic-shaping algorithm is proposed. The traffic-shaping algorithm converts the user health data traffic to the nonhealth data traffic such that the capability of traffic analysis attacks is largely reduced. Through the numerical analysis, we show the efficiency of the proposed traffic-shaping algorithm in terms of service delay and privacy preservation. Furthermore, through the simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation scheme significantly reduces the service delay compared to two other alternatives using jointly the short queue and distributed control law.",

        "abstract": "Smart grid has recently emerged as the next generation of power grid due to its distinguished features, such as distributed energy control, robust to load fluctuations, and close user-grid interactions. As a vital component of smart grid, demand response can maintain supply-demand balance and reduce users' electricity bills. Furthermore, it is also critical to preserve user privacy and cyber security in smart grid. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving demand response (EPPDR) scheme which employs a homomorphic encryption to achieve privacy-preserving demand aggregation and efficient response. In addition, an adaptive key evolution technique is further investigated to ensure the users' session keys to be forward secure. Security analysis indicates that EPPDR can achieve privacy-preservation of electricity demand, forward secrecy of users' session keys, and evolution of users' private keys. In comparison with an existing scheme which also achieves forward secrecy, EPPDR has better efficiency in terms of computation and communication overheads and can adaptively control the key evolution to balance the trade-off between the communication efficiency and security level.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an RFID-based privacy-preserving children tracking (REACT) scheme for helping locate missing children in large amusement parks and other public venues. The scheme is characterized by the cooperation among RFID readers, storage nodes and control center, which are strategically deployed across the amusement park, as well as employees and visitors in the park. When a passive RFID tag, physically attached on a child, approaches an RFID reader, the reader will process the tag information. The reader then forwards the information to a storage node through a pocket switched network formed by employees and visitors in the park. When locating a lost child is requested, the system is able to track the missing child by querying the tag information stored in the storage nodes. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed REACT scheme achieves child's identity privacy, unlinkable location privacy and forward security. In addition, extensive simulations demonstrate that as more visitors participate in the pocket switched network, the performance of our proposed REACT scheme increases which directly improves the efficiency for the locating lost children.",

        "abstract": "Due to the dynamic topology and non infrastructure, network participants cooperate with their neighbors to route packets. The lack of centralized services allows mobile ad hoc networks to be easily and swiftly deployed, but make it difficult to check others' identities on the other hand. Cryptographic tools have been introduced to secure group communications, such as private and public key infrastructure. The autonomous and distributed nature of mobile ad hoc network demands a decentralized authentication service, where public key infrastructure is considered a better solution. Public key infrastructure can ensure both confidentiality and authenticity, but it is impractical to provide an online trusted third party as certificate authority (CA) for mobile ad hoc network. In this paper, we proposed a new key management protocol which utilizes certificate graphs and distributed certificate authorities. Certificate graph maintained by each user represents the trust among his neighbors, then the maximum clique of certificate graph is selected to be CAs. Based on the assumption that initial certificate graph building is secure, good users have more friends while bad ones have less, thus a reliable group can be constructed. The most trustful subset of these good users -the maximum clique - is elected as the governor of this group, which takes the responsibility of certificate authentication.",

        "abstract": "Wireless metropolitan area sharing networks (WMSNs) are wide-area wireless networks with nodes owned and managed by independent wireless Internet service providers (WISPs). To support seamless roaming in emerging WMSNs, in this paper, we propose a localized and distributed authentication and billing architecture that aims at enabling efficient and privacy-preserving mutual authentication between mobile users (MUs) and WISPs. User anonymity and identity privacy can be protected, even in the presence of collusion between WISPs and a roaming broker (RB), which is considered to be the strongest user privacy protection. An efficient billing architecture is introduced and performed in the same stage of roaming, where U-tokens are defined and can be purchased by MUs from an RB as authentication credentials for the MUs to access the wireless network. The WISPs, thus, can cash the collected U-tokens in the RB for payment. We show that the proposed authentication and billing architecture can support localized inter-WISP authentication through the divisible blind signature scheme and a local witness strategy. A detailed analysis on a number of performance metrics, such as computation time and power consumption, is given to validate the performance of the proposed architectures.",

        "abstract": "Delay tolerant networks (DTNs) provide a promising solution to support delay tolerant applications in areas where end-to-end network connectivity is not available. In DTNs, the intermediate nodes on a communication path are expected to store, carry and forward the in-transit messages (bundles) in an opportunistic way, which is also named as opportunistic data forwarding. Opportunistic data forwarding depends on the hypothesis that each individual node is ready to forward packets for others. This, however, might be easily violated due to the existence of selfish nodes or even malicious ones, who may be reluctant to serve as the bundle relays to save their precious wireless resources. To address this problem, we propose a secure credit based incentive scheme to stimulate bundle forwarding cooperation among DTNs nodes. The proposed scheme can be implemented in a fully distributed way to thwart various attacks without relying on any tamper-proof hardware. In addition, we introduce several efficiency optimization techniques to improve the overall efficiency by exploiting the unique characteristics of DTNs. Extensive simulations confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

Compared with currently existing public key based packet authentication schemes for security and privacy, the communication and computation overhead of TSVC can be significantly reduced due to the short message authentication code (MAC) tag attached in each packet for the packet authentication, by which only a fast hash operation is required to verify each packet. Simulation results demonstrate that TSVC maintains acceptable packet latency with much less packet overhead, while significantly reducing the packet loss ratio compared with that of the existing public key infrastructure (PKI) based schemes, especially when the road traffic is heavy.",

        "abstract": "Smart sensing and wireless communication technologies enable the electric power grid system to deliver electricity more efficiently through the dynamic analysis of the electricity demand and supply. The current solution is to extend the traditional static electricity pricing strategy to a time-based one where peak-time prices are defined to influence electricity usage behavior of customers. However, the time-based pricing strategy is not truly dynamic and the electricity resource cannot be optimally utilized in real time. In this paper, we propose a usage-based dynamic pricing (UDP) scheme for smart grid in a community environment, which enables the electricity price to correspond to the electricity usage in real time. In the UDP scheme, to simplify price management and reduce communication overhead, we introduce distributed community gateways as proxies of the utility company to timely respond to the price enquiries from the community customers. We consider both community-wide electricity usage and individual electricity usage as factors into price management: a customer gets higher electricity unit price if its own electricity usage becomes larger under certain conditions of the community-wide collective electricity usage. Additionally, we protect the privacy of the customers by restricting the disclosure of the individual electricity usage to the community gateways. Lastly, we provide privacy and performance analysis to demonstrate that the UDP scheme supports real-time dynamic pricing in an efficient and privacy-preserving manner.",

Ensuring location privacy for an MU is an effort to prevent any other party from learning the MU's current and past locations. In this paper, we propose a novel anonymous mutual authentication protocol with provable link-layer location privacy preservation. We first formulate the security model on the link-layer, forward-secure location privacy, which is characterized by the fact that even when an attacker corrupts an MU's current location privacy, the attacker should be kept from knowing how long the MU has stayed at the current location. Then, based on the newly devised keys with location and time awareness, a novel anonymous mutual authentication protocol between the MUs and the access point (AP) is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first developed anonymous mutual authentication scheme that can achieve provable link-layer, forward-secure location privacy. To improve efficiency, a preset in idle technique is exercised in the proposed scheme, which is further compared with a number of previously reported counterparts through extensive performance analysis.",

        "abstract": "Addressing security and privacy issues is a prerequisite for a market-ready vehicular communication network. Although recent related studies have already addressed most of these issues, few of them have taken scalability issues into consideration. When the traffic density becomes larger, a vehicle cannot verify all signatures of the messages sent by its neighbors in a timely manner, which results in message loss. Communication overhead as another issue has also not been well addressed in previously reported studies. To deal with these issues, this paper introduces a novel RSU-aided messages authentication scheme, called RAISE. With RAISE, roadside units (RSUs) are responsible for verifying the authenticity of the messages sent from vehicles and for notifying the results back to vehicles. In addition, our scheme adopts the k-anonymity approach to protect user identity privacy, where an adversary cannot associate a message with a particular vehicle. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the proposed scheme, which demonstrates that RAISE yields much better performance than any of the previously reported counterparts in terms of message loss ratio and delay.",

With two-factor authentication, the wireless personal devices can be further promoted to more security demanding and mission-critical applications, such as e-commerce, home surveillance, and medical monitoring, etc. Facility access is one of applications that have demonstrated a tremendous market potential for replacing the conventional physical key approach. In this paper, we present a novel keyless facility access control system by using wireless personal devices, where the devices serve as a second authentication factor to assure security. The proposed system is not only cost-efficient, but also capable of mitigating security threats existing in the traditional key control system. Furthermore, the proposed authentication protocol is featured in two different authentication processes for the first time and subsequent accesses by using a one-time authentication mechanism based on one-way hash chain while considering the resource constraints of the wireless personal devices and E-lock. Finally, a role-based access control (RBAC) system is adopted to reduce the complexity of key maintenance.",

        "abstract": "Smart grid enables two-way communications between smart meters and operation centers to collect real-time power consumption of customers to improve flexibility, reliability, and efficiency of the power system. It brings serious privacy issues to customers, since the meter readings possibly expose customers\u2019 activities in the house. Data encryption can protect the readings, but lengthens the data size. Secure data aggregation improves communication efficiency and preserves customers\u2019 privacy, while fails to support dynamic billing, or offer integrity protection against public collectors, which may be hacked in reality. In this paper, we define a new security model to formalize the misbehavior of collectors, in which the misbehaving collectors may launch pollution attacks to corrupt power consumption data. Under this model, we propose a novel privacy-preserving smart metering scheme to prevent pollution attacks for the balance of security and efficiency in smart grid. It achieves end-to-end security, data aggregation, and integrity protection against the misbehaving collectors, which act as local gateways to collect and aggregate usage data and forward to operation centers. As a result, the misbehaving collectors cannot access or corrupt power usage data of customers. In addition, we design a dynamic billing mechanism based on individual power consumption maintained on collectors with the verification of customers. Our analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves secure smart metering and verifiable dynamic billing against misbehaving collectors with low computational and communication overhead.",

        "abstract": "Due to the nature of wireless ad hoc networks such as dynamic infrastructure and non-centralized management, the routing process has a huge exposure to malicious hacking and intrusions. This fact results in a likelihood of node compromise, leading to a disruption of the legitimate network functions/services. Most reported studies in coping with the problem have focused on the effort of protection on route discovery and data transmission against various attacks. In this paper, we solve the problem from a different perspective by targeting the node compromise revocation, i.e., isolating and breaking off the misbehaving nodes. To mitigate the security breaches from internal compromised nodes and eventually eliminate compromised nodes from the wireless ad hoc networks, we propose an energy efficient malicious node removal mechanism. Further, a new attack on routing service called entrap attack is introduced, where an innocent node is incriminated as a malicious node.",

However, it could also be a double-edge sword threatening mobile users privacy, e.g., location privacy, if the authenticity proofs used in message authentication were abused. In this paper, to prevent such kind of abuse, we first propose a novel efficient message authentication scheme, which can achieve not only users identity privacy but also non-transferability.

However, there exist many challenging security issues in MHSN such as how to securely identify a senior who has the same symptom, how to prevent others who don't have the symptom from knowing someone's symptom? In this paper, to tackle these challenging security issues, we propose a secure same-symptom-based handshake (SSH) scheme, and apply the provable security technique to demonstrate its security in the random oracle model.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider service-oriented mobile social networks (S-MSNs) and propose a Secure and Efficient service Review (SEER) system to enable user feedback. Each service provider independently maintains a SEER system for itself, which collects and stores user reviews about its services without requiring any central trusted authority. The service reviews can then be made available to interested users in making wise service selection decisions. We identify three unique service review attacks and then develop sophisticated security mechanisms for SEER to deal with these attacks. Specifically, SEER enables users to distributedly and cooperatively submit their reviews in an integrated chain form by using hierarchical and aggregate signature techniques. It discourages service providers to reject, modify or delete their reviews. The integrity of reviews is therefore improved. Through security analysis and performance evaluation, we show that SEER effectively resists the service review attacks and achieves significantly better performance in terms of submission rate and delay than a service review system that does not adopt user cooperation or the chain review structure.",

        "abstract": "In delay tolerant networks (DTNs), message delivery is operated in an opportunistic way through store-carry and forward relaying, and every DTN node is in anticipation of cooperation for data forwarding from others. Unfortunately, there always exist some selfish nodes that are reluctant to contribute to this cooperative data forwarding procedure so as to save their valuable storage buffer, limited computation power and precious energy. In order to stimulate nodes' willingness to participate in data forwarding, a number of incentive schemes have been proposed recently. However, most existing incentive schemes simply ignore efforts of nodes involved in message delivery if messages delivered fail to reach their destinations. Due to the nature of DTN, such as intermittent connectivity, it is not unusual to have unreliable message delivery, which results in unrewarded or wasted efforts for participating nodes and may discourage them from participating in future data forwarding. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize contribution of every node involved in a data forwarding procedure even the message it helps to forward doesn't successfully reach its destination. However, how to track all delivery paths so as to give every intermediate node some incentive for their cooperative efforts of data forwarding is still an open research problem. To address this problem, we propose a secure message forwarding scheme with path tracking. The proposed method is end-to-end secure with data source and identity authentication. In addition, it can thwart some well known attacks including edge inserting attack, sibling inserting attack and free riding attack. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

However, there exist some newly emerging privacy challenging issues in vehicle chatting application, such as how to find a like-minded vehicle on the road and how to prevent one's interest privacy (IP) from others who are not like-minded? In this paper, to tackle these challenging issues, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving finding like-minded vehicle protocol (FLIP), and apply the provable security technique to demonstrate its security.

In this paper, we propose a new roadside unit (RSU) aided bundle forwarding protocol for vehicular delay tolerant networks. Furthermore, with the assistance from those RSUs deployed at some critical points on the road, for example, intersections, the proposed protocol can increase the network performance in terms of delivery ratio. At the same time, since vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-RSU (V2R) privacy-preserving authentications are guaranteed, the black (gray) hole attacks can be avoided. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

        "abstract": "In this paper, to achieve a vehicle user's privacy preservation while improving the key update efficiency of location-based services (LBSs) in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), we propose a dynamic privacy-preserving key management scheme called DIKE. Specifically, in the proposed DIKE scheme, we first introduce a privacy-preserving authentication technique that not only provides the vehicle user's anonymous authentication but enables double-registration detection as well. We then present efficient LBS session key update procedures: 1) We divide the session of an LBS into several time slots so that each time slot holds a different session key; when no vehicle user departs from the service session, each joined user can use a one-way hash function to autonomously update the new session key for achieving forward secrecy. 2) We also integrate a novel dynamic threshold technique in traditional vehicle-to-vehicle (V-2-V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V-2-I) communications to achieve the session key's backward secrecy, i.e., when a vehicle user departs from the service session, more than a threshold number of joined users can cooperatively update the new session key. Performance evaluations via extensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed DIKE scheme in terms of low key update delay and fast key update ratio.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study user profile matching with privacy-preservation in mobile social networks (MSNs) and introduce a family of novel profile matching protocols. We first propose an explicit Comparison-based Profile Matching protocol (eCPM) which runs between two parties, an initiator and a responder. The eCPM enables the initiator to obtain the comparison-based matching result about a specified attribute in their profiles, while preventing their attribute values from disclosure. We then propose an implicit Comparison-based Profile Matching protocol (iCPM) which allows the initiator to directly obtain some messages instead of the comparison result from the responder. The messages unrelated to user profile can be divided into multiple categories by the responder. The initiator implicitly chooses the interested category which is unknown to the responder. Two messages in each category are prepared by the responder, and only one message can be obtained by the initiator according to the comparison result on a single attribute. We further generalize the iCPM to an implicit Predicate-based Profile Matching protocol (iPPM) which allows complex comparison criteria spanning multiple attributes. The anonymity analysis shows all these protocols achieve the confidentiality of user profiles. In addition, the eCPM reveals the comparison result to the initiator and provides only conditional anonymity; the iCPM and the iPPM do not reveal the result at all and provide full anonymity. We analyze the communication overhead and the anonymity strength of the protocols. We then present an enhanced version of the eCPM, called eCPM+, by combining the eCPM with a novel prediction-based adaptive pseudonym change strategy. The performance of the eCPM and the eCPM+ are comparatively studied through extensive trace-based simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the eCPM+ achieves significantly higher anonymity strength with slightly larger number of pseudonyms than the eCPM.",

        "title": "A Novel Compromise-Resilient Authentication System for Wireless Mesh Networks",
        "abstract": "User authentication is essential in service-oriented communication networks to identify and reject any unauthorized network access. The state-of-the-art practice in securing wireless networks is based on the technique of authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) framework where an AAA server is adopted to authenticate mobile users (MUs), handle authorization requests, and collect accounting data. However, the traditional AAA framework is by way of a single authentication server, and cannot tolerate AAA server failure due to various malicious attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) attack, or any other failure event such that the authentication server is compromised due to misuse, misconfiguration and malicious access, etc. Thus, a more resilient approach is to adopt multiple authentication servers, where any authentication request is handled by more than one authentication servers in order to resist any compromise event of an authentication server. To meet this design objective, we introduce a novel compromise-resilient authentication system based on (t, n) threshold signature technique. With the proposed system, only t or more out of n authentication servers can cooperatively allow a MU to have network access, and any t-1 or less cannot. Case study of reliability analysis is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system. The proposed authentication system is expected to particularly contribute to wireless mesh networking (WMN) in metropolitan areas where thousands of nodes may coexist and are managed under a single control plane such that duplicated AAA servers are necessary.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Trustworthy Service Evaluation (TSE) system to enable users to share service reviews in service-oriented mobile social networks (S-MSNs). Each service provider independently maintains a TSE for itself, which collects and stores users' reviews about its services without requiring any third trusted authority. The service reviews can then be made available to interested users in making wise service selection decisions. We identify three unique service review attacks, i.e., linkability, rejection, and modification attacks, and develop sophisticated security mechanisms for the TSE to deal with these attacks. Specifically, the basic TSE (bTSE) enables users to distributedly and cooperatively submit their reviews in an integrated chain form by using hierarchical and aggregate signature techniques. It restricts the service providers to reject, modify, or delete the reviews. Thus, the integrity and authenticity of reviews are improved. Further, we extend the bTSE to a Sybil-resisted TSE (SrTSE) to enable the detection of two typical sybil attacks. In the SrTSE, if a user generates multiple reviews toward a vendor in a predefined time slot with different pseudonyms, the real identity of that user will be revealed. Through security analysis and numerical results, we show that the bTSE and the SrTSE effectively resist the service review attacks and the SrTSE additionally detects the sybil attacks in an efficient manner. Through performance evaluation, we show that the bTSE achieves better performance in terms of submission rate and delay than a service review system that does not adopt user cooperation.",

        "abstract": "Mutual user identification is a necessary step for trust establishment among users in an unattended mobile social network (MSN). Directly exposing identity information to others unknown may cause total unfairness in identity loss when the other party of the identification process misbehaves. Using an on-line trusted third party (TTP) for user identification will cause communication and security problems, while a traditional off-line TTP solution will generate delay in fairness enforcement. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained identification protocol, which provides confidentiality, unlinkability, and real-time fairness without the involvement of TTP. In the protocol, identification is carried out by an iterative identification information exchange process, where two participating users have to disclose part of their identification information to each other in each iteration. The process terminates whenever one of them fails to do so. In this way, if a user loses part of its identification information to another user, then it must have obtained an approximately equal amount of identification information of that user. Therefore, misbehavior is discouraged, and fairness is improved. Through analysis we demonstrate that fairness can be well guaranteed as long as users strictly follow the protocol rules. Extensive simulation results further confirm that the proposed protocol can significantly reduce fairness loss in MSN environment.",

        "title": "Morality-Driven Data Forwarding With Privacy Preservation in Mobile Social Networks.",
        "abstract": "Effective data forwarding is critical for most mobile social network (MSN) applications such as content distribution and information searching. However, it could severely be interrupted or even disabled when the privacy preservation of users is applied, because users become unrecognizable to each other, and the social ties and interactions are no longer traceable to facilitate cooperative data forwarding. Therefore, how we can enable efficient user cooperation in MSNs without intruding on user privacy is a challenging issue. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing social morality, which is a fundamental social feature of human society, to MSNs and accordingly design a three-step protocol suite to achieve both privacy preservation and cooperative data forwarding. First, the developed protocol adopts a novel privacy-preserving route-based authentication scheme that notifies a user's anonymized mobility information to the public. Second, it measures the proximity of the user's mobility information to a specific packet's destination and evaluates the user's forwarding capacity for the packet. Third, using a game-theoretical approach, it determines the optimal data-forwarding strategy according to users' morality level and payoff. Using analysis and examples, we show that the developed protocol suite can effectively protect user personal information such as identity and visited locations. Last, we conduct extensive trace-based simulations and show that the proposed protocol suite is effective for efficiently exploring the user cooperation and attain near-optimal performance in data forwarding.",

        "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing engages a crowd of individuals to use their mobile devices to cooperatively collect data about social events and phenomena for special interest customers. It can reduce the cost on sensor deployment and improve data quality with human intelligence. To enhance data trustworthiness, it is critical for service provider to recruit mobile users based on their personal features, e.g., mobility pattern and reputation, but it leads to the privacy leakage of mobile users. Therefore, how to resolve the contradiction between user privacy and task allocation is challenging in mobile crowdsensing. In this paper, we propose SPOON, a strong privacy-preserving mobile crowdsensing scheme supporting accurate task allocation from geographic information and credit points of mobile users. In SPOON, the service provider enables to recruit mobile users based on their locations, and select proper sensing reports according to their trust levels without invading user privacy. By utilizing proxy re-encryption and BBS+ signature, sensing tasks are protected and reports are anonymized to prevent privacy leakage. In addition, a privacy-preserving credit management mechanism is introduced to achieve decentralized trust management and secure credit proof for mobile users. Finally, we show the security properties of SPOON and demonstrate its efficiency on computation and communication.",

Ensuring secure operation is one of the prerequisites for deploying reliable VANETs. In this article we argue that public key infrastructure is the most viable mechanism for securing VANETs as it can meet most VANET security requirements. However, PKI cannot provide certain security requirements such as location privacy, efficient authentication, and distributed and fair revocation. To complement the security services provided by PKI, we introduce complementary security mechanisms that can meet the aforementioned security requirements. Since denial of service attacks have severe consequences on network availability, which is one of the VANET security requirements, we propose a mechanism for mitigating the effect of DoS attacks in VANETs. Simulation results show that the complementary mechanisms together with PKI can efficiently secure VANETs.",

        "abstract": "The concept of smart grid has emerged as a convergence of traditional power system engineering and information and communication technology. It is vital to the success of next generation of power grid, which is expected to be featuring reliable, efficient, flexible, clean, friendly, and secure characteristics. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving aggregation scheme, named EPPA, for smart grid communications. EPPA uses a superincreasing sequence to structure multidimensional data and encrypt the structured data by the homomorphic Paillier cryptosystem technique. For data communications from user to smart grid operation center, data aggregation is performed directly on ciphertext at local gateways without decryption, and the aggregation result of the original data can be obtained at the operation center. EPPA also adopts the batch verification technique to reduce authentication cost. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that EPPA resists various security threats and preserve user privacy, and has significantly less computation and communication overhead than existing competing approaches.",

        "abstract": "It is frustrating and time consuming for drivers to find an available parking spot in a congested area, such as downtown and shopping malls, especially in peak hours. Thus, it is very helpful for drivers to have real-time parking information to assist them in finding vacant parking spots timely. Unfortunately, to acquire needed parking information, the drivers have to submit personal queries for the availability of parking spaces in their destinations, and this could result in privacy violation if the queries are not protected. To reduce drivers\u2019 hassle and preserve drivers\u2019 privacy, we propose a privacy-preserving smart parking navigation system (P-SPAN) with efficient navigation result retrieval for drivers using Bloom filters. P-SPAN enables a cloud to guide vehicles to vacant parking spaces in the destinations based on real-time parking information without disclosing any personal information about drivers. Specifically, an efficient data retrieval mechanism is developed based on Bloom filters to support navigation result retrieval for querying vehicles. The drivers can anonymously query accessible parking spots to the cloud, and efficiently retrieve the encrypted navigation results from the passing-by roadside units. Therefore, it is unnecessary for a vehicle to keep connected with the queried roadside unit for acquiring the navigation result. Performance evaluation demonstrates that P-SPAN can provide effective parking navigation with high navigation result retrieving probability and low computational and communication overhead.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving emergency call scheme, called PEC, enabling patients in life-threatening emergencies to fast and accurately transmit emergency data to the nearby helpers via mobile healthcare social networks (MHSNs). Once an emergency happens, the personal digital assistant (PDA) of the patient runs the PEC to collect the emergency data including emergency location, patient health record, as well as patient physiological condition. The PEC then generates an emergency call with the emergency data inside and epidemically disseminates it to every user in the patient's neighborhood. If a physician happens to be nearby, the PEC ensures the time used to notify the physician of the emergency is the shortest. We show via theoretical analysis that the PEC is able to provide fine-grained access control on the emergency data, where the access policy is set by patients themselves. More- over, the PEC can withstand multiple types of attacks, such as identity theft attack, forgery attack, and collusion attack. We also de- vise an effective revocation mechanism to make the revocable PEC (rPEC) resistant to inside attacks. In addition, we demonstrate via simulation that the PEC can significantly reduce the response time of emergency care in MHSNs.",

        "abstract": "Position-based routing for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks is a promising approach to reduce route overhead by using the location information of each node. However, in most of the previously reported position-based routing protocols, a node has to periodically broadcast its current position coordinates and identifiers to its one-hop neighbors. Such information could be easily eavesdropped on by an adversary if it is not protected, and consequently, location privacy would be violated. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-aware position-based routing protocol (PPBR), in which a node takes dynamic pseudo identifiers instead of its real identity in advertising its position. Furthermore, PPBR provides end-to-end anonymity to any intermediate nodes along the route. The theoretical analysis shows that the probability of tracking a node under PPBR through traffic analysis would be very small. We compare the performance of PPBR with that by GPSR and AODV through extensive simulation, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme. We also show that frequent update of the pseudo identifier of each node yields an insignificant impact on routing performance and overhead.",

In this article, we examine the architecture of mobile edge computing and explore the potential of utilizing mobile edge computing to enhance data analysis for IoT applications while achieving data security and computational efficiency. Specifically, we first introduce the overall architecture and several promising edge-assisted IoT applications. We then study the security, privacy, and efficiency challenges in data processing for mobile edge computing, and discuss the opportunities to enhance data security and improve computational efficiency with the assistance of edge computing, including secure data aggregation, secure data deduplication, and secure computational offloading.

To avoid any possible malicious attack and resource abuse, employing a digital signature scheme is widely recognized as the most effective approach for VSNs to achieve authentication, integrity, and validity. However, when the number of signatures received by a Roadside Unit (RSU) becomes large, a scalability problem emerges immediately, where the RSU could be difficult to sequentially verify each received signature within 300 ms interval according to the current Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) broadcast protocol. In this paper, we introduce an efficient batch signature verification scheme for communications between vehicles and RSUs (or termed vehicle- to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications), in which an RSU can verify multiple received signatures at the same time such that the total verification time can be dramatically reduced. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve conditional privacy preservation that is essential in VSNs, where each message launched by a vehicle is mapped to a distinct pseudo identity, while a trust authority can always retrieve the real identity of a vehicle from any pseudo identity. With the proposed scheme, since identity-based cryptography is employed in generating private keys for pseudo identities, certificates are not needed and thus transmission overhead can be significantly reduced.",

        "abstract": "Bundle Authentication is a critical security service in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) that ensures authenticity and integrity of bundles during multi-hop transmissions. Public key signatures, which have been suggested in existing bundle security protocol specification, achieve bundle authentication at the cost of an increased computational, transmission overhead and a higher energy consumption, which is not desirable for energy-constrained DTNs. On the other hand, the unique ``store-carry-and-forward'' transmission characteristic of DTNs implies that bundles from distinct/common senders can be buffered opportunistically at some common intermediate nodes. This ``buffering'' characteristic distinguishes DTN from any other traditional wireless networks, for which an intermediate cache is not supported. To exploit such a buffering characteristic, in this paper, we propose an Opportunistic Batch Bundle Authentication Scheme (OBBA) to achieve efficient bundle authentication. The proposed scheme adopts batch verification techniques, allowing a computational overhead to be bounded by the number of opportunistic contacts instead of the number of messages. Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept of a fragment authentication tree to minimize communication cost by choosing an optimal tree height. Finally, we implement OBBA in a specific DTN scenario setting: packet-switched networks on campus. The simulation results in terms of computation time, transmission overhead and power consumption are given to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed schemes.",

        "abstract": "Location privacy is one of the Quality of Privacies (QoP) in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and imperative for the VANET's full flourish. Frequent pseudonym changing can provide a promising solution to achieve location privacy, however if the pseudonyms are changed in an improper occasion, the solution is ineffective. In this paper, to improve the effectiveness of this kind of solution, we first introduce the social spot where many vehicles could aggregate, e.g., a road intersection when the traffic light is red or a free parking lot near a shopping mall. We then propose a social spot based pseudonyms changing technique to achieve the location privacy. By taking the anonymity set size as the privacy metric, we develop two anonymity analytic models to quantitatively investigate the location privacy achieved in the technique. The analytical results show that better location privacy can be achieved when a vehicle changes its pseudonyms at some highly social spots, and as a result, the proposed models can be used to assist vehicles to change their pseudonyms for better location privacy at the right moment and place.",

        "abstract": "Without direct path, information delivery in sparse delay tolerant networks (DTNs) typically relies on intermittent relays, making the transmission not only unreliable but also time consuming. To make the matter even worse, the source nodes may transmit some encrypted \u201cjunk\u201d information, similar as the spam emails in current mail systems, to the destinations; without effective control, the delivery of encrypted junk information would significantly consume the precious resource of DTN and accordingly throttle the network efficiency. To address this challenging issue, we propose PReFilter, an efficient privacy-preserving relay filter scheme to prevent the relay of encrypted junk information early in DTNs. In PReFilter, each node maintains a specific filtering policy based on its interests, and distributes this policy to a group of \u201cfriends\u201d in the network in advance. By applying the filtering policy, the friends can filter the junk packets which are heading to the node during the relay. Note that the keywords in the filtering policy may disclose the node's interest/preference to some extent, harming the privacy of nodes, a privacy-preserving filtering policy distribution technique is introduced, which will keep the sensitive keywords secret in the filtering policy. Through detailed security analysis, we demonstrate that PReFilter can prevent strong privacy-curious adversaries from learning the filtering keywords, and discourage a weak privacy-curious friend to guess the filtering keywords from the filtering policy. In addition, with extensive simulations, we show that PReFilter is not only effective in the filtering of junk packets but also significantly improve the network performance with the dramatically reduced delivery cost due to the junk packets.",

Emerging applications of DTN include rural DTN, vehicular DTN and pocket DTN. The development of DTN raises a number of security-related challenges due to inconsistent network access and unreliable end-to-end network path. One of the challenges is initial secure context establishment as it is unrealistic to assume that public key infrastructure (PKI) is always globally present and available, hence, the public key management becomes an open problem for DTN. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a dynamic virtual digraph (DVD) model for public key distribution study by extending graph theory and then present a public key distribution scheme for pocket DTN based on two-channel cryptography. By distinguishing between owners and carriers, public key exchange and authentication issues in the decentralized pocket DTN environment can be solved by a two-channel cryptography process and our simulation results have proven it.",

Due to the special infrastructure and communication mode, intrusion detection in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) is especially challenging and requires particular design considerations. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme, called RADAR, to detect anomalous mesh nodes in WMNs. Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior. Our current scheme is specified and implemented with a reactive routing protocol, aiming at detecting malicious mesh nodes which intentionally violate normal routing mechanisms. The simulation results show that our scheme performs well in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, computational overhead, and scalability.",

        "abstract": "Injecting false data attack is a well known serious threat to wireless sensor network, for which an adversary reports bogus information to sink causing error decision at upper level and energy waste in en-route nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel bandwidth-efficient cooperative authentication (BECAN) scheme for filtering injected false data. Based on the random graph characteristics of sensor node deployment and the cooperative bit-compressed authentication technique, the proposed BECAN scheme can save energy by early detecting and filtering the majority of injected false data with minor extra overheads at the en-route nodes. In addition, only a very small fraction of injected false data needs to be checked by the sink, which thus largely reduces the burden of the sink. Both theoretical and simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of high filtering probability and energy saving.",

It can be integrated with a specific routing protocol to improve the latter's reliability and prevent data injection attacks during data communication. In PSR, using past link quality measurements, each node predicts the quality of every incidental link, and thus any change in the neighbor set as well, for the immediate future. When there are multiple possible next hops for packet forwarding (according to the routing protocol used), PSR selects the one with the highest predicted link quality among them. Specially-tailored lightweight source and data authentication methods are employed by nodes to secure data communication. Further, each node adaptively enables or disables source authentication according to predicted neighbor set change and prediction accuracy so as to quickly filter false source authentication requests. We demonstrate that PSR significantly increases routing reliability and effectively resists data injection attacks through in-depth security analysis and extensive simulation study.",

In this paper, we propose a security-enhanced data aggregation scheme for smart grid communications based on homomorphic cryptosystem, trapdoor hash functions and homomorphic authenticators. Our scheme can achieve data confidentiality and integrity against the malicious aggregator (e.g. gateway), meaning that the aggregator is not able to access usersu0027 private information or corrupt the power consumption reports during the aggregation process. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that our scheme can resist potential threats and be proved secure under cryptographic hard assumptions.

Nevertheless, how to allocate these tasks to proper mobile users and improve communication efficiency are critical in spatial crowdsourcing. In this paper, we propose Fo-DSC, a fog-based deduplicated spatial crowdsourcing framework to achieve precise task allocation and secure data deduplication. Specifically, by integrating fog computing, we design a two-step task allocation mechanism to improve the accuracy of tasks allocation in spatial crowdsourcing. The fog nodes can detect and erase the repeated data in crowdsensing reports without learning any information about the reports. Furthermore, Fo-DSC efficiently records the contributions of mobile users whose data are reduplicated and deleted. As a result, these users do not become discouraged. Finally, we demonstrate that Fo-DSC satisfies the properties of fog-based task allocation and secure data deduplication with low computational and communication overheads.",

Real-time traffic information exchange can avoid vehicles being congested on roads. However, when the drivers are acquiring the traffic information, their privacy is inevitable to be disclosed. To preserve the driveru0027s privacy, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving real-time navigation system (PRIN) using vehicular crowdsourcing. In PRIN, the RSUs cooperatively find an optimal path for the querying vehicle to the destination according to the real-time traffic information crowdsourced by the vehicles in their coverage areas. The querying vehicle retrieves the navigation result from each RSU successively when entering its coverage area, and follows the proper driving route to the next RSU, until reaching its destination. During these querying, crowdsourcing and retrieving processes, the driveru0027s personal information, such as location, identity, is protected from being disclosed to attackers. In addition, a trusted authority can trace the driversu0027 identities if they upload false traffic information. Finally, we discuss the properties of conditional privacy preservation and demonstrate the efficiency of PRIN.",

Thus, the data server only manages the employeesu0027 identities, instead of all mobile devices of employees, such that the overhead of mobile devices management for corporations is reduced. In addition, the data server is able to trace a lost or stolen device when it authenticates to the data server. Finally, we evaluate the computational and communication overheads to demonstrate the efficiency of Dtaka.",

        "abstract": "Finding a vacant parking space in a congested area, such as shopping mall, airport, etc., is always time-consuming and frustrating for drivers. Real-time parking information can avoid vehicles being cruising on the roads. However, when the drivers are acquiring parking information, their privacy is inevitable to be disclosed. In this paper, to minimize drivers\u2019 hassle and preserve drivers\u2019 privacy, we propose CPARN, a Cloud-based Privacy-preserving pARking Navigation system through vehicular communications, in which a cloud server guides drivers to vacant parking spaces close to their desired destinations without exposing the privacy of drivers, including drivers\u2019 identities, references and routes. Specifically, CPARN allows drivers to query vacant parking spaces in an anonymous manner to a cloud server that maintains the parking information, and retrieve the protected navigation responses from the roadside units when the vehicles are passing through. CPARN has the advantage that it is unnecessary for a vehicle to keep connected with the queried roadside unit to ensure the retrievability of the navigation result, such that the navigation retrieving probability can be significantly improved. Performance evaluation through extensive simulations demonstrates the efficiency and practicality of CPARN.",

        "abstract": "Smart grid enables two-way communications between operation centers and smart meters to collect power consumption and achieve demand response to improve flexibility, reliability, and efficiency of electricity system. However, power consumption data may contain users\u2019 privacy, e.g., activities, references, and habits. Many smart metering schemes have been proposed utilizing homomorphic encryption for users\u2019 privacy preservation. Unfortunately, some abnormality of smart meter reading, e.g., caused by electricity theft, cannot be discovered since data is encrypted. Meanwhile, operation centers could become curious in reality. To address the above issues, we propose a new privacy-preserving smart metering scheme for smart grid, which supports data aggregation, differential privacy, fault tolerance, and range-based filtering simultaneously. Specifically, we extend lifted ElGamal encryption to aggregate users\u2019 consumption reports at the gateway to reduce communication overhead, while supporting fault tolerance of malfunctioning smart meters effectively. We also leverage zero-knowledge range proof to filter abnormal measurements caused by electricity theft or false data injection attacks without exposing individual measurements. In addition, our scheme can resist differential attacks, by which the curious operation center can violate users\u2019 privacy through comparing two aggregations of the similar data set. Finally, we discuss the properties of the proposed scheme and evaluate its performance in terms of security and efficiency.",

It removes the necessity of sensors deployment and hence supports large-scale sensing applications efficiently. Nevertheless, incentive and privacy remain as the major obstacles that need additional attention. If privacy is not presered or no benefit obtains, no mobile user prefers to participate in crowdsensing activities. In this paper, we propose DARD, a dual-anonymous reward distribution scheme to achieve the incentive for mobile users and privacy protection for both customers and mobile users in mobile crowdsensing. Specifically, we design a reward sharing incentive mechanism to encourage mobile users to participate in tasks and employ randomizable techniques to protect the identities of customers and mobile users during reward claim, distribution and deposit. Our analysis further shows that DARD achieves reward balance and cheater detection with low computational and communication overhead.",

        "abstract": "Vehicular communications enable a variety of applications to improve road safety, driving experience, and traffic management. Many of these applications require data to be routed through multiple hops until they reach to the destination. Unfortunately, due to highly dynamic driving patterns of vehicles, it is challenging to achieve effective and time-sensitive data forwarding in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Both social- based and trajectory-assisted data forwarding strategies have been proposed to improve packet delivery performance in VANETs. The former reaches limited data delivery ratio and the latter leaks location privacy of drivers. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving data forwarding protocol based on personal-social behaviors of drivers to achieve highly reliable transmissions and privacy preservation for drivers in VANETs. Specifically, by observing the phenomenon that vehicles regularly visit some social spots, such as shopping malls, museums and busy intersections, we can obtain the personal-social behaviors of drivers. Based on these behaviors, the messages can be delivered to roadside units (RSUs) at the social spots frequently visited by vehicles. Later, once a vehicle visits the social spots, it can successfully retrieve the messages destined for it from the RSUs anonymously. In addition, the identities of senders are conditionally preserved and the personal-social behaviors of drivers are protected against a global adversary. Performance evaluation demonstrates its efficiency in terms of high delivery ratio and low average delay.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) assisted proximity marketing is one of the most promising V2X services due to its huge potential, and has attracted a lot of research efforts recently. In proximity marketing, roadside merchants rely on third-party ad networks to target their advertisements to nearby vehicles or pedestrians with related interests, and pay ad networks according to some pricing mechanisms, such as cost per-view. It is therefore important for merchants to learn ad conversion rate (how much of their revenue can be attributed to proximity marketing) such that merchants can adjust their advertising strategy. For ad conversion, two-party private set intersection (PSI) technique has been widely adopted, where ad networks and merchants can jointly compute ad conversion rate without leaking sensitive customer information. However, state-of-art literature on PSI either assumes the involved two parties honestly follow the protocol or only tolerates limited adversarial behaviors. In this paper, we first design a novel and efficient PSI scheme that is secure in the presence of malicious adversaries, where two parties can arbitrarily deviate from the scheme. By integrating an efficient input certification mechanism into the designed PSI scheme, we propose a privacy-preserving ad conversion protocol for V2X-assisted proximity marketing, that can achieve input privacy, unlinkability, unforgeability, and output verifiability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed ad conversion protocol is secure under cryptographic assumptions. Finally, we show that the proposed ad conversion protocol outperforms the state-of-art approaches when considering both security strength and computation complexity.",

        "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing enables a crowd of individuals to cooperatively collect data for special interest customers using their mobile devices. The success of mobile crowdsensing largely depends on the participating mobile users. The broader participation, the more sensing data are collected; nevertheless, the more replicate data may be generated, thereby bringing unnecessary heavy communication overhead. Hence it is critical to eliminate duplicate data to improve communication efficiency, a.k.a., data deduplication. Unfortunately, sensing data is usually protected, making its deduplication challenging. In this paper, we propose a fog-assisted mobile crowdsensing framework, enabling fog nodes to allocate tasks based on user mobility for improving the accuracy of task assignment. Further, a fog-assisted secure data deduplication scheme (Fo-SDD) is introduced to improve communication efficiency while guaranteeing data confidentiality. Specifically, a BLS-oblivious pseudo-random function is designed to enable fog nodes to detect and remove replicate data in sensing reports without exposing the content of reports. To protect the privacy of mobile users, we further extend the Fo-SDD to hide usersu0027 identities during data collection. In doing so, Chameleon hash function is leveraged to achieve contribution claim and reward retrieval for anonymous mobile users. Finally, we demonstrate that both schemes achieve secure, efficient data deduplication.",

On the other hand, it triggers serious risks on vehicle theft and location privacy leakage. To address these issues, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving automated valet parking protocol for self-driving vehicles. The proposed protocol is characterized by extending anonymous authentication to support two-factor authentication with mutual traceability for reducing the risks of vehicle theft and preventing the privacy leakage of users in automated valet parking. Specifically, based on one-time password and secure mobile devices, two-factor authentication is achieved between vehicles and smartphones to ensure vehicle security in remote pickup. By exploiting the BBS+ signature and the Cuckoo filter, user location privacy is protected against the curious parking lots and service providers. In addition, the traceable tags are designed to enable a trusted authority to identify the vehicles and users for localizing a stolen or missing vehicle and preventing the slandering of greedy users. Finally, formal security analysis on the proposed protocol is given to show that the authentication, anonymity, and traceability can be reduced to standard hard assumptions, and performance evaluation demonstrates the proposed protocol is efficient and practical to be implemented in autonomous driving era.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a degradation-of-QoS (DeQoS) attack against vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Through DeQoS, the attacker can relay the authentication exchanges between roadside units (RSUs) and faraway vehicles to establish connections but will not relay the service afterwards, which wastes the limited connection resources of RSUs. With enough number of dummy connections, RSUs\u2019 resources could run out such that they can no longer provide services for legitimate vehicles. Since the mobility of vehicles is highly related to the success probability of the attacker, we model the arrival and departure of vehicles into an \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M/M/N$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-queue system and show how the attacker can adaptively choose different attack strategies to perform the attack in distinct traffic environments. A series of simulations are conducted to verify the practicality of the attack using MATLAB. The experimental results demonstrate that the attacker can easily find exploitable vehicles and launch the DeQoS attack with an overwhelming probability (e.g., more than 0.98). As DeQoS exploits the weakness of lacking physical proximity authentication, only employing existing application-layer defense protocols in VANETs such as cryptography-based protocols cannot prevent this attack. Therefore, we design a new cross-layer relay-resistant authentication protocol by leveraging the distance-bounding technique. Security analysis is given to show that the defense mechanism can effectively mitigate DeQoS.",

In reality, security in vehicular cloud computing lies in the willingness of vehicle owners who are concerned with their vehiclesu0027 protection from various threats. Increasing the participation of vehicles will improve the security in vehicular cloud computing as a whole. Therefore, for a CVCC service provider, it is very critical to encourage vehicle owners to invest in their own security for achieving deeper security of CVCC systems. In this article, we first present a CVCC architecture and its applications. Then we study several security issues in vehicular cloud computing. Afterward, we model a CVCC network by a two-phase heterogeneous public good game, and then investigate the influence of different incentive mechanisms and the structure of a complex network describing the vehiclesu0027 connectivity on the vehiclesu0027 investment rate. Finally, we present our conclusion.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient, secure and privacy-preserving scheme for smart grid downlink communication. Specifically, we propose an efficient identity based signcryption scheme, called EIBSC, providing privacy preservation in downlink communication for smart grids. The proposed scheme is characterized by employing the concealing destination technique on a tree network topology to protect consumer privacy in downlink communication. Moreover, the proposed scheme employs identity based signcryption to efficiently achieve downlink message source authentication, data integrity and encryption. Additionally, compared to other identity-based signcryption schemes, the proposed scheme is more efficient in regards to computational overhead and ciphertext size. Furthermore, our security analysis illustrates that the proposed scheme is resilient against various security threats to smart grids.",

        "abstract": "Distributed energy resources (ERs), featured with small-scale power generation technologies and renewable energy sources, are considered as necessary supplements for smart grid. To ensure that merged resources contribute effectively to the grid, data generated by consumer side should be shared among the ERs. However, it also introduces challenges of the protection of consumer privacy. To address these difficulties, we propose a new framework to share data in smart grid by leveraging new advances in homomorphic encryption and proxy re-encryption. Our proposed framework allows ERs to analyze consumer data while ensuring consumer privacy. An additional benefit of our proposed framework is that consumer data is transmitted over the smart grid only once. Furthermore, we present a concrete scheme falling into the proposed framework. Extensive analysis shows that the concrete scheme is secure and efficient.",

        "abstract": "Key agreement is paramount in secure wireless communications. A promising approach to address key agreement schemes is to extract secure keys from channel characteristics. However, because channels lack randomness, it is difficult for wireless networks with stationary communicating terminals to generate robust keys. In this paper, we propose a Robust Secure Key Agreement (RSKA) scheme from Received Signal Strength (RSS) in stationary wireless networks. In order to mitigate the asymmetry in RSS measurements for communicating parties, the sender and receiver normalize RSS measurements and quantize them into q-bit sequences. They then reshape bit sequences into new l-bit sequences. These bit sequences work as key sources. Rather than extracting the key from the key sources directly, the sender randomly generates a bit sequence as a key and hides it in a promise. This is created from a polynomial constructed on the sender\u2019s key source and key. The receiver recovers the key by reconstructing a polynomial from its key source and the promise. Our analysis shows that the shared key generated by our proposed RSKA scheme has features of high randomness and a high bit rate compared to traditional RSS-based key agreement schemes.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of technology, healthcare systems have been quickly transformed into a pervasive environment, where both challenges and opportunities abound. On the one hand, the proliferation of smart phones and advances in medical sensors and devices have driven the emergence of wireless body area networks for remote patient monitoring, also known as mobile-health (M-health), thereby providing a reliable and cost effective way to improving efficiency and quality of health care. On the other hand, the advances of M-health systems also generate extensive medical data, which could crowd today\u2019s cellular networks. Device-to-device (D2D) communications have been proposed to address this challenge, but unfortunately, security threats are also emerging because of the open nature of D2D communications between medical sensors and highly privacy-sensitive nature of medical data. Even, more disconcerting is healthcare systems that have many characteristics that make them more vulnerable to privacy attacks than in other applications. In this paper, we propose a light-weight and robust security-aware D2D-assist data transmission protocol for M-health systems by using a certificateless generalized signcryption (CLGSC) technique. Specifically, we first propose a new efficient CLGSC scheme, which can adaptively work as one of the three cryptographic primitives: signcryption, signature, or encryption, but within one single algorithm. The scheme is proved to be secure, simultaneously achieving confidentiality and unforgeability. Based on the proposed CLGSC algorithm, we further design a D2D-assist data transmission protocol for M-health systems with security properties, including data confidentiality and integrity, mutual authentication, contextual privacy, anonymity, unlinkability, and forward security. Performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can achieve the design objectives and outperform existing schemes in terms of computational and communication overhead.",

Users must provide their health information to insurance companies for their applications. This introduces potential threats to user privacy. In this paper, we propose the fairness-aware and privacy-preserving (FAPP) protocol for online health insurance systems. In the FAPP protocol, a useru0027s health condition is encapsulated into a ciphertext with random numbers and sent to the health insurance company. The company will be unable to access the plaintext without prior user permission. However, the company will still be able to verify user integrity based on the ciphertext. In contrast to current health insurance schemes where insurance quotes are calculated by the company, the quote is calculated by the user based on the companyu0027s public policy in the proposed FAPP protocol. Additionally, the company is able to determine whether users have cheated when generating quotes. Furthermore, we propose a concept of privacy-preserving quote, which ensures that user health details cannot be derived from a generated quote. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed FAPP protocol can achieve privacy-preservation and transparency.",

        "abstract": "In the recent past, great attention has been directed toward road surface condition monitoring. As a matter of fact, this activity is of critical importance in transportation infrastructure management. In response, multiple solutions have been proposed which make use of mobile sensing, more specifically contemporary applications and architectures that are used in both crowdsensing and vehicle-based sensing. This has allowed for automated control as well as analysis of road surface quality. These innovations have thus encouraged and showed the importance of cloud to provide reliable transport services to clients. Nonetheless, these initiatives have not been without challenges that range from mobility support, locational awareness, low latency, as well as geo-distribution. As a result, a new term has been coined for this novel paradigm, called, fog computing. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol for enhancing security in vehicular crowdsensing-based road surface condition monitoring system using fog computing. At the onset, this paper proposes a certificateless aggregate signcryption scheme that is highly efficient. On the basis of the proposed scheme, a data transmission protocol for monitoring road surface conditions is designed with security aspects such as information confidentiality, mutual authenticity, integrity, privacy, as well as anonymity. In analyzing the system, the ability of the proposed protocol to achieve the set objectives and exercise higher efficiency with respect to computational and communication abilities in comparison to existing systems is also considered.",

To make such computational services reliable and secure, the computation results from the vehicular cloud (VC) should be verifiable and the trustworthy vehicles need to be selected to form the VC with disclosure-minimizing privacy. To address these challenges, a privacy-preserving trust-based verifiable vehicular cloud computing scheme has been proposed in this paper, named PTVC. Specifically, the proposed PTVC scheme integrates the unique features of VCC and the requirements of privacy into traditional reputation system based on beta distribution, which can help differentiate the trust levels of the vehicles and preserve location privacy in the meantime. Moreover, by using the verifiable techniques, the cloud users can verify the correctness of outsourced computation while guaranteeing the privacy of their outsourced data. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed PTVC scheme is secure and robust against several sophisticated attacks. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations are also conducted, demonstrating its effectiveness.",

In recent years, blockchain has been proposed to be a promising solution to achieve personal health information (PHI) sharing with security and privacy preservation due to its advantages of immutability. This work proposes a blockchain-based secure and privacy-preserving PHI sharing (BSPP) scheme for diagnosis improvements in e-Health systems. Firstly, two kinds of blockchains, private blockchain and consortium blockchain, are constructed by devising their data structures, and consensus mechanisms. The private blockchain is responsible for storing the PHI while the consortium blockchain keeps records of the secure indexes of the PHI. In order to achieve data security, access control, privacy preservation and secure search, all the data including the PHI, keywords and the patients' identity are public key encrypted with keyword search. Furthermore, the block generators are required to provide proof of conformance for adding new blocks to the blockchains, which guarantees the system availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can meet with the security goals. Furthermor, we implement the proposed scheme on JUICE to evaluate the performance.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous networking (HetNet) is a promising solution to meet the ever increasing demands of wireless applications. However, it is a significant challenge for mobile network operators to deploy HetNet at a large scale. To address this issue, this article discusses a new paradigm in which potential partners are encouraged to participate in facilitating HetNet deployment. This idea is inspired by the emerging phenomenon of crowdsourcing; hence, for HetNet with the feature of crowdsourcing, we have coined the term CHetNet. In this article, we discuss the essential elements of CHetNet, and propose a basic working framework. Four possible application scenarios are discussed to demonstrate how MNOs and their partners collaborate with each other to deliver wireless services. A case study is provided to illustrate that a win-win situation can be achieved by the proposed CHetNet.",

        "abstract": "Recently, concolic execution has become a hotspot in the domain of software testing\n         and program analysis. However, a practical challenge, called path divergence, impairs\n         the soundness and completeness of concolic execution. A path divergence indicates\n         the tested program runs an unpredicted path. In this work, we carry out a comprehensive\n         empirical study on path divergences using an open\u2010source concolic execution tool,\n         named CREST. To make the investigation representative, we select 120 test units randomly\n         from 21 different open\u2010source programs. The results are interesting, and will provide\n         insight to solve the challenging path\u2010divergence problem. First, about one\u2010half of\n         test units suffer from path divergences, indicating path divergences are so prevalent\n         that the issue is worthy of great attention. Second, quite a number of generated test\n         inputs drive test units to take divergent paths. This means testers need considerable\n         effort to eliminate the misleading test inputs before aggregating them to a test suite.\n         Third, we dig out ten divergent patterns through manual analysis of each path divergence.\n         Among them, the three most prevalent ones, which are exceptions, external calls, and\n         type casts, lead to almost 82% of path divergences. Finally, we discuss several countermeasures\n         to overcome path divergences. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n      ",

        "abstract": "One-way Function Tree (OFT) is a promising scheme for group key management. However, it has been found vulnerable to collusion attacks. Malicious users can collaborate to break forward and backward secrecy. Solutions have been proposed to prevent collusion attacks on OFT scheme. In this paper, we first demonstrate how existing solutions only partially consider collusion attacks. Current models surmise scenarios where malicious users may obtain node secrets unknown through collusion. They do not, however, consider that malicious users can decrypt extra blinded node secrets using known node secrets. As a result, the malicious users can collude to obtain far more information than expected. We use theoretical evidence to identify the exact node secrets which can be obtain by malicious users. Finally, we propose two improved schemes named repeated one-way function tree (ROFT) and node one-way function tree (NOFT). Compared to previous solutions, ROFT and NOFT require less adjustments to make the OFT scheme resilient to collusion attacks. Performance analysis shows that ROFT and NOFT do not incur extra communication overhead compared to the original OFT scheme. The proposed ROFT and NOFT schemes effectively solve the security problem of the OFT scheme at the cost of a minimal increase in computational cost and storage overhead.",

The proposed protocol holds the following properties: (a) it allows vehicles to broadcast messages with an authenticated while anonymous way; (b) it allows vehicles to accept the received broadcasted messages from others according to their own policies; (c) it allows the trusted third party to reveal the identity information of the vehicle who broadcasted a false message before with constant cost. Due to the above properties, our proposal helps improve the security and performance as compared to the existing authentication protocols for VANETs.",

        "abstract": "With the evolving of ehealthcare industry, electronic health records (EHRs), as one of the digital health records stored and managed by patients, have been regarded to provide more benefits. With the EHRs, patients can conveniently share health records with doctors and build up a complete picture of their health. However, due to the sensitivity of EHRs, how to guarantee the security and privacy of EHRs becomes one of the most important issues concerned by patients. To tackle these privacy challenges such as how to make a fine-grained access control on the shared EHRs, how to keep the confidentiality of EHRs stored in cloud, how to audit EHRs and how to find the suitable doctors for patients, in this paper, we propose a fine-grained EHRs sharing scheme via similarity-based recommendation accelerated by Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in cloud-assisted ehealthcare system, called FSSR. Specifically, our proposed scheme allows patients to securely share their EHRs with some suitable doctors under fine-grained privacy access control. Detailed security analysis confirms its security prosperities. In addition, extensive simulations by developing a prototype of FSSR are also conducted, and the performance evaluations demonstrate the FSSR's effectiveness in terms of computational cost, storage and communication cost while minimizing the privacy disclosure.",

        "abstract": "With the ubiquity of mobile devices, location-based social networking applications have been widely used in peopleu0027s daily life. However, due to the importance and sensitivity of location information, these applications may lead to serious security issues for useru0027s location privacy. To handle these location privacy challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving proximity testing scheme, called EPPD, for location-based services. With EPPD, a group of users can test whether they are within a given distance with minimal privacy disclosure. In specific, EPPD is comprised of two phases: first, users periodically upload their encrypted locations to service provider; and later, users can send requests to service provider for proximity testing and obtain the final testing results. Detailed security analysis shows that EPPD can achieve privacy-preserving proximity testing. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations also demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of EPPD in term of low computational cost and communication overhead.",

        "abstract": "Proxy re-encryption is a public key encryption technique that allows a proxy to perform re-encryption without exposing the corresponding plaintext. As a result, proxy re-encryption has increased utility, and can be used in a number of fields including cloud computing. In previous proxy re-encryption schemes, a proxy is assumed to follow the protocol explicitly. However, this is far from the norm, and the assumption is not always true, especially in cloud computing where public cloud is considered untrusted. In this paper, we investigate the verifiability of the re-encryption process. Specifically, we first formalize the proxy re-encryption with delegatable verifiability and its corresponding security model. Then, we propose the first proxy re-encryption scheme with delegatable verifiability. Finally, security proofs of the proposal are also formally given in the proposed security models.",

Due to this special property, bidirectional proxy re-encryption has become a flexible tool in many dynamic environments, such as cryptographic cloud storage. Nonetheless, how to design a secure and efficient bidirectional proxy re-encryption is still challenging. In this paper, we propose a new bidirectional proxy re-encryption scheme that holds the following properties: (1) constant ciphertext size no matter how many times the transformation is performed; (2) master secret security in the random oracle model, i.e., Alice (resp. Bob) colluding with the proxy cannot obtain Bob's (resp. Alice's) private key; (3) replayable chosen ciphertext (RCCA) security in the random oracle model. The above three properties are usually required in the cryptographic cloud storage. Furthermore, the proposed new master secret security may be of independent interest, as it is closer to the original desire: delegate the decryption rights while keeping the signing rights.",

        "abstract": "E-health data release, which answers the statistical queries of the Electronic Health Records (EHRs), has been widely adopted in modern health care services. However, since the EHRs contain sensitive information of the patients, the data release procedure may lead to the leakage of the privacy of patients if it is done without necessary protection measures in place. On addressing this, existing research literature introduces differential privacy to provide the necessary privacy guarantee. However, it is not suitable in sensitive e-health environments because it lacks the efficiency for data processing and updating. In this paper, we propose an efficient e-health data release scheme with consistency guarantee under differential privacy. Specifically, we improve the performance of the previous work by designing a new private partition algorithm of histogram and also proposing a heuristic hierarchical query method. We conduct real experiments and compare our scheme with the existing one to show that the proposal is more efficient in terms of data processing and updating. Moreover, we increase the accuracy of data release through consistency and give proof of privacy to show that the proposed algorithm is under \u03f5-differential privacy.",

        "abstract": "DNA similarity search has proven to be an essential demand in human genomic researches. Since DNA sequences contain many sensitive personal information, the acquisition and dissemination of DNA data have been tightly controlled and restricted by authorities. Although the problem of private DNA similarity query has been an active research issue, the latest research findings are still inadequate in terms of security, functionality and efficiency. In this paper, we propose an Efficient DNA Similarity Search scheme (EDSS) which can achieve fine-grained query and data access control over encrypted cloud data. Our original contributions are fourfold. First, we creatively put forward a private edit distance approximation algorithm to realize the efficient and high accurate DNA similarity query. Second, we classify the whole DNA sequences and design a multiple genes search strategy to achieve complicated logic query such as mixed \u201cAND\u201d and \u201cNO\u201d operations on genes. Third, the proposed scheme can also efficiently support data access control by employing a novel polynomial based design. Finally, security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the high security and efficiency of EDSS compared with existing schemes.",

        "abstract": "Range search of spatial data, has been applied in many scenarios such as geometric queries, location-based services, and computational geometry, etc. Due to the increasing amount of spatial data, which are usually outsourced to the cloud for saving storage and computational overhead. However, a common privacy issue is that the cloud server may steal useru0027s sensitive information utilizing its powerful computing advantages. A feasible way of managing this bottleneck is to encrypt spatial data before outsourcing it. Nevertheless, the availability of data will be significantly reduced because of the query difficulty over the encrypted cloud data. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Range Search scheme (EFRS) which can achieve fine- grained query over encrypted spatial data. We original contributions are threefold. First, polynomial fitting technique and orderpreserving encryption are introduced to realize the efficient and fine- grained range query over encrypted cloud data. Then, in order to improve the search efficiency, we exploit the Rtree to significantly decreased the search space. Finally, we theoretically proved the security of our proposed scheme in terms of confidentially of spatial data, privacy protection of index and trapdoor, and the unlinkability of trapdoor. Besides, extensive experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of our proposed model compared with existing schemes.",

Meanwhile, with explosive growth of data volume, users are increasingly inclining to store data on the cloud for saving local storage and computational cost. However, a long-standing problem is that the user\u2019s data may be completely revealed to the cloud server because it has full data access right. To cope with this problem, a frequently-used method is to encrypt raw data before outsourcing them, but the availability and operability of data will be reduced significantly. In this paper, we propose an efficient and geometric range query scheme (EGRQ) supporting searching and data access control over encrypted spatial data. We employ secure KNN computation, polynomial fitting technique, and order-preserving encryption to achieve secure, efficient, and accurate geometric range query over cloud data. Then, we propose a novel spatial data access control strategy to refine user\u2019s rights in our EGRQ. To improve the efficiency, R-tree is adopted to reduce the searching space and matching times in whole search process.

As the key mission of most IoT applications, data management, especially the fundamental function-data query, has long been plagued by severe security and privacy problems. Most query service providers, including the big ones (e.g., Google, Facebook, Amazon, and so on) are suffering from intensive attacks launched by insiders or outsiders. As a consequence, processing various queries in IoT without compromising the data and query privacy is an urgent and challenging issue. In this article, we propose a thing-fog-cloud architecture for secure query processing based on well studied classical paradigms. Following with a description of crucial technical challenges in terms of functionality, privacy and efficiency assurance, we survey the latest milestone-like approaches, and provide an insight into the advantages and limitations of each scheme.

Blockchain's numerous desirable properties, such as cryptographical security, decentralized nature and unalterable transaction record, make it a suitable tool to implement a decentralized PKI. However, the latest research findings about blockchain-based PKI are still incompatible with the thin-clients which have limited storage ability to download the entire blockchain.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can provide authentication service to IoT devices which is a crucial element to the security of IoT. However, the conventional PKIs are organized as a tree-like centralized structure which has demonstrated serious usability and security shortcomings such as the single point of failure. Blockchain has numerous desirable properties, such as decentralized nature, cryptographic technology and unalterable transaction record, these properties make it a potential tool to build a decentralized blockchain-based PKI. Nevertheless, the latest proposals for blockchain-based PKI did not take thin-clients into consideration where thin-clients indicate those users who cannot download the entire blockchain due to the limited storage capacity of their equipment (most IoT devices fall into this category). To settle this problem, we firstly present a Privacy-preserving Thin-client Authentication Scheme (PTAS) employing the idea of private information retrieval (PIR), which enables thin-clients to run normally like full node users and protect their privacy simultaneously. Furthermore, in order to enhance security, we further propose a (   m   -1)-private PTAS which means thin-client\u2019s information can be protected against a collusion of at most (   m   -1) full node users. Besides, security analysis and functional comparison are performed to demonstrate high security and comprehensive functionality of our schemes. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to compare computational overhead and communication overhead of PTAS and (   m   -1)-private PTAS.",

Specifically, Eve impairs the normal channel estimation by sending identical pilot sequences with the legitimate users. Based on the impaired channel estimation, the base station adopts linear processing schemes for uplink data reception, which is jammed by Eve, and downlink confidential information transmission. We first evaluate the impact of the PSA on the achievable rate with linear processing, and then propose a double channel training based scheme to combat PSA. By using the channel estimation difference in two training phases, the presence of the PSA can be detected and accurate legitimate channel estimation can be obtained by removing the effect of Eve's channel. Furthermore, we analyze the channel estimation errors and derive a closed-form expression of the minimum mean square error precoding scheme to maximize the minimum achievable secrecy rate, which outperforms the conventional linear precoding counterparts.",

Although several parallel approaches have been proposed to accelerate concolic execution, they neither scale well nor properly handle resource fluctuations and node failures, which often happen in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named PACCI, which parallelizes concolic execution and adapts to the drastic changes of computing resources by leveraging cloud infrastructures. PACCI tailors concolic execution to the MapReduce programming model and takes into account the features of cloud infrastructures. In particular, we tackle several challenging issues, such as making the exploration of different program paths independently and constructing an extensible path exploration module to support the prioritization of test inputs from a global perspective. Preliminary experimental results show that PACCI is scalable (e.g., gaining about 20\u00d7 speedup using 24 nodes) and its efficiency declines slightly about 5% and 6.1% under resource fluctuations and node failures, respectively.",

However, few attentions have been paid to utilizing it for forensic purposes, particularly in deleted record recovery. Without using WAL, prior recovery methods have been ineffective. This paper addresses techniques for SQLite forensic analysis based on WAL. Specifically, based on the storage mechanisms of SQLite and the structure of the WAL, both the original SQLite database and WAL are first constructed by extracting and analyzing all valid pages. SQLite history versions are then produced by using two reconstructed files above. Deleted records can then be recovered and tampered behaviors can be detected by comparing different versions of the reconstructed history file. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reconstruct history versions, recover deleted records and detect tampered behaviors effectively.",

This work firstly reveals the internal details of the battery-saving feature, especially about the state transitions. Furthermore, we discover several defects in Androidu0027s device drivers associated with doze mode. By exploiting the defects, we implement various proof-of-concept attacks that could drain battery without acquiring any permissions by subverting doze mode. The proposed attacks are silent (hardly discerned by normal users), because they keep hidden when the smartphone is in use, while letting benign applications do battery-intensive work when the smartphone is unused rather than consuming excessive power by the attacks themselves. Google has confirmed that our attacks can reduce battery life. Finally, we discuss how to defend against the proposed attacks.",

Under the current MCS framework, processes including bidding, task assignment, and sensed data uploading are all potentially risky for participants. As an effort toward this issue, we propose a framework that enhances the location privacy of MCS applications by reducing the bidding and assignment steps in the MCS cycle. Meanwhile, to reduce the unnecessary privacy loss while maintaining the required quality of service (QoS), economic theory is used to help both the service provider and participants to decide their strategies. We propose schemes based on both the Monopoly and Oligopoly models. In the former case, the participants cooperate to gain exclusive control of the supply of crowd sensing data, while the latter case is a state of limited competition. The parameters in different schemes are analyzed, and the strengths and weaknesses of both schemes are discussed. Additionally, the proposed schemes are evaluated by extensive simulations, and the results are discussed in detail.",

        "abstract": "Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) enables fine-grained access control to the encrypted data for commercial applications. There has been significant progress in CP-ABE over the recent years because of two properties called traceability and large universe, greatly enriching the commercial applications of CP-ABE. Traceability is the ability of ABE to trace the malicious users or traitors who intentionally leak the partial or modified decryption keys for profits. Nevertheless, due to the nature of CP-ABE, it is difficult to identify the original key owner from an exposed key since the decryption privilege is shared by multiple users who have the same attributes. On the other hand, the property of large universe in ABE enlarges the practical applications by supporting flexible number of attributes. Several systems have been proposed to obtain either of the above properties. However, none of them achieve the two properties simultaneously in practice, which limits the commercial applications of CP-ABE to a certain extent. In this paper, we propose two practical large universe CP-ABE systems supporting white-box traceability. Compared with existing systems, both the two proposed systems have two advantages: 1) the number of attributes is not polynomially bounded and 2) malicious users who leak their decryption keys could be traced. Moreover, another remarkable advantage of the second proposed system is that the storage overhead for traitor tracing is constant, which are suitable for commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "Cloud-assisted e-healthcare systems significantly facilitate the patients to outsource their personal health information (PHI) for medical treatment of high quality and efficiency. Unfortunately, a series of unaddressed security and privacy issues dramatically impede its practicability and popularity. In e-healthcare systems, it is expected that only the primary physicians responsible for the patients treatment can not only access the PHI content but verify the real identity of the patient. Secondary physicians participating in medical consultation and/or research tasks, however, are only permitted to view or use the content of the protected PHI, while unauthorized entities cannot obtain anything. Existing work mainly focuses on patients conditional identity privacy by exploiting group signatures, which are very computationally costly. In this paper, we propose a white-box traceable and revocable multi-authority attribute-based encryption named TR-MABE to efficiently achieve multilevel privacy preservation without introducing additional special signatures. It can efficiently prevent secondary physicians from knowing the patients identity. Also, it can efficiently track the physicians who leak secret keys used to protect patients identity and PHI. Finally, formal security proof and extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of our proposed TR-MABE in e-healthcare cloud computing systems.",

In this paper, a more efficient verifiable outsourced computation of encrypted data EVOC supporting any functions from any one-way trapdoor function is proposed, based on our newly-devised privacy preserving data aggregation supporting both addition and multiplication operations without exploiting fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It solves the open problem suggested by Gennaro et al. that how to devise a verifiable computation scheme that used a more efficient primitive than FHE. Finally, the formal security proof and extensive efficiency evaluations demonstrate our proposed EVOC satisfies the target security and privacy requirements and far outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of computational and communication complexity.",

        "title": "ReDD: recommendation\u2010based data dissemination in privacy\u2010preserving mobile social networks",
        "abstract": "Mobile social network (MSN), which is built upon popular smart phone devices and enables\n         mobile users with similar interests to connect with one another, has received considerable\n         attention in recent years. A common phenomenon that makes the MSN vivid today is mobile\n         users often like to share attractive things to their friends in MSN. In this paper,\n         based on this common phenomenon, we propose an efficient recommendation\u2010based data\n         dissemination (ReDD) protocol for MSN, which can efficiently disseminate high\u2010quality\n         messages in a privacy\u2010preserving way. Specifically, in the proposed ReDD protocol,\n         each mobile user, based on both his or her own view and his or her friends' recommendations,\n         will form his or her personal estimation on the quality of a message. Only if the\n         estimation of quality reaches a threshold, the message will be disseminated. In this\n         way, high\u2010quality messages can be widely spread in the network and occupy more network\n         resources than low\u2010quality ones. In order to check the validity of friends' recommendations,\n         ReDD also employs an efficient anonymous authentication technique, which ensures that\n         only the friends of a user can verify recommendations made by the user. Detailed security\n         analysis demonstrates that ReDD can effectively resist various attacks launched by\n         attackers and ensure identity privacy of nodes, confidentiality of shared keys and\n         integrity of data packets. In addition, extensive simulations are also conducted to\n         evaluate the performance of ReDD in terms of the number of active nodes and the average\n         active time, and the simulation results show that high\u2010quality messages can be disseminated\n         widely and efficiently, while low\u2010quality ones will be eliminated shortly to avoid\n         occupying network resources.

        "abstract": "Abstract   It is not uncommon that mobile phones are involved in criminal activities, e.g., the surreptitious collection of credit card information. Forensic analysis of mobile applications plays a crucial part in order to gather evidences against criminals. However, traditional forensic approaches, which are based on manual investigation, are not scalable to the large number of mobile applications. On the other hand, dynamic analysis is hard to automate due to the burden of setting up the proper runtime environment to accommodate OS differences and dependent libraries and activate all feasible program paths. We propose a  fully automated  tool,  Fordroid  for the forensic analysis of mobile applications on Android.  Fordroid  conducts inter-component static analysis on Android APKs and builds control flow and data dependency graphs. Furthermore,  Fordroid  identifies what and where information written in local storage with taint analysis. Data is located by traversing the graphs. This addresses several technique challenges, which include inter-component string propagation, string operations (e.g., append) and API invocations. Also,  Fordroid  identifies how the information is stored by parsing SQL commands, i.e., the structure of database tables. Finally, we selected 100 random Android applications consisting of 2841 components from four categories for evaluation. Analysis of all apps took 64\u00a0h. Fordroid discovered 469 paths in 36 applications that wrote sensitive information (e.g., GPS) to local storage. Furthermore,  Fordroid  successfully located where the information was written for 458 (98%) paths and identified the structure of all (22) database tables.",

        "abstract": "Being the largest blockchain with the capability of running smart contracts, Ethereum has attracted wide attention and its market capitalization has reached 20 billion USD. Ethereum not only supports its cryptocurrency named Ether but also provides a decentralized platform to execute smart contracts in the Ethereum virtual machine. Although Etheru0027s price is approaching 200 USD and nearly 600K smart contracts have been deployed to Ethereum, little is known about the characteristics of its users, smart contracts, and the relationships among them. To fill in the gap, in this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on Ethereum by leveraging graph analysis to characterize three major activities on Ethereum, namely money transfer, smart contract creation, and smart contract invocation. We design a new approach to collect all transaction data, construct three graphs from the data to characterize major activities, and discover new observations and insights from these graphs. Moreover, we propose new approaches based on cross-graph analysis to address two security issues in Ethereum. The evaluation through real cases demonstrates the effectiveness of our new approaches.",

        "abstract": "Six pieces of concrete-filled cold-formed square steel tube beams subjected to low-cycle reversed loading was tested,and nonlinear finiete element anaysis was also conducted to explore the effects of span to height ratios and width to thickness ratios of cross-section on the hysteretic behavior,ductility,and ability of energy dissipation.Some important conclusions can be drawn from the experiments and the nonlinear analysis and listed as follows:(1)The concrete-filled cold-formed square steel tube beams exhibit stable hysteresis behavior up to local buckling and then show considerable good ductility and good ability of energy dissipation.The pinch-crinkle phenomena do not occur in the hysteresis loops of load-displacement.(2) The hysteresis behavior and ductility of concrete-filled cold-formed square steel tube beams depend on the span to height ratios and width to thickness ratios.(3) The proposed nonlinear FE model could accurately predict the overall seismic behavior and the inelastic performance of the concrete-filled cold-formed square steel tube beams.The hysteresis loops from nonlinear FE models under low-cycle reversed loading agree well with those from the low-cyclic reversed loading tests.The proposed nonlinear FE model could also be used to conduct the nonlinear parameter analysis of the cold-fromed composite beams.",

Influences of temperature on the CdS, ZnS transmission spectral characteristics, optical band gap, Raman spectral characteristics were studied. The results show, (1) The transmission of ZnS films is higher than that of CdS, and ZnS has larger optical band gap; (2) ZnS films show complex Raman spectrum and weak Raman peaks, while CdS films show distinct Raman peaks; (3) With increasing temperature, CdS band gap increased significantly in comparison to that of ZnS, Raman peak became higher and narrower.

Results show that the films are grown with single chalcopyrite structure preferential (112) orientation, within 40-400\u00b0C, the grains size, crystallization quality are almost not influenced with temperature, while the temperature reached 600\u00b0C, grains size and crystal quality, the infrared light transmittance etc. increased significantly. These phenomena are mainly attributed to the effect of substrate temperature on the diffusion of the Ga elements, at high temperature, the diffusion is sufficient and the crystal structure reorganization is finished. The relationship between Se composition and temperature was also analyzed. Copyright\u00a9 2011, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research. Published by Elsevier BV.All rights reserved.",

However, most of organic molecules exhibit small Stokes shift and reduced MPA in the highly polar solvents, which may seriously hinder their related applications. In this work, one styrylpyridinium salt has been synthesized, which exhibits outstanding properties such as bright red fluorescence at the wavelength of 626 nm in a highly polar solvent (DMSO). Importantly, it is noted that the material also exhibits strong two- and three-photon absorption action cross-section (delta(2PA) = 597 GM and delta(3P)A = 18 x 10(-80) cm(6).s(2).photon(-2), respectively), which can be excited in near-infrared (NIR) window I (650-900 nm) and NIR window II (1000-1450 nm).

        "abstract": "Nanocomposites with organic-inorganic properties represent a new field of basic research and offer prospects for many novel applications in extremely diverse fields, due to their remarkable emerging new properties and multifunctional nature. However, controllable manipulation of their fluorescent properties in different phases is still challenging, which seriously limits the related applications of nanocomposites. In this work, a convenient protocol to fabricate organic-inorganic nanocomposites composed of stilbene chromophores and CdZnS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) pairs, with controllable fluorescent properties is presented. It is found that stable white-light emission can be achieved only in solution phase, with negligible energy transfer or reabsorption between chromophores and QDs pairs. By contrast, when the nanocomposites are deposited as blended films, they cannot give rise to white-light emission, no matter what donor/acceptor volume ratios are used. However, the blended films can exhibit near-unity efficiency (94%) of Forster resonance energy transfer from QDs to chromophores. The underlying physical mechanisms are revealed through comprehensive steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic analysis. This work suggests that the CdZnS/ZnS QDs/stilbene nanocomposites can be directly used for fluorescence sensors and probes in biological system as well as fundamental investigation of light-harvesting, and also sheds light on developing other new materials for artificial photosynthesis and optoelectronics.",

The main results are (1) PLD method is versatile for preparing oxide material or complex component films with excellent controllability and high reproducibility. (2) Anatase nitrogen-doped TiO 2 films were prepared at room temperature, 200\u00b0C, and 400\u00b0C by PLD method using novel ceramic target of mixture of TiN and TiO 2. UV/Vis spectra, AFM, Raman spectra, and photocatalystic activity for decomposition of methyl orange (MO) tests showed that visible light response was improved at higher temperature.

        "abstract": "In conventional pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, plume deflection and composition distribution change with the laser incident direction and pulse energy, then causing uneven film thickness and composition distribution for a multicomponent film and eventually leading to low device quality and low rate of final products. We present a novel method based on PLD for depositing large GIGS films with uniform thickness and stoichiometry. By oscillating a mirror placed coaxially with the incident laser beam, the laser's focus is scanned across the rotating target surface. This arrangement maintains a constant reflectance and optical distance, ensuring that a consistent energy density is delivered to the target surface by each laser pulse. Scanning the laser spot across the target suppresses the formation of micro-columns, and thus the plume deflection effect that reduces film uniformity in conventional PLD technique is eliminated. This coaxial scanning PLD method is used to deposit a CIGS film, 500 nm thick, with thickness uniformity exceeding +/- 3% within a 5 cm diameter, and exhibiting a highly homogeneous elemental distribution.",

Studies were made of the effects of the pulse repetition rate (PRR) on the film microstructures, optical and anticoagulation properties by spectroscopic ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy and platelet adhesion test, respectively. The results show that our DLC samples have high Sp3 C contents and good anticoagulation. The Sp3 C contents and the anticoagulation of the films are affected by the PRR due to the different energies of incident carbon ions. The Sp3 C contents of the films generally increase with the PRR, reaching maximum values at the rate of 50 Hz and then decrease. Moreover, DLC films with higher Sp3 C contents have better anticoagulation.",

        "abstract": "Ligand-induced chirality in semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) has attracted attention because of the tunable optical properties of the NCs. Induced circular dichroism (CD) has been observed in CdX (X = S, Se, Te) NCs and their hybrids, but circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in these fluorescent nanomaterials has been seldom reported. Herein, we describe the successful preparation of L- and D-cysteine-capped CdSe-dot/CdS-rods (DRs) with tunable CD and CPL behaviors and a maximum anisotropic factor (glum) of 4.66 \u00d7 10-4. The observed CD and CPL activities are sensitive to the relative absorption ratio of the CdS shell to the CdSe core, suggesting that the anisotropic g-factors in both CD and CPL increase to some extent for a smaller shell-to-core absorption ratio. In addition, the molar ratio of chiral cysteine to the DRs is investigated. Instead of enhancing the chiral interactions between the chiral molecules and DRs, an excess of cysteine molecules in aqueous solution inhibits both the CD and CPL activities. Such chiral and emissive NCs provide an ideal platform for the rational design of semiconductor nanomaterials with chiroptical properties.",

In this work, for the first time, we report the MPA properties of three chiral DPP derivatives by the modern analytical response theory. The calculated results demonstrate that all of the three molecules show superior two- and three-photon absorption (2 and 3PA) in the near-infrared window I and II, respectively, which are promising materials for deep tissue imaging applications. More importantly, they show excellent two-photon circular dichroism (2PCD) spectra. And, the calculations of orbital transitions elucidate that the intramolecular charge transfer contributes to the molecular strong MPA and 2PCD.",

Owing to the wide range of potential applications of chiral perovskite NCs, the development of these materials is of great importance, but there has been a lack of relevant studies. Here, we describe an investigation of the properties of chiral perovskite NCs obtained using post-synthetic ligand exchange (achiral ligand/chiral ligand). These are found to exhibit mirror-image circular dichroism spectra. It is the chirality of the ligand (enantiomeric 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, DACH) that is most likely responsible for the induction of chiroptical activity in these NCs. Furthermore, their chiroptical properties and the corresponding mechanisms are found to depend strongly on the amount of capping ligand. When excess DACH is used to cap the surface of the NCs, their chiroptical properties are induced mainly by aggregation of DACH on the surface in a chiral pattern. In ...",

However, it is difficult to achieve excellent CD and CPL in differently polar solvents simultaneously. This work provides a simple but efficient way to construct violet-blue fluorescent and water-soluble chromophore through the construction of rigid conformation of the alkyne architecture. By introducing proline pendants into alkyne architecture, the chromophore exhibits reasonable CD and CPL properties in the lowly and highly polar solvents. More importantly, even in water, the chromophore displays effective CD anisotropy factor (g abs \u00a0\u223c\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22123 ) and luminescence dissymmetry factor (g lum \u00a0\u223c\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22123 ), as well as high fluorescence quantum yield (\u03a6 up to 35%). Additionally, the chromophore exhibits large two-photon CD according to the theoretically calculated results. The excellent chiroptical properties from the simple organic fluorophore enables its future applications in miniatured optoelectronic devices and CPL-based bioimaging.",

        "abstract": "Autofluorescence is a major challenge in complex tissue imaging when molecules present in the biological tissue compete with the fluorophore. This issue may be resolved by designing organic molecules with long fluorescence lifetimes. The present work reports the two-photon absorption (TPA) properties of a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule with carbazole as the electron donor and dicyanobenzene as the electron acceptor (i.e., 4CzIPN). The results indicate that 4CzIPN exhibits a moderate TPA cross-section (\u223c9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221250\u2009cm4 s photon\u22121), high fluorescence quantum yield, and a long fluorescence lifetime (\u223c1.47\u2009\u03bcs). 4CzIPN was compactly encapsulated into an amphiphilic copolymer via nanoprecipitation to achieve water-soluble organic dots. Interestingly, 4CzIPN organic dots have been utilized in applications involving two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Our work aptly demonstrates that TADF molecules are promising candidates of nonlinear optical probes for developing next-genera...",

The two- and three-photon absorption coefficients of the doped PVA films were determined as 0.58\u00a0cm/GW at 800\u00a0nm and 2.3\u00d710\u2009\u2009cm/GW at 1300\u00a0nm, respectively.

Spectroscopic studies reveal that the derivatives violate Kasha's rule and emit from their upper-excited states (S  ,  > 1). The transition assignments are supported by time-dependent density functional theory calculations. More importantly, both chromophores exhibit anisotropy factors on the order of \u223c10 to 10 for circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from upper-excited states. Additionally, the nonplanar geometry of the derivatives induces a significant yield of triplet excited states. Transient absorption spectroscopic measurements reveal high triplet quantum yields of \u223c86% for  and \u223c81% for . Through  studies, we demonstrate that the derivatives can be used as photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents, providing a highly efficient form of cancer therapy.

        "abstract": "Compared with traditional organic contrast agents, semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have unique optical properties that are vital for biological applications with ultrahigh sensitivities, such as long fluorescence lifetime and large multiphoton absorption (MPA). However, the MPA properties and biological applications of chiral-ligand-stabilized semiconductor NCs have scarcely been reported, which seriously hinders their relevant applications. In this work, we report the aqueous phase transfer of CdSe/CdS dot/rod NCs with the use of cysteine molecules, after which the NCs preserve their high fluorescence quantum yield, long lifetime, and efficient circular dichroism. More importantly, the investigated dot/rod NCs show extremely large two- and three-photon absorption action cross-sections in the first and second biological windows, with maximum values of \u223c21\u2009000 GM at 800 nm and \u223c4.6 \u00d7 10-78 cm6 s2 per photon2 at 1300 nm, which are among the largest values reported for water-soluble fluorescent nanoparticles. Interestingly, the dot/rod NCs exhibit a high singlet oxygen generation efficiency of 35%. In addition, for the first time, two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging and photodynamic therapy of the dot/rod NCs were successfully demonstrated. The performed investigation of the optical properties of these water-soluble CdSe/CdS dot/rod NCs indicates that they are promising candidates for nonlinear biological imaging applications.",

However, most of fluorescent chromophores fall short of the full potential due to the absence of the combination of such different nonlinear upconversion behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that an exceptional fluorescent stilbene dye could exhibit efficient two- and three-photon absorption under the excitation of femtosecond pulses in solution phase. Benefiting from its biocompatibility and strong excited state absorption behavior, in vitro two-photon bioimaging and superior optical limiting have been exploited, respectively. Simultaneously, the chromophore could generate efficient three-photon excited fluorescence and third-harmonic generation (THG) when dispersed into PMMA film, circumventing the limitations of classical fluorescent chromophores. Such chromophore may find application in the production of coherent light sources of higher photon energy. Moreover, the combination of three-photon excited fluorescence and THG can be used in tandem to provide complementary information in biomedical studies. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",

        "abstract": "Light-emitting nonlinear optical molecules, especially those with large Stokes shifts and broad tunability of their emission wavelength, have attracted considerable attention for various applications including biomedical imaging and fluorescent sensors. However, most fluorescent chromophores have only limited potential for such applications due to small Stokes shifts, narrow tunability of fluorescence emissions, and small optical nonlinearity in highly polar solvents. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-photon absorbing stilbene chromophore exhibits a large two-photon absorption action cross-section (eta delta = 320GM) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and shows broad fluorescence tunability (125 nm) by manipulating the polarity of the surrounding medium. Importantly, a very large Stokes shift of up to 227 nm is achieved in DMSO. Thanks to these features, this chromophore can be utilized as a two-photon probe for bioimaging applications and in an ultrasensitive solid-state gas detector. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.",

        "abstract": "Multiphoton fluorescence imaging of tissues offers an essential tool for studying biological systems. However, autofluorescence becomes a serious issue in complicated tissue imaging where biological molecules compete with the fluorophore. Such a critical issue can be resolved through the design of phosphorescent molecules with long emission lifetime. In this work, the nonlinear optical properties of small phosphorescent polymer dots (Pdots) with strong red-emitting phosphorescence (620 nm) have been disclosed. An analysis of decay data from fs pump-probe experiment yields a value of 164 ps for the singlet excited state lifetime of the Pdots. Notably, thanks to efficient two-photon excited energy transfer and moderate phosphorescence quantum yield (eta = 1.36%), the Pdots exhibit large two-photon absorption action cross-section (eta delta(max) = 15 GM) in aqueous solution. Results of living cell imaging experiments show the potential of these Pdots in two-photon time-resolved phosphorescent microscopy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is associated with widespread and complex cerebral blood flow (CBF) disturbance. Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) and insight are the core symptoms of schizophrenia. However, to the best of our knowledge, very few studies have assessed the CBF characteristics of the AVH suffered by schizophrenic patients with and without insight. Based on our previous findings, Using a 3D pseudo-continuous ASL (pcASL) technique, we investigated the differences in AVH-related CBF alterations in schizophrenia patients with and without insight. We used statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) and statistical non-parametric mapping (SnPM13) to perform the fMRI analysis. We found that AVH-schizophrenia patients without insight showed an increased CBF in the left temporal pole and a decreased CBF in the right middle frontal gyrus when compared to AVH-schizophrenia patients with insight. Our novel findings suggest that AVH-schizophrenia patients without insight possess a more complex CBF disturbance. Simultaneously, our findings also incline to support the idea that the CBF aberrant in some specific brain regions may be the common neural basis of insight and AVH. Our findings support the mostly current hypotheses regarding AVH to some extent. Although our findings come from a small sample, it provide the evidence that indicate us to conduct a larger study to thoroughly explore the mechanisms of schizophrenia, especially the core symptoms of AVHs and insight.",

        "abstract": "We previously generated a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy and found that the expression of long non-coding RNA H19 was downregulated. The present study was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition, overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3 expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR signaling. In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy in cardiomyocytes by epigenetically silencing of DIRAS3, which might provide novel insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a commonly-used atypical antipsychotic, risperidone, on alterations in spatial learning and in the hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) signalling system caused by acute dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) treatment. In experiment 1, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to acute treatment of either low-dose MK801 (0.1 mg/kg) or normal saline (vehicle) were tested for spatial object recognition and hippocampal expression levels of BDNF, TrkB and the phophorylation of TrkB (p-TrkB). We found that compared to the vehicle, MK-801 treatment impaired spatial object recognition of animals and downregulated the expression levels of p-TrkB. In experiment 2, MK-801- or vehicle-treated animals were further injected with risperidone (0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle before behavioural testing and sacrifice. Of note, we found that risperidone successfully reversed the deleterious effects of MK-801 on spatial object recognition and upregulated the hippocampal BDNF-TrkB signalling system. Collectively, the findings suggest that cognitive deficits from acute -methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockade may be associated with the hypofunction of hippocampal BDNF-TrkB signalling system and that risperidone was able to reverse these alterations.",

However, associations between occupational factors and sexual life satisfaction (SLS) of nurses remain understudied. This study investigated SLS of Chinese female nurses of tertiary general hospitals and socio-demographic and occupational factors associated with reduced SLS of nurses. In this cross-sectional survey, 393 Chinese female nurses of four tertiary general hospitals completed a standardized socio-demographic and occupational characteristics questionnaire, Zung's Self-rating Scale for Depression, Job Content Questionnaire, and a self-report SLS question. Multiple ordinal logistic regression was used to identify factors related to reduced SLS. Fourteen point five percent female nurses were dissatisfied with their current sex lives. In multiple regression, related factors for decreased SLS included being unmarried (OR = 1.49), shift work (OR = 1.92), contract employment (OR = 1.63), high job demands (OR = 2.21), low job control (OR = 1.88), inadequate social support (OR = 2.32), and depression (OR = 3.14). Chinese female nurses of tertiary general hospitals have poor SLS. Reducing job stress and providing psycho-social support may help improve SLS of nurses.",

        "abstract": "Investigation of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in schizophrenics is complicated by psychiatric symptoms. Investigating healthy individuals with AVHs (H-AVHs) can obviate such confounding factors. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of antipsychotic treatment on AVHs and gray matter volumes (GMVs) in H-AVH subjects and whether such are effects are influenced by COMT-Val158Met genotype. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genotyping studies were completed for 42 H-AVH subjects and 42 well-matched healthy controls (HCs). COMT-Met/Met homozygotes (158th codon) were identified as COMT-Met genotype; COMT-Met/Val heterozygotes and COMT-Val/Val homozygotes were identified as COMT-Val genotype. Data were compared across groups (H-AVH vs. HC, and between genotypes) with two-sample t-tests. The H-AVH COMT-Met group showed a stronger response to antipsychotic treatment than the H-AVH COMT-Val group (p\u00a0<\u20090.001). Both H-AVH genotype groups exhibited temporal lobe GMV reductions after treatment, and relative to their respective genotype-matched HC groups. Antipsychotic treatment effects in H-AVH subjects were influenced by COMT-Val158Met genotype and associated with widespread GMV reductions. These findings provide clues for further exploration of treatment targets for AVHs. Treatment associated GMV reductions, however, raise concerns about use of antipsychotics in H-AVH subjects.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a genetically related mental illness, in which the majority of genetic alterations occur in the non-coding regions of the human genome. In the past decade, a growing number of regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified to be strongly associated with schizophrenia. However, the studies of these ncRNAs in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the reverting of their genetic defects in restoration of the normal phenotype have been hampered by insufficient technology to manipulate these ncRNA genes effectively as well as a lack of appropriate animal models. Most recently, a revolutionary gene editing technology known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) (CRISPR/Cas9) has been developed that enable researchers to overcome these challenges. In this review, we mainly focus on the schizophrenia-related ncRNAs and the use of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing on the non-coding regions of the genomic DNA in proving causal relationship between the genetic defects and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We subsequently discuss the potential of translating this advanced technology into a clinical therapy for schizophrenia, although the CRISPR/Cas9 technology is currently still in its infancy and immature to put into use in the treatment of diseases. Furthermore, we suggest strategies to accelerate the pace from the bench to the bedside. This is review describing the application of the powerful and feasible CRISPR/Cas9 technology to manipulate schizophrenia-associated ncRNA genes. This technology could help researchers tackle this complex health problem and perhaps other genetically related mental disorders due to the overlapping genetic alterations of schizophrenia with other mental illnesses.",

Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the salience network (SN) in patients with post traumatic distress disorder and that hyperactivity of the SN is associated with AVHs in patients with psychosis. Patients with post traumatic distress disorder may benefit from aripiprazole; however, studies investigating the effect of aripiprazole on AVHs and activity in the SN in patients with post traumatic distress disorder are scarce. Therefore, we conducted an outcomes analysis using functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the effects of add-on aripiprazole treatment on AVHs and brain functional connectivity in patients with post traumatic distress disorder. AVHs were alleviated by add-on aripiprazole treatment (Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale [AHRS] score reduced by \u2265 50%) in 22.7% of patients. Functional activity in the SN was obviously decreased in patients in whom AHRS scores were reduced \u2265 50% following add-on aripiprazole treatment compared to patients in whom AHRS scores were reduced by <50%. The decrease in functional connectivity within the SN was significantly correlated with the reduction in total AHRS scores. Although this study was associated with several limitations, the findings suggest that add-on aripiprazole treatment can alleviate AVHs in patients with post traumatic distress disorder by reducing activity in the SN.",

Aims   To summarise available evidence and quantify the association between schizophrenia and cancer mortality using meta-analysis.   Method   We systematically searched literature in the PubMed and Embase databases. Risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals reported in individual studies were pooled using the DerSimonian\u2013Laird random-effects model.   Results   We included 19 studies in the meta-analysis. Among them, 15 studies reported standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) comparing patients with schizophrenia with the general population, and the pooled SMR was 1.40 (95% CI 1.29\u20131.52,  P   P  = 0.006).   Conclusions   Patients with schizophrenia are at a significantly increased risk of cancer mortality compared with the general population or individuals without schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Dopaminergic system dysfunction is involved in schizophrenia (SCZ) pathogenesis and can mediate SCZ-related motor disorders. Recent studies have gradually revealed that SCZ susceptibility and the associated motor symptoms can be mediated by genetic factors, including dopaminergic genes. More importantly, polymorphisms in these genes are associated with both antipsychotic drug sensitivity and adverse effects. The study of genetic polymorphisms in the dopaminergic system may help to optimize individualized drug strategies for SCZ patients. This review summarizes the current progress about the involvement of the dopamine system in SCZ-associated motor disorders and the motor-related adverse effects after antipsychotic treatment, with a special focus on polymorphisms in dopaminergic genes. We hypothesize that the genetic profile of the dopaminergic system mediates both SCZ-associated motor deficits associated and antipsychotic drug-related adverse effects. The study of dopaminergic gene polymorphisms may help to predict drug efficacy and decrease adverse effects, thereby optimizing treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Due to recent advances in human genomic technologies, there have been explosive interests and extensive research on the genomics of schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by social cognitive deficits, hallucinations, and delusions. These new technologies, including next-generation sequencing (NGS), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-associated nuclease 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) genome editing platform are capable of interrogating and editing the genome directly. In the past few years, these efforts have led to the identification of important loci and genes susceptible to schizophrenia. The findings have increased our understanding of the underlying genetic causes of schizophrenia and aided in the development of new approaches for more effectively diagnosing and treating schizophrenia. Despite the substantial progress, there are several unanswered questions about the genomics of schizophrenia, and there are a number of potential shortcomings in the current literature considering the complexity of the disease and limits of the current technologies. In the present review, we assessed the existing literature on the genomics of schizophrenia, identifying the strengths and study design shortcomings from the following aspects: elucidation of the pathogenesis, early risk prediction and diagnosis, and the treatment of schizophrenia. Moreover, we have proposed solutions to overcome the shortcomings of past studies. Lastly, we have discussed the importance of developing multidisciplinary teams and global research groups in order to improve the lives of schizophrenic patients globally.",

        "abstract": " To investigate whether APOE \u03b54 affects the association of verbal memory with neurodegeneration presented by the hippocampal volume/intracranial volume ratio (HpVR).  The study sample included 371 individuals with normal cognition (NC), 725 subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 251 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who underwent the rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT). Multiple linear regression models were conducted to assess the effect of the APOE \u03b54HpVR interaction on RAVLT in all subjects and in each diagnostic group adjusting for age, gender and educational attainment, and global cognition.  In all subjects, there was no significant APOE \u03b54 \u00d7 HpVR interaction for immediate recall or delayed recall ( > 0.05). However, in aMCI subjects, there was a significant APOE \u03b54 \u00d7 HpVR interaction for delayed recall ( = 0.008), but not immediate recall ( = 0.15). More specifically, the detrimental effect of APOE \u03b54 on delayed recall altered by HpVR such that this effect was most evident among subjects with small to moderate HpVR, but this disadvantage was absent or even reversed among subjects with larger HpVR. No significant interaction was observed in the NC or AD group.  These findings highlight a potential role of APOE \u03b54 status in affecting the association of hippocampus size with delayed recall memory in the early stage of AD.",

        "abstract": "Our aim was to examine whether the influence of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype on cognitive decline differs in male and female across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. Among individuals with normal cognition (NC; n\u200a=\u200a415), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n\u200a=\u200a870), and AD (n\u200a=\u200a334), we investigated the longitudinal associations of APOE4 genotype and sex with cognitive decline over 13 years. Our cognitive outcomes were Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) total learning score and delayed recall and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. There were significant effects of the APOE4\u00d7sex interaction on change in verbal memory in the MCI group, but not the NC or AD group. Specifically, among individuals with MCI, female APOE4 carriers had a steeper decline in RAVLT total learning score, but not delayed recall or MMSE score compared to all other groups (APOE4\u200a+\u200a/Male, APOE4-/Female, APOE4-/Male). In conclusion, female APOE4 carriers have faster rates of memory decline than their male counterparts among MCI individuals.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND ABCA2 has been genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but its mRNA expression and epigenetics in AD have not been investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS To explore the diagnosis value of ABCA2 mRNA expression in AD, 2 datasets GES15222 and GSE33000 containing expression profile of brain cortex tissues and 2 datasets GSE63063 (Cohort 1) and GSE63063 (Cohort 2) containing expression profile of blood were downloaded from the NCBI GEO database and analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses and logistic regression. The ABCA2 co-expressed genes were also analyzed by GO annotation to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms. RESULTS The analyses results suggested ABCA2 mRNA expression was upregulated significantly in AD compared with controls in all datasets. ROC analysis suggested that ABCA2 was associated with AD in all datasets, which were also proved by univariate and multivariate analyses. Next, the dataset GSE80970 containing methylation profiles of prefrontal cortex tissues from AD patients were downloaded and analyzed. Methylation of 2 of 36 CpG islands in ABCA2 gene with high diagnostic accuracy of AD from controls in ROC analyses were found to be negatively associated with AD risk in univariate analysis. One was still associated with AD risk after adjustment of confounding factors. Additional analyses indicated that ACBA2 mRNA expression could be used to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Huntington's disease (HD) from controls and to distinguish HD from AD, but not AD from MCI. Furthermore, the genes involved in AD during ABCA2 alteration were analyzed by GO analysis. CONCLUSIONS ABCA2 mRNA expression and methylation is associated AD risk. ABCA2 may be used as a biomarker for AD diagnosis and may be a potential therapeutic target of AD.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with largely unknown genetic mechanisms. Identifying altered neuronal gene expression in AD may provide diagnostic or therapeutic targets for AD. The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their further association with other biological processes that regulate causative factors for AD. The present study performed an integrated analysis of publicly available gene expression omnibus datasets of AD hippocampi. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and Protein\u2011Protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed. The present study detected 295 DEGs (109 upregulated and 186 downregulated genes) in hippocampi between AD and control samples by integrating four datasets of gene expression profiles of hippocampi of patients with AD. Respiratory electron transport chain (GO: 0022904; P=1.64x10\u201111) was the most significantly enriched GO term among biological processes, while for molecular functions, the most significantly enriched GO term was that of protein binding (GO: 0005515; P=3.03x10\u201129), and for cellular components, the most significantly enriched GO term was that of the cytoplasm (GO: 0005737; P=8.67x10\u201133). The most signi\ufb01cant pathway in the KEGG analysis was oxidative phosphorylation (P=1.61x10\u201113). PPI network analysis showed that the significant hub proteins contained \u03b2-actin (degree, 268), hepatoma-derived growth factor (degree, 218) and WD repeat\u2011containing protein 82 (degree, 87). The integrated analysis performed in the present study serves as a basis for identifying novel drug targets to develop improved therapies and interventions for common and devastating neurological diseases such as AD.",

In our investigation, a novel nanozyme-based bio-barcode fluorescence amplified assay is successfully developed for simultaneous detection of HIV and HCV DNAs with excellent sensitivity in an enzyme-free and label-free condition. Here, bimetallic nanoparticles, PtAu, present outstanding peroxidase-like activity and act as barcode to catalyze oxidation of nonfluorescent substrate of amplex red (AR) into fluorescent resorufin generating stable and sensitive \"Turn On\" fluorescent output signal, which is for the first time to be integrated with bio-barcode strategy for fluorescence detection DNA. Furthermore, the provided strategy presents excellent specificity and can distinguish single-base mismatched mutant from target DNA. What interesting is that cascaded INHIBIT-OR logic gate is integrated with biosensors for the first time to distinguish individual target DNA from each other under logic function control, which presents great application in development of rapid and intelligent detection.",

Herein, a straightforward and powerful strategy in which a guanine-rich DNA sequence lighting up a silver nanocluster and fluorophore was developed to construct a library of logic gates on a simple DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) platform. This library included basic logic gates, YES, AND, OR, INHIBIT, and XOR, which were further integrated into complex logic circuits to implement diverse advanced arithmetic/non-arithmetic functions including half-adder, half-subtractor, multiplexer, and demultiplexer. Under UV irradiation, all the logic functions could be instantly visualized, confirming an excellent repeatability. The logic operations were entirely based on DNA hybridization in an enzyme-free and label-free condition, avoiding waste accumulation and reducing cost consumption. Interestingly, a DNA-AgNCs-based multiplexer was, for the first time, used as an intelligent biosensor to identify pathogenic genes,  and  genes, with a high sensitivity. The investigation provides a prototype for the wireless integration of multiple devices on even the simplest single-strand DNA platform to perform diverse complex functions in a straightforward and cost-effective way.",

Herein, a MnO nanosheet (MnO-NS)-based ratiometric fluorescent nanosensor has been developed for high sensitive and specific detection of AA. The MnO-NS presents peroxidase-like activity and can oxidize non-fluorescent substrate of o-phenylenediamine (OPDA) into fluorescent substrate, presenting maximum fluorescence at 568\u00a0nm (F). If MnO-NS is premixed with AA, the MnO-NS is then decomposed as Mn by AA, decreasing the fluorescent intensity of F. Meantime, AA is oxidized as dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), which can react with OPDA to generate fluorescent substrate. A new fluorescence response is found at 425\u00a0nm (F). The dual fluorescent responses can be excited with a universal excitation wavelength, simplifying the detection procedure. With F/F as readout, limit of detection for AA reaches as low as 10.0\u00a0nM. Satisfactory recoveries are found for AA detection in serum and diverse beverages. The ratiometric strategy significantly eliminates false-negative and false-positive results, providing a cost-effective, rapid, and reliable way for AA detection in real sample.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Antibiotic residues in food products significantly threaten public health. In the present work, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based ratiometric fluorescent biosensor was developed for high sensitive and selective detection of kanamycin by combining aptamer-recognition assay and signal amplification strategy. To improve detection sensitivity, the optimum FRET efficiency of donor-acceptor was explored by modulating the separation distance between the donor (Cy3) and the acceptor (Cy5). In the developed biosensing system, kanamycin could be trapped by its aptamer, which triggered a polymerase-catalyzed amplification (PCA) process to autonomously generate a single-strand DNA. In subsequence, the generated DNA strand initiated the second amplification process of catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) to cause fluorescence decreasing of Cy3 and increasing of Cy5. The signal change caused by FRET of donor (Cy3)-acceptor (Cy5) was then augmented by the PCA and CHA processes. The constructed biosensors results in high sensitive detection of kanamycin as low as 0.29\u2009nM within a linear range from 1.0\u2009nM to 80.0\u2009nM. The potential application of the developed biosensing system was evaluated with milk as real sample. The provided strategy could serve as a prototype for developing FRET-based ratiometric bioassays.",

For the first time, herein, a reusable and ratiometric fluorescent biosensor with simple operation was developed for sensitive and rapid detection of Cys on the basis of configuration transformation of guanine-rich DNA (G-DNA). The sensing system is quite simple and consisted of G-DNA and Ag +  with NMM (N-methylmesoporphyrin IX) and terbium ion (Tb 3+ ) as the two fluorescence probes. The Ag +  assists the G-DNA to keep its random single-strand structure (ssG-DNA), generating a distinct fluorescence of Tb 3+  and a faint fluorescence of NMM. The analyte of cysteine (Cys) can strongly coordinate with Ag + , thus, the ssG-DNA is transferred into G-quadruplex (G4) configuration. The fluorescence of NMM is then outstandingly augmented, while the fluorescence of Tb 3+  is significantly depressed. With the fluorescent intensity ratio of F NMM /F Tb  as readout signal, the detection limit of the developed ratiometric fluorescent biosensor reaches as low as 4.1\u2009nM, confirming the excellent sensitivity. After completing the Cys detection, Ag +  is further added to disrupt the G-quadruplex into random single-strand G-DNA, which restores the sensing system into the initial state. The reversible configuration change between G-quadruplex and single-stand G-DNA endows the as-developed sensing system with charming reusability for specific detection of Cys. The developed sensing assay is cost-effective and operated in an enzyme-free and label-free condition, providing a straightforward and effective \u201cmix-then-test\u201d strategy to meet the requirement for practical application in disease monitoring and diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lead ion (Pb 2+ ) is known as a major non-degradable environmental pollutant and is quite harmful to human health. In our investigation, a novel ratiometric fluorescent nanosensor with DNA-AgNCs as single fluorophore has been successfully constructed for ultrasensitive and specific detection of Pb 2+ . The single-strand DNA templated silver nanoclusters present green emission, which can be converted into red emission after approaching a specific DNA segment by forming duplex with its complementary DNA strands (ds-DNA-AgNCs). The ds-DNA-AgNCs contains rA cleavage site of Pb 2+ -dependent DNAzyme configuration. In the presence of Pb 2+ , the specific DNA segment would be released from the ds-DNA-AgNCs, resulting in discoloration of DNA-AgNCs from red to green. Since Pb 2+  can successively cleave the rA site, the signal change from red to green emission is amplified. Thus, benefiting from the Pb 2+ -dependent DNAzyme and the charming properties of DNA-AgNCs, the proposed platform exhibits a good linear relationship from 0.001\u2009nM to 10\u2009nM with a detection limit of 1.0\u2009pM for Pb 2+  determination, which is lower than most of the reported Pb 2+  biosensors. Moreover, this sensitive ratiometric fluorescent probe exhibits excellent selectivity toward Pb 2+  detection in real samples, such as lake water, tap water, and human serum samples, illustrating the huge potential applications for complicated samples in the future.",

        "abstract": "Precisely locating tumor site based on tumor-microenvironment-induced (TMI) multimodal imaging is especially interesting for accurate and efficient cancer therapy. In the present investigation, a novel TMI all-in-one nanoplatform, CuS@DOX@MnO, has been successfully fabricated for chemical and photothermal (Chem-PTT) therapy guided by multimodal imaging on tumor site. Here, the CuS nanocages with mesoporous and hollow structure (CuS) acting as nanocarriers provide high capacity for loading the anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX). The outer layer of the MnO nanoshell (MnO) acts as \"gatekeeper\" to control the DOX release until the nanoplatform arrives at the tumor site, where abundant glutathione and H decompose MnO into paramagnetic Mn. The magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescent imaging were then triggered to locate the tumor, which was further improved by photothermal imaging on account of the intrinsic property of CuS. Guided by the multimode imaging, the combination of chemical therapy upon DOX and photothermal therapy upon CuS exhibits eminent efficiency on tumor ablation. The nanoplatform exhibits biocompatibility to avoid unwanted harm to normal tissues during trans-shipment in the body. The investigation thus develops a cost-effective TMI nanoplatform with facile preparations and easy integration of Chem-PTT treatment capabilities guided by multimodal imaging for potential application in precise therapy.",

The Co3O4 shell worked as an efficient charge separation layer while the metallic Co inner core transported the separated charges immediately to the N-carbon framework. By constructing a Schottky barrier between the Co3O4 shell and metallic Co core, the charge separation and transport processes were speeded up and thus the electrocatalytic activities were dramatically enhanced.",

Among these, voltage fading is one of the most serious problems for their final practical applications. Herein, we successfully synthesized hollow spherical Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 Mn 0.54 O 2  cathode material with MnO 2  hollow spheres as the templates. The as-prepared sample was spherically secondary particles with hollow cavities. It showed improved cycle stability, rate capability, and suppression of voltage fading. After 100 cycles at 1\u202fC, the retention of average discharge voltage could reach up to 97.0% (the average voltage loss was only 0.103\u202fV). It can be attributed to the hollow structure which could release the stress of lithium removal, leading to the suppressed migration of transition metal ions into the lithium layers and the transformation from layered phase to spinel-like phase.",

        "abstract": "Summary  The aprotic lithium-oxygen (Li-O 2 ) battery has attracted worldwide attention because of its ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, its practical application is critically hindered by cathode passivation, large polarization, and severe parasitic reactions. Here, we demonstrate an originally designed Ru(II) polypyridyl complex (RuPC) though which the reversible expansion of Li 2 O 2  formation and decomposition can be achieved in Li-O 2  batteries. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that the RuPC can not only expand the formation of Li 2 O 2  in electrolyte but also suppress the reactivity of LiO 2  intermediate during discharge, thus alleviating the cathode passivation and parasitic reactions significantly. In addition, an initial delithiation pathway can be achieved when charging in turn; thus, the Li 2 O 2  products can be decomposed reversibly with a low overpotential. Consequently, the RuPC-catalyzed Li-O 2  batteries exhibited a high discharge capacity, a low charge overpotential, and an ultralong cycle life. This work provides an alternative way of designing the soluble organic catalysts for metal-O 2  batteries.",

Recently, carbon materials have been widely used as cathode catalysts for Li\u2013O2 batteries due to their outstanding conductivity. However, side reactions are inevitable when the carbon materials are exposed to the Li2O2 product and the organic electrolytes, leading to degradation in their cycling performances. Herein, we propose a simplified strategy, which combines the template method and in situ growth approach in order to establish a three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous graphene-like carbon structure, and growth of a uniform layer of ruthenium particles on it. The as-prepared 3D ruthenium@mesoporous graphene-like carbon material delivers a reversible capacity of about 6433 mA h g\u22121 (based on the total mass of the composite) at a current density of 200 mA g\u22121, when it is used as a cathode catalyst for Li\u2013O2 batteries. Under a curtaining capacity of 500 mA h g\u22121, it exhibits an extremely low charge voltage of 3.20 V (only 240 mV higher than the thermodynamic potential) and a high discharge voltage of 2.84 V at a current density of 100 mA g\u22121.",

To achieve a long-life Li\u2013O2 battery with high round-trip efficiency, various catalysts have been extensively investigated for oxygen cathodes, especially for OER processes. Here, we designed an in situ growth of \u03b1-MnO2/RuO2 composite on a graphene nanosheet with a carbon-embedded structure as the cathode electrode for a Li\u2013O2 battery. The synergistic catalytic effect between the \u03b1-MnO2 and RuO2 has significantly improved the OER kinetics. The fabricated Li\u2013O2 battery can deliver a high reversible capacity of 2895 mAh/gcomposite with a low charge overpotential of 0.25 V (0.34 V lower than bare RuO2 cathode). The results revealed that more LiO2 intermediates formed when \u03b1-MnO2 was introduced into the RuO2 electrode during the oxidation of Li2O2. The facilitation of the initial Li extraction was confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which shows that the \u03b1-MnO2 and RuO2 interfaces can stab...",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTIt is well established that China has emerged as a major economic power, resulting from the nation\u2019s neoliberal modernization. What is less understood is the socio-cultural and educational impact of this change on public institutions. This article focuses on the education system, which is currently seen as central to delivering the nation\u2019s modernization project, particularly through suzhi jiaoyu (education for quality). More specifically, we engage with a pervasive public discourse of a boy crisis. We suggest the need critically to explore the local (national) meanings within a contemporary Chinese context of this assumed projected crisis that appears to be established as a western phenomenon. We argue that the discourse of a boy crisis can be read as a strategic move to re-inscribe an earlier discourse, that of the boy preference, that in turn is discursively linked to nation building at a time of globally inflected socio-economic transformations.",

It is argued that the commoditization of education as a form of market consumption alongside the masculinized international curriculum help shape the feminization of teachers from the Philippines. Catering to the aspirations of the country\u2019s minority ethnic Chinese, privately managed schools actively recruit trained teachers from the Philippines, many of whom are female and are perceived by students and their parents as exhibiting negative symbolic capital. In the process of their employment, they encounter occasional moments of less than complete success and challenges in their jobs. This article situates this prejudice within the cultural politics of masculinized Chinese schooling in Indonesia, while seeking to shed light on the role of Filipino work migrancy in Indonesia\u2019s formal employment sector.",

It brings to light the underlying gendered embodiment of food practices articulated through changing family relations (i.e. left behind mother - absent son). This is of particular salience within the context in which issues of ageing and care for older family members have become a major public concern in contemporary China. The paper highlights the relational accounts of food practices as care, imbued with shifting personal relations within the family, which are intertwined with social and historical transformations. In particular, it develops some critical insights on food practices that are beyond an individualu0027s reflection on self-responsibility for health. Thus, it illustrates how intergenerational family care and love are facilitated through the negotiation with everyday materiality and its practices in China.",

Situated within the pervasive national discourse of the \u2018China Dream\u2019 in which individual aspiration for a better life is advocated in line with the prosperity of the nation marked by neoliberal modernization, the paper seeks to understand how the marginalized urban working-class young men make sense of their subjectivities through a gender lens. In particular, I investigate the process of masculine identification in the young migrant fathers\u2019 narratives. It highlights the way the young men negotiate ordinary masculine ideals and familial practices of modern fatherhood, desiring a better future for the next generation. I explore how they navigate through the constraints of material inequalities (i.e. as urban working class) and the tension with their gender responsibilities/expectations within a wider familial context, in making sen...",

In order to prevent the leakage of sensitive information (such as the contact list, or private pictures) raised by inappropriate access, we propose a secure access scheme based on Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) specifically designed for mobile devices. The proposed scheme has two purposes: secure access and  losses. For secure access, we use TEE to run access authorization and verification; for  losses, we use the strategy of file slice to divide the sensitive file into multiple parts and then encrypt the file parts respectively in case of large-scale leakage. Practically, our schemeu0027s minimizing losses can be easily expanded to cloud computing by mapping one file part in our scheme to a whole file in cloud computing scenario. The theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation indicate that our scheme meets the requirement in respects of efficiency and security.",

This activity involves understanding the problem, which is essential to allow one to define a solution for it. To do this, it is important not only to understand the tasks routinely performed which is part of the problem, but more importantly to understand the domain in which the system will take place. In order to make the software development more comfortable, we present a novel architectural style directed at supporting larger grain reuse and flexible system composition in the special software domain. Under this new architecture, build a software for special domain is easy and feasible. However, one problem we have to tackle with is the data sharing among the various components. In order to make components work together well, we present asynchronous messages for components communication. This paper describes how to composite software components based on the architecture and asynchronous messages in order to eliminate the control and design process in the software development procedure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cloud computing is a novel kind of information technology that users can enjoy sundry cloud services from the shared configurable computing resources. Compared with traditional local storage, cloud storage is a more economical choice because the remote data center can replace users for data management and maintenance, which can save time and money on the series of work. However, delivering data to an unknown Cloud Service Provider (CSP) makes the integrity of data become a potential vulnerability. To solve this problem, we propose a secure identity based aggregate signatures (SIBAS) as the data integrity checking scheme which resorts Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) as the auditor to check the outsourced data in the local side. SIBAS can not only check the integrity of outsourced data, but also achieve the secure key management in TEE through Shamir\u2019s     (  t  ,  n  )     threshold scheme. To prove the security, security analysis in the random oracle model under the computational Diffie\u2013Hellman assumption shows that SIBAS can resist attacks from the adversary that chooses its messages and target identities, experimental results also show that our solution is viable and efficient in practice.",

        "abstract": "Secondary  gene amplification leads to tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The presence of the 4q12 amplicon causes the activation of downstream mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit (c-Kit) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1 (PDGFRA) signaling pathways. Therefore, in the present study, the association between the functional proteins phosphorylated c-Kit (p-c-Kit) and phosphorylated PDGFRA (p-PDGFRA) and the prognosis of ALK fusion NSCLC was investigated. Advanced stage NSCLC samples with ALK fusion were tested for their p-c-Kit and p-PDGFRA content by immunohistochemical staining, and for its association with crizotinib efficacy and the survival of the patients. Of 64 eligible ALK-positive patients with NSCLC, 30 (46.9%) were p-c-Kit-positive and 10 (15.7%) were p-PDGFRA-positive. Brain metastases were more common in ALK-positive cases that were p-PDGFRA-positive compared with those who were p-PDGFRA-negative. ALK-positive patients treated with crizotinib, who exhibited high levels of p-c-Kit had significantly lower progression-free survival times than those with low levels. In addition, the patients with high levels of p-c-Kit exhibited lower overall survival times than those with low levels. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that high levels of p-c-Kit in patients with ALK fusion was the only significant predictive factor for crizotinib efficacy and was a prognostic factor for poor overall survival time. However, no statistically significant difference was observed in the survival of patients with different p-PDGFRA levels. p-PDGFRA was more frequently expressed in the ALK-positive cases with brain metastasis. c-Kit signaling activation may be associated with poor efficacy of crizotinib and poor prognosis in advanced ALK fusion NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "We hypothesized that MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (MNK2) may contribute to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development, and serve as a new therapeutic target. Immunohistochemical staining evaluated the correlation between MNK2 expression and clinicopathological features in 367 NSCLC cancer tissues. We determined the effects of MNK2 silencing in NSCLC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. RT-PCR and western blotting was used to examine the impact of MNK2 on ERK and AKT pathways. MNK2 was overexpressed in NSCLC cell lines and tumor tissues. Patients with MNK2 overexpression had lower OS rates (P\u2009<\u20090.001). High expression of MNK2 was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P\u2009=\u20090.008). MNK2 functioned as an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in patients with NSCLC (P\u2009=\u20090.003). MNK2 down-regulation inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and reduced tumor growth and invasion in nude mice (P\u2009<\u20090.05). MNK2 enhanced phosphorylation of eIF4E, a downstream target of ERK and AKT pathways, which promoted NSCLC proliferation and invasion. We conclude that MNK2 overexpression in NSCLC is associated with proliferation, migration, invasion, and lower survival rates in patients via the phosphorylated eIF4E-mediated signaling pathway.",

Before saturation of hardness, the linear relationship between reactivation ratio and hardness could be used for assessing the thermal ageing induced hardening.

By increasing the irradiation dose from 0.5 to 3\u202fdpa, coarsening of G-phase occurred at first, followed by an obvious inverse coarsening. The segregation of Ni and Si atoms at \u03b1/\u03b1\u2032 interface due to spinodal decomposition was directly observed, which contributed to the G-phase precipitation. The inverse coarsening of G-phase was caused by irradiation recoil and could be interpreted by the cell model.",

Replacement of 2'-OH with 2'-F led to be a poor substrate for both dengue virus and human mitochondrial RNA polymerases. Instead of 2'-fluorination, the introduction of fluorine at the ribose 4'-position was found not to affect the inhibition of the dengue virus polymerase with a reduction in uptake by mitochondrial RNA polymerase. 2'-C-ethynyl-4'-F-uridine phosphoramidate prodrug displayed potent anti-dengue virus activity in the primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cell-based assay with no significant cytotoxicity in human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell lines and no mitochondrial toxicity in the cell-based assay using human prostate cancer cell lines.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT  Nucleoside or nucleotide inhibitors are a highly successful class of antivirals due to selectivity, potency, broad coverage, and high barrier to resistance. Nucleosides are the backbone of combination treatments for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and, since the FDA approval of sofosbuvir in 2013, also for hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, many promising nucleotide inhibitors have advanced to clinical trials only to be terminated due to unexpected toxicity. Here we describe the  in vitro  pharmacology of compound 1, a monophosphate prodrug of a 2\u2032-ethynyluridine developed for the treatment of HCV. Compound 1 inhibits multiple HCV genotypes  in vitro  (50% effective concentration [EC 50 ], 0.05 to 0.1 \u03bcM) with a selectivity index of u003e300 (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 ], 30 \u03bcM in MT-4 cells). The active triphosphate metabolite of compound 1, compound 2, does not inhibit human \u03b1, \u03b2, or \u03b3 DNA polymerases but was a substrate for incorporation by the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT). In dog, the oral administration of compound 1 resulted in elevated serum liver enzymes and microscopic changes in the liver. Transmission electron microscopy showed significant mitochondrial swelling and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Gene expression analysis revealed dose-proportional gene signature changes linked to loss of hepatic function and increased mitochondrial dysfunction. The potential of  in vivo  toxicity through mitochondrial polymerase incorporation by nucleoside analogs has been previously shown. This study shows that even moderate levels of nucleotide analog incorporation by POLRMT increase the risk of  in vivo  mitochondrial dysfunction. Based on these results, further development of compound 1 as an anti-HCV compound was terminated.",

Expression of MBLs confers resistance in Gram-negative bacteria to all classes of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of monobactams, which are intrinsically stable to MBLs. However, existing first generation monobactam drugs like aztreonam have limited clinical utility against MBL-expressing strains because they are impacted by serine \u03b2-lactamases (SBLs), which are often co-expressed in clinical isolates. Here, we optimized novel monobactams for stability against SBLs, which led to the identification of LYS228 (compound 31). LYS228 is potent in the presence of all classes of \u03b2-lactamases and shows potent activity against carbapenem-resistant isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).",

Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems have a high power density, whereas battery energy storage systems (BESSs) provide a high energy density. The significant contribution of this paper is the proposal of hierarchical control strategies for an HESS composed of an SMES system and a BESS. Mathematical models and port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) models of the HESS are established. At the device level, a novel HESS control strategy based on the PCH models is proposed to improve its output performance. At the system level, a multilevel power allocation method based on empirical mode decomposition, Fuzzy control and advanced control is proposed to achieve an efficient grid connection for a wind farm; the grid connection considers the real-time and future state of charge of the SMES system and BESS. The effectiveness of the proposed strategies are verified through simulation studies.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel nonlinear control strategy for a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) system during network unbalance. Grid voltage unbalances tend to substantially degrade the operation of a SMES system; conventional control methods cannot completely address this issue. In this paper, three selectable control targets for the SMES are identified according to the working principle of the SMES under an unbalanced voltage condition to reduce the impacts of second harmonics in output power, output reactive power, and grid-side current. Next, the port-controlled Hamiltonian models of the SMES are established, and the positive- and negative-sequence interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (PBC) strategies are proposed accordingly. Simulation results show that the PBC has stronger robustness in both steady and dynamic states compared with the conventional proportional integral method, which effectively suppresses the oscillations caused by the unbalanced voltage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) has been widely used to stabilize the power fluctuations of wind farms to achieve efficient grid connections. However, conventional converters can rarely satisfy the high power quality requirements of a power grid. Compared to other convertors, a three-level T-type converter (3LT 2 C) can improve the output performance and operating efficiency of a system and reduce the voltage stress and conduction loss of power switches. Therefore, the 3LT 2 C has broad application prospects for electric power storage. A precise control strategy is also necessary for the practical application of an SMES system, which has significant nonlinear dynamic characteristics. Energy-shaping (ES) control is a nonlinear control method that is based on the theoretical design of interconnection and damping assignment (IDA), which considers both the nonlinear nature of a system and the energy perspective. This study proposes an ES control strategy for an SMES system based on a 3LT 2 C. Mathematical models and port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) models of the SMES are established. The ES control strategy of the SMES system is designed based on a feedback interconnection structure through analysis of the novel SMES topology. Finally, the effectiveness of the control strategy and the proposed topology are verified through simulations.",

        "abstract": ". The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) in patients with clinically node-negative conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (cN CPTC). . A total of 190 cN CPTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy with prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) in the Department of General Surgery at Guangdong General Hospital between March 2014 and December 2015 were assessed retrospectively. The relations of CLNM with clinicopathologic characteristics of cN CPTC were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. . The incidence of CLNM in patients with cN CPTC was 63.2% (120 of 190 cases). Univariate analysis showed that age <45 years ( = 0.000), tumor size >2\u2009cm ( = 0.009), multifocality ( = 0.001), and bilaterality ( = 0.000) were significantly associated with the increased incidence of CLNM in cN CPTC. No significant correlations were found between CLNM and other variables such as gender ( = 0.150), capsular invasion ( = 0.973), extrathyroidal invasion ( = 0.616), and lymphadenectomy ( = 0.062). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age <45 years ( = 0.000), tumor size >2\u2009cm ( = 0.025), and bilaterality ( = 0.000) were independent risk factors of CLNM in patients with cN CPTC. . Metastatic disease to central compartment lymph nodes is prevalent in patients with cN CPTC. Age <45 years, tumor size >2\u2009cm, and bilaterality are independent risk factors of CLNM, which allow for selective CND in patients with cN CPTC.",

In our presented framework, a novel remapping rule for the FQPSK modulation in the PNC system is proposed to make a better bit error rate (BER) performance. Moreover, a joint demapping-and-demodulation scheme based on Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is employed to recover the data bits with a low computational burden.

        "abstract": "Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) architecture is expected to play a promising role in future deep space missions. Scientific data interactions over space DTN involve several hops inevitable, since simultaneous and direct connectivity among all intermediate nodes are becoming more difficult in space scenarios. Therefore, the characteristics and capabilities of the node storage are vital factors for the quality of data delivery over space DTN. This paper proposes an analytical framework based on multi-dimension Markov chain to evaluate the dynamic on storage of intermediate nodes in space DTN. According to the proposed framework, we develop a delay model and consequently a success probability model for bundles delivery over space DTN, both of which are dependent closely on the sojourn time in node storages. The numerical results show that: a) dividing source-file data into bigger bundles can bring longer high-storage-occupancy time on intermediary nodes; b) the shorter storage occupation time of node is more susceptible to the bundle sizes than to LTP segment sizes. c) the delivery success probability of the bundles is more dependent on smaller DTN bundles than on LTP segment sizes given the constrains on Time-to-live of bundles in space missions.",

We introduce a new algorithm called the selective linearization method, which iteratively linearizes all but one of the functions and employs simple proximal steps. The algorithm is a form of multiple operator splitting in which the order of processing partial functions is not fixed, but rather determined in the course of calculations. Global convergence is proved and estimates of the convergence rate are derived. Specifically, the number of iterations needed to achieve solution accuracy $varepsilon$ is of order $mathcal{O}(ln(1/varepsilon)/varepsilon)$.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Vertical position controllability with EAST vertical instability fast control system in current mode is analyzed using Tokamak Simulation Code (TSC). TSC is a non-linear two-dimensional axisymmetric free boundary simulation code. Maxwell\u2019s and MHD equations are used to describe the evolution of magnetic field in a rectangular domain for the plasma. In 2016, the model for VDE free drift and control has been benchmarked against experiments. In this paper, the power supply model for fast VDE control is extended to one with limited maximum control current. VDE controllability with the present system capability is studied. The maximum controllable displacement      d  Z    m  a  x      is numerically analyzed, for both ordinary experimental discharge and equilibria with typical     \u03b2  p     and     l  i     in EAST. It is found that      d  Z    m  a  x      inversely grows with     \u03b2  p     and     l  i    . Rigorous conditions of     l  i   =  1  ,     \u03b2  p     0.3    or     \u03b2  p   =  0.5  ,     l  i     0.8    are required for      d  Z    m  a  x      reaching the safe control level. For operation safety, system capability enhancement is needed. Effects of system delay time, the maximum control current and system current ramp time on VDE controllability are discussed.",

        "title": "Condition assessment of shield tunnel using a new indicator: The tunnel serviceability index",
        "abstract": "Abstract   The condition assessment of shield tunnels is one of the key issues in the structural maintenance during the service life of the tunnel. Traditionally, the shield tunnel condition has been graded based on certain types of tunnel distresses, such as convergence deformation, differential settlement, cracks, and water leakage. However, the overall condition of the tunnel cannot be so easily assessed, as it often depends on experts\u2019 decisions and evaluations. This paper proposes a comprehensive tunnel serviceability index (TSI) to evaluate the overall condition of a shield tunnel in soft ground. The TSI is a mathematical combination of measurable tunnel distresses that can be obtained by employing the following steps: (1) select the types of tunnel distresses to be included in the TSI, (2) prepare the tunnel samples with distresses, (3) have experts rate the tunnel serviceability, and (4) regress the TSI formula using the partial least squares (PLS) method. The TSI formula can then be applied to evaluate the serviceability of tunnels that are similar to the tunnel samples in step (2). Metro shield tunnels in Shanghai\u2019s soft ground are selected for a case study. Six common distresses, namely, relative settlement, differential settlement, convergence deformation, water leakage, cracking, and spalling, are selected for inclusion in the TSI. Tunnel serviceability ratings of 40 samples were conducted to regress the TSI formula. The TSI formula reveals that relative settlement, differential settlement, convergence deformation and water leakage are the four significant variables that impact the serviceability of Shanghai\u2019s metro shield tunnel with loading factors of \u22120.62, \u22120.13, \u22120.25 and \u22120.19, respectively. Cracking and spalling are two weak indicators with loading factors of \u22120.06 and \u22120.03, respectively. These conclusions, in general, are consistent with the maintenance experiences of the Shanghai metro group.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To investigate the inherent uncertain and dynamic deterioration of metro shield tunnels in operation, the Bayesian ordered probit model, a data mining method, was used in this study. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, the uncertainty in parameter estimation was significantly reduced, and the confidence in the results was improved. The effects of influencing variables on the deterioration process were evaluated. It was found that the tunnel sections with greater burial depths were more likely to deteriorate than the shallow ones. Crossing below a river or near a station or cross passage accelerated the deterioration rate. The deterioration probability increased as the tunnel became older. Finally, the model was applied to a tunnel section. It was shown that the probability of the best state decreased while that of the worst state increased with age. For states between the best and the worst, the probability would first increase, reach a peak, and then decrease. This study found that the ordered probit model with MCMC was a valuable probabilistic method for performance prediction, which is crucial for cost-effective decision-making in future work.",

        "abstract": "Traffic monitoring system empowers cloud server and drivers to collect real-time driving information and acquire traffic conditions. However, drivers are more interested in local traffic, and sending driving reports to a remote cloud server consumes a heavy bandwidth and incurs an increased response delay. Recently, fog computing is introduced to provide location-sensitive and latency-aware local data management in vehicular crowdsensing, but it also raises new privacy concerns because driversu0027 information could be disclosed. Although these messages are encrypted before transmission, malicious drivers can upload false reports to sabotage the systems, and filtering out false encrypted reports remains a challenging issue. To address the problems, we define a new security model and propose a privacy preserving traffic monitoring scheme. Specifically, we utilize short group signature to authenticate drivers in a conditionally anonymous way, adopt a range query technique to acquire driving information in a privacy-preserving way, and integrate it to the construction of a weighted proximity graph at each fog node through a WiFi challenge handshake to filter out false reports. Moreover, we use variant Bloom filters to achieve fast traffic conditions storage and retrieval. Finally, we prove the security and privacy, evaluate the performance with real-world cloud servers.",
