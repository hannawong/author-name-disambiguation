        "abstract": "The purpose of this clinical paper is to explore the therapeutic effects, healing times, adverse effects, and maintenance periods of using a CO2 fractional laser in the treatment of photoaging in Asian skin.One fractional CO2 laser procedure was performed on the full face in 56 patients with photoaging. Based on the Dover scoring system, we evaluated the degree of skin aging before treatment and at one-month post laser and at five years post laser therapy in 30 of the patients. Statistical analysis was performed by the Wilcoxon's method.Thirty of the treated patients have had follow-up for 5 years at this time. The photoaging scores in these thirty patients were significantly changed (P < 0.01) at one month, one year, and five years after the fractional laser treatment, as compared with their baseline. Adverse events seen during this analysis were found to be minimal and not of clinical significance.Fractional CO2 laser resurfacing in the treatment of photoaging in Asians is a useful modality with results, for the first time, being shown to have continued efficacy for up to 5 years.",

Methods: The experiment was conducted in the Central Laboratory of Xiangya Hospital from January to March 2004. Cicatricles of burnt patients 3-6 months after healed were taken as subjects. Scar fibroblasts isolately cultured in vitro were inspected with immunohistochemical staining and Western Blot for expression of HIF-1\u03b1 24 hours after cultured with the volume fraction of theoxygen concentration of 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.015. Results: 1 Immunohistochemical staining: There were expressions of HIF-1\u03b1 in cellular nucleus and cell-substance, signal intensities of expression of HIF-1\u03b1 under the volume fraction of theoxygen concentration of 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.015 were respectively 47.50\u00b19.29, 96.00\u00b118.29, 209.17 \u00b119.64 and 263.83 \u00b113.24, differences of comparion in different concentrations were significant (F=261.01, P < 0.01). Partial expressions of HIF-1\u03b1 were weakly positive (WP) in 0.2 O 2 and were fundamentally in WP in 0.1 O 2. While expressions of HIF-1\u03b1 in 0.5 O 2 were mainly positive and that in 0.015 O 2 were fundamentally positive. 2 Western Blot inspection: Relative amounts of protein expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.015 O 2 were respectively 0.02,0.26, 0.39 and 0.97, which were in increasing tendency and higher than that in 0.2 O 2. Conclusion: With the decreasing of O 2 concentration, expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in scar fibroblasts is strengthened gradually. Expressive intensity of HIF-1\u03b1 can indirectly reflect the concentration of O 2 in scar tissues.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There has been some progress in clinical application of fractional CO2 laser for treatment of facial photoaging. However, little is known about the change law of epidermal stem cells during wound healing process after treatment with fractional CO2laser in a model of skin photoaging. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the quantity and distribution of epidermal stem cells during wound healing process after treatment with fractional CO2 laser in a mouse model of skin photoaging. METHODS: Ten Kunming mouse models of skin photoaging developed by exposure to ultraviolet radiation were treated with fractional CO2 laser (Deep FX). Wound healing was monitored and samples were harvested for determination of keratin 19 ad P63 expression by immunohistochemical staining before and 1, 3, 7 and 15 days after fractional CO2 laser treatment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The wounds almost healed at 15 days after treatment. Compared to before and day 1 treatment, Keratin 19 and P63 expression on day 3 were significantly increased, and keratin 19- and P63-positive cells were distributed in larger areas. Compared to days 1 and 3 of treatment, keratin 19- and P63-positive cells were significantly higher in quality and peaked on day 7 of treatment, and they were disorderly arranged in each epidermal layer. On day 15 of treatment, keratin 19- and P63-positive cells decreased in number and only accumulated in epidermal basal lamina and hair follicle eminence, and there was no significant difference in keratin 19- and P63-positive expression as compared with before and day 1 of treatment. These findings suggest that epidermal stem cells participate in the repair progress of skin photoaging in mice receiving fractional CO2 laser treatment and may play an important role in this process.",

        "abstract": "Few reports exist on effective methods of evaluating the effects and selecting indications for the treatment of improving facial morphology by masseteric injection of botulinum toxin type A. The method for selecting indicative factors, as determined by the change of masseteric area volume at a standard frontal view when tightly clenching teeth, was used in this study. Patients with varying masseteric area volume were randomly enrolled. Bilateral masseteric muscles were treated with multi-point percutaneous intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin type A, 30-50 u for each side. Changes in facial appearance and satisfaction of patients were observed and standard frontal view photographs were taken pre-treatment and 2-3 months post-treatment. Following this, the anterior facial height(FH), bizygomatic facial width (FWz) and intergonial width (FWg) were measured from the photographs. The indices of FH/FWz and FWg/FWz were calculated and analysed. The results showed that the volume of masseteric area was reduced and the facial morphology was improved at 2-4 weeks post-injection, with maximum reduction at 2-3 months post-injection. All of the 32 patients were satisfied with the clinical effects. The pre-treatment and post-treatment values of FH/FWz were 0.8309\u00b10.0423 and 0.8331\u00b10.0382, respectively, and FWg/FWz values were 0.8281\u00b10.0209 and 0.7925\u00b10.0206 (P<0.01), respectively. In conclusion, the appropriateness of masseteric injection of botulinum toxin type A for improving facial morphology can be determined by the changes in masseteric area volume at a standard frontal view of tightly clenched teeth. In addition, the facial index of FWg/FWz can be used to evaluate the treatment.",

After complete dissection of the cartilage adhesion, the cartilage was reshaped by suture to restore its appearance. Then the temporal triangular rotation flap was transferred to cover the wound.No hematoma, infection or flap necrosis happened. The follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 1 year, with an average of (6.88 +/- 2.85) months. The ear appearance kept stable with no recurrence and inconspicuous scar. Satisfactory result was achieved.Temporal rotation flap combined with cartilage plasty is a good option for correction of mild or moderate cryptotia.",

OBJECTIVE:To investigate the effect of ultrapulse CO2 fractional laser on the treatment of superficial scars in rabbit ear and to explore mechanism of wound in situ regeneration and repair. METHODS:The superficial scars in rabbit ear were induced with ultrapulse CO2 fractional laser, then traditional iodophor treatment and moist exposed burn ointment treatment methods were used for repairing the wound. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:The wound healing time of moist exposed burn ointment group was shorter than that of iodophor group (P < 0.01). The epidermal stem cells emerged after the superficial scars induced with ultrapulse CO2 fractional laser, and the expression of cytokeratin 19 and P63 protein was observed after induced for 24 hours. The number of cytokeratin 19 and P63 protein in the moist exposed burn ointment was increased after induced for 4 days and reached peak at 7 days and then decreased at 14 days. While the number of cytokeratin 19 and P63 protein in the iodophor group was increased after induced for 4 days, and then decreased after induced for 7 and 14 days. The expression of cytokeratin 19 and P63 protein in the moist exposed burn ointment group was significantly higher than that in the iodophor group (P < 0.05). Ultrapulse CO2 fractional laser combined with moist exposed burn ointment for the treatment of superficial scar in rabbit ear can better activate and protect the epidermal stem cells, and promote wound repair and in situ regeneration.",

The elemental analyses, IR, UV-vis, atomic absorption spectroscopy, TG-DSC, (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR data were used to characterize the structure of the complex. The cytotoxicity of the complex against the human cancer cell lines HepG2, HeLa, MCF-7, B16, and MDA-MB-231 was tested by the MTT assay and flow cytometry. Emodin was coordinated with Mn(II) through the 9-C=O and 1-OH, and the general formula of the complex was Mn(II) (emodin)2\u00b72H2O. In studies of the cytotoxicity, the complex exhibited significant activity, and the IC50 values of the complex against five cancer cell lines improved approximately three-fold compared with those of emodin. The complex could induce cell morphological changes, decrease the percentage of viability, and induce G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. The coordination of emodin with Mn(II) can improve its anticancer activity, and the complex Mn(II) (emodin)2\u00b72H2O could be studied further as a promising anticancer drug.",

        "abstract": "Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb is used as the tonic for asthenia and fatigue in China. Considering that the energizing effect might be correlated with antioxidant properties, we investigated the antioxidant activities of aqueous extract (AE) from Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb by assessing radical-scavenging and anti-lipid-peroxidation abilities. We found that AE shows a moderate antioxidant activity to scavenge DPPH*, O2(-)* and *OH and inhibit beta-carotene bleaching with IC(50) values of 13.0, 33.2, 351, and 11.9 microg/ml, respectively, while its AcOEt-soluble fraction (ESF) and BuOH soluble fraction (BSF) exhibit remarkable efficiencies. The ESF's IC(50) values of scavenging DPPH*, O2(-)*, and *OH, and inhibiting beta-carotene bleaching are 5.6, 5.8, 171, and 7.6 mircog/ml, respectively, and those of BSF are 7.5, 8.4, 82.0, and 6.2 microg/ml, respectively. In addition, we found that there is a significant correlation between total phenol content and the antioxidant activity determined by O2(-)* and *OH scavenging, and beta-carotene-bleaching assays. Furthermore, HPLC analysis revealed the presence of quercetin, hyperoside, quercitrin, taxifoliol, luteolin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and rutin in Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. Thus, we suggest that the extracts from Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb, could be considered as natural antioxidant sources and dietary nutritional supplements to prevent oxidation-related diseases.",

In this current study, \u03b2-ecdysterone (1) and three pennogenin steroidal saponins (2-4) were isolated from the EtOH extract of Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis, and then tested for their antitumor and antifungal activities. Spectroscopic data was used to confirm their structures. Their antitumor properties were determined by using an MTT assay in addition to ethidium bromide and acridine orange staining techniques. Compounds 2, 3 and 4 exhibited significant anti-proliferation activities against HepG2 cells, with IC50 values of 13.5 \u03bcM, 9.7 \u03bcM and 11.6 \u03bcM respectively, obtained following 48 h treatment. Furthermore, we found these pennogenin steroidal saponins could induce HepG2 cells apoptosis at a concentration of 20 \u03bcM after 48 h treatment. Compounds 2, 3 and 4 were confirmed to exhibit moderate antifungal activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of compounds 2, 3 and 4 against saccharomyces cerevisiae hansen were 2.5 mg.mL(-1), 0.6 mg.mL(-1) and 0.6 mg.mL(-1), respectively. The MIC of compounds 2, 3 and 4 against Candida albicans were 1.2 mgmL(-1), 0.6 mg.mL(-1) and 1.2 mg.mL(-1), respectively. The analysis of the bioactivity-structure relationship shows that the sugar moiety plays a critical role in the activity of steroid moiety.

Methods: MTT, fluorescence stain, flow cytometric analysis and immunocytochemistry stain were carried out. Results: Quercetin had a significant inhibition on growth and proliferation of A549 cell in a concentration-and time-dependent manner. Evidence was provided that apoptosis occurred in A549 cells treated with quercetin using fluorescence microscopy. Quercetin arrested A549 cells at the G 0/G 1 phase by FCM analyses. Expression of survivin and Bcl-2 protein were decreased, and activity of caspase-3 were enhanced. Conclusion: Quercetin could induce apoptosis of A549 cells. The arrested cell cycle and the down-regulation of survivin and Bcl-2 protein could activate caspase-3 resulting in cells apoptosis, which may contribute to the apoptosis mechanisms. The down-regulated survivin and Bcl-2 may play an important role in A549 cells apoptosis induced by quercetin.",

        "abstract": "Agrimonia Pilosa Ledeb (APL), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported a variety of biological activities, including treating T2DM.Triterpenoid compound (TC) was collected from APL. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of TC on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and genes related to differentiation and IR.Column chromatography was used to collect TC from ALP. 3T3-L1 cell differentiation was induced typically in the presence of various concentrations of TC or pioglitazone. Oil red O staining and measurement of intracellular TG content were performed on the seventh day of differentiation. Then quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was used to test the expressions of three transcription factors (PPAR\u03b3, CCAAT enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP-\u03b1), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1)) and the target genes of PPAR\u03b3 including glucose transporter (GLUT4), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fat acid binding protein (AP2), and adiponectin in 3T3-L1 cells.At the concentration of 5, 25 and 125 \u03bcg/mL, TC significantly promoted triglyceride accumulation. Further study showed that TC could promote the expression of PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b1 and ADD1/SREBP1 significantly at 125 \u03bcg/mL. As for downstream genes controlled by PPAR\u03b3, TC at 25 and 125 \u03bcg/mL could significantly promote the expression of GLUT4 and adiponectin. However, the expression of aP2 related to lipid metabolism and adiposity in the TC group was significantly lower than that in the pioglitazone group.TC could promote preadipocytes differentiation through activating PPAR\u03b3 and downstream controlled genes. TC has the ideal insulin sensitization with lower adipogenic action than classical TZDs in vitro. So TC from Agrimonia Pilosa Ledeb has a good prospect as a natural drug for IR and T2DM.",

The complex successfully promotes the cleavage of plasmid DNA, producing single and double DNA strand breaks. The amount of conversion of supercoiled form (SC) of plasmid to the nicked circular form (NC) depends on the concentration of the complex as well as the duration of incubation of the complex with DNA. The rate of conversion of SC to NC is 1.68x10(-4) s(-1) at pH 7.2 in the presence of 100 microM of the complex. The hydrolytic cleavage of DNA by the complex is supported by the evidence from free radical quenching, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay, and T4 ligase ligation.",

Clostridium absonum 7\u03b1-HSDH (Ca 7\u03b1-HSDH) was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The function of carboxyterminal (C-terminal) and Arg38 of Ca 7\u03b1-HSDH was investigated through truncations and site-directed mutagenesis, respectively. When 2 and 6 amino acids of C-terminal were removed, the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of Ca 7\u03b1-HSDH remained 19.1% and 2.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the activity could not be detected after 8, 14 and 17 amino acids were deleted. No activity could be detected with coenzyme either NADP(+) or NAD(+) after replacement of arginine at position 38 by aspartic acid. The metal ions Mg(2+) (50 mM), Na(+) (200 mM) and K(+) (500 mM) could maximally improve the activity of Ca 7\u03b1-HSDH by 61.4%, 64.7% and 105.7%, respectively. The activity had no significant change after incubation at 4 or 25 \u00b0C for 108 h, but decreased dramatically at 37 \u00b0C. Our study confirmed that C-terminal and Arg38 were essential for the catalytic function of Ca 7\u03b1-HSDH and the enzyme activity can be improved by metal ions.",

        "title": "Threshold stress intensity factor for delayed hydride cracking of a recrystallized N18 alloy plate along the rolling direction",
        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to obtain the threshold stress intensity factor, K IH , for an initiation of delayed hydride cracking in a recrystallized N18 (Zr\u2013Sn\u2013Nb\u2013Fe\u2013Cr) alloy plate which was manufactured in China, gaseously charged with 60 ppm of hydrogen by weight. By using both the load increasing method and load drop method, the K IH \u2019s along the rolling direction were investigated over a temperature range of 150\u2013255 \u00b0C. The results showed that K IH along the rolling direction was found to be higher in the load increasing method than that in the load drop method. In the load increasing method, K IH \u2019s of the N18 alloy plate appeared to be in the range of 31 \u2013 32.5 MPa m , and K IH in the load drop method appeared to be in the range of 27.5 \u2013 28.6 MPa m . This means that the N18 alloy plate has high tolerance for DHC initiation along the rolling direction. The texture of a N18 alloy plate was investigated using an X-ray diffraction and the K IH was discussed based on texture and analytically as a function of the tilting angle of hydride habit planes to the cracking plane. 1 Introduction Zirconium alloys has been successfully used as cladding and structural materials in light and heavy water nuclear reactors for many years because of their low capture cross-section for thermal neutrons and good mechanical and corrosion properties. During their service a part of hydrogen produced through the corrosion reaction of Zr with hot coolant is absorbed by materials. Hydrogen in excess of solid solubility precipitates out as hydride phase of platelet morphology and could make the host matrix brittle. Hydride induced embrittlement significantly influences the in-service performance of the Zr-alloys components. Delayed hydride cracking (DHC) is a localized form of hydride embrittlement, which in the presence of a tensile stress-field manifests itself as a sub-critical crack growth process. Consequently, hydrogen atoms in the solid solution will diffuse into the region that is ahead of the crack tip when it is subjected to a triaxial state of stress, which may lower the chemical potential of hydrogen in the region ahead of the crack tip. Once the hydrogen concentration in this region reaches (or exceeds) the terminal solid solubility for precipitation (TSSP), hydrides will start to form and grow. When the hydrides at the crack tip reach a critical size, the main crack will propagate through this hydrided region. The crack front finally is arrested at the end of the hydrided region by the ductile zirconium matrix, and the whole process repeats itself [1\u20134] . DHC was the cause of leakage in some Zr\u20132.5Nb pressure tubes of CANDU plants at Pickering and Bruce [5] and Russian RMBK reactors at Kursk and Chernobyl [6] and may contribute to the large axial splits experienced in the Zircaloy fuel cladding in light water reactors [7,8] . The threshold stress intensity factor ( K IH ) is an important parameter for an evaluation of the integrity of the Zr-alloy components of a reactor, because it can be used to determine whether stable DHC crack growths start [3,9] . Although the threshold stress intensity factor has been studied for a long time, most of them were performed on Zr\u20132.5Nb and Zircaloy-2 [1\u20136,9\u201313] and few literatures were found on the subject of K IH in Zircaloy-4 [4,14] . Almost no information was found on Zr\u2013Sn\u2013Nb alloy. Currently, several new Zr-based alloys have been developed from the point of view of enhancement of corrosion resistance and hydrogen pickup properties as a substitute for Zircaloy [15\u201317] . In China, N18 (Zr\u2013Sn\u2013Nb\u2013Fe\u2013Cr) alloy have been developed on the base of Zr\u2013Sn and Zr\u2013Nb systems to meet the requirements of higher fuel burn-up [18\u201321] . Up to now, we have not any DHC data for a N18 alloy plate, moreover, anisotropic DHC properties (including K IH ) of Zr\u2013Nb alloys and Zircaloy-2 were found [22,23,33] . Therefore, systematic DHC properties data along all directions for a N18 alloy plate are needed. And based on the systematic DHC properties data we will establish a database related to DHC of the N18 alloy plate. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the threshold stress intensity factor for delayed hydride cracking of a N18 alloy plate along the rolling direction for the first time. The present study will contribute to the establishment of a database related to DHC of the N18 alloy plate and it is a part of the systematic DHC behaviors for the N18 alloy plate. In the present investigation, by using both the load increasing method (LIM) and load drop method (LDM), we determined K IH along the rolling direction over a temperature range of 150\u2013255 \u00b0C. The fracture surfaces were examined by using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). 2 Experimental procedures 2.1 Specimen preparation The vacuum consumable arc remelting method was employed for producing 500 kg ingot of Zr\u2013Sn\u2013Nb\u2013Fe\u2013Cr zirconium alloy with the chemical compositions (in wt.%): Sn: 1.05; Nb: 0.27; Fe: 0.35; Cr: 0.1; O: 0.09; Zr: balance. \u03b2-Quenching treatment in water was conducted to homogenize the composition within the ingot after being hot forged. Then the ingot was made into plates of about 4.6 mm thickness through various rolling and intermediate annealing (600 \u00b0C) processes. The final annealing was conducted at 580 \u00b0C for 2 h in vacuum [18,24,25] . The equiaxed grains were measured to be about 10 \u03bcm in diameter. The room temperature yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of N18 alloy plate along the rolling direction was 419 and 535 MPa respectively [25] . The texture of N18 alloy plate was confirmed by (0 0 0 2) pole figure measurement using an X-ray diffraction (XRD). The N18 alloy plate presents a bimodal distribution of the intensity maxima, and it exhibits a strong texture with a maximum (0 0 0 2) pole density at \u223c25\u00b0 toward the transverse direction from the plate normal, as shown in Fig. 1 where the rolling and transverse directions are denoted as RD and TD, respectively. The basal pole components of the N18 alloy plate are shown in Table 1 . The basal pole components in the rolling direction and transverse direction are lower than that along plate normal obviously. Seventeen millimeter compact tension (CT) specimens shown in Fig. 2 which were manufactured in accordance with ASTM standard test method (E-399) were used to determine K IH along the rolling direction. The CT specimens were charged with hydrogen using a gaseously hydrided method and a diffusion annealing treatment was performed to obtain about 60 ppm of hydrogen throughout the specimens. More details of the hydrogen charging procedure are reported elsewhere [25] . The real hydrogen content of the specimen was obtained by averaging a set of two data measured with a LECO RH 600 hydrogen analyzer. The CT specimens were then fatigue pre-cracked to obtain a sharp crack tip and uniform crack front at room temperature, an initial crack length of about 1.7 mm. The stress intensity factor, K I , was calculated using the following Eqs. (1) and (2) from ASTM E-399: (1) K I = P Q / ( B \u00d7 W 1 / 2 ) \u00d7 f ( a / W ) (2) f ( a / W ) = ( 2 + a / W ) [ 0.886 + 4.64 ( a / W ) - 13.32 ( a / W ) 2 + 14.72 ( a / W ) 3 - 5.6 ( a / W ) 4 ] / ( 1 - a / W ) 3 / 2 where P Q = applied load (N), B = specimen thickness (m), W = specimen width (m), a = crack length (m). The hydride morphology was observed with an optical microscopy. The typical metallography of hydride structure on the rolling-normal plane and transverse-normal plane were depicted in Fig. 3 a and b, revealed that hydrides (dark lines) were appeared as a line segment and uniformly distributed. 2.2 Delayed hydride cracking tests A CSS-250 creep testing machine was used to carry out DHC tests. The equipment consisted of single arm lever type loading system fitted with a resistance heated two zone furnace to provide temperature control within 1 \u00b0C of the set temperature. The lever arm ratio of the loading system was 1:10. The temperature of the specimen was monitored using K-type thermocouple spot welded to the surface of the specimen within 2 mm of the fatigue pre-crack tip. The DHC crack growth was monitored using direct current potential drop (DCPD) technique using a DC constant-current power source [12] . The temperature output from the thermocouple and DCPD signal were continuously recorded every minute using computer data acquisition system [25] . A schematic diagram of thermal cycle which the CT specimens experienced in the DHC tests was shown in Fig. 4 . The CT specimens were heated to a peak temperature at a heating rate between 2\u20133 \u00b0C/min, held at peak temperature for 90 min and cooled down to the test temperature followed by applying a load 30 min after attaining the test temperature. The peak temperature was set at 330 \u00b0C, which was about 50 \u00b0C higher than the terminal solid solubility for dissolution (TSSD) temperature to dissolve all the charged hydrogen in the zirconium matrix. In the LIM, the initial applied load, which corresponded to a stress intensity factor (SIF) of 20 MPa m , was increased step-wise to ensure increase in SIF of 1 MPa m when the crack did not grow within 24 h. In contrast, in the LDM, the first step of tests in the investigation was performed at the highest applied load, which corresponded to an SIF of 35 MPa m . DHC crack growth under constant load was monitored by DCPD technique and after obtaining a crack growth of some finite distance (of the order of 100 \u03bcm), the load was reduced to ensure decrease in SIF of 1 MPa m (after each successive load drop, the updated value of crack length and geometrical factor was used to compute K I ) and the same sequence was repeated till a K I was reached which produced insignificant change in DCPD signal as a function of time for 24 h. The final K IH was calculated using the final crack length after breaking the specimen. Duplicate tests were carried out at each test temperature to ensure the reliability of the K IH data. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 K IH along the rolling direction with both LIM and LDM Fig. 5 a shows a typical plot of DCPD output and specimen temperature as a function of time during the LIM testing carried out at 205 \u00b0C corresponding to one constant load. As can be seen in this figure, for all the tests the specimen temperatures remained constant throughout the DHC testing. The slope of DCPD versus time curve increased with time. These indicated that the DHC crack growth rate was increased slightly with an increasing DHC crack length. A typical plot of DCPD output and load as a function of time during the LIM testing carried out 205 \u00b0C was depicted in Fig. 5 b, revealed that significant incubation period of DHC were observed. Fig. 6 a shows changes of DCPD output and specimen temperature with time during the LDM testing carried out 245 \u00b0C corresponding to variation of load. A plot of load drop step and the corresponding change in DCPD output with time carried out 245 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 6 b. In the LDM, the slope of DCPD versus time curve decreased with a decreasing load, which indicated that the DHC crack growth rate was decreased with a decreasing the applied K I . The threshold stress intensity factor K IH were determined for the N18 alloy plate specimens by plotting the measured crack velocity as a function of stress intensity factor as shown in Fig. 7 . As expected, the stress intensity factor ( K I ) > 29 MPa m , DHC velocity is practically independent of the former and below this value DHC velocity decreases with decrease in K I . The threshold stress intensity factors, K IH \u2019s of the N18 alloy plate along the rolling direction obtained using both LIM and LDM were plotted in Fig. 8 . K IH of the N18 alloy plate along the rolling direction was found to be higher in the LIM than that in the LDM over a temperature range of 150\u2013255 \u00b0C. In the LIM, K IH \u2019s of the N18 alloy plate appeared to be in the range of 31 \u2013 32.5 MPa m , and K IH in the LDM appeared to be in the range of 27.5 \u2013 28.6 MPa m . A higher K IH in the LIM, shown in Fig. 8 , may be partly due to a different crack tip size contingent on the loading modes. It should be noted that the initial crack, growing in the LIM, is a pre-fatigue crack that was formed at a larger K I of 32.5 MPa m but the grown crack in the LDM is a DHC crack that must have been created at a lower K I of around 28.5 MPa m . Considering that the DHC crack grows at a lower K I than the fatigue crack, the tip of the DHC crack would be sharper than that of the fatigue crack, leading to a lower level of stress ahead of the tip of the fatigue crack [23,26] . The threshold behavior for N18 alloy plate revealed that K IH \u2019s of the N18 alloy plate remained constant in a temperature range of 150\u2013255 \u00b0C in the LDM while they slightly decreased with an increasing temperature in the LIM. This is due to the different temperature dependencies of K IH contingent upon the loading modes: A slightly decrease of K IH with increasing temperature in the LIM is likely due to the increased number of twins at a temperature range of 150\u2013255 \u00b0C. The higher the number of twins, the easier cracking of the hydrides and the lower K IH in the LIM becomes [9] . This strong dependency of K IH on the number of twins seems to arise from some difficulties in cracking of the grown hydrides by twins part of which are suppressed by prior creep deformation and thereby causing a blunt crack tip only in the load-increasing mode. By contrast, in the LDM, the hydrides which precipitate in the plastic zone grow long enough to exceed critical hydride length even without creep, and the crack front is very sharp, causing the hydrides to fracture more easily by the twin\u2013hydride interactions. Thus, the number of twins is not so critical in determining K IH as long as there are a few twins for inducing cracking of the hydrides, leading to a constant K IH independent of the number of the twins over a temperature range of 150\u2013255 \u00b0C. It is noted that the K IH values along the rolling direction of a recrystallized N18 alloy plate with both LIM and LDM in this study are higher than the previous data. This means that the N18 alloy plate along the rolling direction is not susceptible to cracking by DHC. Many studies [27\u201333] focused on the K IH in various Zr-alloys, and confirmed that K IH is practically independent of material strength and the minimum alloying elements in zirconium. However, because of the anisotropy of hexagonal \u03b1-zirconium, a texture is formed upon plastic deformation during the fabrication process, which will effect hydride precipitation. Since the DHC crack grows by fracturing of hydrides, an initiation of the DHC crack would depend strongly on the orientation of the hydride habit plane where the hydrides can precipitate preferentially. In other words, if the hydride habit plane is parallel to the cracking plane, the DHC crack initiation will be easy. On the contrary, where the hydride habit plane is tilting from the cracking plane, the crack initiation will be difficult, leading to an increase in threshold stress intensity factor, K IH , or to an increase in DHC resistance. Cheadle et al. [28] pointed out that hydride reorientation will become easier if their basal plane normals are parallel to the tensile stress. In this situation, the reoriented hydride platelets will be parallel to the basal plane of \u03b1-zirconium. Since the effective hydride platelets during the DHC process are those reoriented ones, the relative orientation between the basal plane of \u03b1-zirconium and the cracking plane will be an important factor in DHC initiation and propagation. Therefore, Coleman et al. [29] proposed that if the crystallographic texture can be arranged so that the basal plane normals of \u03b1-grains are nearly perpendicular to the major tensile stress, DHC can be diminished. Thus, DHC behavior is closely related to the texture of Zr-alloys. Since { 1 0 1 \u00af 7 } planes are the most favorable habit planes for the precipitation of hydrides in zirconium alloys under tensile stress [3,28,34\u201336] , the initiation of DHC may depend strongly on the available number of the habit planes that is determined by texture. So we speculated that the higher K IH values along the rolling direction of a N18 alloy plate may be owing to the texture of the N18 alloy plate. We will discuss in detail in Section 3.2 . 3.2 Effect of texture The K IH is a critical K I value over which the crack grows physically through the DHC mechanism. The DHC mechanism involves the kinetics of the formation of the hydride, namely, the diffusion of hydrogen to the crack tip region and the precipitation of the hydride and its fracture under the given loading condition. When the applied load is constant, then the applied K I at the crack tip will be constant. Only the precipitation of the hydride at the crack tip will be changed with time. The load enduring capability will be decreased with an increased fraction of the hydride at the crack tip. If the applied load or stress at the crack tip exceeds the load enduring capability with the aid of the hydride at the crack tip, a certain length of the mixture of the hydride and matrix will be fractured simultaneously, and this process will be repeated. This is the very mechanism of a DHC. Therefore, there might be inherent K IH values of a given texture, according to the distribution of the basal planes or the habit plane of the hydride, { 1 0 1 7 }. So some studies focused on the effect of texture variation on the DHC behaviors [29,30,34\u201337] and had confirmed that the K IH decreases linearly with a basal pole component ( F ) oriented along crack plane normal in various Zr-alloy plates and tubes, as shown in Fig. 9 . This shows that there is a significant texture dependence regardless of the materials. This is due to the fact that the major phase is \u03b1-Zr in zirconium alloys. The decreasing K IH trend with F was explained by the rule of a mixture [3,36] . The volume fraction of the ductile matrix can be assumed as (1 \u2212 F ) and that of the brittle hydride can be assumed as F , because the physical meaning of F is the resolved fraction of the basal plane in the cracking plane. The texture dependence of K IH can be expressed by the following Eq. (3) [3,36] . (3) K IH = ( 1 - F ) \u00d7 K IH \u2217 + F \u00d7 K IC , where K IH \u2217 is the fracture toughness of a complete ductile matrix containing hydrogen at F = 0, and K IC is the fracture toughness of hydride which is reported as K IC = 1\u20133 MPa m [3,36] . The increase in F in the cracking plane reduces the area of the ductile matrix. This means that the plane having a higher F has a lower resistance to a DHC. Therefore, if F for the cracking plane is higher, then the K IH is lower; the K IH decreases with F , and vise versa. The K IH of N18 alloy plate along the rolling direction is plotted against the basal pole component in Fig. 9 . This shows that the trend is consistent with the literature. The relationship between tensile stress direction, the cracking direction and the cracking plane in the CT specimens is shown in Fig. 2 . In the present study, (0 0 0 2) poles in the N18 alloy plate are concentrated in the plate normal, as discussed above. It is known that DHC in Zr-alloys occurs due to the repetition of precipitation of brittle hydrides and their fracture when the hydrogen content is over TSS (terminal solid solubility) at the temperature of the system, and that hydrides precipitate on the habit planes { 1 0 1 7 } under tensile stress, and the crack grows by hydrides precipitated on the habit planes, which are tilted by 15\u00b0 from the basal plane (0 0 0 2) [3,34,35,37,38] . However, in the case of the CT specimens, the cracking plane is along RD\u2013ND plate. The interplanar angle between the cracking plane of the CT specimen and the habit plane of the hydride is \u223c75\u00b0. Therefore, there is lower number of grains having habit plane for the hydride near or parallel to the cracking plane. This is why the CT specimens along the rolling direction are difficult to crack by a DHC. It is natural, that K IH for DHC initiation in the rolling direction is higher than the previous data. This means that the N18 plate in rolling direction has a higher resistance to a DHC. 3.3 SEM fractography The low magnification fractograph are compared in Fig. 10 . They illustrate the typical DHC fracture patterns obtained in the LIM tests carried out at 205 \u00b0C. The characteristics of the DHC surfaces obtained in the LDM tests carried out at 245 \u00b0C and 255 \u00b0C respectively show larger depth variations and a portion of ductile fracture in Figs. 11 and 12 . It is clear that the DHC surfaces are very bumpy and show some chunky-wedges. This suggests that DHC cracking may encounter the lesser basal planes in the cracking plane and propagates through the various grain orientations. Then cracking is difficult, therefore, the required energy to propagate the DHC crack will be increased, and thus, it is the reason that the fracture surfaces are less smooth. 4 Conclusions The threshold stress intensity factor ( K IH ) values for an initiation of delayed hydride cracking (DHC) in a N18 (Zr\u2013Sn\u2013Nb\u2013Fe\u2013Cr) alloy plate which was manufactured in China were investigated for the first time. By using both the load-increasing mode (LIM) and load drop method (LDM), the load increasing method gives nonconservative results in comparison with the load drop method over a temperature range of 150\u2013255 \u00b0C. In the LIM, K IH \u2019s of the N18 alloy plate appeared to be in the range of 31 \u2013 32.5 MPa m , and K IH in the LDM appeared to be in the range of 27.5 \u2013 28.6 MPa m . This means that the plate normal textured of N18 alloy plate has high tolerance for DHC initiation along the rolling direction. The fact that the N18 alloy plate has a higher K IH can be explained in terms of the lower basal plane density in the cracking plane. The characteristics of the DHC surfaces are very bumpy and show larger depth variations and a portion of ductile fracture. It is attributed to the less basal planes in the cracking plane.

        "title": "Study of the critical temperatures for delayed hydride cracking in N18 zirconium alloy",
        "abstract": "Zirconium alloys are used extensively in nuclear reactor cores. During their service a part of hydrogen produced through the corrosion reaction of Zr with hot coolant is absorbed by materials. Hydride induced embrittlement significantly influences the in-service performance of the Zr-alloy components. Delayed hydride cracking (DHC) is a localized form of hydride embrittlement, consequently, hydrogen atoms in the solid solution will diffuse into this region ahead of the crack tip subjected to a triaxial state of stress, which may lower the chemical potential of the region. Once the hydrogen concentration in this region reaches the terminal solid solubility (TSS), hydrides will start to form and grow. When the hydrides at the crack tip reach a critical size, the main crack will propagate through this hydrided region. The crack front finally is arrested at the end of the hydrided region by the ductile zirconium matrix, and the whole process repeats itself. Most of the investigations on DHC in zirconium alloys are focused on Zr-Nb alloys. Few literatures were found on the subject of DHC in Zr-Sn alloys. The purpose of the present study was to investigate critical temperature for initiating and arresting delayed hydride cracking in Zr-Sn-Nb alloy. A critical temperature for DHC study was carried out to determine the critical temperature for initiating and arresting in N18 zirconium alloy (Zr-Sn-Nb alloy). For a given hydrogen concentration of a specimen, the two critical temperatures were observed-a DHC initiation temperature, T c, at which DHC would initiate when approaching the test temperature from above the terminal solid solubility (C d) temperature in hydride dissolution and a DHC arrest temperature, Th, obtained by heating the same specimen from T c after DHC had started. T c slightly below T h. Both T c and T h fall below the dissolution solvus temperature and above the precipitation solvus temperature. A theoretical analysis was carried out to quantitatively determine the hydrogen concentration limit and these critical temperatures using the method of Dutton and Plus, a key assumption in the method is that, while the local crack tip stress concentration causes a local enhancement of the hydrogen concentration in solution, the hydride precipitation solvus is unaffected by stress. Good agreements are obtained between measured and predicted values of critical temperatures, which support the Dutton-Plus theory.",

        "abstract": "Delayed hydride cracking(DHC)has been recognized as a potential threat to the structural intcgrity of zirconium alloy components in water-cooled nuclear reactors since the early 1970 s.Although DHC has been studied for a long time,most of the investigations were focused on unirradiated Zr-Nb and Zr-Sn alloys,no information was found on Zr-Sn-Nb alloy. Currently,several new Zr-based alloys have been developed from the point of view of enhancement of corrosion resistance and hydrogen pickup properties.In China,N18(Zr-Sn-Nb)alloy has been developed based on Zr-Sn and Zr-Nb systems to meet the requirements of higher fuel burn-up.Therefore,it is necessary to investigate the DHC behavior of N18 alloy systematically. The objective of this study is to predict the critical temperatures for initiating and arresting DHC in irradiated N18 alloy.A model used to forecast DHC critical temperature of irradiated zirconium alloys was established based on the terminal solid solubility of hydrogen in irradiated zirconium alloys and stress-induced hydrogen diffusion.By using the model,the critical temperatures for irradiated N18 alloy were predicted.The result showed that the irradiated N18 alloy has high sensitivity for DHC initiation,because neutron irradiation increased the solubility of hydrogen and yield strength of N18 alloy.Compared with unirradiated N18 alloy,the critical temperature of irradiated N18 alloy rise nearly 20\u2103.The variation of critical temperatures of irradiated N18 alloy is similar to the unirradiated one.T_c is slightly less than T_h.",

It is found that in the process of stress relaxation, the plastic deformation rate of the alloy decreases with the relaxation time, and this rate and the stress reduction ratio at the end of relaxation exhibit a minimum value at about 623 K. The activation volume associated with dislocation motion is found from the relationship between the stress and relaxation time. A noticeable maximum value appears around 623 K when the activation volume plotted against the temperature, which suggests that at this temperature, DSA is most pronounced.

        "title": "Prediction of critical temperature for delayed hydride cracking in irradiated N18 zirconium alloy",
        "abstract": "Delayed hydride cracking (DHC) has been recognized as a potential threat to the structural integrity of zirconium alloy components in water-cooled nuclear reactors since the early 1970 s. Although DHC has been studied for a long time, most of the investigations were focused on unirradiated Zr-Nb and Zr-Sn alloys, no information was found on Zr-Sn-Nb alloy. Currently, several new Zr-based alloys have been developed from the point of view of enhancement of corrosion resistance and hydrogen pickup properties. In China, N18 (Zr-Sn-Nb) alloy has been developed based on Zr-Sn and Zr-Nb systems to meet the requirements of higher fuel burn-up. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the DHC behavior of N18 alloy systematically. The objective of this study is to predict the critical temperatures for initiating and arresting DHC in irradiated N18 alloy. A model used to forecast DHC critical temperature of irradiated zirconium alloys was established based on the terminal solid solubility of hydrogen in irradiated zirconium alloys and stress-induced hydrogen diffusion. By using the model, the critical temperatures for irradiated N18 alloy were predicted. The result showed that the irradiated N18 alloy has high sensitivity for DHC initiation, because neutron irradiation increased the solubility of hydrogen and yield strength of N18 alloy. Compared with unirradiated N18 alloy, the critical temperature of irradiated N18 alloy rise nearly 20\u00b0C. The variation of critical temperatures of irradiated N18 alloy is similar to the unirradiated one. Tc is slightly less than Th. \u00a9.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by deposition of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) as senile plaques and by the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed primarily of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) via its potent activator p25 has recently been shown to promote phosphorylation of tau at AD-specific phosphoepitopes, and increased cleavage of p35 to p25 has been demonstrated in AD patients, suggesting that Cdk5 may represent a pathogenic tau protein kinase. We were interested in the potential effect of soluble forms of Abeta on Cdk5-mediated AD-like tau phosphorylation, insofar as previous studies of human biopsies and aged canine and primate brains have shown that dystrophic neurites appear before the formation of neuritic plaques. We transfected N2a cells with a p35 vector (N2a/p35 cells) and, after differentiation, challenged these cells with Abeta(1-42) peptide in soluble form (sAbeta(1-42)). Results show that sAbeta(1-42) at relatively low levels (1-5 microM) dose-dependently increases tau phosphorylation at AD-specific phosphoepitopes in differentiated N2a/p35 cells compared with controls, an effect that is blocked by antisense oligonucleotides against p35. sAbeta(1-42)-induced tau phosphorylation is concomitant with an increase in both p25 to p35 ratio and Cdk5 activity (but not protein levels). Additionally, blockade of L-type calcium channels or inhibition of calpain completely abolishes this effect. Taken together, these data indicate that sAbeta is a potent activator of the p25/Cdk5 pathway, resulting in promotion of AD-like tau phosphorylation in vitro.",

We have recently shown promising preclinical results with the use of green tea polyphenol, (\u2212)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in mouse models of both diseases, however the translation into clinical use has been problematic primarily as a result of poor bioavailability and inefficient delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). While the antioxidant properties of EGCG are well known, we have shown that it is able to promote non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by upregulating \u03b1-secretase, thus preventing brain beta amyloid plaque formation, a hallmark of AD pathology and common finding in HIV infection. In this preliminary study, we investigated the ability of one preformulation method to improve the oral bioavailability of EGCG. We found that forming nanolipidic EGCG particles improves the neuronal (SweAPP N2a cells) \u03b1-secretase enhancing ability in vitro by up to 91% ( P < 001) and it's oral bioavailability in vivo by more than two-fold over free EGCG.

        "abstract": "Prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment is rising. Amyloid-beta (A-beta) plaque deposition in the brain may be a contributing factor as epidemiological data suggests significant numbers of long-term HIV survivors are at elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). HIV-1 Tat-induced A-beta deposition, tau phosphorylation, and subsequent neuronal death could be risk factors for subsequent AD and/or HIV-related cognitive impairment. To mimic this clinical condition, we generated mice with HIV-1 Tat-induced AD-like pathology. We first performed a short-term Doxycycline (dox) dosing (54, 108, and 216 mg/kg/day) study in transgenic mice whose astrocytes express HIV-1 Tat via activation of a GFAP/dox-inducible promoter. After one week, mouse brains were examined histologically and the expression of Bcl-xL, Bax, and phospho-tau was investigated by Western blotting. We next cross-bred these mice with the PSAPP mouse model of AD. To simulate chronic Tat secretion over periods longer than one week, we used an optimized dose of 54 mg/kg/day on a bi- weekly basis over three months; based on the initial dose ranging study in the Tat transgenic mice. This was followed by antisera detection of A-beta, and Western blot for phospho-tau, Bcl-xL, and Bax. Tat significantly induced neuron degeneration and tau phosphorylation in Tat transgenic mice, dox dependently (P<0.001) with the most robust effects at the 216 mg/kg/day dose. In the long term study, similar effects at the chronic 54 mg/kg/day dose were observed in PSAPP/Tat mice induced with dox. These mice also showed significantly more A-beta deposition (P < 0.05), neurodegeneration, neuronal apoptotic signaling, and phospho-tau than PSAPP mice (P < 0.05). In conclusion, HIV-1 Tat significantly promotes AD-like pathology in PSAPP/Tat mice. This model may provide a framework in which to identify new mechanisms involved in cognitive impairment in the HIV infected population, and possible treatments. Additional works will be needed to fully characterize the mechanism(s) of HIV- induced amyloid deposition, and also to uncover viral mechanisms promoting AD-like pathology in general.",

        "abstract": "Our previous studies showed that the green tea-derived polyphenolic compound (-)-epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) reduces amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) production in both neuronal and mouse Alzheimer's disease (AD) models in concert with activation of estrogen receptor-\u03b1/phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (ER\u03b1/PI3K/Akt) signaling and anti-amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) \u03b1-secretase (a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain-10, ADAM10) processing. Since the gallate moiety in EGCG may correspond to the 7\u03b1 position of estrogen, thereby facilitating ER binding, we extensively screened the effect of other gallate containing phenolic compounds on APP anti-amyloidogenic processing. Octyl gallate (OG; 10 \u00b5M), drastically decreased A\u03b2 generation, in concert with increased APP \u03b1-proteolysis, in murine neuron-like cells transfected with human wild-type APP or \"Swedish\" mutant APP. OG markedly increased production of the neuroprotective amino-terminal APP cleavage product, soluble APP-\u03b1 (sAPP\u03b1). In accord with our previous study, these cleavage events were associated with increased ADAM10 maturation and reduced by blockade of ER\u03b1/PI3k/Akt signaling. To validate these findings in vivo, we treated A\u03b2-overproducing Tg2576 mice with OG daily for one week by intracerebroventricular injection and found decreased A\u03b2 levels associated with increased sAPP\u03b1. These data indicate that OG increases anti-amyloidogenic APP \u03b1-secretase processing by activation of ER\u03b1/PI3k/Akt signaling and ADAM10, suggesting that this compound may be an effective treatment for AD.",

It is well documented that brain inflammatory mechanisms mediated by reactive glia are activated in response to Abeta plaques. A number of reports further suggest that T-cells are activated in AD patients, and that these cells exist both in the periphery and as infiltrates in the brain. We explore the potential role of T-cells in the AD process, a controversial area, by reviewing reports that show disturbed activation profiles and/or altered numbers of various subsets of T-cells in the circulation as well as in the AD brain parenchyma and in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We also discuss the recent Abeta immunotherapy approach vis-\u00e0-vis the activated, autoaggressive T-cell infiltrates that contributed to aseptic meningoencephalitis in a small percentage of patients, and present possible alternative approaches that may be both efficacious and safe. Finally, we explore the use of mouse models of AD as a system within which to definitively test the possible contribution of T-cells to AD pathogenesis.",

HIV promotion of an M1 antigen presenting cell (APC) - like microglial phenotype, through the promotion of CD40 activity, may impair endogenous mechanisms important for amyloid- beta (A\u03b2) protein clearance. Further, a chronic pro-inflammatory cycle is established in this manner. CD45 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor which negatively regulates CD40L-CD40-induced microglial M1 activation; an effect leading to the promotion of an M2 phenotype better suited to phagocytose and clear A\u03b2. Moreover, this CD45 mediated activation state appears to dampen harmful cytokine production. As such, this property of microglial CD45 as a regulatory \"off switch\" for a CD40-promoted M1, APC-type microglia activation phenotype may represent a critical therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of neurodegeneration, as well as microglial dysfunction, found in patients with HAD.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as a progressive loss of synapses and neurons in the brain. The major pertinacious component of amyloid plaques is A\u03b2, a variably sized peptide derived from the integral membrane protein amyloid precursor protein (APP). The A\u03b2 region of APP locates partly within its ecto- and trans-membrane domains. APP is cleaved by three proteases, designated as \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-secretases. Processing by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase cleaves the N- and C-terminal ends of the A\u03b2 region, respectively, releasing A\u03b2, whereas \u03b1-secretase cleaves within the A\u03b2 sequence, releasing soluble APP\u03b1 (sAPP\u03b1). The \u03b3-secretase cleaves at several adjacent sites to yield A\u03b2 species containing 39\u201343 amino acid residues. Both \u03b1- and \u03b2-cleavage sites of human wild-type APP are located in APP672\u2013699 region (ectodomain of \u03b2-C-terminal fragment, ED-\u03b2-CTF or ED-C99). Therefore, the amino acid residues within or near this region are definitely pivotal for human wild-type APP function and processing. Here, we report that one ED-C99-specific monoclonal antibody (mAbED-C99) blocks human wild-type APP endocytosis and shifts its processing from \u03b1- to \u03b2-cleavage, as evidenced by elevated accumulation of cell surface full-length APP and \u03b2-CTF together with reduced sAPP\u03b1 and \u03b1-CTF levels. Moreover, mAbED-C99 enhances the interactions of APP with cholesterol. Consistently, intracerebroventricular injection of mAbED-C99 to human wild-type APP transgenic mice markedly increases membrane-associated \u03b2-CTF. All these findings suggest that APP672\u2013699 region is critical for human wild-type APP processing and may provide new clues for the pathogenesis of sporadic AD.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, therapeutics targeted to improve mitochondrial function could be beneficial. Plant-derived flavonoids have shown promise in improving certain AD phenotypes, but the overall mechanism of action(s) through which flavonoids protect from AD is still unknown. To identify flavonoids and other natural products that may correct amyloid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, 25 natural products were screened for their ability to restore altered mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, or ATP levels in neuroblastoma cells expressing mutant amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP). Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and luteolin were identified as the top two mitochondrial restorative compounds from the in vitro screen. EGCG was further tested in vivo to determine its effects on brain mitochondrial function in an A\u03b2PP/PS-1 (presenilin 1) double mutant transgenic mouse model of AD. EGCG treatment restored mitochondrial respiratory rates, MMP, ROS production, and ATP levels by 50 to 85% in mitochondria isolated from the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum. The results of this study lend further credence to the notion that EGCG and other flavonoids, such as luteolin, are 'multipotent therapeutic agents' that not only reduce toxic levels of brain A\u03b2, but also hold the potential to protect neuronal mitochondrial function in AD.",

        "abstract": "Maternal immune activation (MIA) can affect fetal brain development and thus behavior of young and adult offspring. Reports have shown that increased Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the maternal serum plays a key role in altering fetal brain development, and may impair social behaviors in the offspring. Interestingly, these effects could be attenuated by blocking IL-6. The current study investigated the effects of luteolin, a citrus bioflavonoid, and its structural analog, diosmin, on IL-6 induced JAK2/STAT3 (Janus tyrosine kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) phosphorylation and signaling as well as behavioral phenotypes of MIA offspring. Luteolin and diosmin inhibited neuronal JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo following IL-6 challenge as well as significantly diminishing behavioral deficits in social interaction. Importantly, our results showed that diosmin (10mg/kgday) was able to block the STAT3 signal pathway; significantly opposing MIA-induced abnormal behavior and neuropathological abnormalities in MIA/adult offspring. Diosmin's molecular inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 pathway may underlie the attenuation of abnormal social interaction in IL-6/MIA adult offspring.",

We previously explored the beneficial effect of (\u2212)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on AD mice and found increased non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the \u03b1-secretase a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10). Our results in this study suggest that EGCG-mediated enhancement of non-amyloidogenic processing of APP is mediated by the maturation of ADAM10 via an estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER\u03b1)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Ak-transforming dependent mechanism, independent of furin-mediated ADAM10 activation. These data support prior assertions that central selective ER modulation could be a therapeutic target for AD and support the use of EGCG as a well-tolerated alternative to estrogen therapy in the prophylaxis and treatment of this disease.",

        "abstract": "We previously reported that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (20\u00a0mg/kg) of (\u2212)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the main polyphenolic constituent of green tea, decreased \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) levels and plaques via promotion of the non-amyloidogenic \u03b1-secretase proteolytic pathway in \u201cSwedish\u201d mutant amyloid precursor protein overexpressing (APPsw, Tg) mice. Here, we find that EGCG administered orally in drinking water (50\u00a0mg/kg) similarly reduces A\u03b2 deposition in these mice. Following a six month treatment of an 8\u00a0month old cohort, immunohistochemical analysis of coronal sections reveals that plaque burdens were reduced in the cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex by 54%, 43%, and 51%, respectively. Congo red plaque burdens were decreased in the cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex by 53%, 53%, and 58%, respectively as well. ELISA of brain homogenates of the treatment Tg mice revealed consistent reductions in both A\u03b2 1\u201340 and 1\u201342 soluble and insoluble forms. In the present study we also investigated the effect EGCG administration had on tau pathology and cognition in Tg mice. Both i.p. and orally-treated Tg animals were found to have modulated tau profiles, with markedly suppressed sarkosyl-soluble phosphorylated tau isoforms. Radial arm water maze (RAWM) testing for working memory indicated that EGCG provided cognitive benefit to Tg mice with both i.p. and oral administration, although i.p.-treated animals showed a more pronounced benefit because of the greater impairment of their Tg controls at the time of testing. Taken together, these data further the notion of EGCG dietary supplementation as a potentially safe and effective prophylaxis for Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common dementia and is pathologically characterized by deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) into beta-amyloid plaques, neuronal injury and low-level, chronic activation of brain immunity. Transforming growth factor-betas (TGF-betas) are pleiotropic cytokines that have key roles in immune cell activation, inflammation and repair after injury. We genetically interrupted TGF-beta and downstream Smad2/3 signaling (TGF-beta-Smad2/3) in innate immune cells by inducing expression of CD11c promoter-driven dominant-negative TGF-beta receptor type II in C57BL/6 mice (CD11c-DNR), crossed these mice with mice overexpressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein, the Tg2576 Alzheimer's disease mouse model, and evaluated Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. Aged double-transgenic mice showed complete mitigation of Tg2576-associated hyperactivity and partial mitigation of defective spatial working memory. Brain parenchymal and cerebrovascular beta-amyloid deposits and Abeta abundance were markedly (up to 90%) attenuated in Tg2576-CD11c-DNR mice. This was associated with increased infiltration of Abeta-containing peripheral macrophages around cerebral vessels and beta-amyloid plaques. In vitro, cultures of peripheral macrophages, but not microglia, from CD11c-DNR mice showed blockade of classical TGF-beta-activated Smad2/3 but also showed hyperactivation of alternative bone morphogenic protein-activated Smad1/5/8 signaling and increased Abeta phagocytosis. Similar effects were noted after pharmacological inhibition of activin-like kinase-5, a type I TGF-beta receptor. Taken together, our results suggest that blockade of TGF-beta-Smad2/3 signaling in peripheral macrophages represents a new therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular plaques of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are implicated in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis. Abeta formation is precluded by alpha-secretase, which cleaves within the Abeta domain of APP generating soluble APP-alpha (sAPP-alpha). Thus, alpha-secretase upregulation may be a target AD therapy. We previously showed green tea derived EGCG increased sAPP-alpha in AD mouse models. However, the comparable effective dose of EGCG in humans may exceed clinical convenience and/or safety. Epidemiological studies suggested fish oil consumption is associated with reduced dementia risk. Here we investigated whether oral co-treatment with fish oil (8mg/kg/day) and EGCG (62.5mg/kg/day or 12.5mg/kg/day) would reduce AD-like pathology in Tg2576 mice. In vitro co-treatment of N2a cells with fish oil and EGCG enhanced sAPP-alpha production compared to either compound alone (P<0.001). Fish oil enhanced bioavailability of EGCG versus EGCG treatment alone (P<0.001). Fish oil and EGCG had a synergetic effect on inhibition of cerebral Abeta deposits (P<0.001) suggesting moderate supplementation with EGCG and fish oil having significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of AD.",

        "abstract": "We have shown that, when an amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) overproducing transgenic mouse model (PSAPP) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is treated with a depleting antibody against CD40L, it causes marked attenuation of Abeta pathology associated with decreased amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and increased cerebral clearance of Abeta. Here, we report that, when PSAPP mice receive a regimen of anti-CD40L antibody commencing at an age associated with initial Abeta deposition, they demonstrate superior spatial memory on the standard water maze and radial arm water maze tasks, as well as exhibiting superior non-spatial memory in the object recognition test, as compared to control PSAPP mice. Furthermore, PSAPP mice treated with an anti-CD40L antibody regimen commencing at an age associated with extensive Abeta deposition demonstrate superior spatial memory on the standard water maze task, as compared to control PSAPP mice. Disruption of CD40L activity has beneficial effects on pathology and cognitive behavior in the PSAPP mouse model, providing support for the therapeutic potential of interrupting the CD40-CD40L interaction in AD.",

        "abstract": "Aging is associated with a decline in function in many of the stem cell niches of the body. An emerging body of literature suggests that one of the reasons for this decline in function is due to cell non-autonomous influences on the niche from the body. For example, studies using the technique of parabiosis have demonstrated a negative influence of blood from aged mice on muscle satellite cells and neurogenesis in young mice. We examined if we could reverse this effect of aged serum on stem cell proliferation by treating aged rats with NT-020, a dietary supplement containing blueberry, green tea, vitamin D3, and carnosine that has been shown to increase neurogenesis in aged rats. Young and aged rats were administered either control NIH-31 diet or one supplemented with NT-020 for 28 days, and serum was collected upon euthanasia. The serum was used in cultures of both rat hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Serum from aged rats significantly reduced cell proliferation as measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assays in both NPCs and MSCs. Serum from aged rats treated with NT-020 was not different from serum from young rats. Therefore, NT-020 rescued the effect of serum from aged rats to reduce stem cell proliferation.",

        "title": "The opioid receptor system and alcoholism: a genetic perspective.",
        "abstract": "Over the past decade, mounting evidence has implicated the endogenous opioid receptor system as a central player in the etiology of alcohol drinking behavior in animals and alcoholism in humans. Much of this work is a product of a pharmacological approach, where differences in opioid receptor pharmacology have been found to predict drinking behavior in animal models of alcoholism, including rats and mice selectively bred for alcohol preference and avoidance. This review considers the opioid receptor system and alcoholism from a genetic standpoint, and discusses investigation into opioid receptor pharmacology in animal models of alcoholism as work that paved the way for the more recent molecular genetic studies implicating the delta-, and particularly, the mu opioid receptors as genetically linked to alcoholism-associated phenotypes in animal models of the disease. These genetic studies are set within the broader context of the candidate gene approach for alcoholism, where opioid receptor genes are taken to be partial, rather than complete, risk factors for alcoholism. Building upon these findings, the recent genetic association between alcoholism and the mu opioid receptor gene in humans is discussed. Finally, the translation of such genetic association studies between opioid receptor genes and alcoholism to a pharmacogenetic approach, allowing for the evaluation of putative relationships between genotype and pharmacological response profiles, is suggested to address the etiological question of what the molecular mechanism is underlying opioid receptor genetic risk for alcoholism phenotypes.",

In this study, we report that CD40 expression on microglia is greatly enhanced by a low dose (10 U/ml) of IFN-gamma. We also find that ligation of microglial CD40 by CD40L triggers a significant production of TNF-alpha. Activation of microglia by ligation of CD40 in the presence of IFN-gamma results in cultured cortical neuronal injury, which is markedly attenuated by blockade of the CD40 pathway or neutralization of TNF-alpha. Finally, we find significant levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the medium of co-cultured activated CD4+ T cells and microglial cells, showing that microglia can supply the CD40 receptor to activated CD4+ T cells and suggesting that this cellular interaction is a key event in MS pathophysiology.",

        "abstract": "Although social, physical, and cognitive activities have each been suggested to reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), epidemiologic studies cannot determine which activity or combination of activities is most important. To address this question, mutant APP transgenic AD mice were reared long-term in one of four housing conditions (impoverished, social, social + physical, or complete enrichment) from 1\u00bd through 9 months of age. Thus, a stepwise layering of social, physical, and enhanced cognitive activity was created. Behavioral evaluation in a full battery of sensorimotor, anxiety, and cognitive tasks was carried out during the final 5 weeks of housing. Only AD mice raised in complete enrichment (i.e., enhanced cognitive activity) showed: (1) protection against cognitive impairment, (2) decreased brain \u03b2-amyloid deposition, and (3) increased hippocampal synaptic immunoreactivity. The protection provided by enhanced cognitive activity spanned multiple cognitive domains (working memory, reference learning, and recognition/identification). Cognitive and neurohistologic benefits of complete enrichment occurred without any changes in blood cytokine or corticosterone levels, suggesting that enrichment-dependent mechanisms do not involve changes in the inflammatory response or stress levels, respectively. These results indicate that the enhanced cognitive activity of complete enrichment is required for cognitive and neurologic benefit to AD mice\u2014physical and/or social activity are insufficient. Thus, our data suggest that humans who emphasize a high lifelong level of cognitive activity (over and above social and physical activities) will attain the maximal environmental protection against AD.

Here we report that transgenic mice overproducing Abeta, but deficient in CD40L, showed decreased astrocytosis and microgliosis associated with diminished Abeta levels and beta-amyloid plaque load. Furthermore, in the PSAPP transgenic mouse model of AD, a depleting antibody against CD40L caused marked attenuation of Abeta/beta-amyloid pathology, which was associated with decreased amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and increased circulating levels of Abeta. Conversely, in neuroblastoma cells overexpressing wild-type human APP, the CD40-CD40L interaction resulted in amyloidogenic APP processing. These findings suggest several possible mechanisms underlying mitigation of AD pathology in response to CD40L depletion, and validate the CD40-CD40L interaction as a target for therapeutic intervention in AD.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, and the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is known to induce mitochondrial dysfunction. The relative degree of mitochondrial dysfunction in different regions of the brain in AD is not completely understood. Moreover, the relationship between levels of synaptic mitochondrial Abeta and mitochondrial dysfunction has not been clearly established. Therefore synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria were isolated from the hippocampus, cortex, striatum, and amygdala of 12 month AbetaPPsw and AbetaPP+PS1 mouse models of AD as well as nontransgenic mice. Mitochondrial respiratory rates, reactive oxygen species production, membrane potential, and cytochrome c oxidase activity were measured. Hippocampal and cortical mitochondria showed the highest levels of mitochondrial dysfunction, while striatal mitochondria were moderately affected, and amygdalar mitochondria were minimally affected. Mitochondria from AbetaPP/PS1 brain regions were more impaired than those from AbetaPP mice. Mitochondrial Abeta levels nearly mirrored the extent of mitochondrial dysfunction. Synaptic mitochondria were more impaired than nonsynaptic mitochondria in the AD mouse models. The AbetaPP/PS1 mice showed more impairment in the cognitive interference task of working memory than the AbetaPP mice. The association between mitochondrial Abeta levels and mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse models of AD supports a primary role for mitochondrial Abeta in AD pathology. Moreover, the degree of cognitive impairment in AD transgenic mice can be linked to the extent of synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial Abeta levels, suggesting that a mitochondrial Abeta-induced signaling cascade may contribute to cognitive impairment. Therapeutics that target this cascade could be beneficial in the treatment of AD.",

        "abstract": "Activated microglial cells have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and HIV dementia. It is well known that inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), cytokines, and chemokines play an important role in microglial cell-associated neuron cell damage. Our previous studies have shown that CD40 signaling is involved in pathological activation of microglial cells. Many data reveal that cannabinoids mediate suppression of inflammation in vitro and in vivo through stimulation of cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2).In this study, we investigated the effects of a cannabinoid agonist on CD40 expression and function by cultured microglial cells activated by IFN-gamma using RT-PCR, Western immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and anti-CB2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) analyses. Furthermore, we examined if the stimulation of CB2 could modulate the capacity of microglial cells to phagocytise Abeta1-42 peptide using a phagocytosis assay.We found that the selective stimulation of cannabinoid receptor CB2 by JWH-015 suppressed IFN-gamma-induced CD40 expression. In addition, this CB2 agonist markedly inhibited IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation of JAK/STAT1. Further, this stimulation was also able to suppress microglial TNF-alpha and nitric oxide production induced either by IFN-gamma or Abeta peptide challenge in the presence of CD40 ligation. Finally, we showed that CB2 activation by JWH-015 markedly attenuated CD40-mediated inhibition of microglial phagocytosis of Abeta1-42 peptide. Taken together, these results provide mechanistic insight into beneficial effects provided by cannabinoid receptor CB2 modulation in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD.",

        "abstract": "Reactive microglia have been suggested to play a role in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) process, and previous studies have shown that expression of CD45, a membrane-bound protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), is elevated in microglia in AD brain compared with controls. To investigate the possible role of CD45 in microglial responsiveness to beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, we first co-treated primary cultured microglia with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor [potassium bisperoxo (1,10-phenanthroline) oxovanadate (phen), 5 micrometer] and freshly solubilized Abeta peptides (1000 nm). Data show synergistic induction of microglial activation as evidenced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production and nitric oxide (NO) release, both of which we show to be dependent on activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Furthermore, co-treatment with phen and Abeta peptides results in microglia-induced neuronal cell injury. Stimulation of microglial CD45 by anti-CD45 antibody markedly inhibits these effects via inhibition of p44/42 MAPK, suggesting that CD45 is a negative regulator of microglial activation. Accordingly, primary cultured microglia from CD45-deficient mice demonstrate hyper-responsiveness to Abeta, as evidenced by TNF-alpha release, NO production, and neuronal injury after stimulation with Abeta peptides. As a validation of these findings in vivo, brains from a transgenic mouse model of AD [transgenic Swedish APP-overexpressing (Tg APP(sw)) mice] deficient for CD45 demonstrate markedly increased production of TNF-alpha compared with Tg APP(sw) mice. Taken together, these results suggest that therapeutic agents that stimulate the CD45 PTP signaling pathway may be effective in suppressing microglial activation associated with AD.",

Here, we probed the putative causal relationship between enhanced astrocytic activation and exacerbation of brain damage in 4/4-KI mice using arundic acid (ONO-2506, Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd), which is known to oppose astrocytic activation through its inhibitory action on S100B synthesis. In all of the KI mice, administration of arundic acid (10 mg/kg day, intraperitoneal, started immediately after pMCAO) induced significant amelioration of brain damage at 5 days after pMCAO in terms of infarct volumes (results expressed as the mean infarct volume (mm(3)) +/-1s.d. in 2/2-, 3/3-, or 4/4-KI mice in the vehicle groups: 16 +/- 2, 15 +/- 2, or 22 +/- 2; in the arundic acid groups: 11 +/- 2 (P < 0.001), 11 +/- 2 (P < 0.001), or 12 +/- 2 (P < 0.001), as compared with the vehicle groups), neurologic deficits, and S100/glial fibrillary acidic protein burden in the peri-infarct area. The beneficial effects of arundic acid were most pronounced in 4/4-KI mice, wherein delayed infarct expansion together with deterioration of neurologic deficits was almost completely mitigated. The above results support the notion that the apoE4 isoform exacerbates brain damage during the subacute phase of pMCAO through augmentation of astrocytic activation. Thus, pharmacological modulation of astrocytic activation may confer a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic brain damage, particularly in APOE epsilon4 carriers.",

        "abstract": "\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides are the major protein components of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Vascular damage and reactive gliosis are found colocalized with amyloid deposits in AD brains, suggesting that the vasculature may be a clinically significant site of AD pathology. Our results show that freshly solubilized A\u03b2 1\u201340 enhances the vasoconstriction induced by endothelin-1 (ET-1) and increases resistance to relaxation triggered by nitric oxide (NO), suggesting that A\u03b2 may oppose the NO/cGMP pathway. Using specific inhibitors and activators of the NO/cGMP pathway, we show that A\u03b2 vasoactivity is not due to a modulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) or soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). However, we find that a selective cGMP phosphodiesterase (cGMP-PDE) inhibitor (dipyridamole) is able to interactively block the enhanced vasoconstriction as well as the opposition to relaxation induced by A\u03b2, suggesting that A\u03b2 could effect the activity of this enzyme. Cyclic GMP levels, but not cAMP concentrations, are reduced after A\u03b2 treatment of rat aortic rings, further substantiating this hypothesis. Moreover, in examination of this pathway in another cell type pertinent to AD, we find that A\u03b2 induces a proinflammatory response in microglia as evidenced by increased leukotriene B4 release. We show that both dipyridamole and compounds which increase cGMP levels prevent A\u03b2-induced microglial inflammation. Our results suggest that therapeutic intervention aimed at reduction of microglial-mediated inflammation via inhibition of cGMP-PDE or elevation of cGMP may be beneficial in the treatment of AD.",

        "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that immunization of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid-\u03b2 1\u201342 peptide (A\u03b2 1\u201342 ) results in prevention of A\u03b2 plaque formation and amelioration of established plaques in the brain. As the response of the T lymphocyte helper (Th) arm of the immune response had not yet been investigated after A\u03b2 immunization, we i.p. immunized C57BL/6 mice with A\u03b2 1\u201342 , A\u03b2 1\u201340 , or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and examined markers of Th1 and Th2 immune responses in spleen and in splenocytes from these mice. Spleens from A\u03b2 1\u201342 -immunized mice demonstrated decreased interleukin-12 receptor beta chain expression compared to mice immunized with A\u03b2 1\u201340 or PBS. Consistently, following stimulation with concanavalin A or anti-CD3 antibody, primary splenocytes from A\u03b2 1\u201342 -immunized mice demonstrated elevated secretion of interleukin-4 and interleukin-10, and decreased levels of interferon-\u03b3. To validate this Th1\u2192Th2 shift in a transgenic mouse model of AD, we immunized Tg APP sw mice (line 2576) with A\u03b2 1\u201342 and found decreased Th1 (interleukin-2 and interferon-\u03b3) and elevated Th2 (interleukin-4 and interleukin-10) cytokines in their stimulated primary splenocytes. Interferon-\u03b3 was markedly reduced and interleukin-10 was increased in blood plasma from these mice, effects that were associated with dramatically mitigated A\u03b2 deposition after A\u03b2 1\u201342 immunization. Taken together, these results show enhanced Th2 and down-regulated Th1 immunity following immune challenge with A\u03b2 1\u201342 .",

        "abstract": "Microglia are CNS resident innate immune cells of myeloid origin that become activated and produce innate proinflammatory molecules upon encountering bacteria or viruses. TLRs are a phylogenetically conserved diverse family of sensors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns that drive innate immune responses. We have recently shown that mice deficient in TLR3 (TLR3(-/-) mice) are resistant to lethal encephalitis and have reduced microglial activation after infection with West Nile virus, a retrovirus that produces dsRNA. We wished to determine whether microglia recognize dsRNA through the TLR3 pathway. In vitro, murine wild-type primary cultured microglia responded to synthetic dsRNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) by increasing TLR3 and IFN-beta mRNA and by morphologic activation. Furthermore, wild-type microglia dose dependently secreted TNF-alpha and IL-6 after poly(I:C) challenge, whereas TLR3(-/-) microglia produced diminished cytokines. Activation of MAPK occurred in a time-dependent fashion following poly(I:C) treatment of wild-type microglia, but happened with delayed kinetics in TLR3(-/-) microglia. As an in vivo model of encephalitis, wild-type or TLR3(-/-) mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with poly(I:C) or LPS, and microglial activation was assessed by cell surface marker or phospho-MAPK immunofluorescence. After intracerebroventricular injection of poly(I:C), microgliosis was clearly evident in wild-type mice but was nearly absent in TLR3(-/-) animals. When taken together, our results demonstrate that microglia recognize dsRNA through TLR3 and associated signaling molecules and suggest that these cells are key sensors of dsRNA-producing viruses that may invade the CNS.",

        "abstract": "Microglia are innate immune cells of myeloid origin that take up residence in the central nervous system (CNS) during embryogenesis. While classically regarded as macrophage-like cells, it is becoming increasingly clear that reactive microglia play more diverse roles in the CNS. Microglial \"activation\" is often used to refer to a single phenotype; however, in this review we consider that a continuum of microglial activation exists, with phagocytic response (innate activation) at one end and antigen presenting cell function (adaptive activation) at the other. Where activated microglia fall in this spectrum seems to be highly dependent on the type of stimulation provided. We begin by addressing the classical roles of peripheral innate immune cells including macrophages and dendritic cells, which seem to define the edges of this continuum. We then discuss various types of microglial stimulation, including Toll-like receptor engagement by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, microglial challenge with myelin epitopes or Alzheimer's beta-amyloid in the presence or absence of CD40L co-stimulation, and Alzheimer disease \"immunotherapy\". Based on the wide spectrum of stimulus-specific microglial responses, we interpret these cells as immune cells that demonstrate remarkable plasticity following activation. This interpretation has relevance for neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases where reactive microglia play an etiological role; in particular viral/bacterial encephalitis, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer disease.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive age-related dementia in the elderly and the fourth major cause of disability and mortality in that population. The disease is pathologically characterized by deposition of \u03b2-amyloid plaques neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Current strategies for the treatment of AD are symptomatic only. As such, they are less than efficacious in terms of significantly slowing or halting the underlying pathophysiological progression of the disease. Modulation by cell therapy may be new promising disease-modifying therapy. Recently, we showed reduction in amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) levels/\u03b2-amyloid plaques and associated astrocytosis following low-dose infusions of mononuclear human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs). Our current study extended our previous findings by examining cognition via (1) the rotarod test, (2) a 2-day version of the radial-arm water maze test, and (3) a subsequent observation in an open pool platform test to characterize the effects of monthly peripheral HUCBC infusion (1\u00d710(6) cells/\u03bcL) into the transgenic PSAPP mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis (bearing mutant human APP and presenilin-1 transgenes) from 6 to 12 months of age. We show that HUCBC therapy correlates with decreased (1) cognitive impairment, (2) A\u03b2 levels/\u03b2-amyloid plaques, (3) amyloidogenic APP processing, and (4) reactive microgliosis after a treatment of 6 or 10 months. As such, this report lays the groundwork for an HUCBC therapy as potentially novel alternative to oppose AD at the disease-modifying level.",

        "abstract": "Brain aging is characterized by numerous physiological, structural, functional, and neurocognitive changes. The interplay of these various processes is complex and characterized by large interindividual differences. Although much is not understood about how we age, there are numerous studies detailing the nature of the changes in the brain as we age. This chapter will review some of the functional, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and immunological processes known to occur in normal or \u201chealthy\u201d aging. Large epidemiological studies of older adults have shown health status in the elderly is a function of the negative consequences and impairment in functional performance caused by medical co\u2010morbidities. Immunological function declines with age, such that adaptive immunity is reduced to previously encountered pathogens, and there is a weakened adaptive immune response to novel pathogens. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies of cognitively intact older adults have consistently shown volume loss and loss of white matter structural integrity, particularly in prefrontal cortex, which may be associated with cognitive decline. While data are incomplete, one consistent finding has been a decline in cognitive domains, such as arithmetic/numerical ability and perceptual speed. Alternatively, other cognitive functions such as verbal ability, word knowledge, and semantic memory remain quite preserved even to old age. Factors identified for healthy cognitive (brain) aging are multifactorial, and likely incorporate biological systems as well as cognitive reserve.",

        "abstract": "Using homozygous human apolipoprotein E2 (apoE2) (2/2)-, apoE3 (3/3)-, or apoE4 (4/4)-knock-in (KI) mice, we aimed to examine whether an apoE isoform-specific exacerbation of delayed infarct expansion occurs after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Compared with 2/2- or 3/3-KI mice, 4/4-KI mice exhibited significantly larger infarct volumes and worse neurologic deficits after pMCAO, with no significant differences between the latter two groups. Infarct volume in 4/4-KI mice was significantly increased from 1 to 5 days after pMCAO, whereas that in 2/2- or 3/3-KI mice was not significantly altered. DNA fragmentation in the peri-infarct area as detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphatenick end-labeling was increased to a similar degree in all of the KI mice by 5 days after pMCAO, with no significant differences among the mouse groups. At every time-point examined, human apoE was most markedly expressed in the peri-infarct area, with similar immunoreactivity among the three lines of KI mice. The glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactive burden in the peri-infarct area was progressively increased through 7 days in 4/4-KI mice, but not in 2/2- or 3/3-KI mice. Taken together, these data show that the apoE4 isoform acts to aggravate delayed infarct expansion and peri-infarct reactive astrocytosis during the subacute phase of pMCAO in genetically engineered apoE-KI mice.",

        "abstract": "T-cell-dependent immunity in the central nervous system (CNS) is beneficial for neuroprotection, neurogenesis and even behavior. As a highly specialized site, the CNS is speculated to possess the means to maintain T-cell immune responses through its own resident cells. Therefore, we investigated whether microglia, the most potent antigen-presenting cells residing in the CNS, could sustain T-cell responses in vitro. We showed that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-activated microglia (MG(IFN-gamma)) inducibly expressed an important immune co-stimulatory molecule, OX40 ligand (OX40L). Co-culture of activated CD4(+) T cells with MG(IFN-gamma) significantly increased T-cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, and these effects were markedly inhibited by addition of a neutralizing anti-OX40L monoclonal antibody. In addition, ligation of OX40L in MG(IFN-gamma) enhanced their production of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). These results suggest that the expression of OX40L in microglia provides a molecular basis for the maintenance of T-cell survival, expansion of T cells and increased secretion of remedial growth factor from MG(IFN-gamma), which may contribute to the protective effect in the CNS.",

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection of the central nervous system occurs in the vast majority of HIV-infected patients. HIV-associated dementia (HAD) represents the most severe form of HIV-related neuropsychiatric impairment and is associated with neuropathology involving HIV proteins and activation of proinflammatory cytokine circuits. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) activates the JAK/STAT1 pathway, a key regulator of inflammatory and apoptotic signaling, and is elevated in HIV-1-infected brains progressing to HAD. Recent reports suggest green tea-derived (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can attenuate neuronal damage mediated by this pathway in conditions such as brain ischemia. In order to investigate the therapeutic potential of EGCG to mitigate the neuronal damage characteristic of HAD, IFN-gamma was evaluated for its ability to enhance well-known neurotoxic properties of HIV-1 proteins gp120 and Tat in primary neurons and mice. Indeed, IFN-gamma enhanced the neurotoxicity of gp120 and Tat via increased JAK/STAT signaling. Additionally, primary neurons pretreated with a JAK1 inhibitor, or those derived from STAT1-deficient mice, were largely resistant to the IFN-gamma-enhanced neurotoxicity of gp120 and Tat. Moreover, EGCG treatment of primary neurons from normal mice reduced IFN-gamma-enhanced neurotoxicity of gp120 and Tat by inhibiting JAK/STAT1 pathway activation. EGCG was also found to mitigate the neurotoxic properties of HIV-1 proteins in the presence of IFN-gamma in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest EGCG attenuates the neurotoxicity of IFN-gamma augmented neuronal damage from HIV-1 proteins gp120 and Tat both in vitro and in vivo. Thus EGCG may represent a novel natural copound for the prevention and treatment of HAD.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that most neurodegenerative diseases are associated with microglia-mediated inflammation. Our previous research demonstrates that the CD40 signaling is critically involved in microglia-related immune responses in the brain. For example, it is well known that the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway plays a central role in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced microglial CD40 expression. We and others have previously reported that microglial CD40 expression is significantly induced by IFN-gamma and amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide. Recent studies have shown that certain flavonoids possess anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties distinct from their well-known anti-oxidant effects. In particular, flavonoids, apigenin and luteolin have been found to be effective CD40 immunomodulators.Cultured microglia, both N9 and primary derived lines, were treated with flavonoids in the presence of IFN-gamma and/or CD40 ligation to assess any anti-inflammatory effects and/or mechanisms. CD40 expression on microglia was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms were confirmed by ELISA for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-alpha, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and STAT1 Western blotting.Apigenin and luteolin concentration-dependently suppressed IFN-gamma-induced CD40 expression. Apigenin and luteolin also suppressed microglial TNF-alpha and IL-6 production stimulated by IFN-gamma challenge in the presence of CD40 ligation. In addition, apigenin and luteolin markedly inhibited IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 with little impact on cell survival.Our findings provide further support for apigenin and luteolin's anti-inflammatory effects and suggest that these flavonoids may have neuroprotective/disease-modifying properties in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

        "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides (predominantly A\u03b240, 42) and their aggregation into plaques in the brain are thought to be the one of the major causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Originally discovered in our Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing human wild-type amyloid precursor protein (APP) (CHO/APPwt) cultures devoid of A\u03b2 production, we found that Mycoplasma selectively degrades soluble A\u03b2 in a time and dose (colony forming unit) dependent manner. Moreover, we fully characterized the Mycoplasma species as Mycoplasma hyorhinis (M. hyorhinis) by genetic and colony morphological analyses by light microscopy. Most interestingly, we attenuated the pathogenicity of M. hyorhinis by \u03b3 irradiation (3.5 Gy), and found that its ability to degrade A\u03b2 was retained. On the other hand, heated and sonicated M. hyorhinis failed to retain this ability to degrade A\u03b2, suggesting that this degradation requires viable cells and likely a biologically active signaling pathway. In addition, we found that M. hyorhinis can degrade A\u03b2 produced in AD model mice (PSAPP mice) ex vivo. Finally, we found that irradiated (non-pathogenic) M. hyorhinis also can degrade A\u03b2 produced in PSAPP mice in vivo. These studies suggest that irradiated (non-pathogenic) M. hyorhinis can be a novel and alternative biological strategy for AD treatment.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that neuronal apoptosis induced by the Alzheimer's disease (AD) \u03b2 -amyloid peptide (A \u03b2 ) is related to alteration of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. It has been demonstrated that Bcl-X L (Bcl-X L =protein, bcl-X L =gene), a Bcl-2-related protein, prevents apoptosis in mammalian cells. Additionally, TGF- \u03b2 1 is able to protect cultured neuronal cells from A \u03b2 -induced apoptosis via upregulation of bcl-X L and bcl-2 gene expression. We show that A \u03b2 treatment (500 nM, freshly solubilized) results in apoptosis and necrosis in differentiated PC12 cells maintained with a low dose of NGF- \u03b2 (1 ng/ml). To investigate whether transfection of PC12 cells with bcl-X L could block A \u03b2 -induced apoptosis, we transfected these cells with a bcl-X L construct (pcDNA-bcl-X L ). Data show that bcl-X L significantly inhibits both early-stage apoptosis and late-stage apoptosis/necrosis produced by A \u03b2 treatment (1000 nM) in pcDNA3-bcl-X L -transfected PC12 cells as compared with pcDNA3 vector-transfected PC12 cells. These results suggest that Bcl-X L exhibits both anti-necrotic as well as anti-apoptotic roles in A \u03b2 -challenged PC12 cells.",

AD patients have dysregulated immunity, and PS1 mutant mice exhibit abnormal systemic immune responses. To test whether immune function abnormality caused by a mutant human PS1 gene (mhPS1) could modify AD-like pathology, we reconstituted immune systems of AD model mice carrying a mutant human amyloid precursor protein gene (mhAPP; Tg2576 mice) or both mhAPP and mhPS1 genes (PSAPP mice) with allogeneic bone marrow cells. Here, we report a marked reduction in amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) levels, \u03b2-amyloid plaques and brain inflammatory responses in PSAPP mice following strain-matched wild-type PS1 bone marrow reconstitution. These effects occurred with immune switching from pro-inflammatory T helper (Th) 1 to anti-inflammatory Th2 immune responses in the periphery and in the brain, which likely instructed microglia to phagocytose and clear A\u03b2 in an ex vivo assay. Conversely, Tg2576 mice displayed accelerated AD-like pathology when reconstituted with mhPS1 bone marrow. These data show that haematopoietic cells bearing the mhPS1 transgene exacerbate AD-like pathology, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for AD based on targeting PS1 in peripheral immune cells.",

There is currently no single molecular marker or laboratory tool capable of diagnosing autism at an early age. The purpose of this study is to explore the plausible use of peripheral biomarkers in the early diagnosis of autism via a sensitive ELISA. Here, we measured plasma secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPP-\u03b1) levels in autistic and aged-matched control blood samples and found a significantly increased level of sAPP-\u03b1 in 60% of the known autistic children. We then tested 150 human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) samples and found significantly elevated levels of plasma sAPP-\u03b1 in 10 of 150 samples. As an additional confirmatory measure, we performed Western blot analysis on these samples which consistently showed increased sAPP-\u03b1 levels in autistic children and 10 of 150 HUCB samples; suggesting a group of autistic patients which could be identified in early childhood by levels of sAPP-\u03b1. While there is need for further studies of this concept, the measurement of sAPP-\u03b1 levels in serum and human umbilical cord blood by ELISA is a potential tool for early diagnosis of autism.",

        "abstract": "Microglial activation, characterized by p38 MAPK or p44/42 MAPK pathway signal transduction, occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous studies demonstrated CD45, a membrane-bound protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), opposed beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide-induced microglial activation via inhibition of p44/42 MAPK. Additionally we have shown agonism of the RB isoform of CD45 (CD45RB) abrogates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial activation.In this study, CD45RB modulation of Abeta peptide or LPS-activated primary cultured microglial cells was further investigated. Microglial cells were co-treated with \"aged\" FITC-Abeta(1-42) and multiple CD45 isoform agonist antibodies. Data revealed cross-linking of CD45, particularly the CD45RB isoform, enhances microglial phagocytosis of Abeta(1-42) peptide and inhibits LPS-induced activation of p44/42 and p38 pathways. Co-treatment of microglial cells with agonist CD45 antibodies results in significant inhibition of LPS-induced microglial TNF-alpha and IL-6 release through p44/42 and/or p38 pathways. Moreover, inhibition of either of these pathways augmented CD45RB cross-linking induced microglial phagocytosis of Abeta(1-42) peptide. To investigate the mechanism(s) involved, microglial cells were co-treated with a PTP inhibitor (potassium bisperoxo [1,10-phenanthroline oxovanadate; Phen]) and Abeta(1-42) peptides. Data showed synergistic induction of microglial activation as evidenced by TNF-alpha and IL-6 release; both of which are demonstrated to be dependent on increased p44/42 and/or p38 activation. Finally, it was observed that cross-linking of CD45RB in the presence of Abeta(1-42) peptide, inhibits co-localization of microglial MHC class II and Abeta peptide; suggesting CD45 activation inhibits the antigen presenting phenotype of microglial cells.In summary, p38 MAPK is another novel signaling pathway, besides p44/42, in which CD45RB cross-linking negatively regulates microglial Abeta phagocytosis while increasing potentially neurotoxic inflammation. Therefore, agonism of CD45RB PTP activity may be an effective therapeutic target for novel agents to treat AD due to its Abeta lowering, and inflammation reducing, properties that are particularly targeted at microglial cells. Such treatments may be more effective with less potential to produce systemic side-effects than therapeutics which induce non-specific, systemic down-regulation of inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced inflammatory reactions may partially drive the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data also implicate similar inflammatory processes in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). To evaluate the roles of Abeta in the inflammatory processes in vascular tissues, we have tested the ability of Abeta to trigger inflammatory responses in cultured human vascular cells. We found that stimulation with Abeta dose-dependently increased the expression of CD40, and secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in endothelial cells. Abeta also induced expression of IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) both in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Characterization of the Abeta-induced inflammatory responses in the vascular cells showed that the ligation of CD40 further increased cytokine production and/or the expression of IFN-gammaR. Moreover, IL-1beta and IFN-gamma synergistically increased the Abeta-induced expression of CD40 and IFN-gammaR. We have recently found that Abeta induces expression of adhesion molecules, and that cytokine production and interaction of CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L) further increase the Abeta-induced expression of adhesion molecules in these same cells. These results suggest that Abeta can function as an inflammatory stimulator to activate vascular cells and induces an auto-amplified inflammatory molecular cascade, through interactions among adhesion molecules, CD40-CD40L and cytokines. Additionally, Abeta1-42, the more pathologic form of Abeta, induces much stronger effects in endothelial cells than in smooth muscle cells, while the reverse is true for Abeta1-40. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that the Abeta-induced inflammatory responses in vascular cells may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of CAA and AD.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. We have recently shown,that Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) transgenic mice given a moderate,level of caffeine intake (the human,equivalent of 5 cups of coffee per day) are protected from development,of otherwise certain cognitive impairment and have decreased hippocampal,amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) levels due to suppression of both \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and presenilin 1 (PS1)/\u03b3-secretase expression. To determine if caffeine intake can have beneficial effects in \u201caged\u201d APPsw mice already demonstrating,cognitive impairment, we administered caffeine in the drinking water of 18\u201319 month old APPsw mice that were impaired in working memory. At 4\u20135 weeks into caffeine treatment, those impaired transgenic mice given caffeine (Tg/Caff) exhibited vastly superior working memory compared to the continuing impairment of control transgenic mice. In addition, Tg/Caff mice had substantially reduced A\u03b2 deposition in hippocampus (\u219340%) and entorhinal cortex (\u219346%), as well as correlated decreases in brain soluble A\u03b2 levels. Mechanistically, evidence is provided that caffeine suppression of BACE1 involves the cRaf-1/NF\u03baB pathway. We also determined that caffeine concentrations within human,physiological range effectively reduce active and total glycogen,synthase kinase 3 levels in SweAPP N2a cells. Even with pre-existing and substantial A\u03b2 burden, aged APPsw mice exhibited memory restoration and reversal of AD pathology, suggesting a treatment potential of caffeine in cases of established AD.

Previous studies by Tone and colleagues suggested that five isoforms of CD40 exist with two predominant isoforms expressed in humans: signal-transducible CD40 type I and a C-terminal truncated, non-signal-transducible CD40 type II. We hypothesized that differential expression of CD40 isoform type I and type II in neurons may modulate neuron differentiation. Results show that adult wild-type, and CD40(-/-) deficient mice predominantly express CD40 type I and II isoforms. Whereas adult wild-type mice express mostly CD40 type I in cerebral tissues at relatively high levels, in age and gender-matched CD40(-/-) mice CD40 type I expression was almost completely absent; suggesting a predominance of the non-signal-transducible CD40 type II isoform. Younger, 1 day old wild-type mice displayed less CD40 type I, and more CD40 type II, as well as, greater expression of soluble CD40 (CD40L/CD40 signal inhibitor), compared with 1 month old mice. Neuron-like N2a cells express CD40 type I and type II isoforms while in an undifferentiated state, however once induced to differentiate, CD40 type I predominates. Further, differentiated N2a cells treated with CD40 ligand express high levels of neuron specific nuclear protein (NeuN); an effect reduced by anti-CD40 type I siRNA, but not by control (non-targeting) siRNA. Altogether these data suggest that CD40 isoforms may act in a temporal fashion to modulate neuron differentiation during brain development. Thus, modulation of neuronal CD40 isoforms and CD40 signaling may represent important therapeutic modalities for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as, for enhancement of neurogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Several prior investigations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have indicated naturally occurring autoantibodies against amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) species are produced. Although many studies have focused on the relative concentrations or binding affinities of autoantibodies against A\u03b2-related proteins in AD and aging, data regarding their functional properties are limited. It is generally believed that these antibodies act to aid in clearance of A\u03b2. However, as antibodies which bind to A\u03b2 also typically bind to the parent amyloid precursor protein (APP), we reasoned that certain A\u03b2-targeting autoantibodies may bind to APP thereby altering its conformation and processing. Here we show for the first time, that naturally occurring A\u03b2-reactive autoantibodies isolated from AD patients, but not from healthy controls, promote \u03b2-secretase activity in cultured cells. Furthermore, using monoclonal antibodies to various regions of A\u03b2, we found that antibodies generated against the N-terminal region, especially A\u03b2(1-17) , dose dependently promoted amyloidogenic processing of APP via\u03b2-secretase activation. Thus, this property of certain autoantibodies in driving A\u03b2 generation could be of etiological importance in the development of sporadic forms of AD. Furthermore, future passive or active anti-A\u03b2 immunotherapies must consider potential off-target effects resulting from antibodies targeting the N-terminus of A\u03b2, as co-binding to the corresponding region of APP may actually enhance A\u03b2 generation.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the term \"inflammaging\" was coined by Franceshci and colleagues to characterize a widely accepted paradigm that ageing is accompanied by a low-grade chronic up-regulation of certain pro-inflammatory responses. Inflammaging differs significantly from the traditional five cardinal features of acute inflammation in that it is characterized by a relative decline in adaptive immunity and T-helper 2 responses and is associated with increased innate immunity by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. While the over-active innate immunity characteristic of inflammaging may remain subclinical in many elderly individuals, a portion of individuals (postulated to have a \"high responder inflammatory genotype\") may shift from a state of \"normal\" or \"subclinical\" inflammaging to one or more of a number of age-associated diseases. We and others have found that IFN-gamma and other pro-inflammatory cytokines interact with processing and production of Abeta peptide, the pathological hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that inflammaging may be a \"prodrome\" to AD. Although conditions of enhanced innate immune response with overproduction of pro-inflammatory proteins are associated with both healthy aging and AD, it is suggested that those who age \"well\" demonstrate anti-inflammaging mechanisms and biomarkers that likely counteract the adverse immune response of inflammaging. Thus, opposing the features of inflammaging may prevent or treat the symptoms of AD. In this review, we fully characterize the aging immune system. In addition, we explain how three novel treatments, (1) human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC), (2) flavanoids, and (3) Abeta vaccination oppose the forces of inflammaging and AD-like pathology in various mouse models.",

        "abstract": "Aging represents the greatest risk for development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and changes in peripheral immune cell phenotypes have been found to be associated with aging. Using flow cytometry, we measured the relative expression levels of CD45 isoforms, a marker of nai;ve versus memory CD4+ T cell status, on isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes from patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, normal elderly, cognitively abnormal elderly, and patients with clinically diagnosed other forms of dementia. Data show significantly lower levels of CD45RA, and an increase in the CD45RO/CD45RA ratio, on CD4+ T cells in patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (n=46) and in cognitively abnormal individuals (n=37) compared to age-matched normal participants (n=90). Patients diagnosed with other forms of dementia (n=19) did not significantly differ from normal individuals. Both CD45RA and the CD45RO/CD45RA ratio had higher positive and negative predictive values and were more sensitive biomarkers of probable AD than the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele, and had greater predictive ability for probable AD by regression analyses. Additionally, a testing strategy employing apolipoprotein E genotyping and CD45RA or the CD45RO/CD45RA ratio revealed increased sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and predictive ability over the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele. These data show altered peripheral immunity in AD patients, and raise the possibility that a testing strategy using CD45 isoform alteration on CD4+ T cells and apolipoprotein E genotype may be clinically valuable for diagnosing probable AD.",

        "title": "Characterization of murine immunoglobulin G antibodies against human amyloid-\u03b21\u201342",
        "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that immunization of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid-\u03b2 1\u201342 peptide (A\u03b2 1\u201342 ) results in amelioration of AD-like pathology, including reduced soluble and deposited \u03b2-amyloid and decreased cognitive impairment. Based on the proposed importance of immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-A\u03b2 antibodies (Abs) in these effects, we sought to characterize these Abs in splenocytes from mice immunized with A\u03b2 1\u201342 . Data show that a more aggregated preparation of A\u03b2 1\u201342 gives a robust IgG anti-A\u03b2 Ab response, while these Abs are almost undetectable when a less aggregated preparation of A\u03b2 1\u201342 is used as the immunogen. Importantly, IgG anti-A\u03b2 Ab production is detected after just 12 weeks of A\u03b2 1\u201342 treatment. Analysis of anti-A\u03b2 Ab IgG isotypes reveals that the majority of these Abs are IgG1, with significantly fewer Abs of the IgG2a or IgG2b isotypes (IgG1>IgG2a>IgG2b), suggesting a T lymphocyte helper type II response after A\u03b2 1\u201342 immunization. To determine the epitope of A\u03b2 recognized by IgG anti-A\u03b2 Abs, intact A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 peptide fragments were analyzed for their ability to bind these Abs. Data show that these Abs specifically recognize an amino-terminal epitope of A\u03b2 between amino acids one and twelve, with higher affinity for a more soluble preparation of A\u03b2 1\u201342 . These data further indicate the immunogenic potential of A\u03b2 1\u201342 and offer insight into the nature of the IgG anti-A\u03b2 Ab response.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a substantial inflammatory component, and activated microglia may play a central role in neuronal degeneration. CD40 expression was increased on cultured microglia treated with freshly solublized amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2, 500 nanomolar) and on microglia from a transgenic murine model of AD (Tg APPsw). Increased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 production and induction of neuronal injury occurred when A\u03b2-stimulated microglia were treated with CD40 ligand (CD40L). Microglia from Tg APPsw mice deficient for CD40L demonstrated reduction in activation, suggesting that the CD40-CD40L interaction is necessary for A\u03b2-induced microglial activation. Finally, abnormal tau phosphorylation was reduced in Tg APPsw animals deficient for CD40L, suggesting that the CD40-CD40L interaction is an early event in AD pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) immunotherapy accomplished by vaccination with \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide has proved efficacious in AD mouse models. However, \u201cactive\u201d A\u03b2 vaccination strategies for the treatment of cerebral amyloidosis without concurrent induction of detrimental side effects are lacking. We have developed a transcutaneous (t.c.) A\u03b2 vaccination approach and evaluated efficacy and monitored for deleterious side effects, including meningoencephalitis and microhemorrhage, in WT mice and a transgenic mouse model of AD. We demonstrate that t.c. immunization of WT mice with aggregated A\u03b21\u201342 plus the adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) results in high-titer A\u03b2 antibodies (mainly of the Ig G1 class) and A\u03b21\u201342-specific splenocyte immune responses. Confocal microscopy of the t.c. immunization site revealed Langerhans cells in areas of the skin containing the A\u03b21\u201342 immunogen, suggesting that these unique innate immune cells participate in A\u03b21\u201342 antigen processing. To evaluate the efficacy of t.c. immunization in reducing cerebral amyloidosis, transgenic PSAPP (APPsw, PSEN1dE9) mice were immunized with aggregated A\u03b21\u201342 peptide plus CT. Similar to WT mice, PSAPP mice showed high A\u03b2 antibody titers. Most importantly, t.c. immunization with A\u03b21\u201342 plus CT resulted in significant decreases in cerebral A\u03b21\u201340,42 levels coincident with increased circulating levels of A\u03b21\u201340,42, suggesting brain-to-blood efflux of A\u03b2. Reduction in cerebral amyloidosis was not associated with deleterious side effects, including brain T cell infiltration or cerebral microhemorrhage. Together, these data suggest that t.c. immunization constitutes an effective and potentially safe treatment strategy for AD.",

        "abstract": "Modulation of immune/inflammatory responses by diverse strategies including amyloid-\ufffd (A\ufffd ) im- munization, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and manipulation of microglial activation states has been shown to reduce Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology and cognitive deficits in AD trans- genic mouse models. Human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs) have unique immunomodulatory potential. We wished to test whether these cells might alter AD-like pathology after infusion into the PSAPP mouse model of AD. Here, we report a marked reduction in Alevels/\ufffd -amyloid plaques and associated astrocytosis following multiple low-dose infusions of HUCBCs. HUCBC infusions also reduced cerebral vascular Adeposits in the Tg2576 AD mouse model. Interestingly, these ef- fects were associated with suppression of the CD40-CD40L interaction, as evidenced by decreased circulating and brain soluble CD40L (sCD40L), elevated systemic immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels, attenuated CD40L-induced inflammatory responses, and reduced surface expression of CD40 on microglia. Importantly, deficiency in CD40 abolishes the effect of HUCBCs on elevated plasma A\ufffd levels. Moreover, microglia isolated from HUCBC-infused PSAPP mice demonstrated increased phagocytosis of A\ufffd . Furthermore, sera from HUCBC-infused PSAPP mice significantly increased microglial phagocytosis of the A\ufffd 1-42 peptide while inhibiting interferon-\ufffd -induced microglial CD40 expression. Increased microglial phagocytic activity in this scenario was inhibited by addition of re- combinant CD40L protein. These data suggest that HUCBC infusion mitigates AD-like pathology by disrupting CD40L activity.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive dementia and is pathologically characterized by brain deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide as senile plaques. Inflammatory and immune response pathways are chronically activated in AD patient brains at low levels, and likely play a role in disease progression. Like microglia, activated astrocytes produce numerous acute-phase reactants and proinflammatory molecules in the AD brain. One such molecule, S100B, is highly expressed by reactive astrocytes in close vicinity of beta-amyloid deposits. We have previously shown that augmented and prolonged activation of astrocytes has a detrimental impact on neuronal survival. Furthermore, we have implicated astrocyte-derived S100B as a candidate molecule responsible for this deleterious effect. To evaluate a putative relationship between S100B and AD pathogenesis, we crossed transgenic mice overexpressing human S100B (TghuS100B mice) with the Tg2576 mouse model of AD, and examined AD-like pathology. Brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular beta-amyloid deposits and Abeta levels were increased in bigenic Tg2576-huS100B mice. These effects were associated with increased cleavage of the beta-C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), elevation of the N-terminal APP cleavage product (soluble APPbeta), and activation of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1. In addition, double transgenic mice showed augmented reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis, high levels of S100 expression, and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines as early as 7-9 months of age. These results provide evidence that (over)-expression of S100B acts to accelerate AD-like pathology, and suggest that inhibiting astrocytic activation by blocking S100B biosynthesis may be a promising therapeutic strategy to delay AD progression..",

Furthermore, we have suggested that the astrocyte-derived protein S100B may be important in these pathogenic events. However, the causal relationship between S100B and exacerbation of brain damage in vivo remains to be elucidated.Using transgenic mice overexpressing human S100B (Tg huS100B mice), we examined whether S100B plays a cardinal role in aggravation of brain damage after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO).Tg huS100B mice had significantly larger infarct volumes and worse neurological deficits at any time point examined after pMCAO as compared with CD-1 background strain-matched control mice. Infarct volumes in Tg huS100B mice were significantly increased from 1 to 3 and 5 days after pMCAO (delayed infarct expansion), whereas those in control mice were not significantly altered. S100, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and Iba1 burdens in the periinfarct area were significantly increased through to 7 days after pMCAO in Tg huS100B mice, whereas those in control mice reached a plateau at 3 days after pMCAO.These results provide genetic evidence that overexpression of human S100B acts to exacerbate brain damage and periinfarct reactive gliosis (astrocytosis and microgliosis) during the subacute phase of pMCAO.",

It has previously been shown that this dyad acts synergistically with the Alzheimer amyloid-beta peptide to promote microglial activation. Reactive microglia produce potentially neurotoxic substances such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and the reactive oxygen species nitric oxide, which can induce bystander neuronal injury at high levels. When a transgenic mouse model of AD is crossed with an animal deficient in CD40L, the resulting phenotype is deficient in the gliosis observed in a mouse model of AD in which CD40L is present. Additionally, these crossed animals have complete absence of AD-like neuronal Tau hyperphosphorylation, a marker of the preneuronal tangle pathology in AD patients. This suggests that the CD40-CD40L system is a critical enhancer of microglial activation in an AD transgenic mouse model and that such activation is associated with an increase in a key indicator of neuronal stress. Conversely, the finding that reduced CD40-CD40L interaction is associated with reduced chronic microgliosis and Tau hyperphosphorylation supports the view that, in general, mechanisms that reduce microgliosis will be beneficial in AD.",

        "abstract": "Up to 50% of long-term HIV infected patients, including those with systemically well-controlled infection, commonly experience memory problems and slowness, difficulties in concentration, planning, and multitasking. Deposition of A\u03b2 plaques is also a common pathological feature of HIV infection. However, it is not clear whether this accumulation is due to AD-like processes, HIV-associated immunosuppression, Tat protein-induced A\u03b2 elevations, and/or the effects of single highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here we evaluated the effects of several ART medications (Zidovudine, Lamivudine, Indinavir, and Abacavir) alone and in combination on: 1) A\u03b21-40, 42 generation in murine N2a cells transfected with the human \"Swedish\" mutant form of APP; 2) microglial phagocytosis of FITC-A\u03b21-42 peptides in cultured murine N9 microglia. We report for the first time that these antiretroviral compounds (10 \u03bcM) generally increase A\u03b2 generation (~50-200%) in SweAPP N2a cells and markedly inhibit microglial phagocytosis of FITC-A\u03b21-42 peptides in murine microglia. The most significant amyloidogenic effects were observed with combined ART (p < 0.05); suggesting certain ART medications may have additive amyloidogenic effects when combined. As these antiretroviral compounds are capable of penetrating the blood brain barrier and reaching the concentrations employed in the in vitro studies, these findings raise the possibility that ART may play a casual role in the elevated A\u03b2 found in the brains of those infected with HIV. Therefore these compounds may consequently contribute to cognitive decline observed in HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).",

        "abstract": "Efavirenz (EFV) is among the most commonly used antiretroviral drugs globally, causes neurological symptoms that interfere with adherence and reduce tolerability, and may have central nervous system (CNS) effects that contribute in part to HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Thus we evaluated a commonly used EFV containing regimen: EFV/zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) in murine N2a cells transfected with the human \"Swedish\" mutant form of amyloid precursor protein (SweAPP N2a cells) to assess for promotion of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) production. Treatment with EFV or the EFV containing regimen generated significantly increased soluble amyloid beta (A\u03b2), and promoted increased \u03b2-secretase-1 (BACE-1) expression while 3TC, AZT, or, vehicle control did not significantly alter these endpoints. Further, EFV or the EFV containing regimen promoted significantly more mitochondrial stress in SweAPP N2a cells as compared to 3TC, AZT, or vehicle control. We next tested the EFV containing regimen in A\u03b2 - producing Tg2576 mice combined or singly using clinically relevant doses. EFV or the EFV containing regimen promoted significantly more BACE-1 expression and soluble A\u03b2 generation while 3TC, AZT, or vehicle control did not. Finally, microglial A\u03b2 phagocytosis was significantly reduced by EFV or the EFV containing regimen but not by AZT, 3TC, or vehicle control alone. These data suggest the majority of A\u03b2 promoting effects of this cART regimen are dependent upon EFV as it promotes both increased production, and decreased clearance of A\u03b2 peptide.",

        "abstract": "Rapamycin is a well known immunosuppressant drug for rejection prevention in organ transplantation. Numerous clinical trials using rapamycin analogs, involving both children and adults with various disorders are currently ongoing worldwide. Most recently, rapamycin gained much attention for what appears to be life-span extending properties when administered to mice. The risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) is strongly and positively correlated with advancing age and is characterized by deposition of \u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\u03b2) as senile plaques in the brain. We report that rapamycin (2.5 \u03bcM), significantly increases A\u03b2 generation in murine neuron-like cells (N2a) transfected with the human \u201cSwedish\u201d mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP). In concert with these observations, we found rapamycin significantly decreases the neuroprotective amino-terminal APP (amyloid precursor protein) cleavage product, soluble APP-\u03b1 (sAPP-\u03b1) while increasing production of the \u03b2-carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP (\u03b2-CTF). These cleavage events are associated with decreased activation of a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain-10 (ADAM-10), an important candidate \u03b1-secretase which opposes A\u03b2 generation. To validate these findings in vivo , we intraperitoneal (i.p.) injected Tg2576 A\u03b2-overproducing transgenic mice with rapamycin (3 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. We found increased A\u03b2 levels associated with decreased sAPP-\u03b1 at an average rapamycin plasma concentration of 169.7 \u00b1 23.5 ng/mL by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These data suggest that although rapamycin may increase the lifespan in some mouse models, it may not decrease the risk for age-associated neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Keywords Beta-amyloid Rapamycin Alzheimer\u2019s Abeta ADAM10 Sirolimus Rapamune Aging Neurodegeneration 1 Introduction According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, abnormal accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brain is a direct cause of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [1\u20134] . The hypothesis is supported by the identification of familial mutations of APP (amyloid precursor protein) and presenilins (PS-1, 2) [5\u20138] . These mutations lead to increased generation of the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2); and especially the 42-amino acid form (A\u03b2 1\u201342 ) displays an increased propensity for aggregation and formation of amyloid plaques and subsequent dementia in humans [9] . More recently, it has been suggested that accumulation of smaller toxic oligomers of A\u03b2 may be more relevant than plaques to mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline [10,11] . Rapamycin, (i.e. sirolimus, rapamune), is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent organ rejection, especially in kidney transplantation (review in [12] ). It is a naturally occurring non-antibiotic macrolide compound first discovered over 30 years ago as a product of the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus in a soil sample from Easter Island [13] . Recently, however it has been tested as an anti-aging compound. In a 2009 study, the lifespan of mice fed rapamycin were increased by 28\u201338% from the beginning of treatment, with a 9\u201314% total increase in maximum lifespan. Of particular note, the treatment began in mice aged 20 months, the human equivalent of 60 years [14] . This suggests the possibility of an effective anti-aging treatment for humans at an already-advanced age, as opposed to requiring a lifelong regimen beginning in youth. Numerous clinical trials using rapamycin analogs, involving both children and adults with tuberous sclerosis, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, lupus and other conditions, are under way in the United States [15] . Previously, it has been shown that inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), also known as FK506 binding protein 12-rapamycin associated protein 1 (FRAP1), may have therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD, Huntington\u2019s, and Parkinson\u2019s disease possibly through enhancement of autophagy (Reviewed in [16] ). However, we wondered whether rapamycin might also affect APP metabolism. Thus, in our current investigation we hypothesized that rapamycin would decrease A\u03b2 generation. Surprisingly however, rapamycin treatment of murine neuroblastoma cells overexpressing \u201cSwedish\u201d mutant APP695aa isoform (SweAPP N2a) and transgenic A\u03b2-overproducing mice (Tg2576) lead to increased A\u03b2 generation in vitro and in vivo . The neuroprotective amino-terminal APP cleavage product, soluble APP-\u03b1 (sAPP-\u03b1), likely produced by candidate \u03b1-secretase a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain-10 (ADAM-10; the principle CNS \u03b1-secretase [17] ) were both decreased after rapamycin treatment in vitro . In vivo , we found Tg2576 mice intraperitoneal (i.p.) injected with rapamycin (3 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks resulted in increased A\u03b2 levels associated with inhibition of \u03b1-secretase APP cleavage and decreased ADAM-10 at an average rapamycin plasma level of 169.7 \u00b1 23.5 ng/mL by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Reagents Rapamycin powder (99% purity by HPLC), was purchased from LC Lab (Woburn, MA). A\u03b2 and sAPP-\u03b1 ELISA kits were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against ADAM-17, BACE1, PS-1 (C-terminus antibody) and \u03b2-actin were purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies against the C-terminus (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and N-terminus (22C11, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) of APP were obtained. Antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 against A\u03b2 were purchased from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Antibodies against ADAM-10 were a kind gift from Dr. Bart De Strooper (KUL, VIP, Leuven, Belgium). 2.2 SweAPP N2a cell culture Murine N2a cells were purchased (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% Geneticin (G418; 40 mg/mL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were plated in 12-well collagen-coated culture plates at a density of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well. After overnight incubation, N2a cells were incubated in neurobasal media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 3 mM dibutyryl cAMP (Sigma) for terminal differentiation in preparation for treatment. 2.3 Mice Transgenic mice overexpressing \u201cSwedish\u201d mutant APP695aa isoform driven by prion promoter (line 2576, Tg2576) were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY). For i.p. administration of rapamycin, a total of 10 female Tg2576 mice were used: 5 mice received rapamycin, and 5 control mice received PBS. Beginning at 4 months of age, Tg2576 mice were i.p. injected with rapamycin (3 mg/kg) or PBS for 2 weeks (5 days/week), based on methods described previously [18] . Briefly, rapamycin (LC Labs) was initially dissolved in 100% EtOH, stored at \u221220 \u00b0C, and diluted in a vehicle solution containing 5% Tween 80, 5% PEG 400 (Sigma), and 4% EtOH immediately before injection. After 2 weeks, these mice were euthanized. Murine brains were isolated under sterile conditions on ice and placed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM \u03b2-glycerolphosphate, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF). Brains were then sonicated on ice for approximately 3 min, allowed to stand for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. Next we collected the supernatants for analyses of A\u03b2 levels in the brain according to methods described previously [19] . 2.4 ELISA Quantitation of total A\u03b2 and sAPP-\u03b1 was performed according to our published methods [19] . 2.5 Western blot Cultured cells or mouse brains were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer as described previously [20] . All antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Blots were developed using the Luminol reagent (Pierce). Densitometric analysis was done as described previously using a FluorS Multiimager with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) [19] . Antibodies used for western analysis included the C-terminal APP (1:500; Sigma), N-terminal APP (clone 22C11, Roche), N-terminal A\u03b2 6E10 (1:1000; Covance), ADAM-10 (1:500), ADAM-17 (1:500; Calbiochem), BACE1 (1:500; Calbiochem), PS-1 (C-terminal antibody; 1:500; Calbiochem), and \u03b2-actin (1:1500; as an internal reference control; Calbiochem). 2.6 Immunoprecipitation Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed for detection of sAPP-\u03b1 and A\u03b2 in cultured cell medium and for detection of \u03b2-CTF in cell lysates as previously [20] . Next, samples were subjected to western analysis as described above. 2.7 HPLC analysis Because rapamycin was administered i.p., we determined rapamycin concentration in mice blood before they were decapitated. Five-hundred to 800 mL of murine blood was extracted from the right ventricle. After centrifuge at 14,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C, rapamycin concentration in the serum was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All HPLC analysis was performed on Bio-Rad Dio Flow HPLC System with the following parameters. Flow rate: 0.8 mL/min, \u03bb (Wavelength): 278 nm, Column: Supelco C8, 5 \u03bcm pore size, (25 cm \u00d7 4.6 mm), Mobile Phase: [80:20:0.1%] \u2212 [ACN:H 2 O:acetic acid], Run time: 15 min, rapamycin Retention Time (RT): 9.7 min. Rapamycin was extracted from 100 \u03bcL of plasma using a triple sample volume of chloroform (300 \u03bcL) and vortexing for 3 min. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min to separate the chloroform layer, which was removed and evaporated under vacuum for 20 min. Sample residues were re-suspended into 400 \u03bcL of mobile phase for analysis. 2.8 Statistical analysis All data were normally distributed; therefore, in instances of single mean comparisons, Levene\u2019s test for equality of variances followed by a t -test for independent samples were used to assess significance. In instances of multiple mean comparisons, ANOVA was used, followed by post hoc comparison using Bonferonni\u2019s method were used. Alpha was set at 0.05 for all analyses. The statistical package for the social sciences release 18.0.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for all data analyses. 3 Results 3.1 Rapamycin promotes A\u03b2 generation from SweAPP N2a cells To examine the effects of rapamycin on A\u03b2 production, we treated SweAPP N2a cells with a wide dose range of rapamycin. We found that it increased A\u03b2 generation in cultured SweAPP N2a cells dose-dependently. At the 5 \u03bcM dose, rapamycin increased A\u03b2 generation by almost sevenfold compared to untreated controls by A\u03b2 ELISA ( Fig. 1 A). These results were also confirmed by immunoprecipitation and western blotting ( Fig. 1 B and C). 3.2 Rapamycin promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP in SweAPP N2a cells by inhibiting ADAM-10 expression To elucidate the mode of action of rapamycin on APP cleavage, we examined APP cleavage profiles after treatment of SweAPP N2a cells with rapamycin using ELISA, western and IP analyses. In concert with increased A\u03b2 generation, rapamycin treatment leads to enhanced generation of \u03b2-CTF and decreased sAPP-\u03b1 ( Fig. 1c, 2 A and B). These results suggest that \u03b1-secretase activity was inhibited. In order to test this, we characterized two important candidates of \u03b1-secretase, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (TACE), and found that only ADAM-10 was inhibited by rapamycin treatment ( Fig. 2 C), but ADAM-17 was not affected (data not shown). We also examined \u03b2-secretase (BACE-1) and PS-1 by western analysis, and found no difference in treated and control groups (data not shown). It should be noted that we did not observe significant changes in full-length holo APP expression after rapamycin treatment ( Fig. 1 C), suggesting that rapamycin treatment predominantly inhibits non-amyloidogenic APP cleavage, without modulating APP expression in SweAPP N2a cells. 3.3 Rapamycin increases A\u03b2 generation in Tg2576 mouse brains via ADAM-10 inhibition We validated in vivo whether rapamycin treatment could inhibit non-amyloidogenic APP processing (\u03b1-secretase proteolysis) and impact cerebral A\u03b2 levels in AD transgenic mice. We i.p. administered rapamycin to 4 month old Tg2576 mice, a well-established transgenic mouse model of AD [21] . Rapamycin was administered based on a treatment schedule that produces benefit in a tuberous sclerosis mouse model (3 mg/kg) [18] . Tg2576 mice at 4 months of age were i.p. injected with rapamycin or PBS 5 days/week for 2 weeks (10 days total). A\u03b2 levels were markedly increased in brain homogenate of Tg2576 mice treated with rapamycin versus PBS ( Fig. 3 A and B). Specifically, A\u03b2 levels are elevated by 79 \u00b1 20% above PBS-treated mice, by ELISA. In concert with the A\u03b2 elevation, we found that ADAM-10 in brain homogenate of Tg2576 mice was significantly inhibited in the rapamycin treatment group, compared with PBS controls ( Fig. 3 C). Because rapamycin was administered i.p., we determined rapamycin concentration in mice blood before they were decapitated. Five-hundred to 800 mL of murine blood was extracted from the right ventricle. After centrifuge at 14,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C, rapamycin concentration in the serum was determined by HPLC. Results showed the average plasma level of rapamycin was 169.7 \u00b1 23.5 ng/mL. 4 Discussion Traditionally used as an immunosuppressant, rapamycin appears to also display anti-aging properties in mice which would represent an important therapeutic for AD patients if similarly active in humans (reviewed in [16] ). This is not surprising considering its anti-inflammatory effects [22] . However, current investigation, originally aiming to determine expected beneficial effects of rapamycin on A\u03b2 generation suggest that rapamycin can promote A\u03b2 generation not only in vitro , but also in the Tg2576 mouse brain. This raises the question of whether rapamycin can exacerbate A\u03b2-related pathological changes in AD patients. Recently, contrary to our findings here, in the PDAPP mouse model of AD, investigators found reduced A\u03b2 in the brains of these mice. These findings were associated with enhanced autophagy [23] . However, despite these findings, and the anti-inflammatory effects of rapamycin which may delay aging processes and enhance clearance mechanisms (autophagy) in certain mice, rapamycin-associated A\u03b2 generation may ultimately prevail and lead to increased accumulation of toxic small oligomeric A\u03b2 species once clearance mechanisms in AD patients inevitably falter. Previous theories that A\u03b2 is only a marker of AD, and not an etiologic component of cognitive dysfunction, have changed in the 1990s with the articulation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis [1\u20134] . This is further epidemiologically supported by the identification of mutations in APP and PS-1,2 that increase A\u03b2 generation and are associated with early cognitive deficits [5\u20138] . Fundamentally, the amyloidogenic pathway provides for A\u03b2 peptides produced by the initial action of \u03b2-secretase (BACE-1,2) cleavage, which creates an A\u03b2-containing C-terminal fragment (CTF) known as \u03b2-CTF [24] . This proteolysis also generates an N-terminal, soluble APP-\u03b2 (sAPP-\u03b2) fragment, which is released extracellularly. Intracellularly, \u03b2-CTF is then cleaved by a multiprotein \u03b3-secretase complex that results in generation of A\u03b2 peptides and a smaller \u03b3-CTF [25,26] . Conversely, in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved at the \u03b1-secretase site, which results in the release of N-terminal sAPP-\u03b1 and the generation of \u03b1-CTF without A\u03b2 production [27,28] . Because of the limiting amount of APP in the cell and the failure to saturate the BACE pathway during APP overexpression, it is believed that the above-mentioned amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways compete for substrate in the process of APP proteolysis [29] . Therefore, it is often inferred that extracellular decrease of sAPP-\u03b1 can be taken as a direct evidence of inhibition of \u03b1-secretase and the associated non-amyloidogenic pathway. Our data suggest that rapamycin-associated A\u03b2 generation ( Fig. 1 A and B) corresponded to inhibition of the non-amyloidgenic \u03b1-secretase pathway; as sAPP-\u03b1 in cultured SweAPP N2a cell media was greatly reduced by rapamycin ( Fig. 2 A and B). Further, \u03b2-CTF, a product of the amyloidogenic pathway, was also elevated in these cells ( Fig. 1 C). Because APP metabolites arise from the coordinated actions of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-secretases, any change to these secretases will result in alterations in A\u03b2 generation. Thus, we next screened putative secretases including ADAM-10, ADAM-17, BACE-1, and PS-1 and found that A\u03b2 generation in rapamycin treated SweAPP N2a cells and Tg2576 mouse brains was associated predominantly with the inhibition of ADAM-10, an important candidate \u03b1-secretase in the central nervous system ( Figs. 2 and 3 C, data not shown). Dramatic reductions in the mature active form were observed after rapamycin treatment in vitro ( Fig. 2 C). Moreover, inhibition of \u03b1-secretase activity by rapamycin could be counteracted by \u03b1-secretase promoting green tea-derived epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; data not shown) [19] . How rapamycin inhibits ADAM-10 is currently a key question. What is known about rapamycin\u2019s mechanism of action comprises its ability to bind the cytosolic protein FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) in a manner similar to tacrolimus. However, unlike the tacrolimus-FKBP12 complex which inhibits calcineurin (PP2B), the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by directly binding the mTOR Complex-1 (mTORC-1) [12,30] . Combination therapy with doxorubicin and rapamycin has been shown to drive Akt-positive lymphomas into remission in mice. Akt signaling promotes cell survival in Akt-positive lymphomas and acts to prevent the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. Rapamycin blocks Akt signaling causing malignant cells to lose their resistance to the chemotherapy. Bcl-2-positive lymphomas \u2013 which effectively subvert Akt regulation \u2013 were completely resistant to rapamycin, as were eIF4E-expressing lymphomas [31\u201333] . Similarly, ADAM-10, an important player in progression of some cancers [34] , may be inhibited by rapamycin through down-regulation of mTOR/Akt signaling. Akt may be able to alter APP phosphorylation/maturation directly or through Shc, [35,36] thereby modulating substrate-mediated ADAM-10 activation [37] . Further evidence is required to support these proposed mechanisms. Recently, it was reported that rapamycin can exacerbate neurotoxicity of A\u03b2 peptides; and that the mTOR pathway is important for the survival of A\u03b2 exposed cells [38] . These previous studies, as well as our current data, suggest that although rapamycin possesses anti-inflammatory and life-extending properties in mice, it may have potential detrimental side-effects if used as monotherapy to treat AD patients.

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related disorder that affects cognition. Our previous studies showed that the neuroprotective fragment of amyloid procurer protein (APP) metabolite, soluble APP\u03b1 (sAPP\u03b1), interferes with \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1, \u03b2-secretase) cleavage and reduces amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) generation. In an attempt to identify approaches to restore sAPP\u03b1 levels, we found that human cord blood serum (CBS) significantly promotes sAPP\u03b1 production compared with adult blood serum (ABS) and aged blood serum (AgBS) in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing wild-type human APP. Interestingly, CBS selectively mediated the \u03b1-secretase cleavage of human neuron-specific recombinant APP in a cell-free system independent of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE; a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 [ADAM17]) and ADAM. Subsequently, using 3-step chromatographic separation techniques (i.e., diethylaminoethanol, size-exclusion, and ion-exchange chromatography), we purified and ultimately identified a CBS-specific fraction with enhanced \u03b1-secretase catalytic activity (termed \u03b1CBSF) and found that \u03b1CBSF has more than 3,000-fold increased \u03b1-secretase catalytic activity compared with the original pooled CBS. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of \u03b1CBSF markedly increased cerebral sAPP\u03b1 levels together with significant decreases in cerebral A\u03b2 production and abnormal tau (Thr) phosphorylation compared with the AgBS fraction with enhanced \u03b1-secretase activity (AgBSF) treatment in triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD) mice. Moreover, AgBSF administered intraperitoneally to transgenic mice with five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (5XFAD) via an osmotic mini pump for 6 weeks (wk) ameliorated \u03b2-amyloid plaques and reversed cognitive impairment measures. Together, our results propose the necessity for further study aimed at identification and characterization of \u03b1-secretase in CBS for novel and effective AD therapy.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represents a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders with similar core features of social and communication impairments, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Early synaptic dysfunction due to neuroinflammatory insults may underpin the pathogenesis of abnormal brain development in some of individuals with ASDs. As a critical component of the innate immune response, the complement system comprises both directly acting factors and factors that augment other components of the immune system. Beyond its involvement with innate immune responses in the brain, the complement system also plays important roles in neurodevelopment. Recent studies suggest involvement of complement component C1q in fundamental neurodevelopmental pathways and in maintenance and elimination of dendrites and synapses. The impact of aberrant complement system activity during critical windows of brain development may not only affect the local immune response but lead to atypical brain development. This review summarizes and critically analyzes the evidence of a role for the complement system in the pathogenesis of ASDs.",

Our previous studies have shown that cross-linking of CD45 with an anti-CD45 antibody markedly inhibits LPS-induced microglia activation. In order to determine which of the CD45 isoforms may be responsible for these effects, we have investigated the expression of CD45 isoforms on cultured microglial cells using flow cytometric analysis. Data reveal that CD45RB is the predominant isoform expressed in murine primary cultured microglial cells. Furthermore, incubation of these cultured cells with anti-CD45RB antibody results in a reduction of microglial activation induced by LPS as evidenced by TNF-alpha production. As a validation of these findings in vivo, brain homogenates from anti-CD45RB antibody (MG23G2)-injected animals that had been treated with LPS demonstrate a significant decrease in TNF-alpha levels compared to control mice treated with LPS plus vehicle. Taken together, these findings suggest that therapeutic agents that specifically stimulate the microglial CD45RB signaling pathway may be effective in suppressing microglial activation associated with several neurodegenerative disorders.",

Eukaryotic initiation factor 3c (EIF3c) plays an important role in protein translation and cancer cell growth and proliferation, but its role in human ovarian cancer is unclear. Our results showed that EIF3c silencing significantly upregulated 217 and downregulated 340 genes. IPA analysis indicated that the top differentially expressed genes are involved in \"Classical Pathways\", \"Diseases and Functions\" and \"Networks\", especially those involved in signalling and cellular growth and proliferation. In addition, eIF3c silencing inhibited cellular proliferation, enhanced apoptosis and regulated the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. In conclusion, these results indicate that by dysregulating translational initiation, eIF3c plays an important role in the proliferation and survival of human ovarian cancer cells. These results should provide experimental directions for further in-depth studies of important human ovarian cancer cell pathways.",

        "abstract": "Although considered an immunologically privileged site, the central nervous system (CNS) can display significant inflammatory responses, which may play a pathogenic role in a number of neurological diseases. Microglia appear to be particularly important for initiating and sustaining CNS inflammation. These cells exist in a quiescent form in the normal CNS, but acquire macrophage-like properties (including active phagocytosis, upregulation of proteins necessary for antigen presentation, and production of proinflammatory cytokines) after stimulation with inflammatory substances such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Recent studies have focused on elucidating the role of neurons in the regulation of microglial inflammatory responses. In the present study, we demonstrate, using neuron-microglial cocultures, that neurons are capable of inhibiting LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production by microglia. This inhibition appears to be dependent on secretion of substances at axon terminals, as treatment with the presynaptic calcium channel blocker omega-conotoxin abolishes this inhibitory effect. Moreover, we show that conditioned medium from neuronal cultures similarly inhibits microglial TNF-alpha production, which provides additional evidence that neurons secrete inhibitory substances. We previously demonstrated that the transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase CD45 plays an important role in negatively regulating microglial activation. The recent characterization of CD22 as an endogenous ligand of this receptor led us to investigate whether neurons express this protein. Indeed, we were able to demonstrate CD22 mRNA and protein expression in cultured neurons and mouse brain, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and antibody-based techniques. Furthermore, we show that neurons secrete CD22, which functions as an inhibitor of microglial proinflammatory cytokine production.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) plays conflicting roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, clearing \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) from the brain while also enhancing APP endocytosis and resultant amyloidogenic processing. We have recently discovered that co-expression of mutant LRP1 C-terminal domain (LRP1-CT C4408R) with Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells decreases A\u03b2 production, while also increasing sAPP\u03b1 and APP \u03b1-C-terminal fragment (\u03b1-CTF), compared with CHO cells expressing APPswe alone. Surprisingly, the location of this mutation on LRP1 corresponded with the \u03b1-secretase cleavage site of APP. Further experimentation confirmed that in CHO cells expressing APPswe or wild-type APP (APPwt), co-expression of LRP1-CT C4408R decreases A\u03b2 and increases sAPP\u03b1 and \u03b1-CTF compared with co-expression of wild-type LRP1-CT. In addition, LRP1-CT C4408R enhanced the unglycosylated form of LRP1-CT and reduced APP endocytosis as determined by flow cytometry. This finding identifies a point mutation in LRP1 which slows LRP1-CT-mediated APP endocytosis and amyloidogenic processing, while enhancing APP \u03b1-secretase cleavage, thus demonstrating a potential novel target for slowing AD pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The physiological capacity of peripheral tissues and organs in clearing brain-derived A\u03b2 and its therapeutic potential for AD remains largely unknown. Here, we measured blood A\u03b2 levels in different locations of the circulation in humans and mice, and used a parabiosis model to investigate the effect of peripheral A\u03b2 catabolism on AD pathogenesis. We found that blood A\u03b2 levels in the inferior/posterior vena cava were lower than that in the superior vena cava in both humans and mice. In addition, injected I labeled A\u03b240 was located mostly in the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and skin but very little in the brain; suggesting that A\u03b2 derived from the brain can be cleared in the periphery. Parabiosis before and after A\u03b2 deposition in the brain significantly reduced brain A\u03b2 burden without alterations in the expression of amyloid precursor protein, A\u03b2 generating and degrading enzymes, A\u03b2 transport receptors, and AD-type pathologies including hyperphosphorylated tau, neuroinflammation, as well as neuronal degeneration and loss in the brains of parabiotic AD mice. Our study revealed that the peripheral system is potent in clearing brain A\u03b2 and preventing AD pathogenesis. The present work suggests that peripheral A\u03b2 clearance is a valid therapeutic approach for AD, and implies that deficits in the A\u03b2 clearance in the periphery might also contribute to AD pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a complex pathological process usually results from abnormal microglial activation, thus, intervention in a microglial stimulation pathway could be a promising approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Luteolin is an important bioflavonoid possesses anti-inflammatory properties, which is widely studied over these years. Light emitting diode (LED) therapy is reported to be a potential therapeutic strategy for many diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about the anti-inflammatory effect of LED therapy on activated microglial cells, even less is known whether there is a synergistic anti-inflammatory effect exist in LED and luteolin therapy. In this study, we aimed to confirm the anti-inflammatory effect of luteolin and LED combination therapy in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. We showed that luteolin inhibited LPS-induced cytotoxicity, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production through modulation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in BV2 cells. In addition, LED therapy enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of luteolin. These results suggest that a synergistic effect between luteolin and LED could be a new effective therapy in relieving neuroinflammation.",

        "abstract": "Soluble amyloid precursor protein \u03b1 (sAPP\u03b1), a secreted proteolytic fragment of nonamyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, is known for numerous neuroprotective functions. These functions include but are not limited to proliferation, neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, neurogenesis, and neuritogenesis in cell culture and animal models. In addition, sAPP\u03b1 influences amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) production by direct modulation of APP \u03b2-secretase proteolysis as well as A\u03b2-related or unrelated tau pathology, hallmark pathologies of Alzheimeru0027s disease (AD). Thus, the restoration of sAPP\u03b1 levels and functions in the brain by increasing nonamyloidogenic APP processing and/or manipulation of its signaling could reduce AD pathology and cognitive impairment. It is likely that identification and characterization of sAPP\u03b1 receptors in the brain, downstream effectors, and signaling pathways will pave the way for an attractive therapeutic target for AD prevention or intervention. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "In the United States, Alzheimeru0027s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accompanied by substantial economic and emotional costs. During 2015, more than 15 million family members who provided care to AD patients had an estimated total cost of 221 billion dollars. Recent studies have shown that elevated total plasma levels of homocysteine (tHcy), a condition known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), is a risk factor for AD. HHcy is associated with cognitive decline, brain atrophy, and dementia; enhances the vulnerability of neurons to oxidative injury; and damages the blood\u2013brain barrier. Many therapeutic supplements containing vitamin B12 and folate have been studied to help decrease tHcy to a certain degree. However, a therapeutic cocktail approach with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, methyl B12, betaine, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have not been studied. This novel approach may help target multiple pathways simultaneously to decrease tHcy and its toxicity substantially.",

        "abstract": "Lithium has been marketed in the United States of America since the 1970s as a treatment for bipolar disorder. More recently, studies have shown that lithium can improve cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). However, the current United States Food and Drug Administration-approved lithium pharmaceutics (carbonate and citrate chemical forms) have a narrow therapeutic window and unstable pharmacokinetics that, without careful monitoring, can cause serious adverse effects. Here, we investigated the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy of LISPRO (ionic co-crystal of lithium salicylate and l-proline), lithium salicylate, and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3). We found that LISPRO (8-week oral treatment) reduces \u03b2-amyloid plaques and phosphorylation of tau by reducing neuroinflammation and inactivating glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 in transgenic Tg2576 mice. Specifically, cytokine profiles from the brain, plasma, and splenocytes suggested that 8-week oral treatment with LISPRO downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines, upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokines, and suppresses renal cyclooxygenase 2 expression in transgenic Tg2576 mice. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that LISPRO provides significantly higher brain lithium levels and more steady plasma lithium levels in both B6129SF2/J (2-week oral treatment) and transgenic Tg2576 (8-week oral treatment) mice compared with Li2CO3. Oral administration of LISPRO for 28 weeks significantly reduced \u03b2-amyloid plaques and tau-phosphorylation. In addition, LISPRO significantly elevated pre-synaptic (synaptophysin) and post-synaptic protein (post synaptic density protein 95) expression in brains from transgenic 3XTg-AD mice. Taken together, our data suggest that LISPRO may be a superior form of lithium with improved safety and efficacy as a potential new disease modifying drug for AD.",

We used transgenic mice expressing mutant human amyloid \u03b2-protein precursor and presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) to model cerebral amyloidosis. At 12 months of age, we orally administered EGCG and/or FA (30 mg/kg each) or vehicle once daily for 3 months. At 15 months, combined EGCG-FA treatment reversed cognitive impairment in most tests of learning and memory, including novel object recognition and maze tasks. Moreover, EGCG- and FA-treated APP/PS1 mice exhibited amelioration of brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular \u03b2-amyloid deposits and decreased abundance of amyloid \u03b2-proteins compared with either EGCG or FA single treatment. Combined treatment elevated nonamyloidogenic soluble APP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-secretase candidate and down-regulated amyloidogenic soluble APP-\u03b2, \u03b2-carboxyl-terminal APP fragment and \u03b2-secretase protein expression, providing evidence for a shift toward nonamyloidogenic APP processing. Additional beneficial co-treatment effects included amelioration of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptotoxicity. Our findings offer preclinical evidence that combined treatment with EGCG and FA is a promising AD therapeutic approach.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive decline of cognition and associated neuropsychiatric signs including weight loss, anxiety, depression, agitation, and aggression, which is particularly pronounced in the female gender. Previously, we have shown that a novel ionic co-crystal of lithium salicylate proline (LISPRO) is an improved lithium formulation compared to the carbonate or salicylate form of lithium in terms of safety and efficacy in reducing AD pathology in Alzheimer's mice. The current study is designed to compare the prophylactic effects of LISPRO, lithium carbonate (LC), and lithium salicylate (LS) on cognitive and noncognitive impairments in female transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mice. Female APPswe/PS1dE9 mice at 4\u00a0months of age were orally treated with low-dose LISPRO, LS, or LC for 9\u00a0months at 2.25\u00a0mmol lithium/kg/day followed by determination of body weight, growth of internal organs, and cognitive and noncognitive behavior. No significant differences in body or internal organ weight, anxiety or locomotor activity were found between lithium treated and untreated APPswe/PS1dE9 cohorts. LISPRO, LC, and LS prevented spatial cognitive decline, as determined by Morris water maze and depression as determined by tail suspension test. In addition, LISPRO treatment was superior in preventing associative memory decline determined by contextual fear conditioning and reducing irritability determined by touch escape test in comparison with LC and LS. In conclusion, low-dose LISPRO, LC, and LS treatment prevent spatial cognitive decline and depression-like behavior, while LISPRO prevented hippocampal-dependent associative memory decline and irritability in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is linked to oxidative stress, altered amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis, tau hyperphosphorylation and the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction can be a key promoter of all of these pathologies and predicts that restoration of mitochondrial function might be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. Therefore, in the present study, we tested the beneficial effect of a nutraceutical formulation Nutrastem II (Nutra II), containing NT020 (a mitochondrial restorative and antioxidant proprietary formulation) and pyrroloquinolinequinone (PQQ, a stimulator of mitochondria biogenesis) in 5XFAD transgenic mice. Animals were fed Nutra II for 12 weeks, starting at 3 months of age, after which behavioral and neuropathological endpoints were determined. The data from behavioral test batteries clearly revealed that dietary supplementation of Nutra II effectively ameliorated the motor deficiency and cognitive impairment of 5XFAD mice. In addition, Nutra II also protected mitochondrial function in 5XFAD mice brain, as evidenced by declined ROS levels and membrane hyperpolarization, together with elevated ATP levels and respiratory states. Interestingly, while Nutra II treatment only slightly reduced soluble A\u03b2 levels, this formulation significantly impacted tau metabolism, as shown by reduced total and phosphorylated tau levels of 5XFAD mouse brain. Taken together, these preclinical findings confirm that mitochondrial function may be a key treatment target for AD and that Nutra II should be further investigated as a potential candidate for AD therapy.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. In healthy individuals, amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by \u03b1-secretase, generating soluble \u03b1-amyloid precursor protein (sAPP\u03b1), which contributes neuroprotective functions in the neuronal environment. In contrast, in the neurodegenerative environment of AD patients, amyloid-\u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) of either 40 or 42 residues are generated by increased activity of \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase. These proteins amalgamate in specific regions of the brain, which disrupts neuronal functions and leads to cognitive impairment. Human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) have proven useful as potential immunomodulatory therapies in various models of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Our most recent work studied the impact of umbilical cord blood serum (CBS) on modulation of sAPP\u03b1 production. Heat-sensitive CBS significantly promoted sAPP\u03b1 production, indicating that heat-sensitive factor(s) play(s) a role in this process. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was used to determine the molecular source of \u03b1-secretase in purified CBS and aged blood serum (AgBS) fraction. Of the proteins identified, the subunits of C1 complex (C1q, C1r, and C1s) and alpha-2-macroglobulin showed significantly greater levels in purified \u03b1-CBS fraction (\u03b1-CBSF) compared with the AgBS fraction (AgBSF). Specifically, C1 markedly increased sAPP\u03b1 and alpha-carboxyl-terminal fragment (\u03b1-CTF) production in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas C1q alone only minimally increased and C3 did not increase sAPP\u03b1 production in the absence of sera. Furthermore, C1q markedly increased sAPP\u03b1 and \u03b1-CTF, while decreasing A\u03b2, in CHO/APPwt cells cultured in the presence of whole sera. These results confirm our initial assumption that APP \u03b1-secretase activity in human blood serum is mediated by complement C1, opening a potential therapeutic modality for the future of AD.",

        "abstract": "Lithium has been marketed in the United States of America since the 1970s as a treatment for bipolar disorder. More recently, studies have shown that lithium can improve cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the current United States Food and Drug Administration-approved lithium pharmaceutics (carbonate and citrate chemical forms) have a narrow therapeutic window and unstable pharmacokinetics that, without careful monitoring, can cause serious adverse effects. Here, we investigated the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy of LISPRO (ionic co-crystal of lithium salicylate and l-proline), lithium salicylate, and lithium carbonate (LiCO). We found that LISPRO (8-week oral treatment) reduces \u03b2-amyloid plaques and phosphorylation of tau by reducing neuroinflammation and inactivating glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 in transgenic Tg2576 mice. Specifically, cytokine profiles from the brain, plasma, and splenocytes suggested that 8-week oral treatment with LISPRO downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines, upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokines, and suppresses renal cyclooxygenase 2 expression in transgenic Tg2576 mice. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that LISPRO provides significantly higher brain lithium levels and more steady plasma lithium levels in both B6129SF2/J (2-week oral treatment) and transgenic Tg2576 (8-week oral treatment) mice compared with LiCO. Oral administration of LISPRO for 28 weeks significantly reduced \u03b2-amyloid plaques and tau-phosphorylation. In addition, LISPRO significantly elevated pre-synaptic (synaptophysin) and post-synaptic protein (post synaptic density protein 95) expression in brains from transgenic 3XTg-AD mice. Taken together, our data suggest that LISPRO may be a superior form of lithium with improved safety and efficacy as a potential new disease modifying drug for AD.",

Effects of the target current on morphology and phase of the Cr xN coatings were investigated. The contact resistance and corrosion resistance of the coatings was tested. The results show that the contact resistance between the modified 304 stainless steel and Toray carbon films is 22.65-24 m\u03a9/cm 2, within the package force of PEMFC. In the simulative environment of PEMFC (0.05 mol/L H 2SO 4 + 2 mg/L F - on 80\u00b0C), the corrosion current of modified bipolar plates is 0.5 \u00d7 10 -6 A/cm 2.

The most serious problems for c-BN film is high residual stress and low adhesion strength to a substrate. In order to improve the adhesion of the c-BN film, the boron implanted buffer layer was introduced to improve the interface state between the film and substrate. The experiment results showed that the boron implanted buffer layer can reduce the internal stress and improve the adhesion strength of the films obviously. The critical load of scratch test rises to 44.5\u00a0N, compared to 7.5\u00a0N of c-BN film on the unimplanted silicon. Then the composition and organization of the boron implanted layer was analyzed by XPS. And the influence of boron implanted layer on the internal stress and adhesion strength of c-BN films were investigated.",

        "abstract": "Cu/Ni multilayer films with sublayer thickness ( h ) ranging from 10 to 1000 nm were prepared on ANSI 1045 steel by brush plating of periodically changing layers of Cu and Ni. The microstructure, composition, microhardness and sliding wear properties against standard SiC ball under unlubricated condition were examined. It was found that the brush plated multilayer films are highly dense and free from porosity. A decrease in h results in smaller grain size and lower coefficient of friction. Both microhardness and wear resistance reach the maximum value when h = 20 nm. Although found with lower hardness compared with brush plated Ni monolayer coating, multilayer films with h ranging from 20 to 80 nm showed improved wear resistance. The increase in the wear resistance was attributed to the combined effect of strengthening of the layer structure and the lubricating of Cu. Research Highlights \u25ba Cu/Ni multilayer films were first fabricated using brush plating technique. \u25ba Tribological properties of brush plated Cu/Ni multilayer films were reported. \u25ba Correlations between sublayer thickness and coating properties were studied. Keywords Electrodeposition Brush plating Cu/Ni multilayers Friction and wear 1 Introduction Over the last few decades, multilayer films with sublayer thickness ( h ) near atomic dimension have attracted a lot of attention in both scientific and engineering communities, as improved techniques for preparing them were developed. These coatings were mainly produced by vacuum deposition [1\u20133] or electrodeposition from an aqueous solution [4\u20137] . These techniques, in most cases, offer excellent control of the structure, composition and sublayer thickness of the multilayered coating. The unique control of microstructure provided coatings with enhanced or novel behavior concerning their magnetic, electrical, optical and mechanical properties, which differ considerably from pure metals and homogeneous alloys [8\u201311] . Although vacuum deposition and sputtering often give excellent controlling of h , applications, especially for tribological use, are restricted because of the high cost and low efficiency. Electrodeposition has shown its advantage in view of the apparatus' simplicity and the ease of controlling the process parameters, especially for metallic multilayered structures\u00a0 [12] . Electrodeposited Cu/Ni multilayer has long been known for its enhanced hardness and strength compared to corresponding monolayer coatings [13] . Ruff et al. [14,15] found that Cu/Ni multilayer films deposited from sulfamate bath were more wear-resistant than Ni and Cu. Zhang and Xue [16] investigated the grain size strengthening and multilayer effect on wear-resistance for multilayers with h \u2265 10 nm. The brush plating technique, different from conventional bath plating, is an electrochemical process conducted with an electrolyte applied to the substrate by a so-called brush to form the adherent deposit [17] . Compact deposits with small grains are often easily fabricated in a brush plating process. Accordingly, such coatings are often found to be more wear-resistant than conventional electroplated ones [18,19] . Thus, improved tribological properties can also be expected in brush plated multilayer films. However, little work has been reported on preparing multilayer films using brush plating. In this paper, the authors aimed to deposit Cu/Ni multilayer coatings with different sublayer thickness on ANSI 1045 steel with brush plating technique. Structure of the multilayer, as well as tribological properties, including friction coefficient and wear resistance, were then characterized. Effect of the sublayer thickness on tribological behaviors is investigated. 2 Experimental The substrates used for the deposition were \u03a6 25.4 \u00d7 6.0 mm discs of ANSI 1045 steel, polished to a surface roughness less than 0.03 \u03bcm. Before the brush plating, all substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone for 10 min and rinsed with deionized water. At room temperature, Ni and Cu were brush plated alternatively from aqueous commercial nickel and ammoniacal copper electrolytes with the composition given in Tables\u00a01 and 2 , respectively. Specimens were rinsed with deionized water as soon as each single sublayer was deposited to make sure that the electrolytes were never polluted. Direct current was applied given by a DGN-3 rectifier for brush plating (AAFE, China). Deposition rates at different voltages, evaluated with the thickness growth per second, were measured to decide the current duration needed to acquire multilayer films with different sublayer thicknesses. The thickness of the alternate layers comprising the multilayer was always equal and the sublayer thicknesses of the multilayer films studied were 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 500 and 1000 nm. The total thickness of all coating was approximately 20 \u03bcm, always keeping Ni the top layer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were performed using Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope to study surface morphology, cross-sectional structures and wear scar of the deposits. Specimens for cross-sectional observation were dipped in aqua ammonia to etch Cu sublayer selectively. Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis was adopted to determine the elements content in the deposits. Elements and grain size of the multilayer films were determined using a D8 Bruker advance X-ray diffractometer (AXS, Germany). A fully calibrated nano indenter (Nano Test 600) was employed to measure the hardness of the deposits, with a load of 15 mN. The hardness values reported here represent an average of five different values taken in different locations of the specimens. The friction and wear tests were conducted under unlubricated condition on a \u2018ball on disk\u2019 wear tester (T11, Poland). A schematic presentation of the testing apparatus is shown in Fig.\u00a01 . The rotating lower disk specimen was the brush plated 1045 steel. The stationary upper ball specimen, was made from silicon carbide ceramic, with a diameter of \u03a6 = 6.35 mm and the surface roughness of R a = 0.012 \u03bcm. All the tests were conducted at a normal load of 2 N, a rotating radius of 10 mm, a total sliding distance of 90 m and a slide speed of 0.1 m/s. The wear and friction tests were conducted under laboratory atmosphere (room temperature, 25 \u00b1 3 \u00b0C, the relative humidity ranged from 50 to 70%). Wear volumes were calculated by measuring the wear trace using an optical microscope (with precision of 0.01 mm). Each test was repeated three times and the average was adopted as the experimental data. Prior to the testing, specimens were ultrasonic cleaned with acetone. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Deposition rate For an accurate control of the sublayer thickness, the deposition rate of both electrolytes at different plating voltages was recorded. Calculated deposition rate (thickness growth per second) was shown in Fig.\u00a02 . No obvious deposition of nickel was found when applied a voltage lower than 2 V. Similarly, Cu could not be deposited from the alkaline cooper solution until the voltage was higher than 1 V. These critical voltage values are connected with the critical deposition overpotential of each metallic ion. For both cases, deposition rate grew with increasing voltage gradually, reaching 45 nm/s at 8 V. Given a higher voltage, the value grew dramatically, reaching 166 nm/s for Ni and 187 nm/s for Cu, at 12 V. In the last phase, with high metallic ion concentration in the electrolyte, which makes sure the ion supply to the cathode surface, the deposition current experienced a rapid increase. However, it is difficult to control the sublayer thickness well in nano scale when the deposition is too fast. Thus, herein, the deposition voltage was kept at 4.0 V for sublayers with thickness above 80 nm and 2.5 V for those with thickness lower than 40 nm. Monolayer coatings of Cu and Ni were also prepared at 4.0 V for comparison. 3.2 SEM analysis Cross-sectional SEM views of films with different sublayer thicknesses ( h ) are shown in Fig.\u00a03 . The lower side in these photos is the substrate. Relative dark bands represent etched Cu sublayers while bright ones the Ni sublayers. It can be seen that both sublayers of Cu and Ni are uniform in thickness except for some flaws induced by the substrate in the internal region. The surface morphology of the substrate played an important role in the initial growth of the deposits. For multilayer films with larger h , the first layers are liable to cracks and other flaws ( Fig.\u00a03 (a)). As the deposits grew thicker, these flaws were soon covered by following sublayers, which are smooth and dense. No crack was observed in multilayer films with lower h . Moreover, most sublayers in the outer area were found to be uniform and parallel to the substrate surface, which is different from those prepared with traditional electrodeposition. In the latter case, sublayers are usually not that uniform in outer region but mostly uniform in internal region of the film [16] . The desirable throwing power of brush plating can be attributed to the friction movements between the anode and the substrate surface, which cleaned the surface and weakened the concentration polarization. Cross-sectional EDS analysis was conducted to determine the elements content in the deposits. Results are shown in Table\u00a03 . The similar content of the two metallic elements in the films of different h confirmed that the thickness ratio was well controlled during the brush plating process. Surface morphology of multilayer films with sublayer thickness varies from 20 nm to 160 nm is shown in Fig.\u00a04 . Surface morphology seems to be well connected with h . Generally, the size of the cauliflower-like grain colony on the surface decreases with h . An average grain colony size of about 800 nm was observed in the coarse surface of multilayer film with h = 160 nm. Fine smooth surface was found in deposits with h as low as 20 nm, with an average grain colony size of about 40 nm. 3.3 XRD analysis The phase composition in the brush plated deposits was characterized by XRD analysis. Fig.\u00a05 shows the XRD pattern of the Cu/Ni multilayer film with h = 20 nm. For comparison purpose, the pattern of brush plated Cu coating is also given in Fig.\u00a06 . Different from the pattern of the single layer Cu coating, the main peaks in the pattern of the multilayer film are the combination of both Cu and Ni peaks. Similar diffraction patterns containing doublet-like peaks with a similar intensity were acquired from all specimens, confirming the existence of distinctive copper and nickel layers, each with its own lattice parameter. Similar peak intensity of Cu and Ni in the pattern of the multilayer film suggests the similar content of the two metals, which shows good consistence with the results of EDS. It is noticed that the brush plated coatings on polycrystalline 1045 steel substrate had strong [111] texture, which is in consistence with previous reports by Zhang [16] and Ghosh [11] . The (111) planes are known to have high atomic density and low surface energy in the Cu and Ni face-centered-cubic crystal system. Thus, these structures of Cu/Ni multilayer film, with predominance of crystals oriented in (111) planes parallel to the substrate, would be beneficial for the coatings obtaining good tribological properties. A broadening of diffraction peaks was observed in the patterns of multilayer films, compared to that of Cu, which is attributed to the decrease in grain size. Scherrer's formula was used to calculate the grain size: (1) D = 0. 9 \u03bb / cos \u03b8 \u03b2 where D is the grain size, \u03bb the wavelength of X-ray used ( \u03bb = 0.154 nm), \u03b2 the broadening of diffraction line measured at half of its maximum intensity (FWHM) and \u03b8 the corresponding angle. Experimental enlargement due to the apparatus was checked with standard reference material (NIST 640 silicon) and a correction of the experimental data was made using Jade software. \u03b2 of the (111) planes was taken for the calculation. Fig.\u00a07 shows the calculated grain size of Cu and Ni in multilayer films with different h , compared with that of brush plated Ni and Cu monolayer coatings. All brush plated deposits were found to be nano crystalline coatings. Grain size in multilayer films was lower than that in single layer coatings. For both Cu and Ni sublayers, the value was found to decrease gradually with h . Further grain refinement in the multilayered structure can be attributed to the alternative deposition of Cu and Ni, which interrupted the grain growth but promoted the nucleation. This result is in accordance with the SEM surface morphology observations of the coatings. The multilayer with smaller grain size ( D Cu = 11.6 nm, D Ni = 6.7 nm) showed much smoother surface ( Fig.\u00a04 (d)) than that with larger size ( D Cu = 17.0 nm, D Ni = 11.6 nm, Fig.\u00a04 (a)). Such a small grain size contributes to the smooth surface morphology and also may have a beneficial effect on the improvement of the mechanical properties of the coating. 3.3 Microhardness Due to the modulation wavelength of micro-nano scale, when measuring the hardness of brush plated multilayer films, the influence of load has to be taken into account. Finite element analysis [20] showed that measured value was stable when the depth of indentation was no less than 7 times of the modulation wavelength. It was also found the influence of the substrate could be neglected when the depth of indentation was equal to or slightly lower than 1/10 of the film thickness. Thus, the surface microhardness of the deposits was measured by nano indenter. All specimens showed homogeneous surface hardness, with an average deviation less than 5% for all 5 measured values for each specimen. The relationship between the average hardness of the coating and sublayer thickness is shown in Fig.\u00a08 , compared with brush plated Cu and Ni monolayer coatings. The average hardness of the multilayer films was found to be in the range of 3.0\u20133.7 GPa. Several studies have shown a strengthened hardness of multilayer Cu/Ni structure compared with single layer Ni coatings [16] . However, as shown in our experiments, all brush plated multilayer films showed a hardness lower than that of Ni (4.8 GPa) only higher than that of Cu (2.8 GPa). It was also observed that the hardness increases gradually with the decreasing sublayer thickness, meeting the maximum value when h = 20 nm. The strengthening of multilayered structure was mostly attributed to the inhibition of dislocation movements by the interface. Several mechanisms have been put forward. (a) Image force theory by Koehler [21] claimed that the difference of Young's modulus near the interface induced the image force, which acted on the dislocations. (b) Orowan [22] insisted that the resistance of the dislocation movement was from the interface, that is, the alternating stress field formed by coherent stress and thermal stress at the interface. (c) Hall\u2013Petch theory claimed that the hardness and the modulation wavelength follow the Hall\u2013Petch relationship [23,24] . (d) Cheng's mismatch dislocation theory [20] pointed out that the hindrance of mismatch dislocation to other dislocations gives rise to the hindrance of the interface. For a further understanding of the strengthening mechanisms, the relationship between microhardness and h \u22121/2 is described in Fig.\u00a09 . It can be seen that when h > 80 nm, the relationship between microhardness and h \u22121/2 followed the linear Hall\u2013Petch equation. The data were least-squares straight-line fitted with intercept HV 0 = 2.89 GPa, the rate of slope K HV = 0.477 GPa/nm \u22121/2 . In case that h < 80 nm, the hardness and h followed a nonlinear relationship. A maximum value of 3.72 GPa was found when h = 20 nm. Further decrease of h reduced the microhardness. Similar results were reported by Zhang, et al. [16] in the study of electrodeposited Cu/Ni multilayer films using single bath method. When h > 80 nm, from the Hall\u2013Petch formula HV = HV 0 + K HV \u00b7h \u22121/2 , the value of HV 0 (2.89 MPa) is similar to the microhardness of Cu (2.84 MPa). It indicates that the deformation of the multilayer films was mainly caused by the dislocation gliding in the Cu sublayers, which are relatively soft. Strengthening was mostly from the hindrance of the interfaces. According to breeding and pile-up theory of dislocation, the hardness increases with the increasing interface density. This can be achieved by lower down the modulation wavelength, or sublayer thickness. However, when h = 10 nm, microhardness decreases to a lower value of 3.3 GPa, which is similar with the value when h = 160 nm. It is known that the mutual solubility of Cu and Ni is very high. For the multilayer film with h = 10 nm, due to the impact of the interface width, the layered structure is not as distinct as those with higher h . The resistance to the dislocation movement is thus lower in this coating, which gave rise to the decrease in microhardness. Thus, throughout the sublayer thickness range in our experiments, the correlation of y = a x 2 + b x + c between the microhardness ( y ) and h \u22121/2 ( x ) is more likely to be followed, as shown in Fig.\u00a09 . 3.4 Tribological properties Coefficient of friction (COF) as a function of the sublayer thickness h is shown in Fig.\u00a010 . COF of all multilayer films were found to be lower than that of the single layer Ni coating (0.85) but higher than that of the Cu coating (0.25). COF decreases with the decreasing of h , with the maximum value of 0.82 ( h = 1000 nm), which is similar to that of Ni, and the minimum value of 0.33 ( h = 10 nm), which is slightly higher than that of Cu. Wear-caused volume loss is shown in Fig.\u00a011 . The wear volume was calculated with the following formula: (2) \u0394 V = 2 \u03c0 r \u22c5 R 2 arcsin d 2 R \u2212 1 2 d R 2 \u2212 1 4 d 2 where \u0394 V is the wear volume, R is the radius of the SiC ball, d is the width of the wear scar and r is the rotating radius. It is noticed that the wear loss was in good dependence with the sublayer thickness h . For all cases with h \u2265 20 nm, the wear volume decreased with the decreasing of h . When h \u2265 160 nm, the wear resistance of multilayer films higher than that of Cu but lower than that of Ni showed a simply combined property of the two constituent metals. When 80 nm \u2265 h \u2265 20 nm, the wear volume of the multilayer films was lower than that of both single layer coatings. The minimum value was achieved when h = 20 nm, which is only 1/12 of that of Cu and 1/3 of that of Ni. Multilayer films with sublayer thickness in nano scale showed an improved wear resistance. However, for the multilayer film with the sublayer thickness as low as 10 nm, the value increased to 0.12 mm 3 , even higher than that of the film with h = 160 nm. This might be attributed to the decreased microhardness when h = 10 nm. The wear of the deposits is a complex process which is dependent on various factors. For Cu/Ni multilayer films, the wear resistance was mainly affected by numerous interfaces in the deposits and the different mechanical and tribological properties of Cu and Ni. Fig.\u00a012 gives wear scar morphologies of multilayer films with different h , compared with Cu and Ni coatings. Films with h > 80 nm showed similar wear scar morphology with that of pure Ni, indicating grinding abrasion as the main mechanism. However, the deposit with h = 20 nm exhibited the characteristic of laminar tearing, suggesting an improved wear resistance. EDS analysis of the wear scar showed that the adhered debris were mostly Cu. The debris was from Cu sublayer in the deposits. Transfer and adhesion of Cu during the wear process formed a lubricating layer between surfaces of the specimens and the counterpart, which resulted in the decrease of COF. Two main factors seem to cause the improved wear-resistance of Cu/Ni multilayer films: (a) an increase in the interface number of multilayers by decreasing the sublayer thickness, which generated the barriers of dislocation glide through the interface between adjacent layers of copper and nickel; and (b) a decrease in the grain size of the multilayer by decreasing the sublayer thickness, as verified by the XRD analysis. Moreover, tribological properties of brush plated Cu/Ni multilayers are more likely to be determined by combined effect of both interface effect and Cu-introduced lubrication. Generally, dislocation density increases with the decreasing of h , which implies better wear resistance. However, when h is lower than the critical thickness, because of the well mutual solubility between Cu and Ni, diffusion across the interface weakens the interface effect. 4 Conclusions Cu/Ni multilayer films with various sublayer thickness were brush plated on the 1045 steel. From experiments and analysis above, following conclusions have been reached: (1) Smooth and uniform Cu/Ni multilayer films can be fabricated using brush plating technique. The growth of multilayers had a predominance of crystals oriented with (111) planes parallel to the substrate. The grain size of multilayer films became small with the decrease in the sublayer thickness. (2) All multilayer films show microhardness higher than that of Cu monolayer coating but lower than that of Ni monolayer coating. Brush plated multilayers exhibit an intermediate property compared to Cu and Ni monolayer coatings. Above the critical sublayer thickness value of 20 nm, the microhardness of the multilayers increased with decreasing sublayer thickness. (3) All multilayer films show an average COF lower than that of Ni monolayer coating but higher than that of Cu monolayer coating. The average COF decreased when h became smaller. Deposits with sublayer thickness varies from 20 to 80 nm showed improved wear-resistance, due to increased number of interfaces, which give rise to improved hardness, as well as the lubricating effect of Cu.

For the purpose of improving adhesion, the BN X implanted buffer layer was introduced between the HSS and c-BN film deposited by the RF-magnetron sputtering. The influence of the BN X buffer layer on adhesion was investigated and the results showed that when the N/B ratio of the buffer layer is about 1:1, the adhesive strength of c-BN film to the HHS substrate reached the maximum, about 28.47\u00a0N, which is sixteen times higher than that of c-BN film deposited without the buffer layer. According to the XPS analysis, the surface of buffer interlayer was mainly in BN phase, which is the main reason to reduce the internal stress and improve the adhesion strength of c-BN films.",

In the experiments, the supported AlCl3 catalysts used for the redistribution reaction of methyltrichlorosilane and low-boiling residues in a fixed bed reactor to produce dimethyldichlorosilane and trimethylchlorosilane were prepared by using an impregnation-evaporation-alcination method. The pretreatment methods of activated carbon (AC), which is used as the catalyst support, and the reaction conditions affecting the redistribution reaction were experimentally investigated. It is found that the AlCl3 catalyst supported on the AC pretreated by high temperature will have a higher activity for the redistribution reaction. It is due to the high temperature pretreatment will enlarge the pore size of the AC and will increase its specific surface area. The optimum reaction conditions for the redistribution reaction were determined as follows: the mass ratio of methyltrichlorosilane to low-boiling residues is 2.0~3.0, the reaction temperature 310\u2103 and LHSV 1.5h?1. The AC supported AlCl3 catalyst requires only a mild reaction conditions and it shows a good catalytic stability in the redistribution reaction.",

The conversion reaction of methyltrichlorosilane in a stirred bed reactor by the methylaluminumchloride method with aluminum powder and methylchloride as raw materials was systematically investigated. It was found that after an introduction period of about 100 min, the reaction reached a steady state with good activity in the absence of catalysts by the aid of mechanical stirring in the reactor which promoted the elimination of oxidized layer on the surface of the aluminum powder and speeded up the surface renewal process. Increasing the stirring speed and raising the reaction temperature to the optimum levels were favorable to the conversion reaction. The molar proportion of methyl chloride to methyltricholrosilane (m) in the feed had great effect on the reaction conversion and product composition. The concentrations of dimethyldichlorosilane and trimethylchlorosilane in the product were relatively higher while the reaction conversion of methyltrichlorosilane was lower when m<2.0, the trimethylchlorosilane was the main conversion product when m=2.0, and tetramethylsilane became the main product at a higher reaction conversion of methyltrichlorosilane when m>2.0. The reaction mechanism was discussed by analysing the SEM surface morphology of the aluminum powder before and after reaction.",

Electron microscopy images, XRD curves, thermogravimetric analysis and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were used to identify the core-shell structure. The inner core consisted of superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which made the nanocomposite magnetically removable. The outer shell was constructed with silica molecular sieve which provided large surface area and ordered tunnels for the sensing probe, accelerating analyte adsorption and transportation. The rhodamine based sensing probe emission increased with the increasing Hg(II) concentration, showing emission \"Off-On\" effect, which could be explained by the structural transformation from a non-emissive one to a highly emissive one. The influence from various metal ions and pH values was also investigated, which suggested this structural transformation could only be triggered by Hg(II), showing high selectivity and linear response. The Hg(II) sensing nanocomposite could be regenerated after usage. The response time was slightly compromised and could be further improved.",

Increasing topdressing ratio and the times, and cropping economic plants was suggested to improve nutrient utilization and reduce residue. Reducing chemical fertilizer input moderately can prevent soil acidification. Increasing organic fertilizer, especially manure, and applying tobacco straw bioorganic manure and green manures were proposed to realize tobacco-ecological nutrient circulation.",

Pulmonary hemorrhage and edema were found.There were significant differences in terms of lung compliance and airway resistance between control group and normal group before pressure release(P<0.01).Lung compliance and airway resistance within one hour and at one hour after crush release were not significantly different from that before crush release in the control group(P>0.05) or in the treatment group(P>0.05).Plasma ET-1 concentrations 5 min before release and in BALF in 1 h after crush release were significantly different from those in normal group(P<0.01).ET-1 concentrations 5 min and 1 h after crush release were not significantly different from that 5 min before crush release(P>0.05).ET-1 concentrations and BALF in the control group were not significantly different from those in the treatment group(P>0.05).Conclusion There may be a correlation between lung airway resistance and serum ET-1.But the release from crush injury can not significantly impact lung airway resistance,lung compliance,and the ET-1 concentrations in the plasma and BALF.Bosentan (Ro24720203),a ET-1 antagonist,can not improve lung function in a short period of time and reduce mortality in rabbit.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To search for a safe lateral screw trajectory on the reconstructed 3D computer imaginary body based on thin-slice CT scanning of vertebra dentata.Methods:Four isolated dry dentata and eight fresh specimens were enrolled in this experiment.Consecutive CT images of each sample were scanned with 0.6 mm in thickness and interval distance.With help of UG software(NX edition),3D reconstruction body of vertebra dentata axis was built up.The screws in various diameters and shapes meeting special demands were simulated,then positioned according to imaginary trajectory and readjusted until satisfactory entrance point and inclination of needling.Results:CT images showed that the lateral cortex at transverse foramen region(anterior region of lateral arch) was obvious thinner.Some specimen possessed a hole for nutrient artery,which induced congenital deficient in the lateral cortex of vertebral arch.Distinguished by transverse process,the route orientation of lateral vertebral arch in anterior region did not parallel to that in posterior region;and the orientation in upper part of cervical foramen region was different from that in median and lower parts.By simulating different entrance point and end point in imaginary axis with computer,a satisfactory screw trajectory can finally be obtained,which parallel neither to the orientation of upper part of anterior portion nor to that of posterior portion,but was largely restricted by the orientation of median and lower part of anterior portion of lateral arch.Conclusions:Existence of nourishing vessel hole at the lateral cortex of anterior region of lateral arch of axis makes the cortex of lateral arch congenital deficient.The conventional methods to judge the screw safe trajectory is questionable.A safe screw trajectory of lateral arch of axis can be got by UG-software simulating methods,and appropriate length and diameter of screw could be determined preoperatively.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate which fusion technique provides the best clinical and radiological outcome for adult lumbar IS.A systematic review was performed. MEDLINE databases and reference lists of selected articles were searched. Inclusion criteria stated that the studies had to be controlled and that they compared clinical and radiological outcomes of various fusion techniques for treating adult IS. Exclusion criteria were use of only one treatment and non-English language articles. Two reviewers independently extracted relevant data from each included study. Statistical comparisons were made when appropriate.Nine studies that compared two surgical approaches to IS were included in this systematic review. Three were prospective studies, and six were retrospective studies. Two studies compared ALIF with instrumented PLF and ALIF with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation, two studies compared ALIF and TLIF, and five studies compared PLIF and PLF. ALIF was superior to other techniques regarding restoration of disc height, segmental lordosis, and whole lumbar lordosis. TLIF had lower complication rates. ALIF combined with PLF showed lower nonfusion rates than other techniques. However, there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between any two techniques.Compared to other fusion techniques, TLIF shows fewer complications, ALIF shows better sagittal alignment, and circumferential fusion showed better fusion rates. It was difficult to make recommendations about the optimal approach because of the methodological variance in the publications.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, lumbar spinal surgery is performed with bilateral pedicle screw fixation to provide stability as the fusion heals. However, many studies have reported that unilateral pedicle screw fixation is as effective as bilateral constructs. To compare the clinical outcomes, complications, and surgical trauma between the two techniques for treatment of degenerative lumbar diseases, we conducted a meta-analysis.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases for relevant controlled studies up to August 2013 that compared unilateral with bilateral fixation for the treatment of degenerative lumbar diseases. We independently performed title/abstract screening and full-text screening. A random effects model was used for heterogeneous data; otherwise, a fixed effect model was used, pooling data using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes.A total of 12 articles (865 participants) were eligible. Overall, there were significant differences between the two groups for blood loss (MD = -171.73, 95 % CI = -281.70 to -61.76; p = 0.002), operation time (MD = -66.02, 95 % CI = -115.52 to -16.51; p = 0.009), and fusion rate (OR = 0.50, 95 % CI = 0.26-0.96; p = 0.004). However, there were no significant differences in hospital stay (MD = -4.44, 95 % CI = -13.37 to 4.50), ODI (MD = -0.09, 95 % CI = -0.59 to 0.42; p = 0.74), JOA (MD = 0.18, 95 % CI = -0.77 to 1.14; p = 0.71), VAS (MD = -0.04, 95 % CI = -0.16 to 0.08; p = 0.49), SF-36 (PF: MD = -1.11, 95 % CI = -4.38 to 2.17, p = 0.51; GH: MD = 1.22, 95 % CI = -2.17 to 4.60, p = 0.48; MH: MD = -0.22, 95 % CI = -3.83 to 3.38, p = 0.90) and complications (OR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 0.72-1.85; p = 0.56).This meta-analysis shows that there was significantly less blood loss in unilateral group and less operating time; however, the fusion rate was significantly higher in the bilateral group. The outcomes of hospital stay, ODI, JOA, VAS, SF-36 score, and complications are similar in the two groups.",

        "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN.: Technical case report. OBJECTIVE.: To investigate a new concept and surgical technique in the treatment of unstable Jefferson fractures, which preserves the motion of upper cervical spine, avoiding fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: The management of unstable Jefferson fractures remains controversial. Conservative treatment usually involves a long time of immobilization in halo vest, whereas surgical intervention generally performs fusion, eliminating the range of motion of upper cervical spine. METHODS.: Two patients with unstable Jefferson fractures were surgically treated via direct posterior C1 lateral mass screws compression reduction and osteosynthesis technique, aiming at restoring the C0-C2 height and maintaining the vertical ligamentous tension for C0-C1-C2 complex stability despite the incompetent transverse ligament, achieving physiologic repair instead of traditional fusion. The clinical and radiographic results were documented. RESULTS.: The postoperative CT showed that C1 lateral mass screws were well positioned. At 1-year follow-up, plain radiographs, and CT scan revealed no implant failure, good cervical alignment, and bony healing of the fractures; no C1-C2 instability was observed on the flexion-extension radiographs. The patients were completely pain-free, with full range of motion of the cervical spine. CONCLUSION.: The ideal treatment of unstable Jefferson fractures is expected to preserve the function of C0-C1-C2. Unstable Jefferson fractures involve the concomitant failure of the vertical ligamentous tension because of the loss of C0-C2 height. Reduction of the displaced lateral masses to restore the C0-C2 height and maintain the ligamentous tension is the key to the surgery. Direct posterior C1 lateral mass screws compression reduction and osteosynthesis is a valid technique, avoiding fusion of upper cervical spine. Copyright \u00a9 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a novel lumbar approach named extraforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (ELIF), a newly emerging minimally invasive technique for treating degenerative lumbar disorders, using a digitalized simulation and a cadaveric study.The ELIF surgical procedure was simulated using the Mimics surgical simulator and included dissection of the superior articular process, dilation of the vertebral foramen, and placement of pedicle screws and a cage. ELIF anatomical measures were documented using a digitalized technique and subsequently validated on fresh cadavers.The use of the Mimics allowed for the vivid simulation of ELIF surgical procedures, while the cadaveric study proved the feasibility of this novel approach. ELIF had a relatively lateral access approach that was located 8-9 cm lateral to the median line with an access depth of approximately 9 cm through the intermuscular space. Dissection of the superior articular processes could fully expose the target intervertebral discs and facilitate a more inclined placement of the pedicle screws and cage with robust enhancement.According to the computer-based simulation and cadaveric study, it is feasible to perform ELIF. Further research including biomechanical study is needed to prove ELIF has a superior ability to preserve the posterior tension bands of the spinal column, with similar effects on spinal decompression, fixation, and fusion, and if it can enhance post-fusion spinal stability and expedites postoperative recovery.",

        "abstract": "In vitro biomechanical study of cervical intervertebral distraction.To investigate the forces required for distraction to different heights in an in vitro C5-6 anterior cervical distraction model, focusing on the influence of the intervertebral disc, posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL), and ligamentum flavum (LF).No previous studies have reported on the forces required for distraction to various heights or the factors resisting distraction in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).Anterior cervical distraction at C5-6 was performed in six cadaveric specimens using a biomechanical testing machine, under four conditions: A, before disc removal; B, after disc removal; C, after disc and PLL removal; and D, after disc and PLL removal and cutting of the LF. Distraction was performed from 0 to 10 mm at a constant velocity (5 mm/min). Force and distraction height were recorded automatically.The force required increased with distraction height under all four conditions. There was a sudden increase in force required at 6-7 mm under Conditions B and C, but not D. Under Condition A, distraction to 5 mm required a force of 268.3\u00b138.87 N. Under Conditions B and C, distraction to 6 mm required <15 N, and further distraction required dramatically increased force, with distraction to 10 mm requiring 115.4\u00b110.67 N and 68.4\u00b19.67 N, respectively. Under Condition D, no marked increase in force was recorded.Distraction of the intervertebral space was much easier after disc removal. An intact LF caused a sudden marked increase in the force required for distraction, possibly indicating the point at which the LF was fully stretched. This increase in resistance may help to determine the optimal distraction height to avoid stress to the endplate spacer.",

        "abstract": "This is a technical note and review of the literature.We propose to describe a revised surgical technique of C1 lateral mass screw insertion with protection of C1-C2 venous sinus surrounding the C2 nerve root.During C1 lateral mass screw insertion and in posterior C1-C2 fixation, iatrogenic injury of C1-C2 venous sinus results in bleeding, which is troublesome. Appropriate management of the venous sinus in this region is critical to successful surgery in this complex anatomic region.We reviewed 48 patients who underwent posterior C1-C2 fixation at our institution between September 2001 and October 2008. Twenty-four atlas screws were inserted by the originally described C1 lateral mass screw technique (group A), and 28 through a revised posterior arch and lateral mass screw technique (C1 transpedicular screw) (group B). The final group of 44 atlas screws was placed with our newly revised technique (group C).Bleeding of venous sinus was encountered in 3 group A, 2 group B, and 1 group C atlas screw insertions. The incidence rate was 12.50% (A), 7.14% (B), and 2.27% (C). Statistical comparison showed no significant difference between the groups. All the cases were followed for a mean period of 28.1 month. Four patients in group A complained of postoperative numbness in occipitocervical region. No patients in group B or group C voiced this complaint. A high fusion rate was found in all 3 groups with no signs of implant failure.Bleeding of C1-C2 venous sinus is vigorous and frustrating. The revised technique we describe provides theoretical and practical protection of venous sinus. In addition, the firm bony purchase of screws afforded by this technique contributes to achieving stabilization of the upper cervical spine and a high fusion rate.",

        "abstract": "Both anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) and anterior cervical corpectomy with fusion (ACCF) are used to treat cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), however, there is considerable controversy as to whether ACDF or ACCF is the optimal treatment for this condition. To compare the clinical outcomes, complications, and surgical trauma between ACDF and ACCF for the treatment of CSM, we conducted a meta-analysis.We conducted a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases, searching for relevant controlled trials up to July 2013 that compared ACDF and ACCF for the treatment of CSM. We performed title and abstract screening and full-text screening independently and in duplicate. A random effects model was used for heterogeneous data; otherwise, a fixed effect model was used to pool data, using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes.Of 2157 citations examined, 15 articles representing 1372 participants were eligible. Overall, there were significant differences between the two treatment groups for hospital stay (M =\u200a-5.60, 95% CI =\u200a-7.09 to -4.11), blood loss (MD =\u200a-151.35, 95% CI =\u200a-253.22 to -49.48), complications (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.73) and increased lordosis of C2-C7 (MD = 3.70, 95% CI = 0.96 to 6.45) and fusion segments angles (MD = 3.38, 95% CI = 2.54 to 4.22). However, there were no significant differences in the operation time (MD =\u200a-9.34, 95% CI =\u200a-42.99 to 24.31), JOA (MD = 0.24, 95% CI =\u200a-0.10 to 0.57), VAS (MD =\u200a-0.06, 95% CI =\u200a-0.81 to 0.70), NDI (MD =\u200a-1.37, 95% CI \u200a=\u200a-3.17 to 0.43), Odom criteria (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.60 to 1.30) or fusion rate (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.34 to 4.11).Based on this meta-analysis, although complications and increased lordosis are significantly better in the ACDF group, there is no strong evidence to support the routine use of ACDF over ACCF in CSM.",

There were 7 males and 4 females with an average age of 36 years (range, 18-47 years). All cases had numbness in little finger and ring finger. The disease duration varied from 3 to 18 months (7 months on average). Nine cases had atrophy in the first dorsal interosseous muscle and hypothenar muscles. The preoperative electromyography showed that the ulnar nerve conduction velocity (NCV) were slowed down at elbow, which was (27.0 +/- 1.5) m/s.All incisions healed by first intention, and no complication occurred. Eleven cases were followed up 6-37 months (19 months on average). All cases had normal sensation after 1 month of operation. The muscle strength was obviously improved in 11 cases after 3 months postoperatively (grade 4 in 7 cases and grade 3-4 in 4 cases). The postoperative electromyography showed that the NCV was obviously improved, which was (43.5 +/- 9.5) m/s, showing significant difference when compared with preoperative one (P < 0.05). According to Amadio' efficacy appraisal standard, the results were excellent in 7 cases and good in 4 cases.The method of endoscopic ulnar neurolysis and minimal medial epicondylectomy has the advantages of safety, convenient manipulation, small incision, and early recovery for cubital tunnel syndrome with ulnar nerve subluxation.",

Distraction was performed for 5 teeth, and distractive torque of each tooth was recorded.The torque increased with distraction height under all conditions. There was a sudden increase in torque at the 4th tooth under Conditions B and C, but not D. Under Condition A, distraction to the 3rd tooth required 84.8\u00b113.3 cN\u00b7m. Under Conditions B and C, distraction to the 3rd tooth required <13 cN\u00b7m, and further distraction required dramatically increased torque. Under Condition D, no marked increase in torque was recorded.Distraction of the intervertebral space was much easier after disc removal. An intact LF caused a sudden marked increase in the force required for distraction, possibly indicating the point at which the LF was fully stretched. This increase in resistance may help to determine the optimal distraction height to avoid excessive stress to the endplate spacer. The remodeled Caspar retractor in present study may provide a feasible and convenient method for intraoperative measurement of distractive resistance.",

In searching the world literature on this topic, we found 27 cases of intradural cervical disc herniation in all.Clinical history, physical examination, and radiographic findings of two patients with intradural cervical disc herniation were described, and corpectomy was performed in both cases. A review of the literature was completed.The outcome of one case was gratifying, and at a 36-month follow-up, nearly a full recovery was obtained. But the other's condition was disappointing, whose postoperative MRI demonstrated high signal intensity in the spinal cord and adhesion of spinal cord to the posterior margin at C4 level.Intradural cervical disc herniation is relatively rare, and the two additional cases updated the number of this condition to 29. It remains difficult to definitively diagnose the disease before surgery, but some indirect signs may indicate the cases. Corpectomy under a microscope as the first option in treatment of this disease is recommended once it is highly diagnosed. The pathogenesis of intradural cervical disc herniation remains to be further investigated. We presume that biochemical factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis.",

The diagnosis was degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis in 84 cases of grade I, and 66 cases of grade II. There were 88 males and 62 females. Preoperatively, at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively, the pain was evaluated with visual analogue scale (VAS) scoring system and therapeutic effect was observed with modified Prolo scoring system.In complications, dural tear happened in 3 cases, biological glues were used for dural tear sealing and neither cerebrospinal fluid leak was found. One case suffered from intervertebral Infection and muscle weakness of foot was found in one case, either was cured after symptomatic treatment. Operative time averaged 160 minutes (120-280 min). Estimated blood loss averaged 210 ml (100-450 ml). The postoperative follow-up ranged from 6 to 36 months (averaged 15.2 months). Preoperatively,at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively, VAS scores were respectively 7.9 +/- 2.1, 2.2 +/- 0.6, 3.2 +/- 1.1 (P < 0.01). The rate of excellent and good was 98.67% (148/150) according to modified Prolo scoring system.Microendoscopic surgery transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion technique is indicated for lumbar vertebral instability, localized intervertebral disc disorder and lumbar spondylolisthesis with stenotic nerve root or tube below grade II. This technique has advantages of minimal invasion and early functional recovery.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To evaluate the feasibility and reliability of C1 lateral-mass screw-C2 pedicle screw and crosslink compression fixation for Jefferson fracture. Methods Seventeen patients with atlas fracture, 12 males and 5 females, aged 42. 5 (25-67), 4 of which with unstable atlas fracture, were treated. 11 cases underwent C1 lateral mass and C2 pedicle screws and crosslink fixation, 6 of which had axial instability and rupture of atlas transverse ligament, 1 had C2 laminal fracture, and the other 4 had axial instability. With the assistant of regional anatomy study and fluoroscopy the C1 lateral mass screw and C2 pedicle screw were inserted properly. Connecting rods were applied into the two screws on each side. Crosslink between the two rods were applied, compressing to achieve the realignment of the C1 lateral mass fracture and C0-C1-C2 into anatomical position. C1-C2 fusions with posterior bone graft were performed in the patients with axial instability or transverse ligament discontinuity. Results The operative time ranged from 90 to 176 min with an average of 124 min. The intra-operative blood loss ranged from 270 to 1200 ml with an average of 432 ml. Fluoroscopic examination was used for 18 seconds on average. There were no neurological deficits, vertebral artery related complications or other complications in all the patients. No neurological deficit was aggravated after the patient's mobilization with brace 5 days after operation. One case of vertebral artery rupture happened because of the use of electrocautery. The bleeding was stopped by the use of hemostatic sponge and bone cement without causing cerebral hemodynamic deficit. X-ray examination showed bone fusion and stability in all the patients three months after the operation. The restoration of the C2 fracture was confirmed by CT scan. Conclusion Osteosynthesis of the atlas by C1 lateral-mass screw-C2 pedicle screw and crosslink compression fixation is an ideal option for C1 burst fracture with or without rupture of transverse ligament. The procedure allows a physiological reconstruction of the C0-C1-C2 joint and short segmental solid fusion for Jefferson fracture.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To study the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of diaphragm function in the patients with upper cervical spinal cord injuries with magnetic stimulated MEP.Methods:12 patients with upper cervical spinal cord injuries were performed with the transcranial and transcervical magnetic stimulator of type Mag \u2160(Dantec,Denmark).The MEP was recorded through the electrode,which was inserted into the diaphragm along the superior border of the 8th rib and the anterior axial line.The relation between the changes of the diaphragm and the respiratory function was studied.The other 10 healthy volunteers were adopted as control group.Results:The respective latent periods of the MEPs and the CMCT were all lengthened in the 12 patients.There was a significant difference compared with ttat of the control group (P<0.05).The latent periods of the transcervical MEPs in the early stage of the injury had no obvious change compared with that of the control group,but it prolonged in the late period compared with that of the control group.Conclusion:The longer the early latent period of the cortex,the greater possibility the patients will suffer respiration failure.The patients with the obvious prolongation of the latent period of the MEP in the diaphragm transcervically can only be dependent on the respirators and the diaphragm stimulator can be installed at the later stage.",

There were 62 cases of odentoid malformation, 54 cases of odentoid fracture or rupture of transverse ligament, 22 cases of subluxation and rotation. All cases were treated using Gallie's technique. Six cases were also fixed with transarticular screws, and protected with Philadelphia collar. Other patients were fixed with plaster paris brackets. The followed-up period was 1 to 12 years with an average of 3 year and 5 months.According to Sumi's criteria, excellent 70 cases (50.7%), good 40 cases (29.0%), fair 15 cases (10.9%), poor 13 cases (9.4%). 9 cases with bone graft postponed fusion were cured by enhance external-fixation. 2 cases with nonunion were treated with revision surgery. Complication of cord injury happened in 1 case.Gallie's fusion technique is an effective method to manage the atlanto-axial instability or dislocation. Skull distraction before operation and reliable external-fixation post operative are important assistant measures. Key points for successful operation are careful wiring or cable traversing, decortication of posterior arc of C1, and maintaining the physiological height between C1 and C2 posterior arc. Indications and objectives should be conformed before revision surgery for failure cases.",

From the entry point 8 mm away from the midline at the inferior margin of the lamina, titanium lag screws of 35 - 45 mm long and 3.5 mm in diameter were placed at 300 upward and outward and tighted through the lysis, bone graft and the superior and lateral aspect of the pedicle. Extra match bone graft was placed around the surface of defect, an high intensity Nilon wire tension band between the cap of the screw and the basis of transverse process was constructed before wound closure and suction drainage. The patients were immobilized with plaster brace of Paris for 2 months.Average operation time was (10 +/- 55) minutes, and average blood loss was 170 ml. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 36 months (mean 17 months), and cases of 22 lysis healed within 3 months.Technique of direct bone graft repair with lag screw and tension band fixation for the treatment of adolescence spondylolysis is simple, safe and reliable. Combined biomechanical and biological processes, it is less invasive but advantageous in preserving the motion in the affected segment.",

        "abstract": "The Maoduan Pb-Zn-Mo deposit is in hydrothermal veins with a pyrrhotite stage followed by a molybdenite and base metal stage. The Re-Os model ages of five molybdenite samples range from 138. 6 \u00b1 2. 0 to 140. 0 \u00b1 1. 9 Ma. Their isochron age is 137. 7 \u00b1 2. 7 Ma. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb dating of the nearby exposed Linggen granite porphyry gave a 206Pb/ 238U age of 152. 2 \u00b1 2. 2 Ma and the hidden Maoduan monzogranite yielded a mean of 140. 0 \u00b1 1. 6 Ma. These results suggest that the intrusion of the Maoduan monzogranite and Pb-Zn-Mo mineralization are contemporaneous. \u03b4 34S values of sulfide minerals range from 3. 4\u2030 to 4. 8\u2030, similar to magmatic sulfur. Four sulfide samples have 206Pb/ 204Pb = 18. 252-18. 432, 207Pb/ 204Pb = 15. 609-15. 779, and 208Pb/ 204Pb = 38. 640-39. 431, similar to the age-corrected data of the Maoduan monzogranite. These isotope data support a genetic relationship between the Pb-Zn-Mo mineralization and the Maoduan monzogranite and probably indicate a common deep source. The Maoduan monzogranite has geochemical features similar to highly fractionated I-type granites, such as high SiO 2 (73. 7-75. 2 wt.%) and alkalis (K 2O + Na 2O = 7. 8-8. 9 wt.%) and low FeO t (0. 8-1. 3 wt.%), MgO (~0. 3 wt.%), P 2O 5 (~0. 03 wt.%), and TiO 2 (~0. 2 wt.%). The granitic rocks are enriched in Rb, Th, and U but depleted in Ba, Sr, Nb, Ta, P, and Ti. REE patterns are characterized by marked negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu * = 0. 2-0. 4). The Maoduan monzogranite, having ( 87Sr/ 86Sr) t = 0. 7169 to 0. 7170 and \u03b5 Nd(t) = -13. 8 to -13. 7, was probably derived from mixing of partial melts from enriched mantle and the Paleoproterozoic Badu group in an extensional tectonic setting. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

        "abstract": "Kunlunguan pluton, located in the southwest part of the Nandan-Kunlunguan granite belt, Guangxi, is mainly composed of biotite granite. Petrography and chemical compositions show that it belongs to high-K calc-alkaline series characterized by high silicon, is enriched in alkali and aluminum but depleted in phosphorus and titanium. Its SiO2 contents range from 68.13% to 72.61%, while K2O/Na2O ratios and A/CNK values vary from 1.28 to 1.69 and 0.72 to 1.28 respectively, ascribed to a suite of metaluminous to intensively peraluminous rock. Ga, Rb, Th, U and Pb elements are enriched in the intrusion while Ba, Nb, Sr, P and Ti depleted. REE is characterized by obvious negative anomalies with Eu/Eu* 0.53-0.73 and exhibits right-dipping \"V\" patterns with LREE enrichment. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating yields a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 93\u00b11 Ma (MSDW=1.7) for the Gumin unit of the pluton, implying its Late Cretaceous intrusion time. Mineralogy and geochemistry confirm that the Nandan-Kunlunguan granite belt is an important aluminous A-type granite belt in the South China, controlled by northwestward Nandan-Kunlunguan deep fault. Petrology, major and trace element features display that the pluton intruded in a post-collisional extensive tectonic setting. These results, combined with Late Cretaceous tectonic environment and regional stress field matching relationship in the studied area, indicate the A-type granite action is due to back-arc extension related to high angle subduction of the ancient Pacific plate which is caused by Indian plate northward movement. This granite belt and those granite or alkaline rocks in the coastal areas of Zhejiang-Fujian provinces represent the two A-type granite belts under a matching tectonic system.",

With the help of preciously published isotopic\n ages of some typical gold deposits and their related rocks in China, the authors have discussed and quantified the distribution\n characteristics and scope of the TGDM. Statistical analyses and Kolmogorov tests showed that mineralizing events are either\n contemporaneous with or slightly postdate their cognate magma. The TGDM conforms with normal distributions at a 0.05 confidence\n level and clusters between 0 and 16.0 Ma with a mean of 7.0 Ma. Thus, if the TGDM of CGD is less than 16.0 Ma, it is reasonable\n to consider, with the aid of other evidence, the possibility of its comagmatic genetic affiliation. The authors also emphasized\n that to get a precise time gap it is necessary to strengthen the diagenesis-mineralization geological background of the deposits\n studied, and to pay attention to the study of time gap in combination with trace elements and isotope tracing.",

        "abstract": "Jinchanggouliang region, which consists of Jinchanggouliang, Erdaogou and Xiaoerdaogou gold deposits, is located in the north of North China Craton (NCC) and south of Inner Mongolia-Daxinganling orogenic belt. Numerous early Mesozoic diorites and diorite porphyries occurred and yielded LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb age of 228\u00b11 Ma (MSWD=0.26) in the region. Both diorites and diorite porphyries are dominated by shoshonitic rocks, which contain SiO2 ranging from 51.22% to 68.48% and MgO from 1.35% to 8.13%, and are characterized by high contents of Na O2O+K O2O and Al O2O3 but low concentrations of P O2O5. These rocks are enriched in LREE, LILE but depleted in HFSE. All samples possess uniform (87Sr/86Sr)i isotopic ratios (0.704 95-0.705 92) but relatively wider range of \u03b5Nd (t) (-0.2 to -9.5) and T2DM ages (1.02-1.7 Ga). These results indicate that the magma source derived from mixing of lithospheric mantle and lower crust melt. Diagrams of major and trace elements reveal that dykes formed in transitional environment between land arc and intra-plate. Combined with some new discoveries in the neighborhood, such as dyke swarms, alkaline intrusive complex and A2-type granite, this study proposes that NCB had completed the collision with Siberia plate in Late Triassic and the north of NCC went into a post-orogenic extension stage.",

        "abstract": "The Maoduan lead-zinc polymetallic deposit,located in uplift area between the Jiangshan-Shaoxing and Zhenghe-Dabu deep faults in southwestern Zhejiang Province,is one of typical lead-zinc polymetallic deposits in this region.Re-Os dating of 5 molybdenite separated from the Maoduan lead-zinc polymetallic deposit gave model ages from 138.6\u00b12.0 Ma to 140.0\u00b11.9 Ma.These data yielded an isochron age of 137.7\u00b12.7 Ma with MSWD=0.7,and a weighted average model age of 139.0\u00b10.8 Ma (MSWD=0.5).This result is in good agreement with the Maoduan concealed monzogranite,indicating that Pb-Zn polymetal mineralization was related to granite crystallization.According to the precise Re-Os ages we have reported and previous studies,we interpret the Maoduan Pb-Zn deposit formed in an extensional setting related to lithospheric extension during the Early Cretaceous in South China.Meanwhile,we also point out that 140\u00b17 Ma may be another important time range of tungsten-molybdenite-lead-zinc polymetallic mineralization in South China.",

        "abstract": "Zircon U-Pb ages, major and trace element and Sr, Nd and Pb isotope compositions of the Duimiangou (DMG) quartz monzonite from the Chifeng region on the northern North China Craton (NCC) were studied to investigate its derivation, evolution and geodynamic significance. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb dating yields an emplacement age of 128\u00b11Ma for this intrusion, with numerous Mesozoic inherited zircons clustering at 219\u00b112Ma and 161\u00b13Ma, along with some ancient zircons with ages of 2.5Ga, 1.77Ga and 324Ma. Bulk-rock analyses show that this intrusion is characterized by variable SiO 2 (63.4-69.4wt.%), Al 2O 3 (14.5-16.3wt.%), Na 2O+K 2O (8.01-8.95wt.%), and Mg # (41.3-48.0). They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements without significant Eu anomalies (mostly between 0.89-1.10), and depleted in heavy rare earth elements and high field strength elements, with high Sr/Y (63.7-101.7) and (La/Yb) N (20.5-31.0) ratios. The DMG intrusion formed in an intracontinental extensional setting contemporaneous with the formation of pull-apart basins, metamorphic core complexes and intense magmatism, rather than in a convergent margin. It has homogeneous Sr (( 87Sr/ 86Sr) i=0.7059-0.7066), Nd (\u03b5 Nd(t)=-6.2 to -7.2) and Pb (( 206Pb/ 204Pb) i=17.289-17.375, ( 207Pb/ 204Pb) i=15.359-15.463, ( 208Pb/ 204Pb) i=37.130-37.472) isotope compositions. Sr-Nd isotope modeling results, plus relatively young Nd model ages (1522-1618Ma) and the presence of relict zircons, suggest that this intrusion could have originated from crustal contamination of newly formed basaltic melts derived from asthenospheric mantle, accompanied by fractional crystallization of K-feldspar, biotite, apatite, Fe-Ti oxides and minor hornblende and plagioclase. Thus, the DMG adakite-like intrusion may record the magmatic event associated with underplating of asthenospheric magma in an intracontinental extensional environment, and both asthenospheric magma underplating and lithospheric delamination may have played important roles in the lithospheric thinning of the northern NCC. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Widespread dike swarm, including diorite-, monzonite-porphyry and lamprophyre, intruded in the altered breccia gold deposits\n along basin marginal faults, Guocheng, Jiaodong Peninsula. Petrography exhibits biotite enclaves in amphibole phenocrysts\n and the presence of acicular apatites in these dikes. Electron probe microanalyses (EPMA) show that the amphibole and clinopyroxene\n phenocryst\u2019s mantle in diorite porphyry and lamprophyre respectively has sharply higher MgO (Mg#) and Cr2O3 contents in contrast to their cores. The plagioclase phenocryst in monzonite porphyry has reverse zoning. These results indicate\n that the magma mixing between mantle-derived mafic and crust-derived felsic magmas occurred in the original process of the\n dikes. Zircon cathodoluminescence (CL) images show well-developed magmatic oscillatory zones and the acquired LA-ICP-MS zircon\n U-Pb weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages are 114\u00b12 Ma (MSDW=1.5) for monzonite porphyry (GS1) and 116\u00b11 Ma (MSDW=0.8) for diorite porphyry (GS2), respectively.\n Earlier magmatic events in the northwest Jiaodong Peninsula represented by some inherited or captured zircons also occur in\n these dikes. Magmatic zircons from GS1 and GS2 display consistent chondrite-normalized REE patterns and Nb/Ta values, implying\n that they may share a similar or same source. HREE enrichment and obvious negative Eu anomalies of these zircons preclude\n garnet presented in their source. Our results, combined with preciously published data, indicate that dike intrusion and gold\n mineralization among quartz vein, altered tectonite and altered breccia gold deposits are broadly contemporaneous throughout\n the Jiaodong Peninsula. These also imply that the intensive crust-mantle interaction and asthenospheric underplating had occurred\n in the Early Cretaceous in the Peninsula, together with foundering of lower crust in the early Mesozoic, representing the\n different stages of lithosphere thinning in the North China Craton (NNC).",

LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating reveals three major age groups of 2500 Ma (n = 2), 253 \u00b1 7 Ma (n = 5) and 227 \u00b1 1 Ma (n = 9). The inherited ages of 2500 Ma, contemporary with the Archaean NCC continental growth, imply that crustal material was involved in the magma source. The igneous zircons with a concordia age of 227 \u00b1 1 Ma may record the emplacement age of the JCGL dykes. Both diorite and diorite porphyry exhibit a wide range of SiO2 and MgO contents and are characterized by high concentrations of Na2O+K2O and Al 2O3, and low abundances of P2O5 and TiO2. They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements without significant Eu anomalies, and depleted in high-field-strength elements; all are categorized as shoshonitic rocks. All samples show a narrow range of Sr isotope compositions with initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios from 0.70394 to 0.70592, variable \u03b5Nd(t) values (1.1 to -12.0) and TDM2 ages of 913-1972 Ma. Their Pb isotope compositions form continuous variation trends and plot in the fields between enriched mantle 1 (EM1) and lower continental crust (LCC). The above results suggest that the JCGL dykes studied could have been derived from mixing of lower crust, lithospheric mantle of the NCC and ascending asthenospheric melt in a post-orogenic extensional geodynamic setting. These shoshonitic dykes, together with the geochronological data of regional ENE-trending retrograded eclogites, ophiolites, continental arc magmatic belt, A-type granite, alkaline intrusions and metamorphic core complex from the northern NCC and Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) suggest that closure of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean (i.e. stage of pre-collision to collision) had completed during latest Permian to earliest Triassic time, and that the CAOB was subsequently tectonically dominated by post-orogenic extensional regimes. The involvement of asthenospheric melt in the magma source implies that the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) of the NCC had been modified, and the onset of lithospheric destruction and thinning beneath the northern NCC may have occurred in Middle-Late Triassic time as a result of post-orogenic subducting slab detachment and lithospheric delamination. \u00a9 Copyright Cambridge University Press 2011.",

        "title": "Formation of wulong mafic dikes via mixing of enriched lithospheric mantle-derived and crustal magmas, Eastern North China craton",
        "abstract": "Zircon U-Pb age and geochemical data are reported for the Wulong dike swarms from the Liaodong Peninsula, NE China. The studied dikes include diorite, lamprophyre, and dolerite. Together with previous dating, the diverse rocks have a peak age of ca. 120-125 Ma. They are marked by inversely zoned phenocrysts with Mg- and Cr-rich rims, and they exhibit mantle-like signatures (i.e., high Mg-Cr-Ni) associated with prominent subduction-type element enrichments. The early diorites have relatively radiogenic Sr ((87Sr/86Sr)i p 0.7134-0.7143) and less radiogenic Nd (\u03b5Nd(t) p -14.3 to -11.0) isotopes coupled with high and variable MgO (Cr, Ni) contents, indicating that they were mainly derived from ancient lower crust with subordinate contributions of enriched lithospheric mantle. The transitional lamprophyres are characterized by high Rb/Sr ratios (0.22-0.54) but low initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.7069-0.7093), moderate negative \u03b5Nd(t) values (- 14.4 to -12.6), and low promantle elements (such as Mg-Cr-Ni), reflecting that juvenile lower crustal components with a short residence time were significantly added to their source as well. The late dolerites possess extremely high Mg, Cr, and Ni concentrations, less radiogenic Sr ((87Sr/86Sr)i p 0.7076-0.7082) and much radiogenic Nd (\u03b5Nd(t) p -4.2 to -2.4) isotopes, suggesting that they mainly originated from an enriched mantle source with minor involvement of old lower crustal materials. Petrographic and chemical evidence points to an origin of these rocks by mixing of enriched mantle-derived and lower crustal magmas. The rapid progressive change of source compositions first indicates a complex, multistage hybridization process, and second, it shows an extensional tectonic regime during magma generation. \u00a9 2013 by The University of Chicago.",

In order to investigate their genesis, source characteristics and tectonic background of diagenesis, the petrology and geochemistry are reported in this paper. In terms of major elements, the dikes are attributed to the potassic calc-alkaline series as a whole. They possess high Mg, Fe, Al and low Ti contents. The dikes are rich in LILE and LREE, and relatively depleted in HFSE, suggesting a production of partial fusion (9.52%) of disseminated amphibole peridotite of enriched mantle. The magma might undergo fractional crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene, hornblende and weak plagioclase during the diagenesis process, which however is not obviously contaminated by crust materials in the emplacement process. Meanwhile, the dikes are formed in intraplate environment but possess the geochemical features of continental marginal arc calc-alkaline basalt, implying their relationship to the Pacific Plate subduction and Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous thinning event in the lithosphere of the North China Block, especially the sinistral strike-slip extension of the Tanlu fault zone.",

        "abstract": "The Huaixi copper-gold deposit, located in depression area between the Zhenghe-Dapu and Changle-Nan'ao deep faults in southeastern Zhejiang Province, is a typical hydrothermal vein filling-metasomatic Cu-Au polymetallic deposit. The Caomen K-feldspar granite porphyry pulton is the dominant intrusion in the deposit. Petrography and chemical compositions show that it belongs to shoshonite series characterized by high silicon, and it is enriched in alkali and iron but depleted in phosphorus and titanium. Its SiO2 contents range from 75.64% to 78.00%, while K2O and K2O/Na2O ratios vary from 5.38% to 5.92% and 1.94 to 2.72 respectively. Ga,Rb, Th, U and Pb elements are enriched in the intrusion while Ba, Nb, Sr, P and Ti are depleted. REE is characterized with obvious negative anomalies with Eu/Eu* 0.06-0.13 and exhibits right-dipping \"V\" patterns with LREE enrichment. Its mineralogy and geochemistry are consistent with those of Late Cretaceous alkaline granites in the coastal areas of Zhejiang-Fujian. This study offers the first highly precise dating of the diagenesis and mineralization in the deposit. The dating of zircon from the Caomen alkaline granite pulton determined by LA-ICP-MS yields age of 102\u00b11 Ma (MSDW=1.3), while Rb and Sr isotopic dating of fluid inclusions in quartz of the Huaixi copper-gold deposit yields isochron age of 101\u00b12 Ma. The results suggest that Cu-Au mineralization was consistent with granite crystallization. The ages of diagenesis and mineralization provide an important chronological constraint for the close genetic relationship of the deposit and the Caomen intrusion. The Huaixi Cu-Au deposit, originated from back-rc extensional tectonic-eat event related to high angle subduction of the ancient Pacific plate, caused by northward movement of the Indian plate, is corresponding to the time of the third large-scale mineralization regionally in the Mesozoic.",

        "title": "Origin of dyke swarms by mixing of metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle-derived and lower crustal magmas in the Guocheng fault belt, Jiaodong Peninsula, North China Craton",
        "abstract": "Cretaceous dyke swarms are widespread in the Guocheng fault belt, Jiaodong Peninsula, eastern North China Craton (NCC). Elemental analyses show that these dykes are classified as high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic series, and are characterized by high MgO (up to 10.33wt%; Mg#<69.8), Cr (<571ppm) and Ni (<235ppm) at low silica contents. They are enriched in LILEs (e.g. Sr, Ba, K and Pb) and LREEs, depleted in HFSEs (e.g. Nb-Ta, Zr-Hf, Ti and P), and possess relatively radiogenic Sr (initial 87Sr/86Sr=0.7078 to 0.7116) and Nd [\u03b5Nd(t)=-20.8 to -13.5] and much less radiogenic Pb (206Pb/204Pb=17.13 to 17.56) isotope signatures. These data, combined with inversely zoned amphibole and pyroxene phenocrysts, suggest a hybrid origin for the Guocheng dykes. The inferred magma evolution is dominated by repeated injection of basic magma from metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) into a lower crustal reservoir of intermediate-felsic composition. This refertilized lithospheric mantle source, probably together with its overlying enriched lower crust, was formed by subduction-related fluid metasomatism in the Palaeoproterozoic, which resulted from final cratonization of the NCC at ca. 1.8Ga during assembly of Columbia supercontinent. Our observations also imply that similar mixed magma system with oxidized and sulphur-rich signatures may be the key to the formation of hydrothermal polymetal deposits and the potential target for mineral exploration in some undiscovered areas. \u00a9 2012 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The Liuyuan area, which is located on the southern margin of the Beishan orogenic belt, develops abundant Early Paleozic granitoids.\n SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating yielded a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 421\u00b18 Ma for the Liuyuan granodiorite (Zhao Zehui et al., 2007), implying its Late Silurian intrusion. Geochemical\n compositions showed that the Liuyuan granodiorite is characterized by high SiO2 (65.01%\u201367.31%), A12O3 (17.17%\u201318.05%) and Na2O (Na2O/K2O=1.67\u20131.87) but low Mg# contents calculated as 100\u00d7Mg2+/(Mg2++\u03a3Fe2+) from 28.77 to 31.15, as well as being enriched in Sr (472\u00d710\u22126\u2013517\u00d710\u22126) but depleted in Yb (1.2\u00d710\u22126\u20131.42\u00d710\u22126) and Y (12.8\u00d710\u22126\u201314\u00d710\u22126). The REEs are characterized by right-inclined patterns with LREE enrichment, HREE depletion and slightly negative Eu anomalies\n (Eu/Eu*=0.91\u20130.97). Major and trace elements indicate that the granodiorite is an adakite. The Nb/Ta values of the granodiorite\n vary from 10.80 to 18.01 and Nb/U from 6.32 to 10.09, both lying between the values of the crust and the mantle. The rock\n has low \u025bNd(t) values (\u22122.5\u2013\u22120.8) and high I\n Sr (0.706321\u20130.706495). Geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic compositions indicate that the Liuyuan granodiorite is possibly derived\n from partial melting of thickening lower crust, related to mantle underplating. The Yb-Ta and Y+Nb-Rb discriminant diagrams\n imply the Liuyuan granodiorite intruded in a local extensional tectonic setting during late collision. Combined with previous\n studies on geochronology, geochemistry and tectonic setting of granitoids, we interprete that the constraint of this adakite\n in the Liuyuan area indicates that the tectonic setting may have transformed from collision to extension during the Early\n Devonian.",

        "abstract": "The Shilu iron deposit is located in western section of the Wuzhishan Fold Belt, Hainan island.In this region, numerous intermediate-basic dikes dominated by diorite-porphyrite occurred. The dating of zircon from diorite-porphyrite dikes determined by LA-ICP-MS yields age of 248\u00b11 Ma (MSWD=0.4), maybe bimodal intrusion with contemporary alkali-rich granites. Diorite-porphyrite dikes are dominated by shoshonitic rocks, which have SiO2 varying from 49.18% to 55.25%, Al2O3 from 14.36% to 16.75%, FeOt from 5.98% to 10.07% and MgO ranging from 3.80% to 5.43%. These dikes are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and low rare earth elements (LREE) but depleted in high field strength element (HFSE).The Nb/Ta values of diorite-porphyrite vary from 15.33 to 17.80, Zr/Hf and La/Nb from 36.00 to 45.23 and 2.59 to 8.62, respectively.Two samples have (206Pb/204Pb)t=18.087-18.483, (207Pb/204Pb)t=15.473-15.589 and (208Pb/204Pb)t=38.272-38.817, similar to the data of contemporary alkali-rich granites. Geochemical and Pb isotopic compositions indicate that these dikes are possibly derived from enriched mantle and slightly contaminated with crust.Hf/3-Th-Ta and Zr-Zr/Y discriminant diagrams imply these diorite-porphyrite dikes intruded in a local nextensional tectonic setting in continental arc, caused by the Indian plate northeastern subduction to the South China Block.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The recent mineral exploration programme (2009\u20132014) in the Jiaodong gold province identified the new Guocheng-Liaoshang gold metallogenic belt which contains reserves of 92\u00a0tonnes (t) Au. In the main deposits the ore is fault-hosted in massive sulfides that make up to 25 to 95\u00a0vol%. The He-Ar isotope compositions of ore-forming fluids from 20 pyrite samples from the five main deposits are reported here.  3 He/ 4 He range between 0.41 and 2.39 R a ,  40 Ar/ 36 Ar are 367 to 2112 and  40 Ar \u204e / 4 He are 0.40\u20133.78. The data require four gas sources; a dominant mantle-derived component plus sub-ordinate crustal radiogenic, meteoric and basin brine components. The mantle end-member has  3 He/ 4 He (3.32\u20134.00 R a ). This is lower than most estimates for sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM: 6\u20137 R a ), implying that it was probably refertilized by subduction-related fluid metasomatism. This is consistent with He-Ar isotopes reported for SCLM xenoliths from basalts in the Shandong Province. Within the mineralisation province, the mine Au reserve is positively correlated with the proportion of mantle-derived He in the ore-forming fluids. This implies that the fluids, and by inference the gold, was largely derived from mantle melts during lithospheric extension. Given the conspicuous association of gold ore deposits with mantle-derived magma in the Jiaodong Peninsula, we envisage that our genetic model can be applied, to some extent, to evaluate the potential of some mineral exploration targets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Widespread Paleoproterozoic S-type granites and khondalites (high-grade sillimanite-garnet gneisses) are exposed in the Khondalite Belt of the North China Craton (NCC). Porphyritic biotite granites in the Helanshan region from the western Khondalite Belt exhibit a gradual contact relationship with the neighboring khondalites. In order to constrain the petrogenesis of these granites and their genetic relationship with the khondalites, detailed geochronological data, as well as geochemical and whole-rock Sm-Nd and zircon Lu-Hf isotope compositions of these granites are reported. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating on magmatic zircon cores yields an emplacement age of 1902\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022\u00a0Ma, whereas metamorphic rims define a metamorphic age of 1356\u00a0\u00b1\u00a057\u00a0Ma. The unpolished surfaces of zircon crystals selected based on the presence of rims visible in cathodoluminescence were further analyzed by SIMS depth profiling, which gave a more precise metamorphic age of 1317\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0Ma. The Helanshan granites display typical S-type geochemical characteristics, e.g., high A/CNK (1.16\u20131.29) and K 2 O (5.09\u20135.86\u00a0wt%) contents, but low FeO t /MgO (2.39\u20134.88) and P 2 O 5  (0.15\u20130.23\u00a0wt%) contents. Similar trace and rare earth element patterns, and consistent zircon Hf model ages (2366\u20132483\u00a0Ma) and whole rock Nd model ages (2407\u20132499\u00a0Ma) between the porphyritic biotite granites and the khondalites, suggest that they were derived from partial melting of khondalites. The geochemical character of the porphyritic biotite granites, including significant negative Eu anomalies, high Rb/Ba and Rb/Sr ratios, and variable HREE contents and (La/Yb) N  ratios, suggest that they are probably related to the post-peak decompression stage that was characterized by biotite breakdown and the progressive replacement of garnet with the presence of K-feldspar and plagioclase in the residues. Homogeneous zircon  e  Hf (t) values (mostly from \u22120.5 to +1.7), combined with low bulk-rock Fe 2 O 3  T  content and CaO/Na 2 O ratios, preclude the contribution from mafic magma. Following the continental collision, the emplacement of the porphyritic biotite granites at ca.1.90\u00a0Ga provides the latest limit on the timing of post-peak decompression metamorphism of the khondalites, and their formation supports a post-collisional mantle upwelling model to account for the 1.92\u20131.90\u00a0Ga regional metamorphic/magmatic events. On the other hand, the metamorphic zircon rims indicate that S-type granites were overprinted by a 1.32\u00a0Ga tectono-thermal event, which was probably related to the breakup of the Columbia supercontinent.",

        "abstract": "The Batang Group (BTG) volcanic rocks in the Zhiduo area, with NW-trending outcrops along the northeastern margin of the Qiangtang terrane (northern Tibet), are mainly composed of volcaniclastic rocks, dacite and rhyolite. Major and trace element, Sr and Nd isotope, zircon U\u2013Pb and Hf isotope data are presented for the BTG dacites. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry zircon U\u2013Pb dating constrains the timing of volcanic eruption as Late Triassic (221\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma). Major and trace element geochemistry shows that the BTG volcanic rocks are classified as calc-alkaline series. All samples are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements with negative\u2013slightly positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*\u00a0=\u00a00.47\u20131.15), and depleted in high field strength elements and heavy rare earth elements. In addition, these rocks possess less radiogenic Sr [(Sr/Sr)\u00a0=\u00a00.7047\u20130.7078], much radiogenic Nd (\u03b5()\u00a0=\u00a0\u22124.2 to \u22121.3) and Hf (\u03b5()\u00a0=\u00a04.0\u20136.6) isotopes, suggesting that they probably originated from partial melting of a crustal source containing a mantle-derived juvenile component. The inferred magma was assimilated by crustal materials during ascending and experienced significant fractional crystallization. By combining previously published and the new data, we propose that the BTG volcanic rocks were genetically related to southwestward subduction of the Ganzi\u2013Litang ocean (a branch of Paleo-Tethys) in the northeastern margin of the Qiangtang terrane. Given the coeval arc-affinity magmatic rocks in the region, we envisage that the Ganzi\u2013Litang ocean may extend from the Zhongdian arc through the Yidun terrane to the Zhiduo area, probably even further northwest to the Tuotuohe area.",

        "title": "Magma mixing in the Kalaqin core complex, northern North China Craton: Linking deep lithospheric destruction and shallow extension",
        "abstract": "Abstract   The widespread Mesozoic magmatism in the North China Craton (NCC) has received considerable attention as a trigger for large scale lithospheric destruction. Here we investigate the Early Cretaceous Jiguanzi adamellite from the northern part of the NCC which is contemporaneous with shallow extensional deformation and deep lithospheric destruction. This intrusion emplaced at ca. 133\u00a0Ma is located in the foot wall of the Kalaqin metamorphic core complex (MCC), and occurs as a synextensional ring complex with numerous magmatic equigranular (Group 1) and porphyritic (Group 2) enclaves. Hornblende and plagioclase from the host adamellite and xenocrysts of Group 2 enclaves show distinct inverse zoning with Mg- and Ca-rich mantle. The Group 2 enclaves are characterized by plagioclase xenocrysts hosting hornblende, biotite and apatite inclusions, quartz ocelli with fine-grained rim enriched in biotite and hornblende, and poikilitic biotite surrounded by hornblende. Geochemically, the host intrusion is calc-alkaline to alkaline and metaluminous with variable contents of SiO 2  (60.70\u201372.20\u00a0wt.%), Al 2 O 3  (14.19\u201317.22\u00a0wt.%), Na 2 O\u00a0+\u00a0K 2 O (6.16\u20139.42\u00a0wt.%), and Mg# values (28.0\u201347.7), whereas the Group 2 enclaves exhibit low SiO 2  (54.05\u201355.55\u00a0wt.%), high Fe 2 O 3  (8.18\u20138.64\u00a0wt.%) and TiO 2  (2.08\u20132.28\u00a0wt.%), and moderate Mg# (44.0\u201344.1). Both the host intrusion and Group 2 enclaves are enriched in large-ion lithophile and light rare earth elements, and depleted in high field strength elements and heavy rare earth elements except that the latter has lower Ba and high Nb, Ta and Ti contents. The major and trace element contents of the Group 1 enclaves are broadly similar to those of the host intrusion. Analyses of Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Hf isotopes in the host intrusion, and in Group 1 and Group 2 enclaves show ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i  host \u00a0=\u00a00.70600\u20130.70618,  e  Nd ( t ) host \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a08.2 to \u2212\u00a09.6, T 2DM (Nd) host \u00a0=\u00a01592\u20131706\u00a0Ma,  e  Hf ( t ) host \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a09.2 to \u2212\u00a012.0, ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i  Group 1 \u00a0=\u00a00.70590\u20130.70635,  e  Nd ( t ) Group 1 \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a09.6 to \u2212\u00a010.4, T 2DM (Nd) Group 1 \u00a0=\u00a01705\u20131775\u00a0Ma, ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i  Group 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.70586\u20130.70587,  e  Nd ( t ) Group 2 \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.6 to \u2212\u00a00.7, T 2DM (Nd) Group 2 \u00a0=\u00a0971\u2013978\u00a0Ma, and  e  Hf ( t ) Group 2 \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a04.5 to \u2212\u00a010.0. The mineralogical and geochemical features suggest that the host Jiguanzi adamellite and Group 2 enclaves were generated through synchronous mixing and fractional crystallization accompanied by mechanical and chemical exchanges. The Group 1 enclaves showing cogenetic affinity with their felsic host represent the mechanical concentrations of mafic minerals and accessory phases from evolved hybrid host magma. Magma sources of the host Jiguanzi adamellite and its Group 1 enclaves are dominated by lower crust (LCC) components, whereas those for the Group 2 enclaves are dominated by metasomatized lithospheric mantle. The magma genesis involved complex multi-stage crust\u2013mantle interaction processes including: (1) lithospheric mantle modification induced by Triassic subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean slab and/or Triassic\u2013Cretaceous asthenospheric melt underplating; and (2) melting of the ancient LCC and lithospheric mantle, and hybridization of mantle- and crust-derived melts. In conjunction with regional geological and geochemical data, we argue that the Late Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous shallow extension events represented by the Kalaqin MCC triggered deep-seated multi-stage magmatism and lithospheric destruction, and the continuous generation of magma further strengthened the extension and result in more extensive lithospheric thinning.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Bangxi-Chenxing suture zone is an important region to address the history of closure of the eastern Paleo-Tethys ocean. Among the widespread S-type granite batholiths in the SE Guangxi Province adjacent to this suture is the Nali granodiorite. Here we report zircon U\u2013Pb ages, major and trace element geochemistry, and Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Hf isotope geochemistry of a newly found Middle Permian S-type granite in this region. LA-ICP-MS zircon U\u2013Pb geochronology yields emplacement ages of 265\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 to 262\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the Nali granodiorite. Both the inner and outer phases are characterized by variable SiO 2  (66.91\u201371.39\u00a0wt.%), high Al 2 O 3  (12.99\u201314.04\u00a0wt.%), K 2 O\u00a0+\u00a0Na 2 O (4.78\u20135.98\u00a0wt.%), and A/CNK values (1.11\u20131.50), resembling those of typical S-type granites. The rocks are enriched in Rb, Th, U and light rare earth elements with weak negative Eu anomalies, and show depletion in Nb, Ta, Ti, with typical arc-like affinity. They have relatively high ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i  ratios of 0.7228 to 0.7331, low e Nd (t) values of \u2212\u00a013.6 to \u2212\u00a011.9, and low zircon e Hf (t) values (\u2212\u00a021.9 to \u2212\u00a08.8). High whole-rock Nd isotopic model ages (2.00\u20132.02\u00a0Ga) and zircon Hf isotopic model ages (1.59\u20132.20\u00a0Ga), indicate that they might have been generated by partial melting of ancient lower crust with minor contribution from mantle sources. The granodiorite shows continental arc affinity and likely formed within a subduction setting. By combining previously extant data for Permo-Triassic arc-/collision-related magmatism in the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan-Song Ma and Bangxi-Chenxing suture zones, we propose that the subduction of the eastern Paleo-Tethys might have started during Middle Permian triggered by the northward subduction of the Indochina Block (ICB) beneath the South China Block (SCB) and closure during Middle Triassic.",

        "abstract": "Orogenic belts have been among the most important locations to investigate the growth of continental crust (CC). The Eastern Kunlun Orogenic Belt (EKOB), which contains widespread Permian\u2013Triassic granitoids, is volumetrically comparable to the Cenozoic Gangdese magmatic belt in the Tibetan Plateau and is an ideal region to investigate the mechanism of the Paleozoic\u2013Mesozoic CC growth in this region. The Gouli batholith at the eastern end of the EKOB consists of the synchronous Xiangride granodiorite, Asiha quartz diorite (ca. 242 Ma) and adamellite. The granodiorite and quartz diorite, both of which contain magmatic enclaves, show medium\u2013high K, calc-alkalic and metaluminous signatures and have similar rare earth element and trace element patterns to those of bulk CC. Besides, the Xiangride granodiorite displays distinct adakitic signatures (average Sr/Y of 47). The Sr-Nd isotopic values for the different types of rocks are roughly similar ((87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.708167\u20130.713553, eNd(t) = \u2212 6.8 to \u2212 5.3), while Hf isotopes are distinguishable, with eHf(t)granodiorite = 0.3 to 5.1 and eHf(t)diorite = \u2212 1.6 to 0.7. These geochemical and petrographic signatures suggest that the granodiorite originated from the partial melting of subducting oceanic crust and terrigenous sediments, and the quartz diorite and enclaves formed via the mixing of slab-derived magma and enriched mantle-derived melt. Further comprehensive analyses of the spatial and temporal distribution of regional magmatic rocks, metamorphism and sedimentary facies reveal that the Gouli batholith and most of the Permian\u2013Triassic granitoids in the EKOB formed during the subduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean instead of subsequent syn-collision setting. Thus, we contend that the Permian\u2013Triassic CC growth of the EKOB occurred in a slab subduction setting and that both oceanic slab and subcontinental mantle significantly contributed to this process.",

In vitro, the inhibiting rate of 10.0mg/ml CP on radical-induced MDA formation in rat liver mitochondria was 39.63%, while 22.83% in normal rats liver, 45.59% incubated with Fe2+ and 67.53% incubated with H2O2. CP made the radical-induced swelling of rats liver mitochondria obviously be lower than the control, so the results showed that CP could inhibit oxidation damage of rats liver mitochondria. Cp could also inhibit hemolysis induced by H2O2 during warm-bathing of rats red blood cell, so this result showed activity the protection held against oxidation damage of rats red blood cell.",

        "abstract": "Maize sheath blight is one of the most harmful diseases in maize production in China. Because it was diff icult for identifi cation by artifi cial inoculation, the selection was ineff icient in maize breeding for resistance to sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani). 13 inbred lines derived from (CML270\u00d7478)\u00d7CML270 BCF6:7 were selected for validating the resistant to maize sheath blight by marker-assisted selection (MAS). The results showed that three inbred lines have the same banding pattern compared to the germplam of 478 identif ied by the two tight markers phi116 and umc1044 respectively. The other 10 inbred lines had the same banding pattern as the germ- pasm of CML270. This result was consistent with that evaluated by the artif icial inoculation method. The correla- tive coeff icient between them was evidence to show its greatly signif icant existence according to order statistic test (r=0.6625>r0.01=0.64), accordingly we got three inbred lines, 478C4-2-2, 478C4-2-3, 478C4-2-4, with high resistant to maize sheath blight . One of the identif ied inbred line, 478C4-2-2, would be very good germplasm for making maize hybrid , which comf irmed by the yield combining ability. The maize combination of Yudan 24, derived from 478C4-2-2 line, had been approved by Committee of Crop Cultivar Identif ication of Chongqing City in 2006 which indicated that maize inbred lines with high resistance to sheath blight could be validated effectively by molecular markers. In this paper we have strong suggestions that it should speed up the maize breeding program for develop-ing resistant varieties or hybrids by using the markers tightly linked to maize sheath blight.",

For natural latored soil, the increasing bulk density and the decreasing large pore content were more obvious, but for cultivated one, the lowering structural stability and sandification of surface layer were more serious. It is also indicated that the decrease of soil organic matter content caused by vegetation deterioration was the main interior factor causing the structural degradation of latored soils.",

Methods The subjects consisted of 10 males and 10 females. Jiggling force was applied to the treated teeth before treated premolars were extracted. Control premolars were extracted without any force. The specimens were decalcificated and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and modified Mallory\u2032s trichrome. The area of periodontium and area of cementum were calculated by computerized analysis. The data were analyzed statistically. Results 73 s was average time of extraction of treated teeth, 148 s was average of control teeth. And there was significant difference on the first premolars of both mandible and maxilla(P<0.01). Quantitative analysis of quantity of periodontium on root showed jiggling force can leave more periodontium attached to the root surface on extracted human first premolars. Conclusion Jiggling force can reduce the time of extraction,so it can decrease the damage to periodontium. Pre-extraction jiggling force can leave more periodontium attached to the root surface on autotransplantation teeth.",

The specific analyses and optimizations of other components or the whole Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler (SPTC) with the ECA model have not been carried out. In this paper, a new ECA model including the main components of the SPTC such as regenerator, pulse tube, phase shifter and reservoir has been developed. To improve the practicability of the ECA model, based on the basic governing equations, calculation expressions of the above components are worked out, and their equivalent analogical electrical elements are defined according to the analogy theory. Through the developed ECA model, the specific pressure and volume flow rate at any position can be acquired. Further optimizations on the SPTC based on the ECA model show that, with the same pressure and PV power at the warm end of the regenerator, there exists an optimal phase angle between the pressure and the volume flow rate for the SPTC to achieve the highest gross cooling capacity. In addition, with the same ratio of the pressure to the volume flow rate and the same phase angle between them at the warm end of the regenerator, when the regenerator ineffectiveness loss is neglected, the SPTC efficiency keeps constant with variations of the PV power, however, the efficiency will increase with the increase of the PV power if the loss is considered.",

In this paper, the interaction of them has been analyzed in a detailed way to reveal the match mechanism, and systematic investigations on the two-way matching have been conducted. The design method of the PTCF to achieve the optimal matching for the given compressor and the counterpart design method of the compressor to achieve the optimal matching for the given PTCF are put forward. Specific experiments are then carried out to verify the conducted theoretical analyses and modeling. For a given linear compressor, a new in-line PTCF which seeks to achieve the optimal match is simulated, designed and tested. And for a given coaxial PTCF, a new dual-opposed moving-coil linear compressor is also developed to match with it. The simulated and experimental results are compared, and fairly good agreements are found between them in both cases. The matched in-line cooler with the newly-designed PTCF has capacities of 4\u201311.84\u00a0W at 80\u00a0K with higher than 17% of Carnot efficiency and the mean motor efficiency of 81.5%, and the matched coaxial cooler with the new-designed compressor can provide 2\u20135.5\u00a0W at 60\u00a0K with higher than 9.6% of Carnot efficiency and the mean motor efficiency of 83%, which verify the validity of the theoretical investigations on the optimal match and the proposed design methods.",

The results indicate that the dynamic pressure at the inlet of the cold finger has a weak relation with the driving voltage waveform, but the latter plays an important role in affecting both the motor efficiency and the SPTC cooling performance. In the tested range, either the cooling efficiency or the motor efficiency under the smeared sine waveform is the highest, while that under the sine waveform is the lowest. Moreover, given that the input power is below 30\u2009W, the motor efficiencies under both smeared sine and trapezoid waveforms exceed 90%, which suggests a promising approach to achieve a linear compressor with a very high motor efficiency by optimizing the voltage waveform.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The two-stage Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler (SPTC) has advantages in simultaneously providing the cooling powers at two different temperatures, and the capacity in distributing these cooling capacities between the stages is significant to its practical applications. In this paper, a theoretical model of the thermally-coupled two-stage SPTC without external precooling is established based on the electric circuit analogy with considering real gas effects, and the simulations of both the cooling performances and PV power distribution between stages are conducted. The results indicate that the PV power is inversely proportional to the acoustic impedance of each stage, and the cooling capacity distribution is determined by the cold finger cooling efficiency and the PV power into each stage together. The design methods of the cold fingers to achieve both the desired PV power and the cooling capacity distribution between the stages are summarized. The two-stage SPTC is developed and tested based on the above theoretical investigations, and the experimental results show that it can simultaneously achieve 0.69\u00a0W at 30\u00a0K and 3.1\u00a0W at 85\u00a0K with an electric input power of 330\u00a0W and a reject temperature of 300\u00a0K.

        "abstract": "Abstract   A two-dimensional regenerator model based on Brinkman-Forchheimer equations is established to obtain a model with fast speed and acceptable accuracy. To improve the performance of the Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler (SPTC), the different filling proportions of mixed matrices made of stainless steel (SS) screens are simulated and compared, and then the optimal proportion is suggested. The analyses are mainly focused on the cooling performance and the losses caused by the different entropy generations. The experiments are then conducted to verify the theoretical investigations based on a single-stage coaxial SPTC, in which the cooling characteristics with various frequencies and temperatures are tested and then compared with the analyses. The results show a good agreement between the simulations and the experiments. The cooling performance can be enhanced based on the optimized mixed matrix, in which for a reject temperature of 300\u00a0K and an input electric power of 220\u00a0W, the SPTC has experimentally achieved the cooling capacity of 0.45\u00a0W at 30\u00a0K and a no-load temperature of 26.7\u00a0K. The performance is impressive considering that only the conventional SS matrices are employed and neither double-inlet nor multi-bypass phase-shifting approach is used.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Theoretical analyses and experimental verification for a three-stage Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler (SPTC) expected to operate at 5\u201312\u202fK are conducted. Cryogenic phase-shifting and mixed regenerator matrices are employed to improve the performance at the third stage. Simulations of the phase relationship, dynamic pressure and mass flow rate are presented with third-stage phase-shifters at 40\u202fK, 50\u202fK and 293\u202fK, respectively. Mixed regenerator matrices of conventional stainless steel meshes and rare-earth materials such as Er 3 Ni, HoCu 2  and Er 0.6 Pr 0.4  are optimized theoretically. Different ratios and combinations are analyzed and compared, and the quantitative analyses by the entropy analysis are made. A three-stage SPTC without external precooling is developed based on the theoretical analyses, and experiments were conducted. The results show a good agreement between simulations and experiments. With an overall input electric power of 370\u202fW, the three-stage SPTC has experimentally reached a no-load temperature of 6.82\u202fK and achieved a cooling capacity of 112\u202fmW at 10\u202fK.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper presents the CFD modeling and experimental verifications of oscillating flow and heat transfer processes in the micro coaxial Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler (MCSPTC) operating at 90\u2013170\u202fHz. It uses neither double-inlet nor multi-bypass while the inertance tube with a gas reservoir becomes the only phase-shifter. The effects of the frequency on flow and heat transfer processes in the pulse tube are investigated, which indicates that a low enough frequency would lead to a strong mixing between warm and cold fluids, thereby significantly deteriorating the cooling performance, whereas a high enough frequency would produce the downward sloping streams flowing from the warm end to the axis and almost puncturing the gas displacer from the warm end, thereby creating larger temperature gradients in radial directions and thus undermining the cooling performance. The influence of the pulse tube length on the temperature and velocity when the frequencies are much higher than the optimal one are also discussed. A MCSPTC with an overall mass of 1.1\u202fkg is worked out and tested. With an input electric power of 59\u202fW and operating at 144\u202fHz, it achieves a no-load temperature of 61.4\u202fK and a cooling capacity of 1.0\u202fW at 77\u202fK. The changing tendencies of tested results are in good agreement with the simulations. The above studies will help to thoroughly understand the underlying mechanism of the inertance MCSPTC operating at very high frequencies.",

The output power of the OFC is very stable, with the specially designed circuit and the flatness of the frequency comb over the span of 6 nm, which can be limited to 1.5 dB. Four channel wavelengths are chosen to demonstrate one-to-many channels for FSO communication, like optical wireless broadcast. The outdoor experiment is established to test the bit error rate (BER) and eye diagrams with 12.5 Gb/s on-off keying (OOK). The indoor experiment is used to test the highest traffic rate, which is up to 21 Gb/s for one-hop FSO communication. To the best of our knowledge, this scheme is the first to propose the realization of one-to-many broadcasting transmission for FSO communication based on the OFC module. The advantages of integration, miniaturization, channelization, low power consumption, and unlimited bandwidth of one-to-many broadcasting communication scheme, shows promising results on constructing the future space-air-ground-ocean (SAGO) FSO communication networks.",

The output power of the OFC is very stable, with the specially designed circuit and the flatness of the frequency comb over the span of 6 nm, which can be limited to 1.5 dB. Four channel wavelengths are chosen to demonstrate one-to-many channels for FSO communication, like optical wireless broadcast. The outdoor experiment is established to test the bit error rate (BER) and eye diagrams with 12.5 Gb/s on-off keying (OOK). The indoor experiment is used to test the highest traffic rate, which is up to 21 Gb/s for one-hop FSO communication. To the best of our knowledge, this scheme is the first to propose the realization of one-to-many broadcasting transmission for FSO communication based on the OFC module. The advantages of integration, miniaturization, channelization, low power consumption, and unlimited bandwidth of one-to-many broadcasting communication scheme, shows promising results on constructing the future space-air-ground-ocean (SAGO) FSO communication networks.",

Pulse amplitude modulation-4 (PAM-4) modulation format is adopted in our scheme to further improve system capacity. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our scheme, the outdoor experiments with 25 Gb/s PAM-4 are tested in free space. With 8 \u00d7 25 Gb/s ~50-m outdoor transmission between the two buildings, the eye diagrams and bit error rates (BERs) are tested for one-hop system and forwarding system, respectively. For one-hop system, clear eye diagrams and stable BER performance are demonstrated in all the wavelengths. For the forwarding system, the values of BER with eight channels are measured lasting for 30 min that range from 1E-2 to 1E-3. The experimental results show that the scheme is feasible in FSO transmission system for 5G wireless networks. The advantages of integration, channelization, miniaturization, and low power consumption of the FSO WDM scheme present a promising result on constructing the future fronthaul/backhaul link for wireless cellular networks and optical access network extension.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that high-fat diet (HFD) is a predisposing factor for metabolic syndrome-associated systemic inflammation and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1/receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (TNF-\u03b1/RIPK3) axis has recently become regarded as an important regulator and contributor in many inflammation-related diseases. Fisetin (Fn) is a bioactive flavonoid polyphenol with anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity. Lately it has gained increasing attention due to its potential advantages in prevention of tumors, metabolic disorders, neuroinflammation and chronic liver injury. However, its role in NAFLD is still not fully understood. Thus, we studied whether prolonged HFD causes TNF-\u03b1/RIPK3 activation-associated hepatic steatosis, further evaluating the protective effects of Fn in HFD-fed mice. As expected, HFD promotes metabolic syndrome and pro-inflammatory cytokine generation in serum, enhances liver inflammatory infiltration-related lipid accumulation by increase of TNF-\u03b1/RIPK3 activation, ultimately resulting in development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In contrast to this, dietary Fn intervention could suppress metabolic disorder and HFD-triggered hepatic function loss, downregulate TNF-\u03b1/RIPK3 signaling-associated hepatic inflammation, balance lipid metabolism-related gene expression, and finally inhibit lipid accumulation and steatohepatitis. Hence, Fn restrains HFD-induced hepatic inflammation and lipid deposition by downregulating metabolic disorder and excessive liver inflammation-associated TNF-\u03b1/RIPK3 axis activation.",

        "abstract": "Obesity-related renal disease is related to caloric excess promoting deleterious cellular responses. However, a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in progressive kidney disease, as well as a therapeutic strategy, is still absent. Fisetin (FIS), as a natural flavonoid, possesses various bioactivities in a number of disease models. However, its role in obesity-associated kidney injury is still unclear and requires elucidation. In our study, an obesity animal model was established using C57BL/6 mice fed with a normal chow diet (NCD) or high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks with or without FIS administration (20, 40 or 80 mg kg-1). Our results indicated that chronic HFD feeding led to a significant body weight gain in mice compared to the normal control group, accompanied by a marked insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, whereas FIS treatment exerted prominently protective effects. In addition, FIS significantly attenuated HFD-induced histological alterations in renal tissue samples. Moreover, FIS treatment down-regulated expression of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and up-regulated nephrin and podocin expression levels in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice, improving their renal dysfunction. After HFD feeding, mice treated with FIS exhibited a decrease in phosphorylated IRS1Ser307, and an increase in phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 1 (IRS1Tyr608), AKT, forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2. Furthermore, FIS administration markedly restrained the inflammatory response in the kidneys of HFD-challenged mice, as evidenced by the reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, which was attributed to the blockage of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling. Importantly, FIS-treated obese mice exerted a remarkable decrease in RIP3 expressions in the kidneys compared to obese mice in the absence of FIS, along with an evident reduction in the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), an apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a Caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and Caspase-1. The protective effects of FIS against HFD-induced renal injury were verified in vitro using palmitate (PAL)-treated HK2 cells, an immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cell line from the adult human kidney. In summary, our results supported the notion that FIS functions as a promising agent to improve insulin resistance and inflammatory response against metabolic stress-induced renal injury.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of intervening type II diabetes by flavonoid compound from Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb in vitro. We found flavonoid compound exhibited moderate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist activity which was lower than that of rosiglitazone by luciferase reporter assay. 3T3-L1 cell differentiation was induced typically in the presence of various concentrations of flavonoid compound or pioglitazone for assaying insulin sensitization. We found that flavonoid compound effectively promoted 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation and lipid deposition, but its intensity was lower than that of pioglitazone. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays showed that flavonoid compound promoted the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT enhancer binding protein-\u03b1, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 in a dose-dependent manner. As a result, the expressions of Glut4 and adiponectin were significantly enhanced. Additionally, the expressions of AP2 and lipoprotein lipase induced by flavonoid compound were lower than those by pioglitazone. These findings indicate that flavonoid compound from Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb exhibits the good property of partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonism, and shares similar insulin-sensitizing effects with pioglitazone, but has lower adipogenic capacity. It is implied that flavonoid compound has a promising prospect of fighting insulin resistance as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.",

        "abstract": "The microenvironment around an immobilized enzyme molecule significantly influences the properties of the immobilized enzyme. To explore the combined effects of macromolecular crowding and surface charge on the properties of an immobilized enzyme, epoxy resin was modified by different quality percentage concentrations of chitosan to obtain different crowding and charge conditions of the microenvironment. With this system, the catalytic features of immobilized 7\u03b1- and 7\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7\u03b1-, 7\u03b2-HSDH) were investigated. The results indicate that the activities and thermal stabilities of immobilized 7\u03b1-HSDH and 7\u03b2-HSDH can be improved by manipulating the crowding and surface charge effects. The relative activity of immobilized 7\u03b1-HSDH and 7\u03b2-HSDH on EP-0.5-C increased approximately 90% and 50% relative to the immobilization onto EP. The immobilization of 7\u03b1-HSDH and 7\u03b2-HSDH onto EP-0.5-C preserved a higher activity (approximately 73% and 88% of the initial activity) than that preserved by immobilization onto EP (approximately 29% and 40% of the initial activity) after incubation at 45 \u00b0C for 2 h. In addition, the catalytic efficiency and reusability of co-immobilized 7\u03b1-HSDH and 7\u03b2-HSDH was improved. The TCDCA conversion of the co-immobilized enzymes onto EP-0.5-C was increased approximately 45%, compared to the conversion of the co-immobilized enzymes onto EP. The TCDCA conversion of the co-immobilized enzymes on EP-0.5-C remained at 83.72 \u00b1 0.66% after seven successive cycles. These findings suggest that crowding and charge of the microenvironment can significantly improve the properties of the immobilized enzyme.",

Thus, immobilized multienzymatic systems that exploit the chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity of biocatalysts have been developed. Recently, a variety of bioinspired immobilized multienzymatic systems was fabricated. In this review, immobilized multienzymatic systems were divided into three types: stepwise immobilized enzymes, mixed immobilized enzymes, or co-immobilized enzymes. General considerations such as coupling pH, coupling temperature, proportion of each enzyme, and cascade bottleneck analysis for the enzymatic cascade reaction were presented. For greater insight, we analyzed the effects of substrate channeling, mass transport limitation, synergistic mechanisms, and promotion of cofactor regeneration on immobilized multienzymatic systems. Some recent novel examples of immobilized multienzymatic systems were summarized. The aim of this review is to promote and broaden the application of immobilized multienzymatic systems in biocatalysis and other related fields.",

        "abstract": "To clarify the substantial basis of the excellent antioxidant capacity of  Ledeb. Fourteen flavonoids were isolated and identified from  Ledeb, seven of which have notable DPPH radical scavenging activities, i.e., catechin, luteolin, quercetin, quercitrin, hyperoside, rutin, luteolin-7--\u03b2-glucoside with IC values of 5.06, 7.29, 4.36, 7.12, 6.34, 6.36 and 8.12 \u00b5M, respectively. The DNA nicking assay showed that five flavonoids from  Ledeb-taxifolin, catechin, hyperoside, quercitrin and rutin-have good protective activity against DNA oxidative damage. Further, we analyzed the bioactivity-structure relationship of these 14 flavonoids by applying quantum theory. According to their O-H bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE), C ring's spin density and stable molecular structure, the relationship between their structures and radical scavenging capacities was evaluated and clarified. We found that among flavonoid aglycones from  Ledeb, the O-H BDE of quercetin is lowest with the values of 69.02 and the O-H BDE of apigenin is highest with the values of 79.77. It is interesting that the O-H BDE value of isovitexin (78.55) with glycoside at C-6 position is lower than that of its aglycone (79.77) and vitexin (99.20) with glycoside at C-8 position. Further analysis indicated that the glycosidation of flavonoids at C-6 in the A-ring makes a more uniform distribution of spin density and improves the stability of free radicals leading to the increase in antioxidant capacity. Flavonoids with good antioxidant capacity might contribute to the pharmacological effects of  Ledeb.",

To date, information on microbial diversity in the gut of the Asiatic black bears from different populations remains limited. To determine the species composition and community structure of the gut microbiota in the Asiatic black bear, we characterized 36 fecal samples from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Heilongjiang provinces, China, by pyrosequencing the 16S V3-V4 hypervariable regions using the Illumina Miseq platform. Results showed that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla in the samples, which were largely comprised Escherichia-Shigella, Peptostreptococcaceae_incertae_sedis, Turicibacter, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. By analyzing the community structure from these 36 samples, we found that there were significant differences in the species diversity and richness between Sichuan, Yunnan, and Heilongjiang populations. In conclusion, our results reveal the species composition and structure of the gut microbiota in captive black bears in China, and suggest that biogeography could affect the black bear' gut microbiota.",

        "abstract": "Chronic inflammation of adipose tissues contributes to obesity-triggered insulin resistance. Unfortunately, the potential molecular mechanisms regarding obesity associated systemic inflammation and metabolic disorder remain complicated. Here we display that inactive rhomboid-like protein 2 (iRhom2) is increased in mice fat with adipose inflammation. After 16 weeks on a high fat diet (HFD), obesity, chronic inflammation in adipose tissues and insulin resistance are markedly mitigated in iRhom2-knockout (iRhom2 KO) mice, but exaggerated in iRhom2-overactivated mice. The adverse impressions of iRhom2 on adipose inflammation and associated pathologies are determined in db/db mice. Also, we further exhibit that in response to HFD, iRhom2 KO mice and mice with deletion only in myeloid cells showed less severe adipose inflammation and insulin resistance than the control groups. Conversely, transplantation of bone marrow cells from normal mice to iRhom2 KO mice unleashed the severity of systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction after HFD ingestion. In conclusion, we identify iRhom2 as a key regulator that promotes obesity-associated metabolic disorder. Loss of iRhom2 from macrophages in adipose tissues inhibited the inflammation and insulin resistance. iRhom2 might be a therapeutic target for obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "The DNA binding and cleavage properties of quercetin nickel (II) complex have been studied, but little attention has been devoted to the relationship between antitumor activity of this complex and DNA-binding properties. In the present study, we report that quercetin nickel (II) complex showed significant cytotoxicity against three tumor cell lines (HepG2, SMMC7721 and A549). Hoechst33258 and AO/EB staining showed HepG2 cells underwent the typical morphologic changes of apoptosis characterized by nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation, or fragmentation after exposure to quercetin nickel (II) complex. We also demonstrate that the levels of survivin and bcl-2 protein expression in HepG2 cells decreased concurrently, and the levels of p53 protein increased significantly after treatment with quercetin nickel (II) complex by immunocytochemistry analysis. The relative activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 increased significantly after treatment with the complex. Furthermore, fluorescence measurements and molecular modeling were performed to learn that the complex could be preferentially bound to DNA in GC region. These results imply that quercetin nickel (II) complex may intercalate into the GC-rich core promoter region of survivin, down-regulating survivin gene expression and promoting tumor cells apoptosis. So our results suggest that antitumor activity of quercetin nickel (II) complex might be related to its intercalation into DNA and DNA-binding selectivity, and that the complex may be a promising agent for cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "The mortality rate of acute liver failure significantly increases due to fatal septicemia. Inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2) is an essential regulator of shedding TNF-\u03b1 by trafficking with TNF-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE). Fisetin, a flavonoid present in various fruits and plants, possesses anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, multi-combination nanoparticles Fe@Au conjugated with fisetin, iRhom2 small interfering RNA (siRNA), and TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor (FN) are prepared to examine their effects on fatal septicemia-associated hepatic failure induced by Listeria monocytogenes (LM) in mice and to reveal the underlying mechanisms. After LM infection, upregulation of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminease, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, TNF-\u03b1, malondialdehyde, H O , and O is observedcompared to FN-treated mice. The iRhom2/TACE/TNF-\u03b1 signals are enhanced in vivo and in vitro, resulting in oxidative stress, which is especially associated with the activation of kupffer cells and other macrophages. Decrease in Nrf2 activation and increase of inflammation-associated regulators are also noted in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of TNF-\u03b1 derived from macrophages aggravates hepatic failure. Inversely, the processes above are restored by FN nanoparticles through the regulation of the iRhom2/TACE/TNF-\u03b1 axis and Nrf2 activation. These findings suggest that FN may be a potential approach to protect against bacterial septicemia-related diseases by targeting iRhom2.",

        "abstract": "Research suggests that particulate matter (PM) is a predisposing factor for metabolic syndrome-related systemic inflammation and oxidative stress injury. TNF-\u03b1 as a major pro-inflammatory cytokine was confirmed to participate in various diseases. Inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2) was recently determined as a necessary regulator for shedding of TNF-\u03b1 in immune cells. Importantly, kidney-resident macrophages are critical to inflammation-associated chronic renal injury. Podocyte injury can be induced by stimulants and give rise to nephritis, but how iRhom2 contributes to PM-induced renal injury is unclear. Thus, we studied whether PM causes renal injury and characterized iRhom2 with respect to TNF-\u03b1 release in mice macrophages and renal tissues in long-term PM-exposed mouse models. After long-term PM exposures, renal injury was confirmed via inflammatory cytokine, chemokine expression, and reduced antioxidant activity. Patients with kidney-related diseases had increased TNF-\u03b1, which may contribute to renal injury. We observed up-regulation of serum creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, kidney injury molecule 1, uric acid, TNF-\u03b1, MDA, HO and O in PM-treated mice, which was greater than that found in Nrf2 mice. Meanwhile, increases in metabolic disorder-associated indicators were involved in PM-induced nephritis. In vitro, kidney-resident macrophages were observed to be critical to renal inflammatory infiltration and function loss via regulation of iRhom2/TACE/TNF-\u03b1 signaling, and suppression of Nrf2-associated anti-oxidant response. PM exposure led to renal injury partly by inflammation-mediated podocyte injury. Reduced SOD1, SOD2, Nrf2 activation, and increased XO, NF-\u03baB activity, TACE, iNOS, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b1, Emr-1, MCP-1, and Cxcr4, were also noted. Long-term PM exposure causes chronic renal injury by up-regulation of iRhom2/TACE/TNF-\u03b1 axis in kidney-resident macrophages. Overexpression of TNF-\u03b1 derived from macrophages causes podocyte injury and kidney function loss. Thus, PM toxicities are related to exposure duration and iRhom2 may be a potential therapeutic renal target.",

        "abstract": "An increasing number of studies have shown that air pollution containing particulate matter (PM) \u22642.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) plays a significant role in the development of metabolic disorder and other chronic diseases. Inflammation and oxidative stress caused by metabolic syndrome are widely determined to be critical factors in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. However, there is no direct evidence of this, and the underlying molecular mechanism is still not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of inflammation and oxidative stress caused by prolonged PM2.5 exposure in dyslipidemia-associated chronic hepatic injury, and further determined whether an increase in hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress promoted lipid accumulation in the liver, ultimately increasing the risk of NAFLD. Therefore, we studied changes in indicators of metabolic disorder and in symbolic indices of NAFLD. We confirmed increases in insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, peripheral inflammation and dysarteriotony in PM2.5-induced mice. Oxidative stress and inflammatory response in the liver caused by PM2.5 inhalation contributed to abnormal hepatic function, further promoting lipid accumulation in the liver. Moreover, we observed inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory response by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in vitro, suggesting that oxidative stress and inflammatory in liver cells aggravated by PM2.5 contributed to hepatic injury by altering normal lipid metabolism. These results indicate a new goal for preventing and treating air pollution-induced diseases: suppression of oxidative stress and inflammatory response.",

Recently, inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2) was considered as a necessary modulator for shedding of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in immune cells. TNF-\u03b1, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine, was linked to various pathogenesis of diseases, including dyslipidemia. Here, wild type (WT) and iRhom2-knockout (iRhom2 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice were used to investigate the effects of iRhom2 on PM2.5-induced hepatic dyslipidemia. The hepatic histology, inflammatory response, glucose tolerance, serum parameters and gene expressions were analyzed. We found that long-term inhalation of PM2.5 resulted in hepatic steatosis. And a significant up-regulation of iRhom2 in liver tissues was observed, accompanied with elevated TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE), TNF\u03b1 receptor (TNFR)2 and various inflammatory cytokines expressions. Additionally, PM2.5 treatment caused TG and TC accumulation in serum and liver, probably attributed to changes of genes modulating lipid metabolism. Intriguingly, hepatic injury and dyslipidemia were attenuated by iRhom2 \u2212/\u2212  in mice with PM2.5 challenge. In\u00a0vitro, iRhom2-knockdwon reduced TNF-\u03b1 expressions and its associated inflammatory cytokines in Kupffer cells, implying that liver-resident macrophages played an important role in regulating hepatic inflammation and lipid metabolism in cells treated with PM2.5. The findings indicated that long-term PM2.5 exposure caused hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia through triggering inflammation, which was, at least partly, dependent on iRhom2/TNF-\u03b1 pathway in liver-resident macrophages.",

        "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) has been implicated in obesity-associated cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2), also known as Rhbdf2, is an inactive member of the rhomboid intramembrane proteinase family, playing an essential role in regulating inflammation. Nevertheless, the role of ERS-meditated iRhom2 pathway in metabolic stress-induced cardiomyopathy remains unknown. In the study, we showed that 4-PBA, as an essential ERS inhibitor, significantly alleviated high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic disorder and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Additionally, lipid deposition in heart tissues was prevented by 4-PBA in HFD-challenged mice. Moreover, 4-PBA blunted the expression of iRhom2, TACE, TNFR2 and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB to prevent HFD-induced expression of inflammatory factors. Further, 4-PBA restrained HFD-triggered oxidative stress by promoting Nrf-2 signaling. Importantly, 4-PBA markedly suppressed cardiac ERS in HFD mice. The anti-inflammation, anti-ERS and anti-oxidant effects of 4-PBA were verified in palmitate (PAL)-incubated macrophages and cardiomyocytes. In addition, promoting ERS could obviously enhance iRhom2 signaling in vitro. Intriguingly, our data demonstrated that PAL-induced iRhom2 up-regulation apparently promoted macrophage to generate inflammatory factors that could promote cardiomyocyte inflammation and lipid accumulation. Finally, interventions by adding fisetin or metformin significantly abrogated metabolic stress-induced cardiomyopathy through the mechanisms mentioned above. In conclusion, this study provided a novel mechanism for metabolic stress-induced cardiomyopathy pathogenesis. Therapeutic strategy to restrain ROS/ERS/iRhom2 signaling pathway could be developed to prevent myocardial inflammation and lipid deposition, consequently alleviating obesity-induced cardiomyopathy.",

        "abstract": "A simple method for determining 33 pesticides with a wide polarity range (logK 0.6-4.5) in aquatic products was developed based on LC-MS/MS. The target analytes included three types of widely used pesticides: insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. Based on the optimization of ultrasonic assisted extraction and GPC clean-up procedures, the matrix effect, extraction recoveries and LOD were improved distinctively. LOQ of this method was below 0.5ng/g for all pesticides, which is superior to values in the literature, and the matrix effect was reduced effectively (-14.7% to 7.5%). The method was successfully applied to investigate the pesticide residue levels of twenty-five samples including seven common kinds of fishes from Northeast China. The results showed that all targeted pesticides were present in the fish samples; however, their levels were low, except for atrazine, linuron, ethoprophos, tetrachlorvinphos, acetochlor and fenthion. Atrazine and linuron caught our attention because the concentrations of atrazine in fish samples from Liaoning province were in the range of 0.5-8ng/g (w/w) with mean concentration of 2.3ng/g, which were far above those of other pesticides. The levels of linuron were in the range of 0.6-6ng/g (mean concentration 2.8ng/g), which were the highest among all targeted pesticides in the Inner Mongolia. This is the first systematic investigation on the characteristics and levels of these pesticides in aquatic products from northeast China. Considering their toxicity and bioaccumulation, the potential risk of atrazine and linuron from consuming aquatic products should be paid more attention.",

        "abstract": "The levels and spatial distribution of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in freshwater products from Northeast China were investigated by gas chromatography coupled to isotope dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry. All samples were on-spot sampled from main production regions of freshwater products in Northeast China, and these samples were used to systematically assess the potential health risks of OCPs and PCBs associated with consumption of these fishery products. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and PCBs were the major pollutants with 100% detection rates, and their levels ranged from 0.086 to 58, 0.038-3.3, 0.093-4.5 and 0.032-1.4\u202fng\u202fg wet weight, respectively. The estimated dietary intakes of these contaminants were all below their corresponding acceptable daily intakes. Significant regional differences in the levels of OCPs and PCBs (P\u202f\u2266\u202f0.001) were found in samples from Liaoning and Inner Mongolia. The results showed that the concentrations of targeted contaminants in aquatic products had species-specific characteristics, and the levels of targeted pollutants in Oncorhynchus mykiss and Eriocheir sienesis were significantly higher than those in other aquatic product species. Advisories on ten species of aquatic products suggested that consumption of Eriocheir sinensis, Oncorhynchus mykiss and Cyprinus carpio at a rate exceeding 15 meals per month would pose a cancer risk. A health risk assessment indicated that exposure to these pollutants through freshwater products consumption would cause a non-ignorable potential carcinogenic risk to humans.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the poly(divinylbenzene) (PDVB) supported synthesis of quaternized hyperbranched macromolecules (QHMs) and its use as a highly selective, high-capacity mixed-mode anion-exchange (MAX) sorbent. In detail, the aminated PDVB support was firstly synthesized by copolymerization of divinylbenzene and 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate via Pickering emulsion polymerization. The QHMs were then grafted on PDVB by a divergent synthesis involving consecutive reactions of resorcinol diglycidyl ether with methylamine (N, N-dimethylethanolamine for terminal epoxides), which brought in a high density of quaternary ammonium functionalities. The changes of specific surface area (S), pore volume and ion exchange capacity (IEC) with generation number reveal that the QHMs have been grown successfully within the large meso-channels of the porous aminated PDVB. The best compromise between the S, pore volume and IEC was obtained at the 4th generation (G4). Due to the highest IEC (0.47\u202fmeq/g), the G4-QHMs was successfully applied for mixed-mode solid phase extraction (SPE) of acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). An efficient approach based on the mixed-mode SPE coupled with HPLC-UV was developed for highly selective extraction and cleanup of nine NSAIDs (tolmetin, TLM; ketoprofen, KEP; naproxen, NAP; flurbiprofen, FLB; diclofenac, DIC; indomethacin, INM; ibuprofen, IBP; mefenamic acid, MFA; tolfenamic acid, TFA) in human urine samples. Under the optimized conditions, the method exhibited satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.9% to 104.0% with relative standard deviation (RSD) values below 8.5%, good sensitivity (0.004-0.009\u202f\u03bcg\u202fmL limit of detection) and good linearity (coefficient of determination, R >\u202f0.997, 0.01-0.2\u202f\u03bcg\u202fmL for NAP, 0.05-1.0\u202f\u03bcg\u202fmL for FLB, DIC, INM, MFA, TFA, 0.1-2.0\u202f\u03bcg\u202fmL for TLM, KEP, IBP). The hyperbranched MAX sorbent is superior to Oasis HLB and comparable to Oasis MAX in obtaining clean chromatographic profiles. Our results demonstrate the potential application of the hyperbranched MAX for complex sample analysis.",

        "abstract": "Bioaccumulation and human health risks of essential and toxic metals in ten species of freshwater products from Northeast China were investigated in this study. The concentrations (mg/kg wet weight) of target metals in aquatic products were: Fe (4.6-165.4), Zn (4.1-33.4), Mn (0.28-80.0), Cu (0.24-15.8), Cr (0.074-0.80), As (0.0068-0.72), Hg (0.016-0.58), Ni (0.019-0.58), Pb (0.017-0.27) and Cd (0.0004-0.058). There was no significant regional difference of target metal levels in fish samples between Liaoning province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region according to matched sample t-test. Every daily intakes (EDI) of target metals from freshwater products were far below their corresponding limits. However, health risk assessment of individual metal in freshwater products showed methyl mercury (MeHg) and Mn could pose potential noncarcinogenic risk to human, and inorganic arsenic (iAs) would cause potential carcinogenic risk to consumers at the level of 1 in 100,000. Furthermore, freshwater product species-specific bioaccumulation characteristics for different metals are quite different. The total hazard quotients of target metals in different aquatic product species demonstrated that co-exposure of target metals by consumption of these six species (C. auratus, E. sinensis, C. erythropterus, C. carpio, M. anguillicaudatus and O. cantor) from Northeast China could cause potential noncarcinogenic risk to human, and the pollution of toxic metals in E. sinensis and C. auratus were most serious among all investigated aquatic species.",

        "abstract": "Both leptin and osteocalcin have been found to affect growth-plate cartilage development through regulation of the physiologic processes of endochondral bone formation. Leptin mediates bone development and osteocalcin secreted in the late stage of osteoblast differentiation. The relationship between leptin and osteocalcin expression in the chondrogenic cells line is still not clear. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the effect of leptin on the expression of osteocalcin in chondrocytes. We used clonal mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 cells to investigate the relationship between leptin and osteocalcin. We found that both leptin and osteocalcin expression were dynamically expressed during ATDC5 cell differentiation from 4 to 21 days. We also found that leptin significantly upregulated osteocalcin mRNA and protein levels 24 h after leptin stimulation. However, different concentrations and exposure times of osteocalcin did not affect the levels of leptin protein. Furthermore, we confirmed that leptin augmented the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in a time-dependent manner but not p38 or AKT. Inhibition of pERK1/2 expression by a specific ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and a special small interfering RNA attenuated levels of leptin-induced osteocalcin expression, indicating that ERK1/2 mediates, in part, the effects of leptin on osteocalcin. Taken together, our results suggest that leptin regulates the expression of osteocalcin in growth plate chondrocytes via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, while there is no effect on the phosphorylation of either p38 or AKT.",

        "title": "Recovery of respiratory function and autonomic diaphragm movement following unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve to phrenic nerve anastomosis in rabbits.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Respiratory dysfunction is the leading cause of mortality following upper cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). The authors' previous study suggested that vagus nerve (VN) and phrenic nerve (PN) anastomosis could partially improve respiratory function in rabbits that had been subjected to PN transection. As a branch of the VN and a motor fiber-dominated nerve, the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) seems a better choice to anastomose with the PN for respiratory function restoration after upper cervical SCI. This study was designed to determine whether RLN-PN anastomosis could restore the respiratory function after upper cervical SCI in rabbits. METHODS Twelve male New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups: 1) sham group (no injury), 2) transection group (right RLN and PN were transected), and 3) bridge group (transected right RLN and PN were immediately anastomosed). Spontaneous discharges of the RLN and PN were compared using a bio-signal collection system. RLN and PN cross sections were stained for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and the numbers of motor fibers were compared. Three months after the initial surgical procedures, the movement of the diaphragm was assessed using a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) system, and discharges from the right diaphragm muscle were recorded. Toluidine blue staining, electron microscopy, and staining for AChE were used to assess whether motor fibers from the RLN regenerated into the PN, and sections of diaphragm were examined after AChE staining to assess the motor endplates. RESULTS Both the RLN and PN exhibited highly rhythmic discharges, synchronized with respiration, and most fibers in the RLN and PN were found to be motor fibers. Numerous myelinated fibers were observed in anastomosed PN using toluidine blue staining and electron microscopy. Staining for AChE showed that those regenerated fibers had typical characteristics of motor fibers, and motor endplates with typical morphological characteristics were observed in the diaphragm. Reestablished rhythmic contraction of the hemidiaphragm was directly observed using the DSA system, and rhythmic spontaneous discharge was recorded from the reinnervated hemidiaphragm using the bio-signal collection system. CONCLUSIONS Motor fibers from the RLN could regenerate into the PN after end-to-end anastomosis and reinnervate the denervated hemidiaphragm in rabbits. Those regenerated motor fibers restored rhythmic and autonomic movement of the paralyzed diaphragm. These results suggest that the RLN is an optimal donor nerve to anastomose with the PN in order to reestablish the autonomic movement of paralyzed diaphragms after high-level SCI.",

        "abstract": "Cartilage endplate (CEP) cell calcification and apoptosis play a vital role in the intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Oxidative stress is a key factor in inducing programmed cell death and cartilage calcification. However, the cell death and calcification of cartilage endplate cells under oxidative stress have never been described. The present study investigated the apoptosis and calcification in the cartilage endplate cell under oxidative stress induced by HO to understand the underlying mechanism of IVDD. The cartilage endplate cells isolated from human lumbar discs were subjected to different concentrations of HO for various time periods. The cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay, whereas Western blot, immunofluorescence, and Alcian blue, Alizarin red, and Von Kossa staining evaluated the apoptosis and calcification. The level of mitochondria-specific reactive oxygen species (ROS) was quantified with an oxygen radical-sensitive probe-MitoSOX. The potential signaling pathways were investigated by Western blot after the addition of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). We found that the oxidative stress induced by HO increased the apoptosis and subsequently the calcification in the cartilage endplate cells through the ROS/p38/ERK/p65 pathway. The apoptosis and the calcification of the cartilage endplate cells induced by HO can be abolished by NAC. These results suggested that regulating the apoptosis and the calcification in the cartilage endplate cells under oxidative stress should be advantageous for the survival of cells and might delay the process of disc degeneration.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have concluded that hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis were related to intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). The presence of oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and the expression of lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1) have not been explored in this tissue. In this study, we investigated the presence of ox-LDL and the expression of its receptor LOX-1 in non-degenerated, degenerated or herniated human intervertebral discs (IVDs). The expression of LOX-1 and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) were studied after incubating nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) with ox-LDL. The presence of ox-LDL and LOX-1 was positively related with the extent of IVDD in nucleus pulposus (NP), end-plate cartilage and outer annulus fibrous, but not with the extent of degeneration of inter annulus fibrous. Ox-LDL significantly reduced the viability of human NPCs in a dose and time-dependent manner, and increased the expression of MMP3 induced by LOX-1. Pretreatment with anti-human LOX-1 monoclonal antibody reversed these effects. Ox-LDL, principally mediated by LOX-1, enhanced MMP3 production in NPCs through the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. In conclusion, increased accumulation of ox-LDL and LOX-1 in IVDs indicates a specific role of the receptor-ligand interaction in degeneration or herniation of IVDs.",

The purpose of the study is to obtain three-dimensional (3D) morphological characteristics of lumbar intervertebral foramen and their relationship with age. Pedicle-superior articular process (P-SAP), disc height between adjacent vertebra (DH), pedicle-inferior vertebrae (P-IV), inferior posterior vertebrae-superior articular process (IPV-SAP), and bony boundary area (BBA) were measured in entrance, middle slice, and exit of lumbar intervertebral foramen for 25 males of different age groups. Spinous process to intervertebral foramen entrance (SP-IFE) was measured for 25 males of different age groups. Overall, P-SAP and P-IV decreased and IPV-SAP increased from the entrance to the exit of intervertebral foramen for L3/4-L5S1. DH decreased at entrance slice, middle slice, and exit slice for L3/4-L5S1 with age. Significant difference with aging was found only at the middle slice of L3/4 and L4/5 for P-SAP. And the significant decrease of IPV-SAP was observed at middle slice of L3/4, entrance slice of L4/5 and L5S1, and exit slice of L5S1. SP-IFE is not consistent for all subjects. In addition, the decrease of BBA at L3/4 and L4/5 was observed earlier than at L5S1. The present study described detailed information of intervertebral foramen, which may be of benefit for better understanding of the pathology and surgical planning for intervertebral foramen diseases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study aims to compare the advantages and disadvantage of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) and standard discectomy (SD) for the treatment of lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (LDH). We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases for relevant trials that compare PELD and SD for the treatment of LDH. The Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s Revman 5.3 software was used for data analyses. This meta-analysis compiled 1301 cases from four random controlled trials and three retrospective studies. Compared with SD, PELD showed a shorter operative time (mean difference (MD)\u00a0=\u00a0\u221218.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): \u221224.92 to \u221212.43;  p  p  p  p  p \u00a0=\u00a00.14), Macnab criteria at the final follow up (MD\u00a0=\u00a01.04, 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.50,  p \u00a0=\u00a00.82), complications (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.76, 95% CI: 0.40 to 1.43,  p \u00a0=\u00a00.39), recurrence rate (risk ratio (RR)\u00a0=\u00a01.00, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.64,  p \u00a0=\u00a01) and reoperation rate (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.40, 95% CI: 0.90 to 2.16,  p \u00a0=\u00a00.13). In conclusion, despite PELD showing significant benefit in short term outcomes such as hospital course and mean disability period, similar clinical efficacy and long term outcomes were observed when compared to SD. Therefore, we suggest that PELD can be a feasible alternative to the conventional posterior approach for the LDH depending on surgeon preference and indication. High-quality randomized controlled trials with sufficient large sample sizes necessary further confirm these results.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore the morphological changes in L4/5 intervertebral foramen with age using a digital method. The closed boundaries of the intervertebral foramen (IGES) in different sagittal slices (inside, middle and outside) were obtained from Mimics, and then imported to a custom-written program, which provided quantitative distance between the nerve root and the closed curves. The quantitative information of each age group was used to produce radar chart and line chart for morphological and statistical analyses. Overall, the intervertebral foramen changes mainly occurred in the inner part from middle age to old age. The foraminal height decreased with age in the inside sagittal slice, while no significant difference was found in the middle sagittal slice or the outside sagittal slice. The foraminal width showed no decrease in each age group or each sagittal plane. The present study described foraminal geometry of asymptomatic males in different sagittal slices with age. This information enhances the knowledge of anatomical changes in intervertebral foramen with age, which provides better understanding of the pathology of intervertebral foramen diseases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Fractures of the thoracolumbar (TL) spine represent 90% of all spinal fractures, followed by cervical and lumbar spine fractures. This study aimed to create fracture maps of the traumatic thoracolumbar (TL) fracture vertebral body (T12-L2) through the use of CT mapping as a big data visualization method to reveal recurrent patterns and characteristics of traumatic TL fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS A consecutive series of 174 fractured vertebrae (T12-L2) was used to create three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction images, which were superimposed and oriented to fit a model vertebral template by aligning specific bio-landmarks and reducing reconstructed fracture fragments. Fracture lines were found and traced to create a fracture map of the vertebral body. RESULTS Our study consisted of 165 patients with an average age of 47 years. A total of 174 fractured vertebrae were collected, consisting of 59 T12 vertebral fractures, 60 L1 vertebral fractures, and 55 L2 vertebral fractures. Two-dimensional (2D) maps, 3D maps, and heat maps showed that the fracture lines tended to be concentrated in the upper third and anterior third of the vertebral body, as well as being distributed in annular wedges along the anterior and lateral sides of the vertebral body. When compared with T12, the distribution of fracture lines in L1 and especially in L2 was more scattered and disorganized. CONCLUSIONS Fracture maps revealed recurrent patterns and characteristics of the traumatic TL fracture vertebral body, which improves understanding of TL fractures, as well as helping to increase opportunities for follow-up research and aid clinical decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a clinical challenge worldwide because of the complicated inhibitory microenvironment formed post-injury, reduced axonal regenerative ability of spinal cord neurons, and scarcity of endogenous neurogenesis within the lesion center. Taxol, in addition to stabilizing microtubules, has shown potential for decreasing axonal degeneration and reducing scar formation after SCI in rodents. In this study, we further verified the therapeutic effects and clinical potential of Taxol on restriction of scar formation and promotion of neuronal regeneration and functional recovery after severe spinal cord transection in a large animal (canine) model. A linear-ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) combined with Taxol was implanted into the injury site after the complete removal of 1 cm of spinal tissue. Afterwards, diligent nursing and multi-system rehabilitation were carried out during a half-year period of observation. The results showed that LOCS + Taxol implantation markedly promoted motor-evoked potentials and locomotion recovery. Moreover, histological analysis demonstrated that LOCS + Taxol implantation significantly increased neurogenesis and axon regeneration to reconnect the spinal cord stumps. Additionally, reduced glial scar formation was observed within the lesion site. Thus, LOCS + Taxol implantation treatment is a promising combinatorial therapy for the treatment of acute long-distance spinal cord defects.",

In contrast to most in\u00a0vivo animal tests, two permanent cell lines, murine fibroblasts (BALB/c\u20113T3 cells) and murine embryonic stem cells (mES\u2011D3 cells), are used in EST instead of animals in standard tests of toxicity. The embryotoxic potential of compounds (non, weak or strong embryotoxicity) may be obtained with a biostatistics\u2011based prediction model and calculated from three different experimental endpoint values: The potency to inhibit growth of i) BALB/c\u20113T3 cells and ii) mES\u2011D3 cells (IC503T3 and IC50ES) as presented using a cell cytotoxicity assay, and iii) the potency to inhibit differentiation of mES\u2011D3 cells into contracting cardiomyocytes (ID50 D3) as demonstrated in a mES\u2011D3 cell differentiation assay. In the present study, a model of EST with mES\u2011D3 cells and BALB/c\u20113T3 cells was established, according to the standard EST system of the EU Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods, and verified it with 5\u2011fluorouracil (strong embryotoxicity) as a positive control and penicillin G (non\u2011embryotoxic) as a negative control. In addition, the authors further assessed the embryotoxicity of four compounds (eugenol, carnosic acid, procyanidin and dioctyl phthalate) with this model. The embryotoxic potentials of the four compounds were successfully classified by the EST system. Eugenol exhibited strong embryotoxicity, carnosic acid and dioctyl phthalate exhibited weak embryotoxicity, while procyanidin exhibited non\u2011embryotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) repair is one of the most desirable but extremely challenging clinical problems. Developing suitable animal models and validating the therapeutic interventions in these models is the prerequisite for SCI repair improvement. Non-human primates, closer to humans than other species, are considered to be ideal models for translating laboratory discoveries into human clinical trials. In this study, the acute thoracic (T9) complete transection model in rhesus monkeys was established to evaluate the effects of linear-ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) and LOCS combined with collagen binding neurotrophin-3 (CBD-NT3), which has been demonstrated to promote axonal regrowth and functional restoration in rodent models. After 10 months post-surgery, the grafted groups dramatically reduced cystic cavity formation and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) deposition and facilitated the ingrowth of axonal fibers at the lesion site. Further, the grafted groups displayed more regenerated fibers, exhibiting remyelination and synapse formation. Notably, the LOCS+CBD-NT3 group showed significant locomotor and electrophysiological recovery compared with the Control and LOCS groups. Therefore, LOCS+CBD-NT3 transplantation represents an effective strategy to promote spinal cord repair in non-human primates. More importantly, this complete transection model in non-human primate will contribute to effectively evaluating the potential interventions and accelerating clinical transformation in the future.",

However, the characteristics of spontaneous locomotor recovery and its associated neurobiological mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we observed that spontaneous locomotor function recovery of hind limbs could also be detected in a canine thoracic (T8) spinal cord complete transection model. In addition, the spontaneous locomotor recovery of canines could be further promoted by chronic implantation of Taxol- or human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-modified bio-scaffolds. Moreover, functional bio-scaffolds implantation promoted locomotor outcome could be significantly weakened (drop to the spontaneous recovery level) but not totally abolished by resection in the lesion site. The neurological mechanism for functional bio-scaffolds improved locomotor outcome was primarily dependent on the formation of neuronal bridging but not the long-distance regeneration of descending motor axons throughout the lesion gap. Besides that, we found that spontaneously achieved locomotor recovery of hind limbs was unable to be weaken by repetitive resection of the lesion area, indicating the mechanism for spontaneous locomotor recovery was independent on functional neurological bridging throughout the lesion gap.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment planning is conventionally performed in a manual fashion. Yet it is highly desirable to perform computerized automated planning to improve treatment planning efficiency, eliminate human errors, and reduce plan quality variation. The goal of this research is to develop an automatic treatment planning tool for HDR brachytherapy with a cylinder applicator for vaginal cancer.Methods:After inserting the cylinder applicator into the patient, a CT scan was acquired and was loaded to an in-house developed treatment planning software. The cylinder applicator was automatically segmented using image-processing techniques. CTV was generated based on user-specified treatment depth and length. Locations of relevant points (apex point, prescription point, and vaginal surface point), central applicator channel coordinates, and dwell positions were determined according to their geometric relations with the applicator. Dwell time was computed through an inverse optimization process. The planning information was written into DICOM-RT plan and structure files to transfer the automatically generated plan to a commercial treatment planning system for plan verification and delivery.Results:We have tested the system retrospectively in nine patients treated with vaginal cylinder applicator. These cases were selected with different treatment prescriptions, lengths, depths, and cylinder diameters to represent a large patient population. Our system was able to generate treatment plans for these cases with clinically acceptable quality. Computation time varied from 3\u20136 min.Conclusion:We have developed a system to perform automated treatment planning for HDR brachytherapy with a cylinder applicator. Such a novel system has greatly improved treatment planning efficiency and reduced plan quality variation. It also served as a testbed to demonstrate the feasibility of automatic HDR treatment planning for more complicated cases.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:Plan specific quality assurance (QA) is an important step in high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy to ensure the integrity of a treatment plan. The conventional approach is to assemble a set of plan screen-captures in a document and have an independent plan-checker to verify it. Not only is this approach cumbersome and time-consuming, using a document also limits the items that can be verified, hindering plan quality and patient safety. We have initiated efforts to develop a web-based HDR brachytherapy QA system called AutoBrachy QA, for comprehensive and efficient QA. This abstract reports a new plugin in this system for the QA of a cylinder HDR brachytherapy treatment.Methods:A cylinder plan QA module was developed using Python. It was plugged into our AutoBrachy QA system. This module extracted information from CT images and treatment plan. Image processing techniques were employed to obtain geometric parameters, e.g. cylinder diameter. A comprehensive set of eight geometrical and eight dosimetric features of the plan were validated against user specified planning parameter, such as prescription value, treatment depth and length, etc. A PDF document was generated, consisting of a summary QA sheet with all the QA results, as well as images showing plan details.Results:The cylinder QA program has been implemented in our clinic. To date, it has been used in 11 patient cases and was able to successfully perform QA tests in all of them. The QA program reduced the average plan QA time from 7 min using conventional manual approach to 0.5 min.Conclusion:Being a new module in our AutoBrachy QA system, an automated treatment plan QA module for cylinder HDR brachytherapy has been successfully developed and clinically implemented. This module improved clinical workflow and plan integrity compared to the conventional manual approach.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To put forth an innovative clinical paradigm for weekly chart checking so that treatment status is periodically checked accurately and efficiently. This study also aims to help optimize the chart checking clinical workflow in a busy radiation therapy clinic.Methods:It is mandated by the Texas Administrative code to check patient charts of radiation therapy once a week or every five fractions, however it varies drastically among institutions in terms of when and how it is done. Some do it every day, but a lot of efforts are wasted on opening ineligible charts; some do it on a fixed day but the distribution of intervals between subsequent checks is not optimal. To establish an optimal chart checking procedure, a new paradigm was developed to achieve 1) charts are checked more accurately and more efficiently; 2) charts are checked on optimal days without any miss; 3) workload is evened out throughout a week when multiple physicists are involved. All active charts will be accessed by querying the Ru0026V system. Priority is assigned to each chart based on the number of days before the next due date followed by sorting and workload distribution steps. New charts are also taken into account when distributing the workload so it is reasonably even throughout the week.Results:Our clinical workflow became more streamlined and smooth. In addition, charts get checked in a more timely fashion so that errors would get caught earlier should they occur.Conclusion:We developed a new weekly chart checking diagram. It helps physicists check charts in a timely manner, saves their time in busy clinics, and consequently reduces possible errors.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:This proof-of-concept study is to develop a real-time Monte Carlo (MC) based treatment-dose reconstruction and monitoring system for radiotherapy, especially for the treatments with complicated delivery, to catch treatment delivery errors at the earliest possible opportunity and interrupt the treatment only when an unacceptable dosimetric deviation from our expectation occurs.Methods:First an offline scheme is launched to pre-calculate the expected dose from the treatment plan, used as ground truth for real-time monitoring later. Then an online scheme with three concurrent threads is launched while treatment delivering, to reconstruct and monitor the patient dose in a temporally resolved fashion in real-time. Thread T1 acquires machine status every 20 ms to calculate and accumulate fluence map (FM). Once our accumulation threshold is reached, T1 transfers the FM to T2 for dose reconstruction ad starts to accumulate a new FM. A GPU-based MC dose calculation is performed on T2 when MC dose engine is ready and a new FM is available. The reconstructed instantaneous dose is directed to T3 for dose accumulation and real-time visualization. Multiple dose metrics (e.g. maximum and mean dose for targets and organs) are calculated from the current accumulated dose and compared with the pre-calculated expected values. Once the discrepancies go beyond our tolerance, an error message will be send to interrupt the treatment delivery.Results:A VMAT Head-and-neck patient case was used to test the performance of our system. Real-time machine status acquisition was simulated here. The differences between the actual dose metrics and the expected ones were 0.06%\u20130.36%, indicating an accurate delivery. \u223c10Hz frequency of dose reconstruction and monitoring was achieved, with 287.94s online computation time compared to 287.84s treatment delivery time.Conclusion:Our study has demonstrated the feasibility of computing a dose distribution in a temporally resolved fashion in real-time and quantitatively and dosimetrically monitoring the treatment delivery.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Medial elbow incision is obligatory for cubital tunnel syndrome surgical treatment. However, the terminal branches of both the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (MACN) and the medial brachial cutaneous nerve (MBCN) are likely to be harmed using the current incision technique. The aim of this study was to seek a new incision to avoid damaging the branches of MACN and MBCN during the operation for cubital tunnel syndrome. Methods: Ten fresh frozen cadaver upper extremities and 20 clinical cases (elbows) were analyzed. A conventional incision and a new incision were used in the cadaveric specimens and the clinical cases, respectively. The medial epicondyle was set as the reference landmark to quantify the location of the terminal branches, with the elbow at full extension. The numbers of the terminal branches and their locations were noted for MACN and MBCN, and the locations of the posterior branch of the MACN were recorded in the elbow medial incision. Results: The average numbers of MACN\u2019s po...",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for enabling the reliability-differentiated services in a residential distribution network with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). A reliability-differentiated pricing mechanism is developed to satisfy the different reliability requirements of the customers while encouraging the customers to consume electricity in such a way that the reliability of the overall distribution system can be enhanced. A dynamic spinning reserve pricing scheme is developed to stimulate PHEVs to participate in spinning reserve by providing economic benefits when the state of the distribution system becomes risky. Based on the formulated reliability-differentiated system, a hierarchical game approach is proposed in this paper to coordinate the charging process of PHEVs in a decentralized fashion. At the upper level of the hierarchical game, an evolutionary game is formulated to optimize the management of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capacity of each PHEV. Under the V2G strategies obtained from the evolutionary game, a noncooperative game is formulated at the lower level to coordinate the charging sequences of PHEVs. Various simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical game approach. The simulation results show that the hierarchical game approach is effective in enhancing both reliability of the distribution system and economic profits of the PHEVs.",

        "abstract": "As a new form of distributed energy resources, massive plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) could affect the power distribution system adequacy considering their intermittent charging loads and the load recovery ability during system outages. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for adequacy evaluation of power distribution networks with PHEVs penetration. A condition-dependent outage model is used in this paper to obtain the time sequential failure rate of the transformer. Also, a business model for the PHEVs is developed to encourage the PHEV owners to charge their vehicles in such a way that the distribution system adequacy is enhanced. Based on this model, a smart charging algorithm is proposed for the PHEVs to minimize their charging cost and enhance the adequacy of the distribution network at the same time. Various simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed smart charging approach. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is effective in enhancing both the adequacy of the distribution network and economic profits of PHEVs.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an integrated electric vehicle (EV) charging navigation framework, which takes into consideration the impacts from both the power system and transportation system. The proposed framework links the power system with transportation system through the charging navigation of massive EVs. It benefits the two systems by attracting EVs to charge at off-peak hours and saving the time of EV owners with real-time navigation. Based on the formulated framework, a hierarchical game approach is proposed in this paper to effectively navigate EVs to electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). At the upper level of the hierarchical game, a non-cooperative game is proposed to model the competition between EVCSs. Based on the pricing strategies obtained from the non-cooperative game, multiple evolutionary games are formulated at the lower level to evolve EVs\u2019 strategies in choosing EVCSs. The simulation results show that the proposed integrated charging navigation approach is effective in improving both the reliability of the power distribution grid and economic profits of the charging stations.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a holistic framework for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to participate in frequency regulation in a competitive electricity market. It is challenging to use PHEVs as frequency regulation units since conflicts of interests exist among PHEVs, aggregators, and transmission system operator (TSO). PHEVs are also facing various uncertainties from power prices and the available regulation capacities. These challenges motivate us to model the system using a hierarchical game. At the upper level of the hierarchical game, the frequency regulation capacity bids of aggregators are formulated as a non-cooperative game. Based on the frequency regulation prices obtained from the non-cooperative game, we formulate a Markov game to coordinate the charging process of PHEVs at the lower level. The Markov game will optimize the regulation capacity of the aggregator and strengthen its ability in bidding a more favorable frequency regulation price in the upper level game. Thus, the benefits are well coordinated among PHEVs, aggregators, and TSO in the proposed game-theoretic framework. Furthermore, the uncertainties from power prices and available regulation capacities are elegantly handled by the proposed non-cooperative game and Markov game, respectively. Finally, various simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical game approach.",

This paper proposes a new method to evaluate the active distribution system reliability including microgrid and energy storage. The power output of distributed generator (DG) within the microgrid is first calculated based on the approach of generalized capacity outage tables (GCOTs). Then Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is utilized for performing power system reliability evaluation. The results obtained considering different energy storage capacities are compared. Furthermore, real-time pricing (RTP) strategy is considered in optimizing the control strategy of the energy storage device and the corresponding reliability indices are recalculated.",

The polarization smoothing generalized multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which combines polarization smoothing and generalized MUSIC algorithm for polarization sensitive arrays (PSAs), was proposed to solve this problem in this paper. Firstly, the polarization smoothing pre-processing was exploited to eliminate the coherence between the direct and the specular signals. Secondly, we constructed the generalized MUSIC algorithm for low angle estimation. Finally, based on the geometry information of the symmetry multipath model, the proposed algorithm was introduced to convert the two-dimensional searching into one-dimensional searching, thus reducing the computational burden. Numerical results were provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that the proposed algorithm has significantly improved angle estimation performance in the low-angle area compared with the available methods, especially when the grazing angle is near zero.",

The results indicate that the phase difference of multipath signal and SNR loss of received signals are the main reason of CRB fluctuate in the low angle area. In addition, the CRB of Multipath Model-I has the singular point of angle estimation when the phase difference of multipath signal is in phase or revised, while the CRB of Multipath Model-II has the singular point only when the phase difference of multipath signal is reversed. Meanwhile, the Multipath Model-III that utilizes both the geometry of multipath model and reflection coefficient has the lowest CRB than other multipath conditions. The CRB of horizontal polarization is more stable than CRB of vertical polarization for different ground scenarios under Multipath Model-I.

        "abstract": "The insecticide acetamiprid is used to control noxious agricultural pests. However, it can cause mammalian toxicity. We evaluated the reproductive toxicity of acetamiprid in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were given oral acetamiprid alone or with vitamin E for 35 days. Rat plasma testosterone concentration and sperm quality decreased significantly as the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) increased after exposure. At the same time, acetamiprid increased malondialdehyde and nitric oxide (NO) levels of Leydig cells. Further analysis showed that acetamiprid reduced the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production of Leydig cells, but the expression of luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) and the activity of adenylyl cyclase were not changed. Acetamiprid exposure also significantly diminished protein levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR), hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase cluster (HSD3B), and cytochrome P450, family 11, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (CYP11A1), and testicular mRNA levels, which are cAMP-dependent proteins that are essential for steroidogenesis. Electron microscopy indicated mitochondrial membrane damage in the Leydig cells of the testes of exposed rats. Vitamin E ameliorated the impairment of acetamiprid on Leydig cells. Our results indicate that acetamiprid causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in Leydig cells and inhibits the synthesis of testicular ATP and cAMP. Acetamiprid disrupts subsequent testosterone biosynthesis by decreasing the rate of conversion of cholesterol to testosterone and by preventing cholesterol from entering the mitochondria within the Leydig cells. These effects caused reproductive damage to the rats.",

Dallas has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine and there are several clinical evidences to support its anticancer activity. However, the anticancer active ingredients present in  remain unidentified. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer effects of a methanol extract of  (AME). Gas chromatography mass spectrometry was used to analyse the chemical composition of AME. The cell viability of MDA-MB-453 and HCC-1937 cells treated with different concentrations of AME was detected by MTT assay and the ratio of cells in different cell cycle phases was analysed by flow cytometry. The expression of genes associated with cell cycle was analysed by real-time PCR assay. The results showed that oleic acid (25.39%) and palmitic acid (21.798%) are the main anticancer compounds present in AME. There was a concentration-dependent decrease in the proliferation of MDA-MB-453 and HCC-1937 cells. Moreover, treatment with AME induced a S-phase arrest in the cells. Real-time PCR assay demonstrated that AME could significantly downregulate the expression of , , , , and  mRNAs and upregulate the expression of  mRNA.

In order to alter the chemical pretreatment which is not suitable for local processing and not environmentally friendly for operating personnel, laser surface texturing (LST) was applied in electroless nickel plating on alumina in this paper.  The electroless nickel plating was carried out on alumina surfaces that were either chemically coarsened or laser textured with different pit depths. The morphology of textured alumina surfaces was characterized by optical microscope and 3D laser confocal microscope, while its surface roughness was measured by a TA620 roughness tester. The adhesive performance of nickel coatings was evaluated by indentation and scratch tests.  The results showed that laser surface texturing can improve the adhesive performance of electroless plated nickel coating on the alumina samples. The critical load of the properly laser surface textured samples is more than 2 times of that of the chemically coarsened samples. For the process of electroless nickel plating, laser surface texturing can replace traditionally chemically coarsening pretreatment, which can reduce the contact opportunity with strong acid for operating personnel.",

The effects of ultrasonic power and pulse-on time on the microstructure and mechanical properties of composite coatings were investigated. The morphology of the coatings was observed by scanning electron microscopy, and the content of chromium in the coating was measured by EDS spectrometer. The coating hardness was measured by a micro-hardness tester, and the friction coefficient was evaluated by a tribotester. The results show that both the power and the mode of the ultrasonic had a significant influence on composite codeposition. With the optimized deposition parameters, the Co-Cr 3 C 2  composite coating containing u003e\u00a030% Cr 3 C 2  particles was obtained, which yields the highest hardness and the lowest friction coefficient.",

Buckwheat honey has higher contents of sugars, proteins and total phenols but a lower content of MGO than manuka honey. Buckwheat honey contains abundant minerals involved in a number of vital functions of the human body as does manuka honey, and has even higher contents of Fe, Mn and Zn. In buckwheat honey, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid are the dominant phenolic compounds. Moreover, the antibacterial and cellular antioxidant activities of buckwheat honey were compared with those of manuka honey. Buckwheat honey exhibits antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, comparable with manuka honey, and the cellular antioxidant activity of buckwheat honey is higher than that of manuka honey. Our results suggest that buckwheat honey has great nutritional and commercial potentials.",

Based on the analysis of the mutually conjugated, only two diagrams were the best topological embryonic graphs to build the predominance area diagram of Me-S-O system. Combined with topological rules and thermodynamic calculation, four relation-diagrams were denoted as \u03b1 and \u03b2 stable and unstable plane-topological diagrams, which were plotted for the Pb-S-O system and Zn-S-O system. The results show that \u03b2 stable plane-topological diagram of Pb-S-O system and \u03b1 stable one of Zn-S-O system are in accordance with the traditional predominance area diagram, which indicates that it is feasible to plot the predominance area diagram based on mathematical topological rules. Meanwhile, \u03b1 unstable plane-topological diagram of Pb-S-O system can elucidate the phenomenon that metallic lead exists in higher oxygen and sulfur pressure area in modern bath smelting furnace. The mathematical topological rules broaden the application scope of the predominance area diagram and enrich the practice of its plotting.",

        "abstract": "The recovery of iron from iron sinking slag and lead smelter slag was investigated by desulfurization-reduction bath smelting. The effects of lead smelter slag (LSS) to iron sinking slag (ISS) mass ratio and temperature were investigated in desulfurization experiments. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses show that the optimum conditions are LSS:ISS of 3:7 and temperature of 1350\u00b0C. The composition of desulfurization products is mainly ZnFe2O4, and the desulfurization rate of 99.66% is obtained under optimum conditions. The thermogravimetric (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analyses demonstrate that reductant is necessary for decomposition and reduction of zinc ferrite in desulfurization product. The effects of reductant, temperature and feeding modes on iron enrichment were investigated in reduction experiments. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) determination show that the iron content of reduction product is up to 99.36% under optimum conditions of coke as reductant, reduction temperature of 1450\u00b0C and the feeding mode of premixing.",

        "abstract": "Due to complex and nonlinear dynamic model, speed tracking control with high precision and robustness is always a hard-deal task for autonomous vehicle control. In recent years, learning methods are gradually used to solve many complex control problems through the observed data from the real control systems. In this paper, a speed tracking controller is designed based on online continuous actor-critic learning. The input of the learning is the current vehicle state defined beforehand and the output is the actual brake or fuel command to track the desired speed. The online learning task is performed on a longitudinal model established based on the collected real vehicle data. An algorithm named continuous actor-critic learning Automaton(Cacla) is used for the policy learning. Simulation results illustrate that the designed controller is competent for tracking the expected speed with satisfied precision.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a parameterized batch reinforcement learning algorithm for near-optimal longitudinal control of autonomous land vehicles (ALVs). The proposed approach uses an actor-critic architecture, where parameterized feature vectors based on kernels are learned from collected samples for approximating the value functions and policies. One difference between the parameterized batch actor-critic (PBAC) algorithm and previous actor-critic learning approaches is that the critic and actor in PBAC share the same linear features, which has been theoretically proved to be a beneficial property for the convergence of actor-critic learning approaches. In order to obtain better learning efficiency, least-squares-based batch updating rules are designed for the critic and actor, respectively. Based on the PBAC learning algorithm, a data-driven longitudinal control method is presented for ALVs to obtain near-optimal control policies which adaptively tune the fuel/brake control signals to track different speeds. A multiobjective reward function is designed so that both tracking precision and driving smoothness are considered. Extensive experiments were conducted on a real ALV platform while driving on flat, slippery, sloping, and bumpy roads. The experimental results illustrate the superiority of the PBAC-based self-learning controller over conventional longitudinal control methods such as proportional-integral (PI) control and learning-based PI control.",

        "abstract": "In this work, tungsten carbide particles (WC, spherical and irregular particles)-reinforced iron matrix composites were manufactured utilizing a liquid sintering technique. The mechanical properties and the fracture mechanism of WC/iron matrix composites were investigated theoretically and experimentally. The crack schematic diagram and fracture simulation diagram of WC/iron matrix composites were summarized, indicating that the micro-crack was initiated both from the interface for spherical and irregular WC/iron matrix composites. However, irregular WC had a tendency to form spherical WC. The micro-cracks then expanded to a wide macro-crack at the interface, leading to a final failure of the composites. In comparison with the spherical WC, the irregular WC were prone to break due to the stress concentration resulting in being prone to generating brittle cracking. The study on the fracture mechanisms of WC/iron matrix composites might provide a theoretical guidance for the design and engineering application of particle reinforced composites.",

The external ear was reconstructed using a delayed postauricular skin flap in patients with congenital microtia. After the first stage of delaying the postauricular skin flap and the second stage of otoplasty with ear framework fabricated from autogenous rib cartilage draping with the delayed skin flap, the third stage involved tragus and external auditory meatus canaloplasty. After designing the remnant auricle flap, the lower part was trimmed and the tragus was reconstructed. The upper part was trimmed into a thin skin flap, which was rotated and used to cover the hollowed wound posterosuperior to the tragus so as to mimic the external auditory meatus. If remnant wounds were present, skin grafting was conducted. In total, 121 patients with congenital microtia were treated from March 2010 to March 2016. The reconstructed tragus and external auditory meatus were well formed, and all wounds healed well. No severe complications such as flap necrosis occurred. Six months postoperatively, the morphology of the reconstructed tragus and external auditory meatus was good. Overall, the patients and their families were satisfied. The use of remnant auricle to reconstruct the tragus and external auditory meatus is an effective auricular reconstruction technique.",

After depositing a 9/13 nm thick Au film on periodically poled lithium niobate, TiO of about 2.3 \u03bcm in thickness is evaporated on the sample as a refractive-index-matching material. This dielectric (periodically poled lithium niobate)-metal(Au)-dielectric(TiO) sandwich structure can support the transmission of long-range surface plasmon polaritons through it. By designing a moderate ferroelectric domain period of periodically poled lithium niobate, the phase mismatch between the fundamental wave and second harmonic wave of the long-range surface plasmon polaritons can be compensated and a second harmonic wave can be generated effectively. This can be used to provide integrated plasmonic devices with attractive applications in quantum and classic information processing.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have attracted renewed interest owing to their remarkable physical and chemical properties. Similar to that of graphene, the atomic thickness of TMDCs significantly limits their optoelectronic applications. In this study, we report a hybrid WS-optical-fiber-nanowire (WOFN) structure for broadband enhancement of the light-matter interactions, i.e., light absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and second-harmonic generation (SHG), through evanescent field coupling. The interactions between the anisotropic light field of an optical fiber nanowire (OFN) and the anisotropic second-order susceptibility tensor of WS are systematically studied theoretically and experimentally. In particular, an efficient SHG in the WOFN appears to be 20 times larger than that in the same OFN before the WS integration under the same conditions. Moreover, we show that strain can efficiently manipulate the PL and SHG in the WOFN owing to the large configurability of the silica OFN. Our results demonstrate the potential applications of waveguide-coupled TMDCs structures for tunable high-performance photonic devices.",

The template stripping process is introduced to reduce SPP propagation losses, improving SERS sensitivity by \u223c40. Apart from flexibility and a moderate SERS enhancement factor of the order of 105\u2013106, the SPP band structure is highly reproducible with a relative standard deviation of 10.9%.

This work aimed to assess variations in the chemical components and antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibitory activities of S. japonica extract during five flower maturity stages (ES1-ES5). The results showed that the contents of total flavonoids, rutin, and narcissin were highest at ES1, whereas the contents of quercetin and isorhamnetin were highest at ES3. ES1 presented considerable antioxidant activities in terms of reducing power (RP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH\u00b7)- and OH\u00b7-scavenging capacity, whereas ES3 showed excellent tyrosinase inhibitory activity and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical (ABTS\u00b7+)- and O-scavenging capacity. Rutin and quercetin are the main bioactive components of FFB-SJ with antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibition, and the immature flower buds of S. japonica (S2-S3) with excellent biological activities and relatively high extract yields were the best for product development.",

        "abstract": "Inducing production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important criterion to distinguish the bactericidal antibiotics from bacteriostatic antibiotics. Selenoenzymes were generally recognized to be a powerful antioxidant capable of scavenging free radicals, protecting the cells from the harmful effects of ROS. Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the selenium (Se)-mediated protection in reversing antibiotic sensitivity and the role of selenoenzymes in alleviating the negative effects of oxidative stress. The cellular antioxidant activity of Se-enriched bacteria was analyzed, as well as intracellular ROS production and elimination when Se-enriched bacteria in the presence of various antibiotics. Compared to complete inhibition of the parental strain by bactericidal antibiotics, it only exhibited slight and reversible inhibition of Se-enriched Escherichia coli ATCC25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 at the same conditions, which indicated that intracellular selenium provided substantial protection against antibiotics. ROS generation caused by bactericidal antibiotics was confirmed by fluorescence spectrophotometry using 2', 7'-dichloro- uorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) as substrate. The time course experiments of pretreatment with selenium showed significant decrease of ROS level at 2h. In summary, the present study provides experimental evidence supporting selenoenzymes has good scavenging effect to ROS and can protect bacteria from oxidative stress injury induced by bactericidal antibiotics.",

We assessed the growth, Se accumulation, and Se biotransformation of B. longum DD98 and its effects on antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbacteriosis in mice. The viable bacterial count at the end of fermentation was not significantly affected by the presence of Se. Bifidobacterium longum DD98 took up inorganic Se from the medium and biotransformed it into Se-containing proteins and selenoamino acids. The dominant Se species was selenomethionine (SeMet), which comprised 87% of the total Se in Se-B. longum DD98. Furthermore, Se-B. longum DD98 showed better regulation of the disrupted intestinal microbiota back to normal levels and repaired damaged colon tissues compared to the natural recovery and B. longum DD98 treatments. These findings suggest that B. longum DD98 efficiently biotransformed inorganic Se into more bioactive organic Se forms and may have therapeutic potential for the restoration of antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbacteriosis.",

        "abstract": "Activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is a cellular survival mechanism in response to chemotherapy in cancers. In this work, we demonstrate that targeting eIF4E by ribavirin sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell response to doxorubicin. Ribavirin inhibits growth and survival of HCC cells, and to a greater extent than in normal liver cells. Its combination with doxorubicin achieves greater efficacy than single drug in vitro and in vivo. Ribavirin suppresses phosphorylation of molecules involved in Akt/mTOR/eIF4E pathway. Overexpression of the phosphomimetic form (S209D) but not the nonphosphorylatable form (S209A) eIF4E significantly reverses the inhibitory effects of ribavirin. Interestingly, doxorubicin significantly increases p-eIF4E(S209) level in a dose- and time-dependent manner, suggesting that doxorubicin induces eIF4E activation in HCC cells. In addition, eIF4E activation induced by doxorubicin in HCC cells is inhibited by ribavirin. Our work demonstrates the greater efficacy of ribavirin and doxorubicin combination and its underlying mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Targeting mitochondrial metabolism has been recently demonstrated to be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of various cancer. In this work, we demonstrate that antibiotic tigecycline is selectively against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage. Tigecycline is more effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of HCC than normal liver cells. Importantly, tigecycline significantly enhances the inhibitory effects of chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin in HCC in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Mechanistically, tigecycline specifically inhibits mitochondrial translation as shown by the decreased protein levels of Cox-1 and -2 but not Cox-4 or Grp78, and increased mRNA levels of Cox-1 and -2 but not Cox-4 in HCC cells exposed to tigecycline. In addition, tigecycline significantly induces mitochondrial dysfunction in HCC cells via decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, complex I and IV activities, mitochondrial respiration and ATP levels. Tigecycline also increases levels of mitochondrial superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and ROS levels. Consistent with oxidative stress, oxidative damage on DNA, protein and lipid are also observed in tigecycline-treated cells. Importantly, antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) reverses the effects of tigecycline, suggesting that oxidative stress is required for the action of tigecycline in HCC cells. We further show that HCC cells have higher level of mitochondrial biogenesis than normal liver cells which might explain the different sensitivity to tigecycline between HCC and normal liver cells. Our work is the first to demonstrate that tigecycline is a promising candidate for HCC treatment and highlight the therapeutic value of targeting mitochondrial metabolism in HCC.",

Here, a total of 101 ovarian endometriosis samples were analyzed for the presence of these gene mutations, including KRAS, PPP2R1A, PIK3CA and ARID1A. In addition, 6 other cancer-associated genes (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, ERK1, ERK2 and PTEN) were also analyzed. In total, four somatic mutations were identified in three out of 101 ovarian endometriotic lesions (4%, 4/101), including a KRAS p.G12V, a PPP2R1A p.S256F and two ARID1A nonsense mutations (p.Q403* and p.G1926*); while no mutations were identified in the remaining 7 genes (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, ERK1, ERK2, PTEN and PIK3CA). Note that the KRAS G12V and ARID1A Q403* mutations co-occurred in a 36-year-old sample who had a high serum CA125 (308.4\u202fU/mL) and a late menarche age (18-year-old). Additionally, no mutations in any of the 10 genes were identified in either the healthy eutopic endometrial tissues from 85 control individuals without endometriosis, or in 62 healthy ovarian tissues from ovarian cysts samples (without endometriosis). Our study revealed, for the first time, the presence of classical cancer driver gene mutations in ovarian endometriosis. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of KRAS and ARID1A mutations was identified in a single individual for the first time. The observations of cancer driver gene mutations in our ovarian endometriosis samples, together with several prior observations, further support the notion that endometriosis is a premalignant disorder.",

        "abstract": "Stem cell factor (SCF), which is derived from granulosa cells (GCs), plays a key role in the process of follicular development and oocyte maturation. The present study aimed to explore whether the levels of SCF in follicular fluid (FF) and GCs can be used as a potential marker for predicting oocyte developmental potential. Follicular fluid and GC samples from 150 female patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection were collected in this study. The SCF concentrations in FFs and SCF messenger RNA (mRNA) in GCs were evaluated by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The results showed that the levels of SCF protein and mRNA were significantly associated with oocyte maturation, normal fertilization, cleavage, and embryo quality. Moreover, the levels of SCF protein and mRNA in pregnancy group were also higher than those in the nonpregnancy group. The cutoff value of SCF in FF for predicting high-quality embryo was 1.346, with a sensitivity of 57.8% and a specificity of 72.4%, and the cutoff value of SCF in GCs for predicting high-quality embryo was 6.650, with a sensitivity of 64.4% and a specificity of 78.1%. In conclusion, our results showed a positive and statistically significant relationship between SCF level and oocyte maturation, normal fertilization, cleavage, embryo quality, and clinical pregnancy. Therefore, the levels of SCF in FF and GCs might be considered as a new marker for predicting oocyte developmental potential.",

        "abstract": "Endometriosis is a complex and heterogeneous pre-malignant inflammatory disease harboring multiple gene mutations. Previous studies have suggested that caspase recruitment domain family member (CARD)10 and CARD11 mutations may exist in endometriosis. In the present study, a collection of endometriotic lesions and paired peripheral blood from 101 patients with ovarian endometriosis were obtained, and the entire coding sequences of the CARD10 and CARD11 genes were sequenced. Evolutionary conservation analysis and online prediction programs were applied to analyze the disease-causing potential of the identified mutations. A total of 4 novel somatic mutations were identified in 4 out of the 101 (4.0%) samples: 2 in-frame deletions in CARD10 (c.785_790delAGGAGA, p.K272_E273delKE; c.785_802delAGGAGAAGGAGAAGGAGA, p.K272_V277delKEPDNV) and 2 heterozygous missense mutations in CARD11 (c.49G>T, p.D17Y; c.160G>C, p.E54Q). The sample with CARD10 p.K272_E273delKE deletion was obtained from a 47-year-old patient who was also diagnosed with uterine leiomyoma, while the CARD10 p.K272_V277delKEPDNV-mutated sample was from a 43-year-old patient exhibiting a decreased blood eosinophil granulocyte ratio (0.3%) and an elevated serum creatine kinase level (314 U/l). The patient with the CARD11 p.D17Y mutation was 38 years old and exhibited an increased level of cancer antigen 125 (45.4 U/ml), while the patient with the CARD11 p.E54Q mutation was 46 years old and exhibited no other gynecological conditions. Evolutionary conservation analysis and online prediction programs suggested that these mutations may be disease-causing. In summary, 4 novel somatic mutations in the CARD10 and CARD11 genes were identified from amongst 101 cases of ovarian endometriosis for the first time, these mutations may serve active roles in the development of ovarian endometriosis.",

The proposed charging station planning framework considers the impact of the operation strategies of the electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) on both the power distribution system and transportation system. In the proposed framework, the pricing strategies of the EVCSs can affect the traffic flow by attracting electric vehicles (EVs) to charge and consequently change the load demand pattern in the power distribution network. On the contrary, the electricity market can affect the traffic flow though affecting the pricing strategies of the EVCSs. Thus, the two systems are able to be connected through the optimal placement of EVCSs. The lower operational level of the proposed approach considers the competitions among the EVCSs in a competitive charging market environment through a non-cooperative game. The upper planning level optimize the placement of EVCSs based the operation results in the lower level with cross-entropy optimization. According to the simulation results, the proposed bi-level planning approach benefits the two systems by reducing the peak load and improving the traffic conditions effectively.",

The location planning of FCS must allow for satisfactory charging service for PEV users as well as mitigate the detrimental effects on power grid caused by uncertainty and impulsiveness of charging demand. This paper proposed a location planning model for FCS, taking into account its impacts on the critical power grid assets. The multi-objective planning model simultaneously considered the role of FCS in the electricity and transportation sectors. This planning model is solved by the cross-entropy (CE) method.

Although such surfaces have been extensively studied and many advances have been achieved, a number of challenges are remained, including the optimization of structure, moderate stimuli, and so forth. In this paper, we developed a new \u201ckilling and release\u201d antibacterial surface by combining poly[2-(tert-butylamino) ethyl methacrylate] (polyTA) and poly(3-(dimethyl (4-vinylbenzyl) ammonio) propyl sulfonate) (polyDVBAPS) via mixed brushes system. The bactericidal activity of polyTA and salt-responsive property of polyDVBAPS could be well integrated in this way. Accordingly, the surface showed high bactericidal activity by killing more than 94% attached bacteria of E. coli and S. aureus and excellent release capability by detaching most attached bacteria in response to salt solution. Both bacterial killing effectiveness and release rate were well retained ...",

Briefly, nanoparticles and polymer powders were dry-mixed by ball-milling and then hot-pressed into the composites in which nanoparticles were selectively distributed at the interfaces between polymer multi-facets. Upon batch foaming using scCO 2  as blowing agent, bimodal structure was generated due to the selective distribution and heterogeneous nucleation effect of the nanoparticles. Using this method, several bimodal composite foams based on different nanoparticles, i.e. graphene, carbon nanotubes, and silica nanoparticles and different polymers, i.e. thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and polystyrene (PS) were successfully fabricated. Specifically, TPU/graphene system was systemically studied. The results showed that the foam morphologies could be easily tuned by changing nanoparticle content, particle size of polymer powder, hot-pressing temperature and pressure, as well as foaming conditions (e. g. foaming temperature and pressure), indicating the great simplicity and tune-ability of this method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Development of novel materials with dual antibacterial and antifouling functions is important for many bio-applications. In this work, we design and synthesize a series of mixed polymer brushes grafted from silica surface as a new type of antibiofouling and antimicrobial coating, which combine poly( N -hydroxyethyl acrylamide) (polyHEAA) synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) and cationic poly(trimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate chloride, polyMETAC) synthesized by photoiniferter-mediated polymerization (SI-PIMP). The surface composition, charge and morphology of the resultant mixed polymer brushes are carefully characterized and optimized by tuning ATRP and PIMP initiator ratios. The mixed polymer brushes possess strong bacterial killing ability from polyMETAC chains and high antifouling property from polyHEAA chains. At the optimal conditions, the mixed polyHEAA/polyMETAC brushes exhibit excellent anti-bacterial adhesion property by retaining ultralow cell adhesion of \u02dc3.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/cm2 and high contact killing efficiency by killing more than 90% attached bacteria of  Escherichia coli  and  Staphylococcus . Long-term antibacterial performance indicated the cell adhesion was retained at ultralow level of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/cm2 even after 72\u2009h exposure to bacteria solution. The results indicate that surface grafting with polyHEAA and polyMETAC can be potentially useful for long-term biomedical and biomaterial applications.",

        "abstract": "Polyzwitterionic brushes with strong antipolyelectrolyte effects have shown great potential as versatile platforms for the development of switchable friction/lubrication and bacterial absorption/desorption surfaces. However, the surface property switches of these brushes are usually triggered by high salt concentrations (>0.53 M), thereby greatly limiting their applications in biological fields where the salt concentration for mammals is \u223c0.15 M. To solve this problem, an electric field was used to assist the salt-responsive process of the polyzwitterionic brushes to achieve bacterial release at low concentrations of the salt solution. Briefly, poly(3-(dimethyl (4-vinylbenzyl) ammonium) propyl sulfonate) (polyDVBAPS) brushes grafted on ITO surfaces were prepared by surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization. The bacterial release of this surface was conducted under an electric field, where anions were migrated and enriched around the brush-grafted ITO surface as anode. The local high concentration ion led to the conformation change of the brush and release of the attached bacteria. The effect of salt type, salt concentration, electric field strength, and conducting time on the bacterial release properties were investigated. The results indicated that under an electrical field of 3 V/mm, polyDVBAPS showed release capacities of \u223c93% for E. coli and \u223c81% for S. aureus in 0.12 M NaCl electrolyte solution. Furthermore, by the introduction of a bactericidal agent, i.e., Triclosan (TCS), an antibacterial surface with dual functions of killing and release was fabricated. This surface could kill \u223c90% and release 95% of attached E. coli in a 0.12 M NaCl solution by the application of a 3 V/mm electric field. This work demonstrated the feasibility of triggering a salt-responsive behavior of polyzwitterionic at low salt concentration by assistance of electric field, which would greatly extend the applications of polyzwitterionic, in particular in biological applications.",

        "abstract": "Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a widespread chronic metabolic disease which hashigh mortality due to its complications. In addition to traditional medication, stem cell transplantationtherapeutics has become a brand-new and prospective remedy for DM. With strong self-renewal andmulti-potential ability, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered as ideal cell sources of celltherapy for DM and many other diseases. However, not only do endogenous MSCs fail to replace theimpaired islet cells, but also transplanted MSCs fail to cure many patients complicated with DM. Besides,quite a few DM patients suffer from high risk of fracture and low efficiency of bone regeneration,which are often associated with the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs. Recently, a number ofresearches have investigated that the changes in micro-environment by DM can affect biological characteristicsof MSCs through many factors.Summary: In this review, we summarize the developments in the influence of DM on proliferation andosteoblastic differentiation of MSCs, and moreover, osteoporosis, obesity and metabolism syndrome,as they are closely related to DM.",

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response have recently been linked to inflammation and osteogenic differentiation. Therefore, the role of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway in the impaired osteogenic differentiation ability of PDLSCs treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 was investigated.Methods: PDLSCs were isolated and stimulated with osteogenic media containing 1, 10, or 20 ng/mL TNF-\u03b1. Assessment included: 1) expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 and osteocalcin; 2) mRNA expression and activity of alkaline phosphatase; and 3) formation of mineralization nodules. Furthermore, expression of PERK pathway-related factors: 1) glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78; 2) PERK; 3) activating transcription factor (ATF) 4; and 4) CCAAT-enhancer-bind...",

        "abstract": "In this work, a colorimetric methodology was developed for free chlorine determination by constructing a fiber-optic sensor (FOS) which was designed by using a small LED as light source and two silica fibers as light transmission elements. Then the FOS was integrated with the sequential injection lab-on-valve (SI-LOV) manifold to fabricate a FOS-SI-LOV system for free chlorine detection. The colorimetric determination was based on the reaction between N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) reagent and free chlorine, which would produce a chromophore showing maximum absorbance at 511 and 551nm and detected by a micro spectrometer detector. By choosing a green LED with emission wavelength at 520nm as light source, the chlorine concentration could be simply evaluated according to Beer's law. The developed FOS-SI-LOV system showed improved performances of wide linear range (10-400\u03bcgL), low detection limit (3.5\u03bcgL, 3\u03c3), fast analysis (6.85s) and excellent repeatability (0.0083 RSD, n=8) for chlorine determination. The proposed FOS-SI-LOV system has been applied to on-line and real-time chlorine determination in different water samples with excellent selectivity. Furthermore, this FOS-SI-LOV methodology provided a colorimetric and fluorescence detection platform for other hazardous species monitoring in water environment based on Beer's law and Stern-Volmer relationship, respectively.",

        "abstract": "An interface research method based on total internal reflection induced evanescent wave (TIR-EW) is developed to monitor the adsorption behavior of azo dye at the silica-water interface. The monitoring system is constructed by employing silica optical fiber (SOF) as both charged substrate for dye adsorption and light transmission waveguide for evanescent wave production. According to the change of evanescent wave intensity and followed by Beer's law, the methylene blue (MB) adsorption behavior can be real-time monitored at the silica-water interface. Langmuir adsorption model and pseudo-first-order model are applied to obtain the related thermodynamic and kinetic data. The adsorption equilibrium constant ( K) and adsorption free energy (\u0394 G) of MB at the silica-water interface are determined to be (3.3 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 M and -25.7 \u00b1 1.7 kJ mol. Meanwhile, this method is highlighted to isolate elementary processes of adsorption and desorption under steady-state conditions, and gives adsorption rate constant ( k) and desorption rate constant ( k) of 8585 \u00b1 19.8 min and 0.26 \u00b1 0.0006 min for 15 r/min flow rate. The surface interaction process is revealed and adsorption mechanism is proposed, indicating MB first adsorbed on Si-O sites through electrostatic attraction and then on Si-OH sites through hydrogen bond with increasing MB concentrations. Our findings from this study provided molecular-level interpretation of azo dye adsorption at silica-water interface, and the results provide important insight into how MB adsorption can be controlled at the interface.",

The sensor was designed by using light emitting diode (LED) as light source and optical fiber as light transmission element.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Chlorine is a powerful oxidizing agent extensively used in water disinfection and blanching processes. Too low or too high chlorine concentration in water supplies would cause hazards for water usage. In this work, a miniaturized microfluidic evanescent-wave sensor was developed for colorimetric determination of free chlorine in water. A microfluidic channel with narrow  d  c  (50\u00a0\u03bcm) was constructed to act as both flow cell and detection cell in this sensor. When light propagated by total internal reflection (TIR) in the fiber core, evanescent wave produced on the fiber surface could interact with the DPD reagents and produce absorption change. The free chlorine could be determinated by colorimetric method and evaluated by absobance according to Beer\u2019s law. This miniaturized sensor showed improved performances of small detection volume (1.2\u00a0\u03bcL), fast analysis (4.42\u00a0s), low detection limit (1.5\u00a0ppb) and excellent repeatability (1.59%) for chlorine determination. The sensor was applied to chlorine determination in different water samples. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by conventional spectrophotometry and iodometry, showing agreement and validating the sensor\u2019s potential applications.

        "abstract": "Oxidative damage to telomeres leads to telomere attrition and genomic instability, resulting in poor cell viability. Telomere dynamics contribute to the maintenance of telomere integrity; however, whether oxidative damage induces telomere movement and how telomere mobility is regulated remain poorly understood. Here, we show that oxidative damage at telomeres triggers directional telomere movement. The presence of the human Sir2 homolog, Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is required for oxidative damage-induced telomeric movement. SIRT6 knock out (KO) cells show neither damage-induced telomere movement nor chromatin decondensation at damaged telomeres; both are observed in wild type (WT) cells. A deacetylation mutant of SIRT6 increases damage-induced telomeric movement in SIRT6 KO cells as well as WT SIRT6. SIRT6 recruits the chromatin-remodeling protein SNF2H to damaged telomeres, which appears to promote chromatin decondensation independent of its deacetylase activity. Together, our results suggest that SIRT6 plays a role in the regulation of telomere movement upon oxidative damage, shedding new light onto the function of SIRT6 in telomere maintenance.",

        "abstract": "Actively transcribed regions of the genome are protected by transcription-coupled DNA repair mechanisms, including transcription-coupled homologous recombination (TC-HR). Here we used reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce and characterize TC-HR at a transcribed locus in human cells. As canonical HR, TC-HR requires RAD51. However, the localization of RAD51 to damage sites during TC-HR does not require BRCA1 and BRCA2, but relies on RAD52 and Cockayne Syndrome Protein B (CSB). During TC-HR, RAD52 is recruited by CSB through an acidic domain. CSB in turn is recruited by R loops, which are strongly induced by ROS in transcribed regions. Notably, CSB displays a strong affinity for DNA:RNA hybrids in vitro, suggesting that it is a sensor of ROS-induced R loops. Thus, TC-HR is triggered by R loops, initiated by CSB, and carried out by the CSB-RAD52-RAD51 axis, establishing a BRCA1/2-independent alternative HR pathway protecting the transcribed genome.",

        "abstract": "Numerous DNA repair and signaling proteins function at DNA damage sites to protect the genome. Here, we show that fusion of the promiscuous biotin ligase BirA with RAD18 leads to localized protein biotinylation at DNA damage sites, allowing identification of ZPET (zinc finger protein proximal to RAD eighteen)/ZNF280C as a potential DNA damage response (DDR) protein. ZPET binds ssDNA and localizes to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and stalled replication forks. In vitro, ZPET inhibits MRE11 binding to ssDNA. In cells, ZPET delays MRE11 binding to chromatin after DSB formation and slows DNA end resection through binding ssDNA. ZPET hinders resection independently of 53BP1 and HELB. Cells lacking ZPET displayed enhanced homologous recombination (HR), accelerated replication forks under stress, and increased resistance to DSBs and PARP inhibition. These results not only reveal ZPET as an HR repressor but also suggest that localized protein biotinylation at DNA damage sites is a useful strategy to identify DDR proteins.",

Therefor, taking clear digital pictures is an urgent need to be solved right now. However, the movement or instability of lens will cause the picture faint blur, which greatly reduces the user experience. The current solutions are to put the virtual dummy photo in the computer of a higher configuration for processing. This process seriously affected the timeliness and universality of information dissemination. In this paper, we proposed portable deblurring system for mobile terminal of fuzzy pictures based on two classic image restoration algorithm of Wiener filter and blind restoration. Proposed mobile deblurring system adaptively evaluates the degree of picture blurs, and the point diffusion function is resolved by the existing fuzzy picture feature. At the same time, the optimization of the ambiguity is made to ensure the lightweight and low latency of the Mobile-Deblur algorithm. Finally, the validity and superiority in the MobileDeblur System is proved by simulation and real environment experiment respectively in the picture to deblur on the mobile phone.",

Herein, a novel electrochemical sensor was developed by immobilizing a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid nanocomposite which consisted of one-dimensional (1D) multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and two-dimensional (2D) g-C 3 N 4  nanosheets on a glassy carbon electrode (g-C 3 N 4 /MWNTs/GCE). The g-C 3 N 4 /MWNTs/GCE exhibited excellent response toward the oxidation reactions of dopamine (DA), uric acid (UA) and tryptophan (Trp). Under the optimum conditions, the electrochemical sensor was used in the detection of DA, UA and Trp, and achieved wide ranges of 2.0\u201343.5\u00a0\u03bcM, 5.0\u2013189.0\u00a0\u03bcM and 65.0\u20131815.0\u00a0\u03bcM with low detection limits (S/N\u00a0=\u00a03) of 5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u2212\u00a08 \u00a0M, 5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u2212\u00a07 \u00a0M and 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u2212\u00a06 \u00a0M, respectively. In addition, the coexistence of ascorbic acid (AA) has no obvious interference toward the detection of DA, UA and Trp.

        "abstract": "The gradient preconditioning approach based on seismic wave energy can effectively avoid the huge memory consumption of the gradient preconditioning algorithms based on the Hessian matrix. However, the accuracy of this approach is prone to be influenced by the energy of reflected waves. To tackle this problem, the paper proposes a new gradient preconditioning method based on the energy of transmitted waves. The approach scales the gradient through a precondition factor, which is calculated by the \u2018approximate transmission wavefield\u2019 simulation based on the nonreflecting acoustic wave equation. The method requires no computing nor storing of the Hessian matrix and its inverse matrix. Furthermore, the proposed method can effectively eliminate the effects of geometric spreading and disproportionality in the gradient illumination. The results of model experiments show that the time-domain full waveform inversion (FWI) using the gradient preconditioning based on transmitted wave energy can achieve higher inversion accuracy for deep high-velocity bodies and their underlying strata in comparison with the one using the gradient preconditioning based on seismic wave energy. The field marine seismic data test shows that our proposed method is also highly applicable to the FWI of field marine seismic data.",

This paper focuses on the spatial distribution of long-term grassland fire patterns in the Hulun Buir Grassland located in the northeast of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in China. The density or ratio of ignition can reflect the relationship between grassland fire and different ignition factors. Based on the relationship between the density or ratio of ignition in different range of each ignition factor and grassland fire events, an ignition probability model was developed by using binary logistic regression function and its overall accuracy averaged up to 81.7%. Meanwhile it was found that daily relative humidity, daily temperature, elevation, vegetation type, distance to county-level road, distance to town are more important determinants of spatial distribution of fire ignitions. Using Monte Carlo method, we developed a time-dependent stochastic ignition probability model based on the distribution of inter-annual daily relative humidity and daily temperature. Through this model, it is possible to estimate the spatial patterns of ignition probability for grassland fire, which will be helpful to the quantitative evaluation of grassland fire risk and its management in the future.",

        "abstract": "Storm surges account for increasing economic losses and casualties (including death and missing) because of sea-level rise and growing population in coastal areas. China is one of the several countries severely affected by storm surge disasters. In this study, the annual variation and geographical distribution of direct economic losses and casualties caused by storm surge in coastal areas of China were analyzed based on the losses database. The results show that: (1) the frequency of the tropical storm surges over the past 65\u00a0years has risen remarkably with a significant trend, while the frequency of extra-tropical storm surges does not display this trend; (2) the annual casualties caused by storm surge have decreased, with Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces suffering the highest casualties from storm surge; and (3) the annual direct economic losses present no obvious trend, with Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian experiencing the highest direct economic losses from storm surge. Taking GDP and the gross ocean production into consideration,\n their loss rates show an obvious decreasing trend over the past 25\u00a0years. Although population and exposed value have increased rapidly in coastal areas, the casualties and economic loss rate show a decreasing trend, suggesting that disaster reduction measures by the Chinese government have had a significant effect in storm surge disaster prevention.",

Numerical simulation results showed that these factors above had different level effecting on the present conditions of the pipelines, the horizontal distance and vertical distance between the pipeline and the tunnel are the most influential factors, we must avoid the subway and pipeline parallel during the construction because the pipelines displacement will be very large, the impact the underground water table can not be neglected. 10 meters horizontal distance and 10 meters vertical distance near the concrete pipeline should not allowed doing the construction, that would result in grave consequences of the pipelines. \u00a9 ASCE 2013.",

Respectively, 96.5% and 96.4% of human and mouse SNPs located in the middle of imperfect microsatellites come from single nucleotide mutations happened in perfect microsatellites. On chromosome 1, there are more transversions in mouse mononucleotide repeats MNRs, but similar mutation patterns in human and mouse dinucleotide repeats DNRs and trinucleotide repeats TNRs. Different single nucleotide mutation patterns in different microsatellites of human and mouse hint these mutations are under different natural selections. Our method can help to detect mutation patterns of different genomes without homogenous sequence alignments, and to observe the conserved mutations in microsatellites which cannot be found by traditional SNP methods.",

The biceps, brachialis, and triceps were attached to pneumatic actuators loaded to mimic muscle force. The radiocapitellar contact pressure and area were measured in real time, and the associated curves were depicted simultaneously. No significant differences in the contact area or associated curves were found between native radial head and the anatomic radial head prosthesis. The contact pressure and associated curve for the anatomic radial head prosthesis were better than those for the non-anatomic radial head prosthesis. We conclude from this study that the contact pressure and area of the elbow with anatomic radial head prosthesis are similar to those of the native radial head. The anatomic radial head prosthesis appears to be more suitable in clinical use.",

The longitudinal settlement of shield tunnel has significant effect on the safety of the subway operation. In this paper, the deformation of the shield tunnel and the surrounding soil were analyzed by the establishment of a three-dimensional model. The vertical displacements of four paths (Path 1 is on the ground; Path 2 is at the top of the tunnel; Path 3 is in the middle of the tunnel; Path 4 is at the bottom of the tunnel) are affected by the nature of the soil. The horizontal displacement is smaller than the vertical displacement and horizontal displacement of the clay is larger than that of the sand. The distribution of the pore pressure changes with soil properties around the tunnel. The pore pressure of the sand layer is larger than that of the clay layer at the same depth of underlying soil.",

        "abstract": "Rice is the third largest cultivated cereal crop in the world, making rice hulls one of the most abundant biowastes on Earth. In this manuscript, the rice husks have been subjected to alkali treatment at low temperatures aiming to produce a lignocellulosic sorbent material as well as removing their\u00a0silica. This absorbent has been subsequently tested for marine diesel spill clean up. Various treatment conditions such as NaOH concentration, duration, and temperature have been investigated. The optimized cellulosic sorbents show high RMG380 marine diesel uptake due to low bulk density and their fluffy structure. It is argued that the bulk density is a critical factor in the excellent uptake capacity. As far as the authors are aware, these results (as high as 20\u00a0g of RMG380 sorbed per gram of sobent) show the highest oil sorption for rice husk derived materials reported in literature. Other advantages include higher yields and lower treatment temperatures compared to other studies. The proposed cheap and environmentally friendly method provides a simple and safe technique for the production of valuable products from lignocellulosic agricultural waste.",

However, they suffer from intrinsic brittleness and it is very difficult to obtain materials with both high thermoelectric ability and good flexibility. Here, we report a flexible thermoelectric material comprising highly ordered BiTe nanocrystals anchored on a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) network, where a crystallographic relationship exists between the BiTe <[Formula: see text]> orientation and SWCNT bundle axis. This material has a power factor of ~1,600\u2009\u03bcW\u2009m\u2009K at room temperature, decreasing to 1,100\u2009\u03bcW\u2009m\u2009K at 473\u2009K. With a low in-plane lattice thermal conductivity of 0.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 W\u2009m\u2009K, a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.89 at room temperature is achieved, originating from a strong phonon scattering effect. The origin of the excellent flexibility and thermoelectric performance of the BiTe-SWCNT material is attributed, by experimental and computational evidence, to its crystal orientation, interface and nanopore structure. Our results provide insight into the design and fabrication of high-performance flexible thermoelectric materials.",

        "abstract": "Inorganic chalcogenides are traditional high-performance thermoelectric materials. However, they suffer from intrinsic brittleness and it is very difficult to obtain materials with both high thermoelectric ability and good flexibility. Here, we report a flexible thermoelectric material comprising highly ordered Bi 2 Te 3 nanocrystals anchored on a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) network, where a crystallographic relationship exists between the Bi 2 Te 3 &lt;1\u00af21\u00af0&gt; orientation and SWCNT bundle axis. This material has a power factor of ~1,600 \u03bcW m \u22121 K \u22122 at room temperature, decreasing to 1,100 \u03bcW m \u22121 K \u22122 at 473 K. With a low in-plane lattice thermal conductivity of 0.26 \u00b1 0.03 W m \u22121 K \u22121 , a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.89 at room temperature is achieved, originating from a strong phonon scattering effect. The origin of the excellent flexibility and thermoelectric performance of the Bi 2 Te 3 \u2013SWCNT material is attributed, by experimental and computational evidence, to its crystal orientation, interface and nanopore structure. Our results provide insight into the design and fabrication of high-performance flexible thermoelectric materials. \u00a9 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",

The aim of the present study was to identify genetic signatures in patients with IBDs and elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms underlying IBD subtypes. The gene expression profiles of the GSE75214 datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in UC and CD patients compared with controls using the GEO2R tool. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of DEGs were performed using DAVID. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the DEGs were constructed using Cytoscape software. Subsequently, significant modules were selected and the hub genes were identified. In the GO and KEGG pathway analysis, the top enriched pathways in UC and CD included  infection, rheumatoid arthritis, complement and coagulation cascades, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and osteoclast differentiation. In addition, the GO terms in the category biological process significantly enriched by these genes were inflammatory response, immune response, leukocyte migration, cell adhesion, response to molecules of bacterial origin and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. However, several other biological processes (GO terms) and pathways (e.g., 'chemotaxis', 'collagen catabolic process' and 'ECM-receptor interaction') exhibited significant differences between the two subtypes of IBD. The top 10 hub genes were identified from the PPI network using respective DEGs. Of note, the hub genes G protein subunit gamma 11 (GNG11), G protein subunit beta 4 (GNB4), Angiotensinogen (AGT), Phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3 (PIK3R3) and C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) are disease-specific and may be used as biomarkers for differentiating UC from CD. Furthermore, module analysis further confirmed that common significant pathways involved in the pathogenesis of IBD subtypes were associated with chemokine-induced inflammation, innate immunity, adapted immunity and infectious microbes. In conclusion, the present study identified DEGs, key target genes, functional pathways and enrichment analysis of IBDs, enhancing the understanding of the pathogenesis of IBDs and also advancing the clarification of the underlying molecular mechanisms of UC and CD. Furthermore, these results may provide potential molecular targets and diagnostic biomarkers for UC and CD.",

        "abstract": "Tooth enamel plays a critical role in the function of teeth by providing a hard surface layer to resist wear/impact throughout the lifetime of organisms; however, such enamel exhibits a remarkably low resistance to the initiation of large-scale cracks, of hundreds of micrometers or more, comparable to that of geological minerals. Here we reveal that tooth enamel, specifically that of the giant panda, is capable of partially recovering its geometry and structure to counteract the early stages of damage at nano- to micro-scale dimensions autonomously. Such an attribute results essentially from the architecture of enamel but is markedly enhanced by hydration. Our work discerns a series of mechanisms that lead to the deformation and recovery of enamel and identifies a unique source of durability in the enamel to accomplish this function. The ingenious design of tooth enamel may inspire the development of new durable ceramic materials in man-made systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Core/shell/shell-structured Ni/SiO 2 /polyaniline hexagonal nanoflakes possessing in-plane [111] easy magnetization ( M ) and out-of-plane interfacial polarization ( P ) are synthesized by a three-step liquid chemical method, and their physicochemical properties and growth mechanism are investigated. Three characteristic types of paraffin-bonded ring-shaped nanoflake composites having random (R), vertical\u2013horizontal (V\u2013H), and horizontal\u2013vertical (H\u2013V) orientations of the orthogonal  M  and  P  to their two major surfaces are prepared by randomly, vertically, and horizontally aligning the nanoflakes in the paraffin matrix under a magnetic alignment and thermal curing process. The composites are evaluated experimentally and theoretically in the L\u2013Ku (1\u201318\u202fGHz) bands of microwaves in order to investigate the orientation effect of the orthogonal  M  and  P  on their microwave electromagnetic properties. The in-plane  M  in the H\u2013V-oriented composite and the out-of-plane  P  in the V\u2013H-oriented composite, which are parallel to the effective magnetic and electric field vectors of incident microwaves, result in a significant enhancement in permeability with multiple magnetic natural resonances and an obvious improvement in permittivity in comparison with other composites, respectively. The observations agree with the theoretical predictions based on the Landau\u2013Lifshitz\u2013Gilbert equation and Bruggemanu0027s effective medium theory for permeability and the Debyeu0027s polarization theory for permittivity. As a result, the H\u2013V-oriented composite achieves the best microwave electromagnetic impedance matching and absorption with a broad absorbing bandwidth of 4\u202fGHz, a wide thickness range of 7\u201310\u202fmm, and a minimal reflection loss of \u221241.5\u202fdB in the Ku (12\u201318\u202fGHz) band.",

The desirable band-to-band redshift of the absorption edge of semiconducting binary metal oxides such as prototypical photocatalyst TiO 2 by doping is long targeted but remains a challenge, up to date. Here, by taking the advantage of abundant 1D diffusion channels with rhombus-like cross-sections along the c-axis in the crystal structure of titanium oxalate hydrate to promote the entrance of nitrogen dopant species into the bulk and subsequent thermal topotactic transition in an atmosphere of gaseous ammonia, homogeneous doping of substitutional carbon/nitrogen for oxygen in the TiO 2 decahedral plates with a dominant anatase phase is obtained for the first time. The resultant TiO 2\u2212 x (CN) y with an unusual band-to-band visible light absorption spectrum can induce photocatalytic water oxidation to release oxygen under visible light irradiation. This study provides not only a promising visible light\u2013responsive TiO 2 photocatalyst, but also an important strategy for developing other solar-driven photocatalysts. \u00a9 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
