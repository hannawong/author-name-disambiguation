        "abstract": "Stalagmite has the advantage of high precision dating in paleoclimate reconstruction because of the advance in TIMS-U series dating. However, the measured ages of stalagmite usually don't accord with the nature rule of stalagmite growth, which makes a lot of measured ages can't be used. Taking stalagmite LL1 got in the Lianhua Cave in Longshan, west of Hunan province as an example, this study found that the quantity of 238 U\u3001230Th reduce and measured ages of stalagmite grow young in the process of the change of stalagmite structure, especially the process of wenshi changed into calcite and calcite re-crystallization. What's more, based on the condition that eliminates potential affecting factors such as sample pollution, this study calculated the calibration age of LL1 the on the assumption that the 230 Th/238U lost rate is 1%,10%,50% respectively. The result shows that the rate of lost 230 Th/238U is similar to the rate of reduced age caused by the change of stalagmite structure. In addition, we find that the older the stalagmite, the younger measured ages grow compared with the real ages of stalagmite. Therefore, The study on the method of the correction of TIMS-U series ages helps to establish normal and precise stalagmite chronology.",

        "abstract": "Advances in the research of stalagmites keep pace with the development of dating techniques,because new dating techniques aid paleoclimate reconstruction.Therefore,a precise chronology is the key for paleoclimate reconstruction based on stalagmites.Our study on old stalagmites(>250ka) using the ICP-MS 230 Th dating method shows that stalagmite D6,D7,D9 of the Dongge Cave contain continuous and high resolution paleoclimate since 400ka ago.The 230 Th data serve as a standard for paleoclimate study in southwestern China for the last 500ka.This paper focuses on the relationship between stalagmite growth rate and paleoclimate reconstruction based on 135 precise ICP-MS 230 Th analyses of three big stalagmites in the Dongge Cave in southwestern China.The growth rate of stalagmites is negatively correlated with the \u03b4 18 O record of SPECMAP and positively correlated with summer insolation at 25\u00b0N.Stalagmite growth rate was high in interglacial intervals,low in glacial periods,and more variable in transitional periods.Based on these results,we suggest that stalagmite growth rate may record changes in abrupt cold and warm events and thus could provide a useful proxy for long term records of paleoprecipitation and paleoclimate.",

        "abstract": "The time sequence of high resolution paleoclimatic change since 2 300 a B.P.has been reconstructed by dating ages of the high precision ICPMS or TIMS-U series and the analysis of the carbon and oxygen isotopes from a stalagmite of Dongge cave in the area of Libo,Guizhou.The study showed that the records of the warm and cold events from a stalagmite since 2 300 a B.P.in the area of Libo reflected the paleoclimatic change which can be divided into eight stages:(1) Falling temperature stage from 2 300 a B.P.to 1 800 a B.P.showed that the East Asian summer monsoon became weakly and winter monsoon became strongly,the air temperature gradually fallen,the available rainfall reduced,and they represented the dry and cold climate environment;(2) Rising temperature stage from 1 080 a B.P.indicated that the East Asian winter monsoon slowly weaken 1 800 a B.P.to and summer monsoon slightly strengthened,and they represented the semi-humid and warm-cool climate environment.(3) Dropping temperature time from 1 080 a B.P.to 680a B.P.showed that the winter monsoon strengthened again,the air temperature reduced again,and the available rainfall relatively increased in winter,and they represented the cold and humid climate environment.This stage was the key transition period of climate change.(4) Warm period from 680 a B.P.to 550 a B.P.revealed that the East Asian summer monsoon strengthened again,the air temperature rose,the available rainfall relatively increased in summer,and they represented the warm and humid climate environment.(5) The cold period from 550 a B.P.to 400 a B.P.indicated that the East Asian winter monsoon rapidly strengthened,the air temperature quickly dropped and the available rainfall increased a lot,and they represented the cold and humid climate environment.This stage was the coldest stage in the last 1000 years.(6) Warm-cool period from 400 a B.P.to 364 a B.P.revealed that the East Asian summer monsoon slightly strengthen,the air temperature slightly increased,and they represented the warm-cool and humid climate environment.(7) The cold-cool period from 364 a B.P.to 324 a B.P.indicated that the East Asian winter monsoon slightly strengthen,the air temperature slightly dropped,this period was the cold-cool and humid climate environment.(8) The relatively fluctuation stage of climate change from 324 a B.P.up to the present revealed that the East Asian monsoon frequently changed,the curve of isotope records submitted the serrated undulations,which included some sub-stages of the cold-cool and semi-humid,cold and humid climate changes.Some key centural-scale climate events,for example the dry-cold period,Suitang warm period,little warm and cold period,and some changes of precipitation and temperture in the ten,century time scale has been revealed since 2 300 years in Libo area according to the continuous record of high resolution paleoclimatic change from a stalagmite.The abrupt events of climatic change in the ten,century time scale from a stalagmite record has an analogy with the events of the ice core records,and reflected that the monsoon climate from stalagmite records in the low latitude region is provided a wonderful relativity with the climate change in the high latitude region and the arctic pole.The above study has the important scientific significance for knowing the change of modern climate system,climatic forecast and driving mechanism of climatic evolution in the future.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the factors controlling the \u03b418O composition of the precipitation in Guilin.Daily precipitation samples for stable isotope analysis were collected in Guilin during 2010.The stable isotope(\u03b4D and \u03b418O) in precipitation displayed obvious spatial and temporal variation,and thus could be used for providing:(1)the best natural tracer for studying the hydrological cycle;(2)the ambient temperature and amount at time of precipitation;(3)the ground surface elevation;(4)the distance between precipitation event and its water vapor source region in the ocean;(5)water vapor source migration pathway.Empirical relations between isotope of precipitation and climate were used in numerous studied aimed to reconstructing past climate from various environmental archives.\u03b4D and \u03b418O in atmospheric precipitation were tested and analyzed,and the results showed:the values of \u03b4D distribution ranged from 29.05\u2030 to 96.27\u2030;\u03b418O values distribution ranged from-0.2\u2030 to-12.96\u2030.The tested result of stable isotope showed significantly seasonal variability.The research results indicated that there was a significant relationship between \u03b418O values and the types of monsoon winds.\u03b418O values of the researched area were mainly affected by summer monsoon of east and southeast area in summer.During the transportation of atmospheric precipitation,the \u03b4D and \u03b418O in vapor caused by intense precipitation became more negative.Thus,\u03b4D and \u03b418O values of precipitation in summer were more negative excursion than that in winter.The Local Meteoric Water Line:\u03b4D=8.87\u03b418O+15.49 was established by using the relationship between \u03b4D and \u03b418O.This result reflected climate character of Guilin:the warm and rainy.In addition,Deuterium Excess(d=\u03b4D-8\u03b418O)presented different characters during summer and winter.At the same time,the equation showed that in the researched area,the vapor source of atmospheric precipitation were mainly from ocean of low latitude in summer,while in winter the vapor source of atmospheric precipitation were mainly from the evaparation of inland and part areas and the transportation of winter monsoon(westerlies).In 2010,the \u03b418O value of atmospheric precipitation in September was more negative than that in June.This result indicated summer monsoon was extremely strong in September.But the total precipitation in September was far less than that in June.The reason might be that summer wind was strong and caused atmospheric precipitation zone reached to monsoon marginal zone.All of this contributed to the relatively decrease of atmospheric precipitation in the researched area.This study provides significant information to understand present-day seasonality of precipitation and its isotopic composition in Guilin,and strong scientific basis for constructing environment temperature with the use of stalagmites and dripping water.",

        "abstract": "Environmental factors affecting speleothem formation-modern carbonate deposits such as air and water temperature as well as water properties at the surface and in the cave(pH,electrical conductivity,Ca2+,HCO-3 ion concentrations and dripping rates) were measured during two years in order to reveal seasonal variations.Our monitoring at 8 sites of dripping water during the two hydrologic years in the Panlong cave of Guilin indicated that cave drip water originated mainly from meteoric precipitation and soil water,and is controlled by interactions between water,soil and carbonate rock.Cave drip water was of quick response to meteoric precipitation with features of seasonal variation.The physical and chemical characteristics of cave drip water are affected by the meteoric precipitation,the bedrock thickness of the cave roof above the cave,residence time of seepage water and fast-or slow-drip water rate.The temperature variation of cave drip waters was very constant from 19.4\u2103 to 21.2\u2103 during the two years which is very close to the mean surface temperature(19.4\uff5e19.8\u2103).The pH values of cave drip waters vary between 7.1 and 8.3.The average pH values at all drip water sites in this monitor are 7.85.The electrical conductivity,Ca2+ and HCO-3 ion concentrations show a positive correlation with air temperature,drip water temperature and drip rates.In summer,meteoric precipitation is more or large,i.e.,the larger the soil humidity,the higher the partial CO2(PCO2) in soil water,the more the dissolved CaCO3,the stronger the karstification under the epikarst zone of percolation water.The electrical conductivity and Ca2+ and HCO-3 ion concentrations in cave drip water tend to increase,and the modern carbonate deposits also increase.On the contrary,in winter season,meteoric precipitation is little or small,the smaller the soil humidity,the lower the partial CO2(PCO2) in soil water,the less the dissolved CaCO3,the weaker the karstification under the epikarst zone of percolation water.The electrical conductivity and Ca2+ and HCO-3 ion concentrations in cave drip water tend to reduce,and the modern carbonate deposits also tend to reduce.It is seen that this is a processes from meteoric precipitation to soil water to cave drip water again.The secondary chemical carbonate deposits formed by cave drip water can record the information about karst environmental changes,which is very important information for studying the past environment variation recorded in karst areas.",

The cave was vertically developed in dolomitite and dolomitized limestone and controlled by a fracture zone in the Baojing-Fuxing area. The formation of the cave is closely related to the special geological tectonic environment. Authors discussed the cave sediments-speleothem in particular and its relativity on the base of cave formation characteristics. The cave has all types of cave sediments including debris sediments and sub-chemical deposits and formed upper, middle and lower three different deposit platforms. These platforms and its accompanying deposits display characteristics of cave shape, deposits and its sediment processes. The study has completed the origin classification for sub-chemical deposits and suggests that the wall flowstones, stalactite, stalagmites and stalacto-stalagmites accumulated together could form scenery spots with great importance in tourism. The No. 1 stalagmite with perfect deposit cycle, texture and structure characteristics indicates that the deposit of the glacial stage during 30-10ka BP. On the basis of synthetic study about the cave and its sediments, and combined with the Tertiary and Cretaceous sediments and the relationship between the accompanying deposits, it is concluded that the Yaoba cave was formed during the Cretaceous period.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the relationship between the openness of systems and erroneous U-series ages based on 82 precise ICP-MS 230Th dating measurements of two big stalagmites LL1 (aragonite-calcite stalagmite) and LL5 (aragonite stalagmite) from Lianhua Cave,Longshan County,Hunan Province,China. The concordant changes of 234U/238U vs. 230Th /238U,lithology characteristics and 230Th ages in the stalagmites,suggest that aragonite minerals of stalagmite LL1 in Lianhua Cave kept close system during U/Th isotopes decay and provide credible 230Th ages during the Holocene. From 10 ka to 40 ka,U and Th isotopic system of the stalagmite LL1 was in alterations of open/close system,leading to occurrence of unexpected ages. Stalagmite LL5 essentially kept close system from 60 ka to 80 ka,resulting in 230Th ages in order of stratigraphic sequence. A conclusion can be drawn that the openness of U/Th isotopic systems in aragonite stalagmites in one cave do not always increase as age increases. Many complicated factors,such as cave hydrologic conditions,geochemical property of solutes and diagenesis after its formation,may contribute to the erroneous U-series ages. Our preliminary study on U and Th isotopic system provides great potential for calibrating erroneous U-series ages in aragonite-calcite stalagmites and thus establishing a correct age-growth length model.",

Method Dominant plants including Vitex negundo and Loropetalum chinense and soil were sampled regularly to detect organic carbon content and \u03b413C value. Result The \u03b413C value of soil organic carbon obviously changed in different seasons with the range of -27.50\u2030 to-17.92\u2030. The average \u03b413C value range in each organ of Vitex negundo and Loropetalum chinense was 28.23\u2030 to -25.15\u2030. The \u03b413C value of soil organic carbon ranged from-22.32\u2030 to -19.00\u2030 . The sequence of soil organic carbon content was karst depression bushes>karst slop bushes>karst depression irrigation grass,and surface soil(0-5cm)> deeper soil(10-20 cm). Conclusion The amplitude change of soil organic carbon \u03b413C was larger,but the change rule of slope,depression and grassland was inconsistent. From surface to the downward,the soil \u03b413C value decreased with the increase of soil depth on the whole,indicating that the \u03b413C value of soil organic carbon was obviously higher than that of local plants.",

        "abstract": "Research on climatic changes in the Holocene plays an important role in paleoclimatology.At present,the research of climatic change in Holocene is using various geological records or proxies.The time sequence of paleo-climatic change in Ninglang area between 4 500 aBP and 2 000 aBP has been reconstructed by \u03b1-U series dates and analysis of the oxygen isotopes from a stalagmite in Xianren cave in Ninglang,Yunnan.Our study results have shown that the paleoclimatic environment change can be divided into six stages:\u2460warm and dry climate environment from 4 500 aBP to 4 000 aBP;\u2461cold and dry climate environment from 4 000 aBP to 3 400 aBP,which is an abrupt change in the climatic evolution of middle Holocene;\u2462the warm and humid climate environment from 3 400 aBP to 3 100 aBP;\u2463cold and dry climate environment from 3 100 aBP to 2 650 aBP;\u2464warm and humid climate environment from 2 650 aBP to 2 400 aBP;\u2465cold to cool and humid climate environment from 2 400 aBP to 2 000 aBP.The monsoon change from the stalagmite record on the short time scale since the late time of middle Holocene is obviously affected by the strength of the solar radiation in the middle and low latitude regions and air circumfluence in Northern Hemisphere.The main driving mechanism of Indian monsoon evolution is controlled by change of the solar radiation.Stalagmite record revealed that Indian summer monsoon moved forward rapidly,and climate undulation on a century scale resulted in the change of the solar radiation.",

The Shuijinggong cave is formed in Maokou formation(P1 m)of the Lower Permian system,the cave is developed along the bedded structure of limestone and near NS trending fault.The height of the cave entrance is 650m above sea level and the covering layer on the top of cave is about 100m to 200mthick.The total length of cave measures 800m,the width of cave is 4-40m,and the height of cave tunnel is 1.5-35 m.Cave temperature is 18.5\u2103to 19.6\u2103,humidity 95%.This condition is suitable for the formation of the cave sediments and landscape protection.The Shuijinggong cave is a newly developed cave with good enclosed conditions and better humidity,there is still a large number of recent carbonate sediments developing in the cave.The landscapes of secondary chemical sediment in the cave is very rich including stalactite,stone curtain,stone waterfall,stalagmites,stone column and stone shield and so on.Furthermore,there are the rarest landscapes of cave sediments at home and abroad,such as the soda straw,helictite and cave flower, which are still growing nowadays on the top of cave.The research also aims to make clear the environmental significance of carbon and oxygen isotope records from sedimentary of modern speleothems.The research results have shown that cave sediments in the Shuijinggong cave began to deposit in the late Tertiary period according to sediment character,composition,sedimentary sequence dating,and its sedimentary was mainly travertine gravel.The main formation period of cave landscapes in the Shuijinggong cave with magnificence and grand landscape characters is the Early Pleistocene and the Middle Pleistocene periods.These speleothems in the Shuijinggong cave,determined by 230 Th-U dating age,are formed 1 000ka BP,520-600ka BP and 350-400ka BP,respectively.Climate at the early stage of the Late Pleistocene or the last interglacial period during 125-90ka BP mainly is warm and humid,and only a small number of stalagmites in cave formed and rarely saved.The sudden change of climatic environment occurred after 90ka BP is more unsuitable for sediment formation and preservation in cave.The present speleothems,composed of 50-150cm high,pure white stalagmites and stalactites with exquisitely carved,sculpt fancy,rare cave landscapes,are mainly formed 40ka BP,7 500aBP and 1 450aBP respectively,according to 230 Th-U dating.The cave sediment landscapes formed since the late stages of the late Pleistocene do not only provide abundant tourism resources and value for the Shuijingong cave,but also provides important information for paleo-climate reconstruction in Guangxi.",

The radial symmetry structure of aragonite is clearly shown. The environment of aragonite stalagmite formation is characterized by cool temperatures and humid conditions with abundant and steady drop water. An additional requirement is that water temperature must be lower than air temperature. The acicular and columnar shapes of aragonite crystals are preserved even after aragonite changes into calcite. The change of aragonite to calcite usually occurs under lower temperature and pressure. This change is controlled by the cave environment, the character of drop water's run on the stalagmite and the water content of the stalagmite. This change does not disturb isotopic fractionation, and during the process the stalagmite is able to keep environment information. The study of aragonite stalagmites is important to reconstruct the paleoclimate and know mineralization in both theory and practice.",

        "abstract": "The trend monitoring of cave dripping water and modern carbonate deposits at 13 monitoring points of dripping water in Panlong Cave of Guilin during the pre-phase (1995~2000) and nearly two hydrological years reveal that there exist two types of modern carbonate (CaCO3) deposits: the first is the modern carbonate (CaCO3) deposit of the perennial dripping water in the cave whose\u03b413C values have recorded climate change characteristics of the whole year, and the second is the modern carbonate (CaCO3) deposit of the seasonal dripping water in the cave with the seasonal change characteristics of\u03b413C values. The monitoring and isotope analysis of modern carbonate (CaCO3) deposits show that the exterior mountain peaks of the Panlong cave in Guilin are mainly C3 plants (with almost no C4 plants), and the\u03b413C records of modern carbonate (CaCO3) indicate that the summer monsoon is strong, the rainwater is relatively rich, the biologic activities are strong, and the modern carbonate deposits are fairly well developed in the half year of summer, and the average\u03b413C value is -13.13\u2030 in the half year of summer. The\u03b413C values of the modern carbonate (CaCO3) deposits are somewhat negative, with the an-nual average\u03b413C value being -12.23\u2030 and the maximum negative value being -14.5\u2030 for the whole year. The \u03b413C values of the modern carbonate (CaCO3) deposits are somewhat positive (-10\u2030~-11\u2030) due to less rainwater in the half year of winter. In addition, the\u03b413C values of modern carbonate (CaCO3) formed by dripping water with a lag of one month or half a month show a sudden negative trend and mainly reflect the influence of the CO2 effect, which results in the effect of meteoric precipitation when heavy rain falls or rainstorm occurs no matter whether in the half year of summer or in the half year of winter.",

        "abstract": "In order to understand the occurrence degree of karstification under different soil CO2concentration and soil water chemistry, the soil CO2concentration, water content and erosion rate of limestone were monitored in the area of Guilin, Guangxi Province.The results showed that: 1) The soil CO2concentration had seasonal variation obviously with a trend of that the highest in summer and the lowest in winter, the soil CO2concentration in summer was 3~5 times as many as those in other seasons on the whole, the maximum was 60 899.64 mg/m2,while the minimum only 5 587.21 mg/m2; 2) The CO2concentration in the soil of depression was higher than that in the soil of slope at the layers of the same depth, the former was nearly 20 000 mg/m2more than that of the latter in summer, and the concentration was higher at deep layer than that at surface, and the mean value was 4 353.54mg/m2more than the concentration at surface; 3) The average values of soil water chemistry in the soil of slope and depression were as follows: pH 7.49 and 6.41, conductivity 300 \u03bcS/cm and 78 \u03bcS/cm, Ca2+60 mg/L and 15.43mg/L,3HCO 2.78 mg/L and 0.44 mg/L, respectively; the pH value, conductivity, Ca2+and3HCO in soil water of slope were all higher than those of the depression; 4) Corrosion test indicated that the Karstification was very obvious in the study area, and was closely related to soil CO2and soil water. So it is concluded that the karstification was driven by soil CO2and soil water.",

        "abstract": "The past environmental information recorded in speleothems has become the focus of short-term and high resolution study of the global changes.Dripping water in cave,as the medium of stalagmite formation,is a proxy responding to rapid change of climatic environment.The changes in composition,drop rate,and amount of the dripping water directly influence the growth rate of stalagmites and to certain extent the environmental information included in it.It is the bridge between the environmental change in the earth's surface and the growth of stalagmites in cave.In this regard,the study of dripping water in cave has become a popular subject for the study of forming mechanism of stalagmites and paleo-climatic reconstruction.Our monitoring of the growth rate of modern carbonate(CaCO3)-stalagmite during two hydrologic years in the Panlong cave of Guilin has revealed that the main period for modern carbonate(CaCO3) precipitation is in the summer season from April to October,the monthly average deposits at a single dripping site changes from 0.7 g to 1.5 g,but the highest value could reach 3.086 g at a single dripping site and the daily mean depositional amount is as high as 0.103 g(or 103 mg) in rainy season.The smallest monthly mean depositional amount at a single dripping site occurs in dry season or winter season.It is about 0.3038g,or about 1/10 of the figure in rainy season.There is even no deposition in dry season or winter season in two dripping sites.Data show that the growth rate of carbonate(CaCO3) has seasonal and Inter-annual changes.The growth rate of modern carbonate(CaCO3) is closely related with monsoon precipitation in summer season,total biologic activities,change in CO2 concentrations in air in the cave.Therefore,to monitor the chemical process of modern carbonate(CaCO3) in cave and its response to environmental changes are critical for the study of global changes.",

The initial 234U/238U ratios in stalagmites have a parallel relation to \u03b418O records of SPECMAP and keep a negative relation to summer insolation for 25\u00b0N in long term records. The (234U/238U)0 in stalagmites fluctuated slowly during interglacial periods and intensively in glacial periods; during transitional stage between glacial and interglacial, the (234U/238U)0in stalagmites shifted sharply. The (234U/238U)0 in stalagmites records BA warm events and YD chill events from the Last Glacial to Holocene, which is consistent with the long term (234U/238U)0 records, with heavier ratioes of stalagmites during chilling events and lighter ratioes of stalagmites during warm events. Initial 234U/238U ratios of stalagmites formed in a closed cave system are similar to \u03b418O values of the cave stalagmites from the same area, in contrast, the both in the southwestern regions of China display weak negative relationship with summer monsoon changes. (234U/238U)0 in stalagmites may be used as a useful proxy for long-term records of paleoprecipitation.",

This study investigates the relationship between oxygen isotope composition of the atmospheric in precipitation and cave drip water at Panlong cave in southwest China on seasonal timescales of variability. Time series seasonal variability was derived from Panlong cave in Guilin by collecting daily precipitation samples for stable isotope analysis during 2012. Results indicate that \u03b418O of precipitation contains a clear seasonal variation whereby higher values are mainly distributed during winter and lower values during summer. Seasonal variations in water sources affect the precipitation \u03b418O values. Drip water \u03b418O also displayed a seasonal cycle which is attenuated relative to \u03b418O of precipitation. Drip water time series display seasonal cycle ranges from 1.5 to 3.5\u00a0\u2030 relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water, which mainly follow the precipitation \u03b418O seasonal cycle. Seasonal variation in drip water \u03b418O supports interpretations of the stalagmite \u03b418O record as a paleoclimate proxy sensitive to the local environment. This monitoring experiment revealed that drip water must be transported through the epikarst in approximately 1.5\u00a0months during cold periods, and <0.5\u00a0months during warm periods. Different residence time percolation is mainly affected by the atmospheric precipitation amount, depending on whether soil moisture reaches saturation.",

This paper describes results of isotopic analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in Panlong Cave water (from drips and shallow pools). Cave water was sampled monthly throughout 2012 and analyzed for \u03b413CDIC composition. The values of \u03b413CDIC in drip water were in the range of \u221210.42 to \u221216.07\u00a0\u2030, while the values of \u03b413CDIC in pool water were in the range of \u22121.88 to \u22126.94\u00a0\u2030. Dissolved inorganic carbon isotope records showed a gradual stepwise negative excursion from January to August, and a gradual stepwise positive excursion from September to December. \u03b413CDIC in cave water showed remarkable seasonal variations, which were negative excursion from 2 to 5\u00a0\u2030 in rainy season than in dry season. A negative \u03b413CDIC excursion in summer was not the result of vegetation types, which was contributed to enhance root respiration and decomposition of soil organic matter. A correlation between \u03b413CDIC values of perennial drip water and pool water samples with air temperature and precipitation amount suggests that these negative excursions were caused by increasing air temperature during rainy season. Negative excursions in \u03b413CDIC values of seasonal drip water were correlated with monthly precipitation, caused by the influx of soil organic matter into the cave. Hence, this paper provides an important framework and an empirical basis for reconstructing temperature from stalagmites and drip water in this region.",

        "abstract": "The mid-Holocene dynamics of the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and Indian Monsoon (IM) are important for understanding the Holocene climate system. To clarify the relationship between EAM and IM subsystems during the mid-Holocene, a 2085-year (6,270\u20134,185 a BP) high-resolution record from stalagmite (FL4) in Yunnan, China was reconstructed using ICP-MS-230Th series dating and carbon and oxygen isotope analysis (\u03b413C and \u03b418O). In the study period, successive positive \u03b418O trends revealed a generally weakening Asian monsoon, with the monsoon climate tending toward gradual drying, especially during three centennial-scale drought events in 6,270\u20136,126 a BP, 5,347\u20135,140 a BP, and 4,810\u20134,620 a BP. On the other hand, the uninterrupted negative trend in \u03b413C signified natural improvements in vegetation overlying the cave, and a serious deficit (~2.5\u00a0\u2030) in \u03b413C during 5,519\u20135,345 a BP implied a heavy rainfall event, in precise phase with \u03b418O, demonstrating an enhanced Indian Monsoon subsystem. The dense sawtooth-shaped pattern of the carbon and oxygen isotope records indicates that a series of decadal-scale abrupt climate changes were superimposed on the centennial-scale monsoon climate changes. FL4 stalagmite records in the mid-Holocene reflect a gradually weakening monsoon climate with superimposed decadal\u2013centennial events, but natural improvements in local vegetation through self-adjustment.",

        "abstract": "To study the effects of extreme precipitation events on drip water in Liangfeng Cave, hydrochemistry and stable isotope compositions of drip water and pool water samples, as well as contemporaneous precipitation samples were measured. Results show that cave temperature had marked diurnal variations, with similar trends to atmospheric temperature on season timescales. However, the amplitude of cave temperature variation was less than atmospheric temperature, related to \u201cbuffering effects\u201d inside the cave. Drip water and pool water ionic concentrations of Ca2+, ({text{HCO}}_{3}^{ - }), and specific conductivity increased after extreme precipitation events, while values of \u03b4D, \u03b418O and \u03b413CDIC in drip water and pool water became more negative. However, samples from sites LF-9 and LF9-1 showed a longer delay to these effects, related to their longer flow paths. The \u03b4D and \u03b418O composition of precipitation mainly controlled the isotope values in drip water, because this mainly depends on water vapor source. However, the \u03b413CDIC of drip water and pool water negative excursions were likely caused by massive amounts of soil CO2 dissolved by percolating precipitation. Thus, hydrochemistry and stable isotope signals in cave drip and pool water appear to mainly reflect precipitation information during extreme precipitation events. Although at different drip sites (e.g., LF-9 and LF9-1), variable hydro-geochemical processes produce different timing and duration to changes in hydrochemistry and stable isotope signals.",

Methods Four siRNAs(mdr1si326,mdr1si1513,mdr1si2631 and mdr1si3071)specifically targeting mdr1 gene were designed and synthesized by in vitro transcription. The silencing efficacy of the four siRNAs was evaluated with RT-PCR for mdr1 mRNA expression, immunoblotting for P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1) expression, flowcytometry for adriamycin (ADR) accumulation and MTT for sensitivity to ADR after transfection into SGC7901/VCR cells with respective siRNAs. The molecular biology software was used to analyze the influence factors on siRNA efficacy. Results The targeting sequences of mdr1si326 with best and mdr1si2631 with better efficiency encoded the cross membrane region of P-gp and had no any stalk or loop, while those of mdr1si3071 with lower and mdr1si1513 with lowest efficacy encoded intracellular region of P-gp and the former had stalk and loop in itself. Besides, the targeting sequences of mdr1si326 with best and mdr1si2631 with better efficiency had less numbers of base matched pairs or hydrogen bonds in the targeting sites and surrounding sites. There was no correlation between the gene silencing and the A/U number at the 3\u2019or 5\u2019end of siRNA, neither N_ 1/N_ 19 or the number of G/C.

There was no significant correlation between the telomere shortening in gastric carcinoma tissue and gender of patient, tumor size, pathological grades, invasion depth, and lymph node metastasis (P>0.05).Conclusion: Telomere erosion occurs in the early stage of gastric carcinogenesis. Telomere shortening may not be used as a sensitive biomarker to judge the malignance of gastric carcinoma.",

METHODS: According to the gene sequence of somatostatin in GenBank, we designed the siRNA-targeted templates and synthesized siRNA using 17 RiboMAX Express RNAi System in vitro. The obtained siRNA was then transfected into gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901.Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) and immunohistochemical techniques were used to detect the expression of somatostatin at both mRNA and protein levels. RESULTS: The target siRNA with a length of 21 bp was successfully synthesized. Before transfection, somatostatin was strongly and positively expressed in gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901, locating at the cytoplasm. Forty-eight hours after transfection, somatostatin expression was mark edly inhibited and the inhibitory rate in siRNA-transfected cells was significantly higher than that in the cells transfected with empty vector and non-transfected cells (49.71%\u00b10.056% vs 10.49%\u00b10.021%, 0%, both P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: siRNA can inhibit the expression of somatostatin specifically.",

        "abstract": "An upsurge in club drug use has been observed in recent years in some cities of China, especially methamphetamine, which is quickly replacing heroin to become the most widespread drug across the nation. This study investigated the type of drugs used, syphilis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the correlates for syphilis, HCV and unprotected commercial sex behavior among drug users in two cities along the east coast of China.A cross-sectional survey conducted in 2010 provided demographics, sexual and drug use behaviors, HIV knowledge and the utilization of intervention services among drug users. Blood samples were tested for HIV, syphilis, and HCV infection.Of 805 eligible participants, 0.2% were infected with HIV, 3.7% with HCV, and 9.6% with syphilis. Of the participants, 96.6% were methamphetamine users, 11.9% reported ever having used \u22652 types of these drugs, and 11.4% reported ever injecting drugs. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, participants infected with syphilis were more likely to be female (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-6.5), have ever had commercial sex in the past 12 months (AOR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.0-3.9), be infected with HCV (AOR=12.1, 95% CI: 4.1-20.3) and less likely to have ever had sex with regular partners in the past 12 months (AOR=0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.6). Participants infected with HCV were more likely to have ever injected drugs (AOR=2.7, 95% CI: 1.1-6.5) and be infected with syphilis (AOR=8.0, 95% CI: 3.5-18.0). Participants who had unprotected sex with commercial sex partners in the last sexual encounter were more likely to be female (AOR=2.9, 95% CI:1.7-4.9), have middle school or lower level education (AOR=3.4, 95% CI:2.0-5.5), never have received intervention in the last year (AOR=2.1, 95%CI:1.2-3.6) and be infected with syphilis (AOR=4.2, 95% CI:2.4-7.4).Methamphetamine is the predominant drug used among the drug users, the prevalence of syphilis and HCV infection are alarmingly high, and unprotected commercial sex was common among this group. The findings highlight the need for effective, multifaceted interventions addressing sexual and drug use-related risky behaviors among this group. Further research is needed to better understand the causal pathway of the syndemics.",

        "abstract": "To analyze survival time of AIDS death cases receiving Antiretroviral Therapy and related factors.A retrospective cohort study was carried out to collect the data on death cases receiving Antiretroviral Therapy by the National HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Response Information Management System. Kaplan-Meier was used to calculate the median survival time, and compare survival time among different groups of age, sex, marriage status, infectious routes, WHO clinical stage, baseline CD4(+)T cell counts, and interval time from the start of ART to HIV confirmation. Life table and survival curve were applied to describe survival distribution. Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the factors associated with the survival time.Among 142 AIDS death cases, 125 (88.03%) were related with AIDS and 17(11.97%) were not. The total median survival time was 3.100 months (95%CI: 2.279-3.921). The cumulative survival rate was (52 \u00b1 4)%, (33 \u00b1 4)%, (26 \u00b1 4)% in the first 3 months, 3-6 months, and 6-12 months. The median survival time of married or cohabitation group was 2.670 months (95%CI:1.470-3.870), and single (unmarried, divorced, separation, widowed) group was 5.870 months (95%CI: 2.617-9.123). The median survival time of WHO clinical stage I or II group was 5.870 months (95%CI: 3.989-7.751), and WHO clinical stage III or IV group was 1.700 months (95%CI: 0.885-2.515). The median survival time of baseline CD4(+)T cell counts \u2264 50 /\u00b5l group was 1.670 months (95%CI: 0.759-2.581), and 51-199 /\u00b5l group was 4.400 months (95%CI: 2.735-6.065), and \u2265 200/\u00b5l group was 7.100 months (95%CI: 0.000-14.542). The survival time was significantly different among different baseline marital status groups, different WHO clinical stage groups, and different CD4(+)T cell counts groups. The mortality risk of Single (unmarried, divorced, separation, widowed) group was 0.641 times of the risk in married or cohabitation group. The mortality risk of WHO clinical stage III or IV was 1.856 times of the risk in stage I or II. The mortality risk of baseline CD4(+)T cell counts 51-199 /\u00b5l group was 0.582 times of the risk in \u2264 50 /\u00b5l group, and \u2265 200 /\u00b5l group was 0.551 times of the risk in \u2264 50 /\u00b5l group.The total median survival time was relatively short. Most AIDS deaths happened in the first 3 months or 3-6 months after they received Antiretroviral Therapy, and the mortality trend slowed down in the following months. Married or cohabitation, low-baseline CD4(+)T cell counts, or WHO clinical stage III or IV were found to be the risk factors associated with AIDS death cases receiving Antiretroviral Therapy.",

        "abstract": "This study was to investigate the condom use and its factors on sex workers in Shandong province, and to provide effective suggestions for AIDS prevention strategies and interventions.From April to July in 2009, 4732 female sex workers were investigated through anonymous questionnaires from 11 cities which were selected based on the AIDS epidemic, geographic location, economic conditions in Shandong province. Serum samples were collected and antibodies were tested by ELISA and TPPA from 4641 people.4732 female sex workers who were 15 - 58 years old were investigated and the majority belonged to the low age group (\u2264 24 years old) which accounted for 61.5% (2912/4732). Among the 4732 female sex workers, the unmarried, the divorced, or the widowed females accounted for 72.8% (3441/4725) and 72.0% (3403/4726) of them were poorly educated.42.3% (1994/4719) of them were found from other provinces. The right answers for knowledge of AIDS accounted for 45.7% (2164/4732). 80.6% (3416/4236) of these females were found to used condoms in the most recent commercial sex activity. The rate of consistently using condoms in sex activity during the last month was 58.4% (2467/4221). In this survey, 7.3% (337/4637) of investigated females had been diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases, 30.7% (1449/4726) of them had received HIV antibody test, 70.4% (3323/4732) of these people had received the AIDS intervention services, and 3.6% (167/4668) of them had ever used drug. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high education level (junior high school or lower vs senior high school or higher, adjusted OR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.67 - 0.90), having received the HIV intervention (received vs unreceived, adjusted OR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.17 - 1.58), antibody detection (done vs not done, adjusted OR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.15 - 1.55), and good knowledge about AIDS (low score group vs high score group, adjusted OR = 0.37, 95%CI: 0.32 - 0.44) were independent factors that increased safe sex behavior; while using drug (drug vs not drug, adjusted OR = 0.22, 95%CI: 0.15 - 0.31) was a negative factor.The prevalence rate of HIV infection among female sex workers was low in Shandong province. However, the low rate of condom use and the high prevalence of self-reported STD-related symptoms suggested that more attentions should be paid to the factors of risk behaviors, and more targeted interventions are critically needed.",

        "abstract": "To analyze the outcome among HIV-infected children following antiretroviral treatment in Shandong province.From the national AIDS antiviral treatment database during April 2009 and December 2013, 50 children who were according to antiviral treatment in Shandong province were classified as the cases. Regular follow-up observation and test were conducted among children under antiretroviral therapy before treatment,0.5(th), 1(th), 2(th), 3(th), 6(th), 9(th), 12(th) months after treatment, and then one time after every 3 months follow-up after one year. The height and weight of the children under antiretroviral therapy and normal children (2010 national student physical health survey results)were compared during different times. And the height and weight of the follow-up period of situation, the CD4(+)T cell count and viral load, regular physical examination results, the incidence of opportunistic infections were compared with baseline data.Among the 50 children under antiviral therapy, male accounted for 54.0% (27/50) , female 46.0% (23/50) , the youngest was 2 years of age, the oldest was 15 years old, and all of them were transmitted by the mother-to-child route and none received mother-to-child prevention. The shortest treatment time lasted five months, the longest 61 months, with a median 25 months. The height of the baseline, 12(th), 24(th), 36(th) months after antiviral treatment were ( 111.9 \u00b1 23.4), (118.1 \u00b1 20.9), (127.1 \u00b1 13.9), (135.4 \u00b1 10.2)cm, and weigh were ( 20.6 \u00b1 8.7), (23.8 \u00b1 6.3), (27.8 \u00b1 7.2), (30.7 \u00b1 5.5) kg, respectively. The height and weight of the treated children were higher than those in the baseline (P < 0.05), but lower than those among the children without HIV infection. The CD4(+)T lymphocytes level of the baseline, 3(th), 6(th), 12(th), 24(th), 36(th) months after antiviral treatment were 224.0, 279.5, 465.0, 581.0, 640.0, 728.0/\u00b5l, the CD4(+)T lymphocytes level after antiviral treatment were higher than the baseline (P < 0.05). Hemoglobin and AST were significantly different between children received treatment after 24 months and those in the baseline (P < 0.05), baseline and 24(th) months after treatment the hemoglobin value were (106.6 \u00b1 22.2), (125.2 \u00b1 5.8), and the AST measurements were (42.1 \u00b1 23.1), (23.4 \u00b1 15.6). Baseline and 12(th), 24(th) months after treatment, the median of viral load were 10 000.0, 105.0,0.0 copies/ml , and the ratio of viral load \u2264 400 copies/ml were 50% (4/8) , 65% (22/34) , 88% (14/16) , respectively, the results of viral load had significant difference among 12(th), 24(th) months after antiviral treatment and baseline (P < 0.05). The incidence of opportunistic infections was 62% (31/50) before treatment, and 12% (6/50) after the antiviral therapy.Antiviral therapy can effectively improve the immunity and reduce the incidence of opportunistic infections which is helpful to improve the quality of life among HIV-infected children following antiretroviral treatment in Shandong province.",

        "abstract": "It is well documented that glucocorticoids (GC) promote arrest in the G1-S transition of the cell cycle in many cell types, resulting in a decrease in proliferation. However, the relationship between glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the cell-cycle regulation remains unclear. Suppression of GR is important for exploring GR dependent processes. This study applied RNA interference targeting GR to the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Transient transfection of the GR-siRNA expression vector reduced GR synthesis as measured on mRNA and protein level by RT-PCR and Western blot. GR-siRNA also depressesed GR transcriptional activity. A cell line [RAW-(GR-)] stably transfected with GR-siRNA expression vector was then established, the decreased GR level in this cell line was confirmed by Western blot. MTT assay showed RAW-(GR-) cells grew faster than control cells, which indicated that knockdown of GR promoted cell proliferation in macrophages. Further studies showed decreased p27 expression, increased PKC-alpha expression and enhanced basal and LPS-induced NF-kappaB activity in RAW-(GR-) cells as compared to the RAW-control cells. In contrast, virtually no change in p21, ERK1/2 and p38 expression was detected. In conclusion, these results indicate that GR itself is an inhibitor of cell proliferation in RAW264.7 cell line. This effect may be associated with the decreased expression of p27, the increased expression of PKC-alpha, and the activation of NF-kappaB. As all the experiments are carried out in GC free or serum-free medium, this study also shows the possibility for GR to have some constitutive functions, which are independent on GC activation.",

        "abstract": "Soy isoflavones have been implicated to exert benefit on bone loss in postmenopausal women. Isoflavones can induce estrogen response element-mediated transcription in osteoblastic cells. In the present study, we investigate whether isoflavones genistein and daidzein regulate target gene transcription through cAMP regulatory element (CRE) in osteoblastic cells. It was found that 17\u03b2-estradiol (E(2)), genistein and daidzein suppressed the transcriptional activity of CRE-luciferase reporter gene in human osteoblastic cell line MG-63 cells. E(2) and genistein but not daidzein inhibited the cAMP analogue 8-Br cAMP-induced transcription of CRE reporter gene. Both genistein and E(2) inhibited basal and cAMP-induced mRNA levels of endogenous estrogen responsive genes containing CRE/CRE-like elements in their promoter regions, including interleukin (IL) 8 and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1). Daidzein inhibited basal and cAMP-induced IL-8, but not SGK1 mRNA expression. The inhibitory effects of E(2), genistein and daidzein on CRE-mediated transcription activity were enhanced by estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1 overexpression in MG-63 cells, which could be blocked by nonselective ER antagonists ICI182780, 4-OH tamoxifen and specific ER\u03b1 antagonist MPP. Genistein and daidzein, but not E(2) treatment, caused a significant decrease in CRE-mediated transcription activity in ER\u03b2-transfected MG-63 cells, which could be blocked by ICI182780, 4-OH tamoxifen and the selective ER\u03b2 antagonist (R,R)-5,11-diethyl-5.6,11,12-tetradro-2,8-chrysenediol. Our results indicate that isoflavones genistein and daidzein might modulate bone remodeling through ERs by regulating target gene expression through the CRE motifs.",

We investigated the effect of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a H(2)S donor, on the contractility of isolated human myometrium strips from term pregnant women who were undergoing labor. Cumulative effects of NaHS on spontaneous and oxytocin-induced contractility were evaluated by using isometric tension recordings. NaHS (0.1 \u03bcM-1 mM) concentration dependently inhibited spontaneous contractility of laboring myometrium, with a decrease in amplitude and frequency. NaHS (0.1 \u03bcM-1 mM) decreased the frequency but not the amplitude of oxytocin (1 \u03bcM)-induced contractions. NaHS-induced relaxation could be prevented by pretreatment with glibenclamide, an inhibitor of K(+)(ATP) channels. Thus, NaHS evokes relaxation of human pregnant myometrium, suggesting a possible role of H(2)S during human pregnancy.",

To facilitate intubation, the authors used retrograde light-guided laryngoscopy (RLGL) and compared its feasibility with conventional direct laryngoscopy (DL).Twenty operators participated in a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study. These operators intubated 205 patients randomly according to a computer-generated procedure by using either DL or RLGL (five intubations with each technique). The primary outcome was the success rate of tracheal intubation. The authors evaluated the success rate of tracheal intubation, the time to glottic exposure and tracheal intubation, and the Cormack and Lehane grades.Compared with DL, the success rate was greater in the RLGL group for all five intubations (72% vs. 47%; rate difference, 25%; 95% CI [11.84-38.16%], P < 0.001). This was associated with a shorter time to glottic exposure (median [25th and 75th percentile]; 27 [15; 42] vs. 45 [30; 73] s, P < 0.001), shorter intubation time (66 [44; 120] vs. 120 [69; 120] s, P < 0.001), and decreased throat soreness (mean \u00b1 SD; visual analog scale, 2.1 \u00b1 0.9 vs. 3.7 \u00b1 1.0 cm, P = 0.001) in the RLGL group compared to the DL group.RLGL is an alternative intubation technique.

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is the main treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, some patients are resistant to these agents. Abnormalities of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) seem to be related to steroid resistance. This study evaluated GRs in T lymphocytes and monocytes of SLE patients by flow cytometry (FCM) using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) and FITC-Dex probes.Thirty-five patients with SLE before treatment and 27 age- and sex-matched normal controls were studied. Disease activity scores were determined before and after treatment and used to divide the patients into steroid-resistant (SR) and steroid-sensitive (SS) groups. GRs in T lymphocytes (CD3+) and monocytes (CD14+) were examined by FCM with GR-mAb and FITC-Dex probes before treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated for in vitro GCs sensitivity assays. The validity of FCM analysis of intracellular staining for GR with GR-mAb and FITC-Dex probes was evaluated through comparison with western blot and radioligand binding assay (RLBA) in U937 and K562 cells in vitro. One-way ANOVA, student's t test, linear regression and spearman correlation were performed.A significant decrease in GR binding and the expression in K562 and U937 cells with 10-6 M dexamethasone (Dex) was found compared with those without Dex. In addition, a positive correlation was found between FCM and RLBA as well as FCM and Western blot. The expression and binding of both CD3/GR and CD14/GR in SR patients with SLE, detected by FCM, were all lower than those in SS patients with SLE, whereas there was no significant difference in SS patients and controls. In vitro corticosteroid sensitivity assay indicated that PHA-stimulated tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-12 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion was significantly inhibited by 10-6 M Dexamethasone in all controls and SS patients, compared with that in SR group, which confirms patient classification as SR and SS by disease activity index (SLEDAI) score.Abnormalities of expression and binding of the GR may be involved in tissue resistance to steroids in SLE patients. Determination of GR expression and binding by FCM may be useful in predicting the response to steroid treatment of SLE patients.",

        "abstract": "Reversible adrenal insufficiency frequently has been diagnosed in critically ill patients with sepsis who have either low basal cortisol levels or low cortisol responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation. It is generally accepted that a phenomenon called \"endotoxin tolerance\" contributes to immunosuppression during sepsis. The present study was to investigate whether endotoxin tolerance occurs in the adrenal gland, leading to hyporesponsiveness of adrenal gland during sepsis.Controlled laboratory experiment.University research laboratory.Sprague-Dawley male rats 200-250 g and primary isolated adrenal fasciculata-reticularis cells.Rats received intra-arterial injection of purified lipopolysaccharide (0.5 mg/kg) through indwelling femoral arterial catheters, and 24 hrs later the adrenocortical sensitivity to exogenous ACTH (10 ng/kg) was detected. Primary fasciculata-reticularis cells were pretreated with lipopolysaccharide at 0.1-100 ng/mL or with ACTH at 0.01-10 ng/mL and then challenged, in fresh media, with 1 \u03bcg/mL lipopolysaccharide or 10 ng/mL ACTH.Toll-like receptor 4 was expressed in adrenal gland and primary fasciculata-reticularis cells. Plasma corticosterone response to ACTH was decreased in rats receiving preinjection of lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment caused a significant decrease in corticosterone production in response to subsequent ACTH and lipopolysaccharide stimulation in primary fasciculata-reticularis cells. Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment inhibited ACTH- and lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of steroid metabolizing enzymes. Lipopolysaccharide significantly decreased Toll-like receptor 4 and ACTH receptor expression.Pre-exposure to lipopolysaccharide resulted in hyporesponsiveness to ACTH stimulation in rats. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide pretreatment impaired corticosterone production of fasciculata-reticularis cells in response to ACTH and lipopolysaccharide, which was associated with decreased expression of synthetic enzymes required for corticosterone production. Our results indicate that endotoxin tolerance of adrenal gland is one of the mechanisms for adrenocortical insufficiency during sepsis.",

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the combined effects of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, sivelestat sodium, with a free radical scavenger, edaravone, on lipolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI).Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and instilled intratracheally with 2 mg/kg LPS. Sivelestat sodium (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and/or edaravone (8 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered 1 h after LPS instillation. The severity of pulmonary injuries was evaluated 12 h after inducing acute lung injury.In lung tissues, either sivelestat or edaravone treatment alone showed significant protective effects against neutrophil infiltration and tissue injury, as demonstrated by myeloperoxidase activity and histopathological analysis. Sivelestat or edaravone treatment also attenuated the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in rat lungs. However, the LPS-induced elevation of malondialdehyde levels in rat lungs was reduced only by edaravone, but not by sivelestat. In addition, combined treatment with both sivelestat and edaravone demonstrated additive protective effects on LPS-induced lung injury, compared with single treatments.Combination of sivelestat and edaravone shows promise as a new treatment option for ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.",

        "abstract": "Metabolites profiling provides global insights in characterisations and interactions of metabolites under specific physiological or pathologic states. The aim of this study was to examine serum metabolic changes in bilateral ovariectomised (OVX) rats and those exposed to 17\u03b2-oestradiol (E(2), 30\u2009\u03bcg/kg bw, sc.) or genistein (50\u2009\u03bcg/kg bw, sc.) for 12 weeks.Serum samples were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-q-TOF-MS). Significant variables were found by the orthogonal partial least-squares analysis and identified by matching their tandem MS fragmentation patterns with reference standards.There were 54 variables changed in OVX group compared with sham group. Genistein might induce more intensive changes of metabolites than E(2) in OVX rats. Among the 54 significant variables of OVX group, 8 and 20 were found to be affected by E(2) and genistein, respectively. Finally, four of them were identified as arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol. Both E(2) and genistein could reverse levels of AA, EPA and ergocalciferol to sham levels. Only genistein treatment could reverse the level of cholecalciferol.This study provided a serum profile of ovary dysfunction and showed some similarities and differences between E(2) and genistein treatments of the OVX model.",

        "abstract": "Human uterus undergoes distinct molecular and functional changes during pregnancy and parturition. Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently been shown to play a key role in the control of smooth muscle tension. The role of endogenous H(2)S produced locally in the control of uterine contractility during labour is unknown.Human myometrium biopsies were obtained from pregnant women undergoing cesarean section at term. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-\u03b2-synthetase (CBS), the principle enzymes responsible for H(2)S generation, were mainly localized to smooth muscle cells of human pregnant myometrium. The mRNA and protein expression of CBS as well as H(2)S production rate were down-regulated in labouring tissues compared to nonlabouring tissues. Cumulative administration of L-cysteine (10(-7)-10(-2) mol/L), a precursor of H(2)S, caused a dose-dependent decrease in the amplitude of spontaneous contractions in nonlabouring and labouring myometrium strips. L-cysteine at high concentration (10(-3) mol/L) increased the frequency of spontaneous contractions and induced tonic contraction. These effects of L-cysteine were blocked by the inhibitors of CBS and CSE. Pre-treatment of myometrium strips with glibenclamide, an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels, abolished the inhibitory effect of L-cysteine on spontaneous contraction amplitude. The effects of L-cysteine on the amplitude of spontaneous contractions and baseline muscle tone were less potent in labouring tissues than that in nonlabouring strips.H(2)S generated by CSE and CBS locally exerts dual effects on the contractility of pregnant myometrium. Expression of H(2)S synthetic enzymes is down-regulated during labour, suggesting that H(2)S is one of the factors involved in the transition of pregnant uterus from quiescence to contractile state after onset of parturition.",

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoid (GC) effectively suppresses immune and inflammatory responses and inhibits the growth of several types of cells, but the role of GC and its receptor on macrophage proliferation is unclear. In our previous work, we found RAW-GR(-) cells (murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells stably transfected with GR-siRNA expression vector by RNA interference) grew faster by about twofold. In this study, we further explored the role and mechanisms of GC/GR on the proliferation of macrophage. We found that the growth of RAW264.7 cells was inhibited by dexamethasone (Dex) in a concentration-dependent manner. The mRNA and protein levels of signal regulatory protein \u03b11 (SIRPA) were induced by GC/GR in RAW264.7 cells and SIRPA expression was decreased remarkably in RAW-GR(-) cells. Overexpression of SIRPA negatively regulated the proliferation of RAW-GR(-) cells, and inhibition of SIRPA expression by a small from RNA interference attenuated Dex-induced proliferation inhibition in RAW264.7 cells. The proliferation inhibition of GC/GR was also found in mouse peritoneal macrophage, which was associated with the increase in SIRPA induced by GC/GR as well. In addition, elevation of the expression of CDK2, cyclinD1, and cyclinB1, but not phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38, was found in RAW-GR(-) cells. In conclusion, we provided the novel evidences that GC/GR inhibited the growth of RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophage, and the antiproliferative effect of GC/ GR on these cells was at least in part a result from GC/GR-induced SIRPA expression. Up-regulation of CDK2, cyclinD1, and cyclinB1 was also related to the increased proliferation of RAW-GR(-) cells. \u00a9 2008 Society for Endocrinology.",

        "abstract": "The effects of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones are mediated via an intracellular receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). It has been established that glucocorticoid down-regulate GR. Ginsenosides (GSS) from extract of Panax ginseng have demonstrated glucocorticoid-like activities in homeostasis and regulation of immunity, etc. We hypothesize that ginsenosides might mediate some of their actions by binding to the GR. The present study is aimed to determine whether GSS can act like a GC analog in the activation of glucocorticoid response element-luciferase activity in HL7702 cells. We found that GSS alone had no effect on the expression of reporter gene, but it enhanced dexamethasone (Dex)-induced transcription of reporter gene. To further explore the effects of GSS, we examined the influence of GSS on the gene and protein expression as well as hormone binding activity of GR by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and radioligand-binding assay, respectively. GSS partially reversed the Dex-induced decrease in GR expression and hormone binding activity with an optimal dose of 25 microg/ml, implicating a positive regulatory effect of GSS on GR expression and binding activity. Therefore, our result suggests that GSS may reverse partially the dexamethasone-induced down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor.",

        "abstract": "Although glucocorticoid (GC) has been reported to inhibit macrophage killing activity and cytokine production in response to proinflammatory stimuli, the effect of GC on macrophage proliferation is controversial. In our previous study, we found that inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells (RAW-GR(-) cells) by RNAi significantly promoted cell proliferation. In the present study, we provide the evidence that the expression of Rhob, a member of Rho GTPases with anti-cancer character, remarkably decreased in RAW-GR(-) and RAW264.7 cells transiently transfected with GR-RNAi vector. Overexpression or constitutive activation of Rhob in RAW-GR(-) and RAW264.7 cells by transfection with wild-type Rhob expression vector (Rhob-wt) or constitutively activated Rhob plasmid (Rhob-V14) resulted in decreased proliferation of the two cell lines. Oppositely, the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells was significantly increased when the expression of Rhob by RNA interference technique or the activity of Rhob by transfection with dominant negative Rhob mutant that is defective in nucleotide binding (Rhob-N19) was inhibited. In addition, enhanced activity of Akt, but not MAPK3/1 or MAPK14, was found in RAW-GR(-) cells. Blocking the pathway of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt with the specific inhibitor LY294002 decreased the proliferation and elevated RHOB protein level, indicating that PI3K/Akt signal plays its role of proliferation modulation upstream of RHOB protein. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that Rhob plays an important role in the antiproliferative effect of GR on RAW264.7 cells by GR-->Akt-->Rhob signaling and Rhob negatively regulates the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis, the leading cause of death in intensive care units, is associated with overproduction of nitric oxide (NO). The mechanism concerning the NO production in the sepsis caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria is largely unknown. The present study examines the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on Staphylococcus aureus-induced NO production in macrophages. In the na\u00efve murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7, heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (HKSa) induced a significant NO production at a high concentration (100 microg/ml). However, pretreatment of the cells with increasing concentration of LPS (10-50 ng/ml) resulted in induction of NO production by HKSa even at the doses of 1 and 10 microg/ml. The expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in response to HKSa was also enhanced by LPS pretreatment, suggesting that LPS priming NO production is due to the enhancement of iNOS expression. We examined whether protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and calcineurin signaling pathways are involved in the priming effects of LPS. It was found that the PKC inhibitor G\u00f66976, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A significantly reversed the priming effects of LPS on HKSa-induced NO production and iNOS expression. In contrast, the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 did not block the induction of priming by LPS. These data support the hypothesis that LPS primes macrophages for enhancement of HKSa-induced NO production, and indicate that PKC, p38 and calcineurin might be involved in the LPS-induced priming.",

MiRNA has been demonstrated to protect cardiomyocytes against apoptosis during IR, while whether it has anti-autophagy effect has not been known. The aim of this study was to investigate whether miR-204 regulated autophagy by regulating LC3-II protein, which is the marker of autophagosome during myocardial IR injury.Adult SD rats were randomized to Control and IR groups. IR group was treated with 30 min ischemia by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by 2 h reperfusion by loosing the ligation. The expression of miR-204 was measured by RT-PCR, and LC3 protein was measured by western-blot.We found that IR induced cardiomyocytes autophagy, together with down-regulation of miR-204 and up-regulation of LC3-II protein. And, we have found that LC3-II protein was regulated by miR-204, using the method of transferring miR-204 mimic or AMO-204 into the cardiomyocytes, before.These studies provided evidence that miR-204 played an important role in regulating autophagy through LC3-IIprotein during IR.",

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated the CSE expression and H2S production rate. L-cysteine reduced LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production. CSE inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effect of L-cysteine. CSE knockdown increased, whereas CSE overexpression decreased LPS-induced NO production. Dexamethasone suppressed LPS-induced CSE expression and the H2S production rate as well as NO production. L-arginine increased, whereas NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) decreased LPS-induced CSE expression and H2S production. Dexamethasone plus L-NAME significantly decreased LPS-induced CSE expression and H2S production compared to L-NAME. Our results suggest that macrophages are one of the H2S producing sources. H 2S might exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NO production. Dexamethasone may directly inhibit CSE expression and H2S production, besides the NO-dependent way.

The authors determine the localization, concentrations, and variants of CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 in the human pregnant myometrium from patients undergoing labor and patients not undergoing labor. Biopsies were taken from 40 patients undergoing either elective or emergency cesarean delivery after spontaneous labor. The localization of CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 was examined by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein levels of CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 were measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. The variants of CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 were determined by PCR analysis followed by sequencing. Both CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 were found by immunohistochemistry to be expressed by smooth muscle cells in the pregnant myometrium. There was no significant difference in mRNA and protein levels of CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 in myometria between the labor and nonlabor groups. Levels of CRH-R1 alpha , R1 beta, R1c, R1e, R1f, and R2 alpha were identified in the pregnant myometrium, and levels of CRH-R1 alpha, R1c, and R2 alpha were detected in both the term labor and nonlabor myometrium. A heterogeneous distribution of other CRH-R1 variants in term labor and nonlabor myometrium was observed. Human myometrium expresses both CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 during pregnancy. A heterogeneous distribution of CRH-R1 variants in term labor and nonlabor myometrium might be related to the effects of CRH on contractile phenotype of myometrium at the term.",

        "abstract": "Lung injury induced by ischemia or reperfusion significantly accounts for the risk of early mortality of lung transplantation (LT). Recent studies have demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and its endogenous synthase cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE) confer protection against injury induced by ischemia or reperfusion in various organs. This prompted us to define the role of CSE/H2S pathway in transplantation-induced lung injury.We performed single left LT in male Sprague-Dawley rats after 3 h of cold ischemia time. H2S donor NaHS (14 \u03bcmol/kg, intraperitoneally) or CSE inhibitor propargylglycine (37.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered 15 min before the start of the LT. CSE protein expression, H2S generation, and the severity of pulmonary graft injuries were estimated at 24 h after reperfusion.Both CSE protein expression and H2S generation were markedly decreased in transplanted rat lungs compared with those in sham-operated lungs. In the lung-transplanted rats, NaHS administration significantly improved pulmonary function and decreased lipid peroxidation and myeloperoxidase activity. In addition, NaHS inhibited the production of interleukin 1\u03b2 but increased interleukin 10 levels in graft lung tissues. In contrast, propargylglycine further exacerbated pulmonary function and lung injuries after experimental orthotopic LT.To our knowledge, this study for the first time has demonstrated that the suppression of CSE expression and H2S production is associated with transplantation-induced lung injury. Both exogenous and endogenous H2S seem to have protective effects against acute LT injury by their multiple functions including antioxidation and anti-inflammation, suggesting that modulation of H2S levels may be considered a potential therapeutic approach in LT.",

        "abstract": "We previously reported that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) blockade (injected with GR antagonist RU486) primed the host responses to lipopolysaccharide. Since decrease of GR and elevated glucocorticoids (GCs) have been always reported as parallel responses, we hypothesize that both GCs and GR play important roles in GR blockade induced priming. We first confirm that the production of nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O2-), and PKCalpha expression are all increased in peritoneal macrophages from GR blockade rats, indicating that macrophages are primed by GR blockade. Furthermore, using unilateral adrenalectomy rats, we find that the elevated GCs caused by a feedback mechanism following GR blockade may be involved in the process of priming. In vitro experiments in RAW264.7 cells show the inhibitory effect of GCs on NO production, which can be thoroughly blocked by RU486, indicating the increase of NO production in GR blockade rats is due to the elimination of GCs's anti-inflammatory function. In contrast, 10(-7) M corticosterone induces significant increases in O2- release, PKCalpha expression and phosphorylation, which cannot be reversed by RU486, demonstrating a previously unrecognized pro-inflammatory role of GCs in enhancing PM activation through a GR-independent pathway. The effect of GCs on PKCalpha expression even exists in GR deficient COS-7 cells as well as in GR knock-down RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, both GR impairment and elevation of GCs are involved in the priming of macrophages caused by GR blockade. The findings of the divergent roles of GCs in modulation of inflammation may change therapeutic strategy for inflammatory diseases with GCs.",

        "abstract": "Phytoestrogens may function as partial agonists or antagonists of estrogen in many tissues including bone. Five phytoestrogens,\n belonging to the isoflavones and the flavonoids groups, were assayed in the human MG-63 osteoblastic cell line for their ability\n to stimulate transcriptional activity of an estrogen-response element (ERE)-luciferase reporter gene via the estrogen receptor\n \u03b2 (ER\u03b2). Although MG-63 cells were shown to express endogenous estrogen receptors, estradiol (E2) did not affect transcriptional activity of an ERE reporter in these cells. However, E2 did activate the ERE-reporter significantly in MG-63 cells where ER\u03b2 was overexpressed. The isoflavones, genistein and daidzein,\n caused a dose-dependent increase in the ERE-reporter activity in MG-63 cells overexpressing ER\u03b2. Among the flavonoids, kaempferol\n activated ERE-reporter activity, whereas puerarin inhibited ERE-reporter transcription in cells overexpressing ER\u03b2. Quercetin\n had no effect on ERE-reporter activity over a concentration range of 10\u221210\u201310\u22126\u00a0mol/l. The ERE-reporter activity induced by daidzein, genistein, and kaempferol was blocked by both ICI 182780 and 4-hydroxytamoxifen\n and partly blocked by puerarin. Our results demonstrated that different phytoestrogens exhibited differential transcription\n activity of an ERE-reporter via ER\u03b2-mediated mechanisms in MG-63 cells.",

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used to treat inflammatory diseases. However, they cause debilitating side effects, which limit the use of these compounds. In the past decade, many researchers have attempted to find so-called dissociated GCs that have separate distinct transactivation and transrepression activities. Anti-inflammation of GCs is a result of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated transactivation and transrepression in some tissues, similar to their side effects; therefore, the goal to discover a compound that has anti-inflammatory properties, but lacks the negative side effects seen with GCs, has yet to be achieved. In the present study, we introduce a plant-derived compound, ginsenoside Rg1, which possesses GC and estrogen-like activities. In this study, we show that Rg1 downmodulates LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine release and inhibits NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity. The negative effects on NF-\u03baB activation are due to a decrease in I\u03baB phosphorylation and protein stabilization. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of Rg1 on NF-\u03baB is GR-dependent, as small interfering RNA knockdown of GR abrogated this function. Rg1 also displayed profound inhibitory effects on LPS-induced MAPK activation. Importantly, Rg1 did not impair proliferation or differentiation of mouse osteoblasts. Finally, we show that Rg1 can effectively inhibit acute and chronic inflammation in vivo, but it does not cause hyperglycemia or osteoporosis as seen with dexamethasone. These results suggest that ginsenoside Rg1 may serve as a novel anti-inflammatory agent and may exhibit a potential profile for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism underlying estrogen cardioprotection remains largely unknown. Urocortin (UCN), a member of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) family, is one of endogenous cardioprotective factors. The goal of present study is to investigate whether estrogens regulate UCN and its receptor CRH receptor type 2 (CRHR2) in female rat heart.17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) was subcutaneously administrated to ovariectomized (OVX) rats for eight weeks. UCN was administrated before simulated myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Cell damage was assessed by measurement of infarct size, activity of serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and percentage of TUNEL staining in myocardium. The mRNA and protein levels of UCN and CRHR2 were determined in sham operated and OVX rats with or without E2 replacement. DNA methylation frequency of CRHR2 gene promoter was determined by bisulfite-sequencing.UCN administration reduced infarct size, LDH and CK level and percentage of TUNEL staining upon I/R injury. The cardioprotective effects of UCN were abrogated in OVX rats and E2 replacement restored UCN-induced cardioprotection.CRHR2 mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated more than 40% in OVX rats, both of which were restored by E2 replacement. UCN mRNA and protein levels were not affected by ovariectomy and E2 replacement. Hypermethylation in CRHR2 promoter was found in OVX rats, and two of the methylated CpG sites were seated at cis-acting elements. Hypermethylation induced by OVX could also be ameliorated by E2 replacement.Estrogens maintain CRHR2 expression in myocardium, which may through an epigenetic mechanism, and enhance UCN-induced cardioprotective effects against I/R injury.",

        "abstract": "Impaired lung function is the primary contributor to most deaths associated with severe acute pancreatitis. It is widely accepted that oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and associated complications. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether therapeutic treatment with the free radical scavenger edaravone could protect rats against acute pancreatitis and the associated lung injury. Acute pancreatitis was induced by infusion of 1ml/kg of sodium taurocholate (3% solution) into the biliopancreatic duct. Edaravone (8mg/kg) was administered 1h and 13h after inducing pancreatitis, the severity of pancreatic and pulmonary injuries was evaluated 24h after inducing pancreatitis. Edaravone treatment significantly reduced the elevated malondialdehyde levels in rat lungs after acute pancreatitis, suggesting an important role for free radicals in acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury. In addition, edaravone showed significant protective effects against neutrophil infiltration and tissue injury in both pancreas and lung, as demonstrated by serum amylase levels, myeloperoxidase activity and histopathological analysis. Edaravone treatment also attenuated the elevated mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in rat lungs after acute pancreatitis. In conclusion, edaravone protects rats against acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury, probably through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, edaravone shows promise as a treatment for lung injury in patients with acute pancreatitis.",

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoid (GC) effectively suppresses immune and inflammatory responses and inhibits the growth of several types of cells, but the role of GC and its receptor on macrophage proliferation is unclear. In our previous work, we found RAW- GR(K) cells (murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells stably transfected with GR-siRNA expression vector by RNA interference) grew faster by about twofold. In this study, we further explored the role and mechanisms of GC/GR on the proliferation of macrophage. We found that the growth of RAW264.7 cells was inhibited by dexamethasone (Dex) in a concentration-dependent manner. The mRNA and protein levels of signal regulatory protein a1 (SIRPA) were induced by GC/GR in RAW264.7 cells and SIRPA expression was decreased remarkably in RAW-GR(K) cells. Overexpression of SIRPA negatively regulated the proliferation of RAW-GR(K) cells, and inhibition of SIRPA expression by a small from RNA interference attenuated Dex-induced proliferation inhibition in RAW264.7 cells. The proliferation inhibition of GC/GR was also found in mouse peritoneal macrophage, which was associated with the increase in SIRPA induced by GC/GR as well. In addition, elevation of the expression of CDK2, cyclinD1, and cyclinB1, but not phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38, was found in RAW-GR(K) cells. In conclusion, we provided the novel evidences that GC/GR inhibited the growth of RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophage, and the antiproliferative effect of GC/GR on these cells was at least in part a result from GC/GR-induced SIRPA expression. Up-regulation of CDK2, cyclinD1, and cyclinB1 was also related to the increased proliferation of RAW-GR(K) cells.",

Methods: Male adult SD rats, weighing 250-300g, were randomly divided into 2 groups, namely, the control group, in which rats underwent thoracotomy without left anterior descending coronary (LAD) ligation, and IR group, in which the left anterior descending coronary arteries were ligated for 45 min, followed by reperfusion for 2 h. Beclin 1 and Atg5 mRNA expression levels were examined by RT-PCR in the myocardium, and the LC3 protein was determined by Western blotting analysis. Results: Beclin 1 and Atg5 mRNA expression levels in IR group increased to 2.45 and 1.6 times those of the control group, respectively (P<0.05). The expression of LC3-II protein was increased, which led to significant increase of LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in IR group (1.4 vs 0.2, P<0.01). Conclusion: Ischemia-reperfusion injury can induce expression of Atg family, promoting autophagy and causing cardiomyocyte damage.",

        "abstract": "In a previous study, we showed that endogenous hydrogen sulfide (HS) plays a key role in the maintenance of intact adrenal cortex function via the protection of mitochondrial function during endoxemia. We further investigated whether mitochondria-mediated apoptosis is involved in HS protection of adrenal function. LPS treatment resulted in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the adrenal glands of male mice, and these effects were prevented by the HS donor GYY4137. In the model of Y1 cells, the LPS-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and blunt response to ACTH were rescued by GYY4137. The HS-generating enzyme cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (CBS) knockout heterozygous (CBS) mice showed mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the adrenal gland and adrenal insufficiency. GYY4137 treatment restored adrenal function and eliminated mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Maleimide assay combined with mass spectrometry analysis showed that a number of proteins in mitochondria were S-sulfhydrated in the adrenal gland. ATP5A1 was further confirmed as S-sulfhydrated using a modified biotin switch assay. The level of S-sulfhydrated ATP5A1 was decreased in the adrenal gland of endotoxemic and CBS mice, which was restored by GYY4137. ATP5A1 was identified as sulfhydrated at cysteine 244 by HS. Overexpression of the cysteine 244 mutant ATP5A1 in Y1 cells resulted in a loss of LPS-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and GYY4137 restoration of LPS-induced hyporesponsiveness to ACTH. Collectively, the present study revealed that decreased HS generation leads to mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in the adrenal cortex and a blunt response to ACTH. S-sulfhydration of ATP5A1 at cysteine 244 is an important molecular mechanism by which HS maintains mitochondrial function and steroidogenesis in the adrenal glands.",

        "abstract": "The number of regulatory T\u00a0cells\u00a0(Treg cells) and the expression of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase\u00a01\u00a0(ENTPD1; also known as CD39) and 5'-ectonucleotidase (NT5E; also known as CD73) on the Treg cell surface are increased during sepsis. In this study, to determine the factors leading to the high expression of CD39 and CD73, and the regulation of the CD39/CD73/adenosine pathway in Treg cells under septic conditions, we constructed a mouse model of sepsis and separated the Treg cells using a flow cytometer. The Treg cells isolated from the peritoneal lavage and splenocytes of the mice were treated with adenosine or the specific adenosine\u00a0A2A receptor agonist, CGS21680, and were transfected with specific siRNA targeting E2F transcription factor\u00a01\u00a0(E2F-1) or cyclic adenosine monophosphate\u00a0(cAMP) response element-binding protein\u00a0(CREB), which are predicted transcription regulatory factors of CD39 or CD73. The regulatory relationships among these factors were then determined by western blot analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay. In addition, changes in adenosine metabolism were measured in the treated cells. The results revealed that adenosine and CGS21680 significantly upregulated CD39 and CD73 expression\u00a0(P<0.01). E2F-1 and CREB induced CD39 and CD73 expression, and were upregulated by adenosine and CGS21680. Adenosine triphosphate\u00a0(ATP) hydrolysis and adenosine generation were inhibited by the knockdown of E2F-1 or CREB, and were accelerated in the presence of CGS21680. Based on these results, it can be inferred that adenosine, the adenosine\u00a0A2A\u00a0receptor agonist, E2F-1 and CREB are the possible factors contributing to the high expression of CD39 and CD73 on the Treg cell surface during sepsis. Adenosine and its A2A\u00a0receptor agonist served as the signal transducer factors of the CD39/CD73/adenosine pathway, accelerating adenosine generation. Our study may benefit further research on adenosine metabolism for the treatment of sepsis. ",

        "abstract": "Saikosaponin-d (SSd) is one of the major triterpenoid saponins derived from Bupleurum\u00a0falcatum L., which has been reported to possess antifibrotic activity. At present, there is little information regarding the potential target of SSd in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which serve an important role in excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition during the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis. Our recent study indicated that SSd may be considered a novel type of phytoestrogen with estrogen\u2011like actions. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of SSd on the proliferation and activation of HSCs, and the underlying mechanisms associated with estrogen receptors. In the present study, a rat HSC line (HSC\u2011T6) was used and cultured with dimethyl sulfoxide, SSd, or estradiol (E2; positive control), in the presence or absence of three estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists [ICI\u2011182780, methylpiperidinopyrazole (MPP) or (R,R)-tetrahydrochrysene (THC)], for 24\u00a0h as pretreatment. Oxidative stress was induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide for 4\u00a0h. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT growth assay. Malondialdehyde (MDA), CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), hydroxyproline (Hyp) and collagen-1 (COL1) levels in cell culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by \ufb02ow cytometry. Total and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) were examined by western blot analysis. TGF-\u03b21 mRNA expression was determined by RT-quantitative (q)PCR. SSd and E2 were able to significantly suppress oxidative stress\u2011induced proliferation and activation of HSC\u2011T6 cells. Furthermore, SSd and E2 were able to reduce ECM deposition, as demonstrated by the decrease in transforming growth factor\u2011\u03b21, hydroxyproline, collagen\u20111 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases\u20111, and by the increase in matrix metalloproteinase\u20111. These results suggested that the possible molecular mechanism could involve downregulation of the reactive oxygen species/mitogen\u2011activated protein kinases signaling pathway. Finally, the effects of SSd and E2 could be blocked by co\u2011incubation with ICI\u2011182780 or THC, but not MPP, thus indicating that ER\u03b2 may be the potential target of SSd in HSC\u2011T6 cells. In conclusion, these findings suggested that SSd may suppress oxidative stress\u2011induced activation of HSCs, which relied on modulation of ER\u03b2.",

        "abstract": "Exercise could be a therapeutic approach for cardiovascular dysfunction induced by estrogen deficiency. Our previous study has shown that estrogen maintains cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE) expression and inhibits oxidative stress in the myocardium of female rats. In the present study, we investigated whether exercise improves CSE expression and oxidative stress status and ameliorates isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac damage in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. The results showed that treadmill training restored the ovariectomy-induced reduction of CSE and estrogen receptor (ER)\u03b1 and decrease of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and increase of malondialdehyde (MDA). The level of CSE was positively correlated to T-AOC and ER\u03b1 while inversely correlated to MDA. OVX rats showed increases in the serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the percentage of TUNEL staining in myocardium upon ISO insult compared to sham rats. Exercise training significantly reduced the serum levels of LDH and CK and the percentage of TUNEL staining in myocardium upon ISO insult in OVX rats. In cultured cardiomyocytes, ISO treatment decreased cell viability and increased LDH release, while overexpression of CSE increased cell viability and decreased LDH release in the cells upon ISO insult. The results suggest that exercise training improves the oxidative stress status and ameliorates the cardiac damage induced by oxidative stress in OVX rats. The improvement of oxidative stress status by exercise might be at least partially due to upregulation of CSE/H2S signaling.",

Our experimental results indicate that the convergence speed is accelerated with orders of magnitude and in most cases the error function descends monotonically while the network complexity increases less and the recognition rates are almost the same among the different comparative experiments.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge representation is an important, long-history topic in AI, and there have been a large amount of work for knowledge graph embedding which projects symbolic entities and relations into low-dimensional, real-valued vector space. However, most embedding methods merely concentrate on data fitting and ignore the explicit semantic expression, leading to uninterpretable representations. Thus, traditional embedding methods have limited potentials for many applications such as question answering, and entity classification. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic representation method for knowledge graph textbf{(KSR)}, which imposes a two-level hierarchical generative process that globally extracts many aspects and then locally assigns a specific category in each aspect for every triple. Since both aspects and categories are semantics-relevant, the collection of categories in each aspect is treated as the semantic representation of this triple. Extensive experiments justify our model outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines substantially.",

Users may welcome a more general QA system for its capability to answer questions of various sources, integrated from existed specialized sub-QA engines. In this framework, question classification is the primary task. However, the current paradigms of question classification were focused on some specified type of questions, i.e. factoid questions, which are inappropriate for the general QA. In this paper, we propose a new question classification paradigm, which includes a question taxonomy suitable to the general QA and a question classifier based on MLN (Markov logic network), where rule-based methods and statistical methods are unified into a single framework in a fuzzy discriminative learning approach. Experiments show that our method outperforms traditional question classification approaches.",

        "abstract": "Over recent years, there has been a growing interest in extracting entities and relations from biomedical literature. There are a vast number of systems and approaches being proposed to extract biological relations, but none of them achieves satisfactory results. These methodologies are either parsing-based or pattern-based, which are not competent to handle the grammatical complexities of biomedical texts, or too complicated to be adapted. It is well known that appositive, coordinative propositions and such grammatical structures are extremely common in biomedical texts, particularly in full texts. However, these problems are still untouched for most of researchers.In this paper, we have proposed a new approach, which is hybrid with both shallow parsing and pattern matching, to extract relations between proteins from scientific papers of biomedical themes. In the method, appositive and coordinative structures are interpreted based on the shallow parsing analysis, with both syntactic and semantic constraints. Then long sentences are splitted into sub-ones, from which relations are extracted by a greedy pattern matching algorithm, along with automatically generated patterns.Our approach is experimented to extract protein-protein interactions from full biomedical texts, and has achieved an average F-score of 80% on individual verbs, and 66% on all verbs. With the help of shallow parsing analysis, pattern matching is improved remarkably. Compared with the traditional pattern matching algorithm, our approach achieves about 7% improvement of both precision and F-score. In contrast to other systems, our approach achieves performance comparable to the best. A demo system has been available at http://spies.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn.",

        "abstract": "Linear-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF) has been applied to perform the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task in many biomedical text mining and information extraction systems. However, the linear-chain CRF cannot capture long distance dependency, which is very common in the biomedical literature. In this paper, we propose a novel study of capturing such long distance dependency by defining two principles of constructing skip-edges for a skip-chain CRF: linking similar words and linking words having typed dependencies. The approach is applied to recognize gene/protein mentions in the literature. When tested on the BioCreAtIvE II Gene Mention dataset and GENIA corpus, the approach contributes significant improvements over the linear-chain CRF. We also present in-depth error analysis on inconsistent labeling and study the influence of the quality of skip edges on the labeling performance.",

However, the performance of supervised methods highly relies on manually labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation framework for sentiment- and topic- lexicon co-extraction in a domain of interest where we do not require any labeled data, but have lots of labeled data in another related domain. The framework is twofold. In the first step, we generate a few high-confidence sentiment and topic seeds in the target domain. In the second step, we propose a novel Relational Adaptive bootstraPping (RAP) algorithm to expand the seeds in the target domain by exploiting the labeled source domain data and the relationships between topic and sentiment words. Experimental results show that our domain adaptation framework can extract precise lexicons in the target domain without any annotation.",

        "abstract": "Aspect-level sentiment analysis aims to provide complete and detailed view of sentiment analysis from different aspects. Existing solutions usually adopt a two-staged approach: first detecting aspect category in a document, then categorizing the polarity of opinion expressions for detected aspect(s). Inevitably, such methods lead to error accumulation. Moreover, aspect detection and aspect-level sentiment classification are highly correlated with each other. The key issue here is how to perform aspect detection and aspect-level sentiment classification jointly, and effectively. In this paper, we propose the aspect-level sentiment capsules model (AS-Capsules), which is capable of performing aspect detection and sentiment classification simultaneously, in a joint manner. AS-Capsules utilizes the correlation between aspect and sentiment through shared components including capsule embedding, shared encoders, and shared attentions. AS-Capsules is also capable of communicating with different capsules through a shared Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). More importantly, AS-Capsules model does not require any linguistic knowledge as additional input. Instead, through the attention mechanism, this model is able to attend aspect related words and sentiment words corresponding to different aspect(s). Experiments show that the AS-Capsules model achieves state-of-the-art performances on a benchmark dataset for aspect-level sentiment analysis.\n\n",

Despite its significance and value in many downstream applications, this task is less studied on noisy data. The major challenges exists in 1) the lack of annotation on mention phrases, and more severely, 2) handling noisy sentences which do not express a relation at all. To address the two challenges, we formulate the task as a semi-Markov decision process and propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning model. Our model consists of a top-level sentence selector to remove noisy sentences, a low-level mention extractor to extract relation mentions, and a reward estimator to provide signals to guide data denoising and mention extraction without explicit annotations. Experimental results show that our model is effective to extract relation mentions from noisy data.",

Thus, traditional embedding methods have limited potentials for many applications such as question answering, and entity classification. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic representation method for knowledge graph textbf{(KSR)}, which imposes a two-level hierarchical generative process that globally extracts many aspects and then locally assigns a specific category in each aspect for every triple. Since both aspects and categories are semantics-relevant, the collection of categories in each aspect is treated as the semantic representation of this triple. Extensive experiments justify our model outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines substantially.",

Effective patent mining in massive patent databases can provide companies with valuable insights to develop strategies for IP management and marketing. In this paper, we study a novel patent mining problem of automatically discovering core patents (i.e., patents with high novelty and influence in a domain). We address the unique patent vocabulary usage problem, which is not considered in traditional word-based statistical methods, and propose a topic-based temporal mining approach to quantify a patent's novelty and influence.

We incorporate answer quality and answer content to build a probabilistic question routing model. Our proposed model is capable of 1) differentiating and quantifying the authority of users for different topic or category; 2) routing questions to users with expertise.

Current state-of-the-art models are translation-based model, which build embeddings by treating relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. However, previous models is too strict to model the complex and diverse entities and relations(e.g. symmetric/transitive/one-to-many/many-to-many relations). To address these issues, we propose a new principle to allow flexible translation between entity and relation vectors. We can design a novel score function to favor flexible translation for each translation-based models without increasing model complexity. To evaluate the proposed principle, we incorporate it into previous method and conduct triple classification on benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the principle can remarkably improve the performance compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding aims at offering a numerical knowledge representation paradigm by transforming the entities and relations into continuous vector space. However, existing methods could not characterize the knowledge graph in a fine degree to make a precise link prediction. There are two reasons for this issue: being an ill-posed algebraic system and adopting an overstrict geometric form. As precise link prediction is critical for knowledge graph embedding, we propose a manifold-based embedding principle (ManifoldE) which could be treated as a well-posed algebraic system that expands point-wise modeling in current models to manifold-wise modeling. Extensive experiments show that the proposed models achieve substantial improvements against the state-of-the-art baselines, particularly for the precise prediction task, and yet maintain high efficiency.",

Specifically, given an entity mentioned in unstructured texts, the task is to link this entity with an entry stored in the existing knowledge base. This is an important task for information extraction. It can serve as a convenient gateway to encyclopedic information, and can greatly improve the web users' experience. Previous learning based solutions mainly focus on classification framework. However, it's more suitable to consider it as a ranking problem. In this paper, we propose a learning to rank algorithm for entity linking. It effectively utilizes the relationship information among the candidates when ranking. The experiment results on the TAC 2009 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The proposed method achieves 18.5% improvement in terms of accuracy over the classification models for those entities which have corresponding entries in the Knowledge Base. The overall performance of the system is also better than that of the state-of-the-art methods.",

Once the utterance comes with less discriminative, it would hard to capture the differences in the classification. Hence, the utterance divided into categories based on their influence in classification. This method is based on assumption that not all parts of utterance would appear balanced to provide good discriminative between them. By weighting parts, which most influence with higher value and vice versa, better distinguishing of utterances is possible. Using genetic algorithm, a new approach for weighting feature is introduced to improve recognition accuracy via exploitation of current recognition system simply by adding weight factor on feature vector.",

How to effectively select and integrate different types of features to improve the biological literature classification performance is the major issue studied in this paper.To efficiently classify the biological literatures, we propose a novel feature value schema TF*ML, features covering from lower level domain independent \"string feature\" to higher level domain dependent \"semantic template feature\", and proper integrations among the features. Compared to our previous approaches, the performance is improved in terms of AUC and F-Score by 11.5% and 8.8% respectively, and outperforms the best performance achieved in BioCreAtIvE 2006.Different types of features possess different discriminative capabilities in literature classification; proper integration of domain independent and dependent features would significantly improve the performance and overcome the over-fitting on data distribution.",

Recommendation techniques primarily based on user or item similarity can suffer from the risk that users cannot get expected information from the over-specified recommendation lists. In this paper, we propose an entropy regularizer to capture the notion of diversity. The entropy regularizer has good properties in that it satisfies monotonicity and submodularity, such that when we combine it with a modular rating set function, we get submodular objective function, which can be maximized approximately by efficient greedy algorithm, with provable constant factor guarantee of optimality. We apply our approach on the top-K prediction problem and evaluate its performance on Movie-Lens data set, which is a standard database containing movie rating data collected from a popular online movie recommender system. We compare our model with the state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. Our experiments show that entropy regularizer effectively captures diversity and hence improves the performance of recommendation task.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal dialogue systems are attracting increasing attention with a more natural and informative way for human-computer interaction. As one of its core components, the belief tracker estimates the user's goal at each step of the dialogue and provides a direct way to validate the ability of dialogue understanding. However, existing studies on belief trackers are largely limited to textual modality, which cannot be easily extended to capture the rich semantics in multimodal systems such as those with product images. For example, in fashion domain, the visual appearance of clothes play a crucial role in understanding the user's intention. In this case, the existing belief trackers may fail to generate accurate belief states for a multimodal dialogue system. \n\nIn this paper, we present the first neural multimodal belief tracker (NMBT) to demonstrate how multimodal evidence can facilitate semantic understanding and dialogue state tracking. Given the multimodal inputs, while applying a textual encoder to represent textual utterances, the model gives special consideration to the semantics revealed in visual modality. It learns concept level fashion semantics by delving deep into image sub-regions and integrating concept probabilities via multiple instance learning. Then in each turn, an adaptive attention mechanism learns to automatically emphasize on different evidence sources of both visual and textual modalities for more accurate dialogue state prediction. We perform extensive evaluation on a multi-turn task-oriented dialogue dataset in fashion domain and the results show that our method achieves superior performance as compared to a wide range of baselines.\n\n",

It is crucial to annotate the detection methods in the literature, since different detection methods shed different degrees of reliability on the reported interactions. However, the diversity of method mentions in the literature makes the automatic extraction quite challenging.In this article, we develop a generative topic model, the Correlated Method-Word model (CMW model) to extract the detection methods from the literature. In the CMW model, we formulate the correlation between the different methods and related words in a probabilistic framework in order to infer the potential methods from the given document. By applying the model on a corpus of 5319 full text documents annotated by the MINT and IntAct databases, we observe promising results, which outperform the best result reported in the BioCreative II challenge evaluation.From the promising experiment results, we can see that the CMW model overcomes the issues caused by the diversity in the method mentions and properly captures the in-depth correlations between the detection methods and related words. The performance outperforming the baseline methods confirms that the dependence assumptions of the model are reasonable and the model is competent for the practical processing.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study Braille word segmentation and transformation of Mandarin Braille to Chinese characters. The former consists of rule, sign and knowledge bases for disambiguation and mistake correction by using adjacent constraints and bi-directional maximal matching in which segmentation precision is better than 99%. The latter can be divided into two stages: Braille to Chinese pinyin (a phonemic Romanization) and pinyin to characters. By incorporating a pinyin knowledge dictionary into the system, we have perfectly solved the problem of ambiguity in the translation from Braille to pinyin and developed a statistical language model based on the transformation of pinyin to characters. By using Viterbi search, we have built a multi-level graph and found the sequence of Chinese characters with maximal likelihood. By using an N -Best algorithm to get the N most likely character sequences and probing into the means of measurement, our correct candidates within the top-five have a further improvement of 3%. By testing on 40,000 Chinese characters for the evaluation of the system performance, our overall translation precision of Braille codes to Chinese characters for common documents arrives at 94.38%; if proper nouns are not considered, our improvement reaches 2%.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose RNN-Capsule, a capsule model based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sentiment analysis. For a given problem, one capsule is built for each sentiment category e.g., 'positive' and 'negative'. Each capsule has an attribute, a state, and three modules: representation module, probability module, and reconstruction module. The attribute of a capsule is the assigned sentiment category. Given an instance encoded in hidden vectors by a typical RNN, the representation module builds capsule representation by the attention mechanism. Based on capsule representation, the probability module computes the capsule's state probability. A capsule's state is active if its state probability is the largest among all capsules for the given instance, and inactive otherwise. On two benchmark datasets (i.e., Movie Review and Stanford Sentiment Treebank) and one proprietary dataset (i.e., Hospital Feedback), we show that RNN-Capsule achieves state-of-the-art performance on sentiment classification. More importantly, without using any linguistic knowledge, RNN-Capsule is capable of outputting words with sentiment tendencies reflecting capsules' attributes. The words well reflect the domain specificity of the dataset.\n\n",

However, this problem has not been studied in large-scale conversation generation so far. In this paper, we propose Emotional Chatting Machine (ECM) that can generate appropriate responses not only in content (relevant and grammatical) but also in emotion (emotionally consistent). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. ECM addresses the factor using three new mechanisms that respectively (1) models the high-level abstraction of emotion expressions by embedding emotion categories, (2) captures the change of implicit internal emotion states, and (3) uses explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary. Experiments show that the proposed model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion.",

The current photo annotation and management systems suffer from two crucial problems. One is the expression of semantic knowledge; the other is the way of photo annotation. Aiming at the former problem, this paper proposes to utilize ontology to organize the domain knowledge and provide formal, explicit and conceptual annotation. Meanwhile, a dual-level semi-automatic annotation approach is also proposed to resolve the latter problem. The rough annotation layer provides preliminary annotation by automatically extracting some semantic concepts from photo titles/texts, time concepts from EXIF metadata, and photo classification concepts from the result of face detection algorithms. The accurate annotation layer provides more detailed annotation by allowing users to modify, delete and add the annotation information freely. An ontology based photo management system OntoAlbum is implemented in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is very effective and promising.",

        "abstract": "As online community question answering (cQA) portals like Yahoo! Answers1 and Baidu Zhidao2 have attracted over hundreds of millions of questions, how to utilize these questions and accordant answers becomes increasingly important for cQA websites. Prior approaches focus on using information retrieval techniques to provide a ranked list of questions based on their similarities to the query. Due to the high variance of question quality and answer quality, users have to spend lots of time on finding the truly best answers from retrieved results. In this paper, we develop an answer retrieval and summarization system which directly provides an accurate and comprehensive answer summary instead of a list of similar questions to user\u2019s query. To fully explore the information of relations between queries and questions, between questions and answers, and between answers and sentences, we propose a new probabilistic scoring model to distinguish high-quality answers from low-quality answers. By fully exploiting these relations, we summarize answers using a maximum coverage model. Experiment results on the data extracted from Chinese cQA websites demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.",

To extract the opinion oriented answers, we need to consider both topic relevance and opinion sentiment issues. Current solutions to this problem are mostly ad-hoc combinations of question topic information and opinion information. In this paper, we propose an Opinion PageRank model and an Opinion HITS model to fully explore the information from different relations among questions and answers, answers and answers, and topics and opinions. By fully exploiting these relations, the experiment results show that our proposed algorithms outperform several state of the art baselines on benchmark data set.

        "abstract": "Traditional discriminative classification method makes little attempt to reveal the probabilistic structure and the correlation within both input and output spaces. In the scenario of multi-label classification, most of the classifiers simply assume the predefined classes are independently distributed, which would definitely hinder the classification performance when there are intrinsic correlations between the classes. In this article, we propose a generative probabilistic model, the Correlated Labeling Model (CoL Model), to formulate the correlation between different classes. The CoL model is presented to capture the correlation between classes and the underlying structures via the latent random variables in a supervised manner. We develop a variational procedure to approximate the posterior distribution and employ the EM algorithm for the empirical Bayes parameter estimation. In our evaluations, the proposed model achieved promising results on various data sets.",

Despite its success, MNB-EM is not stable, and may succeed or fail to improve MNB. We believe that this is because MNB-EM lacks the ability to preserve the class distribution on words. In this paper, we propose a novel method to augment MNB-EM by leveraging the word-level statistical constraint to preserve the class distribution on words. The word-level statistical constraints are further converted to constraints on document posteriors generated by MNB-EM. Experiments demonstrate that our method can consistently improve MNB-EM, and outperforms state-of-art baselines remarkably.",

Our approach selects reviews that comprehensively talk about a feature of a service by using information distance of the reviews on the feature. The rating estimation of the feature for these selected reviews using machine learning techniques provides more accurate results than that for other reviews. The average of these estimated feature ratings also better represents an accurate overall rating for the feature of the service, which provides useful feedback for other users to choose their satisfactory services.",

        "abstract": "Traditional sentiment analysis mainly considers binary classifications of reviews, but in many real-world sentiment classification problems, non-binary review ratings are more useful. This is especially true when consumers wish to compare two products, both of which are not negative. Previous work has addressed this problem by extracting various features from the review text for learning a predictor. Since the same word may have different sentiment effects when used by different reviewers on different products, we argue that it is necessary to model such reviewer and product dependent effects in order to predict review ratings more accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to incorporate reviewer and product information into the text based learner for rating prediction. The reviewer, product and text features are modeled as a three-dimension tensor. Tensor factorization techniques can then be employed to reduce the data sparsity problems. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which has a significant improvement compared to state of the art methods, especially for reviews with unpopular products and inactive reviewers.",

Identification of specific binding peptides is critical for immunology research and vaccine design. A variety of methods such as HMM and ANN have been applied to predict peptides that can bind to MHC class I molecules and therefore the number of candidate binders for experimental assay can be largely reduced. However, it is a more complex process to predict peptides that bind to MHC class II molecules. In this paper, we present a SVM-based method for the prediction of MHC class II binding peptides by using string kernel. The proposed method adopts a special string kernel to compute the similarity between biological sequences with various lengths and experimental results show that our method outperforms other reported approaches. The proposed method does not require that sequences be aligned to the same length, and hence is easily employed for other prediction tasks. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.",

Though a variety of neural network models have been proposed very recently, however, previous models either depend on expensive phrase-level annotation, whose performance drops substantially when trained with only sentence-level annotation; or do not fully employ linguistic resources (e.g., sentiment lexicons, negation words, intensity words), thus not being able to produce linguistically coherent representations. In this paper, we propose simple models trained with sentence-level annotation, but also attempt to generating linguistically coherent representations by employing regularizers that model the linguistic role of sentiment lexicons, negation words, and intensity words. Results show that our models are effective to capture the sentiment shifting effect of sentiment, negation, and intensity words, while still obtain competitive results without sacrificing the modelsu0027 simplicity.",

The proposed system is designed as an effective neural network by adding confidence back propagation and input modification (feedback) to the ANN model and the learning algorithm, so that preprocessing and recognition parts are integrated closely. The feedback signal is acquired through the difference of supposed output (predefined) and real output, and is back propagated to modify the input image signal in the feature space using the gradient descent algorithm. The modification can be considered as a step of the preprocessing phase in the whole system architecture, which can get rid of many kinds of noise showed in the experiment part of this paper. In order to get rid of the interference of the models, specified feedback network is trained for various models. During the recognition phase, only the candidate models in the predefined similarity set are processed by the feedback network to decrease the computational complexity. The final result is given by the model with minimum feedback cost. The proof of the convergence of the feedback algorithm is presented in this paper, and detailed experiments are made on sample sets with different characteristics, which showed that the error rate in such result feedback neural network architecture can be greatly reduced and the robustness to environmental noise be increased.",

While human experts could easily identify spam web pages, the manual evaluating process of a large number of pages is still time consuming and cost consuming. To assist manual evaluation, we propose an algorithm to assign spam values to web pages and semi-automatically select potential spam web pages. We first manually select a small set of spam pages as seeds. Then, based on the link structure of the web, the initial R-SpamRank values assigned to the seed pages propagate through links and distribute among the whole web page set. After sorting the pages according to their R-SpamRank values, the pages with high values are selected. Our experiments and analyses show that the algorithm is highly successful in identifying spam pages, which gains a precision of 99.1% in the top 10,000 web pages with the highest R-SpamRank values.",

To cope with information overload, online news media publishes timelines for continuously developing news topics. However, the timeline summary does not show the relationship of storylines, and is not intuitive for readers to comprehend the development of a complex news topic. In this paper, we study a novel problem of exploring the interactions of storylines in a news topic. An interaction of two storylines is signified by informative news events that play a key role in both storylines. Storyline interactions can indicate key phases of a news topic, and reveal the latent connections among various aspects of the story. We address the coherence between news articles which is not considered in traditional similarity-based methods, and discover salient storyline interactions to form a clear, global picture of the news topic. User preference can be naturally integrated into our method to generate query-specific results. Comprehensive experiments on ten news topics show the effectiveness of our method over alternative approaches.",

In this paper, we optimize the Johnson's Heuristic algorithm for rough set reduction, and then propose an aggressive feature selection method for text categorization. This method integrates the advantages of knowledge reduction in rough set (RS) theory and the conventional feature selection methods information gain (IG) and document frequency (DF). It is the first time that the rough set based feature selection method is experimented on the large-scale data set Reuters. And the results show that the proposed method can obtain higher categorization accuracy than IG and DF with much fewer features. In addition, comparing with the original rough set reduction, the proposed method reduces the computational time significantly. For the Reuters dataset, several discretization widths are adopted, and with our method, the quantities of features are reduced by 93.5%, 88.4% with only 0.61%, 0.13% decreases of F1 measure respectively.",

For example, the visual similarity based search has poor precision and lacks for semantic information, while the text-based retrieval is only lexically motivated and those lexicons are not organized well. In one word, systems that really support intelligent retrieval are rare. In order to overcome these shortcomings, an ontology based approach is proposed for photo management, which is conceptual motivated. The approach is implemented in the OntoAlbumsystem. When a photo is imported into the database, the system automatically creates an instance of it. Then the user annotates the photo with concepts of ontology. Finally, by clicking on an instance of concepts in the ontology, the user can find all the photos related to the instance through ontology inference. Ontology provides a formal, explicit and conceptual annotation as well as an effective inference query. It makes intelligent retrieval possible in the photo management system. Experiments on the OntoAlbumsystem show that the proposed approach is very effective and promising.",

The proposed text summarization system selects and ranks sentences from multiple MEDLINE abstracts by exploiting gene-specific information and similarity relationships between sentences. We evaluate our system on a large dataset of 7,294 human genes and 187,628 MEDLINE abstracts using Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), a widely used automatic evaluation metric in the text summarization community. Two baseline methods are used for comparison. Experimental results show that our system significantly outperforms the other two methods with regard to all ROUGE metrics.

        "abstract": "Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model is one of the most important Bayesian nonparametric models owing to its efficiency of inference and flexibility for various applications. A fundamental assumption made by DPM model is that all data items are generated from a single, shared DP. This assumption, however, is restrictive in many practical settings where samples are generated from a collection of dependent DPs, each associated with a point in some covariate space. For example, documents in the proceedings of a conference are organized by year, or photos may be tagged and recorded with GPS locations. We present a general method for constructing dependent Dirichlet processes (DP) on arbitrary covariate space. The approach is based on restricting and projecting a DP defined on a space of continuous functions with different domains, which results in a collection of dependent random measures, each associated with a point in covariate space and is marginally DP distributed. The constructed collection of dependent DPs can be used as a nonparametric prior of infinite dynamic mixture models, which allow each mixture component to appear/disappear and vary in a subspace of covariate space. Furthermore, we discuss choices of base distributions of functions in a variety of settings as a flexible method to control dependencies. In addition, we develop an efficient Gibbs sampler for model inference where all underlying random measures are integrated out. Finally, experiment results on temporal modeling and spatial modeling datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in modeling dynamic mixture models on different types of covariates.",

We participated in the Question Answering (QA) track, and the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) track. For question answering track, we enhanced the traditional question answering system by sentiment lexicon based opinion analysis. The rigid list questions are divided into two categories based on their answer types. And two snippet extraction approaches are proposed to answer squishy list questions. For RTE track, we design different strategies to recognize true entailment and false entailment. The similarity between hypothesis and text is measured to recognize true entailment. We detect the exact entity and relation mismatch to recognize the false entailment. The evaluation results show that the proposed approaches are very effective for the QA and RTE tasks. In this year's Text Analysis Conference, we participated in two tracks: the Question Answering (QA) track and the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) track. This paper reports on our two developed systems for these two tracks. The TAC 2008 QA track is different from previous TREC QA. It focuses on finding answers to opinion questions. We develop the opinion question answering system by enhancing our past participated system QUANTA(3) with lexicon based sentiment analysis. We not only consider the topic relevance, but also pay attention to the sentiment match between question and answers. By analyzing the rigid list questions, we divide all the rigid list questions into two categories: the Opinion Holder Rigid List questions and Other Types Rigid List questions. Opinion Holder Rigid List questions refer to the questions whose answers are blog nicknames or blog holders. Other Types Rigid List questions refer to the questions whose answers are same to traditional factoid questions, such as person names, cities etc. The different strategies are designed for these two types of rigid list questions. We also propose two snippet extraction approaches to answer",

In this paper, we address the issue of generating responses that are coherent to a pre-specified agent profile. We design a model consisting of three modules: a profile detector to decide whether a post should be responded using the profile and which key should be addressed, a bidirectional decoder to generate responses forward and backward starting from a selected profile value, and a position detector that predicts a word position from which decoding should start given a selected profile value. We show that general conversation data from social media can be used to generate profile-coherent responses.

One main obstacle is what said \"robustness\". This paper focus on one popular idea in antagonizing speech system vulnerability-channel normalization, and presents a new normalization algorithm MLCN(multi-layer channel normalization), which exploits the recursive compensation progress in two domains (spectral domain and cepstral domain) to depress the noise and channel distortion, so that the more robust speech representation for the following processing is achieved. A new frequency-dynamic feature extraction algorithm is also proposed due to the introduction of MLCN, which allows dynamic information integrated in the final feature vectors.

While huge in size, Freebase lacks context for most entities, such as the descriptive text and hyperlinks in Wikipedia, which are useful for disambiguation. Instead, we leverage two features of Freebase, namely the naturally disambiguated mention phrases (aka aliases) and the rich taxonomy, to perform disambiguation in an iterative manner. Specifically, we explore both generative and discriminative models for each iteration. Experiments on 2, 430, 707 English sentences and 33, 743 Freebase entities show the effectiveness of the two features, where 90% accuracy can be reached without any labeled data. We also show that discriminative models with proposed split training strategy is robust against over fitting problem, and constantly outperforms the generative ones.",

A global speaker model is established to represent the universal features of speech. Likelihood score is subtracted by the score produced by this model so that the common factors of speech are removed and the differences between speakers are brought into prominence. Compared to the conventional method and popular likelihood score normalization approach, the proposed technique decreases the equal error rate significantly, and the verification speed is fast.",

Based on an interesting linguistic observation, Loose N-gram feature, defined as co-occurring words within limited range, is quite different from traditional features, such as words, phrases or n-grams. Not only retaining useful context information, this kind of feature also has considerable classification ability. The features generated by our algorithm have acceptable statistical characteristics, thus can effectively avoid the sparseness problem. Experiment results show that the Loose N-gram feature is helpful and promising in statistical text categorization systems, especially for the categorization tasks which rely on more semantic information.

Many of them require significant domain-specific knowledge to build the patterns by hand, or a large amount of labeled data to learn the patterns automatically. In this paper, a semi- supervised model is presented to combine both unlabeled and labeled data for the pattern learning procedure. First, a large amount of unlabeled data is used to generate a raw pattern set. Then it is refined in the evaluating phase by incorporating the domain knowledge provided by a relatively small labeled data. Comparative results show that labeled data, when used in conjunction with the inexpensive unlabeled data, can considerably improve the learning accuracy.",

In this paper, we propose a new method for dialogue management. The scheme uses finite state automata based on slot-features to establish the whole structure. In the automata, a two-dimensional state feature is proposed and state reduction is applied. State set and action set are divided into subsets; hence it becomes easier to control. The most distinctive aspect is that two strategy control functions are used to implement the strategy control in the verification as well as in the request. Furthermore, an intention-layered structure is proposed and applied to the topic detection and switch, which work for multi-topics applications. The structure is portable and feasible to be extended. At last, experiments show that our method has good performance.",

Identification of specific binding peptides is critical for immunology research and vaccine design. However, accurate prediction of peptides binding to HLA molecules is challenging. A variety of methods such as HMM and ANN have been applied to predict peptides that can bind to HLA class I molecules and therefore the number of candidate binders for experimental assay can be largely reduced. However, it is a more complex process to predict peptides that bind to HLA class II molecules. In this paper, we proposed a kernel-based method, integrating the BLOSUM matrix with string kernel to form a new kernel. The substitution score between amino acids in BLOSUM matrix is incorporated into computing the similarity between two binding peptides, which exhibits more biological meaning over traditional string kernels. The promising results of this approach show advantages than other methods.",

In this research, we analyze different sources and strategies of protein name classification, and developed integrated strategies that incorporate advantages from rule-based, dictionary-based and statistical-based method. In rule-based method, terms and knowledge of protein nomenclature that provide strong cue for protein name are used. In dictionary-based method, a set of rules for curating protein name dictionary are used. These terms and dictionaries are combined with our developed features into a statistical-based classifier. Our developed features are comprised of word shape features and unigram & bi-gram features.

        "abstract": "Motivation: An enormous number of protein--protein interaction relationships are buried in millions of research articles published over the years, and the number is growing. Rediscovering them automatically is a challenging bioinformatics task. Solutions to this problem also reach far beyond bioinformatics. Results: We study a new approach that involves automatically discovering English expression patterns, optimizing them and using them to extract protein--protein interactions. In a sister paper, we described how to generate English expression patterns related to protein--protein interactions, and this approach alone has already achieved precision and recall rates significantly higher than those of other automatic systems. This paper continues to present our theory, focusing on how to improve the patterns. A minimum description length (MDL)-based pattern-optimization algorithm is designed to reduce and merge patterns. This has significantly increased generalization power, and hence the recall and precision rates, as confirmed by ourexperiments.

Previous works usually extract aspect and opinion words by leveraging association between a single pair of aspect and opinion word[5] [14] [9] [4][11], but the structure of aspect and opinion word clusters has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we investigate the aspect-opinion association structure, and propose a \\\"first clustering, then extracting\\\" unsupervised model to leverage properties of the structure for sentiment extraction. For the clustering purpose, we formalise a novel concept syntactic distribution consistency as soft constraint in the framework of posterior regularization; for the extraction purpose, we extract aspect and opinion words based on cluster-cluster association. In comparison to traditional word-word association, we show that cluster-cluster association is a much stronger signal to distinguish aspect (opinion) words from non-aspect (non-opinion) words. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the advantages against state-of-the-art baselines.",

In this paper, we explore a new concept for aspect-level review analysis, latent sentiment explanations, which are defined as a set of informative aspect-specific sentences whose polarities are consistent with that of the review. In other words, sentiment explanations best represent a review in terms of both aspect and polarity. We formulate the problem as a structure learning problem, and sentiment explanations are modeled with latent variables. Training samples are automatically identified through a set of pre-defined aspect signature terms (i.e., without manual annotation on samples), which we term the way weakly supervised. Our major contributions lie in two folds: first, we formalize the use of aspect signature terms as weak supervision in a structural learning framework, which remarkably promotes aspect-level analysis; second, the performance of aspect analysis and document-level sentiment classification are mutually enhanced through joint modeling. The proposed method is evaluated on restaurant and hotel reviews respectively, and experimental results demonstrate promising performance in both document-level and aspect-level sentiment analysis.",

Recently, Story Cloze Test has been introduced as a new task of machine reading comprehension, i.e., selecting a correct ending from two candidate endings given a four-sentence story context. Most existing methods for Story Cloze Test are essentially matching-based that operate by comparing an individual ending with a given context, therefore suffering from the evidence bias issue: both candidate endings can obtain supporting evidence from the story context, which misleads the classifier to choose an incorrect ending. To address this issue, we present a novel idea to improve story comprehension by utilizing the hints that are obtained through comparing two candidate endings. The proposed model firstly anticipates a feature vector for a possible ending solely based on the context, and then refines the feature prediction using the hints which encode the difference between two candidates. The candidate ending whose feature vector is more similar to the predicted ending vector is regarded as correct. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can alleviate the evidence bias issue and improve story comprehension.",

        "abstract": "Recently there have been many information extraction tasks applied to the biomedical domain, some of which contribute to extract protein-protein interactions from biomedical texts. This paper presents a new method for automatic pattern acquisition to extract protein interactions. The system automatically generates patterns by aligning sequences of tags of sentences from unlabeled corpus. To obtain a high tagging accuracy, we propose a morphology-based tagging method with a pre-tagging strategy for Brill's tagger. Our method differs from the previous pattern acquisition algorithms in the ways: first, it does not need to provide any seed word or pattern before the algorithm runs; second, we do not apply any parsing algorithm. Lastly, our method, which is based on dynamic programming, is fast.",

We propose a new machine learning framework based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). It can employ rich features to jointly extract positive opinions, negative opinions and object features for review sentences. The linguistic structure can be naturally integrated into model representation. Besides linear-chain structure, we also investigate conjunction structure and syntactic tree structure in this framework. Through extensive experiments on movie review and product review data sets, we show that structure-aware models outperform many state-of-the-art approaches to review mining.",

        "abstract": "Precise prediction of the probability that users click on ads plays a key role in sponsored search. State-of-the-art sponsored search systems typically employ a machine learning approach to conduct click prediction. While paying much attention to extracting useful features and building effective models, previous studies have overshadowed seemingly less obvious but essentially important challenges in terms of data sampling. To fulfill the learning objective of click prediction, it is not only necessary to ensure that the sampled training data implies the similar input distribution compared with the real world one, but also to guarantee that the sampled training data yield the consistent conditional output distribution, i.e. click-through rate (CTR), with the real world data. However, due to the sparseness of clicks in sponsored search, it is a bit contradictory to address these two challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we first take a theoretical analysis to reveal this sampling dilemma, followed by a thorough data analysis which demonstrates that the straightforward random sampling method may not be effective to balance these two kinds of consistency in sampling dilemma simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose a new sampling algorithm which can succeed in retaining the consistency between the sampled data and real world in terms of both input distribution and conditional output distribution. Large scale evaluations on the click-through logs from a commercial search engine demonstrate that this new sampling algorithm can effectively address the sampling dilemma. Further experiments illustrate that, by using the training data obtained by our new sampling algorithm, we can learn the model with much higher accuracy in click prediction.",

        "abstract": "Convolution kernels, constructed by convolution of sub-kernels defined on sub-structures of composite objects, are widely used in classification, where one important issue is to choose adequate sub-structures, particularly for objects such as trees, graphs, and sequences. In this paper, we study the problem of sub-structure selection for constructing convolution kernels by combining heterogeneous kernels defined on different levels of substructures. Sub-kernels defined on different levels of sub-structures are combined together to incorporate their individual strengths because each level of sub-structure reflects its own angle to view the object. Two types of combination, linear and polynomial combination, are investigated. We analyze from the perspective of feature space why combined kernels exhibit potential advantages. Experiments indicate that the method will be helpful for combining kernels defined on arbitrary levels of sub-structures.",

The Markov logic network (MLN) incorporates local linguistic features and captures global dependencies between word deletion operations. The MLN based method combines the advantages of discriminative learning and integer linear programming by incorporating a rich set of features and expressing global constraints as logic formulae. Tests on both written and spoken news corpora show that this approach is superior to state-of-the-art methods. For similar compression rates, this method achieves a much higher F-score of dependency relations in comparison with human compressions.",

For example, in question answering, finding similar relations between questions needs paraphrase detection, also it is widely used in information retrieval, machine translation, document clustering, etc. Traditional solutions are mainly divided to two types. One is based on bag of words, which only considers the words in the sentences and similarity degrees between words. The other type is based on word embedding and deep neural networks, which learns word vectors to sentence vectors in deep models, in these models, deep layers may represent deep information in a sentence like phrase information and syntactic information, but these models may also lose some sentence information. We proposed a new method that considers word similarity and also directly uses dependency relations in sentences. We train our model in a Chinese text corpus. By working out dependency relation similarities and word similarities, we decide whether a sentence is a paraphrase of another one.",

        "abstract": "Handwritten Chinese Address Recognition describes a difficult yet important pattern recognition task. There are three difficulties in this problem: (1) Handwritten address is often of free styles and of high variations, resulting in inevitable segmentation errors. (2) The number of Chinese characters is large, leading low recognition rate for single Chinese characters. (3) Chinese address is usually irregular, i.e., different persons may write the same address in different formats. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and hybrid approach for solving all these three difficulties. Aiming to solve (1) and (2), we adopt an enhanced holistic scheme to recognize the whole image of words (defined as a place name) instead of that of single characters. This facilitates the usage of address knowledge and avoids the difficult single character segmentation problem as well. In order to attack (3), we propose a hybrid approach that combines the word-based language model and the holistic word matching scheme. Therefore, it can deal with various irregular address. We provide theoretical justifications, outline the detailed steps, and perform a series of experiments. The experimental results on various real address demonstrate the advantages of our novel approach.",

        "abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs) make recommendation for users by capturing their preference from historical behaviors. However, emphasizing too much on the perspective of prediction precision leads to the problem of preference overfitting, which blockades the user from touching a wide range of new but potentially interesting items. Usually, it would be beneficial for the system to attempt suitable extensions beyond usersu0027 existing preferences already expressed in the recommender system. Traditional recommender systems concentrate much more on what a user had explored than what she/he is yet to explore. Too much attention to the precision of recommendation can lead to a preference overfitting problem. Users have the need for certain amount of extension based on the existing preference. In this paper, we investigate how novel items should be recommended given the useru0027s preference which is modeled from her/his historical behaviors. Inspired by Wundt Curve, a famous law in cognition psychology field, we propose an idea of Personal Exploration Preference (PEP) model to capture the user preference from another perspective, the strength of aspiration to explore. Then we integrate PEP model into traditional recommendation algorithms. Finally,we experimentally evaluate the improvement of PEP model to traditional algorithms on HetRec2011 dataset. Experiment results show that, on the Top-N recommendation task, PEP model can effectively capture user preference of exploration and improve recommendation quality significantly.",

Extracting them automatically is a challenging bioinformatics task. Although previous works have shown that supervised learning methods are superior for this task, the performance still relies on manually labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a solution to learn from plenty of labeled protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, and utilize the learned knowledge to help the extraction of GDA. In particular, a support vector machine modified for corpus weighting (SVM-CW) was applied to weight labeled PPI data, in order to allow knowledge to be effectively transferred from the PPI domain data to the GDA domain. The experimental results show that our solution can make full use of labeled PPI data and improve the performance of GDA extraction.",

        "abstract": "We developed a new literature mining paradigm with the ultimate goal of enabling knowledge discovery in molecular association profiles generated from literature and prior knowledge. We show how to implement the paradigm by building a prototype literature mining framework and performing molecule-bioGist association mining. The framework consists of two modules. The first module, Textual Data Mining, takes the synonym-expanded disease-related molecule names and outputs a list of bioGist list. The second module, Structured Data Mining, takes two inputs, initial disease-related molecular query terms and extracted bioGist list from the first module, and outputs a molecule-bioGist association matrix. Our approach is novel because biomedical literature mining is used here not only as an \"information retrieval\" tool, but also as a \"hypothesis generation and validation\" platform. We applied the framework to a molecular pharmacology study of breast cancer. Based on 214 breast cancer-related proteins, 429,067 MEDLINE abstracts were retrieved, and 4,491 drug compounds were identified as bioGists. We evaluated 172 hydrocarbons in the above bioGist list, and found that more than 82.5% hydrocarbons were verified to be related to breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 were found to have similar profiles in drug compound studies, whereas \"doxorubicin\", \"etoposide\", and \"paclitaxel\" were identified to have similar pharmacological profiles to treat breast cancer.",

        "title": "Learning to Collaborate: Multi-Scenario Ranking via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.",
        "abstract": "Ranking is a fundamental and widely studied problem in scenarios such as search, advertising, and recommendation. However, joint optimization for multi-scenario ranking, which aims to improve the overall performance of several ranking strategies in different scenarios, is rather untouched. Separately optimizing each individual strategy has two limitations. The first one is lack of collaboration between scenarios meaning that each strategy maximizes its own objective but ignores the goals of other strategies, leading to a sub-optimal overall performance. The second limitation is the inability of modeling the correlation between scenarios meaning that independent optimization in one scenario only uses its own user data but ignores the context in other scenarios. In this paper, we formulate multi-scenario ranking as a fully cooperative, partially observable, multi-agent sequential decision problem. We propose a novel model named Multi-Agent Recurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient (MA-RDPG) which has a communication component for passing messages, several private actors (agents) for making actions for ranking, and a centralized critic for evaluating the overall performance of the co-working actors. Each scenario is treated as an agent (actor). Agents collaborate with each other by sharing a global action-value function (the critic) and passing messages that encodes historical information across scenarios. The model is evaluated with online settings on a large E-commerce platform. Results show that the proposed model exhibits significant improvements against baselines in terms of the overall performance.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Advertising (ad for short) keyword suggestion is important for sponsored search to improve online advertising and increase search revenue. There are two common challenges in this task. First, the keyword bidding problem: hot ad keywords are very expensive for most of the advertisers because more advertisers are bidding on more popular keywords, while unpopular keywords are difficult to discover. As a result, most ads have few chances to be presented to the users. Second, the inefficient ad impression issue: a large proportion of search queries, which are unpopular yet relevant to many ad keywords, have no ads presented on their search result pages. Existing retrieval-based or matching-based methods either deteriorate the bidding competition or are unable to suggest novel keywords to cover more queries, which leads to inefficient ad impressions. \n\nTo address the above issues, this work investigates to use generative neural networks for keyword generation in sponsored search. Given a purchased keyword (a word sequence) as input, our model can generate a set of keywords that are not only relevant to the input but also satisfy the domain constraint which enforces that the domain category of a generated keyword is as expected. Furthermore, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to adaptively utilize domain-specific information in keyword generation. Offline evaluation shows that the proposed model can generate keywords that are diverse, novel, relevant to the source keyword, and accordant with the domain constraint. Online evaluation shows that generative models can improve coverage (COV), click-through rate (CTR), and revenue per mille (RPM) substantially in sponsored search.\n\n",

In this paper, we proposed a novel method RCRank to jointly compute concept-concept relatedness and concept-category relatedness base on the assumption that information carried in concept-concept links and concept-category links can mutually reinforce each other. Different from previous work, RCRank can not only find semantically related concepts but also interpret their relations by categories. Experimental results on concept recommendation and relation interpretation show that our method substantially outperforms classical methods.",

        "abstract": "Clustering sentiment phrases in product reviews is convenient for us to get the most important information about one product directly through thousands of reviews. There are mainly two components in a sentiment phrase, the aspect word and the opinion word. We need to cluster these two parts simultaneously. Although several methods have been proposed to cluster words or phrases, limited work has been done on clustering two-dimensional sentiment phrases. In this paper, we apply a two-sided hidden Markov random field HMRF model on this task. We use the approach of constrained co-clustering with some priori knowledge, in a semi-supervised setting. Experimental results on sentiment phrases extracted from about 0.7\u00ef\u00be\u00bfmillion mobile phone reviews show that this method is promising for this task and our method outperforms baselines remarkably.",

        "abstract": "Existing relation classification methods that rely on distant supervision assume that a bag of sentences mentioning an entity pair are all describing a relation for the entity pair. Such methods, performing classification at the bag level, cannot identify the mapping between a relation and a sentence, and largely suffers from the noisy labeling problem. In this paper, we propose a novel model for relation classification at the sentence level from noisy data. The model has two modules: an instance selector and a relation classifier. The instance selector chooses high-quality sentences with reinforcement learning and feeds the selected sentences into the relation classifier, and the relation classifier makes sentence level prediction and provides rewards to the instance selector. The two modules are trained jointly to optimize the instance selection and relation classification processes. Experiment results show that our model can deal with the noise of data effectively and obtains better performance for relation classification at the sentence level.",

MSPM can overcome two apparent defects of SPM: the first is the lack of the description of time information, and the second is that the effect of short duration segment is suppressed by that of long one in the calculation of model likelihood. The Gamma distribution of duration and the weighted geometric means of observation probability in each segment are involved in MSPM. The experiments show a large improvement of precision by MSPM over SPM. MSPM costs less computation load than HMM, requiring less training data as well.",

        "abstract": "Dialogue management (DM) decides the next action of a dialogue system according to the current dialogue state, and thus plays a central role in task-oriented dialogue systems. Since dialogue management requires to have access to not only local utterances, but also the global semantics of the entire dialogue session, modeling the long-range history information is a critical issue. To this end, we propose a novel Memory-Augmented Dialogue management model (MAD) which employs a memory controller and two additional memory structures, i.e., a slot-value memory and an external memory. The slot-value memory tracks the dialogue state by memorizing and updating the values of semantic slots (for instance, cuisine, price, and location), and the external memory augments the representation of hidden states of traditional recurrent neural networks through storing more context information. To update the dialogue state efficiently, we also propose slot-level attention on user utterances to extract specific semantic information for each slot. Experiments show that our model can obtain state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing baselines.",

        "abstract": "Phrase/Sentence representation is one of the most important problems in natural language processing. Many neural network models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recursive Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been proposed to learn representations of phrase/sentence, however, rich syntactic knowledge has not been fully explored when composing a longer text from its shorter constituent words. In most traditional models, only word embeddings are utilized to compose phrase/sentence representations, while the syntactic information of words is yet to be explored. In this article, we discover that encoding syntactic knowledge (part-of-speech tag) in neural networks can enhance sentence/phrase representation. Specifically, we propose to learn tag-specific composition functions and tag embeddings in recursive neural networks, and propose to utilize POS tags to control the gates of tree-structured LSTM networks. We evaluate these models on two benchmark datasets for sentiment classification, and demonstrate that improvements can be obtained with such syntactic knowledge encoded.",

        "abstract": "In the past few years, sentiment analysis and opinion mining becomes a popular and important task. These studies all assume that their opinion resources are real and trustful. However, they may encounter the faked opinion or opinion spam problem. In this paper, we study this issue in the context of our product review mining system. On product review site, people may write faked reviews, called review spam, to promote their products, or defame their competitors' products. It is important to identify and filter out the review spam. Previous work only focuses on some heuristic rules, such as helpfulness voting, or rating deviation, which limits the performance of this task. In this paper, we exploit machine learning methods to identify review spam. Toward the end, we manually build a spam collection from our crawled reviews. We first analyze the effect of various features in spam identification. We also observe that the review spammer consistently writes spam. This provides us another view to identify review spam: we can identify if the author of the review is spammer. Based on this observation, we provide a twoview semi-supervised method, co-training, to exploit the large amount of unlabeled data. The experiment results show that our proposed method is effective. Our designed machine learning methods achieve significant improvements in comparison to the heuristic baselines.",

        "abstract": "Learning for sentence re-writing is a fundamental task in natural language processing and information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new class of kernel functions, referred to as string re-writing kernel, to address the problem. A string re-writing kernel measures the similarity between two pairs of strings, each pair representing re-writing of a string. It can capture the lexical and structural similarity between two pairs of sentences without the need of constructing syntactic trees. We further propose an instance of string re-writing kernel which can be computed efficiently. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve better results than state-of-the-art methods on two sentence re-writing learning tasks: paraphrase identification and recognizing textual entailment.",

Based on the opinion mentioned above, and from the view of layer outline, this paper presents a formalized method to describe the features of Chinese characters, a conception of the layer outline of Chinese characters, and a relevant algorithm of local optimal match.

We propose a faster robust learning algorithm of EAMNN and a new error cost function based on weighted sum of standard output error and Hamming distance of output error, and the additional derivatives term of first hidden layer neural activation functions. The fast back propagation training is based on a modified steepest descent method derived. By changing the error function to update weights according to output error, thus it speeds up significantly training speed of the MLP and BAM. The algorithm can force the hidden-layer activation to be saturated to reduce sensitivity of the output values to input variables effectively. It improves robustness on classification performance, increases associative memory ability and accelerates training speed of EAMNN. The experiments verify that it is more powerful than other networks. Then we proposed a two level tree structure modular EAMNN for large-set pattern classification.",

Improving error energy function, updating the changing of weights according to size of output error, can increase training speed. From back propagation along layer, to average overlap part of back propagation error of first hidden layer along flame, the training samples from a little to many gradually, convergence speed increases must faster. To multi-class phonemic modular TDNNs, we improve the architecture of Waibel's modular networks, and get an optimum modular TDNNs (OMNNs) of tree structure to accelerate its learning, its training time is less than Waibel's modular TDNNs.

The hybrid algorithm's recognition rate is higher than that of Polak-Ribieve algorithm and convergence BP for test data, its training time is less than that of Fletcher-Reeves algorithm and far less than that of convergence BP, and it has a less complicated and stronger robustness to real speech data.",

Braille word segmentation consists of the rules base, the signs base of segmentation and knowledge base for disambiguation and mistakes. By using adjacency constraints and bidirectional maximum matching with a dictionary, our system's segmentation precision is better than 99% for the common text. By incorporating a pinyin knowledge dictionary into the system, we perfectly solved the problem of ambiguity in the translation from Braille to pinyin and developed a statistical language model based on the transformation of pinyin into characters. By using a multi-knowledge base to carry out the disambiguation process for each pinyin sentence, we built a multi-level graph and used a Viterbi search to find the sequence of Chinese characters with maximum likelihood, and used an N-best algorithm to get the N most likely character sequences. The experimental results show that the system's overall precision for translation from Braille codes to Chinese characters is 94.38%",

However, it is more useful to present ratings of product features (such as price, battery, screen, and lens of digital cameras) to help customers make effective purchase decisions. Unfortunately, only a very few web sites have collected feature ratings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accurately estimate feature ratings of products.

In this paper we propose a novel method to address this problem. Given a set of articles for a given news topic, the proposed method models theme variation through time and identifies the breakpoints, which are time points when decisive changes occur. For each breakpoint, a brief summary is automatically constructed based on articles associated with the particular time point. Summaries are then ordered chronologically to form a timeline overview of the news topic. In this fashion, readers can easily track various news topics efficiently. We have conducted experiments on 15 popular topics in 2010. Empirical experiments show the effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over other approaches.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge representation is a long-history topic in AI, which is very important. A variety of models have been proposed for knowledge graph embedding, which projects symbolic entities and relations into continuous vector space. However, most related methods merely focus on the data-fitting of knowledge graph, and ignore the interpretable semantic expression. Thus, traditional embedding methods are not friendly for applications that require semantic analysis, such as question answering and entity retrieval. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic representation method for knowledge graph textbf{(KSR)}, which imposes a two-level hierarchical generative process that globally extracts many aspects and then locally assigns a specific category in each aspect for every triple. Since both aspects and categories are semantics-relevant, the collection of categories in each aspect is treated as the semantic representation of this triple. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines substantially.",

In this research, we propose a framework to organize information from multiple UGC sources by a topic hierarchy which is automatically generated and updated using the UGCs. We explore the unique characteristics of UGCs like blogs, cQAs, microblogs, etc., and introduce a novel scheme to combine them. We also propose a graph-based method to enable incremental update of the generated topic hierarchy. Using the hierarchy, users can easily obtain a comprehensive, in-depth and up-to-date picture of their topics of interests. The experiment results demonstrate how information from multiple heterogeneous sources improves the resultant topic hierarchies. It also shows that the proposed method achieves better F1 scores in hierarchy generation as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

This research aims at the customized organization of a social media corpus using focused topic hierarchy. It organizes the contents into different structures to meet with users' different information needs (e.g., \\\"iPhone 5 problem\\\" or \\\"iPhone 5 camera\\\"). To this end, we introduce a novel function to measure the likelihood of a topic hierarchy, by which the users' information need can be incorporated into the process of topic hierarchy construction. Using the structure information within the generated topic hierarchy, we then develop a probability based model to identify the representative contents for topics to assist users in document retrieval on the hierarchy. Experimental results on real world data illustrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods for both information organization and retrieval tasks.",

        "abstract": "Inactivating mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene occur in approximately 30 -50% of endometrial carcinomas. PTEN is a phospha- tase that negatively regulates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway, including the downstream effector AKT. To evaluate the role of PTEN in endometrial growth regulation, we expressed wild-type or mu- tant PTEN in endometrial carcinoma cell lines. As expected, expression of exogenous PTEN decreased levels of activated AKT in all cell lines exam- ined. However, PTEN induced a G1 cell cycle arrest specifically in endo- metrial carcinoma cells that lack endogenous wild-type PTEN. Growth of cells containing wild-type PTEN was unaffected by exogenous PTEN expression. Growth arrest required a functional phosphatase domain but not the PDZ interaction motif of PTEN. Overall levels of CIP/KIP and INK4 family members, the known inhibitory regulators of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, were unchanged. However, PTEN induced a specific reduc- tion of cyclin D3 levels and an associated increase in the amount of the inhibitor p27KIP1 complexed with CDK2. Enforced expression of cyclin D3 abrogated the PTEN-induced cell cycle arrest. Although PTEN signaling directly regulates p27KIP1 levels in some settings, in endometrial carci- noma cells, PTEN expression indirectly regulated p27KIP1 activity by modulating levels of cyclin D3. These data support multiple mechanisms of PTEN-induced cell cycle arrest.",

We induced various combinations of deletions in these tumor suppressors in astrocytes and neural precursors in mature mice, resulting in astrocytomas ranging from grade III to grade IV (glioblastoma). There was selection for mutation of multiple genes within a pathway, shown by somatic amplifications of genes in the PI3K or Rb pathway in tumors in which Pten or Rb deletion was an initiating event. Despite multiple mutations within PI3K and Rb pathways, elevated Mapk activation was not consistent. Gene expression profiling revealed striking similarities to subclasses of human diffuse astrocytoma. Astrocytomas were found within and outside of proliferative niches in the adult brain.",

PTEN mutation occurs in 25 to 40% of glioblastomas but is rarely observed in low-grade glial neoplasms. To determine the role of Pten in astrocytes and glial tumor formation, we inactivated Pten by a Cre-loxP approach with a GFAP-cre transgenic mouse that induced Cre-mediated recombination in astrocytes. Pten conditional knockout mice showed a striking progressive enlargement of the entire brain. Increased nuclear and soma size was observed in both astrocytes and neurons, which contributed in part to the increase in brain size. Pten-deficient astrocytes showed accelerated proliferation in vitro and aberrant ongoing proliferation in adult brains in vivo. In contrast, neurons lacking Pten did not show alterations in proliferation. This study shows cell-type dependent effects of Pten loss in the adult brain, including increased astrocyte proliferation that may render astroglial cells susceptible to neoplastic transformation or malignant progression.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms that regulate mammalian cell size during development and homeostatic maintenance are poorly understood. The tumor suppressor Pten is required for correct maintenance of mammalian neuronal soma size. Selective inactivation of Pten in postnatal granule neurons of the cerebellum and dentate gyrus in mouse causes cell-autonomous hypertrophy as well as more complex phenotypes, including progressive macrocephaly, seizures, and premature death. To determine the contribution of mTor signaling to Pten-mediated growth regulation in the mammalian nervous system, we treated Pten conditional knockout mice with CCI-779, a specific mTor inhibitor. mTor inhibition decreased the seizure frequency and death rate in Pten mutant mice, prevented the increase in Pten-deficient neuronal soma size in young mice, and reversed neuronal soma enlargement in adult mice. mTor inhibition did not decrease the size of wild-type adult neurons. Thus, mTor is required for neuronal hypertrophy downstream of Pten deficiency, but is not required for maintenance of normal neuronal soma size. mTOR inhibitors may be useful therapeutic agents for diseases in brain resulting from PTEN deficiency such as Lhermitte-Duclos disease or glioblastoma multiforme.",

        "abstract": "Diffuse high-grade gliomas (HGGs) of childhood are a spectrum of disease with devastatingly poor outcome. Despite similar histological features, pediatric HGGs arise from a broader distribution of anatomical locations when compared to adults, with approximately 50% arising in the brainstem as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a disease found almost exclusively in children. Recent genome-wide studies provided abundant evidence that unique selective pressures drive HGG in children compared to adults, identifying novel oncogenic mutations connecting tumorigenesis and chromatin regulation as well as developmental signaling pathways. The striking association between frequencies of specific mutations with spatiotemporal pattern of HGG formation in children further highlights context-dependent connections between developmental states and oncogenic drivers. Activating mutations in the BMP receptor ACVR1 are found exclusively in the youngest subgroup of DIPG patients, and not identified in HGGs outside the brainstem. Recurrent mutations in histone H3 establish a critical role for epigenetic regulation in disease pathogenesis of childhood HGG. H3K27M mutations occur in nearly 80% of DIPGs and more than half of HGGs arising in midline structures outside the brainstem such as the thalamus. In contrast, approximately 15% of HGGs arising in the cerebral cortex have an alternative H3 mutation, G34R/V, and are predominantly found in older adolescents and young adults. To study these mutations in the developing mammalian brain, we generated conditionally activated, epitope tagged H3f3a knock-in mice to express K27M, G34R or non-mutated H3.3 proteins from the endogenous H3f3a locus. We will present early analyses of these new oncohistone mouse models.   Citation Format:  Jon D. Larson, Andre B. Silveira, Lawryn H. Kasper, Alexander K. Diaz, Xiaoyan Zhu, Suzanne J. Baker.

        "abstract": "Pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs) are devastating diseases with poor prognosis. The two-year survival for pediatric HGG ranges from 30%, for tumors arising in the cerebral cortex, to less than 10% for diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), which arise in the brainstem. Recurrent somatic mutations in histone H3 found in pediatric HGGs are rare in adult HGGs and may represent genetic drivers of disease. Mutually exclusive somatic heterozygous  H3F3A  or  HIST1H3B  mutations encoding a K27M variant of histone H3.3 or H3.1, respectively, are found in nearly 80 percent of DIPGs and 22 percent of non-brainstem HGG, where they occur predominantly in thalamic and other midline tumors. Strikingly, heterozygous  H3F3A  mutations encoding histone H3.3 G34R or G34V occur in approximately 14 percent of non-brainstem HGG, and are associated predominantly with cortical tumors arising in older children through young adulthood, suggesting a distinct developmental origin compared to the majority of tumors harboring K27M mutations. DNA methylation signatures and gene expression patterns distinguish G34R/V and K27M tumors, but the oncogenic mechanisms and brain region selectivity of these mutations are still uncertain. To study these mutations in the developing mammalian brain, we generated conditionally activated, epitope tagged  H3f3a  knock-in mice to express K27M, G34R or non-mutated H3.3 proteins. When activated in neural and glial precursor cells, extensive  H3f3a  expression was observed throughout the embryonic brain, and H3.3-K27M induced loss of H3K27me3, consistent with observations in K27M mutant DIPG tumor samples. Moreover, neural stem cells expressing H3.3-K27M demonstrated an in vitro growth advantage compared to H3.3-G34R or H3.3-WT expressing neural stem cells. We will present an analysis of the epigenetic landscape and gene expression signatures associated with the histone H3 K27M and G34R mutations in different brain regions as well as phenotypic analysis of the mutant mice.

        "abstract": "Loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN exerts diverse outcomes on cancer in different developmental contexts. To gain insight into the effect of its loss on outcomes in the brain, we conditionally inactivated the murine Pten gene in neonatal neural stem/progenitor cells. Pten inactivation created an abnormal perivascular proliferative niche in the cerebellum that persisted in adult animals but did not progress to malignancy. Proliferating cells showed undifferentiated morphology and expressed the progenitor marker Nestin but not Math1, a marker of committed granule neuron progenitors. Codeletion of Pten and Trp53 resulted in fully penetrant medulloblastoma originating from the perivascular niche, which exhibited abnormal blood vessel networks and advanced neuronal differentiation of tumor cells. EdU pulse-chase experiments demonstrated a perivascular cancer stem cell population in Pten/Trp53 double mutant medulloblastomas. Genetic analyses revealed recurrent somatic inactivations of the tumor suppressor gene Ptch1 and a recapitulation of the sonic hedgehog subgroup of human medulloblastomas. Overall, our results showed that PTEN acts to prevent the proliferation of a progenitor niche in postnatal cerebellum predisposed to oncogenic induction of medulloblastoma.

We generated genetically engineered inducible mice and showed that H3.3 K27M enhanced neural stem cell self-renewal while preserving regional identity. Neonatal induction of H3.3 K27M cooperated with activating platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1 (PDGFR\u03b1) mutant and Trp53 loss to accelerate development of diffuse brainstem gliomas that recapitulated human DIPG gene expression signatures and showed global changes in H3K27 posttranslational modifications, but relatively restricted gene expression changes. Genes upregulated in H3.3 K27M tumors were enriched for those associated with neural development where H3K27me3 loss released the poised state of apparently bivalent promoters, whereas downregulated genes were enriched for those encoding homeodomain transcription factors.",

        "abstract": "Histone H3 K27M mutation is the defining molecular feature of the devastating pediatric brain tumor, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). The prevalence of histone H3 K27M mutations indicates a critical role in DIPGs, but the contribution of the mutation to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. We show that knockdown of this mutation in DIPG xenografts restores K27M-dependent loss of H3K27me3 and delays tumor growth. Comparisons of matched DIPG xenografts with and without K27M knockdown allowed identification of mutation-specific effects on the transcriptome and epigenome. The resulting transcriptional changes recapitulate expression signatures from K27M primary DIPG tumors and are strongly enriched for genes associated with nervous system development. Integrated analysis of ChIP-seq and expression data showed that genes upregulated by the mutation are overrepresented in apparently bivalent promoters. Many of these targets are associated with more immature differentiation states. Expression profiles indicate K27M knockdown decreases proliferation and increases differentiation within lineages represented in DIPG. These data suggest that K27M-mediated loss of H3K27me3 directly regulates a subset of genes by releasing poised promoters, and contributes to tumor phenotype and growth by limiting differentiation. The delayed tumor growth associated with knockdown of H3 K27M provides evidence that this highly recurrent mutation is a relevant therapeutic target.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Silk fibroin is extracted from the natural polymer fibrin, which has a good physical and chemical properties and biocompatibility. While there is no report addressing activation of T lymphocytes after implantation of regenerated porous silk fibroin film at home and abroad. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the activation of T lymphocytes in peripheral blood monouclear cells (PBMC), spleen and thymus on local trauma after implantation of regenerated porus silk fibrion film. METHODS: Wound with an area of 2 cm\u00d72 cm was established by removing SD rats' skin of back, and randomly divided into two groups: experimental group and control group. Pretreated regenerated porous silk fibroin film was covered in experimental group, and the epidermis of the excisional skin covered silk fibroin film to undergo suture. At 3, 14, 28, 56, 90 days after operation, would healing and residue of silk fibroin film were observed. Two-color immunofluorescence and flow cytometry technology were used to analyze CD3+CD25+/ CD3+T cell percentage of PBMC, spleen and thymus in rats. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: At the early stage of implantation, local and slight inflammatory cell infiltration could be seen between experimental and control groups, mainly lymphocytes. After 28 days, inflammatory cells were gradually decreased; the results between two groups were the same in the whole dynamic observation. Activated T cell of PBMC was transiently increased before 14 days, and then decreased. After 28 days, the level of activated T cell was tending towards stability. There was no significant difference between experimental and control groups (P > 0.05). T cells in spleen and thymus had small amounts of activation, and then began to decline and tended toward stability. Positive rate of CD3+CD25+/ CD3+T cell in thymus was slightly higher than that in spleen, and there was no significant difference between experimental and control groups (P > 0.05). It is indicated that regenerated porus silk fibrion film plays a small part in activation of T lymphocyte, and causes a weaker ability of cellular immune response.",

        "abstract": "Sorafenib, an antiangiogenic agent, can promote tumor invasion and metastasis. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/Snail-dependent pathway plays an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Yet, little is known concerning the role of the PI3K/Akt/Snail-dependent pathway in sorafenib\u2011induced invasion and metastasis of hepatic carcinoma (HCC). A human HCC orthotopic xenograft model was established, and sorafenib (30 mg/kg/day) was administered orally. Tumor growth and intrahepatic metastasis were assessed, and immunohistochemistry was applied to analyze the activation of the PI3K/Akt/Snail-dependent pathway. HCC cell lines were treated with sorafenib (1, 5 and 10 \u00b5M), and proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed. Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to examine the related gene expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and the PI3K/Akt/Snail-dependent pathway. Sorafenib inhibited tumor growth and promoted intrahepatic invasion and metastasis of the orthotopic tumors grown from SMMC7721-GFP cells in vivo. Additionally, sorafenib promoted EMT and invasion and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro. Importantly, sorafenib enhanced PI3K and Akt activation and upregulation of the expression of transcription factor Snail, a critical EMT mediator. The upregulation of transcription factor Snail expression by sorafenib may be related to activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The PI3K/Akt/Snail-dependent pathway may mediate the pro-invasive and pro-metastatic effects of sorafenib on HCC by inducing EMT.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be diagnosed by noninvasive approaches with serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) levels >200 ng/ml and/or a radiological imaging study of tumor mass >2 cm in patients with chronic liver disease. Percutaneous fine needle aspiration (FNA) under ultrasound (US) guidance has a diagnostic specificity of 95% and is superior to radiological imaging studies.The aim of this study is to elucidate the effectiveness and complications of fine needle aspiration in a Chinese population with primary liver cancer and AFP levels \u2264200 ng/ml.A retrospective study was conducted over a period of 28 years. This selection period included patients with a suspected diagnosis of primary liver cancer whose AFP levels were \u2264200 ng/ml and who underwent US-FNA. This data was then analyzed with cytomorphological features correlating with medical history, radiological imaging, AFP, and follow-up information.Of the 1,929 cases with AFP \u2264200 mg/ml, 1,756 underwent FNA. Of these, 1,590 cases were determined malignant and the remaining 166 were determined benign. Further, 1,478 malignant cases were diagnosed by FNA alone, and of these, 1,138 were diagnosed as PLC. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of the diagnoses were 92.96%, 100%, 100%, 59.71%, and 93.62% respectively. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV between the subgroups with tumor size<2 cm and \u22652 cm. Major complications included implantation metastasis and hemorrhage.Patients with PLC, especially those who present with an AFP \u2264200 ng/ml, should undergo FNA. If negative results are obtained by FNA, it still could be HCC and repeated FNA procedure may be needed if highly suspicious of HCC on imaging study. The superiority of FNA in overall accuracy may outweigh its potential complications, such like hemorrhage and implantation metastasis.",

Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the effect of HBV infection on PDAC progression among a large cohort in China.   Methods: A multicenter cohort study was conducted to explore whether liver metastasis and overall survival in locally advanced and metastatic PDAC could be affected by HBV infection. In this study, we collected 1,526 advanced PDAC patients at three participating hospitals - Shanghai Cancer Center, Changhai Hospital and Ruijin Hospital from 2004 to 2013. The association between HBV status and advanced PDAC progression was then examined.   Results: In multivariable Logistic regression model, chronic hepatitis B(CHB) infection was inversely associated with synchronous liver metastasis compared to non HBV infection (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.85) for stage IV patients. In a multivariable Cox model, CHB infection (HR=0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.82) is considered as a protective factor of metachronous liver metastasis compared to Non HBV infection for stage III patients. For stage IV patients, CHB infection was inversely associated with overall survival compared to non HBV infection (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.95). Inactive carrier(IC) and resolved HBV infection showed no significant association with survival compared to non HBV infection.   Conclusion: This study indicated that CHB infection may serve as an independent factor which decrease synchronous or metachronous liver metastasis, and increase overall survival among advanced PDAC patients.",

        "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting adversely affects the quality of life of patients who receive chemotherapy via intravenous infusion or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). This study aimed to investigate the clinical effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on nausea and vomiting after TACE. A total of 142 patients who received TACE with cisplatin for primary or metastatic liver cancer were assigned to the active-acupuncture (n\u00a0=\u00a072) or placebo-acupuncture (n\u00a0=\u00a070) groups using a covariate-adaptive randomization at a ratio of 1:1. The acupoints Hegu (LI4), Neiguan (P6), and Zusanli (ST36) were stimulated twice daily for 6\u00a0days. The effects of TEAS on nausea and vomiting were assessed by using occurrence rate and severity of these symptoms. Anorexia scale and M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) scores were secondary endpoints and were used to assess the effect of TEAS on patient appetite and quality of life. The safety of the treatments was also monitored. Between the two groups, the differences in occurrence rates and severities of nausea and vomiting after TACE were not significant (all P\u00a0u003e\u00a00.05). From the second day after TACE, anorexia scores were significantly lower in the active-acupuncture group than in the placebo-acupuncture group and continued to decrease over time with treatment (all P values less than 0.01). On days 0, 1, and 2, the mean MDASI scores for the active-acupuncture group were slightly lower than those for the placebo-acupuncture group, but the differences were not statistically significant (all P\u00a0u003e\u00a00.05). No significant differences were found between the two groups in the occurrence rate of any adverse event (P\u00a0u003e\u00a00.05). TEAS appears to be a safe and effective therapy to relieve patients\u2019 gastrointestinal discomfort after chemotherapy.                            Trial registration NCT01895010.

        "abstract": "Sorafenib mainly exerts its anti-hepatoma effect by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. However, its curative effect is limited. Thus, application of drugs which could augment its anti-angiogenic effect is necessary. Bufalin has been reported to possess anticancer properties. In the present study, we investigated the synergistic anti-angiogenic effect of sorafenib combined with bufalin. The enhanced anti-angiogenic effect of the combination treatment was firstly assessed in nude mice bearing human HCC intradermal tumors. In addition, we found that proliferation was significantly inhibited and the morphology was obviously changed in the combination-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) at 48 h of treatment. In addition, the combination treatment was found to suppress vessel formation potently as proved in the tube formation, chick chorioallantoic membrane and rat aortic rings. Mechanistically, HUVEC incubated with the combination treatment showed increased apoptosis, decreased migration, which might account for its capacity against angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial cells have been reported to secrete cytokines to affect angiogenesis. Therefore, suspensions from HUVECs with different treatments were collected as conditioned medium (CM). The combination-treated CM significantly inhibited the migration of HUVEC and blood vessel formation in vitro. Importantly, multiple cytokines associated with angiogenesis were downregulated in the combination-treated CM. Furthermore, we verified that the secretion of VEGF was downregulated and revealed that the reduction might be regulated through the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Taken together, our findings demonstrated for the first time that bufalin can enhance anti-angiogenic effect of sorafenib via modulating the AKT/VEGF signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "It has been reported that there are multiple mechanisms by which bufalin could exert its antimetastatic effect. HIF-1\u03b1 has been reported to be involved in tumor migration and invasion by regulating EMT. However, it is not known whether bufalin could exert the antimetastatic effect by modulating HIF-1\u03b1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antimetastatic potential of bufalin in vivo and in vitro. Our results demonstrated that the liver/lung metastases were significantly reduced in bufalin-treated mice, as tested in the orthotopic transplanted and tail vein injection tumor models. Furthermore, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was inhibited in bufalin-treated tumors, as reflected the upregulation of E-cadherin, and downregulation of N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail. Similar results were observed in SMMC7721 cells treated with bufalin. Moreover, the transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21)-induced EMT was also abrogated by bufalin. Mechanistically, our study demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) played an important role in the antimetastatic effect of bufalin in hepatocellular carcinoma. Importantly, HIF-1\u03b1 expression may be regulated through the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that bufalin suppresses hepatic tumor invasion and metastasis and that this process may be related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/ HIF-1\u03b1 axis. ",

        "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are important in cancer, as these cells possess enhanced tumor-forming capabilities and are resistant to current anticancer therapies. Agents with the ability to suppress CSCs are likely to provide novel opportunities for combating tumor proliferation and metastasis. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of bufalin on pancreatic CSCs in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. Using a serum\u2011free suspension culture, tumor spheres were enriched in a gemcitabine\u2011resistant human pancreatic cancer cell line, which had a higher percentage of CSCs, and western blotting, flow cytometry, and colony and tumor formation assays were used to demonstrate that these sphere cells exhibited CSC characteristics. Using these cancer stem\u2011like cells as a model, the present study examined the effect of bufalin on pancreatic CSCs. It was demonstrated that bufalin inhibited the number of tumor spheres, and western blotting and immunohistochemical assays showed that the expression levels of CD24 and epithelial specific antigen (ESA) were downregulated by bufalin. Furthermore, in a subcutaneous xenograft model of implanted gemcitabine\u2011resistant MiaPaCa2 cells, bufalin inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the duration of tumor formation. Additionally, the expression levels of CD24 and ESA were inhibited in the bufalin\u2011treated mice. Notably, in another cancer model injected with tumor cells via the tail vein, fewer metastatic lesions were detected in the group in which tumor cells were pretreated with bufalin in\u00a0vitro, compared with those without pretreatment. Of note, the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway was found to be inhibited in the bufalin\u2011treated cells. Taken together, these results suggested that bufalin suppressed pancreatic CSCs in gemcitabine-resistant MiaPaCa2 cells, and the Hh signaling pathway may be involved in this process. ",

The current study examined whether silencing Slc38a1, a gene involved in energy metabolism, using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) could inhibit the growth, migration, and invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells.A series of Slc38a1 shRNAs were designed and cloned into the pGPU6/GFP/Neo vectors. An shRNA with the most efficacious inhibitory action on SCL38A1 expression (65% inhibition) upon screening in DH5\u03b1 bacteria was used to transfect SW1990 human pancreatic cancer cells. Cell growth, migration, and invasiveness were examined using cell counting kit-8, Boyden chamber without and with Matrigel, respectively.Transfection of SW1990 cells with the SLCs38A1 shRNA significantly decreased the proliferation (P<0.0001) and migratory potential (by 46.7%, P=0.0399) of the cancer cells. Invasiveness, however, was not affected.Inhibiting Slc38a1 using shRNA technology could decrease the growth and migration of representative pancreatic cancer cells. However, the fact that invasiveness was not affected suggested that SLC38A1 is unlikely to be responsible for early metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Location-based services (LBSs) have been one of the novel uses and most popular activities in internet of things (IoT). In such location-based applications, mobile users enjoy plenty of conveniences at the cost of privacy. To protect user's location privacy, many research solutions have been proposed. In this paper, we focus on an important class of solutions, short-range communication-based spatial cloaking algorithms, which achieve k -anonymity within some collaborative groups. We first analyze the inherent drawbacks of existing P2P-based and encounter-based spatial cloaking approaches and propose a Variance-Based Attack (VBA) against them. Then we study the proposed attack on several existing spatial cloaking solutions. Finally, we propose a countermeasure R -cloak, which can mitigate VBA for current P2P cloaking algorithms. Our empirical evaluations further verify the effectiveness and efficiency of R -cloak. We design a variance-based attack to exploit weaknesses of some existing algorithms.We verify the effectiveness of our VBA on several existing algorithms.We propose a random walk-based cloaking algorithm to mitigate the proposed attack.",

As an important component of LBSNs, recommender systems gained popularity in recent years. Recommender systems can automatically list candidate locations for users according to their preferences, which is different from traditional search methods. However, making effective recommendations suffers from data sparsity. In order to relieve this problem and achieve high effectiveness, we take context information into consideration and present a personalized location recommender system considering both user preference and local features in this paper. To be specific, we apply Labeled-LDA in user preference learning and local features inference processes, which are denoted as UL-LDA model and CL-LDA model, respectively. Because of this, we can make recommendations even on the condition that users are in a new city and have little information about the city. We evaluate our approach with extensive experiments on a large-scale Foursquare dataset. The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Proximity-based mobile social networks (PMSNs) are a novel type of social networks, where mobile users can choose potential friends in vicinity by comparing the similarity degree between their private attributes and make new connections through the WiFi/Bluetooth interfaces on their mobile devices. Since users' personal attributes usually contain some sensitive information, users may have increasing privacy concerns and do not want to reveal their attributes to others in the process of friend discovery. In this paper, we first propose a two-party private matching algorithm, which achieves a fine-grained match and protects users' privacy preferably without reliance on any Trusted Third Party (TTP). Based on the two-party protocol, we then present a multi-party matching protocol, where a responder who satisfies the pre-defined threshold can match with a group of users without breaching their privacy. By the detailed analysis and simulations, we evaluate our two matching schemes in terms of security, communication overhead and computation overhead, which show a better performance than other related protocols.",

        "abstract": "With usersu0027 explosively increasing needs for online data, current IP-based or host-based Internet architecture is becoming insufficient and outdated gradually. Named Data Networking (NDN) is considered as a candidate of next-generation Internet architectures. In NDN, an addressable content name, rather than an IP address, is used to publish, request, deliver and manage the content. In addition, NDN employs router caches to replicate and store passing packets, so that previously requested contents can be delivered very quickly. Although router caching can improve network throughput significantly, it also introduces a few serious privacy problems. In this paper, we focus on studying snooping attack, in which a snooper can learn about other usersu0027 preferences and breach their privacy by measuring the time difference between responses. To address this problem, we utilize the signatures of abnormal events to detect abnormal user behaviors, and build a credit score for each user according to his behaviors. When the credit score of a user drops below a predefined threshold, this user is considered as a snooper. Then, we deliberately add a response delay to the snooper so that he can be isolated from normal users. The performance analysis shows that our scheme can efficiently protect router caching privacy against snooping attack, with keeping high network performance.",

        "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) is expected to provide a fully informative and controllable environment that features networking, automation, and intelligence by interconnecting physical systems to cyber world. Such a correlation opens the interdependence between the two, upon which a single incident in one domain, e.g., a broken communication link, or an out-of-battery device, can cause a cascade-of-failures across physical and cyber domains. To understand the resilience of IoT systems against such detrimental cascades, this paper studies the aftermath of edge and jointly-induced cascades, that is, a sequence of failures induced by randomly broken physical links (and simultaneous failing cyber nodes) by answering how many nodes will survive the cascade with a newly defined node yield metric. Specifically, we construct a framework to establish self-consistent equations of node yield through an auxiliary graph, without requiring the exact network topology. Then two algorithms are proposed to numerically calculate node yield for interdependent networks with arbitrary degree distributions. For random graph with Poisson degree distributions, we prove the existence of a critical initial edge disconnecting probability \u03c6_cr, under which an edge-induced cascade will result in dissolving the network topology, derive the closed form solution for \u03c6_cr, and find that \u03c6_cr increases sub-linearly with the mean degree of the physical network.",

However, the first assumption is not suitable for EPC Class-1 Gen-2 tags, which has been challenged in many research work, while the second one cannot be adopted in mobile RFID applications where the wireless channels between readers and the server are always insecure. In this paper, we propose a new ultralightweight authentication protocol for mobile RFID systems. We only use bitwise XOR, and special constructed pseudo-random number generators (RNGs) to achieve our aims in insecure mobile RFID environment. Security analysis shows that our protocol can provide several privacy properties and avoid suffering from kinds of attacks, including tag anonymity, tag location privacy, reader privacy, forward secrecy, and mutual authentication, replay attack, desynchronization attack etc. We implement our protocol and compare authentication delays with several existing work, the results indicate us that our protocol significantly improves the efficiency. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

To avoid the communication overhead caused by broadcasting the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and the privacy disclosure issue of the revocation vehicles, we revoke the illegal vehicles through calculating Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) by using the group key. In addition, integrity of the batch messages is ensured and efficient batch authentication is achieved. The analysis shows that our scheme has a better performance than the current batch authentication schemes on authentication delay and revocation overhead. The generated group key and pair key during the authenticated process can be used for value-added service, as the realization of HMAC doesn't require additional overhead.",

        "abstract": "Radio frequency identification technology has been increasingly used in many applications. However, there are many threats and security risks in the RFID systems since an insecure wireless channel exists between the reader and the tags. The security of RFID protocols must be designed and proved with careful cryptanalysis. In this paper, we analyze some RFID authentication protocols proposed recently. Firstly, Shen et al. propose an authentication protocol with strong privacy and security, but we prove that the attacker is able to impersonate a reader to desynchronize a tag by eavesdropping on and modifying the messages transmitted. Secondly, WeiHWang et al. claim that their hash function based protocol can resist from several attacks including denial of service attack, but we perform this attack by inducing a desynchronization of secret between server and tags. At last, Sandhya and Rangaswarmy propose an authentication protocol with many security features, while we present desynchronization attack and reader impersonation attack on this protocol.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancement of Mobile Social Networks (MSNs), in which mobile users can make friends and conduct other social activities. Common Friends is a popular application that allows a mobile user to participate in a matching process for mutual friends discovery, utilizing the information of participatesu0027 friends. However, privacy of participants and their friends may be breached if the matching protocol is not carefully designed. Although several protocols based on Private Set intersection (PSI) have been proposed to protect usersu0027 privacy, the complicated underlying cryptographic tools or interactive processes make them infeasible to be implemented in resource-restricted mobile devices. In this paper, based on blind signature and bloom filter, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving friendship establishment protocol, which can ensure usersu0027 privacy and reduce the complexity of set intersection computation. We introduce a bloom filter on the responderu0027s side to improve efficiency of mobile usersu0027 friends information comparison and employ blind signature to prevent the initiatoru0027s input from being inferred by malicious responders with large amount of enumeration. The security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that our protocol works well for usersu0027 privacy protection and is feasible to be implemented.",

However, large communication sources, storage space, and checking time are needed for CRLs that cause the privacy disclosure issue as well. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an efficient anonymous batch authentication scheme (ABAH) to replace the CRL checking process by calculating the hash message authentication code (HMAC). In our scheme, we first divide the precinct into several domains, in which road-side units (RSUs) manage vehicles in a localized manner. Then, we adopt pseudonyms to achieve privacy-preserving and realize batch authentication by using an identity-based signature (IBS). Finally, we use HMAC to avoid the time-consuming CRL checking and to ensure the integrity of messages that may get loss in previous batch authentication. The security and performance analysis are carried out to demonstrate that ABAH is more efficient in terms of verification delay than the conventional authentication methods employing CRLs.

Then, they decide whether to make new social interactions through WiFi/Bluetooth interfaces embedded in their mobile devices according to the matching information. However, since group attributes usually contain some sensitive information, users may have increasing privacy concerns and do not want to reveal them to strangers. In this paper, we propose G2G, a novel privacy-preserving group matching mechanism, which can support group matching with preserving the privacy of all group members by applying permutation function. Considering a few potential attacks, we design an enhanced version G2G+, which can further improve group privacy.

However, the matching process calls for the publication of users' personal information, which conflicts with users' growing privacy concerns about revealing their profiles to strangers. To achieve privacy-preserving friend discovery, many schemes are proposed based on traditional cryptographic methods, such as homomorphic and commutative encryption, which inevitably introduce tremendous overhead to the system and are not practical for the resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Weight-based Private Matching (EWPM) protocol, which provides a realistic matching approach considering both the number of common interests and the corresponding weights on them. In EWPM, we utilize the Confusion Matrix Transformation (CMT) algorithm to achieve a secure and efficient matching.

We characterize the throughput-delay-storage tradeoffs under different node mobility patterns, i.e., i.i.d. and random walk mobility, with and without network coding. Our results show that when random linear coding instead of replication is used in MANETs, an order improvement on the scaling laws of MANETs can be achieved. Note that previous work showed that network coding could only provide constant improvement on the throughput of static wireless networks. Our work thus differentiates MANETs from static wireless networks by the role network coding plays.",

        "abstract": "Network coding is widely recognized as a promising approach to increase the throughput of wireless networks. In order to maximize the benefit of network coding, the consideration of potential coding opportunities is incorporated into the route selection, which is referred to as coding-aware routing. Most of existing coding-aware routing metrics are designed based on traditional routing metrics like expected transmission count (ETX) and fail to take many critical factors into account, such as traffic load, link transmission rate and interference. Therefore, the routes discovered with them are always sub-optimal. In this paper, we present a novel routing metric called Coding-aware Path Transmission Time (CPTT). CPTT considers the effect of traffic load, multirate, intra-flow and inter-flow interference as well as network coding and quantifies them in a unified manner, which can be used to accurately evaluate path performance and discover the path with high throughput. Through extensive simulations, we compare CPTT with different coding-aware routing metrics proposed in the literature and show that the paths selected with CPTT have maximum end-to-end throughput under network coding.",

        "abstract": "For a multi-hop wireless network (MWN) consisting of mobile nodes controlled by independent self-interested users, incentive mechanism is essential for motivating mobile nodes to cooperate and forward packets for each other. Existing solutions such as barter based, virtual-currency based and reputation based schemes are either less effective or incur high implementation costs, and therefore do not fit well with the unique requirements of MWNs. In this paper, we propose a novel and promising incentive paradigm, Controlled Coded packets as virtual Commodity Currency (C4), to induce cooperative behaviors in MWNs. In our C4, through introducing several techniques from network coding, coded information packets are utilized as a new kind of virtual currency to facilitate packet/service exchanges among self-interested nodes in a MWN. Since the virtual currency implemented in this way also carries useful data information, it is the counterpart of the so-called commodity currency in the physical world, and the overhead brought by C4 is extremely small compared to traditional schemes. We theoretically show that C4 is perfectly efficient to support MWNs with broadcast and multicast traffics. For pure unicast communications, by adjusting the grouping parameter, our C4 provides a systematic way to smoothly trade incentive effectiveness for implementation cost, and traditional barter based and virtual-currency based schemes are just two extreme cases of C4. We also show that when our C4 is combined with the social network formed by mobile users in the MWN, the implementation costs can be further reduced without sacrificing incentive effectiveness. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

Although various trust metrics have been designed and incorporated into the routing metrics, as far as we know, none of the existing works have used mathematical tools such as routing algebra to analyze the compatibility of trust related routing metrics and routing protocols in WANETs. In this paper, we first identify unique features of trust metrics compared with QoS-based routing metrics. Then, we provide a systematic analysis of the relationship between trust metrics and trust-based routing protocols by identifying the basic algebraic properties that a trust metric must have in order to work correctly and optimally with different generalized distance-vector or link-state routing protocols in WANETs. Moreover, we extend our framework to model the interactions between different trust-based routing protocols. Finally, our results are applied to check the compatibility of the trust metrics proposed in previous literature and the popular routing protocols used in WANETs.",

        "abstract": "Location-based social networks (LBSNs) enable users not only to record where and when they go using check-ins but also to publish their ratings and comments of these locations. All information can be utilized to infer usersu0027 interests and to generate personalized location recommendations for different individuals. In this process, temporal context plays a significant role, because life patterns of users vary greatly and different locations have different proper visiting time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a top-k location recommendation scheme, considering the influence of temporal context. To be specific, we first model user-location-time relations with a three dimensional tensor. Then, we extract a user-user similarity matrix and a location feature matrix to relieve data sparsity problem and to increase the prediction accuracy of estimated ratings during the tensor decomposition process. Through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach, we can obtain any useru0027s rating for any location in any time slot. Moreover, we partition a large area into several small ones and adopt the Threshold Algorithm (TA) to improve efficiency of online recommendations. We evaluate our method in a real-world dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "Spectrum auction is an enabling technology for improving the spectrum efficiency of unused licensed bands (white spaces) in wireless networks. However, the back-room dealing (i.e., the frauds of the untrustworthy auctioneer and the bid-rigging between the greedy bidders and the insincere auctioneer) poses serious security challenges, leading to failures of all existing secure auction designs in allocating spectrum bands. In this paper, we propose a secure combinatorial spectrum auction (SCSA) by utilizing homomorphic encryption to prevent the back-room dealing. The idea in SCSA is to incorporate cryptographic techniques into the spectrum auction to address the frauds and bid-rigging. It computes and reveals the results of spectrum auction while the actual bidding values of bidders are kept confidential. SCSA also provides a corresponding procedure in implementing the combinatorial spectrum auction under the interference constraints. We show that compared with existing secure spectrum auction designs against the untrustworthy auctioneer, SCSA is much more efficient in both communication and computational complexity; and compared with other spectrum auction designs with security consideration, SCSA can effectively thwart the back-room dealings due to the untrustworthy auctioneer without too much performance degradation.",

        "abstract": "Conventional block-based multicast authentication schemes overlook the heterogeneity of receivers by letting the sender choose the block size, divide a multicast stream into blocks, associate each block with a signature, and spread the effect of the signature across all the packets in the block through hash graphs or coding algorithms. The correlation among packets makes them vulnerable to packet loss, which is inherent in the Internet and wireless networks. Moreover, the lack of Denial of Service (DoS) resilience renders most of them vulnerable to packet injection in hostile environments. In this paper, we propose a novel multicast authentication protocol, namely MABS, including two schemes. The basic scheme (MABS-B) eliminates the correlation among packets and thus provides the perfect resilience to packet loss, and it is also efficient in terms of latency, computation, and communication overhead due to an efficient cryptographic primitive called batch signature, which supports the authentication of any number of packets simultaneously. We also present an enhanced scheme MABS-E, which combines the basic scheme with a packet filtering mechanism to alleviate the DoS impact while preserving the perfect resilience to packet loss.",

Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter are among the most popular applications of OSNs where personal information is shared among group contacts. Due to the private nature of the shared information, data privacy is an indispensable security requirement in OSN applications. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme for data sharing in OSNs, with efficient revocation for deterring a contact's access right to the private data once the contact is removed from the social group. In addition, the proposed scheme offers advanced features such as efficient search over encrypted data files and dynamic changes to group membership. With slight modification, we extend the application of the proposed scheme to anonymous online social networks of different security and functional requirements.

Although the existing obfuscation and location anonymization techniques along with a long-term pseudonym can protect users' location privacy to some extent, users' real identities and moving trajectories can still be deduced through long-term observation and side information aided inference attacks. To address these problems, we propose a dynamic pseudo-ID system, where unlinkable pseudo-IDs are used by users to completely hide their identities in the queries, in order to break the link between users' identities and their locations. Moreover, we employ certificates to ensure the verifiability and traceability of the dynamic pseudo-IDs. Security analysis and evaluation results show that the proposed scheme can enhance user' privacy and is feasible to implement into mobile devices.",

The mobile users enjoy convenience by submitting their private information. Nonetheless, the users' sensitive information may be abused by an un-trusted LBS server. Privacy concerned in LBSs can be categorized into two major types: location privacy and query privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called Encounter-Based Privacy-Preserving Scheme (EPS), which allows a user to access an LBS server under the protection of k-anonymity on both her location privacy and query privacy. Without reliance on any Trusted Third Party (TTP), EPS uses a buffer on each user's mobile device to collect the queried information of the encountered users. To achieve k-anonymity, a user needs to choose k-1 records from her buffer, with the help of our location obfuscating algorithm and querying algorithm, the user's privacy can be protected. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed EPS.",

To eliminate the disclosure of authorized data usersu0027 privacy in cloud services (e.g., cloud storage or cloud-assisted computing)-since the cloud providers cannot be fully trustworthy-several previous works have proposed considerable privacy-preserving schemes by exploiting searchable encryption. However, owing to its feature of untrusty, issue arises on how data users can verify whether the cloud has faithfully executed the search operations or not. Motivated by this question, in this paper, we propose a searchable and verifiable query scheme over encrypted data based on Counting Bloom Filter (CBF). Specifically, we deploy counting bloom filters to generate proofs for data usersu0027 queries in the private cloud; using the consistence between algebra operations on counting bloom filters and on data sets, we can verify the integrity of search result.

Unfortunately, this will breach users' location privacy and security. To address this problem, we propose a novel collaborative system, MobiCache, which combines k-anonymity with caching together to protect user's location privacy while improving the cache hit ratio. Different from the traditional k-anonymity, our Dummy Selection Algorithm (DSA) chooses dummy locations which have not been queried before to increase the cache hit ratio. We also propose an enhanced-DSA to further improve the user's privacy as well as the cache hit ratio by assigning dummy locations which can make more contributions to cache hit ratio. Evaluation results show that the proposed DSA can increase the cache hit ratio and the enhanced-DSA can further improve the cache hit ratio as well as the user's privacy.",

As the cloud is semi-trusted or susceptible to attacks, many researches suggest that the outsourced data should be encrypted and then retrieved by using searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) schemes. Since the cloud is not fully trusted, we doubt whether it would always process queries correctly or not. Therefore, there is a need for users to verify their query results. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a publicly verifiable dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme based on the accumulation tree. We first construct an accumulation tree based on encrypted data and then outsource both of them to the cloud. Next, during the search operation, the cloud generates the corresponding proof according to the query result by mapping Boolean query operations to set operations while keeping privacy-preservation and achieving the verification requirements: authenticity, freshness, and completeness. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed scheme is privacy-preserving and practical.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of genomic technologies, especially the DNA sequencing progress, greatly decreases the costs in genome sequencing, which leads to a high availability of genomic data in the near future (e.g., medical test and healthcare). Meanwhile, the increasing popularity of smartphones and mobile connectivity makes it an inevitable trend to use genomic data on mobile devices. However, since oneu0027s genomic information is the ultimate identifier of an individual and contains sensitive private data (e.g., disease predispositions, ancestry information, etc.), the use of genomic data may raise serious privacy concerns. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways of using genomic data on mobile devices without disclosure and abuse of the individualu0027s privacy. In this paper, we provide a general framework for storing and processing genomic data privately, in which dynamic symmetric searchable encryption (DSSE) is employed for users to efficiently retrieve their needed genomic data from the Cloud Storage Provider (CSP). Then, users can implement the genetic disease susceptibility test with these genomic data on their mobile devices. Our proposed framework can achieve a higher privacy preserving level at a lower computation cost. Performance evaluation shows the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed scheme.",

Users query the LBSs server and get service information about their surroundings. Unfortunately, these queries may lead to serious security and privacy concerns. It is very hard for users to access LBSs while keeping their privacy at the same time. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel scheme, called 3PLUS. It can significantly improve users' location privacy without reliance on the Trusted Third Party (TTP). Further more, it is simple to implement, and does not require changing the current structure of LBSs server. Users use a buffer to record the pseudo-locations, which come from both the history locations of herself and the encountered users. When two users encounter, by using their pseudonyms, they randomly choose a pseudo-location from their buffers and exchange with each other. Then she can find and submit k valid locations together to un-trusted LBSs server easily when the service is needed. Our evaluation results indicate us a hidden relationship between k, the buffer size S and exchanging number N.",

Mobile users can enjoy kinds of conveniences by submitting their location and interest-related queries to the LBS server. However, since these queries may expose sensitive information to the untrusted LBS server, privacy concerns arise. To address the serious privacy issues, we propose a novel collaborative scheme, EPcloak, which combines a privacy-preserving spatial cloaking algorithm and caching to protect user's privacy. Different from existing schemes, users in EPcloak cache their past service data for future use. When LBSs are needed, a user first uses a Local Searching Algorithm (LSA) to look for service data from the nearby friends of a collaborative group through Ad Hoc networks. If the requirements cannot be satisfied, the user uses a Spatial Cloaking Algorithm (SCA) to forward the query to another user at a certain distance away through a set of forwarders. That user will query the LBS server to get service data for a larger area that can cover the original user's query area, and send the data back to the original user. SCA protects both user's location privacy and query privacy. Evaluation results indicate that our proposed LSA and SCA are effective and efficient.",

While enjoying the convenience provided by LBS, users may lose privacy since the untrusted LBS server has all the information about users in LBS and it may track them in various ways or release their personal data to third parties. To address the privacy issue, we propose a Dummy-Location Selection (DLS) algorithm to achieve k-anonymity for users in LBS. Different from existing approaches, the DLS algorithm carefully selects dummy locations considering that side information may be exploited by adversaries. We first choose these dummy locations based on the entropy metric, and then propose an enhanced-DLS algorithm, to make sure that the selected dummy locations are spread as far as possible. Evaluation results show that the proposed DLS algorithm can significantly improve the privacy level in terms of entropy. The enhanced-DLS algorithm can enlarge the cloaking region while keeping similar privacy level as the DLS algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Privacy concern is arguably the major barrier that hinders the deployment of electronic health record (EHR) systems which are considered more efficient, less error-prone, and of higher availability compared to traditional paper record systems. Patients are unwilling to accept the EHR system unless their protected health information (PHI) containing highly confidential data is guaranteed proper use and disclosure, which cannot be easily achieved without patients' control over their own PHI. However, cautions must be taken to handle emergencies in which the patient may be physically incompetent to retrieve the controlled PHI for emergency treatment. In this paper, we propose a secure EHR system, HCPP (Healthcaresystem for Patient Privacy), based on cryptographic constructions and existing wireless network infrastructures, to provide privacy protection to patients under any circumstances while enabling timelyPHI retrieval for life-saving treatment in emergency situations. Furthermore, our HCPP system restricts PHI access to authorized (not arbitrary) physicians, who can be traced and held accountable if the accessed PHI is found improperly disclosed. Last but not least, HCPP leverages wireless network access to support efficient and private storage/retrieval of PHI, which underlies a secure and feasible EHR system.",

        "abstract": "Location-based Services (LBSs) enable mobile users to request and obtain certain services based on their current locations, such as finding nearby gas station, looking for coffee shops, and using online GPS navigation, etc. As a major branch of LBSs, geosocial networking services, such as Foursquare, become popular due to the explosive growth of smartphone users. Geosocial networking services allow people to use their location information to find potential friends who have similar interests within close proximity and initiate communications with each other. However, most existing geosocial networking services ask for mobile users' current location information and store it on an untrusted server with less privacy concerns. To some extent, mobile users need to reveal their interests and physical location information to a service provider in order to realize the functionality of geosocial networking, which apparently deteriorates users' privacy on the aspects of their profiles and locations. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving friend search scheme in geosocial networks without relying on a trusted centralized server. Our scheme lets localization infrastructures, such as base stations, create encrypted searchable tables on an untrusted server and allow mobile users to search for their possible friends using their profiles without exposing their location information. Extensive trace-driven simulation results and analysis show both the efficiency and privacy preservation of our proposed scheme.",

Recently, trust based encryption (TBE) has been proposed to deal with secure information sharing and dissemination for such networks. Unfortunately, the previously proposed schemes are not efficient in terms of communications overhead. In this paper, we provide a trust based encryption schemes which can significantly improve the communication overhead. The proposed scheme is based on a recently proposed revocable identity based encryption technique which can reduce the communication overhead at the central trust authority from the linear order of the number of the users in the network to the linear order of the number of the revoked users.",

        "abstract": "Security and privacy issues in RFID technology gain tremendous popularity recently. However, existing work on RFID authentication problems always make assumptions such as (1) hash function can be fully employed in designing RFID protocols; (2) channels between readers and server are always secure. The first assumption is not suitable for EPC Class-1 Gen-2 tags, which has been challenged in many research work, while the second one cannot be directly adopted in mobile RFID applications where wireless channels between readers and server are always insecure. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel ultralightweight and privacy-preserving authentication protocol for mobile RFID systems. We only use bitwise XOR, and several special constructed pseudo-random number generators to achieve our aims in the insecure mobile RFID environment. We use GNY logic to prove the security correctness of our proposed protocol. The security and privacy analysis show that our protocol can provide several privacy properties and avoid suffering from a number of attacks, including tag anonymity, tag location privacy, reader privacy, forward secrecy, and mutual authentication, replay attack, desynchronization attack etc. We implement our protocol and compare several parameters with existing work, the evaluation results indicate us that our protocol significantly improves the system performance.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of location-aware devices such as smart phones, Location-Based Services (LBSs) are becoming increasingly popular. Users can enjoy convenience by sending queries to LBS servers and obtaining service information that is nearby. However, these queries may leak the users' locations and interests to the un-trusted LBS servers, leading to serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Pseudo-Location Updating System (3PLUS) to achieve k-anonymity for mobile users using LBSs. In 3PLUS, without relying on a third party, each user keeps pseudo-locations obtained from both the history locations and the encountered users, and randomly exchanges one of them with others when encounters occur. As a result, each user's buffer is disordered. A user can obtain any k locations from the buffer to achieve k-anonymity locally. The security analysis shows the security properties and our evaluation results indicate that the user's privacy is significantly improved. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The rapid expansion of urbanization and the fast pace of life result in abundant choices with little time for people to manage routes. A proper planning route enables us to enjoy life better with fewer time and energy costs. Therefore, route planning becomes too valuable to be ignored. At the same time, with the popularity of mobile devices, location sensing, and Web 2.0 technologies, location-based social networks (e.g., Facebook Palaces and Foursquare) have attracted millions of users to share their visited locations and other information, which generates large amounts of user check-in data. These data can be used to mine users\u2019 preferences and time information for recommending routes. In this paper, we propose FineRoute, a personalized and time-sensitive route recommendation system. We take three factors users\u2019 preferences, proper visiting time, and transition time into consideration for the route generation. First, we infer users\u2019 preferences by constructing a three-dimensional tensor, with three dimensions representing users, locations, and time, respectively. Second, we obtain the proper visiting time for certain locations, as well as the transition time between two locations from the check-in dataset. Moreover, we adopt Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence in order to measure the quality of a route in terms of the proper visiting month and the proper visiting hour. Finally, we propose a route generation algorithm by extending the classic longest path algorithm. We conduct experiments on a real-world check-in dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.",

        "abstract": "A verification code is an automated test method used to distinguish between humans and computers. Humans can easily identify verification codes, whereas machines cannot. With the development of convolutional neural networks, automatically recognizing a verification code is now possible for machines. However, the advantages of convolutional neural networks depend on the data used by the training classifier, particularly the size of the training set. Therefore, identifying a verification code using a convolutional neural network is difficult when training data are insufficient. This study proposes an active and deep learning strategy to obtain new training data on a special verification code set without manual intervention. A feature learning model for a scene with less training data is presented in this work, and the verification code is identified by the designed convolutional neural network. Experiments show that the method can considerably improve the recognition accuracy of a neural network when the amount of initial training data is small.",

Do buggy files tend to stay buggy, or can they be redeemed? This paper analyzes the behaviour of the FixCache algorithm on four open source projects.

The new metrics represent a project as a graph with classes being vertices and dependencies between classes being edges. The importance of a class is evaluated in the whole structure of the project, and the significance metrics for software change-proneness prediction are then proposed. Six open source software projects are used to validate the new metrics. Data used in experiments include two parts. The first part is metric of each class, including 4 volume metrics, 6 complexity metrics and 2 significance metrics, and the second part is the number of changed lines of each class during the selected history period. Experimental results show that when the new metrics are combined with other metrics, the accuracy increases on 5 projects by 1.16% on average, and the area under ROC curve increases on 6 projects by 3.65% on average.",

        "abstract": "The class imbalance problems have been reported to severely hinder classification performance of many standard learning algorithms, and have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers of different fields. Therefore, a number of methods, such as sampling methods, cost-sensitive learning methods, and bagging and boosting based ensemble methods, have been proposed to solve these problems. However, these conventional class imbalance handling methods might suffer from the loss of potentially useful information, unexpected mistakes or increasing the likelihood of overfitting because they may alter the original data distribution. Thus we propose a novel ensemble method, which firstly converts an imbalanced data set into multiple balanced ones and then builds a number of classifiers on these multiple data with a specific classification algorithm. Finally, the classification results of these classifiers for new data are combined by a specific ensemble rule. In the empirical study, different class imbalance data handling methods including three conventional sampling methods, one cost-sensitive learning method, six Bagging and Boosting based ensemble methods, our previous method EM1vs1 and two fuzzy-rule based classification methods were compared with our method. The experimental results on 46 imbalanced data sets show that our proposed method is usually superior to the conventional imbalance data handling methods when solving the highly imbalanced problems. HighlightsWe propose a novel ensemble method to handle imbalanced binary data.The method turns imbalanced data learning into multiple balanced data learning.Our method usually performs better than the conventional methods on imbalanced data.",

One of the most challenging issues for algorithm selection is how to characterize different data sets. Recently, we extracted the structural information of a data set to characterize itself. Although these kinds of characteristics work well in identifying similar data sets and recommending appropriate classification algorithms, the extraction method can only be applied to binary data sets and its performance is not high. Thus, in this paper, an improved data set characterization method is proposed to address these problems. For the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of the improved method on algorithm recommendation, the unsupervised learning method EM is employed to build the algorithm recommendation model. Extensive experiments with 17 different types of classification algorithms are conducted upon 84 public UCI data sets; the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recommending appropriate classification algorithm(s) for a given classification problem is of great significance and also one of the challenging problems in the field of data mining, which is usually viewed as a meta-learning problem. Multi-label learning has been adopted and validated to be an effective meta-learning method in classification algorithm recommendation. However, the multi-label learning method used in previous classification algorithm recommendation relies only on relationship between data sets and their direct neighbours, ignoring the impact of other data sets. In this paper, a new classification algorithm recommendation method based on link prediction between data sets and classification algorithms is proposed. Taking advantage of link prediction in heterogeneous networks, this method considers the impact of all data sets and makes full use of the interactions between data sets as well as between data sets and algorithms. Firstly, meta data of the training data sets is collected. And then a heterogeneous network called  DAR ( D ata and  A lgorithm  R elationship) Network  is constructed with the meta data. Finally, the link prediction technique is adopted to recommend appropriate algorithm(s) for a given data set on the basis of the  DAR Network . To evaluate the proposed link prediction-based recommendation method, extensive experiments with 131 data sets and 21 classification algorithms are conducted. Results of 5 performance measures indicate that the proposed method is more effective compared with the base line classification algorithm recommendation method and can be used in practice.",

This paper presents an analysis of programming language statement frequency in a large corpus of C, C++, and Java source code, comprised of more than 54 million lines of code. Across these languages, the top four work-performing statement types are Method/Function Call, Assignment, If, and Return. As compared to studies of Formula Translating System, Common Business Oriented Language and Programming Language One in the 1970s, the main change is the prevalence of method/function calls. Statement use frequency across languages is remarkably similar, and within each individual language, most statement types have a frequency distribution that occupies a small range. A more detailed examination of assignment and looping statement types shows that many assignments simply involve copying of data and that C++/Java use for statements more than C.

        "abstract": "Ensemble classification is one of representative learning techniques in the field of machine learning, which combines a set of single classifiers together aiming at achieving better classification performance. Not every arbitrary set of single classifiers can obtain a good ensemble classifier. The efficient and necessary condition to construct an accurate ensemble classifier is that the single classifiers should be accurate and diverse. In this paper, we first formally give the definitions of accurate and diverse classifiers and put forward metrics to quantify the accuracy and diversity of the single classifiers; afterwards, we propose a novel parameter-free method to pick up a set of accurate and diverse single classifiers for ensemble. The experimental results on real world data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method which could improve the performance of the representative ensemble classifier Bagging.",

The new curve has some features similar with Nordenu0027s curve, but there also exist some obvious differences. Benefit from a large number of projects, we also found the monthly effort statistical distribution and the typical value of each month.

        "abstract": "A new associative classification algorithm based on weighted voting (ACWV) is presented. ACWV takes advantage of two methods: the optimal rule method preferring high-quality rules and the voting method considering the majority of the rules. Moreover, the method takes into account both the length and convictions of rules to calculate their weights. First, ACWV builds a class-count FP-tree (called CCFP-tree) from the given historical data. After that, the weighted voting result for a new instance can be obtained from the CCFP-tree directly without storing, retrieving and sorting rules explicitly. The label of the class with maximal sum of weighted votes is then that of the new instance. Results of the experiments with 36 data sets selected from the UCI machine learning repository show that the proposed method has its advantages in comparison with previous methods in terms of classification accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Using classification methods to predict software defect proneness with static code attributes has attracted a great deal of attention. The class-imbalance characteristic of software defect data makes the prediction much difficult; thus, a number of methods have been employed to address this problem. However, these conventional methods, such as sampling, cost-sensitive learning, Bagging, and Boosting, could suffer from the loss of important information, unexpected mistakes, and overfitting because they alter the original data distribution. This paper presents a novel method that first converts the imbalanced binary-class data into balanced multiclass data and then builds a defect predictor on the multiclass data with a specific coding scheme. A thorough experiment with four different types of classification algorithms, three data coding schemes, and six conventional imbalance data-handling methods was conducted over the 14 NASA datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method with a one-against-one coding scheme is averagely superior to the conventional methods.",

        "abstract": "A software process model automatically recommendation framework is proposed.Different machine learning technologies are used to construct the recommendation models.Mutual impact analyses between process models and different project factors are performed.We found process models are responsible for defect count, defect severity and software change. Among many factors that influence the success of a software project, the software process model employed is an essential one. An improper process model will be time consuming, error-prone and cost expensive, and further lower the quality of software. Therefore, how to choose an appropriate software process model is a very important problem for software development. Current works focus on the selection criteria and often lead to subjective results. In this paper, we propose a software process model recommendation method, to help project managers choose the most appropriate software process model for a new project at an early stage of development process according to historical software engineering data. The proposed method casts the process model recommendation into a classification problem. It first evaluates the different combinations of the alternative classification and attribute selection algorithms, and the best one is used to build the recommendation model with historical software engineering data; then, the constructed recommendation model is used to predict process models for a new software project with only a few data. We also analyze the mutual impacts between process models and different types of project factors, to further help managers locate the most suitable process model. We found process models are also responsible for defect count, defect severity and software change. Experiments on the data sets from 37 different development teams of different countries show that the average recommendation accuracy of our method reaches up to 82.5%, which makes it potentially useful in practice.",

        "abstract": "Diurnal freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) occur in the spring and autumn in boreal wetlands as soil temperatures rise above freezing during the day and fall below freezing at night. A surge in methane emissions from these systems is frequently documented during spring FTCs, accounting for a large portion of annual emissions. In boreal wetlands, methane is produced as a result of syntrophic microbial processes, mediated by a consortium of fermenting bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Further research is needed to determine whether FTCs enhance microbial metabolism related to methane production through the cryogenic decomposition of soil organic matter. Previous studies observed large methane emissions during the spring thawed period in the Sanjiang seasonal frozen marsh of Northeast China. To investigate how FTCs impact the soil microbial community and methanogen abundance and activity, we collected soil cores from the Sanjiang marsh during the FTCs of autumn 2014 and spring 2015. Methanogens were investigated based on expression level of the methyl coenzyme reductase (mcrA) gene, and soil bacterial and archaeal community structures were assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results show that a decrease in bacteria and methanogens followed autumns FTCs, whereas an increase in bacteria and methanogens was observed following spring FTCs. The bacterial community structure, including Firmicutes and certain Deltaproteobacteria, was changed following autumn FTCs. Temperature and substrate were the primary factors regulating the abundance and composition of the microbial communities during autumn FTCs, whereas no factors significantly contributing to spring FTCs were identified. Acetoclastic methanogens from order Methanosarcinales were the dominant group at the beginning and end of both the autumn and spring FTCs. Active methanogens were significantly more abundant during the diurnal thawed period, indicating that the increasing number of FTCs predicted to occur with global climate change could potentially promote CH emissions in seasonal frozen marshes.",

However, the key factors that orchestrate HSC activities during physiological stresses remain largely unknown. Here we report that Med23 controls the myeloid potential of activated HSCs. Ablation of Med23 in hematopoietic system leads to lymphocytopenia. Med23-deficient HSCs undergo myeloid-biased differentiation and lose the self-renewal capacity. Interestingly, Med23-deficient HSCs are much easier to be activated in response to physiological stresses. Mechanistically, Med23 plays essential roles in maintaining stemness genes expression and suppressing myeloid lineage genes expression. Med23 is downregulated in HSCs and Med23 deletion results in better survival under myeloablative stress. Altogether, our findings identify Med23 as a gatekeeper of myeloid potential of HSCs, thus providing unique insights into the relationship among Med23-mediated transcriptional regulations, the myeloid potential of HSCs and HSC activation upon stresses.",

This unique function is established during iNKT cell development; the detailed mechanisms of this process, however, remain to be elucidated. Here the authors show that deletion of the mediator subunit Med23 in CD4CD8 double positive (DP) thymocytes completely blocks iNKT cell development at stage 2. This dysregulation is accompanied by a bias in the expression of genes related to the regulation of transcription and metabolism, and functional impairment of the cells including the loss of NK cell characteristics, reduced ability to secrete cytokines and attenuated recruitment capacity upon activation. Moreover, Med23-deficient iNKT cells exhibit impaired anti-tumor activity. Our study identifies Med23 as an essential transcriptional regulator that controls iNKT cell differentiation and terminal maturation.",

Although many changes of T-cell receptor-associated signalling molecules affect T-cell activation, the transcriptional mechanisms that control this process remain largely unknown. Here we find that T cell-specific deletion of the mediator subunit Med23 leads to hyperactivation of T cells and aged Med23-deficient mice exhibit an autoimmune syndrome. Med23 specifically and consistently promotes the transcription of multiple negative regulators of T-cell activation. In the absence of Med23, the T-cell activation threshold is lower, which results in enhanced antitumour T-cell function. Cumulatively, our data suggest that Med23 contributes to controlling T-cell activation at the transcriptional level and prevents the development of autoimmunity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A new member of the WD repeat protein family, named GhWD40, was cloned from a near-isogenic line for glands in cotton. It has 2629 bp cDNA and a complete opening reading frame (ORF) of 1239 bp, containing the initial code (ATG) and terminal code (TAG); there is a 1061 bp non-coding sequence at the 5\u2032-end, and a 329 bp non-coding sequence at the 3\u2032-end, including the poly(A) sequence (accession number: JN714279). The predicted protein of the complete ORF comprised 412 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47.1 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.88. Protein domain scanning showed that the novel protein has five wd40 motifs and belongs to the WD40 family. From a search for GhWD40 cDNA and amino acid sequences in the database, it has 77% sequence identity and was 90% sequence positive with the WD-40 repeat protein from Trifolium pratense (accession number BAE71307.1), and 80% sequence identity and 89% sequence positivity with the ribosome biogenesis protein bop1 from Ricinus communis (accession number XP 002529002.1). We propose that GhWD40 may play the same role as bop1. In addition, expression of GhWD40 in near-isogenic lines 11 and 3 (with and without glands, respectively) was studied by quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction, and the level in near-isogenic line 11 was higher than that in near-isogenic line 3, suggesting that GhWD40 may be related to gland formation.",

        "abstract": "Sugars are the most abundant organic compounds produced by plants, and can be used to build carbon skeleton and generate energy. The sugar accumulation 1 (OsSAC1) gene encodes a protein with an unknown function that exhibits four N-terminal transmembrane regions and two conserved domains DUF4220 and DUF594 with unknown functions. OsSAC1 was found poorly and specifically expressed at the bottoms of young leaves and in the developing leaf sheathes. Subcellular location results showed that OsSAC1 was co-localized with ER:mCherry and targeted the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). OsSAC1 has been found to affect sugar partitioning in rice (Oryza sativa). I2/KI starch staining, ultrastructure observations, and starch content measurements indicated that more and larger starch granules accumulated in ossac1 source leaves than in wild-type (WT) source leaves. Additionally, higher sucrose and glucose concentrations accumulated in the ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves. Whereas, lower sucrose and glucose concentrations were observed in the ossac1 young leaves and developing leaf sheathes than those of the WT. Extremely more OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1 (responsible for starch synthesis) expression and significantly less OscFBP1, OscFBP2, OsSPS1, and OsSPS11 (responsible for sucrose synthesis) and OsSWEET11, OsSWEET14, and OsSUT1 (responsible for sucrose loading) expression occurred in ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves. More rice plasmodesmata negative regulator OsGSD1 was detected in ossac1 young leaves and developing leaf sheathes than in those of the WT. These results suggest that ER targeted OsSAC1 may indirectly regulate sugar partitioning in carbon-demanding young leaves and developing leaf sheathes.",

Reduction in yield and quality of rice will cause direct economic losses to farmers, and even insufficient food supply worldwide. Elucidation of the molecular mechanism of premature senescence is important for the genetic improvement of rice. The rice mutant ossac3 (sugar accumulating 3) characterized in this study was raised from seeds of the indica maintainer line Xinong 1B treated with ethyl methanesulfonate. The mutant showed premature leaf senescence associated with excessive starch accumulation in the leaf. Under field conditions, the mutant showed the early senescence phenotype at the seedling stage. Apart from newly developing leaves, the leaves began to turn yellow from the leaf tip extending to the middle of the leaf, and the base of the leaves was pale green. The mutant phenotype was maintained to maturity. Compared to the wild type, photosynthetic pigment content and photosynthetic rate in leaves of the mutant were significantly decreased. Concentrations of reactive oxygen species were significantly increased, antioxidant enzyme activities were significantly reduced, and all analyzed agronomic traits decreased in the mutant. Iodine-potassium iodide staining and starch content analysis showed that starch accumulated in ossac3 leaves. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed changes in the expression levels of starch metabolism-related genes. The mutant phenotype was controlled by a pair of recessive nuclear genes and ossac3 was localized on chromosome 3 between the markers RM15243 and HJY8 with a physical distance of 374.2 kb.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) is a powerful tool for combining quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with the pyramiding of desirable alleles. The rice CSSL Z1364 with increased kernel number was identified in a BC 3 F 8  population derived from a cross of Nipponbare as the recipient with Xihui 18 as the donor parent. Z1364 carried three substitution segments distributed on chromosomes 1, 6, and 8. The mean substitution length was 1.19\u202fMb. Of 17 QTL identified on the substitution segments,  qSP1  for spikelets per panicle,  qSSD1  for seed-set density, and  qNSB1  for number of secondary branches explained respectively 57.34%, 87.7%, and 49.44% of the corresponding phenotypic variance and were all linked to RM6777. Chi-square analysis showed that the increased kernel number in Z1364 was inherited recessively by a single gene. By fine mapping,  qSP1  was delimited to a 50-kb region on the short arm of chromosome 1. Based on DNA sequence, a previously uncharacterized rice homolog of  Arabidopsis thaliana AT4G32551  was identified as a candidate gene for  qSP1  in which mutation increases the number of spikelets and kernels in Z1364.  qSP1  was expressed in all tissues, but particularly in 1-cm panicles. The expression levels of  OsMADS22 ,  GN1A , and  DST  were upregulated and those of  LAX2 ,  GNP1 , and  GHD7  were downregulated in Nipponbare. These results provide a foundation for functional research on  qSP1 .",

        "abstract": "Cotton Verticillium wilt is a serious soil-borne vascular disease that causes great economic loss each year. However, due to the lack of resistant varieties of upland cotton, the molecular mechanisms of resistance to this disease, especially to the pathogen Verticillium dahliae, remain unclear.We used the RNA-seq method to research the molecular mechanisms of cotton defence responses to different races of Verticillium dahliae by comparing infected sea-island cotton and upland cotton. A total of 77,212 unigenes were obtained, and the unigenes were subjected to BLAST searching and annotated using the GO and KO databases. Six sets of digital gene expression data were mapped to the reference transcriptome. The gene expression profiles of cotton infected with Verticillium dahliae were compared to those of uninfected cotton; 44 differentially expressed genes were identified. Regarding genes involved in the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, the hydroxycinnamoyl transferase gene (HCT) was upregulated in upland cotton whereas PAL, 4CL, CAD, CCoAOMT, and COMT were upregulated in sea-island cotton. Almost no differentially expressed genes in this pathway were identified in sea-island cotton and upland cotton when they were infected with V. dahliae V991 and V. dahliae D07038, respectively.Our comprehensive gene expression data at the transcription level will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the cotton defence response to V. dahliae. By identifying the genes involved in the defence response of each type of cotton to V. dahliae, our data not only provide novel molecular information for researchers, but also help accelerate research on genes involved in defences in cotton.",

The CAP is a combinatorial problem in nature and needs effective solution methods. The importance measures of components, e.g., the Birnbaum importance (BI), evaluate the relative strength of a component to system reliability, and can be used in aid to tackle the CAP. This paper studies the competence of the BI in solving the CAP. It proposes some BI-based heuristic methods for the CAP, and evaluates and compares the BI-based heuristics, including the new ones and the existing ones, through comprehensive numerical experiments. It is demonstrated that the heuristics using the BI can solve the CAP satisfactorily and the new heuristics are superior to the existing ones under some situations. Through the analysis to the computational results, this paper suggests a two-phase procedure for solving the CAP, and each phase uses different BI-based heuristics.",

To solve the CAP, an important type of problems in reliability, we propose a Birnbaum-importance based genetic local search (BIGLS) algorithm in which a local search using the Birnbaum importance is embedded into the genetic algorithm. This paper presents comprehensive numerical tests to compare the performance of the BIGLS with a general genetic algorithm and a Birnbaum-importance based two-stage heuristic. The testing results show that the BIGLS is robust (with respect to its random operations) and effective, and outperforms two benchmark methods in terms of solution quality.

However, the development of functionally artificial bases can result in the generation of new biomaterials with unique properties and applications. Therefore, we herein report the design and synthesis of a photoresponsive base as a new functional or molecular \"element\" for constructing DNA nanomolecules. The new base is made by fusion of an azobenzene with a natural T base (zT). zT, a new molecular element, is not only the most size-expanded T analogue but also a photoresponsive base capable of specific self-assembly through hydrogen bonding. Our results showed that stable and selective self-assembly of double-stranded DNAs occurred through zT-A base pairing, but it could still be efficiently dissociated by light irradiation. The photoresponsive DNA bases will provide the versatility required for constructing desired DNA nanomolecules and nanodevices.",

The redox balance between reducing and oxidizing species within cells is significant in the regulation of a signal pathway and is achieved by a series of elaborate mechanisms. In this work, we employed our previously reported D-\u03c0-A-structured naphthalene-BODIPY TBET platform to design an efficient two-photon fluorescent probe for dynamic monitoring of superoxide anion oxidative stress and the GSH reducing repair process. The probe displayed high energy transfer efficiency (91.4%), large pseudo-Stokes shifts upon one-photon excitation, and red fluorescence emission (\u03bb = 596 nm), which is highly desirable for bioimaging applications. The probe exhibits reversibility, rapid response, good photostability, high selectivity and sensitivity for the superoxide anion and GSH. More importantly, the probe was successfully applied for visualizing the redox changes in living cells and tissues.",

        "abstract": "Acute organ injury observed during sepsis, caused by an uncontrolled release of inflammatory mediators, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is quite fatal. The development of efficient methods for early diagnosis of sepsis and LPS-induced acute organ injury in living systems is of great biomedical importance. In living systems, cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE) can be overexpressed due to LPS, and H2Sn can be formed by CSE-mediated cysteine metabolism. Thus, acute organ injury during sepsis may be correlated with H2Sn levels, making accurate detection of H2Sn in living systems of great physiological and pathological significance. In this work, our previously reported fluorescent platform was employed to design and synthesize a FRET-based ratiometric two-photon (TP) fluorescent probe TPR-S, producing a large emission shift in the presence of H2Sn. In this work, a naphthalene derivative two-photon fluorophore was chosen as the energy donor; a rhodol derivative fluorophore served as the acceptor. The 2-fluoro-5-nitr...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes have been considered as powerful tools for exploring bioactive species and biological processes in living systems by virtue of the substantial merits of the NIR window (such as minimal photo-toxicity, deep tissue penetration, and low background interference). However, the development of effective NIR fluorescent probes for biological application is still facing great challenges due to some weakness (for example, pH sensitivity, poor chemical and photo-stability) of mainly current NIR fluorophores. Herein, we synthesized a novel fluorine atom substituted NIR chromenylium-cyanine fluorophore, termed  CCF-OH , with an optically tunable hydroxyl group. Compound  CCF-OH  possess several optical advantages, including high chemical stability, high photo-stability, and high fluorescence quantum yield (\u03a6\u202f=\u202f0.47). Significantly, a low pK a  value (6.3) of  CCF-OH  was obtained, making its fluorescence signal steady around the pH ranging from 6.8 to 8.1. To demonstrate the practicability of  CCF-OH , a mitochondria-targeted near-infrared fluorescent probe,  N-Cys , was developed by masking the hydroxyl group of  CCF-OH  with an acrylate group as the recognition unit for cysteine (Cys).  N-Cys  responded to Cys with an obvious ratiometric signal. Furthermore,  N-Cys  has also been successfully applied for ratiometric NIR imaging of Cys in living cells, suggesting the great potential of the new NIR fluorophore,  CCF-OH , for practical applications in living systems.",

The probe can be applied to the quantification of hydrogen peroxide with a linear range from 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol L\u22121. The detection limit of probe 1 toward H2O2 was estimated to be 0.7 \u03bcM. Furthermore, probe 1 was found to have a much higher selectivity for H2O2 than other reactive oxygen species and successfully applied to cell imaging of hydrogen peroxide using two-photon microscopy in living cells. The superior properties of the probe made it highly promising for use in chemical and biological applications.",

        "abstract": "New hybrid halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were obtained by grafting conjugated polyfluorenes (PFs) onto the surface via \u201cclick\u201d chemistry. The hybrid material can be dispersed in organic solvent such as dichloromethane, and exhibits intense blue emission peaked at 448\u00a0nm. The absorption and emission spectra of the HNTs show distinct bathochromic shifts compared to PFs, which can be attributed to the extended \u03c0-conjugation as a result of the cycloaddition of azide and alkyne groups. The changes of the spectra also show that the PFs were grafted onto the HNTs through chemical bonds. Thermal gravimetric analyzer data show one more significant result, the grafting degree of the HNTs is 150\u00a0%, which means that a high mass ratio of PF polymers was grafted onto the HNTs. Furthermore, characterizations by infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also support the conclusion. The combination of HNTs with conjugated polymers will lead to a new generation of donor\u2013acceptor nanohybrid materials which are promising in application in photoelectric fields.",

The primary focus of the burn-in test in this study is to eliminate the initial rapid degradation phase, while the major purpose of traditional burn-in tests is to detect and eliminate early failures from weak units. A hierarchical Bayesian bi-exponential model is used to capture two-phase degradation patterns of the burn-in population. Mission reliability and total cost are introduced as planning criteria. The proposed burn-in approach accounts for unit-to-unit variability within the burn-in population, and uncertainty concerning the model parameters, mainly in the hierarchical Bayesian framework. Available pre-burn-in data is conveniently incorporated into the burn-in decision-making procedure. A practical example of PDP degradation data is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. The proposed method is compared to other approaches such as the maximum likelihood method or the change-point regression.",

We collect data and propose to adopt the generalized proportional intensities model (GPIM) to analyze the supercomputer interrupts as the GPIM can capture both the reliability parameters and maintenance parameters and allows the inclusion of both emergency and preventive maintenance.

        "abstract": "Abstract   With the rapid development of technologies and the consequent emergence of new business modes, products such as smart phones and personal computers have come to have relatively short lifecycles. As a result, products are designed, produced, and sold to accommodate the shorter lifecycles. From a practical point of view, the sales of products are assumed to have two phases: regular sales and promotions/disposal. In this paper, we propose an optimization model to jointly design and determine product reliability, warranty policy, regular price, promotion price, and lengths of regular sales and promotions. These decision variables are correlated and influence the quantity of sales, the cost of research and development, the production cost, the warranty cost, and ultimately the total profit attainable from launching a new product. We investigate and compare four nonrenewable warranty policies, i.e., free replacement, free minimal repair, pro-rata replacement, and pro-rata minimal repair. Numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis provide the managerial insights into the influences of promotion, product reliability, prices, warranty, and sales period on sales quantity and total profit.",

        "abstract": "In a repairable system with multiple functionally interchangeable components, the components may work in different environmental or operational stresses associated with their positions, and thus, experience different failure rates and nonhomogeneous degradation processes. For such a system, the system lifetime can be improved by reassigning the components among the positions in the system after a period of operation. In this sense, the component reallocation (CR) is an option of preventive maintenances. This paper studies a new maintenance policy, which performs periodic preventive system replacements and periodic preventive CRs between system replacements as well as minimal repairs for emergency failures. An optimization model is established to determine the time and assignment for CRs and the time for system replacements with the objective of minimizing expected annual system maintenance cost. The model also justifies if the CR is economically beneficial and deserved to be implemented. The proposed CR-based maintenance policy is further specified for exponential component lifetime distributions and Rayleigh lifetime distributions, and analytical results are derived. Finally, numerical examples for general Weibull lifetime distributions are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and insights of CRs in maintenance.",

The data storage system of a supercomputer consists of hundreds of storage nodes, and each storage node contains several independently and identically distributed nonrepairable hard disks (HDs). Based on the data storage mechanism of the HDs and the failure mechanism of the storage nodes, the k-out-of-n:F system is used to model the data storage nodes. The lifetime of all HDs is assumed to be exponentially distributed. The age-based PM policy is to replace the failed HDs every PM interval or upon system failure. We establish an optimization model to identify the optimal PM interval with the goal of minimizing the long-run average cost while meeting the requirements for system reliability. Our numerical case study shows the application of the present model and method, and analyzes the relationship between the long-run average cost and PM interval.",

        "abstract": "Jumonji domain-containing protein 6 (JMJD6) is a homolog of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) asparaginyl hydroxylase, an inhibitor of HIF. HIF-1\u03b1 is known to participate in neuropathic pain (NPP) during chronic constriction injury (CCI); however, the roles of JMJD6 in NPP have not been systematically investigated. In this study, we examined the temporal distribution and cellular location of JMJD6 in the spinal cord during CCI. In addition, we assessed behavioral changes representative of NPP in rats. Following CCI, lentiviral vectors (LV-JMJD6) were intrathecally administered to observe the changes in the expression of JMJD6, HIF-1\u03b1, and its downstream factor caspase-3. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to detect potential interactions between JMJD6 and HIF-1\u03b1. We found that JMJD6 was decreased in rats following CCI, which was accompanied by significant NPP-associated behavioral changes. JMJD6 was mainly expressed in neurons. Intrathecal injection of LV-JMJD6 following CCI alleviated the thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, normalized JMJD6 protein expression, and decreased HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression with a corresponding reduction in caspase-3 protein expression. Furthermore, the co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that JMJD6 and HIF-1\u03b1 protein immunoprecipitated with each other, indicating an interaction between these two proteins. Taken together, the results suggest that JMJD6 may serve as a sensor in neurons of the adult rat spinal cord during the CCI state. Furthermore, JMJD6 may exert its function in NPP by regulating HIF-1\u03b1 in rats exposed to CCI.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal inflammation induces long-term effects on brain function. We investigated the effects of systematic neonatal inflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection at postnatal day 3 (P3) and P5 in a mouse model of spatial memory capacity measured using a Morris water maze (MWM) task in adulthood. Subsequently, we assessed histone acetylation and immediate-early response gene expression (c-Fos and brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the hippocampus in response to MWM acquisition training. The LPS-treated mice exhibited a significant spatial cognitive impairment, which was accompanied by insufficient histone acetylation of the H4K12 specific lysine residue and repressed c-Fos gene expression immediately after acquisition training. Moreover, the enrichment of acetyl-H4K12 on the c-Fos promoter following acquisition training was decreased in LPS-treated mice. Administration of trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, 2 h before each MWM acquisition training session effectively enhanced hippocampal histone acetylation levels and enrichment of acetyl-H4K12 on the c-Fos promoter following acquisition training in LPS-treated mice. TSA also increased c-Fos gene expression underlying synaptic plasticity and memory formation, and consequently rescued impaired spatial cognitive function. These results indicate that the dysregulation of H4K12 acetylation during the ongoing process of memory formation plays a key role in the spatial cognitive impairment associated with a neonatal LPS challenge. The histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA exhibits therapeutic potential for treating cognitive impairment induced by neonatal inflammation, by means of improving hippocampal histone acetylation and downstream c-Fos gene expression in response to a learning task.",

        "abstract": "Treatment of neuropathic pain (NPP) continues to be a major challenge, and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Previous studies have demonstrated that histone methylation is important in synaptic plasticity of the nervous system and may affect nuclear factor\u2011\u03baB (NF\u2011\u03baB) signaling through epigenetic mechanisms. The present study aimed to investigate the role of Jumonji C domain 6 (JMJD6), a histone demethylase, in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of NPP. On the third day post\u2011CCI surgery, a JMJD6 overexpressing lentiviral vector (LV\u2011JMJD6) was intrathecally injected in the rats. Mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency were assessed prior surgery and on days 3, 7, 10 and 14 post\u2011CCI. The results showed that intrathecal injection with the LV\u2011JMJD6 attenuated CCI\u2011induced pain facilitation. The expression of JMJD6 was lower following CCI surgery, and its expression was significantly increased following intrathecal injection with LV\u2011JMJD6, compared with levels in normal saline (NS)\u2011 and negative control lentiviral vector (NC)\u2011treated rats. The expression of spinal NF\u2011\u03baB phosphorylated (p\u2011)p65 subunit and its downstream pain\u2011associated effectors, including interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL\u20111\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 (TNF\u2011\u03b1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were increased following CCI surgery. Intrathecal injection with LV\u2011JMJD6 suppressed activation of the p\u2011p65 subunit in CCI rats. In addition, expression levels of its downstream effectors IL\u20111\u03b2, TNF\u2011\u03b1 and VEGF were attenuated by intrathecal treatment with LV\u2011JMJD6, compared with those in the NS\u2011 and NC\u2011treated CCI rats. Furthermore, the JMJD6\u2011 and p65\u2011immunoreactive cells overlapped in the spinal dorsal horn, however, co\u2011immunoprecipitation showed that JMJD6 and the NF\u2011\u03baB p65 subunit did not directly interact, indicating other functional connections may exist between these factors following CCI surgery. Collectively, these findings indicated an important mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of NPP. JMJD6 may exert its therapeutic function in NPP by regulating NF\u2011\u03baB following CCI.",

The sciatic nerve CCI model of SD rat and JMJD6 lentiviral expression vector were constructed. On the third day after CCI, the intrathecal catheter was prepared, and 20 \u03bcL of normal saline and lentivirus-containing reagent (virus titer 1\u00d7108 TU/mL) were administered. The rats' paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT) and paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) were monitored, and Western blotting was used to detect the expression of Wnt3a and NR2B protein in the spinal cord. Co-immunoprecipitation was applied to detect the interaction between JMJD6 and Wnt3a.\u2029 Results: Compared with the sham group, the PWMT of the rats in each group after CCI was significantly decreased and the PWTL was significantly shortened (P<0.05). Compared with the CCI group and the CCI+LV-NC group, PWMT in the CCI+LV-JMJD6 group was increased significantly on the 10th day and the 14th day after CCI, and the PWTL was significantly prolonged on the 14th day after CCI (P<0.05). On the 14th day after CCI, the expression levels of Wnt3a and NR2B in the CCI group and the CCI+LV-NC group were significantly higher than those in the sham group. After intrathecal injection of lentiviral vector, Wnt3a and NR2B protein expression levels in the CCI+LV-JMJD6 group were lower compared with the CCI+LV-NC group (P<0.05). The results of co-immunoprecipitation showed no direct interaction between Wnt3a and JMJD6.\u2029 Conclusion: Wnt3a is involved in mediating neuropathic pain, and its effect may be related to the epigenetic modification of JMJD6, which is likely regulated through indirect interaction.",

QoS requirement with uncertain parameters has become a very important research issue in MANET. The paper presents a multi- constraint QoS Routing protocol with Route-Request Selection based on Mobile Predicting (QRRSMP). The QRRSMP is the scalable routing algorithm whose control overhead should be under control to keep up with increasing offered load. In this algorithm, the goal is to construct a stable QoS routing path and reduce the number of Route-Request (RREQ) packet by forwarding or discarding RREQ packets.

Multiple QoS constraints is one in which the delay, delay jitter, bandwidth and cost should satisfied the prespecified bounds. The paper discusses the QoS routing problem with multiple QoS constraints, deals with the delay, delay jitter, bandwidth and cost metrics. It presents a multiple QoS constraints routing protocol with mobile predicting (MQRPMP).The MQRPMP attempts to reduce the overhead for reconstructing a routing path with multiple QoS constraints by mobile predicting. In this paper, the proof of correctness of MQRPMP is also given. The simulation results show that the MQRPMP approach provides an accurate and efficient method of estimating and evaluating the QoS routing stability in dynamic mobile networks. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "QoS routing has been a very important research issue in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). In this paper, we proposes a QoS-Aware routing protocol based on entropy (QARPE) for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks. QARPE can provide stable mutil-path routing strategy. The strategy adhibits the entropy metric to guarantee the stability and QoS conditions of selected routing. The paper adopts the following QoS conditions: delay, bandwidth and delay jitter. In order to reduce the number of route reconstructions as few as possible, QARPE provides a standby route. Therefore, when the main route is invalid, the source can transmit data by the standby routie.The simulation results shows that QARPE approach provides an accurate and efficient method with a stable multi-path and satisfies QoS constrains in MANETs.",

        "abstract": "Network coding (NC) can prove to be particularly useful in multimedia streaming applications, where it could help to increase the network throughput and data persistence in Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET). Sliding-window Network Coding is a variation of NC that is an addition to multimedia streaming and improves the data delay on MANETs. In this paper, we propose a Sliding Window Network Coding for free Viewpoint Multimedia streaming in MANETs (SWNC-VM). SWNC-VM preserves the degree distribution of the encoded packets through the recombination at the nodes. SWNC-VM enables to control the decoding complexity of each sliding-window independently from the packets received and recover the original data. The performance of the SWNC-VM is studied using NS2 and evaluated in terms of the encoding overhead, decoding delay, packet loss probability and throughput when a packet is transmitted. The simulations result shows that the SWNC-VM with our proposition can significantly improve the network throughput and encoding efficiency.",

A total of 45 crossbred pigs were randomly assigned to three groups of 15 pigs, five replicates of three animals comprised each group. Pigs were allocated to diets that contained 5 mg/kg copper (as the control group), 125 mg/kg copper sulfate, or 125 mg/kg copper methionine. At the end of the experiment, five pigs were selected at random from each group, slaughtered, and collected the fundic gland for determination of ghrelin mRNA expression level. The results showed that average daily gain, average daily feed intake, absolute weight, serum growth hormone (GH) concentration, and ghrelin mRNA level were higher in pigs fed the diets with 125 mg/kg copper methionine and 125 mg/kg copper sulfate (P\u2009<\u20090.05), than in pigs fed a diet with 5 mg/kg copper. These data suggest that high dietary copper (125 mg/kg) appears to increase feed intake and promote weight gain by enhancing the secretion of GH and ghrelin mRNA level in growing pigs.",

        "title": "Influence of Dietary Copper on Serum Growth-Related Hormone Levels and Growth Performance of Weanling Pigs",
        "abstract": "Abstract To investigate the effect of dietary copper on serum growth-related hormones levels and growth performance, a total of 60 weanling pigs were randomly assigned to six groups each containing 10 pigs, fed on basal diets supplemented with 0 (control), 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mg/kg copper sulfate for 80 days, respectively. The average daily gain (ADG), feed to gain ratio (F/G), feed intake and serum growth hormone (GH), insulin (INS), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels were detected at interval of 20 days. The results revealed that ADG, and serum GH, INS, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 concentrations were increased significantly in the pigs fed on diets added with 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mg/kg copper sulfate. Meanwhile, in the pigs supplemented with 250 mg/kg copper sulfate, ADG was increased significantly from the 40th to the 60th day of the experiment (P\u2009<\u20090.01), and the levels of GH, INS, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 in serum were elevated significantly from the 20th to the 40th day of the experiment (P\u2009<\u20090.01). It is concluded that effects of copper supplemented in the diet on the growth of pigs were related to the increasing levels of GH, INS, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 in serum which were induced by copper. High dietary copper increase the concentrations of growth-related hormones in serum, resulting in improving the growth performance of weanling pigs.",

        "abstract": "Strontium (Sr) can reduce cartilage degeneration and stimulate cartilage matrix formation. Angiogenesis plays a developmental role in chondrogenesis, and was stimulated by growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). However, the direct influence of Sr on VEGF and FGF2 expressions in chondrocytes is not entirely clear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different Sr concentrations on VEGF and FGF2 expressions in rat chondrocytes in vitro. Chondrocytes were isolated from Wistar rat articular by enzymatic digestion. As a Sr source, strontium chloride hexahydrate (SrCl\u00b76HO) was added to the culture solution at final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 20.0, and 100.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. After 72\u00a0h of continuous culture, mRNA abundance and protein expression levels of VEGF and FGF2 in the chondrocytes were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The results showed that VEGF and FGF2 expressions were dose-dependently elevated with Sr concentration in chondrocytes. The mRNA abundance and protein expression levels of VEGF were extremely significantly higher than those in the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.01) at 1.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Sr treatment. For FGF2, there were markedly significant differences in mRNA and protein expression from control group (P\u2009<\u20090.01) when the Sr-treated concentration exceeded 5.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 20.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. These results indicated that Sr might involve in the cartilage angiogenesis via regulating expression of VEGF and FGF2z.",

In order to understand the mechanisms involved in these processes, the chondrocytes were isolated from Wistar rat articular cartilage by enzymatic digestion and cultured under standard conditions. They were then treated with strontium at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 20.0 and 100.0 \u03bcg/mL for 72 h. The mRNA abundance and protein expression levels of ALP and BMP-4 were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and Western blot analysis. The results showed that the levels of expression of ALP and BMP-4 in chondrocytes increased as the concentration of strontium increased relative to the control group, and the difference became significant at 1.0 \u03bcg/mL strontium (P<0.05).

Catalytic chlorination of glycerol to 1,3-DCP is an alternative to propylene chlorination. The catalytic activities of various aliphatic carboxylic acid catalysts for the catalytic chlorination of glycerol with HCl to 1,3-DCP were investigated. When monocarboxylic acids, such as acetic, propanoic, butyric, and hexylic acids, were used as the catalysts, the monocarboxylic acids with the carbon numbers of 3 and 4 favored the glycerol chlorination to 1,3-DCP. When dicarboxylic acids, such as oxalic, malonic, succinic, and adipic acids, were used as the catalysts, the dicarboxylic acids with long carbon chain favored the glycerol chlorination to 1,3-DCP. The highest yield of 1,3-DCP of 88.6% was obtained over adipic acid catalyst after reacting at 110\u2009\u00b0C for 14\u2009h. When hydroxylcarboxylic acids, such as citric, malic, and lactic acids, were used as the catalysts, the 1,3-DCP yields were approximately half of those over monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acid catalysts with the same carbon number, respectively. The steric hindrance effect of carboxylic acids played an important role in glycerol chlorination to 1,3-DCP as compared with their acid strengths. \u00a9 2015 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley u0026 Sons, Ltd.",

The crystallinities of the zeolite K-L catalysts increased with increasing the SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio of reaction solution and prolonging the autoclaving time. Nanosized and well-dispersed zeolite K-L catalysts were synthesized when the SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio was more than 26:1. Well-crystallized and nanosized zeolite K-L catalysts showed high catalytic activity for the chlorination of toluene to p-chlorotoluene. When the nanosized zeolite K-L catalyst was synthesized with the SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio of 31:1 at the autoclaving temperature of 150 \u00b0C for 96 h, the selectivities of p-chlorotoluene and o-chlorotoluene were 76.2% and 20.0%, respectively, at the complete conversion of toluene.",

        "abstract": "To meet the demand for the application of high activity and thermostable cellulases in the production of new-generation bioethanol from nongrain-cellulose sources, a hyperthermostable \u03b2-1,4-endoglucase Cel12B from Thermotoga maritima was selected for further modification by gene site-directed mutagenesis method in the present study, based on homology modeling and rational design. As a result, two recombinant enzymes showed significant improvement in enzyme activity by 77% and 87%, respectively, higher than the parental enzyme TmCel12B. Furthermore, the two mutants could retain 80% and 90.5% of their initial activity after incubation at 80\u00b0C for 8 h, while only 45% for 5 h to TmCel12B. The Km and Vmax of the two recombinant enzymes were 1.97\u00b10.05 mM, 4.23\u00b10.15 \u03bcmol\u00b7mg-1\u00b7min-1 of TmCel12B-E225H-K207G-D37V, and 2.97\u00b10.12 mM, 3.15\u00b10.21 \u03bcmol\u00b7mg-1\u00b7min-1 of TmCel12B-E225H-K207G, respectively, when using CMC-Na as the substrate. The roles of the mutation sites were also analyzed and evaluated in terms of electron density, hydrophobicity of the modeled protein structures. The recombinant enzymes may be used in the hydrolysis of cellulose at higher temperature in the future. It was concluded that the gene mutagenesis approach of a certain active residues may effectively improve the performance of cellulases for the industrial applications and contribute to the study the thermostable mechanism of thermophilic enzymes.",

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. High intensity discharge (HID) lamps have a small volume, high pressure and high luminance. This makes them very useful for illumination of large surface areas such as streets and stadiums. A numerical model is being set up in order to fully understand the energy balance and transport processes in such lamps. The model can be greatly simplified if the discharge of the HID lamp is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). LTE was experimentally investigated by determining the temperature of a model HID mercury lamp. This lamp has an arc length of 39 mm and an 18 mm diameter. It contains pure mercury and has no outer jacket. The validation of the LTE assumption requires the measurements of different temperatures. This was done using three different techniques. X-ray absorption (XRA) measures the heavy-particle temperature, Thomson scattering (TS) the electron temperature, absolute line intensity (ALI) measurements determine the excitation temperature. By comparing the different temperatures the LTE assumption can be validated. XRA uses an x-ray source, produced by a molybdenum anode, for the plane-wave illumination of the entire lamp. This is done for both lamp-on and off measurements. The Hg density distribution follows from the ratio of these, from which the heavy particle temperature can be determined using the ideal gas law. TS is the scattering of (laser) light on the electrons in the plasma. From the scattered photons the electron temperature and density can be determined. Emission spectroscopy (ALI) is used to determine the state density of mercury from the different optically thin lines. An atomic state distribution function (ASDF) then gives the excitation temperature. The TS temperature profile shows a relatively constant radial profile, whereas the XRA profile is parabolic. This is a clear indication of departure from LTE in the outer regions of the discharge.",

DNA methylation has been related to smoking, but genome-wide methylation data for smoking in Chinese populations is limited.Objectives:We aimed to investigate epigenome-wide methylation in relation to smoking in a Chinese population.Methods:We measured the methylation levels at u003e 485,000 CpG sites (CpGs) in DNA from leukocytes using a methylation array and conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis of DNA methylation and smoking in a total of 596 Chinese participants. We further evaluated the associations of smoking-related CpGs with internal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) biomarkers and their correlations with the expression of corresponding genes.Results:We identified 318 CpGs whose methylation levels were associated with smoking at a genome-wide significance level (false discovery rate u003c 0.05), among which 161 CpGs annotated to 123 genes were not associated with smoking in recent studies of Europeans and African Americans. Of these smoking-...",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is often a deadly disease due to the late diagnosis and chemoresistance that characterizes many cases of this disease. The aim of this study was to explore a panel of candidate cytokines as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for GC. Sixteen tissue samples of GC and adjacent noncancerous mucosa were selected from GC patients (n=8) for antibody microarray analysis. Proteomic chip-based analysis was performed to simultaneously identify 507 cytokines using a cytokine antibody array in the gastric tissues to screen for differential proteins related in cases of GC. Fold changes of protein expression >2.0 or <0.5 were considered significant. The proteins that showed significant differences in levels between the cancerous and non-cancerous samples were analyzed using bioinformatics analysis. One hundred and five cytokines that were significantly different (p<0.05) between GC tissues and normal gastric mucosa were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that these differentially expressed proteins are involved in many biological and immunological processes, mainly in response to stress, chloroplast thylakoid membrane, vacuole, photosynthesis, aspartic-type endopeptidase activity and flavin adenine dinucleotide binding. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated that these proteins mainly were involved in the process of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. These findings suggest that the differentially expressed proteins could be associated with GC in patients. Further study of these cytokines may provide a promising approach for diagnosis, classification and prognosis of GC.",

As compared to the BFO film with random orientations, the BFO film with a strong preferred orientation exhibits larger photovoltaic output as a result of its larger spontaneous polarization in the unpoled state. We further demonstrate that there is remarkable influence of external electric field poling on the photovoltage in the two polycrystalline BFO films, and the larger net change of the photovoltage after positive and negative poling in the highly preferred oriented BFO film is believed to be due to its improved crystalline structure. Our experiment results indicate that the responsiveness to external electric field and photovoltaic performance of the narrow-band-gap BFO film can be optimized by structural modification, making it possible to apply in the photosensitive and other optoelectronic devices.\n",

It proposes a pseudo-polynomial time, three-stage solution approach. Stages 1 (preprocessing) and 2 (setup) are implemented one time to transform RCSP into a shortest path problem, which is solved by stage 3 (iterative solution) at each column generation iteration, each time with different arc costs. This paper analyzes certain properties related to each stage as well as algorithm complexity. Computational tests compare the performances of this method, a state-of-the-art label-setting algorithm, and CPLEX optimization software on four classes of instances, each of which involves either one or multiple resources, and show that the new method is effective. The new method outperforms the label-setting algorithm when resource limitations are tight-as can be expected in practice, and outperforms CPLEX for all tested instances. The label-setting algorithm outperforms CPLEX for all single-resource RCSP instances and almost all multiple-resource RCSP instances.",

        "abstract": "The resource-constrained shortest-path problem (RCSP) is often used as a sub-problem in branch-and-price because it can model the complex logic by which many actual systems operate. This paper addresses two special issues that arise in such an application. First, RCSP in this context is dynamic in the sense that arc costs are updated at each column-generation iteration, but constraints are not changed. Often, only a few arc costs are updated at an iteration. Second, RCSP must be solved subject to arcs that are forbidden or prescribed as corresponding binary variables are fixed to 0 or 1 by the branching rule. A reoptimizing algorithm for dealing with a few arc-cost changes and a method for dealing with fixed arcs are proposed and incorporated into a three-stage approach, specializing it for repeatedly solving the dynamic RCSP as a sub-problem in branch-and-price. Computational tests evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The recently proposed concept of molecular connectivity maps enables researchers to integrate experimental measurements of genes, proteins, metabolites, and drug compounds under similar biological conditions. The study of these maps provides opportunities for future toxicogenomics and drug discovery applications. We developed a computational framework to build disease-specific drug-protein connectivity maps. We integrated gene/protein and drug connectivity information based on protein interaction networks and literature mining, without requiring gene expression profile information derived from drug perturbation experiments on disease samples. We described the development and application of this computational framework using Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as a primary example in three steps. First, molecular interaction networks were incorporated to reduce bias and improve relevance of AD seed proteins. Second, PubMed abstracts were used to retrieve enriched drug terms that are indirectly associated with AD through molecular mechanistic studies. Third and lastly, a comprehensive AD connectivity map was created by relating enriched drugs and related proteins in literature. We showed that this molecular connectivity map development approach outperformed both curated drug target databases and conventional information retrieval systems. Our initial explorations of the AD connectivity map yielded a new hypothesis that diltiazem and quinidine may be investigated as candidate drugs for AD treatment. Molecular connectivity maps derived computationally can help study molecular signature differences between different classes of drugs in specific disease contexts. To achieve overall good data coverage and quality, a series of statistical methods have been developed to overcome high levels of data noise in biological networks and literature mining results. Further development of computational molecular connectivity maps to cover major disease areas will likely set up a new model for drug development, in which therapeutic/toxicological profiles of candidate drugs can be checked computationally before costly clinical trials begin.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Central Tianshan Block is one of the major continental constituents of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) and contains vital information for understanding the amalgamation of the Eurasia continent. Its tectonic affinity remains controversial hindering a better reconstruction of the paleogeographic evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean and geodynamic processes of the CAOB. In order to put more constraints on the Precambrian basement composition and crustal evolution of the Central Tianshan Block, we conducted field structural investigations and zircon U-Pb dating on the meta-sedimentary and meta-igneous rocks along the Wulasitai \u2013 Wulanmoren ductile shear zone (WWSZ), northern Baluntai area (NW China). The WWSZ is geometrically a SE-NW-striking high-strain deformation zone of \u223c1\u20135\u202fkm wide. It is lithologically composed of greenschists, paragneiss, amphibolitic metabasalts, migmatitic granites and mylonitic granites. The greenschist to amphibolite facies meta-sandstones and meta-volcanic rocks belong to the Ahebulake Group, in which NE- or SW-dipping steep mylonitic foliations and sub-horizontal lineations are well developed. Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from four representative meta-sedimentary rocks from the Ahebulake Group yielded several major age groups of 3130\u20132530\u202fMa, 2450\u20132150\u202fMa, 2000\u20131700\u202fMa, 1620\u20131433\u202fMa, 1170\u2013655\u202fMa, \u223c450\u202fMa, \u223c425\u202fMa, \u223c400\u202fMa, \u223c360\u202fMa and \u223c312\u202fMa. Three ductilely deformed and metamorphosed granitic samples show four major zircon U-Pb age peaks at \u223c430\u202fMa, \u223c400\u2013390\u202fMa, \u223c360\u202fMa and \u223c330\u202fMa. On the basis of a careful analysis of the texture of the dated zircons and the structural features of their host rocks, and combined with the available isotopic ages and regional geological data, we propose that: (1) meta-sedimentary rocks from the Ahebulake Group were likely deposited later than about 400\u202fMa instead of in the Silurian, as previously assumed; (2) the distinct Neoproterozoic detrital zircon age population in these meta-sediments probably reflects the widespread occurrence of coeval in-situ basement rocks as source; (3) the Central Tianshan Block may have close tectonic affinities with both the Yili Block and the Tarim Craton during the Proterozoic; and (4) the ductile shearing along the WWSZ is likely later than \u223c330\u202fMa, probably initiated at \u223c312\u2013299\u202fMa. Our new results provide further arguments for the paleogeographic linkage of the microcontinents within the Paleo-Asian Ocean and tectonic reconstruction of the southwestern CAOB.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) was built by amalgamation of diverse geologic units including several microcontinents. The nature and geodynamic evolution of the Precambrian basement of these units are essential to constrain their origin, and thus the geodynamic and paleogeographic reconstruction of the accretionary system. The Yili Block, located in the west of the Chinese Tianshan Orogen, is one of these Precambrian-based continental constituents. Field investigations, zircon U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic analysis, whole-rock geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic studies were conducted on the gneissic granitoids from the Giergelang area, southern Yili Block. These rocks yielded early Neoproterozoic zircon U-Pb ages (962\u2013934\u202fMa), containing substantial number of Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic inherited zircons (2403\u20131268\u202fMa); their protoliths belong to peraluminous high-K granite series displaying right-declining REE patterns and Eu negative anomalies together with LILE (K, Rb, U, Th) enrichment and depletions in Ba, Nb, Sr, P, Ti; they have negative e Nd(t)  values ranging from \u22122.5 to \u22124.7, and old Nd model ages varying from 1650\u202fMa to 1910\u202fMa; they also exhibit highly variable zircon e Hf(t)  values (\u221212.1 to 4.4), and Hf-in-zircon model ages (1558\u20132574\u202fMa). Integrating all these results, it is suggested that the primary magma of gneissic granitoids was generated by partial melting of supracrustal rocks with involvement of old crustal materials.  A comparison of data from the Yili Block and its neighboring continental units reveals that the Neoproterozoic magmatic event is an important episode of crustal reworking for the major continental blocks within the CAOB. Similar Neoproterozoic magmatic events and comparable upper Neoproterozoic to lower Paleozoic stratigraphic sequences of the Yili, Chinese Central Tianshan and Tarim blocks, suggest that they had a similar crustal evolution and close tectonic and paleogeographic relation during Neoproterozoic, and were likely derived from one single continental plate.",

Among sampled FSWs over the 8 years, a higher proportion of older, married or cohabited, higher education levels and more on-call FSWs were observed in recent years. The syphilis prevalence increased significantly from 1.0 % in 2006 to 13.5 % in 2013, with illicit drug use rate ranging from 21.8 % in 2007 to 55.5 % in 2010. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that drug use, syphilis and unprotected vaginal sex predicted each other. The dual epidemics of illicit drug use and syphilis among FSWs underscore the urgency to implement a tailored intervention to curb the dual epidemics while also preventing an HIV epidemic in the context of diversified commercial sex dynamic.",

        "abstract": "The 90-90-90 targets recommended by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS require strengthening human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care, which includes diagnosis, linkage to and retention in care, assessment for treatment suitability, and optimization of HIV treatment. We sought to quantify patient engagement along the continuum, 10 years after introduction of Chinese HIV care policies.We included patients from Shandong, China, who were diagnosed with HIV from 1992 to 2013. Records were obtained from the HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Response Information Management System to populate a 7-step HIV care continuum. Pearson \u03c7(2) test and multivariate logistic regression were used for analysis.Of 6500 estimated HIV-infected persons, 60.1% were diagnosed, of whom 41.9% received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Only 59.6% of patients on HAART and 15% of all infected persons achieved viral suppression. Children infected by mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and persons infected by intravenous drug use were less likely to be linked to and retained in care (odds ratio [OR], 0.33 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .14-.80] and OR, 0.58 [95% CI, .40-.90], respectively). Persons tested in custodial institutions were substantially less likely to be on HAART (OR, 0.22 [95% CI, .09-.59]) compared with those tested in medical facilities. Patients on HAART infected by homosexual or heterosexual transmission and those infected by MTCT were less likely to achieve viral suppression (OR, 0.18 [95% CI, .09-.34]; OR, 0.12 [95% CI, .06-.22]; OR, 0.07 [95% CI, .02-.20], respectively).Our report suggests, at the current rate, Shandong Province has to accelerate HIV care efforts to close disparities in HIV care and achieve the 90-90-90 goals equitably.",

The zebrafish model of Mycobacterium marinum infection has provided surprising insights into the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in humans. Similarly, the major principles and phases of cutaneous wound healing are conserved among adult mammals and adult zebrafish. Here, we injected Mycobacterium marinum into the dorsal muscles of adult zebrafish and observed the development of chronic wound pathology. Deep sequencing showed that gene expression related to muscles was down-regulated, whereas expressions of the IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, dram1 genes and the transcript of mir1-2 gene were up-regulated in infected wounds of zebrafish compared with control zebrafish. Muscles are immune-responsive tissues. Thus, muscles may play a role in the anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis immunologic process, which leads to apoptosis of the infected muscle cell and formation of the subcutaneous sinus tract.",

        "abstract": "This study was to evaluate the resistance of antimicrobial agents against pathogens from inpatients with nosocomial infection collected in Beijing, China, during 2011-2014. Measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was carried out using the broth microdilution method with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines as the indicator. A total of 5442 Gram-negative and 806 Gram-positive isolates were collected in this study in 2011-2014. Two carbapenem-resistant strains appeared among Escherichia coli (E. coli), while imipenem-resistant isolates increased in proportion from 0% to 8.2% among Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia) during 4 year. Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) revealed severe antibacterial resistance to most antimicrobial agents. In contrast, a decreasing trend on resistance had been observed among Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) especially after 2012, range from 1.8% for co-trimoxazole to 13.5% for piperacillin. The resistance of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) also had the lowest resistant to linezolid and vancomycin (0.1%). In summary, antimicrobial-resistant nosocomial pathogens have gradually increased from 2011 to 2014, so improved surveillance of hospital-acquired infections and effective infection-control measures may be the best way to solve the present problem.",

        "abstract": "During the development of mammalian cortex, late neurons generated by neuronal progenitors bypass earlier-born neurons and migrate to reach upper layers of cortical plate in an inner-to-outer fashion. Filamentous-actin (F-actin) can regulate neuronal migration, whereas Coactosin-like protein 1 (Cotl1) modulates F-actin. Lys 75 and Arg 73 of Cotl1 play an important role in binding F-actin; when they are mutated to Glu, Cotl1 cannot bind F-actin, called as a non-actin-binding mutant (ABM). The Lys 131 site of Cotl1, the 5-Lipoxygenase (5LO) binding site, is spatially close to Lys 75, leading to impact the binding of Cotl1 to F-actin. When Lys 131 is mutated to Ala (K131A), Cotl1 cannot bind to 5LO. We have demonstrated that overexpression of Cotl1 inhibited neuronal migration and increased the length of neuronal leading processes. To further explore cellular and molecular mechanisms of Cotl1's effect on neuronal migration, we constructed two mutant vectors-Cotl1-ABM and Cotl1-K131A and studied using in utero electroporation and primary neuronal culture technique. Results indicated that in the Cotl1-ABM group, the neuronal migration and length of the leading process both recovered as control neurons at the postnatal day 1 (P1), while in the Cotl1-K131A group, numerous neurons remained in deeper layers of cortical plate or intermediate zone. However, at P7, most Cotl1-K131A transfected neurons reached their destination. Moreover, we found that overexpression of Cotl1 inhibited the proliferation and mitotic activity of NPs. Therefore, These results demonstrated that Cotl1 played an important role in mouse neocortical development.",

After eating the locoweeds, animals develop a chronic neurological disease called \"locoism\". Swainsonine (SW) is the main toxin in locoweeds. Studies have shown that SW induces neuronal apoptosis in vitro and impairs learning and memory in adult mouse. The present study explored effects of SW exposure to dams on the postnatal neurogenesis of DG of offspring. Pregnant ICR mice were orally gavaged with SW at a dose of 0, 5.6 or 8.4\u202fmg/kg/day from gestation day 10 to postnatal day (PND) 21, respectively. We found that SW impaired the proliferation capacity of neural progenitor cells in the DG so that the number of newborn cells was reduced at PND 8. Using the postnatal in vivo electroporation, we showed that the dendritic branching and total length of granule cells were significantly decreased due to SW exposure. In addition, on PND 21, the density of NeuN-positive and Reelin-positive interneurons increased in the hilus, implying the disorder of neuronal migration. These results suggest that maternal exposure to SW, the neurogenesis of DG on offspring was disrupted, finally leading to the functional disorder of DG.",

PSPICE software is used to establish the equivalent circuit model of the single winding and the transient time domain simulation. The MATLAB software is used to analyze the effect of the sampling time. The correctness of the proposed method is verified by simulation analysis. Processing and analysis of the frequency response test data of the winding pulse frequency in the 110kV health transformer, and the correlation coefficient index of the sub critical evaluation, experimental results also shows that the after treatment of short time Fourier algorithm, the frequency response curve of high definition, noise is small, the frequency response curve closer to the actual situation, is better than fast Fourier transform algorithm.",

The Km and Vmax values for lactose were 13.9 \u00b1 1.05 mM and 14.1 \u00b1 0.31 \u03bcmmol glucose released per min per mg protein, respectively. 100 % of lactose in UHT milk was hydrolyzed following separated treatment with 40 mg/L LacLM over 12 h at 10 \u2103, with 5 mg/L LacLM over18 h at 25 \u2103 or with 2.5 mg/L LacLM over10 h at 37 \u2103. The results suggest that the recombinant lactase LacLM can hydrolyze lactose of milk at low temperature or room temperature and can be applied to manufacture lactose-free milk or low-lactose milk.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The physiological capacity of peripheral tissues and organs in clearing brain-derived A\u03b2 and its therapeutic potential for AD remains largely unknown. Here, we measured blood A\u03b2 levels in different locations of the circulation in humans and mice, and used a parabiosis model to investigate the effect of peripheral A\u03b2 catabolism on AD pathogenesis. We found that blood A\u03b2 levels in the inferior/posterior vena cava were lower than that in the superior vena cava in both humans and mice. In addition, injected I labeled A\u03b240 was located mostly in the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and skin but very little in the brain; suggesting that A\u03b2 derived from the brain can be cleared in the periphery. Parabiosis before and after A\u03b2 deposition in the brain significantly reduced brain A\u03b2 burden without alterations in the expression of amyloid precursor protein, A\u03b2 generating and degrading enzymes, A\u03b2 transport receptors, and AD-type pathologies including hyperphosphorylated tau, neuroinflammation, as well as neuronal degeneration and loss in the brains of parabiotic AD mice. Our study revealed that the peripheral system is potent in clearing brain A\u03b2 and preventing AD pathogenesis. The present work suggests that peripheral A\u03b2 clearance is a valid therapeutic approach for AD, and implies that deficits in the A\u03b2 clearance in the periphery might also contribute to AD pathogenesis.",

Besides the different spectral characteristics between bacterial species, THz absorption differences for living bacteria, dead bacteria and bacterial powder of the same species were also investigated. Our results revealed that small differences in water contents between bacterial cells account for distinct discrepancies of the absorption coefficients, which can be used for bacterial species identification. Furthermore, living and dead bacteria showed different absorption coefficients as a result of their different hydration levels, suggesting that THz spectroscopy can be used to rapidly assess the living state of bacteria under test. Our results clearly demonstrated the ability of THz spectroscopy for time-saving and label-free detection of bacteria with minimal sample preparation, potentially to be utilized for point-of-care tests in the near future.

        "abstract": "In this study, we developed a simple colorimetric approach to detect glutathione (GSH). The proposed approach is based on the ability of CuS-PDA-Au composite material to catalytically oxidize 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to ox-TMB to induce a blue color with an absorption peak centered at 652\u00a0nm. However, the introduction of GSH can result in a decrease in oxidized TMB; similarly, it can combine with Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) on the surface of CuS-PDA-Au composite material. Both approaches can result in a fading blue color and a reduction of the absorbance at 652\u00a0nm. Based on this above, we proposed a technique to detect GSH quantitatively and qualitatively through UV-Vis spectroscopy and naked eye, respectively. This approach demonstrates a low detection limit of 0.42\u00a0\u03bcM with a broad detection range of 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910-1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0M with the assistance of UV-Vis spectroscopy. More importantly, this approach is convenient and rapid. This method was successfully applied to GSH detection in human serum and cell lines.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study a novel method was developed for the fluorescent and colorimetric determination of cysteine (Cys). The fluorescent determination was designed based on surface plasmon-enhanced energy transfer (SPEET), and phosphorus/nitrogen co-doped CQDs (PNCQDs) were employed as the donor, of which the fluorescence was quenched by gold nanorods (AuNRs) (acceptor). For the colorimetric assay, under the catalytic effect of Fe 3+ , AuNRs were effectively etched by OH\u00b7 that was generated by the Fenton reaction. The etch of the AuNRs lead to the decrease in the absorbance intensity, the blue shift of longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption peak of AuNRs as well as the fluorescence of PNCQDs recovery. However, Cys can suppress this etching reaction by coordination effect between hydrosulfide group ( SH) in Cys and Fe 3+ , leading to red shift of the LSPR absorption peak. Similarly, the fluorescence will change with the absorbance. The peak shift and the fluorescence change can be applied to monitor of Cys. Under the optimal operation conditions, highly sensitive determination of Cys was achieved, with the fluorescent detection limit of 1.2\u2009nM and the colorimetric detection limit of 0.9\u2009nM. The linearity of the system towards Cys was in the range of 0.005\u201325\u2009\u03bcM. The highly sensitive determination of Cys in urine samples demonstrates that this method possesses high potential for on-site and visual detection of urine Cys.",

It gradually trains features one by one, which is quite different from those conventional machine learning approaches where features are trained in one batch. Preprocessing, such as feature selection, feature ordering and feature extraction, has been verified as useful steps for improving classification performance by previous IAL studies. However, in the previous research, these preprocessing approaches were individually employed and they have not been applied for training simultaneously. Therefore, it is still unknown whether the classification results can be further improved by these different preprocess approaches when they are used at the same time. This study integrates different feature preprocessing steps for IAL, where feature extraction, feature selection and feature ordering are simultaneously employed. Experimental results indicate that such an integrated preprocessing approach is applicable for pattern classification performance improvement. Moreover, statistical significance testing also verified that such an integrated preprocessing approach is more suitable for the datasets with high-dimensional inputs.",

Our study of dimeric NDK5 in a flagellar motility control complex, the radial spoke (RS), has revealed new modalities. The flagella in  mutant were paralyzed, albeit only deficient in three RS subunits. RS morphology appeared severely changed in averaged cryo-electron tomograms, suggesting that NDK5 is crucial for the intact spokehead formation as well as RS structural stability. Intriguingly, 's flagella were also short, resembling those of an allelic spoke-less mutant. All 's phenotypes were rescued by expressions of NDK5 or a mutated NDK5 lacking the canonical kinase activity. Importantly, the mutated NDK5 that appeared fully functional in  cells elicited a dominant-negative effect in wild-type cells, causing paralyzed short flagella with hypophosphorylated, less abundant, but intact RSs, and accumulated hypophosphorylated NDK5 in the cell body. We propose that NDK5 dimer is an RS structural subunit with an additional mechanism that uses cross-talk between the two NDK monomers to accelerate phosphorylation-related assembly of RSs and entire flagella.",

        "abstract": "HSP40s are regarded as co-chaperones perpetually shuttling client polypeptides to HSP70s for refolding. However, many HSP40s central for disparate processes diverge from this paradigm. To elucidate the noncanonical mechanisms, we investigated the HSP40 in the radial spoke (RS) complex in flagella. Disruption of the gene by the MRC1 transposon in Chlamydomonas resulted in jerky flagella. Traditional electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram analysis revealed RSs of various altered morphologies which, unexpectedly, differed in the two RS species. This indicates that HSP40 locks the RS into a functionally rigid conformation, facilitating its interactions with the adjacent central pair apparatus for transducing locally varied mechanical feedback which permits rhythmic beating. Missing HSP40, like missing RSs, could be restored in a tip-to-base direction when HSP40 mutants fused with a HSP40 donor cell. However, without concomitant de novo RS assembly, the repair was exceedingly slow, suggesting HSP40/RS-coupled intraflagellar trafficking and assembly. Biochemical analysis and modeling uncovered spoke HSP40's co-chaperone traits. Taken together, we propose that HSP40 accompanies its client RS precursor when traveling to the flagellar tip. Upon arrival, both refold concertedly to assemble into the mature configuration. HSP40's roles in chaperoning and structural maintenance shed new light on its versatility and flagellar biology.",

UM-BUS is a high-speed, dynamic reconfigurable serial bus with N (\u2264 32) concurrent lanes of mutual redundant structure. It provides the capability of remote memory accessing with maximum communication distance of up to 40 meters. In the case of allowing performance reduction of 50%, any faults in N/2 lanes can be tolerated by reconfiguring the lanes online. Based on the topology of UM-BUS, we introduce a new type of plug and play architecture for embedded systems. It can break the traditional chassis bounds of embedded systems by distributing their in-chassis modules to remote locations. Through an experimental validation system, we demonstrate the feasibility of UM-BUS on real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Loop retiming has been extensively studied to maximize instruction-level parallelism (ILP) of multiple function units by rearranging the dependence delays in a uniform loop. Recently loop retiming technique has been proposed to mitigate the migration overhead of STT-RAM-based hybrid cache by changing the interleaved read and write memory access pattern. However, the previous ILP-aware loop retiming is unaware of its impact on the hybrid cache's migration while the migration-aware loop retiming has not fully considered the parallelism of arithmetic and logical units (ALUs) in VLIW processors.\n\nThis paper models the impacts of loop retiming on both ILP of ALUs and migration overhead in STT-RAM-based hybrid cache. An overall balanced loop retiming solution, considering both of the ALU part and the memory part, is devised to achieve high performance for VLIW processors. The experimental results across a set of benchmarks show that the proposed balanced retiming approach improves performance by 13.1%, 3.5% and 18.1% on average over the cases with no retiming, pure migration-aware retiming and pure ILP-aware retiming, respectively.\n\n",

This review provides the first examination of methodological characteristics and reporting quality of survival analysis in articles published in leading Chinese oncology journals.To examine methodological and reporting quality of survival analysis, to identify some common deficiencies, to desirable precautions in the analysis, and relate advice for authors, readers, and editors.A total of 242 survival analysis articles were included to be evaluated from 1492 articles published in 4 leading Chinese oncology journals in 2013. Articles were evaluated according to 16 established items for proper use and reporting of survival analysis.The application rates of Kaplan-Meier, life table, log-rank test, Breslow test, and Cox proportional hazards model (Cox model) were 91.74%, 3.72%, 78.51%, 0.41%, and 46.28%, respectively, no article used the parametric method for survival analysis. Multivariate Cox model was conducted in 112 articles (46.28%). Follow-up rates were mentioned in 155 articles (64.05%), of which 4 articles were under 80% and the lowest was 75.25%, 55 articles were100%. The report rates of all types of survival endpoint were lower than 10%. Eleven of 100 articles which reported a loss to follow-up had stated how to treat it in the analysis. One hundred thirty articles (53.72%) did not perform multivariate analysis. One hundred thirty-nine articles (57.44%) did not define the survival time. Violations and omissions of methodological guidelines included no mention of pertinent checks for proportional hazard assumption; no report of testing for interactions and collinearity between independent variables; no report of calculation method of sample size. Thirty-six articles (32.74%) reported the methods of independent variable selection. The above defects could make potentially inaccurate, misleading of the reported results, or difficult to interpret.There are gaps in the conduct and reporting of survival analysis in studies published in Chinese oncology journals, severe deficiencies were noted. More endorsement by journals of the report guideline for survival analysis may improve articles quality, and the dissemination of reliable evidence to oncology clinicians. We recommend authors, readers, reviewers, and editors to consider survival analysis more carefully and cooperate more closely with statisticians and epidemiologists.",

A total of 840 piglets were allocated to three dietary treatments consisting of a control group (CG), an alfalfa meal group (AG), and a commodity concentrated fiber group (OG) in a 30-day feeding trial. Gut mucosa and feces samples were used to determine bacterial community diversity by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Fiber treatment had a positive effect on growth performance and metabolism of SCFAs in piglets, in particular, compared with CG, the diarrhea rate was significantly decreased, and the content of propionic acid (PA) in the cecum was markedly increased in AG. The Shannon indices of the jejunum microbiota in AG were higher than CG. At the genus level, compared to CG, in the duodenum, the relative abundance of  in AG and OG was higher; in the jejunum, the relative abundances of , , , , , and  were higher, whereas the relative abundance of  was lower in AG; in the cecum, there was also lower relative abundance of  in AG and OG, and furthermore, the relative abundance of  in OG was higher than in CG and AG. Spearman correlation analysis showed that  was positively correlated with acetic acid, PA, and butyric acid (BA), while  and  were negatively correlated with PA and BA. In addition, microbiota analyses among different intestine segments showed distinct differences in microbiota between the proximal and distal intestines. Bacteria in the proximal segments were mainly , while bacteria in the distal segments were mainly  and . Overall, these findings suggested that DF treatment could reduce the diarrhea rate of piglets and had beneficial effects on gut health, which might be attributed to the alteration in gut microbiota induced by DF and the interaction of the gut microbiota with SCFAs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Recently, miR-146a C>G, miR- 149 T>C, miR-196a2 T>C and miR-499 A>G polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to many diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). However, results have been reported inconsistency in IS, especially in the Chinese population. This study aimed to investigate the polymorphisms of the 4 miRNAs and IS risk in the Chinese population. MATERIAL AND METHODS We used a case-control study to explore these associations in 396 patients with IS and 378 healthy controls. According to TOAST standards, the selected patients were divided into subgroups: the large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) subgroup and the small artery occlusion (SAO) subgroup. The method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to detect the genotypes. RESULTS The miR-146a C>G polymorphism was remarkably different (CC vs. CG+GG: P=0.027; CC+CG vs. GG: P=0.020; C vs. G: P=0.006). The miR-149 T>C polymorphism was also remarkably different (TT vs. TC+CC: P=0.017; TT+TC vs. CC: P=0.020; T vs. C: P=0.004). The miR-146a and miR-149 polymorphisms were also remarkably different in the LAA subgroup (P<0.05). However, we did not find an association of miR-196a2 T>C or miR-499 A>G polymorphisms with IS (P>0.05); we did not find any association in the LAA subgroup or the SAO subgroup (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our study suggested that miR-146a C>G and miR-149 T>C polymorphisms might remarkably increase the risk of IS, which might be mainly associated with an increased risk in LAA stroke; however, the miR-196a2 T>C and miR-499 A>G polymorphisms might not be associated with IS risk in the northern Chinese Han population.",

        "abstract": "Over the years, numerous researchers have explored the relationship between ischemic stroke (IS) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) gene polymorphisms. However, those studies reported conflicting and ambiguous results. The effects of IL-18 (137G/C and 607C/A) genetic variants on IS were investigated in this article. We performed a systematic search that was comprehensively executed in online databases for studies published up to 30 April 2018. Calculation of pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals was applied to assess the intensity of correlation using Stata.12.0. The overall outcome showed that 137G allele increased the risk of IS under the homozygous model (OR=1.36, P=0.027). Nevertheless, on the basis of ethnicity for the subgroup analysis (Asian and Egyptian), it was disclosed that the association was only found in the Egyptian population under the allelic model (OR=2.72, P=0.001) and recessive model (OR=5.04, P=0.000). In the overall analysis, 607C allele increased the risk of IS under all hereditary models (C vs. A: OR=1.26, P=0.002; CC vs. AA: OR=1.67, P=0.002; CA vs. AA: OR=1.30, P=0.001; CC+CA vs. AA: OR=1.41, P=0.000; CC vs. AA+CA: OR=1.48, P=0.000); a similar trend was observed in the Asian population. However, 607C allele was linked to decreased IS risk in the Egyptian population under all genetic models except the heterozygous model (C vs. A: OR=0.48, P=0.006; CC vs. AA: OR=0.19, P=0.007; CA vs. AA: OR=0.47, P=0.078; CC+CA vs. AA: OR=0.39, P=0.020; CC vs. AA+CA:OR=0.30, P=0.030). Although two polymorphisms were associated with IS, the association varied significantly in different countries. Large epidemiological studies will be required to verify these findings in the future.",

        "abstract": "Carotid atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the carotid arterial wall, which is very important in terms of the occurrence of cerebral vascular accidents. Studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes are involved in the formation of atherosclerosis and that atorvastatin might reduce atherosclerotic plaques by regulating the expression of miRNAs. However, the related mechanism is not yet known. In this study, we first investigated the effects of atorvastatin on miR-126 and its target gene, i.e., vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-/-) mice with carotid atherosclerotic plaque in vivo. We compared the expressions of miR-126 and VCAM-1 between the control, atherosclerotic model and atorvastatin treatment groups of ApoE-/- mice using RT-PCR and Western blot. We found the miR-126 expression was significantly down-regulated, and the VCAM-1 expression was significantly up-regulated in the atherosclerotic model group, which accelerated the progression of atherosclerosis in the ApoE-/- mice. These results following atorvastatin treatment indicated that miR-126 expression was significantly up-regulated, VCAM-1 expression was significantly down-regulated and atherosclerotic lesions were reduced. The present results might explain the mechanism by which miR-126 is involved in the formation of atherosclerosis in vivo. Our study first indicated that atorvastatin might exert its anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis by regulating the expressions of miR-126 and VCAM-1 in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Endothelial inflammation characterizes the early stages of atherosclerosis. CXCL16 is a protein that functions as both a chemokine and adhesion molecule, playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, it is uncertain if LPS, a major inducer of inflammation, affects CXCL16 expression in endothelial cells and whether miR-146a, a negative regulator of atherosclerosis, participates in this process. The present study showed that exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to LPS induced the overexpression of CXCL16, TLR4 and NF-\u03baB, and this induction was blocked by the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242. In addition, LPS induced the upregulation of miR-146a in HUVECs. Overexpression or inhibition of miR-146a either inhibited or increased the LPS-induced expression CXCL16, TLR4 and NF-\u03baB protein production, respectively. Additionally, miR-146a-induced CXCL16 expression was blocked by TAK-242. Thus, in this study, we demonstrate that LPS stimulates CXCL16 expression via the TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, and simultaneously, miR-146 negatively regulates LPS-induced CXCL16 expression through a TLR4-dependent mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  Our previous study showed that autophagy flux was impaired with sustained heart ischemia, which exacerbated adverse cardiac remodeling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Here we investigated whether Nobiletin, a citrus polymethoxylated flavonoids, could restore the autophagy flux and improve cardiac prognosis after AMI. AMI was induced by ligating left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery in rats. Nobiletin improved the post-infarct cardiac dysfunction significantly and attenuated adverse cardiac remodeling. Meanwhile, Nobiletin protected H9C2 cells against oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) in\u00a0vitro. The impaired autophagy flux due to ischemia was ameliorated after Nobiletin treatment by testing the autophagy substrate, LC3B\u2161 and P62 protein level both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. GFP-mRFP-LC3 adenovirus transfection also supported that Nobiletin restored the impaired autophagy flux. Specifically, the autophagy flux inhibitor, chloroquine, but not 3\u00a0MA, alleviated Nobiletin-mediated protection against OGD. Notably, Nobiletin does not affect the activation of classical upstream autophagy signaling pathways. However, Nobiletin increased the lysosome acidation which also supported that Nobiletin accelerated autophagy flux.  Taken together, our findings suggested that Nobiletin restored impaired autophagy flux and protected against acute myocardial infarction, suggesting a potential role of autophagy flux in Nobiletin-mediated myocardial protection.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Liver metastasis is a leading cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer. We previously found that colorectal cancer tumor-initiating cells (TICs) expressing CD110, the thrombopoietin (TPO)-binding receptor, mediate liver metastasis. Here, we show that TPO promotes metastasis of CD110+ TICs to the liver by activating lysine degradation. Lysine catabolism generates acetyl-CoA, which is used in p300-dependent LRP6 acetylation. This triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP6, ultimately activating Wnt signaling to promote self-renewal of\u00a0CD110+ TICs. Lysine catabolism also generates glutamate, which modulates the redox status of CD110+ TICs to promote liver colonization and drug resistance. Mechanistically, TPO-mediated induction of c- myc  orchestrates recruitment of chromatin modifiers to regulate metabolic gene expression. Our findings, therefore, establish TPO as a component of the physiological environment critical for metastasis of colorectal cancer to the liver.",

        "abstract": "A rapid method for detection of flumequine (FQ) and oxolinic acid (OA) residues from fish tissues was established using pressurized capillary electrochromatography (pCEC). Residual FQ and OA were extracted from fish tissue samples with acidified acetonitrile and purified on an Oasis HLB C solid-phase extraction column. The extract was then analyzed by pCEC with the mobile phase (pH\u2009=\u20093) consisting of acetonitrile and 15\u00a0mM ammonium acetate (45: 55, v/v, respectively) at the flow rate of 0.07\u00a0mL/min, detection wavelength of 324\u00a0nm, and applied voltage of \u221210\u00a0kV. Baseline separation of FQ and OA was achieved in 10\u00a0min; both drugs showed good linearity in the range of 0.2\u20135\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. The recoveries of FQ and OA were between 82 and 92\u00a0% (relative standard deviation\u2009=\u20093.63\u20135.96). The limits of detection for FQ and OA were 0.1 and 0.08\u00a0mg/kg, respectively.",
