        "abstract": "An SHV beta-lactamase gene was amplified from a beta-lactam resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae K-71 genomic DNA. After expression and purification, we demonstrated that peptide P1 could inhibit the hydrolysis activity of both TEM-1 and SHV beta-lactamase in vitro. Three mutations were introduced into P1 in which the first residue S was replaced by F, the 18th residue V was mutated to Y, and the 15th residue Y was substituted with A, C, G, and R to obtain the mutants of P1-A, P1-C, P1-G, and P1-R, respectively. The mutant peptides were purified and their inhibitory constants against TEM-1 and SHV beta-lactamase were determined. All these beta-lactamase inhibitory peptides could inhibit the activity of both beta-lactamases, while the mutant peptides showed stronger inhibitory activities against TEM-1 beta-lactamase than against SHV beta-lactamase. Inhibition data suggested that P1-A improved the beta-lactamase inhibitory activity by over 3-fold compare to P1. When P1-A was incubated with K. pneumoniae K-71 in Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin, it showed a much stronger growth of inhibition ratio over P1. This study gives us a good candidate for development of novel beta-lactamase inhibitors.",

In this paper, the process of microbial conversion was studied for the production of doxorubicin. A DNA fragment containing C-14 hydroxylase encoding gene doxA, approximate 1.3kb including a ribosome binding site GGAGG was amplified from daunorubicin-producing strain Streptomyces sp. C5. At the same time, the SnpR-activated snpA promoter sequence was also amplified from Streptomyces sp. C5. The recombinant plasmid, pYG908, was constructed for the expression of doxA under the control of snpA promoter, while snpA was regulated by SnpR protein. SDS-PAGE indicated that the engineered strain could apparently express a 46. 6ku band according to the deduced molecular weight of daunorubicin C-14 hydroxylase. DoxA activity was confirmed by CO-binding differential absorbance at 450nm. pYG908 was introduced into Streptomyces lividans TK24 and the resultant engineering strains could convert daunorobicin into a product which has a similar retention time with doxorubicin by HPLC.",

        "abstract": "Objective To establish a tongue carcinoma model in Sprague-Dawley rat and Golden hamster which is similar to the human tongue carcinoma, induced by DMBA and injury for further oral carcinogenesis research. To contrast the pathological expression in the two kinds of models of tongue carcinoma. Methods The left border tongue of the Sprague-Dawley rat and Gold hamster was applied with 1% DMBA acetone solution and chronic mechanical injury locally three times a week for 24 weeks. The pathological appearance was studied by light microscope and transmission electron microscope. Results Different pathological changes including anabrosis, leukoplakia, and intumescence which appeared on the left dorsum border of the tongue were observed in 3rd day after treatment in Sprague-Dawley rat and Golden hamster. The epithelial layer proliferation and basal cell heteromorphism was examined by light microscope and TEM after 8 weeks. We found that the basal cells together with basal membrane invade into lamina propria in Sprague-Dawley rat. At the 16th week, poor differentiation cancer cells and none of horny pearl were detected. The carcinogenesis rate in Sprague-Dawley rat was 76.6% (23 / 30). Leukoplakia and papillary epithelioma, followed by mucosal erosion, was found in Golden hamster after 8 weeks, and exophytic tumor was visible obviously. Hyperplasia of epithelium cells, high differentiation cancer cells and horny pearl were identified. The carcinogenesis rate in Golden hamster was 93.3% (28 / 30). Conclusion Local application both of 1% DMBA acetone solution and chronic mechanical injury on the tongue mucous membrane could induce tongue carcinoma successfully both in Sprague-Dawley rat and Golden hamster. It demonstrated that this is a good technique to establish a well stable , easily duplicated and high ratio of carcinogenesis tongue carcinoma model for the tongue carcinoma research. Furthermore , the carcinogenesis ratio in Golden hamster is higher than that of Sprague-Dawley rat. In general, the tongue carcinoma in Golden hamster was mainly high differentiation carcinoma and that of Sprague-Dawley rat was mainly poor differentiation carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "The process of Guangxi hybrid rice trail conducted in 2006 and 2007 had been reviewed and through the analyzed data,some suggestions for further improvement of Guangxi hybrid rice trail were pointed out by the authors. The two years data of the trail shown that abundance of hybrid combinations were tested and more progresses on quantity, yield and quality of hybrid rice were obtained, but there are still some problems such as resistance to insect and disease , and the integrated traits, which affecting the breakthrough of hybrid rice breeding. So the authors suggested that the genetic bases of new hybrids should be expanded, through strengthening genetic utilization between indica rice and japonica rice, utilization of elite wild rice germplasm and to put resistance breeding of hybrid rice into important position of daily work. And make further improvement on integrated traits and their coordination forward to breeding super high yielding rice hybrids in the future.",

        "abstract": "The byssus is an important adhesive structure by which bivalves robustly adhere to underwater substrates. It is susceptible to carbon dioxide-driven ocean acidification (OA). Previous investigations have documented significant adverse effects of OA on the performance of byssal threads, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, multiple approaches were employed to reveal the underlying mechanisms for the effects of OA on byssus production and mechanical properties in the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata. The results showed that OA altered the abundance and secondary structure of byssal proteins and affected the contents of metal ions in distal threads, which together reduced the byssus diameter and amplified byssus nanocavity, causing reductions in mechanical properties (strength and extensibility). Expression analysis of key foot protein genes further confirmed changes in byssal protein abundance. Moreover, comparative transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of ion transportation- and apoptosis-related categories, up-regulation of apoptosis-related pathways, and down-regulation of the \"extracellular matrix-receptor interaction\" pathway, which may influence foot locomotion physiology, leading to a decrease in byssus production. This study provides mechanistic insight into the effects of OA on pearl oyster byssus, which should broaden our overall understanding of the impacts of OA on marine ecosystem.",

In 2015, our group identified 72 unique SMPs in Pinctada fucata, among which Alveoline-like (Alv) protein was reported to have homologous genes in Pinctada maxima and Pinctada margaritifera. In this study, the full-length cDNA sequence of Alv and the functional analysis of Alv protein during shell formation were explored. The deduced protein (Alv), which has a molecular mass of 24.9\u2009kDa and an isoelectric point of 11.34, was characterized, and the functional analyses was explored in vivo and in vitro. The Alv gene has high expression in mantle and could response to notching damage. The functional inhibition of Alv protein in vivo by injecting recombinant Alv (rAlv) antibodies destroyed prism structure but accelerated nacre growth. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining showed that native Alv exists in the EDTA-insoluble matrix of both prismatic and nacreous layers and has different distribution patterns in the inner or outer prismatic layer. Taken together, the characterization and functional analyses of matrix protein Alv could expand our understanding of basic matrix proteins and their functions during shell formation.",

        "abstract": "Activator protein-1 (AP-1) is an important bZIP transcription factor that regulates a series of physiological processes by specifically activating transcription of several genes, and one of its well-chartered functions in mammals is participating in bone mineralization. We isolated and cloned the complete cDNA of a Jun/AP-1 homolog from Pinctada fucata and called it Pf-AP-1. Pf-AP-1 had a highly conserved bZIP region and phosphorylation sites compared with those from mammals. A tissue distribution analysis showed that Pf-AP-1 was ubiquitously expressed in P. fucata and the mRNA level of Pf-AP-1 is extremely high in mantle. Pf-AP-1 expression was positively associated with multiple biomineral proteins in the mantle. The luciferase reporter assay in a mammalian cell line showed that Pf-AP-1 significantly up-regulates the transcriptional activity of the promoters of KRMP, Pearlin, and Prisilkin39. Inhibiting the activity of Pf-AP-1 depressed the expression of multiple matrix proteins. Pf-AP-1 showed a unique expression pattern during shell regeneration and pearl sac development, which was similar to the pattern observed for biomineral proteins. These results suggest that the Pf-AP-1 AP-1 homolog is an important transcription factor that regulates transcription of several biomineral proteins simultaneously and plays a role in P. fucata biomineralization, particularly during pearl and shell formation.",

        "abstract": "The Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in animal development and in the biomineralization process. At present, although the biomineralization mechanism in pearl oyster (Pinctada fucata) has been extensively studied, there is little research on the Wnt signaling pathway in pearl oyster. To understand the potential role of the Wnt signaling pathway in pearl oyster, we cloned and sequenced three genes from the Wnt signaling pathway in pearl oyster that encode the following proteins: \u03b2-catenin, Dishevelled (Dvl) and T-cell factor (TCF). Genomic structure analysis revealed that Pf-\u03b2-catenin genomic DNA contained 15 exons, Pf-Dvl genomic DNA contained 16 exons, and Pf-TCF genomic DNA contained 7 exons. Their deduced amino acid sequences all showed the highest identity with homologs in Crassostrea gigas. Yeast two-hybrid analysis verified that Pf-\u03b2-catenin interacted with Pf-TCF. These three genes were ubiquitously expressed in seven pearl oyster tissues analyzed with the highest expression in the gill and a certain amount of expression in the mantle, a tissue related to shell formation. After shell notching, the dynamic changes in expression of these three genes showed that they reached a maximum at 4days, indicating their response to shell regeneration. All three genes were constitutively expressed during five developmental stages of the pearl oyster, with high levels at the early embryonic development stage. Taken together, these results suggested that Pf-\u03b2-catenin, Pf-Dvl and Pf-TCF might participate in shell formation and early embryonic and larval development in the pearl oyster. ",

        "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that TGF\u03b2/BMP signaling pathway is most likely involved in shell biomineralization in molluscs, but the function of pathway receptors is poorly studied. Here, we cloned and identified two homologous BMP receptor genes, PfBMPR1B and PfBAMBI, from the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata. Real-time quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization revealed that these genes were expressed in mantle edge and pallial, specifically located at the outer epithelia. Knockdown of PfBMPR1B by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly decreased the expression levels of matrix protein (MP) genes and induced the abnormal ultrastructure of prismatic and nacreous layers. Conversely, knockdown of PfBAMBI significantly increased the expression levels of a portion of MP genes and induced the overgrowth of nacreous layer crystals. In the RNAi and shell notching experiments, MP gene expressions were competitively regulated by PfBMPR1B and PfBAMBI. In addition, the receptor inhibitor LDN193189 reduced the expression levels of MP genes in mantle primary cells and larvae, and induced abnormal D-shaped shell formation during larval development. Collectively, these results clearly show that PfBMPR1B and PfBAMBI are involved in regulating shell biomineralization in P. fucata. Our study therefore provides the direct evidence that BMP receptors participate in mollusc biomineralization.",

        "abstract": "The extensible byssus is produced by the foot of bivalve animals, including the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, and enables them to attach to hard underwater surfaces. However, the mechanism of their extensibility is not well understood. To understand this mechanism, we analyzed the ultrastructure, composition and mechanical properties of the P. fucata byssus using electron microscopy, elemental analysis, proteomics and mechanical testing. In contrast to the microstructures of Mytilus sp. byssus, the P. fucata byssus has an exterior cuticle without granules and an inner core with nanocavities. The removal of Ca2+ by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) treatment expands the nanocavities and reduces the extensibility of the byssus, which is accompanied by a decrease in the \u03b2-sheet conformation of byssal proteins. Through proteomic methods, several proteins with antioxidant and anti-corrosive properties were identified as the main components of the distal byssus regions. Specifically, a protein containing thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), which is highly expressed in the foot, is hypothesized to be responsible for byssus extensibility. Together, our findings demonstrate the importance of inorganic ions and multiple proteins for bivalve byssus extension, which could guide the future design of biomaterials for use in seawater.",

        "abstract": "Biomineralization, including shell formation, is dedicatedly regulated by matrix proteins. PfY2, a matrix protein detected in the ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-soluble fraction from both prismatic layer and nacreous layer, was discovered by our group using microarray. It may play dual roles during biomineralization. However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this research, we studied the function of PfY2 on crystallization in vivo and in vitro, revealing that it might be a negative regulator during shell formation. Notching experiment indicated that PfY2 was involved in shell repairing and regenerating process. Repression of PfY2 gene affected the structure of prismatic and nacreous layer simultaneously, confirming its dual roles in shell formation. Recombinant protein rPfY2 significantly suppressed CaCO precipitation rate, participated in the crystal nucleation process, changed the morphology of crystals and inhibited the transformation of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) to stable calcite or aragonite in vitro. Our results may provide new evidence on the biomineralization inhibition process.",

However, mechanisms for constructing these ordered structures and bottom-up strategies to synthesize nacre-like materials are still lacking. Here, we developed a CaCO3 deposition system in vitro to mimic biomineralization process in vivo. Strikingly, in the presence of extrapallial fluid (EPF) from the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, a multilevel layered nacre-like structure was formed on pearl nucleus. Particularly, aragonite nanocolumns with diameters of 30\u201360 nm aggregated by a parallel pattern and assembled into polygonal tablets in each layer. Moreover, linkers between adjacent laminated layers were observed, resembling mineral bridges in natural nacre. Thus, we found that EPF could induce the mineralization of nacre-like structures on pearl nucleus in vitro, which would be helpful for better understanding the mechanism for assembling layered struct...",

Recently, a new type of calponin has been found in shellfish; the present study aimed to determine if this gene in shellfish functions in bio-mineralization, one of the most important processes in a mollusk's growth. We chose Chlamys farreri, a seashell species with great economic value, as the object of the study and obtained its full-length cDNA to study the function of calponin by gene expression analysis, shell notching experiment and RNA interference assays. Calponin in C. farreri is a basic protein that is highly conserved among mollusk species. Except for high expression in the adductor muscle and foot, which correlated with its function of regulating muscle contraction, the calponin gene was expressed more in the mantle than in other tissues. The expression of the gene was induced by shell notching and an RNA interference assay showed that inhibition of calponin expression caused the growth of irregular mineral crystals on the shell. Further analysis indicated that calponin might function by regulating the expression of other mineralization-related genes. Calponin is a mineralization-related protein in C. farreri that might influence mineral crystal growth by affecting the expressions of other proteins, such as matrix proteins and mineralization-regulating proteins.

        "abstract": "In this study, light microscope, scanning and transmission electron microscope, hematoxylin-eosin and fluorescent staining, and mass spectrometry methods were employed to observe the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) crystal formation, hemocyte release and transportation, and hemocyte distribution at the shell regeneration area and to analyse the proteome of hemocytes in the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata. The results indicated that intracellular CaCO3 crystals were observed in circulating hemocytes in P.\u00a0fucata, implying that there was a suitable microenvironment for crystal formation in the hemocytes. This conclusion was further supported by the proteome analysis, in which various biomineralization-related proteins were detected. The crystal-bearing hemocytes, mainly granulocytes, may be released to extrapallial fluid (EPF) by the secretory cavities distributed on the outer surface of the mantle centre. These granulocytes in the EPF and between the regenerated shells were abundant and free. In the regenerated prismatic layer, the granulocytes were fused into each column and fragmented with the duration of shell maturation, suggesting the direct involvement of hemocytes in shell regeneration. Overall, this study provided evidence that hemocytes participated in CaCO3 crystal formation, transportation and shell regeneration in the pearl oyster. These results are helpful to further understand the exact mechanism of hemocyte-mediated biomineralization in shelled molluscs.",

        "abstract": "Polymorph selection during shell or pearl formation has been an intriguing issue, especially for those species of interest for human consumption. The polymorph switching of calcium carbonate controlled by amorphous calcium carbonate-binding protein (ACCBP), an extrapallial fluid (EPF) protein from the pearl oyster identified by our group in 2007, is investigated in this research. FTIR and TGA analysis suggest that ACCBP decreases the bound water content of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), suggesting that ACCBP may be involved in biogenic anhydrous ACC formation. In vitro crystallization and ACC transformation experiments show that ACCBP induces aragonite formation via an ACC precursor in Mg/Ca = 1 and Mg/Ca = 2 solutions at low temperature. Raman, FTIR, ICP and XPS analyses of the initial-stage ACC nanoparticles in the ACC transformation experiment suggest that this polymorph switching may be controlled by increasing the surface Mg/Ca ratio of the ACC, rather than by regulating the bulk Mg/Ca ratio or the short-range ordered structure. These results suggest that the polymorph selection in nacre or pearl growth may be controlled not only by the nucleating template on the matrix but also by the physicochemical effects of EPF proteins.",

Despite a long history of aquaculture, diseases in P. fucata are not well studied, which limits the development of the pearl industry. We report here a shell disease in P. fucata and a study of the shell repair processes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the nacreous layer gradually recovered from disordered CaCO deposition, accompanied by a polymorphic transition from a calcite-aragonite mixture to an aragonite-dominant composition, as revealed by X-ray diffraction analysis. SEM also showed that numerous microbes were embedded in the abnormal shell layers. Similar indications were induced by a high concentration of microbes injected into the extrapallial space, suggesting the potential pathogenic effect of uncontrolled microbes. Furthermore, hemocytes were found to participate in pathogens resistance and might promote shell repair. These results further our understanding of pathogen-host interactions in pearl oysters and have implications for biotic control in pearl aquaculture.",

The 72 unique SMPs of P. fucata were identified before, among which, PNU9, which is a part of an EDTA-insoluble matrix (EISM) of prism and nacre, got our attention. The expression of PNU9 mRNA concentrated on the outer fold (OF) and mantle pallial (MP) of the mantle, which is an important tissue for biomineralization. The result of a shell notching assay suggested that PNU9 participated in shell damage repairing processes. The injection of dsRNA of PNU9 could lead to the overgrowth of nacreous lamellas but had no significant influence on the prismatic layer. According to the results of the crystallization experiment in vitro, rPNU9 (mbp-PNU9) was able to inhibit crystal growth during aragonite crystallization and influence the morphology of calcite. Whatu0027s more, rPNU9 could inhibit precipitation of calcium carbonate and the amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) transition in the aragonite system. The above results may offer new thoughts on the role of shell matrix proteins in the biomineralization process of the nacreous layer.",

        "abstract": "Bivalve animals such as mussels and pearl oysters secrete proteinaceous byssus from the foot to attach themselves to solid surfaces under seawater. Although the biomolecules of mussel byssus have been extensively studied, how they form insoluble threads underwater from soluble protein precursors and how they produce hierarchical microscale threads from biomolecules remains unclear. Here, using the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata as a model, metal ions rather than pH are found to play critical roles in the solidification process of the byssus. Particularly, Ca2+ can induce self-assembly of the foot proteins and the byssal proteins, resulting in aggregate formation. At a concentration of 10 mM, protein fibers with a diameter of approximately 26 \u03bcm and a length ranging from 50 to 400 \u03bcm were formed. Moreover, the fibers are composed of 60\u201390 nm nanospheres, reminiscent of the ultrastructure sizes of threads. It is proposed that Ca2+ can interact with byssal proteins such as thrombospondin-1 containing protein through phosphorylated serine and/or von Willebrand factor type A domains. This study provides insight into how the byssus forms from the soluble protein molecules into insoluble threads underwater and may inspire further biomaterial design for underwater use.",

However, the function of Fam20C in invertebrate animals especially the role in biomineralization is still unknown. Herein, we cloned the cDNA of fam20C from the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata. It is showed that the expression of fam20C in the mantle edge was much higher than other tissues. In situ hybridization showed that fam20C was expressed mostly in the outer epithelial cells of the middle fold, indicating it may play important roles in the shell formation. Besides, fam20C expression increased greatly in the D-shape stage of pearl oyster development, when the shell was first formed. During the shell repair process, the expression level of fam20C increased 1.5 times at 6\u2009h after shell notching. Knockdown of fam20C in vivo by RNA interference resulted in abnormally stacking of calcium carbonate crystals at the edges of nacre tablets, showing direct evidence that fam20C participates in the shell formation. This study provides an insight into the role of kinase protein in the shell formation in mollusk and broaden our understanding of biomineralization mechanism.",

        "abstract": "The molluscan shell is a fascinating biomineral consisting of a highly organized calcium carbonate composite. Biomineralization is elaborately controlled and involves several macromolecules, especially matrix proteins, but little is known about the regulatory mechanisms. The matrix protein Shematrin-2, expression of which peaks in the mantle tissues and in the shell components of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, has been suggested to be a key participant in biomineralization. Here, we expressed and purified Shematrin-2 from P. fucata and explored its function and transcriptional regulation. An in vitro functional assay revealed that Shematrin-2 binds the calcite, aragonite, and chitin components of the shell, decreases the rate of calcium carbonate deposition, and changes the morphology of the deposited crystal in the calcite crystallization system. Furthermore, we cloned the Shematrin-2 gene promoter, and analysis of its sequence revealed putative binding sites for the transcription factors CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (Pf-C/EBPs) and nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y). Using transient co-transfection and reporter gene assays, we found that cloned and recombinantly expressed Pf-C/EBP-A and Pf-C/EBP-B greatly and dose-dependently up-regulate the promoter activity of the Shematrin-2 gene. Importantly, Pf-C/EBP-A and Pf-C/EBP-B knockdowns decreased Shematrin-2 gene expression and induced changes in the inner-surface structures in prismatic layers that were similar to those of antibody-based Shematrin-2 inhibition.\u00a0 Altogether, our data reveal that the transcription factors Pf-C/EBP-A and Pf-C/EBP-B up-regulate the expression of the matrix protein Shematrin-2 during shell formation in P. fucata, improving our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of molluscan shell development at the molecular level.",

        "abstract": "Molluscan bivalves rapidly repair the damaged shells to prevent further injury. However, it remains unclear how this process is precisely controlled. In this study, we applied scanning electronic microscopy, transmission electronic microscopy and histochemical analysis to examine the detailed shell regeneration process of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata. It was found that the shell damage caused the mantle tissue to retract, which resulted in dislocation of the mantle zones to their correspondingly secreted shell layers. However, the secretory repertoires of the different mantle zones remained unchanged. As a result, the dislocation of the mantle tissue dramatically affected the shell morphology, and the unusual presence of the submarginal zone on the nacreous layers caused de novo precipitation of prismatic layers on the nacreous layers. Real-time PCR revealed that the expression of the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) were significantly upregulated, which was confirmed by the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the newly formed shell. The increased matrix secretion accelerated CaCO3 nucleation thus promoting shell deposition. Taken together, our study revealed the close relationship between the physiological activities of the mantle tissue and the morphological change of the regenerated shells.",

        "abstract": "In bivalves, the mantle tissue secretes organic matrix and inorganic ions into the extrapallial space (EPS) to form the shells. In addition, more and more evidences indicate the participation of hemocytes in shell mineralization, but no direct evidence has been reported that verifies the presence of hemocytes in the EPS, and their exact roles in biomineralization remain uncertain. Here, we identified hemocytes from the EPS of Pinctada fucata. Numerous components involved in cellular and humoral immunity were identified by proteome analysis, together with several proteins involved in calcium metabolism. The hemocytes exerted active phagocytosis and significantly upregulated the expression of immune genes after immune stimulation. A group of granulocytes were found to contain numerous calcium-rich vesicles and crystals, which serve as a calcium pool. During shell regeneration, some genes involved in calcium metabolism are upregulated. Strikingly, most of the shell matrix proteins were absent in the hemocytes, suggesting that they might not be solely responsible for directing the growth of the shell. Taken together, our results provided comprehensive information about the function of hemocytes in immunity and shell formation.",

        "abstract": "Seawater acidification and warming resulting from anthropogenic production of carbon dioxide are increasing threats to marine ecosystems. Previous studies have documented the effects of either seawater acidification or warming on marine calcifiers; however, the combined effects of these stressors are poorly understood. In our study, we examined the interactive effects of elevated carbon dioxide partial pressure ( P CO2) and temperature on biomineralization and amino acid content in an ecologically and economically important mussel, Mytilus edulis . Adult M. edulis were reared at different combinations of P CO2\u00a0(pH\u00a08.1 and 7.8) and temperature (19, 22 and 25\u00b0C) for 2\u2005months. The results indicated that elevated P CO2\u00a0significantly decreased the net calcification rate, the calcium content and the Ca/Mg ratio of the shells, induced the differential expression of biomineralization-related genes, modified shell ultrastructure and altered amino acid content, implying significant effects of seawater acidification on biomineralization and amino acid metabolism. Notably, elevated temperature enhanced the effects of seawater acidification on these parameters. The shell breaking force significantly decreased under elevated P CO2, but the effect was not exacerbated by elevated temperature. The results suggest that the interactive effects of seawater acidification and elevated temperature on mussels are likely to have ecological and functional implications. This study is therefore helpful for better understanding the underlying effects of changing marine environments on mussels and other marine calcifiers.",

However, their distribution patterns in biominerals at the microscale are unclear. Here, we labeled nacre proteins of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata with cyanine 5 and then directly observed their distribution inside the whole synthetic calcite by using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). Compared to traditional microscopy, we found three forms of occlusions in the crystals, i.e., chain-like, islet-like, and haze-like clusters. In addition, in the whole calcite, a two-ring pattern occurred. Based on the images, we studied the crystal growth process in the presence of nacre proteins with an overgrowth experiment. This study provides a novel approach to directly observe the distribution of nacre proteins in the whole calcite, which has implications for understanding the structures and mechanisms of formation of biominerals as well as for...",

        "abstract": "Shells of pearl oysters are natural biominerals with remarkable properties that can be repaired after damage. The repair process can be regulated by biomacromolecules, especially shell matrix proteins (SMPs). Identifying SMPs is critical for further understanding the process. Although proteomic methods have been used to reveal the complex protein mixture in mature shells, the proteomics of repaired shells after shell damage have not been reported before. In the work described here, we studied the SMPs of the repaired shells (prismatic layers) 5\u201320 days after shell damage in the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata by integrating transcriptomics and proteomics and then compared the microstructure difference between repaired and mature shells. Although the repaired shells are calcite, similar to mature shells, the microstructures of repaired shells during the regeneration process were different, which could simulate the embryonic shell formation process. In total, we found 49 SMPs from the repaired shells, includin...",

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence has elucidated that microRNAs (miRNAs) transcribed from miRNA cluster at DLK-DIO3 imprinted domain are involved in various cancers. However, as one member of this cluster, the underlying mechanisms and functions of miR-381-3p in bladder cancer (BCa) still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that the hypermethylated status of upstream maternally expressed gene 3 divergent methylation region reduces the expression of miR-381-3p in BCa by bisulfite-sequencing PCR. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that overexpression of miR-381-3p significantly inhibits cell proliferation via inducing G phase arrest and migration via down-regulating MET and CCNA2 induced EMT progression. CDK6/CCNA2/MET are all identified as the direct targets of miR-381-3p by bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, inhibition of CCNA2 mediated by miR-381-3p as the crucial biregulator not only participates in the proliferation regulation with CDK6 in cell cycle but also modulates the EMT progression via ROCK/AKT/\u03b2-catenin/SNAIL pathway, which establishes an EMT circuit combined with miR-381-3p/MET/AKT/GSK-3\u03b2/SNAIL pathway, and SNAIL is the last confocal target to induce EMT progression. To conclude, we propose 2 novel regulatory circuits mediated by miR-381-3p in BCa, which may assist in the development of more effective therapies against BCa in the future.-Li, J., Ying, Y., Xie, H., Jin, K., Yan, H., Wang, S., Xu, M., Xu, X., Wang, X., Yang, K., Zheng, X., Xie, L.

        "abstract": "Despite the recent studies which have shown that microRNA (miRNA) negatively regulates gene expression by silencing the expression of target genes, here we reported the new evidence of microRNA-mediated gene activation by targeting specific promoter sites. We identified a miR-877-3p binding site on the promoter site of tumor suppressor gene p16 which alters frequently in bladder cancer. Enforced expression of miR-877-3p could increase the expression of p16, which inhibit the proliferation and tumorigenicity of bladder cancer through cell cycle G1-phase arrest. Further evidences confirmed that the correlation between p16 activation and miR-877-3p was due to the direct binding. These findings demonstrate the anti-tumor function of miR-877-3p in bladder cancer cells and reveal a new pattern of miRNA involved gene regulation.",

These procedures are named Xieu0027s Prostate Enucleations (Xieu0027s Procedures for short). Current clinical data indicate that Xieu0027s Procedures are safe and effective treatment options for patients with BPH, especially for patients with larger prostates.

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BCa) is the one of the most common cancers with high incidence, occurrence and low 5-year survival rate. Emerging evidence indicates that DLK1-DIO3 genomic region especially the miRNA cluster in this region is involved in several pathologic processes and various cancers, and miR-323a-3p is a member of this miRNA cluster. In this study, we investigate the function and regulatory network of miR-323a-3p in BCa. miR-323a-3p is frequently downregulated in BCa tissues and three cell lines compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues and bladder normal cell line (SV-HUC-1). Besides, downregulation of miR-323a-3p is significantly associated with poor overall survival rate of BCa. Methylation of DLK1-MEG3 intergenic DMR (IG-DMR) contributes to the reduction of miR-323a-3p. Overexpression of miR-323a-3p significantly inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of BCa. Both upregulated MET and SMAD3 are direct targets of miR-323a-3p, and the knockdown of MET and SMAD3 also represses the EMT progression consistently with overexpression of miR-323a-3p. SNAIL is detected in the last targeted confocal protein of both MET and SMAD3 signaling that trigger EMT consequently. Hence, a miR-323a-3p/MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit is established to regulate the EMT progression of BCa. And a mutual regulatory mechanism between miR-323a-3p/miR-433/miR-409 and MET also participates in this circuit. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a novel regulatory mechanism of the miR-323a-3p/MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit that is involved in the EMT regulation of BCa, which may be a potential therapy target for BCa.",

Fixed- or random-effect models were used to summarize the estimates of relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval for the association between exposure of pesticide and risk of kidney cancer. The pooled RR estimate indicated that pesticide exposure might have an elevated risk for kidney cancer (RR =1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.19). In a subgroup analysis of high quality articles, we detected that pesticide exposure is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer in a subgroup analysis of case-control studies, (Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale score >6) (RR =1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.51). North America studies, odds ratio studies, and studies with effect estimate adjusted for more than two confounder studies. In conclusion, pesticide exposure may be a risk factor for kidney cancer. ",

However, the effect and the mechanisms underlying its action have not been investigated in human bladder cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of ellipticine on the behavior of T\u201124 bladder cancer cells. T\u201124 cells were treated with varying concentrations and durations of ellipticine. Cell viability was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit\u20118 assay. Cell motility was analyzed by Transwell migration assay. Flow cytometry, reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses were performed to detect the cell cycle and signaling pathways involved. The results demonstrated that ellipticine suppressed proliferation and inhibited the migration ability of T\u201124 bladder cancer cells in a dose\u2011 and time\u2011dependent manner, and resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest. The mechanism of this action was demonstrated to be due to ellipticine\u2011triggered activation of the ATM serine/threonine kinase pathway. These data therefore suggest that ellipticine may be effective towards treating human bladder cancer.",

        "abstract": "The downregulation of DIRAS1 has been suggested to potentially contribute to tumor development and progression in several human cancers. However, the role of DIRAS1 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains elusive. In this study, we examined the DIRAS1 expression level in RCC cell lines and tissues. Both RNA activation (RNAa) and vector transfection methods were used to upregulate the expression of DIRAS1 in RCC cells. Expression analysis revealed that DIRAS1 was significantly downregulated in RCC cell lines and tissues compared with nontumorigenic renal cells and adjacent nontumor tissues individually. Promoter methylation analysis indicated that the reduced DIRAS1 expression might be partly mediated by epigenetic modulation. The RNAa-mediated overexpression of DIRAS1 inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. The re-activation of DIRAS1 also promoted apoptosis and suppressed migration and invasion in RCC cells. The ectopic expression of DIRAS1 via an expression vector recapitulated the RNAa results. These results reveal that DIRAS1, functioning as a putative tumor suppressor in RCC cells, could potentially be a therapeutic target and RNAa could be a therapeutic strategy for RCC.",

Methods  A systematic literature search of articles update to February 2015 was conducted via Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, and the references of the retrieved articles. Fixed- or random-effect models were used to summarize the estimates of OR with 95% CIs for the highest versus the lowest exposure of pesticide.    Results  The pooled OR estimates indicated that pesticide exposure was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (OR=1.649, 95% CI 1.223-2.223). In subgroup analysis, we detected pesticide exposure demonstrated as a significant risk factor on bladder cancer in America (OR=1.741, 95% CI 1.270-2.388). Similar results were discovered in both case-control group and cohort group (OR=2.075, 95% CI 1.183-3.638, OR=1.146, 95% CI 1.074-1.223, respectively). No evidence of publication bias was found by Begg\u2019s or Egger\u2019s test (P = 0.210, P = 0.358, respectively).    Conclusion  In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicated that pesticide exposure was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Further researches should be conducted to confirm the findings in our study and better clarify the potential biological mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BCa) is the one of the most common cancers with high incidence, occurrence and low 5-year survival rate. Emerging evidence indicates that DLK1-DIO3 genomic region especially the miRNA cluster in this region is involved in several pathologic processes and various cancers, and miR-323a-3p is a member of this miRNA cluster. In this study, we investigate the function and regulatory network of miR-323a-3p in BCa. miR-323a-3p is frequently downregulated in BCa tissues and three cell lines compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues and bladder normal cell line (SV-HUC-1). Besides, downregulation of miR-323a-3p is significantly associated with poor overall survival rate of BCa. Methylation of DLK1-MEG3 intergenic DMR (IG-DMR) contributes to the reduction of miR-323a-3p. Overexpression of miR-323a-3p significantly inhibits the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of BCa. Both upregulated MET and SMAD3 are direct targets of miR-323a-3p, and the knockdown of MET and SMAD3 also represses the EMT progression consistently with overexpression of miR-323a-3p. SNAIL is detected in the last targeted confocal protein of both MET and SMAD3 signaling that trigger EMT consequently. Hence, a miR-323a-3p/MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit is established to regulate the EMT progression of BCa. And a mutual regulatory mechanism between miR-323a-3p/miR-433/miR-409 and MET also participates in this circuit. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a novel regulatory mechanism of the miR-323a-3p/MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit that is involved in the EMT regulation of BCa, which may be a potential therapy target for BCa.",

        "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that m6A modifications regulate the progressions of several types of tumors. YTHDF2, an m6A reader, has been implicated in the regulation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). miR-493-3p has been defined as tumor suppressor that inhibits the progressions of several types of cancers. However, the functions and mechanisms of YTHDF2 and the indirect m6A regulated role of miR-493-3p in prostate cancer (PCa) remains to be elusive. In this study, immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) were performed to find YTHDF2 was frequently upregulated but miR-493-3p was downregulated in both PCa tissues and cell lines (DU-145 and PC3) which was negatively correlated with each other. Knock down of YTHDF2 significantly elevated m6A levels, and inhibited the cell proliferation and migration of DU-145 and PC3 cell lines. The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed YTHDF2 as the direct target of miR-493-3p. In addition, forced expression of miR-493-3p consistently elevated the m6A levels and inhibited proliferation and migration with the knock down of YTHDF2. In contrast, overexpression of YTHDF2 and inhibition of miR-493-3p conversely reduced m6A levels. Additionally, the rescue experiments revealed that inhibition of miR-493-3p abrogated the suppression of proliferation and migration induced by si-YTHDF2. To conclude, YTHDF2 and miR-493-3p, as two crucial m6A regulators, are involved in the progression of PCa by indirectly modulating m6A levels.

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been validated to play prominent roles in the occurrence and development of bladder cancer (BCa). MiR-22 was previously reported to act as a tumor suppressor or oncomiRNA in various types of cancer. However, its accurate expression, function, and mechanism in BCa remain unclear. Here, we find that miR-22 is frequently downregulated in BCa tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Overexpression of miR-22 significantly inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of BCa cells both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, miR-22 is found to suppress cell proliferation/apoptosis by directly targeting MAPK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, ERK2) and inhibit cell motility by targeting both MAPK1 and Snail. Further statistical analysis shows that low-expression of MAPK1 or Snail is an independent prognostic factor for a better overall survival in patients with BCa (n\u2009=\u2009401). Importantly, we describe an important regenerative feedback loop among vimentin, Slug and MAPK1 in BCa cells. MAPK1-induced Slug expression upregulates vimentin. Vimentin in turn activates MAPK1. By inhibiting Snail and MAPK1/Slug/vimentin feedback loop, miR-22 suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of BCa cells in vitro as well as in vivo. Taken together, this study reveals that miR-22 is critical to the proliferation, apoptosis and EMT progression in BCa cells. Targeting the pathway described here may be a novel approach for inhibiting proliferation and metastasis of BCa.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Objective  Substantial differences exist in the relationship of prostate cancer (PCa) detection rate and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level between Western and Asian populations. Classic Western risk calculators, European Randomized Study for Screening of Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator, and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator, were shown to be not applicable in Asian populations. We aimed to develop and validate a risk calculator for predicting the probability of PCa and high-grade PCa (defined as Gleason Score sum 7 or higher) at initial prostate biopsy in Chinese men.    Materials and methods  Urology outpatients who underwent initial prostate biopsy according to the inclusion criteria were included. The multivariate logistic regression\u2013based Chinese Prostate Cancer Consortium Risk Calculator (CPCC-RC) was constructed with cases from 2 hospitals in Shanghai. Discriminative ability, calibration and decision curve analysis were externally validated in 3 CPCC member hospitals.    Results  Of the 1,835 patients involved, PCa was identified in 338/924 (36.6%) and 294/911 (32.3%) men in the development and validation cohort, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that 5 predictors (age, logPSA, logPV, free PSA ratio, and digital rectal examination) were associated with PCa (Model 1) or high-grade PCa (Model 2), respectively. The area under the curve of Model 1 and Model 2 was 0.801 (95% CI: 0.771\u20130.831) and 0.826 (95% CI: 0.796\u20130.857), respectively. Both models illustrated good calibration and substantial improvement in decision curve analyses than any single predictors at all threshold probabilities. Higher predicting accuracy, better calibration, and greater clinical benefit were achieved by CPCC-RC, compared with European Randomized Study for Screening of Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator in predicting PCa.    Conclusions  CPCC-RC performed well in discrimination and calibration and decision curve analysis in external validation compared with Western risk calculators. CPCC-RC may aid in decision-making of prostate biopsy in Chinese or in other Asian populations with similar genetic and environmental backgrounds.",

Sorafenib is a candidate for investigation as adjuvant therapy. Methods: 69 patients at multiple centers between Nov 2008 and Jul 2010 with locally advanced clear cell RCC at high risk for disease recurrence postoperatively were enrolled. The criteria for high risk were defined according to Leibovich Score (\u22656), which was based on tumor stage, regional lymph node status, tumor size, nuclear grade. The patients received sorafenib 400 mg bid in 4-12 weeks post radical nephrectomy for a total 9 cycles (6weeks/cycle). The primary endpoint was median disease free survival (DFS). Overall survival (OS) and other safety profiles were investigated, and the efficacy of Udderly Smooth Udder Cream in management of hand and foot skin reaction (HFSR) induced by sorafenib was determined by stratification into two groups (consistent usage or only start use the scream since the onset of HFSR).

        "abstract": "303Background: In 2016, we reported the preliminary results of APL-1202, an oral MetAP2 inhibitor, in the first 18 patients enrolled in the phase II trial. The purpose of the present study is to update the results of efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics at steady state and translational studies in 41 patients. Methods: This is an open-label, single-arm phase II trial conducted in 15 hospitals in China. High-risk in recurrence is defined according to EORTC recurrence score and probability tables in EAU 2012 Guidelines on NMIBC. The primary end point is the recurrence-free survival rate at 1 year. Plasma and urine samples at steady state were collected for pharmacokinetic studies, and separate plasma samples were collected for translational studies. Results: From May 2014, a total of 41 patients have been enrolled in this study, including 39 relapsed after intravesical chemotherapies only (chemo-failed subgroup), and 2 after both chemo and BCG treatments (BCG-failed subgroup). All of patients had TaT1 papilla...",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Serenoa repens among patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia [LUTS/BPH]) in China. Methods: We conducted a double blind, placebo-controlled study of 354 patients with LUTS/BPH from 19 institutions, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Serenoa repens. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) into the Serenoa repens extract (320 mg) or placebo groups for 24 weeks. Primary efficacy parameters were changes in International Prostate Symptom Score and peak urinary flow from baseline to each assessment. Secondary efficacy parameters included improvement of storage symptom and voiding symptom scores, prostate volume, urinary frequency, and total prostate-specific antigen level. Other parameters assessed were quality of life score, a four\u2010item male sexual function questionnaire score, and International Index of Erectile Function score across the consecutive double-blind visits. Results: Statistically significant improvement in the peak urinary flow, International Prostate Symptom Score, scores of storage symptoms and voiding symptoms, quality of life score, four\u2010item male sexual function questionnaire score, and International Index of Erectile Function score were observed in the Serenoa repens extract group compared with those in the placebo group (P <.05). Two (1.18%) of 169 patients in the placebo group and 3 (1.89) of 159 patients in the Serenoa repens extract group experienced 1 or more adverse events. Conclusion: The Serenoa repens extract was effective, safe, well-tolerated, and clinically and statistically superior to placebo in the target LUTS/BPH population. \u00a9 2019",

RECORD-4 prospectively assessed everolimus in a purely second-line setting.Patients with clear-cell mRCC were enrolled into one of three cohorts based on first-line therapy with sunitinib, other anti-VEGF agents, or cytokines. Patients were treated with everolimus 10 mg/day until progression (RECIST, v1.0) or intolerance. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) per investigator review. Data cutoff was 1 September 2014, for the primary analysis and 26 June 2015, for the final overall survival (OS) analysis.Enrolled patients (N = 134) previously received sunitinib (n = 58), other anti-VEGF therapy (n = 62; sorafenib, 23; bevacizumab, 16; pazopanib, 13; tivozanib, 5; and axitinib, 3), or cytokines (n = 14). Overall median age was 59 years, and most patients were men (68%) and of favorable/intermediate MSKCC risk (52/37%). Overall median PFS was 7.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7-11.0]; in the cohorts, it was 5.7 months (95% CI 3.7-11.3) with previous sunitinib, 7.8 months (95% CI 5.7-11.0) with other previous anti-VEGF therapy, and 12.9 months [95% CI 2.6-not estimable (NE)] with previous cytokines. Overall, 67% of patients achieved stable disease as their best objective response. At final OS analysis, total median OS was 23.8 months (95% CI 17.0-NE) and, in the cohorts, it was 23.8 months (95% CI 13.7-NE) with previous sunitinib, 17.2 months (95% CI 11.9-NE) with other previous anti-VEGF therapy, and NE (95% CI 15.9-NE) with previous cytokine-based therapy. Overall, 56% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events (regardless of relationship to study drug).These results confirm the PFS benefit of second-line everolimus after first-line sunitinib or other anti-VEGF therapies. The safety profile of everolimus was consistent with previous experience.Everolimus as Second-line Therapy in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RECORD-4), ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01491672.",

Median PFS in cohort 2 was 7.8 mo (95% CI, 5.7-11). This RECORD-4 subanalysis assessed EVE outcomes after individual first-line anti-VEGF agents in cohort 2. Methods: Pts received EVE 10 mg/d until progression of disease (RECIST, v1.0) or intolerance. Primary end point was PFS per investigator review. Data cutoff was Sept 1, 2014. In this analysis, efficacy and safety were analyzed for pts in cohort 2 (n=62) who received sorafenib (Sor, n=23), bevacizumab (Bev, n=16), pazopanib (Paz, n=13), tivozanib (Tiv, n=5), or axitinib (Ax, n=3); missing information for 2 pts. Results: In groups Sor/Bev/Paz/Tiv/Ax, respectively, 96/81/100/80/33% of pts had good/intermediate MSKCC prognosis, 30/94/54/100/100% were white, 70/0/38/0/0% were Asian, and 83/75/77/100/...",

        "abstract": " A Patterns of Care Study (PCS) was performed in the largest regional medical center in Zhejiang Province, China. The hospital information system (HIS) was used to evaluate patient characteristics and changes in initial treatment patterns for prostate cancer and to determine recent predominant trends in treatment plans for prostate cancer (PCa) in China.  Men who were newly diagnosed with localized or locally advanced PCa for 2010-2011 and 2016-2017 were identified in the HIS database. Patient characteristics and temporal trends in initial management were assessed, and differences between groups were evaluated for significance using Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests.  In total, 1792 patients met the study criteria, including 505 and 1287 patients in the 2010-2011 and 2016-2017 samples, respectively. The average age of patients diagnosed in the 2010-2011 PCS survey was 70 years, decreasing to 68 years when the 2016-2017 patients were included (P<0.001). In the 2010-2011 sample, 50.69% of the patients had an initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level \u226520 ng/ml. In contrast, the initial PSA level was 4-19.99 ng/ml for 66.67% of the patients in the 2016-2017 sample (P<0.001). Based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria, the percentages of patients in low- and intermediate-risk groups increased from 33.06% to 54.78%; conversely, the percentages in high-risk, very high-risk, and regional (N1) groups decreased to a certain extent (P<0.001). According to European Association of Urology (EAU) criteria, the percentages of patients in low- and intermediate-risk groups increased from 32.07% to 53.69%, yet the percentage in the high-risk group decreased (P<0.001). The use of radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiation therapy (RT) increased from 48.32% to 76.46% and 5.35% to 16.94%, particularly in high-risk and low-risk groups, respectively, whereas the rates of hormone therapy (HT) and active surveillance and observation (AS&O) decreased from 32.28% to 4.27% and from 16.04% to 2.33%, respectively (P<0.001). A similar pattern was observed when patients were stratified by EAU risk group.  The results of this real-world study in the largest regional medical center in Zhejiang Province, China, indicate that the predominant characteristics of PCa patients and trends in initial management are changing rapidly. We found the following:  a trend toward a decreased age among newly diagnosed patients;  a trend toward lower initial PSA levels;  a downward trend in risk group classification;  a significant increase in the likelihood of receiving RP, particularly in the high-risk group;  an increase in the rate of RP, mostly due to use of the Da Vinci robotic system;  a significant increase in the likelihood of receiving RT, especially in the low-risk group; and  a decrease in HT and AS&O.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation are closely related to cardiovascular diseases. Although hydrogen sulfide (HS) has been shown to have powerful anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, its role in macrophage inflammation was poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HS in the regulation of macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We reported here that HS attenuated hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which led to caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 production in macrophages. Moreover, HS exerted its protective effects by lowering the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Mechanistically, S-sulfhydration of c-Jun by HS enhanced its transcriptional activity on SIRT3 and p62, which contributed to the decrease of mtROS production. S-sulfhydration sites are investigated by site directed mutagenesis. Findings showed that S-sulfhydrated c-Jun exerted its protective influences via a c-Jun Cys269-dependent manner. Moreover, the protective effects of HS were absent in macrophage from SIRT3 knockout mice. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HS attenuates oxidative stress-induced mtROS production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation via S-sulfhydrating c-Jun at cysteine 269 in macrophages.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) has been shown to have powerful antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties that can regulate multiple cardiovascular functions. However, its precise role in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis remains unclear. We report here that H 2 S reduced aortic atherosclerotic plaque formation with reduction in superoxide (O 2  \u2212 ) generation and the adhesion molecules in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced LDLr \u2212/\u2212  mice but not in LDLr \u2212/\u2212 Nrf2 \u2212/\u2212  mice. In vitro, H 2 S inhibited foam cell formation, decreased O 2  \u2212  generation, and increased nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2013related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation and consequently heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression upregulation in high glucose (HG) plus oxidized LDL (ox-LDL)\u2013treated primary peritoneal macrophages from wild-type but not Nrf2 \u2212/\u2212  mice. H 2 S also decreased O 2  \u2212  and adhesion molecule levels and increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1 expression, which were suppressed by Nrf2 knockdown in HG/ox-LDL\u2013treated endothelial cells. H 2 S increased S-sulfhydration of Keap1, induced Nrf2 dissociation from Keap1, enhanced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and inhibited O 2  \u2212  generation, which were abrogated after Keap1 mutated at Cys151, but not Cys273, in endothelial cells. Collectively, H 2 S attenuates diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, which may be related to inhibition of oxidative stress via Keap1 sulfhydrylation at Cys151 to activate Nrf2 signaling. This may provide a novel therapeutic target to prevent atherosclerosis in the context of diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Rationale: H2S is a gasotransmitter that regulates multiple cardiovascular functions. Kruppel-like transcription factor (KLF) exerts diverse functions in the cardiovascular system.Objectives: The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on myocardial hypertrophy.Methods and results: Myocardial samples of 22 patients with left ventricle hypertrophy were collected and underwent histological and molecular biological analysis. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were studied for functional and signaling response to GYY4137, a H2S-releasing compound. Expression of cystathionine -lyase (CSE), a main enzyme for H2S generation in human heart, decreased in human hypertrophic myocardium, while KLF5 expression increased. In SHR treated with GYY4137 for 4 weeks, myocardial hypertrophy was inhibited as evidenced by improvement in cardiac structural parameters, heart mass index, size of cardiac myocytes and expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Levels of oxidative stress and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases were also decreased after H2S treatment. H2S diminished expression of the KLF5 in myocardium of SHR and in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes rendered hypertrophy by angiotensin II (Ang II). H2S also inhibited ANP promoter activity and ANP expression in Ang II-induced neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and these effects were suppressed by KLF5 knockdown. KLF5 promoter activity was increased by Ang II stimulation, and this was reversed by H2S. H2S also decreased activity of specificity protein-1 (SP-1) binding to the KLF5 promoter and attenuated KLF5 nuclear translocation by Ang II stimulation.Conclusion: H2S attenuated myocardial hypertrophy, which might be related to inhibiting oxidative stress and decreasing ANP transcription activity in a KLF5-dependent manner.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of cardiomyopathy from metabolic stress has increased dramatically; however, its molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5 (Erk5) is lost in the hearts of obese/diabetic animal models and that cardiac-specific deletion of Erk5 in mice (Erk5-CKO) leads to dampened cardiac contractility and mitochondrial abnormalities with repressed fuel oxidation and oxidative damage upon high fat diet (HFD). Erk5 regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 co-activator-1\u03b1 (Pgc-1\u03b1) is critical for cardiac mitochondrial functions. More specifically, we show that Gp91phox activation of calpain-1 degrades Erk5 in free fatty acid (FFA)-stressed cardiomyocytes, whereas the prevention of Erk5 loss by blocking Gp91phox or calpain-1 rescues mitochondrial functions. Similarly, adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated restoration of Erk5 expression in Erk5-CKO hearts prevents cardiomyopathy. These findings suggest that maintaining Erk5 integrity has therapeutic potential for treating metabolic stress-induced cardiomyopathy.",

        "abstract": "Protein S-nitrosylation plays an important role in the progression of cardiovascular diseases. eNOS can be S-nitrosylated in endothelial cells, and this modification reversibly attenuates enzyme activity. Under physiological conditions, eNOS directly interacts with \u03b2-catenin. However, whether and how eNOS S-nitrosylation regulates the \u03b2-catenin signal pathway and participates in endothelial dysfunction remains unknown. Here, we show that OxLDL induces the S-nitrosylation of eNOS, which enhances the interaction between eNOS and \u03b2-catenin, transcriptional activity of \u03b2-catenin, cell migration and adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells. In addition, these effects are partially abolished after eNOS is mutated at Cys94 and Cys99, but not Cys441, in endothelial cells. Furthermore, OxLDL increases iNOS expression. The specific iNOS inhibitor 1400\u202fW decreases eNOS S-nitrosylation and the association of eNOS and \u03b2-catenin, thereby blocking the \u03b2-catenin signal pathway to alleviate OxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction. Taken together, OxLDL induces eNOS S-nitrosylation at Cys94 and Cys99 via an iNOS-dependent manner, which may increase \u03b2-catenin activation and trigger endothelial injury. This study describes a novel mechanism of endothelial dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "SummaryAliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, has shown potent ability to attenuate hypertension. Our previous research has found that aliskiren protected against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and enhanced phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in spontaneously hypertensive rats. However, whether the cardioprotective effect of aliskiren against myocardial I/R injury was eNOS-dependent is unknown. In the present study, 12-week-old male eNOS knockout (eNOS\u2212/\u2212) and wild-type C57BL/6J mice (WT) were orally administrated with the dose of 50\u00a0mg/kg per day of aliskiren. After a 4-week treatment, aliskiren decreased blood pressure in eNOS\u2212/\u2212 mice, and reduced renin-angiotension II levels in both eNOS\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice. Aliskiren also improved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), decreased myocardial infarct size, reduced creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in plasma, attenuated dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in myocardium, increased SOD and thioredoxin (Trx) proteins expression in WT mice subjected to 30\u00a0minutes of ischaemia followed by reperfusion for 24\u00a0hours. However, aliskiren failed to restore all of the above indices in eNOS\u2212/\u2212 mice subjected to the same I/R injury. Our study indicated that aliskiren protected against myocardial I/R injury via an eNOS dependent manner.",

        "abstract": "Rationale:  There is a special role for estrogens in preventing and curing cardiovascular disease in women. Soy isoflavone (SI), a soy-derived phytoestrogen, is a group of biologically active plant substances with chemical structures which are similar to that of an endogenous estrogen-estradiol.   Objective:  We ought to elucidate possible mechanism of SI to improve myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury in ovariectomized rats.   Methods and Results:  Female SD rats were underwent bilateral ovariectomy or sham ovariectomy. One week later, rats were randomly divided into several groups and began to feed soy-free chow: sham ovariectomy operation (control group), ovariectomy with MI/R or ovariectomy with sham MI/R. Other ovariectomy rats were given different doses of SI dissolved in 0.5% carboxymethycellulose (CMC-Na) by gavage. Additional ovariectomy rats were administrated with the same volume of CMC-Na by gavage or 50 \u03bcg/kg\u00b7d of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E 2 ) by subcutaneous injection. After four-week treatment, they were exposed to 30 minutes of left coronary artery occlusion followed by 6 or 24 hours of reperfusion. SI treatment decreased body weight, increased estradiol level and uterus weight. Isoflavone administration significantly reduced myocardial infarct size, improved left ventricle function and restored endothelium-dependent relaxation function of thoracic aortas after MI/R in ovariectomized rats. SI also decreased creatine kinase and malonaldehyde in plasma and attenuated oxidative stress in the myocardium. Meanwhile, SI increased phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) / Akt/ endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signal pathway.   Conclusion:  Soy isoflavone protects myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injurys in ovariectomized rats through increasing PI3K/Akt/eNOS signal pathway and decreasing oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), independently of any specific transporters, has a number of biological effects on the cardiovascular system. However, until now, the detailed mechanism of H2S was not clear. Recently, a novel post-translational modification induced by H2S, named S-sulfhydration, has been proposed. S-sulfhydration is the chemical modification of specific cysteine residues of target proteins by H2S. There are several methods for detecting S-sulfhydration, such as the modified biotin switch assay, maleimide assay with fluorescent thiol modifying regents, tag-switch method and mass spectrometry. H2S induces S-sulfhydration on enzymes or receptors (such as p66Shc, phospholamban, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and ATP synthase subunit \u03b1), transcription factors (such as specific protein-1, kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1, NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factor-1), and ion channels (such as voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, transient receptor potential channels and ATP-sensitive K+ channels) in the cardiovascular system. Although significant progress has been achieved in delineating the role of protein S-sulfhydration by H2S in the cardiovascular system, more proteins with detailed cysteine sites of S-sulfhydration as well as physiological function need to be investigated in further studies. This review mainly summarizes the role and possible mechanism of S-sulfhydration in the cardiovascular system. The S-sulfhydrated proteins may be potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention and drug design in the cardiovascular system, which may accelerate the development and application of H2S-related drugs in the future.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of ephedrine intrathecal injection on maternal thermodynamics and spinal nerve block in cesarean section. A total of 107 patients undergoing elective cesarean section under combined spinal epidural anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups: group E: Bupivacaine (6 mg) combined with ephedrine (15 mg) and group C: Bupivacaine (6 mg). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), the incidence of hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, nausea and vomiting were all recorded. The umbilical vein blood gases and noradrenaline, as well as maternal peripheral venous blood were analyzed. The time of high-quality spinal block was also recorded. Postoperatively, 1 day, 2 days bedside follow-up and 7, 21, 35 days telephone follow-up were carried out to determine any neurological deficit maternal performance. SBP and DBP decreased in group C but not in group E at 3 min after spinal anesthesia and 1 min after delivery (P<0.05). From 3 min post-anesthesia to the end of surgery, the HR levels in the C group were significantly higher than those of the E group (P<0.05). The incidence of hypotension, tachycardia, nausea and vomiting and neonate acidosis was low in group E compared with group C (P<0.05). The time of high-quality spinal block in group E was longer than that of group C (P<0.05). After spinal anesthesia, the concentration of noradrenaline from maternal peripheral venous blood was low in group C but high in group E compared with before spinal anesthesia (P<0.05). Ephedrine combined with low-dose bupivacaine intrathecal injection effectively maintained maternal hemodynamics and prolonged the time of sensory spinal block.",

        "abstract": " Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Angiogenesis facilitates the formation of microvascular networks and promotes recovery after stroke. The Shh/Gli signaling pathway is implicated in angiogenesis and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study aimed at investigating the influence of isoflurane (ISO) post-conditioning on brain lesions and angiogenesis after I/R injury.  Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), 1.5 h occlusion and 24 h reperfusion (MCAO/R). The ISO  group (ISO group) received 1 h ISO post-conditioning when reperfusion was initiated. Neurobehavioral tests, TTC staining, HE staining, Nissl staining, TUNEL staining, immunofluorescence (IF), immunohistochemistry (IH) and Western blot were performed to assess the effect of ISO after I/R injury.  ISO post-conditioning resulted in lower infarct volumes and neurologic deficit scores, higher rate of neurons survival, and less damaged and apoptotic cells after cerebral I/R injury in rats. Meanwhile, ISO post-conditioning significantly increased the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD34 in the ischemic penumbra, relative to that in the Sham and I/R groups. However, cyclopamine, the specific inhibitor of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, decreased the expression levels of VEGF and CD34, and counteracted the protective effects of ISO post-conditioning against I/R injury in rats.  ISO post-conditioning enhances angiogenesis  partly via the Shh/Gli signaling pathway. Thus, Shh/Gli may represent new therapeutic targets for aiding recovery from stroke.",

        "abstract": "Isoflurane (ISO) post-conditioning attenuates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the underlying mechanism is incompletely elucidated. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways govern a wide range of mechanisms in the central nervous system. We aimed to investigate the effect of the TGF-\u03b22/Smad3 and sonic hedgehog (Shh)/Glioblastoma (Gli) signaling pathway and their crosstalk in the hippocampus of rats with ISO post-conditioning after cerebral I/R injury. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), 1.5 h occlusion and 24 h reperfusion (MCAO/R). To assess the effect of ISO after I/R injury, various approaches were used, including neurobehavioral tests, TTC staining, HE staining, Nissl staining, TUNEL staining, immunofluorescence (IF), qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) and Western blot. The ISO post-conditioning group (ISO group) received 1 h ISO post-conditioning when reperfusion was initiated, leading to lower infarct volumes and neurologic deficit scores, more surviving neurons, and less damaged and apoptotic neurons. IF staining, qRT-PCR and Western blot showed high expression levels of TGF-\u03b22, Shh and Gli1 in the hippocampal CA1 of the ISO group. Phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3), Patched (Ptch), and Smoothed (Smo) were also increased at protein level in the ISO group, whereas total Smad3 expression did not change in all groups. When TGF-\u03b22 inhibitor, pirfenidone, or Smad3 inhibitor, SIS3 HCl, were administered, the expression levels of p-Smad3 and Gli1 were reduced, and surviving pyramidal neurons decreased. By contrast, the expression levels of TGF-\u03b22 and p-Smad3 did not change significantly after pre-injection of Smo inhibitor cyclopamine, but reduced the expression levels of Shh, Ptch, and Gli1. Moreover, Gli showed the lowest expression levels with pirfenidone combined with cyclopamine. These findings indicate that the TGF-\u03b2 and hedgehog signaling pathways mediate the neuroprotection of ISO post-conditioning after cerebral I/R injury, and crosstalk between two pathways at the Gli1 level.",

        "abstract": "Facile and large-scale preparation of materials with uniform distribution of ultra-fine particles is a challenging work for catalysis, and it is even more difficult that the catalyst is excellent in both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogenation, which are corresponding merge and split procedure of hydrogen, respectively. Here, we report the fabrication of ultra-fine bimetallic PtNi nanoparticles embedded in the carbon nanaosheets by means of insitu self-polymerization and annealing. It is a bifunctional catalyst possessing excellent performance in HER and hydrogenation of pNitrophenol. Remarkably, the low-loading PtNi bimetallic catalyst (PtNi2@CNS-600, 0.074 wt% Pt) exhibited outstanding HER activity with an overpotential as low as 68 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 when platinum loading was only 0.612 \u03bcg Pt/cm2 and Tafel slope of 35.27 mV decade-1 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, which is comparable to those values for the 20% Pt/C catalyst (31 mV decade-1). Meanwhile, it also shows the excellent long-term electrochemical durability for at least 30 h with negligible degradation. In addition, the material with increased loading (mPtNi2@CNS-600, 2.88% Pt) displayed robust catalytic activity for hydrogenation of pNitrophenol in ambient pressure and temperature. The catalytic activity towards the split of hydrogen give a circumstantial evidence that agrees the path of Volmer-Tafel reaction in HER in turn.",

        "abstract": "Objective.  lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), also known as Hemophagocytic Syndrome (HPS), is an increasingly recognized clinical syndrome that is characterized by extreme immune activation. HLH was first described as an inherited immune disorder in pediatrics, but it may also arise in adults as the result of persistent antigen stimulation due to infections, autoimmune disorders or malignancies. Early recognition of HLH and appropriate treatment are critically important. For the pediatric patients, the Histiocyte Society Study Group for HLH has developed the HLH-94 and HLH-2004 treatment protocols, but there is no such guideline or consensus for adult HLH. Although there were increasing amount of clinical studies in adult HLH, the majority of them just described the etiologies and clinical profiles, and failed to analyze the treatment effects on outcomes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more clinical data focusing on treatment in adult HLH patients, in order to clarify optimal therapeutic regimens. Our study retrospectively analyzed the causes, treatment strategies, and relevant outcomes in 104 adult HLH patients in our institution, and with the goal of identifying more appropriate therapeutic strategies for adult HLH patients.Methods. After the approval of our protocol by local institutional Ethics Committee, the medical records of 104 consecutive patients with adult onset HLH in West China Hospital from June 2008 to February 2016 were reviewed.  diagnosis was re-confirmed according to HLH-04 criteria, and demographic data, clinical profiles, treatments and outcomes were collected and analyzed.  latest follow-up visit occurred on 1st July 2016.  different therapeutic effects on prognosis were discussed based on the endpoints which were defined as short-term (30 days) and long-term (last follow-up date) survival rates. Statistical analysis was performed on SAS 9.4 software, and was involved in Log-rank test in univariate analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression model in multivariate analysis.  p values were two-sided and pu003c0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results. All of 104 consecutive patients with adult HLH were enrolled in this study.  male/female ratio was 1.6:1 with the median age of 35 (range 16-77). In etiological classification, 75 cases were lymphoma-associated HLH, 13 cases were infection-associated HLH, 2 cases were with autoimmune disorders, and for the remaining 14 cases, the underlying diseases could not be identified. In treatment analysis, corticosteroids were used in 91 cases (87.5%), the median initiation time was 0 day (range 0-26 days) after HLH diagnosis, the median four-week accumulating dosage was 236.57mg dexamethasone. Etoposide was employed in 55 cases (52.9%), the median initiation time was 3.5 days (range 0-62 days), the median four-week accumulating dosage was 590.00mg. Cyclosporine A (CSA) was used in 42 cases (40.4%), the median initiation time was 2 days (range 0-51 days), the median four-week accumulating dosage was 7100.00mg.  median survival time for all patients was 46 days (1-2529 days). On the 30th day after admission, 27 patients (26.0%) had died, and 77 patients (74.0%) had survived. At the last follow-up visit, 74 patients (71.2%) had died, 17 patients (16.2%) were still alive, and 13 patients had been lost to follow-up. Statistical analysis indicated that patients in etoposide-treated group was associated with superior short-term survival rate, compared with non-etoposide-treated group (p=0.0471), but there was no difference in long-term survival rate between the two groups. CSA-treated group was associated with inferior long-term survival rate (p=0.0214), compared with non-CSA-treated group. In patients with lymphoma-associated HLH, those who received antineoplastic chemotherapy had a higher long-term survival rate than those who did not receive it (HAZARD=0.07, pu003c0.0001).Conclusion. The major underlying diseases of adult onset HLH are malignant lymphomas. Etoposide might only improve the short-term survival, but fail to change the long-term survival. Immunosuppressor CSA seems to be associated with negative effects on long-term survival rate. For patients with lymphoma-associated HLH, antineoplastic chemotherapy might improve the long-term outcome. More clinical prospective studies should be initiated for adult acquired HLH.Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",

        "abstract": "To study the effects and mechanisms of interleukin-8 (IL-8) on the proliferation and autophagy of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSC) under hypoxic condition. In the hypoxia model, we set the non-stimulated hBMSC as the hypoxia control group; the hBMSC stimulated by 100 \u03bcmol/L human IL-8 as the IL-8 group; the hBMSC stimulated by 50 \u03bcmol/L MK2206 (Akt protein inhibitor) and 100\u03bcmol/L IL-8 as the Akt inhibitor group; and the normal cultured hBMSC as the normal control group. The experiments of EdU cell proliferation and TUNEL apoptosis were respectively used to detect the number of positive cells that were labeled by EdU and apoptosis in each group, and Western blotting and ELISA were used respectively to detect the expression of autophagy protein (LC-3), Akt/STAT3 and other proteins in each group. The results indicated that the proliferation and autophagy of hBMSC in IL-8 group was higher than that in hypoxia control group and Akt inhibitor group, and the apoptosis rate in IL-8 group decreased. These results and the high expression of Akt, STAT3 and VEGF protein of IL-8 group show that under the hypoxic condition, IL-8 played a protective role on MSC through the Akt-STAT3 pathway. It had important significance in the protection of MSC against the injury due to ischemia and hypoxia, and promoted the application of MSC in regenerative medicine.",

        "abstract": "C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL-8) promotes cell homing and angiogenesis. However, under hypoxic conditions, the role of CXCL-8 in the homing of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and its effect on the healing of skin ulcers caused by ischemia and hypoxia remain unknown. In the current study, assays measuring cell proliferation,  angiogenesis and cell migration were performed to evaluate alterations in the proliferation, angiogenic capacity and chemotaxis of HUVECs treated with CXCL-8 protein and/or an Akt inhibitor (AZD5363 group) under hypoxic conditions. Changes in the levels of Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total-superoxide dismutase (total-SOD) were also detected by western blotting and ELISA. In addition,  experiments were performed using a skin ulcer model in mice. Ischemic and hypoxic skin ulcers were created on the thighs of C57BL/6J mice, and the effects of CXCL-8 and HUVEC transplantation on the healing capacity of skin ulcers was determined by injecting mice with HUVECs and/or CXCL-8 recombinant protein (CXCL-8, HUVEC and HUVEC + CXCL-8 groups). Vascular endothelial cell homing, changes in vascular density and the expression of VEGF, SOD, EGF and MDA within the ulcer tissue were subsequently measured.  experiments demonstrated that HUVEC proliferation, migration and tube forming capacity were significantly increased by CXCL-8 under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, levels of VEGF, MDA and SOD were significantly higher in the CXCL-8 group, though were significantly decreased by the Akt and STAT3 inhibitors.  experiments demonstrated that the expression of VEGF, total-SOD and EGF proteins were higher in the skin ulcer tissue of mice treated with CXCL-8 + HUVEC, relative to mice treated with HUVECs alone. Furthermore, vascular endothelial cell homing and vascular density were significantly increased in the CXCL-8 + HUVEC group, indicating that combined use of HUVECs and CXCL-8 may promote the healing of ischemic skin ulcers. The present results demonstrate that CXCL-8 may stimulate vascular endothelial cells to secrete VEGF, SOD and other cytokines via the Akt-STAT3 pathway, which in turn serves a key regulatory role in the recruitment of vascular endothelial cells, reduction of hypoxia-related injury and promotion of tissue repair following hypoxic/ischemic injury.",

        "abstract": "Human serum albumin (HSA) has been extensively used in a series of clinical care settings for nearly seven decades. However, the broad application of this protein is seriously limited by its short supply. In this work, the codon sequence of HSA was cloned under the control of the alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (AOX1) and expressed as a secretory protein in Pichia pastoris. A recombinant strain displaying the highest HSA yield was selected by screening for resistance to the highest concentration of antibiotic G418. After optimizing the induction conditions and additional supplements, the highest yield of HSA reached 1.6\u00a0g/L in a shake flask. Performing high density fermentation further improved the highest yield to 8.86\u00a0g/L in a fermenter after 96\u00a0h of methanol induction. This result is more promising than the previous reports of industrial applications, which reported the highest yield as 92.29\u00a0mg/L/h, considering that the space-time yield of rHSA was doubled. In addition, the desired protein was purified by filtration and Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography, which yielded a 58% recovery of a product that had over a 96% purity. This study reveals that Pichia pastoris is an excellent system for recombinant human serum albumin expression due to its outstanding expression capacity. In addition, the high efficiency level of rHSA production lays a solid foundation for its use in industrial production.",

        "abstract": "Thiamine pyrophosphate is an essential coenzyme in all organisms. Its biosynthesis involves independent syntheses of the precursors, pyrimidine and thiazole, which are then coupled. In our previous study with overexpressed and silent mutants of ActhiS (thiazole biosynthesis enzyme from Acremonium chrysogenum), we found that the enzyme level correlated with intracellular thiamine content in A. chrysogenum. However, the exact structure and function of ActhiS remain unclear. In this study, the enzyme-bound ligand was characterized as the ADP adduct of 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole-2-carboxylic acid (ADT) using HPLC and H NMR. The ligand-free ActhiS expressed in M9 minimal medium catalyzed conversion of NAD+ and glycine to ADT in the presence of iron. Furthermore, the C217 residue was identified as the sulfur donor for the thiazole moiety. These observations confirm that ActhiS is a thiazole biosynthesis enzyme in A. chrysogenum, and it serves as a sulfur source for the thiazole moiety.",

An electrochemically reduced nitrogen-doped graphene oxide-modified glassy carbon electrode (ERNGO/GCE) was developed for the determination of carbendazim (CBZ) in food samples. The surface morphology of the modified electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed to demonstrate the large electrode surface and fast electron transfer of the ERNGO/GCE. Electrochemical behaviors of CBZ at different electrodes were studied by voltammetry. Experimental results showed that the ERNGO/GCE achieved better performance for the electrochemical oxidation of CBZ than either the bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) or the nitrogen-doped graphene oxide-modified GCE (NGO/GCE). Under optimized conditions, the ERNGO/GCE exhibited a wide linearity of 5.0~850 \u03bcg/L with a detection limit of 1.0 \u03bcg/L (signal-to-noise ratio = 3). Application of our proposed method in food products was shown to be practical and reliable.",

An Al-MCF modified carbon paste electrode (Al-MCF/CPE) was developed, and both cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed to study the electrochemical properties of the Al-MCF/CPE. The electrochemical behaviors of pentachlorophenol (PCP) at different electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Compared to bare CPE and mesoporous cellular foam (MCF) modified CPE (MCF/CPE), the Al-MCF/CPE showed a stronger enhancement effect on the electrochemical oxidation of PCP. Consequently, the determination of PCP was achieved via a convenient electrochemical method. Under optimal conditions, the oxidation peak current was linearly proportional to PCP concentration in the range of 0.10\u20135.0\u00a0mg\u00a0L \u2212\u00a01 , while the detection limit was 0.080\u00a0mg\u00a0L \u2212\u00a01  (signal-to-noise ratio\u00a0=\u00a03).

A novel method for fabrication of \u03bcPADs is developed in this study using a folded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated paper mask with a specific pattern to form a sandwich structure with inserted chromatographic paper. PDMS penetrates the target paper from the front and the back sides, and then is cured in the target paper to form legible channels. This method for prototyping \u03bcPADs has many favorable merits including simple operation without the need of trained personnel, fast fabrication and low cost. We further investigated colorimetric detection of melamine in the \u03bcPADs, and it showed a remarkable measurement with a detection limit of 0.1\u202fppm in aqueous solutions and liquid milk discriminated by the naked eye, which meets the detection limit required by USA and China. The fabricating strategy developed in this study is very promising and attractive for the development of simple \u03bcPADs for point-of-care applications, including diagnostic testing, food safety control and environmental monitoring.",

Herein, we report a napkin-based wearable capacitive sensor fabricated by a novel, low-cost, and facile strategy. The capacitive sensor is composed of two pieces of electrode plates manufactured by spontaneous assembly of silver nanowires (NWs) on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-patterned napkin. The sensor possesses high sensitivity (>7.492 kPa), low cost, and capability for simultaneous detection of multiple signals. We demonstrate that the capacitive sensor can be applied to identify a variety of human physiological signals, including finger motions, eye blinking, and minute wrist pulse. More interestingly, the capacitive sensor comfortably attached to the temple can simultaneously monitor eye blinking and blood pulse. The demonstrated sensor shows great prospects in the applications of human-machine interface, prosthetics, home-based healthcare, and flexible touch panels.",
