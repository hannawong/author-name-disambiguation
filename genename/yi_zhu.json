The as-prepared samples were well-determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscope (DRS) and low-temperature N 2 adsorption. The results indicated that both hydrothermal temperature and pH value of reaction solution had significant influence on the formation of crystal structures. Hydrothermal temperature of 180\u00b0C and acidic condition facilitated the formation of monoclinic BiVO 4. The pH value of reaction solution also affected the morphologies of samples remarkably, which resulted in three different types: sheet-, cube-and rod-like shapes. All the samples were applied to the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light and sheet-like BiVO 4 obtained in pH=2 reaction solution exhibited the best photocatalytic activity (4 h, 92.0%). In addition, influence factors of this photocatalytic system were thoroughly investigated, which included photocatalyst dosage, initial concentration and the existence of electron acceptors. The optimal photocatalytic condition was as follow: the dosage of catalyst was 1.0 g/L, the initial concentration of methylene blue was 10 mg/L, and KBrO 3 was used as electron acceptor.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the balance capability and postural symmetry in chronic hemiparetic patients with brain injury. Methods Balance and postural symmetry of24 hemiparetic patients and 24 healthy control subjects were assessed by PK 254 P rehabilitation system of standard sitting and standing for 30 s. The variables of anterior-posterior( AP) standard deviation of center of pressure( COP),medial-lateral( ML) standard deviation of COP,average AP speed of COP,average ML speed of COP,perimeter of COP,and ellipse area of COP were used in determining the balance. Also the average position of COP in X axis represented the symmetry of weight distribution in standing. Results In hemiparetic both sitting and standing( AP standard deviation of COP,ML standard deviation of COP,average AP speed of COP,average ML speed of COP,perimeter of COP,and elipse area of COP) were lager than health subjects( P < 0. 05),and the average position of COP in hemiparetic was bigger than control subjects( P < 0. 05). There was moderate correlations( r =0. 44-0. 68) between measures of average position of COP and other six postural stability variables. Conclusions PK 254P balancing feedback apparatus is sensitive to test hemiparetic patients balance in sitting and standing positions. For hemiparetic patients with ambulation capability,there were still trunk control and balance disturbances. These patients with the capability of walking still need balance or postural control training to further improve their daily livings and walking performances. The hemiparetic patients presents asymmetrial weight distribution,and center of mass moved toward the nonparetic side. The more asymmetrical the weight bearing is,the worse the balance.",

        "abstract": "Aiming to solve the problem that the software design of real-time systems is difficult to effectively take into account both functional requirements and non-functional requirements, a support method for resource modeling and analysis of real-time software is proposed. First, a resource communicating sequential process (RCSP) is obtained by extending resource information on a communicating sequential process (CSP), and resource consumption of instructions in real-time systems is mapped into the resource of the RCSP. The resource consumption of real-time software can be modeled and quantitatively analyzed by using the RCSP. Then, resource optimal checking algorithms are proposed to check the resource satisfiability of instructions and calculate the minimum resources of real-time systems. Finally, a traffic alert and collision avoidance system is modeled and analyzed to illustrate the effectiveness of this method. The results show that this method can analyze the key software design elements which influence the resource use of real-time systems, and it can evaluate the effects of optimizing software on the resource use of real-time systems. It can improve the accuracy and efficiency of resource calculations. The calculation results can be used to quantitatively analyze and optimize the resource consumption of real-time systems.",

        "abstract": "Time Petri net is widely used to model real-time systems and to analyze system performance. Conflicts are important behaviors of Petri net and its expansion model. To solve conflicts is a key for analyzing model dynamic behaviors. Now, some conflict checking approaches are provided to check conflicts of some expansion Petri Nets which include stochastic Petri Nets, hybrid Petri net (HPN) and interval speed continuous Petri Nets(ICPN). But these approaches can not be used to check conflicts of time petri nets. Because time constraints are imported, then time Petri net's enabling and triggering semantics are more complex than that of Petri net, and the conflict checking of time Petri net is more difficult than that of Petri net. For accurately calculating time intervals and probabilities of conflicts, delay time intervals of transitions are defined based on time constraints when transitions are durative enabling, and the soundness and completeness of this definition are discussed. An approach is proposed to check resources conflicts of time Petri Nets based on time and resource constraints. The approach availability is verified by an example analysis. The results show that applying the approach to check the resource conflicts of real-time systems based on time Petri net modeling is accurate and feasible.",

In order to obtain more accurate UML-RT models, UML-RT models need to be given formal semantics. In this paper we use LOTOS to describe the requirements specification of real-time systems and propose an approach for generating software architecture models from formal specifications by establishing a mechanism for transforming LOTOS specifications into UML-RT models, the UML-RT models generated by this approach can increase the reliability for designing the software architectures of real-time systems.",

        "abstract": "While the potential benefits of multi-business interaction automation are truly phenomenal, the complexity of business has increased dramatically, and building reliable and secure e-business application systems becomes an important issue. Industry standards for Web service composition, such as BPEL, provide the notion of LRT (Long running transaction) for the execution of business processes in Web service collaborations. Formal verification of BPEL programs and specifications has become a hot topic. However, the notion of LRT described in BPEL is purely local and occurs within a single business process instance. In this work a two-step model checking method, from simply to the complex, is proposed for multi-business process. A preliminary step is to judge business correctness on external logic transition relations amongst businesses with various simple symbolic model checking tools, and then make further checking interaction validation based on internal system behavior in multi-business coordination with model checking verification environment for mobile processes. The typical scenario is illustrated to show how model checking is applied to verify the reliability of multi-business coordination. All of these have important implications for ensuring multi-business process coordination.",

To further satisfy the flexible modelling and the changing price analysis demands of inernetwares, this paper defines a price time colored Petri net (PTCPN) which provides an extension in the changing price information and color information for the time Petri net. This paper redefines the semantic aspect of price time colored Petri net in terms of priced timed transition systems. A cumulate price state class is defined, and its soundness and completeness are discussed. An approach is proposed to formalize internetware polymorphism and internetware control structures based on the price time colored Petri net.

        "abstract": "With the process of non-functional properties research on real-time systems, multi-resource estimation and analysis of real-time systems become a hotspot. Process algebra is a formal method that is fit for analyzing the functional properties of real-time systems, but it cannot analyze the multi-resource properties. Resource timed process algebra (RTPA) proposed in this paper can handle it efficiently by extending multi-resource semantics on timed communicating sequential process (TCSP). The multi-resource consumption of real-time instruction is mapped into the resource vector of RTPA, and then the multi-resource consumption of real-time systems can be modeled and optimized by using RTPA; the resource optimal checking algorithms are proposed to check the multi-resource satisfiability of instructions and calculate the minimum resource and accumulated resource of real-time systems. This formal method improves the accuracy and efficiency of multi-resource calculation, and the calculation results can be further used to quantitatively analyze and optimize the multi-resource consumption of real-time systems.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of Cloud computing, social computing, and Web of Things, an increasing number of requirements of complexity and reliability for modeling Web services composition have emerged too. As more reliable methods are needed to model and verify current complex Web services composition, this paper proposes a method to model and verify Web services composition based on model transformation. First, a modeling and verifying framework based on model transformation is established. Then, Communicating Sequential Process CSP is defined according to the features of Web services composition and the corresponding model checking tool Failure Divergence Refinement FDR is introduced. The transformation approaches between Business Process Execution Language BPEL and CSP are later defined in detail. Lastly, the effect of this method is evaluated by modeling and verifying the Web services composition of a Online Shopping System. The results of the experiments show that this method can greatly increase the reliability of Web services composition. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "CPS is a kind of networked embedded system. Its trustworthiness and cost are impacted by energy consumption. Because software is the main component of CPS, it is influenced by the energy consumption of CPS. So it has become a major challenge for CPS development to design low-power, high trustworthiness CPS software. Existing analysis and evaluation methods have problems such as the experimental high cost and big price. If the trustworthiness problem of software can be found in the design phase, it can effectively reduce the cost and improve development efficiency. So modeling, analyzing and evaluating the software architecture energy consumption of the CPS software architecture design stage can help find the energy consumption design defects. It can effectively improve the trustworthiness of the CPS software and reduce development costs. Against this, first build the CPS software architecture energy consumption based on the energy consumption time Petri nets; then by analyzing the trustworthiness problems of the CPS software influenced by the energy consumption, propose the evaluation method for CPS software based on the energy consumption model; finally, indicate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through an instance.",

Studies on how specific PARK2 mutations are manifested on different genetic backgrounds may benefit prognosis and clinical management. Until now, there have been no reports of PARK2 mutations in a Uyghur family with EOPD.We identified a large Uyghur EOPD family with PARK2 mutations, and analyzed genealogical, clinical, and genetic data from the family.Three of 15 members were diagnosed with EOPD, and two point mutations, c.951G>C (p.G284R) and c.924C>T (p.R275W), were found in six family members. Among the mutation-positive members, the three affected members were compound heterozygote, while the three unaffected members were single heterozygote.This is the first report describing a Uyghur family with PARK2 mutations. The compound heterozygous mutation c.951G>C (p.G284R) and c.924C>T (p.R275W) is the pathogenic factor in this EOPD Uyghur family.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the protective effect of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibition on cerebral ischemic injury of mice, and characterized the role of AMPK inhibition on astrocytes, microglias, and neuroinflammation. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in male Kunming mice, and Compound C was used to inhibit AMPK activity. The neurobehavioral scores, infarct volumes, phosphorylation of AMPK, activation of the glial cells, levels of connexin 43 (Cx43), and related inflammatory mediators were affected by the presence or absence of AMPK inhibitor Compound C. AMPK was activated after cerebral ischemia. AMPK inhibition reduced infarct size and improved neurological outcomes after 24h reperfusion of mice. Furthermore, our study revealed that the mechanisms of neuroprotection of AMPK inhibition may be as follows: (1) inhibiting the excessive activation of astrocyte and microglia cells, (2) stabilizing the expression of protective proteins such as Cx43 in astroglias, and (3) inhibiting the release of microglial pro-inflammatory factors. These results demonstrated that AMPK inhibition attenuated cerebral ischemic injury, at least in part, by glial cell-mediated protective effects in mice.",

Methods: Forty SD rats were randomly divided into sham-operation group, IR group, Xuelian high dose group (53.2 ml/kg), middle dose group (26.6 ml/kg) and low dose group (13.3 ml/ kg). The IR models of rat were established by suture method. Xuelian injection were intraperitoneal injected into the rats of Xuelian high, middle and low dose groups with corresponding dose immediately before IR operation and 2 h after cerebral ischemia. Twenty-four h after reperfusion, the score of neurological function was evaluated; the content of evans blue (EB) in brain tissue was measured, the pathological changes of brain tissue and infarct volume were observed by 2,3,5-triphenytetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining; the number of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 positive cell in hippocampus CA1 section was observed by immunohistochemical staining. Results: Compared with IR group, the score of neurological deficit, EB content, infarct volume and the MMP-9 expression in Xuelian high dose group were significantly decreased (all P <0.05), the pathological change was significantly reduced. Conclusions: Xuelian injection has a brain protective role on IR rats and with dose-dependently. The mechanism may be related to inhibit the expression of MMP-9 in brain tissue.",

        "abstract": "Acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone), a potential neuroprotective agent, has an inhibitory effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory reactions. However, whether acacetin has an effect on inflammatory corpuscle 3 (NLRP3) after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury has not been fully determined. This study used an improved suture method to establish a cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model in C57BL/6 mice. After ischemia with middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 hour, reperfusion with intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg of acacetin (acacetin group) or an equal volume of saline (0.1 mL/10 g, middle cerebral artery occlusion group) was used to investigate the effect of acacetin on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Infarct volume and neurological function scores were determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and the Zea-Longa scoring method. Compared with the middle cerebral artery occlusion group, neurological function scores and cerebral infarction volumes were significantly reduced in the acacetin group. To understand the effect of acacetin on microglia-mediated inflammatory response after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, immunohistochemistry for the microglia marker calcium adapter protein ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) was examined in the hippocampus of ischemic brain tissue. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and interleukin-6 expression in ischemic brain tissue of mice was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of Iba1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 and interleukin-6 was significantly lower in the acacetin group compared with the middle cerebral artery occlusion group. Western blot assay results showed that expression of Toll-like receptor 4, nuclear factor kappa B, NLRP3, procaspase-1, caspase-1, pro-interleukin-1\u03b2, and interleukin-1\u03b2 were significantly lower in the acacetin group compared with the middle cerebral artery occlusion group. Our findings indicate that acacetin has a protective effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, and its mechanism of action is associated with inhibition of microglia-mediated inflammation and the NLRP3 signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In microglia, inducible nitric oxide synthase can induce dopaminergic neurons to promote the intake of paraquat. However, exposure to paraquat can result in specific injury to dopaminergic neurons. The substantia nigra pars compacta in patients has activated microglia, but the role of oxidative stress injuryis unkonwn. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of microglia mediated oxidative stress injury in mouse models of Parkinson\u2019s disease. METHODS: Thirty-six C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into two groups with 18 mice in each: Parkinson\u2019s disease group and control group. The model of Parkinson\u2019s disease was established by intraperitoneal injection of paraquat to mice (10 mg/kg). The control group was given the same dose of normal saline as paraquat. Adult spontaneous motor activity was observed in the two groups. The level of dopamine in the substantia nigra pars compacta was observed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The expressions of tyrosine hydroxylase and mac-1 in the substantia nigra pars compacta were measured by immunohistochemical staining under optical microscope. The spectrophotometry was used to detect the activities of glutathione, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and the content of malondialdehyde in the substantia nigra pars compacta. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Parkinson\u2019s disease group showed a marked hypoactive behavior and the number of microglia as compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the Parkinson\u2019s disease group was decreased, but mac-1 was increased compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The content of dopamine in the substantia nigra pars compacta was lower than that in the control group detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (P < 0.05). The activities of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase were significantly reduced in the Parkinson\u2019s disease group, but the content of malondialdehyde was increased as compared with the control group (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that activated microglia in the substantia nigra pars compacta can strengthen oxidative stress injury and weaken anti-oxidative protection, which may be an important pathogenesis of Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

Methods Data of enrolled patients were collected, ABI detected, intracranial arteriostenosis diagnosed by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Results Sixty-two Uygur patients with posterior circulation infarct were enrolled, including 33 with intracranial arteriostenosis and 29 without, and there was significant difference in incidence of diabetes and hyperlipemia between 2 groups (P<0.01). Group stenosis or group single-arteria stenosis were significantly different from group 3-arteria stenosis in ABI abnormality rate (P<0.05), and there was difference in ABI value (P<0.05). Diabetes and ABI abnormality were risk factors inducing intracranial multivessel disease diabetes: OR=5.331,95% CI(1.055,26.947),P=0.043;ABI abnormalityOR=5.455,95% CI(1.208,24.624),P=0.027. Conclusion ABI is associated with intracranial arteriostenosis. With increase of arteries, ABI decreased gradually. Patients having history of diabetes and ABI abnormality are more often complicated by intracranial artery multi-vessel disease.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To observe the effect of inhibition of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) on shape, function and inflammatory factor of microglia for mice after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and the action mechanism of AMPK inhibition on neuroprotective effects. Methods: One hundred and twenty male Kunming mice were randomly divided into sham group, ischemia-reperfusion group, ischemia-reperfusion therapy group (all n=40). Each mouse in ischemia-reperfusion therapy group was given an intraperitoneal inject of compound C (20 mg/kg) after occlusion. A mode of middle cerebral artery occlusion was made by insertion of a thread through internal carotid artery. After 24 hours of reperfusion, neurological deficit scores, infarct volume and expression of specific marker for microglia of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) were investigated, and the expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (gp91phox), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1 \u03b2) were determined. Results: After cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, neurological deficit scores and infarct volume of ischemia-reperfusion therapy group were significantly reduced compared with ischemia-reperfusion group. Small amount of Iba1 ((5.97\u00b11.26)/HP), iNOS ((6.25\u00b12.02)/HP), gp91phox mRNA (0.010\u00b10.007), TNF-\u03b1 ((249.62\u00b148.37) pg/mg) and IL-1 \u03b2 ((107.41\u00b111.77) pg/mg) expressions were observed in sham group. The expressions of Iba1, iNOS, gp91phox mRNA, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2 in ischemia-reperfusion group increased significantly to (11.36\u00b11.18)/HP (P=0.000), (16.38\u00b12.43)/HP (P=0.000), 0.240\u00b10.067 (P=0.000), (442.92\u00b197.59) pg/mg (P=0.002) and (209.09\u00b124.69) pg/mg (P=0.000) respectively. Compared with ischemia-reperfusion group, the expressions of Iba1, iNOS, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2 in ischemia-reperfusion therapy group decreased significantly to (7.60\u00b11.62)/HP (P=0.000), (9.32\u00b12.20)/HP (P=0.000), (290.60\u00b161.40) pg/mg (P=0.007) and (142.61\u00b120.60) pg/mg (P=0.000) respectively, and the expression of gp91phox mRNA declined to 0.170\u00b10.055 (P=0.052) without statistical significance. Conclusions: Inhibition of AMPK activity has neuroprotective effects. Its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of microglia activation and reduction of expression of iNOS, gp91phox, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2.

Methods Eighty-one patients with acute cerebral infarction were enrolled in Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Based on the fasting blood glucose level, the patients were divided into the increased group (\u22657 mmol/L) and the normal group (<7 mmol/L). Blood pressure, blood lipids, total protein (TP), and albumin (ALB) were detected. The neurological functional defects and short-term prognosis were observed when the fasting blood glucose level was higher than 7 mmol/L. Results The NIHSS scores at admission and discharge in the increased group (10.71 and 8.73) were significantly higher than those in the normal group (7.2 and 4.85), P<0.05. The mortality rate and the incidence of poor prognosis were slightly higher in the increased group than the normal group, with no statistically significant difference. The incidence of malnutrition was significantly higher in the increased group (62.5%) than the normal group (35.1%), P<0.05.

        "abstract": "In this study, tassels of Cave-in-Rock (upland) and Alamo (lowland) were removed at or near tassel emergence to explore its effects on biomass production and quality. Tassel-removed (TR) Cave-in-Rock and Alamo both exhibited a significant (P<0.05) increase in plant heights (not including tassel length), tiller number, and aboveground biomass dry weight (10% and 12%, 30% and 13%, 13% and 18%, respectively by variety) compared to a control (CK) treatment. Notably, total sugar yields of TR Cave-in-Rock and Alamo stems increased significantly (P<0.05 or 0.01) by 19% and 19%, 21% and 14%, 52% and 18%, respectively by variety, compared to those of control switchgrass under 3 treatments by direct enzymatic hydrolysis (DEH), enzymatic hydrolysis after 1% NaOH pretreatment (EHAL) and enzymatic hydrolysis after 1% H2SO4 pretreatment (EHAC). These differences were mainly due to significantly (P<0.05 or 0.01) higher cellulose content, lower cellulose crystallinity indexes (CrI) caused by higher arabinose (Ara) substitution in xylans, and lower S/G ratio in lignin. However, the increases of nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) concentration negatively affects the combustion quality of switchgrass aboveground biomass. This work provides information for increasing biomass production and quality in switchgrass and also facilitates the inhibition of gene dispersal of switchgrass in China.",

With the increasing concentration of the NaCl, the seedling growth was obviously inhibited. The plant height decreased, leaves became smaller, photosynthetic leaf area and net photosynthetic rate reduced, and dry matter accumulation decreased significantly, presenting the general traits of glycophyte. Meanwhile, the seedlings also showed relatively high salt tolerance. After exposed to 200 mmol x L(-1) of NaCl for 30 days, the seedlings still survived, with the green leaf area per plant and net photosynthetic rate being 491.9 cm2 and 0.93 micromol CO2 x m(-2) x s(-1), respectively.

        "abstract": "Trials on sling exercise (SE), commonly performed to manage chronic low back pain (LBP), yield conflicting results. This study aimed to review the effects of SE on chronic LBP.The randomized controlled trials comparing SE with other treatments or no treatment, published up to August 2013, were identified by electronic searches. Primary outcomes were pain, function, and return to work. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated, using a random-effects model.Risk of bias was rated as high in 9 included trials, where some important quality components such as blinding were absent and sample sizes were generally small. We found no clinically relevant differences in pain or function between SE and other forms of exercise, traditional Chinese medical therapy, or in addition to acupuncture. Based on two trials, SE was more effective than thermomagnetic therapy at reducing pain (short-term: WMD -13.90, 95% CI -22.19 to -5.62; long-term: WMD -26.20, 95% CI -31.32 to -21.08) and improving function (short-term: WMD -10.54, 95% CI -14.32 to -6.75; long-term: WMD -25.75, 95% CI -30.79 to -20.71). In one trial we found statistically significant differences between SE and physical agents combined with drug therapy (meloxicam combined with eperisone hydrochloride) but of borderline clinical relevance for pain (short-term: WMD -15.00, 95% CI -19.64 to -10.36) and function (short-term: WMD -10.00; 95% CI -13.70 to -6.30). There was substantial heterogeneity among the two trials comparing SE and thermomagnetic therapy; both these trials and the trial comparing SE with physical agents combined with drug therapy had serious methodological limitations.Based on limited evidence from 2 trials, SE was more effective for LBP than thermomagnetic therapy. Clinically relevant differences in effects between SE and other forms of exercise, physical agents combined with drug therapy, traditional Chinese medical therapy, or in addition to acupuncture could not be found. More high-quality randomized trials on the topic are warranted.",

The rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established by the modified Longa thread occlusion method. The EA group was treated with EA at \"Dazhui\" (GV 14) and \"Baihui\" (GV 20) for 30 minutes. The TFP group was treated with lumbar intrathecal injection of Trinuoperazine (TFP) at a dose of 40 microL/kg, the inhibitor of CaM. The EA + TFP group was treated with EA combined with TFP, and the sham-operation group and the model group without any treatment. The neurology deficit score was evaluated by the Julio's neuroethology score methods in all rats, and the expression of CaM in cerebral hippocampus tissue was detected with immunohistochemical method in different intervention condition.(1) In comparison with the model group of 6.90 +/- 1.66, the neuroethology score in the EA group of 14.50 +/- 1.08, the TFP group of 11.70 +/- 1.06 and the EA + TFP group of 14.30 +/- 1.06 were all significantly increased (all P < 0.01), while those still were all lower than the sham group of 17.60 +/- 0.52 (all P < 0.01), and the EA group was better than the TFP group (P < 0.01). (2) In comparison with the sham group of 0.080 +/- 0.045, the immune positive expression score of CaM protein in hippocampus in the model group of 1.680 +/- 0.268 was sig nificantly increased (P < 0.01). In comparison with the model group, the expression score of CaM protein in the EA group of 0.880 +/- 0.179, the TFP group of 0.720 +/- 0.179 and the EA + TFP group of 0.420 +/- 0.249 were all significantly reduced (all P < 0.01), and the expression score of CaM in the EA + TFP group was lower than that in the TFP group (P < 0.05).EA can reduce the injury of cerebral neurons induced by CIRI in rats and promote the recovery, which may be related to its effect in regulating CaM signaling pathway after the ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

Methods:Rat VSMCs were prepared by primary culture and identified by immunohistochemical staining for \u03b1-actin.Cell uptake of RAPA-PLGA-NPs was observed by using transmission electron microscopy(TEM).The effects of RAPA-PLGA-NPs on the growth and expression of the proteins downstream to mTOR(mammalian target of rapamycin) of VSMCs were determined by MTT assay and Western blot analysis,respectively.Meanwhile,the free rapamycin served as comparison. Results:Rat VSMCs were successfully cultured and identified.TEM results showed significant amount of RAPA-PLGA-NPs uptake into the cytoplasm of VSMCs.The MTT results showed that RAPA-PLGA-NPs(1,10 and 100 ng/mL) inhibited the proliferation of VSMCs in a concentration dependent manner(all P<0.05),and the inhibitory effect of RAPA-PLGA-NPs at 1 ng/mL was similar to that of the free rapamycin at 10 ng/mL(P>0.05).Western blot results showed that RAPA-PLGA-NPs of both concentrations(1 and 10 ng/mL) markedly reduced phosphorylation levels of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 of VSMCs,and both effects were more obvious than that of the free rapamycin(10 ng/mL). Conclusion:RAPA-PLGA-NPs are of enhanced permeability,can be rapidly taken up by cells,and have better biological effects than their free forms.",

Method: Thirty-two hand injury patients after surgery were evaluated with Jebsen hand function test, score of thumb opposition function and range of motion of forearm, wrist and fingers. Bivariate linear correlations and multivariate linear regression were analysed. Result: The thumb opposition function was the main negative influence factor on writing, stacking checkers and picking up small common objects. Thumb TAM was the main negative influence factor for time of turn- ing over cards and picking up large heavy cans. Forearm pronation was the main negative influence factor on picking up large light cans. Conclusion: The main influence factors on hand function were thumb opposition function and thumb TAM. So rehabilitation after surgery has to be focused on the thumb movement and opposition function. Positions with- out injury should be opened in order to sustain thumb movement and opposition function after surgery. Early rehabilitation can alleviate the limits of joint motion.",

        "abstract": "Background: Studies have different views on the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied in stroke patients for improving motor function. Objective: To evaluate the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on rehabilitation of motor function in patients with stroke. Methods: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, ISI Web of science, Medline, EMBASE, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodical, Wanfang Data (from database building to July 2013) for randomized controlled trials concerning repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on improving motor function in patients with stroke. The included studies were evaluated according to the method recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. Meta analysis was performed in qualified literatures. The extracted data were analyzed by RevMan 5.1 software and GRADEprofiler 3.6 software. Results and Conclusion: A total of 23 trials were included (intervention group n=400, control group n=301). Quantitative analysis was conducted in seven studies, and descriptive study was performed in the remaining studies. Meta-analyses analyzed Fugl Meyer Motor Scale and Barthel index. Results showed that Fugl Meyer Motor Scale [SMD =0.48, 95%CI(0.10, 0.86)] and Barthel index [SMD=1.38, 95%CI (0.68, 2.09)] were significantly higher in the intervention group than that in the control group. In accordance with The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, outcome indexes were evaluated, and the two indexes were graded low quality. The current evidence shows that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation appears to enhance motor function and activities of daily living of the patients with stroke. Considering the limitations of the included studies, more multi-central randomized controlled trials with large sample sizes and high qualities are required in future to verify the therapeutic efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on motor function of stroke patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To observe the effects of electro-acupuncture(EA) on coordination of detrusor and external urethra sphincter of complete T10 level spinal cord transection rats, to study the mechanism of EA treating on urination disorder in this injury. Method: Female SD rats were randomized into sham-operation group(n=10), model group(n=9) and EA group (n=9). The rat model of complete T10 level spinal cord transection was established. After modeling press was applied on the rat's lower abdomen every day. EA with continuous wave was administered at \"Guanyuan\" (RN 4) and \"Sanyinjiao\" (SP 6) acupoints for 15min. The treatment was carried 1 time every day, and last for 7d. After treatment course was finished, residual urine volume was measured, and detrusor myoelectric activity (DMA) and external urethra sphincter myoelectric activity (EMA) during urinary storage period (perfusion period) and micturition period were detected. Result: Residual urine volume (RV) of EA group was (2.79\u00b10.59) ml, significantly lower than that of model group with (5.18\u00b10.61)ml, higher than that of sham-operation group with (0.09\u00b10.01)ml, the difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). Detrusor myoelectric activity (DMA) of EA group during urinary storage period (perfusion period) and micturition period were (0.567\u00b10.028)mV and (0.763\u00b10.021)mV, significantly higher than that of model group with (0.372\u00b10.027)mV and (0.458\u00b10.023)mV, Detrusor myoelectric activity (DMA) of sham-operation group during urinary storage period (perfusion period) and micturition period were the highest among the three groups, with (0.672\u00b10.032)mV and (0.900\u00b10.029)mV respectively. Comparison of various indicators among three groups, the differences were statistically significant (P<0.01). External urethra sphincter myoelectric activity (EMA) of EA group during urinary storage period (perfusion period) and micturition period were (0.902\u00b10.016) mV and (0.342\u00b10.022)mV, significantly lower than that of model group with (1.198\u00b10.026)mV and (0.668\u00b10.020)mV, higher than that of sham-operation group with (0.811\u00b10.017)mV and (0.178\u00b10.010)mV. Comparison of various indicators among three groups, the differences were statistically significant (P<0.01). Conclusion: EA could improve the early bladder detrusor lower reflex state of complete T10 level spinal cord transection rats. At the same time, EA could reduce the myoelectric activity amplitude caused by external urethra sphincter abnormal contraction, and reduce the resistance during urination. That could improve coordination between bladder detrusor and external urethra sphincter, reduce the residual urine volume of complete T10 level spinal cord transection rats.",

        "abstract": "MUC4/Y, the transcript variant 4 of MUC4, lacks exon 2 as compared with the transcript variant 1 of MUC4. To date, direct evidence for the function of MU4/Y remains to be reported. Previous studies based their hypotheses regarding the function of MUC4/Y on the characteristic structure domains of this variant. The aim of the present study was to investigate the specific function of MUC4/Y. The pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2 with low MUC4/Y expression was used to establish a stable cell model of MUC4/Y upregulation using a lentivirus vector system. Results showed that MUC4/Y anchored on the cytomembrane and affected cell morphology and cell cycle. Functional analyses indicated that MUC4/Y upregulation slightly potentiated cell proliferation and significantly suppressed apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Further studies revealed that the JNK and AKT signalling pathways were activated. Meanwhile, MUC4/Y upregulation elicited minimal effect on the phosphorylation level of HER2, a membrane partner of MUC4. These results suggest that MUC4/Y promotes tumour progression through its anti-apoptotic and weak mitogenic effect on MIA PaCa-2 cells.",

        "abstract": "Tumor-associated MUC4 mucin has considerable potential as an immunotherapy target for pancreatic cancer. In previous studies, we developed dendritic cell (DC) vaccines which elicited MUC4 antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (MS-CTL) response against tumor cells in vitro. Due to the observation that MS-CTL apoptotic rate increased significantly when co-cultured with MUC4+ tumor cells compared with T2 cells, we investigated whether high expression levels of MUC4 in pancreatic cancer cells would have an effect on the significant increase of apoptosis rate of MS-CTLs. First, the adverse influence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was eliminated by CD8+ T lymphocyte sorting before the induction of MS-CTLs. Then, we constructed clonal MUC4-knockdown HPAC pancreatic cancer sublines with different MUC4 expression for co-incubation system. By utilizing appropriate control to rule out the possible apoptosis-induced pathway of intrinsic activated cell-autonomous death (ACAD) and analogous antigen-dependent apoptosis of CTL (ADAC) in our study system, further analysis of the effect of MUC4 membrane-expression, supernatants and blockade of CTL surface Fas receptor on MS-CTL apoptosis was carried out. The results demonstrated that the level of MUC4 membrane expression strongly positively correlated with MS-CTL apoptosis and the influence of supernatants and Fas-blockade did not significantly correlate with MS-CTL apoptosis. This evidence suggested that there may be a novel counterattack pathway of pancreatic cancer cells, which is a MUC4-mediated, cell contact-dependent and Fas-independent process, to induce CTL apoptosis. Therefore, further exploration and understanding of the potential counterattack mechanisms is beneficial to enhance the efficacy of MUC4 specific tumor vaccines.",

        "abstract": "The period circadian clock 2 (per2) gene plays an important role in modulating the circadian rhythm in the central nervous system. Its protein product, PER2, is mainly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and limbic system, including the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the hippocampus. PER2 rhythmic expression regulates hypothalamus\u2011pituitary\u2011adrenal (HPA) axis excitability and circadian rhythm via integration of optical signals and corticotropin\u2011releasing factor (CRF) stress\u2011related neurotransmitters, resulting in circadian rhythmicity in target organs. Moreover, glucocorticoids and glucocorticoid receptors exert strong negative feedback to the HPA axis and certain regions of the limbic system, modulating rhythmic per2 expression in peripheral organs. To date, the mechanism of action of PER2 in the limbic system and the HPA axis remains unclear, yet the per2 gene is considered valuable in clinical research for the study of metabolic syndromes, functional gastrointestinal disorders and certain liver diseases. In this review, we summarize the biological effects of the per2 gene and its protein product, PER2, in the limbic system, its involvement in regulation of the HPA axis by the limbic system and the resulting effects on the biological rhythm of target organs, and its clinical significance.",

        "abstract": "We selected 106 hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain hospitalized after stroke from three hospitals in Nanjing, China between February 2007 and January 2012. All patients had complete clinical data sets and accounted for 45.5% of the inpatients because of stroke. Results showed that the number of patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain post stroke increased yearly, attacking mainly males 50-69 years of age. Of 106 patients, there were 60 cases (56.6%) of adhesive capsulitis, 19 (17.9%) of shoulder subluxation, 14 (13.2%) of complex regional pain syndrome, and 13 (12.6%) of central pain. The main symptoms were shoulder pain (100%), limit of shoulder mobility (98.1%), and adhesion of the scapula (56.6%). MRI of the shoulder showed tendon and ligament lesions (57.1%) and rotator cuff tear (38.1%). 53.8% of central pain was related to the thalamus, in addition to the basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellopontine angle. Shoulder pain, upper limb motor function, and function independence were significantly improved after comprehensive rehabilitation. In particular, electroacupuncture based on basic physical therapy exhibited efficacy on shoulder tion and complex regional pain syndrome. Multiple linear regression results showed a negative relationship of efficacy of pain management with the attack period of shoulder pain, involvement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and duration between onset and rehabilitation treatment, but a positive correlation with pain-related education, pain regression period, and pain diagnosis.",

However, the role of MUC4 in angiogenesis and the potential association among these malignant capabilities have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the collective signaling mechanisms associated with MUC4-induced growth, metastasis and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer. Knockdown of MUC4 in two pancreatic cancer cell lines led to downregulation of lysosomal degradation of E-cadherin by Src kinase through downregulation of pFAK and pSrc pathway. The downregulation of lysosomal degradation of E-cadherin in turn induced the formation of E-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin complex and membrane translocation of \u03b2-catenin, resulting in the downregulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Thus, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin target genes c-Myc, Cyclin D1, CD44 and VEGF were down-regulated and their malignant functions proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis were reduced. Taken together, MUC4-induced nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin is a novel mechanism for growth, metastasis and angiogenesis of pancreatic cancer.",

        "abstract": "To identify HLA-restricted epitope of mucoprotein 4 (MUC4) antigen as a tumor associated antigen of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and to validate its natural presentation in PDAC patient peripheral blood.Two epitope prediction databases (SYFPEITHI and ProPred-I) were used to predict HLA-A*0201 restricted MUC4 epitope, T2 cell assay was used to determine the peptide binding affinity with HLA-A*0201 molecule. Dendritic cells (DCs) were induced from the HLA-A* 0201-positive healthy individuals' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Mature DCs were pulsed with synthesized peptides. Autologous CD8(+) T cells from the HLA-A* 0201 healthy donor were stimulated with the peptide-pulsed DCs as CTL. CTL activity was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release assay and IFN-\u03b3 released by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Pentamer was synthesized for HLA-A* 0201 restricted epitope P1126, then was used to detect specific CTL in PBMC of PDAC patients.Five candidate HLA-A*0201 epitopes were predicted, LLLGVGTFV (P1125) and LLGVGTFVV (P1126) were determined as the two with more HLA-A*0201 affinity. Mature DCs could be induced from PBMCs. CTL induced by peptide P1126 could lyses T2 cells pulsed with peptide P1126 and HCT-116 cells [MUC4(+), HLA-A2(+)]. The number of CTL induced by peptide P1126 which could secret IFN-\u03b3 (130.3 \u00b1 6.6) was obviously higher than that in the negative group. By Pentamer assay, P1126-pentamer and CD8 double positive CTL could be detected in PBMC of PDAC patients with MUC4(+) than patients with MUC4(-), but no significant difference of CTL frequency between patients with HLA-A2(+) and with HLA-A2(-) in MUC4(+) PDAC patients.Tumor associated antigen MUC4-derived HLA-A* 0201-restrictive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope P1126 can induce CTL reaction. The CTL can secret immunologic active material to induce the specific target cells lysis. P1126 epitope can be naturally presented in PBMC of PDAC patients, but its HLA-restriction may not be perfect.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates an important role of transcription factor Yin Yang-1 (YY1) in human tumorigenesis. However, its function in cancer remains controversial and the relevance of YY1 to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains to be clarified.In this study, we detected YY1 expression in clinical PDAC tissue samples and cell lines using quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blotting. We also detected MUC4 and MMP10 mRNA levels in 108 PDAC samples using qRT-PCR and analyzed the correlations between YY1 and MUC4 or MMP10 expression. The role of YY1 in the proliferation, invasion and metastatic abilities of PDAC cells in vitro was studied by CCK-8 assay, cell migration and invasion assays. In vivo pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis was studied by a xenogenous subcutaneously implant model and a tail vein metastasis model. The potential mechanisms underlying YY1 mediated tumor progression in PDAC were explored by digital gene expression (DGE) sequencing, signal transduction pathways blockage experiments and luciferase assays. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 15.0 software.We found that the expression of YY1 in PDACs was higher compared with their adjacent non-tumorous tissues and normal pancreas tissues. However, PDAC patients with high level overexpression of YY1 had better outcome than those with low level overexpression. YY1 expression levels were statistically negatively correlated with MMP10 expression levels, but not correlated with MUC4 expression levels. YY1 overexpression suppressed, whereas YY1 knockdown enhanced, the proliferation, invasion and metastatic properties of BXPC-3 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. YY1 suppresses invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells by downregulating MMP10 in a MUC4/ErbB2/p38/MEF2C-dependent mechanism.The present study suggested that YY1 plays a negative role, i.e. is a tumor suppressor, in PDAC, and may become a valuable diagnostic and prognostic marker of PDAC.",

        "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells play a key role in non-specific immune response in different cancers, including pancreatic cancer. However the anti-tumor effect of NK cells decreases during pancreatic cancer progression. The regulatory pathways by which NK cells facilitate tumor immune escape are unclear, therefore our purpose was to investigate the roles of the contributory factors.NK cells isolated from fresh healthy peripheral blood were co-cultured with normal human pancreatic ductal cells hTERT-HPNE and human pancreatic cancer cell lines SW1990 and BxPc-3 in vitro. Then NK cell function was determined by Flow cytometric analysis of surface receptors and cytotoxic granules in NK cells, NK cell apoptosis and cytotoxicity, and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cytokines. Expression level of MMP-9, IDO and COX-2 in hTERT-HPNE and SW1990 cells were detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Statistical differences between data groups were determined by independent t-tests using SPSS 19.0 software.Our results showed that NK cell function was significantly downregulated following exposure to pancreatic cancer cells compared to normal pancreatic cells, as demonstrated by lower expressions of activating surface receptors (NKG2D, DNAM-1, NKp30 and NKp46) and cytotoxic granules (Perforin and Granzyme B); decreased secretion of cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3); and reduced cytotoxicity against myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. Further investigations revealed that MMP-9 and IDO may be implicated in SW1990 cell-induced NK cell dysfunction by facilitating tumor immune evasion. Blockade by TIMP-1 and/or 1-MT could partially restore NK function.Taken together, elevation of MMP-9 and IDO induced by pancreatic cancer cells mediates NK cell dysfunction. Our findings could contribute to the development of NK cell-based immunotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.",

        "abstract": "MUC4 plays important roles in the malignant progression of human pancreatic cancer. But the huge length of MUC4 gene fragment restricts its functional and mechanism research. As one of its splice variants, MUC4/Y with coding sequence is most similar to that of the full-length MUC4 (FL-MUC4), together with alternative splicing of the MUC4 transcript has been observed in pancreatic carcinomas but not in normal pancreas. So we speculated that MUC4/Y might be involved in malignant progression similarly to FL-MUC4, and as a research model of MUC4 in pancreatic cancer. The conjecture was confirmed in the present study.MUC4/Y expression was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using gene-specific probe in the clinic samples. The effects of MUC4/Y were observed by serial in vitro and in vivo experiments based on stable over-expressed cell model. The underlying mechanisms were investigated by sequence-based transcriptome analysis and verified by qRT-PCR, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.The detection of clinical samples indicates that MUC4/Y is significantly positive-correlated with tumor invasion and distant metastases. Based on stable forced-expressed pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cell model, functional studies show that MUC4/Y enhances malignant activity in vitro and in vivo, including proliferation under low-nutritional-pressure, resistance to apoptosis, motility, invasiveness, angiogenesis, and distant metastasis. Mechanism studies indicate the novel finding that MUC4/Y triggers malignancy-related positive feedback loops for concomitantly up-regulating the expression of survival factors to resist adverse microenvironment and increasing the expression of an array of cytokines and adhesion molecules to affect the tumor milieu.In light of the enormity of the potential regulatory circuitry in cancer afforded by MUC4 and/or MUC4/Y, repressing MUC4 transcription, inhibiting post-transcriptional regulation, including alternative splicing, or blocking various pathways simultaneously may be helpful for controlling malignant progression. MUC4/Y- expression model is proven to a valuable tool for the further dissection of MUC4-mediated functions and mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Previous evidence indicated that N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) polymorphisms might be a risk factor for several cancers. A number of studies have been conducted on the association between NAT2 polymorphisms and head and neck cancer (HNC) risk. Nevertheless, the results were conflicting. Published meta-analysis on this issue has generated inconclusive results. Thus, we aimed to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship by conducting an updated meta-analysis. Published data prior to August 2013 have been searched and screened. Subgroup analysis on ethnicity, source of controls, sample size, and genotyping method were also performed. As a result, a total of 23 case-control studies including 4,028 cases and 4,872 controls were selected for analysis. Interestingly, the results showed that NAT2 polymorphisms might increase HNC risk for the overall data (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.49). Moreover, in subgroup analyses according to ethnicity, data showed that slow acetylators might increase HNC susceptibility among Asians (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.27-2.49), but not among Caucasians or mixed ethnicities. In conclusion, NAT2 polymorphism might be a low-penetrant risk factor for HNC among Asians.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a ubiquitous class of short RNAs, play vital roles in physiological and biochemical processes in plants by mediating gene silencing at post-transcriptional (PTGS) level. Tomato is a model system to study molecular basis of fleshy fruit ripening and senescence, ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction owing to its genetic and molecular tractability. To study the functions of miRNAs in tomato fruit ripening and senescence, and their possible roles in ethylene response, the next generation sequencing method was employed to identify miRNAs in tomato fruit. Bioinformatics and molecular biology approaches were combined to profile the miRNAs expression patterns at three different fruit ripening stages and by exogenous ethylene treatment.In addition to 7 novel miRNA families, 103 conserved miRNAs belonging to 24 families and 10 non-conserved miRNAs matching 9 families were identified in our libraries. The targets of many these miRNAs were predicted to be transcriptional factors. Other targets are known to play roles in the regulation of metabolic processes. Interestingly, some targets were predicted to be involved in fruit ripening and softening, such as Pectate Lyase, beta-galactosidase, while a few others were predicted to be involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway, such as ACS, EIN2 and CTR1. The expression patterns of a number of such miRNAs at three ripening stages were confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR, which showed a strong negative correlation with that of their targets. The regulation of exogenous ethylene on miRNAs expression profiles were analyzed simultaneously, and 3 down-regulated, 5 up-regulated miRNAs were found in this study.A combination of high throughput sequencing and molecular biology approaches was used to explore the involvement of miRNAs during fruit ripening. Several miRNAs showed differential expression profiles during fruit ripening, and a number of miRNAs were influenced by ethylene treatment. The results suggest the importance of miRNAs in fruit ripening and ethylene response.",

The current limitation in the investigation of genomic function in eggplant is the lack of effective tools available for conducting functional assays. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has played a critical role in the functional genetic analyses. In this paper, TRV-mediated VIGS was successfully elicited in eggplant. We first cloned the CDS sequence of PDS (PHYTOENE DESATURASE) in eggplant and then silenced the PDS gene. Photo-bleaching was shown on the newly-developed leaves four weeks after agroinoculation, indicating that VIGS can be used to silence genes in eggplant. To further illustrate the reliability of VIGS in eggplant, we selected Chl H, Su and CLA1 as reporters to elicit VIGS using the high-pressure spray method. Suppression of Chl H and Su led to yellow leaves, while the depletion of CLA1 resulted in albino. In conclusion, four genes, PDS, Chl H, Su (Sulfur), CLA1, were down-regulated significantly by VIGS, indicating that the VIGS system can be successfully applied in eggplant and is a reliable tool for the study of gene function.",

Method:Screening of irregular red cell blood group antibodies were detected by the micro-column gel anti-globulin technique, the Rh blood group antibodies were identified using monoclonal anti-D, anti-C, anti-c, anti-E, anti-e and red cell Rh blood group antigen, to confirm the accuracy of antibody. Antibody titers, Ig types and 37 \u2103 reactivity test were assayed to clarify its clinical significance.Result:A total of 238 thalassemia children cases were detected. Rh blood group antibodies were positive in 11 cases, which detection rate was 4.6%. The specificity of antibodies were 6 cases of anti-E (54.5%), 3 of anti-D (27.3% ), 1 of anti-cE (9.1%), 1 of anti-C (9.1%), and 11 cases of Rh blood group antibodies of IgG or IgG + IgM class, which antibody titers were between 16 and 128.Conclusion:The detection rate of Rh blood group antibodies in thalassemia children was higher than that of general population. In the positive cases of the Rh blood group antibodies, anti-E accounted for an absolute majority, and the production of antibodies was positively correlated with the number of blood transfusion.",

In comparison with other therapeutic options, intravenous injection of OPLMBs followed by ultrasound mediation yielded a superior therapeutic outcome. Immunohistochemical analyses of the dissected tumor tissue confirmed the increased tumor apoptosis and the reduced VEGF expression after treatment. Western Blot tests further confirmed the decreased expressions of HIF-1\u03b1 and P-gp. Our experiment suggests that ultrasound mediation of OPLMBs may provide a promising drug delivery strategy for the combination treatment of ovarian cancer.",

Perfluoropentane (PFP) has the ability to carry oxygen and to enhance ultrasound or photoacoustic imaging after vaporization. Herein, we constructed a kind of nanoparticles (PTX/ICG and oxygen loaded PLGA nanoparticles (PIO_NPs)), which had PFP core carrying oxygen and PLGA shell loaded indocyanine green (ICG) and paclitaxel (PTX). PIO_NPs harbored good optical stability and the ability to transit phase. Moreover, it could rapidly release PTX and generate ROS under the mediation by near-infrared laser and low-intensity ultrasound. The PIO_NPs enhanced contrast of the ultrasound and PA imaging. In particular, PIO_NPs may be used to monitor and guide treatment for the accumulation of PIO_NPs at tumor site can be observed by PA imaging. Compared with PTX or other nanoparticles, PIO_NPs combined with laser and ultrasound (L.U) significantly induced apoptosis of SKOV3 cells and inhibited SKOV3 tumor growth. Therefore, PIO_NPs are of great potential in cancer imaging and therapy.",

We have successfully synthesized multifunctional folate-targeted and oxygen/paclitaxel loaded microbubbles (TOPLMBs) for ultrasound (US) mediated delivery for combination therapy in an intraperitoneal ovarian cancer xenograft model. The TOPLMBs target both ovarian cancer cells and TAMs and provide a promising drug delivery strategy for the combination treatment of ovarian cancer and tumor microenvironment. Microscopic imaging and flow cytometric analysis showed that TOPLMBs significantly penetrated into ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within tumor ascites fluid and the tumor nodules. Immunohistochemical analyses of dissected tumor tissue confirmed the increased tumor apoptosis, the reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvascular density (MVD), and the reduced expression of CD68 after treatment ( P",

Methods Fifty-four (male:36,female:18) hospitalized patients with coronary artery disease were enrolled in this study. The average age of the patients was 68.47\u00b19.35 years old (52\uff5e84 years old). All the patients underwent sixteen-slice spiral computed tomography for calculating the coronary calcification score (CCS). The calcification scores of the total coronary artery and of each of the sixteen coronary artery segments were compared with the severity of the extend of the stenosis of the related coronary artery. We also analyzed relationship of total CCS with the age of our patients. Results Total CCS had a positive relationship with age (r=0.372,P=0.009) and the severity of the stenosis of some segments of the coronary arteries (RA: r =0.499,P<0.01; LAD: r =0.431,P<0.01; D1: r =0.440,P<0.01; LCX: r =0.469,P<0.01). The CCS of RA,LM and LCX correlated positively with the stenosis severity respectively. Conclusions Total CCS had a positive relationship with age,suggesting the incidence of coronary artery calcification increase with age. CCS correlated positively with the severity of the stenosis of only some of the coronary arteries and these stenosis are all at the proximal segments of the three main branches.",

Methods Reviewing investigation was used for this research.Children below 7 years old were divided into 0 to 8 months group,and 9 to 7 years old as another group. Case control study was carried out for seeking risk factors,such as nosocomial infections,contact with measles cases,vaccination of their mothers and population mobility,so as to determine the causes of prevalence. Results Nosocomial infection and contact with measles cases were the risk factors which made this disease spread,the 95%CI of OR values were 1.6-13,1.03-12.4, respectively. Being infected or vaccination of mothers is a protective factor, and the 95%CI of OR values were 0.02-0.43 and 0.05-0.77, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that nosocomial exposure to measles virus was strong risk factor (OR=10, 95% CI=1.52-83.66).Conclusion Nosocomial infection and contact with measles cases were the risk factors,vaccination of mothers and mothers with measles history were the protective factors,which indicate that the time of measles vaccination should be ahead of schedule.",

        "abstract": "Objective To comprehensively investigate the current status of disinfection work and the disinfection quality among all medical institutions in Baoan District,so as to improve the weak link in disinfection and isolation work,to increase the medical professionals' disinfection and sterilization level,and to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection.Methods Field investigation and sampling examination methods were used to carry out a survey of disinfection quality among 693 medical institutions in Baoan District in 2011.Results The qualified rate of disinfection in the surveyed medical institutions was 96.45%.The qualified rates for public hospitals,private hospitals,community health care centers,private clinics and out-patient clinics were 98.02%,97.57%,97.49% and 95.81%,respectively.There were statistically significant differences in the qualified rates of disinfection among medical institutions at different levels(\u03c72=24.291,P<0.01).The qualified rates of in-use disinfectants and 5 other kinds of detected samples were all above 95.0%,while those of treated sewage,intensity of ultraviolet lamp,and indoor air were all less than 95.0%.Conclusions The qualified rates of treated sewage and intensity of ultraviolet lamp in private hospitals are lower,which may be the potential risk factors for nosocomial infection in medical institutions.The qualified rates of disinfection quality in private clinics and private outpatient clinics are lower than those of large medical institutions and community health care centers,and hence,it is necessary to improve the management of disinfection and isolation in these clinics.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial 12S rRNA A1555G mutation has been associated with both aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing loss. In this report, we performed a clinical and genetic evaluation, and mitochondrial genome analysis of one hearing-impaired Chinese family carrying the A1555G mutation. Strikingly, the penetrances of hearing loss in this family, which were 81% and 66.7%, respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss was included or excluded. The penetrances of hearing loss in this family were significantly higher than those in other Chinese families carrying the A1555G mutation. Sequence analysis of their mitochondrial genomes revealed the presence of homoplasmic tRNAIle A4317G mutations and 38 mtDNA polymorphisms belonging to East-Asian haplogroup B4c1b2. Further analysis revealed that other mitochondrial DNA variants were not functional significantly, while the A4317G mutation is localized to a highly conserved nucleotide (conventional site 59) at tRNAIle T\u03a8C loop of tRNAIle. The mutation may alter secondary structure and function of this tRNA, thereby leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Allelic analysis showed that this mutation was absent in 961 hearing normal Chinese controls. Thus, the altered tRNAIle metabolism by the A4317G mutation may aggravate mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the A1555G mutation, and contribute to the higher penetrance of hearing loss. Therefore, the tRNAIle A4317G mutation may act as a mitochondrial modifier to influence the phenotypic manifestation of the A1555G mutation.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial 12S rRNA 1555A>G mutation is one of the important causes of aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic deafness. Our previous investigations showed that the A1555G mutation was a primary factor underlying the development of deafness but was insufficient to produce deafness phenotype. However, it has been proposed that mitochondrial haplotypes modulate the phenotypic manifestation of the 1555A>G mutation. Here, we performed systematic and extended mutational screening of 12S rRNA gene in a cohort of 1742 hearing-impaired Han Chinese pediatric subjects from Zhejiang Province, China. Among these, 69 subjects with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic deafness harbored the homoplasmic 1555A>G mutation. These translated to a frequency of \u223c3.96% for the 1555A>G mutation in this hearing\u2013impaired population. Clinical and genetic characterizations of 69 Chinese families carrying the 1555A>G mutation exhibited a wide range of penetrance and expressivity of hearing impairment. The average penetrances of deafness were 29.5% and 17.6%, respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss was included or excluded. Furthermore, the average age-of-onset for deafness without aminoglycoside exposure ranged from 5 and 30 years old, with the average of 14.5 years. Their mitochondrial genomes exhibited distinct sets of polymorphisms belonging to ten Eastern Asian haplogroups A, B, C, D, F, G, M, N, R and Y, respectively. These indicated that the 1555A>G mutation occurred through recurrent origins and founder events. The haplogroup D accounted for 40.6% of the patient\u2019s mtDNA samples but only 25.8% of the Chinese control mtDNA samples. Strikingly, these Chinese families carrying mitochondrial haplogroup B exhibited higher penetrance and expressivity of hearing loss. In addition, the mitochondrial haplogroup specific variants: 15927G>A of haplogroup B5b, 12338T>C of haplogroup F2, 7444G>A of haplogroup B4, 5802T>C, 10454T>C, 12224C>T and 11696G>A of D4 haplogroup, 5821G>A of haplogroup C, 14693A>G of haplogroups Y2 and F, and 15908T>C of Y2 may enhance the penetrace of hearing loss in these Chinese families. Moreover, the absence of mutation in nuclear modifier gene TRMU suggested that TRMU may not be a modifier for the phenotypic expression of the 1555A>G mutation in these Chinese families. These observations suggested that mitochondrial haplotypes modulate the variable penetrance and expressivity of deafness among these Chinese families.

        "abstract": "We report here the characterization of a four-generation Han Chinese family with maternally transmitted diabetes mellitus. Six (two males/four females) of eight matrilineal relatives in this family exhibited diabetes. The age of onset in diabetes varies from 15 years to 33 years, with an average of 26 years. Two of affected matrilineal relatives also exhibited hearing impairment. Molecular analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) showed the presence of heteroplasmic tRNA(Lue(UUR)) A3243G mutation, ranging from 35% to 58% of mutations in blood cells of matrilineal relatives. The levels of heteroplasmic A3243G mutation seem to be correlated with the severity and age-at-onset of diabetes in this family. Sequence analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome in this pedigree revealed the presence of the A3243G mutation and 38 other variants belonging to the Eastern Asian haplogroup M7C. However, none of other mtDNA variants are evolutionarily conserved and implicated to have significantly functional consequence. Thus, the A3243G mutation is the sole pathogenic mtDNA mutation associated with diabetes in this Chinese family.",

        "abstract": "We report here the clinical, genetic and molecular characterization of three Chinese pedigrees with nonsyndromic bilateral hearing loss. Clinical and genetic evaluations revealed the variable severity and age-of-onset in hearing impairment in these families. Strikingly, there were extremely low penetrances of hearing impairment in these Chinese families. Sequence analysis of the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) showed the known A7445C mutation in two pedigrees and the novel A7445T mutation in another pedigree, in addition to distinct sets of mtDNA polymorphisms belong to Asian haplogroups D4j and F4. Indeed, the A7445C or A7445T mutation in the CO1 and the precursor of tRNA Ser(UCN) genes was present in homoplasmy only in the maternal lineage of those pedigrees but not other members of these families and 164 Chinese controls. In fact, the A7445C or A7445T mutation results in a read-through of the stop condon AGA of the CO1 message on the H strand of mtDNA, thereby adding three amino acids (Ser-Gln-Lys) to the C-terminal of the polypeptide. However, the mutated polypeptide may retain a partial function. Alternatively, the A7445C or A7445T mutation is adjacent to the site of 3\u2032 end endonucleolytic processing of L-strand RNA precursor, spanning tRNA Ser(UCN) and ND6 mRNA. Thus, the A7445C or A7445T mutation may also cause a defect in the processing of the L-strand RNA precursor, thus causing mitochondrial dysfunctions. Furthermore, the occurrence of the mutations at position 7445 in these genetically unrelated subjects affected by hearing impairment strongly indicates that mutations at the position 7445 are involved in the pathogenesis of hearing impairment.",

We reported here the clinical and genetic evaluations as well as mutational analysis of mitochondrial DNA(mtDNA) in a three-generation Chinese Han family with maternally transmitted hearing loss and epilepsy. Of 14 matrilineal relatives, three suffered from hearing loss, three had epilepsy, and other did not have significant clinical abnormalities. Sequence analysis of mitochondrial genome in this family identified the novel 7472delC in tRNASer(UCN) and 33 variants belonging to Asian haplogroup B4b1a2. The 7472delC locates at the highly conserved residue of T-arm of this tRNA. In fact, the 7472insC at the same position of this tRNA has been associated with hearing loss and epilepsy in several genetically unrelated families. The 7472insC has been shown to lead to a failure in tRNA metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, 7472delC mutation, similar to 7472insC mutation, may result in the mitochondrial dysfunctions responsible for the hearing loss and epilepsy. Furthermore, none of mutation in deafness-associated GJB2 gene was detected in this Chinese family. Therefore, the 7472delC is likely a new mitochondrial mutation with hearing loss and epilepsy.",

        "abstract": "We report here the clinical and genetic evaluations as well as mutational analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in a four-generation Chinese Han family with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing loss. Strikingly, this family exhibited a high penetrance and expressivity of hearing loss. The penetrances of hearing loss in this family were 75% and 41.7% respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced deafness was included or was excluded. The severity of hearing loss in matrilineal relatives varied from profound hearing loss to normal hearing. Mutational analysis of mtDNA identified the homoplasmic A1555G mutation and a distinct set of mtDNA variants belonging to the Asian haplogroup B5b. Of these, the G15927A mutation absent in 156 Chinese controls is localized at the anticodon-stem of tRNAThr at conventional position 42. The guanine at this position (G42) of tRNAThr is highly conserved from bacteria to human mitochondria. Thus, it is antici-pated that the G15927A disrupted the highly conserved C-G base-pairing at the anticodon-stem of tRNAThr. The alteration of structure of this tRNA likely leads to a failure in tRNA metabolism, thereby worsens the mitochondrial dysfunction asso-ciated with the A1555G mutation. Thus, the G15927A mutation has a potential modifying role in increasing the penetrance and expressivity of hearing loss associated with the deafness-associated 12S rRNA A1555G mutation in this Chinese pedigree.",

        "abstract": "The authors report here the clinical, genetic, molecular and biochemical characterisation of a large five-generation Han Chinese pedigree with maternally transmitted non-syndromic hearing loss. 17 of 35 matrilineal relatives exhibited variable severity and age at onset of sensorineural hearing loss. The average age at onset of hearing loss in matrilineal relatives of this family is 29 years, while matrilineal relatives among families carrying other mitochondrial DNA mutations developed hearing loss with congenital conditions or early age at onset. Molecular analysis of their mitochondrial genome identified the novel heteroplasmic T12201C mutation in the transfer RNA (tRNA)(His) gene. The levels of T12201C mutation in matrilineal relatives of this family correlated with the severity and age at onset of non-syndromic hearing loss. By contrast, other heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA mutations often cause syndromic hearing loss. The T12201C mutation destabilises a highly conservative base-pairing (5A-68U) on the acceptor stem of tRNA(His). tRNA northern analysis revealed that the T12201C mutation caused an \u223c75% reduction in the steady-state level of tRNA(His). An in vivo protein labeling analysis showed an \u223c47% reduction in the rate of mitochondrial translation in cells carrying the T12201C mutation. Impaired mitochondrial translation is apparently a primary contributor to the marked reduction in the rate of overall respiratory capacity, malate/glutamate-promoted respiration, succinate/glycerol-3-phosphate-promoted respiration or N,N,\u0143,\u0143-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine/ascorbate-promoted respiration. These data provide the first direct evidence that mitochondrial dysfunctions caused by the heteroplasmic tRNA(His) mutation lead to late-onset non-syndromic deafness. Thus, the authors' findings provide new insights into the understanding of pathophysiology and valuable information on the management and treatment of maternally inherited hearing loss.",

        "abstract": "To investigate mutational spectrum and frequency of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene in Chinese subjects with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing loss.Total of 456 subjects with non-syndromic hearing loss were recruited from seven schools for deaf-mutes in Zhejiang province. Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood, and then the DNA fragment was amplified spanning the 12S rRNA gene, followed by sequencing and analyzed.Thirty-one variants were identified by mutation analysis of 12S rRNA gene in these subjects. The frequency of the known 1555A > G mutation was 4.4% (20/456). Prevalence of other putative deafness-associated mutation at positions 961 and 1095 were 2.0% (9/456) and 0.7% (3/456) respectively. Furthermore, the 1027A > G, 1109T > C and 1431G > A variants conferred increased sensitivity to ototoxic drugs or non-syndromic deafness as they were absent in 449 Chinese controls and localized at highly conserved nucleotides of this 12S rRNA gene. Moreover, clinical data showed a wide range of age-of-onset, variety of severity and various audiometric configurations in subjects carrying the 1555A > G mutation.Our data demonstrated that the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene is the hot spot for mutations associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity and non-syndromic hearing loss. Nuclear modifier genes, mitochondrial haplotypes and environmental factors might play a role in the phenotypic manifestation of these mutations.",

        "abstract": "We report here on the clinical, genetic, and molecular characterization of three Han Chinese pedigrees with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing loss. Clinical evaluation revealed the variable phenotype of hearing impairment including severity, age-at-onset, audiometric configuration in these subjects. The penetrance of hearing loss in WZD8, WZD9, and WZD10 pedigrees were 46%, 46%, and 50%, respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced deafness was included. When the effect of aminoglycosides was excluded, the penetrance of hearing loss in these pedigrees were 23%, 31%, and 37.5%, respectively. Mutational analysis of the complete mitochondrial genomes showed the homoplasmic A1555G mutation and distinct sets of mitochondrial DNA variants belonging to haplogroups D4b2b, B5b1, and F2, respectively. Of these, the tRNA(Cys) T5802C, tRNA(Thr) A15924C, and ND5 T12338C variants are of special interest as these variants occur at positions which are highly evolutionarily conserved nucleotides of tRNAs or amino acid of polypeptide. These homoplasmic mtDNA variants were absent among 156 unrelated Chinese controls. The T5802C and G15927A variants disrupted a highly conserved A-U or C-G base-pairing at the anticodon-stem of tRNA(Cys) or tRNA(Thr), while the ND5 T12338C mutation resulted in the replacement of the translation-initiating methionine with a threonine, and also located in two nucleotides adjacent to the 3' end of the tRNA(Leu(CUN)). Thus, mitochondrial dysfunctions, caused by the A1555G mutation, would be worsened by these mtDNA variants. Therefore, these mtDNA mutations may have a potential modifier role in increasing the penetrance and expressivity of the deafness-associated 12S rRNA A1555G mutation in those Chinese pedigrees.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been found to be one of the most important causes of sensorineural hearing loss. We report here a clinical, genetic, molecular and biochemical characterization of a Han Chinese pedigree with maternally transmitted nonsyndromic hearing impairment. Seven of nine matrilineal relatives exhibited a variable severity and age-at-onset (8 years old) of hearing loss. Mutational analysis of mtDNA identified the novel homoplasmic tRNA(Ser(UCN)) 7505T>C mutation and other 37 variants belonging to haplogroup F1. The 7505T>C mutation, which is absent in 449 Chinese controls, is located at a highly conserved base-pairing (10A-20U) of tRNA(Ser(UCN)). The abolishment of 10A-20U base-pairing likely alters the tRNA(Ser(UCN)) metabolism. Functional significant of this mutation was supported by approximately 65% reductions in the level of tRNA(Ser(UCN)) observed in the lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying the 7505T>C mutation, compared with the wild-type cell lines. This reduced tRNA level is below the proposed threshold to support a normal respiration in lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, the highly conserved tRNA(Ala) 5587T>C and Cytb C93Y variants may have a modifying role of deafness expression associated with the 7505T>C mutation. However, genotyping analysis of nuclear modifier gene TRMU and the prominent deafness-cause gene GJB2 failed to detect any mutations in the member of this family. These data strongly indicate that the novel tRNA(Ser(UCN)) 7505T>C mutation is involved in maternally transmitted hearing loss. However, other genetic, epigenetic or environmental factors may contribute to the phenotypic variability of this family. Our findings will be helpful for counseling families of maternally inherited hearing loss.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are one of the important causes of deafness. In particular, the 12S rRNA gene is the hot spots for mutations associated with both aminoglycoside ototoxicity and nonsyndromic deafness. In this report, a total of 318 Chinese pediatric hearing-impaired subjects were recruited from otology clinics in the Zhejiang Province, China. These subjects underwent clinical, genetic evaluation and molecular analysis of 12S rRNA gene. Mutational analysis identified 34 variants in the 12S rRNA gene in this cohort. The incidences of the known deafness-associated 1555A>G, 1494C>T and 1095T>C mutations were 9.1%, 0.6% and 1.25% in this cohort, respectively. Other mtDNA variants were evaluated by structural and phylogenetic analysis. Of these, the 839A>G and 1452T>C variants could confer increased sensitivity to aminoglycosides or nonsyndromic deafness as they were not present in 449 Chinese controls and localized at highly conserved nucleotides of the 12S rRNA. However, other variants appeared to be polymorphisms. These data further support the idea that mitochondrial 12S rRNA is one of major targets for aminoglycoside ototoxicity. These data have been providing valuable information to predict which individuals are at risk for ototoxicity, to improve the safety of aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy, and eventually to decrease the incidence of deafness.",

We reported here the clinical, genetic and molecular analysis of a Chinese pedigree with maternally inherited sensorineural hearing loss. Molecular analysis showed that the pedigree carried both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) A1555G and G7444A mutations. The penetrance of hearing loss in this pedigree was 58% when aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss was included. When the effect of aminoglycosides was excluded, the penetrance of hearing loss in this pedigree was 25%. The penetrance of hearing loss was significantly higher than other families carrying only A1555G mutation. Sequence analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome in the proband showed that there were 28 mtDNA polymorphisms belonging to East-Asian haplogroup B4c1. In addition to the deafness-associated A1555G and G7444A mutations, there were no other functionally significant variants found in this family. This indicated that mtDNA G7444A mutation may aggravate mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the A1555G mutation. Therefore, the coexistence of both mtDNA mutations may contribute to high penetrance of hearing loss.",

We report here the clinical, genetic and molecular characterization of 25 Chinese families carrying the A1555G mutation.Clinical and genetic characterizations of these Chinese families exhibited a wide range of penetrance, severity and age-at-onset of hearing impairment. The average penetrances of deafness were 28.1% and 21.5%, respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss was included or excluded. Furthermore, the average age-of-onset for deafness without aminoglycoside exposure ranged from 1 and 15 years old. Their mitochondrial genomes exhibited distinct sets of polymorphisms including 16 novel variants, belonging to ten Eastern Asian haplogroups A, B, D, F, G, M, N and R, respectively. Strikingly, these Chinese families carrying mitochondrial haplogroup B exhibited higher penetrance and expressivity of hearing loss. In addition, 7 known secondary mutations and 21 variants resided at the highly conservative residues may enhance the penetrace of hearing loss in these Chinese families. Moreover, the absence of mutation in GJB2 gene suggested that GJB2 may not be a modifier for the phenotypic expression of the A1555G mutation in these Chinese families. These observations suggested that mitochondrial haplotypes and other modifiers may modulate the variable penetrance and expressivity of deafness among these Chinese families.",

Immunotherapy results in a small overall survival advantage in metastatic RCC,and the therapeutic effects have historically been limited. There is a need to develop more effective drugs. In the molecular biology of RCC,the vascular endothelial growth factor and its related receptor,and the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal transduction pathways are involved in renal carcinogenesis. These signaling pathways and tyrosine kinase receptor lead to proliferation and growth of tumor cells. We have recently developed agents,including multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors,monoclonal antibody and mTOR inhibitors. These agents target the receptor tyrosine kinases and intracellular pathways,and show antitumor effects.

        "abstract": "Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, derived from arachidonic acid, function as antihypertensive and antihypertrophic mediators in the cardiovascular system. They are hydrolyzed by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Pharmacological inhibition of sEH increases the level of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which may have a cardiovascular protective effect. However, the regulation and function of sEH in cancer are largely unknown. The present study investigated whether DNA methylation regulates the expression of sEH in carcinoma HepG2 cells. The mRNA and protein expressions of sEH in HepG2 cells were lower than those in transformed human embryonic kidney cells and in primary cultured human endothelial cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a putative CpG island and 5 SP-1 binding sites located in the promoter region of the sEH gene. Furthermore, the sEH expression was significantly enhanced by demethylation treatment with 5-Aza-CdR, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and the sEH promoter was transformed from hypermethylation to hypomethylation as detected by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Transient transfection assays showed that the activity of the human sEH promoter was increased in HepG2 cells in response to 5-Aza-CdR. Five SP-1 binding sites in the promoter region responding to treatment with 5-Aza-CdR were identified by construct deletion and mutation analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Interestingly, adenoviral overexpression of sEH in HepG2 cells decreased cell proliferation. Thus, SP-1 is involved in the decrease in the transcription of sEH as a result of DNA methylation in HepG2 cells, which might contribute to epigenetic mechanism-induced carcinogenesis in hepatocytes.",

        "abstract": "Derived from arachidonic acid, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids function as antihypertensive and antihypertrophic mediators in the cardiovascular system. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids are generated by soluble epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme hydrolyzing the epoxide moiety of juvenile hormones in insects, and are endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors that induce vessel dilation for cardioprotection. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of soluble epoxide hydrolase increases the level of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Recent findings suggest that the level of soluble epoxide hydrolase in the heart and endothelium is upregulated by angiotensin II in vitro in cultured cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells and in vivo in rodent models. Treatment with soluble epoxide hydrolase-selective inhibitors in angiotensin II-infused hypertensive rats increases the level of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, with attendant decrease in systolic blood pressure. Shear stress, the physiological stimulation of vessel dilation, downregulates soluble epoxide hydrolase and hence increases epoxyeicosatrienoic acid level in endothelial cells. Because of the close association of the angiotensin II/soluble epoxide hydrolase/epoxyeicosatrienoic acid system and blood pressure regulation, pharmacological inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase would be a useful approach to prevent and treat angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension, as well as vascular impairments.",

        "abstract": "Chronic administration of high levels of selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), particularly rofecoxib, valdecoxib, and parecoxib, increases risk for cardiovascular disease. Understanding the possibly multiple mechanisms underlying these adverse cardiovascular events is critical for evaluating the risks and benefits of coxibs and for development of safer coxibs. The current understanding of these mechanisms is likely incomplete. Using a metabolomics approach, we demonstrate that oral administration of rofecoxib for 3 mo results in a greater than 120-fold higher blood level of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), which correlates with a significantly shorter tail bleeding time in a murine model. We tested the hypothesis that this dramatic increase in 20-HETE is attributable to inhibition of its metabolism and that the shortened bleeding time following rofecoxib administration is attributable, in part, to this increase. The s.c. infusion of 20-HETE shortened the tail bleeding time dramatically. Neither 20-HETE biosynthesis nor cytochrome P4A-like immune reactivity was increased by rofecoxib administration, but 20-HETE production increased in vitro with the addition of coxib. 20-HETE is significantly more potent than its COX-mediated metabolites in shortening clotting time in vitro. Furthermore, 20-HETE but not rofecoxib significantly increases rat platelet aggregation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest 20-HETE as a marker of rofecoxib exposure and that inhibition of 20-HETE's degradation by rofecoxib is a partial explanation for its dramatic increase, the shortened bleeding time, and, possibly, the adverse cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib.",

        "abstract": "1. The antidiabetic agents, thiazolidinediones (TZD), ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), have been reported to reduce cardiac hypertrophy. However, the underlying mechanism is still elusive. 2. We previously reported that soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) was specifically upregulated by angiotensin-II (AngII), which directly mediated AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study, we examined the role of sEH in PPAR\u03b3 inhibiting AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy. 3. The protein level of sEH was elevated in the left ventricle of AngII-infused Sprague-Dawley rats. Administration of the TZD rosiglitazone decreased this induction. In vitro, AngII upregulated the expression of sEH and hypertrophy markers, including atrial natriuretic factor and \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells, which was attenuated by rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. An elevated level of sEH was also found in the left ventricle of heterozygous PPAR\u03b3-deficient mice. The effect of TZD on sEH level could be reversed by treatment with the PPAR\u03b3 antagonists, GW9662 and BADGE, which suggests PPAR\u03b3 activation. In elucidating the mechanisms by which PPAR\u03b3 inhibited AngII-induced sEH expression, we found that rosiglitazone inhibited AngII-induced sEH promoter activity in H9c2 cells. In contrast, the activity of the human sEH 3'UTR was not affected by AngII and TZD. 4. Our results suggest that the protective role of PPAR\u03b3 activation in AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy is, at least in part, through downregulating sEH.",

In this study, gene-array analysis revealed that HNF4\u03b1 overexpression increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) greatly in cultured rat primary hepatocytes. PPAR-response-element-driven reporter gene expression could be elevated by HNF4\u03b1. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a high-affinity HNF4\u03b1 binding site in the human PPAR\u03b32 promoter and in vitro experiments showed that this promoter could be transactivated by HNF4\u03b1. The presence of HNF4\u03b1 on the promoter was then confirmed by ChIP assay. In vivo, hepatic overexpression of HNF4\u03b1 decreased cholesterol levels both in plasma and liver and several hepatic genes related to cholesterol metabolism, including scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), were upregulated. The upregulation of SR-BI by HNF4\u03b1 could be inhibited by a PPAR\u03b3 antagonist in vitro. In conclusion, HNF4\u03b1 regulates cholesterol metabolism in rat by modulating the expression of SR-BI in the liver, in which the upregulation of PPAR\u03b3 was involved.",

        "abstract": "Pathophysiological cardiac hypertrophy is one of the most common causes of heart failure. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, hydrolyzed and degraded by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), can function as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors to induce dilation of coronary arteries and thus are cardioprotective. In this study, we investigated the role of sEH in two rodent models of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The protein level of sEH was elevated in the heart of both spontaneously hypertensive rats and Ang II-infused Wistar rats. Blocking the Ang II type 1 receptor with losartan could abolish this induction. Administration of a potent sEH inhibitor (sEHI) prevented the pathogenesis of the Ang II-induced hypertrophy, as demonstrated by decreased left-ventricular hypertrophy assessed by echocardiography, reduced cardiomyocyte size, and attenuated expression of hypertrophy markers, including atrial natriuretic factor and beta-myosin heavy chain. Because sEH elevation was not observed in exercise- or norepinephrine-induced hypertrophy, the sEH induction was closely associated with Ang II-induced hypertrophy. In vitro, Ang II upregulated sEH and hypertrophy markers in neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated from rat and mouse. Expression of these marker genes was elevated with adenovirus-mediated sEH overexpression but decreased with sEHI treatment. These results were supported by studies in neonatal cardiomyocytes from sEH(-/-) mice. Our results suggest that sEH is specifically upregulated by Ang II, which directly mediates Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of sEH would be a useful approach to prevent and treat Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy.",

Targeted eicosanoid metabolomics is used to study the eicosanoid profile in biological samples but only for eicosanoids with available standards. To expand the coverage of eicosanoids detected, we identified the eicosanoids without available standards by estimation of the retention time and comparison of the MS/MS spectra with the reference ones which was collected in a database from literature. Scheduled multiple reaction monitoring- information dependent acquisition- enhanced product ion (sMRM-IDA-EPI) scan mode was applied in this method, which was called Spectrum Evaluation-assisted Eicosanoid Metabolomics (SEEM). By using this method, 243 eicosanoids (167 without standards) could be relatively quantified with precision over 90 percent. We applied the method to analyze the global profile of eicosanoids secreted by human umbilical vascular endothelial cells at the basal level and with n-3 PUFA treatment. 26 putative eicosanoids showed altered levels, despite no available standards. In general, n-3 PUFA treatment increased most of their own metabolites and decreased the epoxy-, hydroxyl- and keto- linoleic acid metabolites. The application of the SEEM method proved its potency of identification and quantification of eicosanoids without standards.",

        "abstract": " Angiogenesis is a complex process regulating endothelial cell (EC) functions. Emerging lines of evidence support that Yes-associated protein (YAP) plays an important role in regulating the angiogenic activity of ECs.  To specify the effect of EC YAP on angiogenesis and its underlying mechanisms.  In ECs, vascular endothelial growth factor reduced YAP phosphorylation time- and dose-dependently and increased its nuclear accumulation. Using Tie2Cre-mediated YAP transgenic (Tie2Cre-YAP) mice, we found that YAP promoted angiogenesis in the postnatal retina and tumor tissues. Mass spectrometry revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a potential binding partner of YAP in ECs. Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays indicated that binding with YAP prolonged interleukin 6-induced STAT3 nuclear accumulation by blocking chromosomal maintenance 1-mediated STAT3 nuclear export without affecting its phosphorylation. Moreover, angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) expression induced by STAT3 was enhanced by YAP overexpression in ECs. Finally, a selective STAT3 inhibitor or Ang2 blockage partly attenuated retinal angiogenesis in Tie2Cre-YAPmice.  YAP binding sustained STAT3 in the nucleus to enhance the latter's transcriptional activity and promote angiogenesis via regulation of Ang2.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent microvascular complications of diabetes and the leading cause of blindness in adults worldwide. Non-proliferative DR (NPDR) is the first stage of DR but currently has few recommended intervention. Eicosanoids play important roles in maintaining vessel homeostasis. However, the functions of eicosanoids in NPDR are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the eicosanoids profile difference in plasma between type 2 diabetes with NPDR or not. A total of 50 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited and divided into non-DR (NDR) group and NPDR group based on fundus photographs. The eicosanoids profiles in plasma were determined by LC-MS/MS. Adhesion and transwell assay were used to detect the adhesion and migration effects of metabolites on primary bovine retinal pericyte cells (BRPC), respectively. Streptomycin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model was used to test the protective effects of selected metabolites according to retinal immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence confocal microscopy. Prostaglandin 2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) was decreased significantly in NPDR group compared to NDR group and negatively correlated with NPDR. In vitro, PGF2\u03b1 was found to accelerate adhesion and migration by activating prostaglandin F receptor (FP receptor) and subsequent increasing RhoA activity in primary bovine retinal pericyte. Administration of PGF2\u03b1 analogue diminished the damage on retinal capillary in an STZ-induced diabetic mouse model. Our results suggested that PGF2\u03b1 may be a protective factor in the progression of NPDR in T2D patients. The protective mechanism of PGF2\u03b1 was to increase pericyte mobility through FP receptor/RhoA pathway.",

        "abstract": "Chronic excessive drinking leads to myocardial contractile dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy, where ethanol toxicity plays an essential role. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases metabolize arachidonic acids to form epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which exert beneficial roles in the cardiovascular system, but their role in alcoholic cardiomyopathy is elusive. This study was designed to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of CYP2J2 gene delivery on ethanol-induced myocardial dysfunction with focus on autophagy and apoptosis. C57BL/6J mice were challenged with a 4% Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet for 8 weeks, before which rAAV9-CYP2J2 was injected via the tail vein. Cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography, haemodynamic measurement, and cardiac histology. The results showed that chronic ethanol intake led to cardiac dilation, contractile dysfunction, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, while CYP2J2 overexpression ameliorated these effects. Additionally, chronic ethanol consumption triggered myocardial autophagosome formation, but impaired autophagic flux via disrupting autophagosome-lysosome fusion, as evidenced by increased LC3 II/I, Beclin-1 and SQSTM1 levels, but reduced LAMP-2 expression. Interestingly, rAAV9-CYP2J2 treatment exerted cardioprotection via restoring autophagic flux in the alcoholic myocardium. Similarly, exogenous 11,12-EET addition significantly restored ethanol-induced neonatal rat cardiomyocyte autophagic flux impairment and inhibited apoptosis, both of which were mediated by AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in vitro. In conclusion, our data suggest that CYP2J2-derived EETs attenuate ethanol-induced myocardial dysfunction through inducing autophagy and reducing apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) dysfunction contributes to diabetes-induced delay in endothelium repair after vessel injury, prominently associated with diabetic cardiovascular complications such as neointima formation. ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) promotes cholesterol efflux to HDL, which may favorably affect EPC function. However, whether ABCG1 improves EPC function, especially in diabetes, remains unknown. Here we investigated the role of ABCG1 in EPCs by using Tie2-mediated ABCG1 transgenic (Tie2- ABCG1) mice. Mice were injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes mellitus. As compared with wild-type (WT) mice, in Tie2- ABCG1 mice, diabetes-impaired EPC migration and tube formation were reversed. In vitro gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies further revealed that ABCG1-overexpressing EPCs showed increased migration and tube formation and differentiation via the Lck/Yes-related novel protein tyrosine kinase /Akt/endothelial NO synthase pathway by enhancing cellular cholesterol efflux. Finally, type 1 and type 2 diabetic mouse models with arterial injury were intravenously injected with labeled EPCs from WT or Tie2- ABCG1 mice. Re-endothelialization in diabetic mice was improved to a greater extent by injection of ABCG1-overexpressing than WT EPCs. Our study demonstrated that ABCG1 in EPCs improved repair after vascular injury in diabetes by increasing EPC function such as migration, tube formation and differentiation, and subsequent re-endothelialization. ABCG1 might be a promising therapeutic target for diabetes-associated vascular diseases.-Shi, Y., Lv, X., Liu, Yan., Li, B., Liu, M., Yan, M., Liu, Yaj., Li, Q., Zhang, X., He, S., Zhu, M., He, J., Zhu, Yan, Zhu, Yi, Ai, D.

        "abstract": "Activated vascular endothelium inflammation under persistent hyperlipidemia is the initial step of atherogenesis. ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) is a crucial factor maintaining sterol and lipid homeostasis by transporting cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of ABCG1 in endothelial inflammation activation during early-stage atherogenesis in mice and the underlying mechanisms. Endothelial cell (EC)-specific ABCG1 transgenic (EC-ABCG1-Tg) mice were generated and cross-bred with low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr(-/-)) mice. After a 4-week Western-type diet, the mice were sacrificed for assessing atherosclerosis. Human umbilical vein ECs were treated with different flows, and ABCG1 was adenovirally overexpressed to investigate the mechanism in\u00a0vitro. Compared with Ldlr(-/-) mouse aortas, EC-ABCG1-Tg/Ldlr(-/-) aortas showed decreased early-stage lesions. Furthermore, the lesion area in the EC-ABCG1-Tg/Ldlr(-/-) mouse aortic arch but not thoracic aorta was significantly reduced, which suggests a protective role of ABCG1 under atheroprone flow. In\u00a0vitro, overexpression of ABCG1 attenuated EC activation caused by oscillatory shear stress. Overexpression of ABCG1 blunted cholesterol-activated ECs in\u00a0vitro. In exploring the mechanisms of ABCG1 attenuating endothelial inflammation, we found that ABCG1 inhibited oscillatory flow-activated nuclear factor kappa B and NLRP3 inflammasome in ECs. ABCG1 may play a protective role in early-stage atherosclerosis by reducing endothelial activation induced by oscillatory shear stress via suppressing the inflammatory response.",

        "abstract": "Local flow patterns determine the uneven distribution of atherosclerotic lesions. This research aims to elucidate the mechanism of regulation of nuclear translocation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) under oscillatory shear stress (OSS) in the atheroprone phenotype of endothelial cells (ECs). We report here that OSS led to tyrosine phosphorylation and strong, continuous nuclear translocation of YAP in ECs that is dependent on integrin \u03b15\u03b21 activation. YAP overexpression in ECs blunted the anti-atheroprone effect of an integrin-\u03b15\u03b21 blocking peptide (ATN161) in Apoe-/- mice. Activation of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 induced tyrosine, but not serine, phosphorylation of YAP in ECs. Blockage of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 with ATN161 abolished the phosphorylation of YAP at Y357 induced by OSS. Mechanistic studies showed that c-Abl inhibitor attenuated the integrin \u03b15\u03b21-induced YAP tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-Abl and YAPY357 was significantly increased in ECs in atherosclerotic vessels of mice and in human plaques vs. normal vessels. Finally, bosutinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, markedly reduced the level of YAPY357 and the development of atherosclerosis in Apoe-/- mice. The c-Abl/YAPY357 pathway serves as a mechanism for the activation of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and the atherogenic phenotype of ECs in response to OSS, and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for atherogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic steatosis is the beginning phase of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a significant risk factor. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) hydrolyzes epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and other epoxy fatty acids, attenuating their cardiovascular protective effects. However, the involvement of sEH in HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis is unknown. The current study aimed to explore the role of sEH in HHcy-induced lipid disorder. We fed 6-week-old male mice a chow diet or 2% (wt/wt) high methione diet for 8 weeks to establish the HHcy model. A high level of homocysteine induced lipid accumulation in vivo and in vitro, which was concomitant with the increased activity and expression of sEH. Treatment with a highly selective specific sEH inhibitor (0.8 mg/kg/day for the animal model and 1 \u03bcM for cells) prevented HHcy-induced lipid accumulation in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of sEH activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), as evidenced by elevated \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and the expression of PPAR\u03b1 target genes in HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis. In primary cultured hepatocytes, the effect of sEH inhibition on PPAR\u03b1 activation was further confirmed by a marked increase in PPAR response element luciferase activity, which was reversed by knock down of PPAR\u03b1. Of note, 11,12-EET ligand-dependently activated PPAR\u03b1. Thus, increased sEH activity is a key determinant in the pathogenesis of HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis, and sEH inhibition could be an effective treatment for HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Rationale  Circulating monocytes play pivotal roles in chronic inflammatory diseases. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), metabolites of arachidonic acid, are known to have anti-inflammatory effects and are hydrolyzed by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH).    Objective  We aimed to investigate the effect of sEH inhibition in atherogenesis.    Methods and results  Mice with low-density lipoprotein receptor deficiency ( Ldlr   \u2212/\u2212  ) with or without sEH inhibitor, and  Ldlr/sEH  double-knockout (DK) mice were fed a Western-type diet (WTD) for 6\u00a0weeks to induce arteriosclerosis. Both sEH inhibition and gene depletion decreased the WTD\u2013induced hyperlipidemia, plaque area and macrophage infiltration in mice arterial wall. Ly6C hi  infiltration of monocytes remained similar in blood, spleen and bone marrow of DK mice, but was decreased in aortic lesions. To further assess the role of sEH or EETs in monocyte/macrophage infiltration in atherogenesis, we transplanted DK bone marrow into  Ldlr   \u2212/\u2212   recipients, and then fed mice the WTD. Aortic lesions and Ly6C hi  monocyte infiltration were reduced in mice with transplanted bone marrow of DK mice without diminishing the cholesterol level. Furthermore, sEH inhibition or gene depletion increased the ratio of EETs/DHETs and diminished the expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) in mice peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. Monocyte adhesion to P-selectin and to tumor necrosis factor \u03b1\u2013activated endothelial cells was also diminished by sEH inhibition.    Conclusion  sEH inhibition and gene depletion attenuated atherosclerosis in mice by decreasing the infiltration of monocytes into the artery wall. EET and PSGL-1 may play pivotal roles in monocyte/macrophage infiltration and atherogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Rationale:  Angiogenesis is a complex process regulating endothelial cell (EC) functions. Emerging lines of evidence support that YAP (Yes-associated protein) plays an important role in regulating the angiogenic activity of ECs.  Objective:  The objective of this study was to specify the effect of EC YAP on angiogenesis and its underlying mechanisms.  Method and Results:  In ECs, vascular endothelial growth factor reduced YAP phosphorylation time and dose dependently and increased its nuclear accumulation. Using Tie2Cre-mediated YAP transgenic mice, we found that YAP promoted angiogenesis in the postnatal retina and tumor tissues. Mass spectrometry revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a potential binding partner of YAP in ECs. Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays indicated that binding with YAP prolonged interleukin 6\u2013induced STAT3 nuclear accumulation by blocking chromosomal maintenance 1\u2013mediated STAT3 nuclear export without affecting its phosphorylation. Moreover, angiopoietin-2 expression induced by STAT3 was enhanced by YAP overexpression in ECs. Finally, a selective STAT3 inhibitor or angiopoietin-2 blockage partly attenuated retinal angiogenesis in Tie2Cre-mediated YAP transgenic mice.  Conclusions:  YAP binding sustained STAT3 in the nucleus to enhance the latter\u2019s transcriptional activity and promote angiogenesis via regulation of angiopoietin-2.",

N-3 PUFA-rich diets feeding or transgene of Fat-1 shifted the eicosanoid profile to an n-3 PUFA dominant style and attenuated the myocardial infarction injury. Multiple logistic regression analysis suggested the degree of MI injury was related with an eicosanoid pattern, composed by eicosanoids derived from both n-3 and n-6 PUFA in the three enzymatic pathways. These results suggested the benefits of n-3 PUFA on MI was achieved synergistically.",

        "abstract": "Endothelial cells regulate vascular tone by producing both relaxing and contracting factors to control the local blood flow. Hypertension is a common side effect of mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) inhibitors. However, the role of endothelial mTORC1 in hypertension remains elusive. The present study aimed to determine the role of endothelial mTORC1 in Ang II (angiotensin II)-induced hypertension and the underlying mechanism. Endothelial mTORC1 activity was increased by Ang II both in vitro and in vivo. Blood pressure was higher in Tie-2-Cre-mediated regulatory associated protein of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin; Raptor) heterozygous-deficient (Tie2Cre-Raptor) mice than control mice both before and after Ang II infusion. Acetylcholine-evoked endothelium-dependent relaxation of mesenteric arteries was impaired in Tie2Cre-Raptor mice. Treatment with indomethacin or a specific COX (cyclooxygenase)-2 inhibitor, NS-398, but not L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in Raptor mice to a similar extent as in Tie2Cre-Raptor mice. Metabolomic profiling revealed that the plasma content of prostaglandin E was reduced in Tie2Cre-Raptor mice with or without Ang II infusion. In endothelial cells, reduction of the protein level of YAP (yes-associated protein) with siRNA-mediated RPTOR deficiency was autophagy dependent and transcriptionally regulated the expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 (microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1). Hence, overexpression of YAP in endothelial cells enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of COX-2 and mPGES-1 and reversed the endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in Tie2Cre-Raptor mice. The present results demonstrate that suppression of mTORC1 activity in endothelial cells reduces prostaglandin E production and causes hypertension by reducing YAP-mediated COX-2/mPGES-1 expression.",

        "abstract": "Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, hydrolyzed by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), have multiple biological functions, including the regulation of vascular tone, renal tubular transport, and being anti-inflammatory. Inhibitors of sEH have been demonstrated to be antihypertensive and renal protective. To elucidate the role of sEH in glomerulonephritis, we first determined the expression of sEH in human kidney by examining biopsies from 153 patients with a variety of glomerulonephritis, including minimal-change, membranous, and IgA nephropathy. Immunohistochemical staining of frozen kidney biopsy samples revealed sEH preferentially expressed in the renal proximal tubular cells, and its expression increased in all patients with glomerulonephritis. The level of sEH in the cortex was positively correlated with proteinuria and negatively with serum albumin level. To investigate the role of sEH in proteinuria-induced renal damage, we incubated purified urine protein from patients with rat renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in vitro. The level of sEH was elevated, as were monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and the process of tubular epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, characterized with increased \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and decreased E-cadherin. These effects were attenuated by administration of a potent sEH inhibitor and mimicked with adenovirus-mediated sEH overexpression. In adriamycin-induced nephropathic mice, sEH inhibitor did not ameliorate proteinuria or level of serum albumin but reduced the long-term elevated serum creatinine level, interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and \u03b1-SMA expression. Thus upregulation of sEH in proximal tubular cells in chronic proteinuric kidney diseases may mediate proteinuria-induced renal damage; sEH inhibition by increasing renal eicosanoid levels could prevent the progression of chronic proteinuric kidney diseases.",

In this study, we investigated whether epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), the catalytic products of cytochrome P450 epoxygenases, are PPARgamma ligands. Competition and direct binding assays revealed that EETs bind to the ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma with K(d) in the microM range. In the presence of adamantyl-ureido-dodecanoic acid (AUDA), a soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)-specific inhibitor, EETs increased PPARgamma transcription activity in endothelial cells and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Inclusion of AUDA in the perfusing media enhanced, but overexpression of sEH reduced, the laminar flow-induced PPARgamma activity. Furthermore, laminar flow augmented cellular levels of EETs but decreased sEH at the levels of mRNA, protein, and activity. Blocking PPARgamma by GW9662 abolished the EET/AUDA-mediated antiinflammatory effect, which indicates that PPARgamma is an effector of EETs.",

        "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with obesity and considered an inflammatory disease. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a major enzyme hydrolyzing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and attenuates their cardiovascular protective and anti-inflammatory effects. We examined whether sEH inhibition can protect against high-fat (HF)-diet-induced fatty liver in mice and the underlying mechanism. Compared with wild-type littermates, sEH-null mice showed lower diet-induced lipid accumulation in liver, as seen by Oil-red O staining and triglycerides levels. We studied the effect of sEH inhibition on diet-induced fatty liver by feeding C57BL/6 mice an HF diet for 8 weeks (short-term) or 16 weeks (long-term) and administering t-AUCB, a selective sEH inhibitor. sEH inhibition had no effect on the HF-diet-increased body and adipose tissue weight or impaired glucose tolerance but alleviated the diet-induced hepatic steatosis. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of sEH in liver increased the level of triglycerides in liver and the hepatic inflammatory response. Surprisingly, the induced expression of sEH in liver occurred only with the long-term but not short-term HF diet, which suggests a secondary effect of HF diet on regulating sEH expression. Furthermore, sEH inhibition attenuated the HF-diet-induced increase in plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines and their mRNA upregulation in adipose tissue, which was accompanied by increased macrophage infiltration. Therefore, sEH inhibition could alleviate HF-diet-induced hepatic steatosis, which might involve its anti-inflammatory effect in adipose tissue and direct inhibition in liver. sEH may be a therapeutic target for HF-diet-induced hepatic steatosis in inhibiting systemic inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine playing important roles in atherosclerosis. MIF gene deficiency and neutralizing antibodies against MIF have been reported to exert anti-atherosclerotic effects in various animal models. However, the mechanism by which MIF is induced in atherosclerotic lesions remains unclear. In the present studies, we cloned a 540bp full-length rabbit MIF cDNA by screening a rabbit uterine library. The cDNA contains a 348bp open-reading frame which encodes a deduced 115-amino acid polypeptide with approximately 90% similarity to human and mouse homologs. Constitutive MIF mRNA expression was detected in most rabbit tissues including aortas. The expression of MIF obviously abounded in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of the atherosclerotic plaques. In cultured VSMCs, MIF expression was significantly induced by a pro-atherogenic factor, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Promoter analysis showed there were two NF-kappaB binding sites in the MIF proximal promoter region. Deletion or mutation of the two sites abolished oxLDL-enhanced MIF promoter activity. Moreover, the induction of MIF by oxLDL can be blocked by IkappaB-alpha overexpression. Taken together, our results revealed that MIF expression can be induced by oxLDL in VSMCs via a NF-kappaB dependent manner, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "The present studies aimed at elucidating the role of prostaglandin E(2) receptor subtype 3 (E-prostanoid [EP] 3) in regulating blood pressure.Mice bearing a genetic disruption of the EP3 gene (EP(3)(-/-)) exhibited reduced baseline mean arterial pressure monitored by both tail-cuff and carotid arterial catheterization. The pressor responses induced by EP3 agonists M&B28767 and sulprostone were markedly attenuated in EP3(-/-) mice, whereas the reduction of blood pressure induced by prostaglandin E(2) was comparable in both genotypes. Vasopressor effect of acute or chronic infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II) was attenuated in EP3(-/-) mice. Ang II-induced vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries decreased in EP3(-/-) group. In mesenteric arteries from wild-type mice, Ang II-induced vasoconstriction was inhibited by EP3 selective antagonist DG-041 or L798106. The expression of Arhgef-1 is attenuated in EP3 deficient mesenteric arteries. EP3 antagonist DG-041 diminished Ang II-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain 20 and myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 in isolated mesenteric arteries. Furthermore, in vascular smooth muscle cells, Ang II-induced intracellular Ca(2+) increase was potentiated by EP3 agonist sulprostone but inhibited by DG-041.Activation of the EP3 receptor raises baseline blood pressure and contributes to Ang II-dependent hypertension at least partially via enhancing Ca(2+) sensitivity and intracellular calcium concentration in vascular smooth muscle cells. Selective targeting of the EP3 receptor may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Lipid-mediated injury plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many renal diseases including diabetic nephropathy. Liver X receptor-alpha (LXRalpha) is an intracellular sterol sensor that regulates expression of genes controlling cholesterol absorption, excretion, catabolism, and cellular efflux. The present study was aimed at examining the role of LXRalpha in cholesterol metabolism in glomerular mesangial cells. A 1,561-bp fragment of full-length rabbit LXR cDNA was cloned. The deduced protein sequence exhibited 92.4 and 89.2% identity to human and mouse LXRalpha, respectively. Tissue distribution studies showed that rabbit LXRalpha was expressed in the liver, spleen, and kidney. In situ hybridization and RT-PCR assays further indicated that LXRalpha mRNA was widely expressed in the kidney and present in every nephron segment including the glomeruli. To determine intrarenal regulation of LXRalpha, rabbits were treated with thiazolidinedione (TZD) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonists, which have been previously shown to enhance LXRalpha expression via PPARgamma and increase cholesterol efflux in macrophages. The results showed that glomerular LXRalpha expression was markedly induced by TZDs. In cultured rabbit mesangial cells, LXRalpha mRNA and protein were detected by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Treatment of mesangial cells with a specific LXRalpha agonist, TO-901317, significantly increased basal and apolipoprotein AI-mediated cholesterol efflux and markedly enhanced the promoter activity of an LXRalpha target gene, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). In conclusion, LXRalpha is expressed in renal glomeruli and functionally present in mesangial cells where its activation mediates cholesterol efflux via ABCA1. These data suggest that LXRalpha may be a potential therapeutic target for treating lipid-related renal glomerular disease.",

Inhibition of mTOR significantly stimulated expression of gastric ghrelin mRNA and protein, and the concentration of plasma ghrelin (2.06\u00b10.34 ng/ml vs. 12.53\u00b13.9 ng/ml, p<0.05), inhibited gastrin synthesis and secretion (75.01\u00b16.71 pg/ml vs. 54.04\u00b13.65 pg/ml, p<0.05), but had no effect on somatostatin production (165.2\u00b125.07 pg/ml vs. 178.9\u00b129.14 pg/ml, p=0.73). Gastric mTOR is a gastric sensor whose activity is linked to the differential regulation of gastric hormone production and release.",

        "abstract": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been reported to modulate angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, by promoting proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. Endothelial progenitor cells are known as a subset of circulating bone marrow mononuclear cells that have the capacity to differentiate into endothelial cells. However, the mechanism underlying the stimulatory effects of PGE2 and its specific receptors on bone marrow-derived cells (BMCs) in angiogenesis has not been fully characterized. Treatment with PGE2 significantly increased the differentiation and migration of BMCs. Also, the markers of differentiation to endothelial cells, CD31 and von Willebrand factor, and the genes associated with migration, matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9, were significantly upregulated. This upregulation was abolished by dominant-negative AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK inhibitor but not protein kinase, a inhibitor. As a functional consequence of differentiation and migration, the tube formation of BMCs was reinforced. Along with altered BMCs functions, phosphorylation and activation of AMPK and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, the target of activated AMPK, were both increased which could be blocked by EP4 blocking peptide and simulated by the agonist of EP4 but not EP1, EP2 or EP3. The pro-angiogenic role of PGE2 could be repressed by EP4 blocking peptide and retarded in EP4(+/-) mice. Therefore, by promoting the differentiation and migration of BMCs, PGE2 reinforced their neovascularization by binding to the receptor of EP4 in an AMPK-dependent manner. PGE2 may have clinical value in ischemic heart disease.",

        "abstract": "Cells residing in the hypertonic, hypoxic renal medulla depend on dynamic adaptation mechanisms to respond to changes in energy supply and demand. The serine/threonine kinase 5'-AMP protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellular energy status, but whether it contributes to the survival of cells in the renal medulla is unknown. Here, hypertonic conditions induced a decrease in AMPK phosphorylation within 12 hours in renal medullary interstitial cells (RMIC), followed by a gradual return to baseline levels. Activation of AMPK markedly increased hypertonicity-induced apoptosis of RMICs and suppressed both hypertonicity-induced NF\u03baB nuclear translocation and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activation; overexpression of COX-2 significantly attenuated these effects. AMPK activation also markedly reduced generation of reactive oxygen species and nuclear expression of tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein, which prevented upregulation of osmoprotective genes. In vivo, pharmacologic activation of AMPK led to massive apoptosis of RMICs and renal dysfunction in the setting of water deprivation in mice. Taken together, these results identify a critical role for AMPK in the maintenance of RMIC viability and suggest that AMPK modulates the NF\u03baB-COX-2 survival pathway in the renal medulla. Furthermore, this study raises safety concerns for the development of AMPK activators as anti-diabetic drugs, especially for patients prone to dehydration.",

        "abstract": "Restenosis after angioplasty remains a major clinical problem. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) plays an important role in vascular homeostasis. The PGE(2) receptor E-prostanoid 2 (EP2) is involved in the proliferation and migration of various cell types. We aimed to determine the role of EP2 in the pathogenesis of neointimal formation after vascular injury.Wire-mediated vascular injury was induced in the femoral arteries of male wild-type (EP2+/+) and EP2 gene-deficient (EP2-/-) mice. In EP2+/+ mice, EP2 mRNA expression was increased in injured vessels for at least 4 weeks after vascular injury. Neointimal hyperplasia was markedly accelerated in EP2-/- mice, which was associated with increased proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and increased cyclin D1 expression in the neointima layer. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) treatment resulted in more significant cell proliferation and migration in VSMCs of EP2-/- mice than in those of EP2+/+ mice. Activation and overexpression of EP2 attenuated PDGF-BB-elicited cell proliferation and migration, induced G(1)\u2192S-phase arrest and reduced PDGF-BB-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in EP2+/+ VSMCs.These findings reveal a novel role of the EP2 receptor in neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury. The EP2 receptor may represent a potential therapeutic target for restenosis after angioplasty.",

The \"pleiotropic\" effects include the prevention of inflammation and proliferation of vascular cells. Here, we studied whether heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an important cytoprotective molecule, is induced by simvastatin and the role of HO-1 in the pleiotropic effects of simvastatin.Human and rat aortic smooth muscle cells treated with simvastatin showed an elevated level of HO-1 for up to 24 hours. The induction of HO-1 by simvastatin was not found in cultured endothelial cells and macrophages. Injecting C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally with simvastatin increased the level of HO-1 in vascular SMCs (VSMCs) in the tunica media. Treating VSMCs with zinc protoporphyrin, an HO-1 inhibitor, or HO-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked the antiinflammatory effect of simvastatin, including the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activation and nitric oxide production. Blockade of HO-1 also abolished the simvastatin-induced p21(Waf1) and the associated antiproliferative effect. Simvastatin activated p38 and Akt in VSMCs, and the respective inhibitors of p38 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) greatly reduced the level of simvastatin-induced HO-1, which suggests the involvement of p38 and the PI3K-Akt pathway in HO-1 induction.Simvastatin activates HO-1 in VSMCs in vitro and in vivo. The antiinflammatory and antiproliferative effects of simvastatin occur largely through the induced HO-1.",

        "abstract": "By stimulating the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor. However, the molecular mechanism involved in the VEGF-induced angiogenesis remains elusive. We hypothesized that sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), transcription factors governing cellular lipid homeostasis, play an important role in regulating angiogenesis in response to VEGF. VEGF activated SREBP1 and SREBP2 in ECs, as demonstrated by the increased SREBPs, their cleavage products, and the upregulation of the targeted genes. VEGF-induced SREBP activation depended on SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), because knocking down SCAP by RNA interference (RNAi) inhibited SREBP activation in response to VEGF. SREBP activation was also blocked by 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). To verify the functional implication of SREBPs in VEGF-induced angiogenesis, we tested the role of SREBPs in EC migration and proliferation. SCAP RNAi or 25-HC inhibited VEGF-induced pseudopodia extension and migration of ECs. Both treatments inhibited VEGF-induced EC proliferation, with cell growth arrested at the G(0)/G(1) phase and a concomitant decrease of the S phase. Blocking the PI3K-Akt pathway inhibited the VEGF-activated SREBPs, demonstrating that PI3K-Akt regulates SREBPs. Consistent with our in vitro data, SREBP1 was detected in newly developed microvasculatures in a rabbit skin partial-thickness wound-healing model. SREBP inhibition also markedly suppressed VEGF-induced angiogenesis in chick embryos. In summary, this study identifies SREBPs as the key molecules in regulating angiogenesis in response to VEGF.",

        "abstract": "The liver X receptors (LXRs) regulate a set of genes involved in lipid metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. We investigated the mechanism by which shear stress regulates LXR in vascular endothelial cells (ECs).Western blot showed that the protein level of LXRalpha and its target ABCA1 in the mouse thoracic aorta was higher than that in the aortic arch. As well, the mRNA level of LXR and its target genes ABCA1, ABCG1, ApoE, and LPL in the thoracic aorta was higher. In vitro, bovine aortic ECs were subjected to a steady laminar flow (12 dyne/cm2). The expressions of LXR and the LXR-mediated transcription were increased by laminar shear stress. Laminar flow increased LXR-ligand binding and the gene expression of sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27), which suggests an increased level of LXR ligand in ECs. This effect was attenuated by LXRalpha and CYP27 RNAi. The decrease of LXR in the aorta of PPARgamma+/- mice and that of C57 mice fed with PPARgamma antagonist suggest the involvement of PPARgamma in the LXR induction by flow.Laminar flow increases LXR function via a PPARgamma-CYP27 dependent mechanism, which reveals an atheroprotective role for laminar flow exerting on endothelium.",

This report describes the effect of copper-catalyzed oxLDL on the regulation of ABCA1 in human endothelial cells (ECs).oxLDL downregulated ABCA1 at both mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of oxLDL was observed with both minimally and extensively oxLDL. Transfection of the ABCA1 promoter luciferase revealed oxLDL to substantially decrease ABCA1 promoter activity at basal conditions and after stimulation by overexpressing the liver X receptor LXRalpha and retinoid X receptor RXRalpha. oxLDL also attenuated LXR activation by blocking LXR ligand binding and interfering with the generation of 27-hydroxycholesterol, an LXR endogenous ligand. Furthermore, oxLDL inhibited exogenous cholesterol- and oxysterol-induced endothelial ABCA1 induction.oxLDL downregulated ABCA1 by inhibiting LXR activation in endothelial cells.

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Steady laminar flow is atheroprotective, in part because of its antiinflammatory effects on vascular endothelial cells (ECs). We studied the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR) in ECs in response to laminar flow and the associated antiinflammatory effect. Methods and Results\u2014Using flow channel with cultured ECs, we found that laminar flow activated the PPAR-mediated PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) activity and increased the mRNA encoding CD36, a PPAR-targeted gene. Analysis of the CD36 promoter revealed that PPRE was required for flow activation. Laminar flow induced the GAL-PPAR- LBD fusion protein, which suggests that flow activation of PPAR was ligand dependent. The pharmaceutical inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and cytochrome P450 epoxygenases (CYP450s) were able to block the laminar flow-activated PPAR. We also showed that lipid extracts from flow media contained ligands for the activation of PPAR in other cell types. This paracrine activation exerted antiinflammatory effects in ECs and THP-1 cells, including the suppression of cytokine-induced nuclear factor-B activation and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Conclusions\u2014Laminar flow activates endogenous PPAR in ECs, which is ligand dependent. The flow production of PPAR ligands is through the PLA2-CYP450 pathway, and the induced PPAR ligands exert antiinflammatory effects in several types of cells. (Circulation. 2004;110:1128-1133.)",

In studying the gene expression and regulation of ABCA1 in human vascular endothelial cells (ECs), we found that native low density lipoprotein (LDL) elevates ABCA1 in both protein and mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Transfection of full-length human ABCA1 in ECs lowers cellular cholesterol content and increases apolipoprotein (apo) A-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. Transfection of the ABCA1 promoter-luciferase reporter results in a 2-fold induction after LDL exposure. The responsive element was mapped within -116 to -54 of the promoter region with use of promoter deletion constructs, as reported in other cells. A mutation of the DR4 site greatly diminished the LDL effect. Results showing that LDL increases the liver X receptor responsive element (LXRE)-driven luciferase activity demonstrate the effect of LDL on LXR activation. Furthermore, ligands of the retinoid X receptor and LXR activate ABCA1 in ECs at levels of both promoter activation and mRNA induction. Therefore, ABCA1 is expressed in vascular ECs and is transcriptionally upregulated by LDL. Overexpression of ABCA1 in these cells prevents overloading of cholesterol by increasing the efflux of cholesterol. Thus, ABCA1 plays an important role in the homeostasis of cholesterol in the vascular endothelium.",

        "abstract": "The migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays an essential role during the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis. Extensive studies have implicated the importance of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteinases in VSMC migration. A recently described family of proteinases, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTs), is capable of degrading vascular ECM proteins. Here, we sought to determine whether ADAMTS-7 is involved in VSMC migration and neointima formation in response to vascular injury. ADAMTS-7 protein accumulated preferentially in neointima of the carotid artery wall after balloon injury. In primary VSMCs, ADAMTS-7 level was enhanced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha and growth factor platelet-derived growth factor-BB. ADAMTS-7 overexpression greatly accelerated and small interfering RNA knockdown markedly retarded VSMC migration/invasion in vitro. In addition, luminal delivery of ADAMTS-7 adenovirus to carotid arteries exacerbated intimal thickening nearly sixfold 7 days after injury. Conversely, perivascular administration of ADAMTS-7 small interfering RNA but not scramble small interfering RNA to injured arteries attenuated intimal thickening by 50% at 14 days after injury. Furthermore, ADAMTS-7 mediated degradation of the vascular ECM cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in injured vessels. Replenishing COMP circumvented the promigratory effect of ADAMTS-7 on VSMCs. Enforced expression of COMP significantly suppressed VSMC migration and neointima formation postinjury, which indicates that ADAMTS-7 facilitated intimal hyperplasia through degradation of inhibitory matrix protein COMP. ADAMTS-7 may therefore serve as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and postangioplasty restenosis.",

        "abstract": "Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), synthesized from arachidonic acid by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases, are converted to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids by soluble epoxide hydrolase. EETs exert anti-inflammatory effects. However, the effect of EETs on humoral immunity is poorly understood. The present study is to investigate the potential role of EETs on B cell function and mechanisms. We examined the role of EETs on antibody production of splenic B cells from C57BL/6 and apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice by means of ELISA. Of the 4 EET regioisomers, 8,9-EET decreased basal and activation-induced B cell antibody secretion. As well, 8,9-EET significantly inhibited B-cell proliferation and survival, plasma cell differentiation and class-switch recombination. Western blot analysis revealed that lipopolysaccharide-induced nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB could be attenuated by 8,9-EET. Furthermore, germinal center formation was impaired by 8,9-EET in mice in vivo. 8,9-EET may inhibit B-cell function in vitro and in vivo, which suggests a new therapeutic strategy for diseases with excess B cell activation.",

        "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), as an independent risk factor of atherosclerosis, facilitates endothelial dysfunction and activation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, little is known about the crosstalk between endothelial cells (ECs) and VSMCs under HHcy. We investigated whether homocysteine (Hcy) activates VSMCs by aberrant secretion of mitogen platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) from ECs in human and in mice. In this study, we found that increased Hcy level did not affect VSMC activity in 24 hrs until the concentration reached 500 \u03bcM. In contrast, Hcy at 100 \u03bcM significantly promoted proliferation and migration of VSMCs co-cultured with human ECs. This effect was partially reversed by pretreatment with a PDGF receptor inhibitor. Hcy concentration-dependently upregulated the mRNA level of PDGF-A, -C and -D but not PDGF-B in ECs. Hcy reduced the expression and activity of DNA methyltransferase 1, demethylation of PDGF-A, -C and -D promoters and enhanced the binding activity of transcriptional factor SP-1 to the promoter. Hcy upregulation of PDGF was confirmed in the aortic intima of mice with HHcy. Multivariate regression analysis revealed HHcy was a predictor of increased serum PDGF level in patients. Thus, Hcy upregulates PDGF level via DNA demethylation in ECs, affects cross-talk between ECs and VSMCs and leads to VSMC activation.",

        "abstract": "A number of epidemiological studies have suggested an association of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), but discrepancies exist. In addition, we lack direct evidence supporting a causal role.We determined the association and contribution of HHcy to AAA formation.We first performed a meta-analysis of studies involving 1489 subjects and found a strong association of HHcy and AAA (odds ratio, 7.39). Next, we used angiotensin II-infused male apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and tested whether HHcy contributes to AAA pathogenesis. Homocysteine (Hcy) supplement (1.8 g/L) in drinking water resulted in mild HHcy. Intriguingly, HHcy greatly increased the incidence of angiotensin II-induced AAA and aortic dissection in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (vehicle versus Hcy: 50% versus 100%; P<0.05). Histology indicated HHcy markedly exaggerated aortic adventitial inflammation. Increased levels of proinflammatory interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were preferentially colocalized within adventitial fibroblasts in HHcy plus angiotensin II mice, which suggested the importance of adventitial fibroblasts activation in Hcy-aggravated AAA. Hcy sequentially stimulated adventitial fibroblasts transformation into myofibroblasts, secretion of interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and consequent recruitment of monocytes/macrophages to adventitial fibroblasts, which was abolished by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium. NADPH oxidase 4, but not other homologs of NADPH oxidase, was significantly upregulated by Hcy in adventitial fibroblasts, whereas NADPH oxidase 4 small interfering RNA silencing diminished Hcy-induced adventitial fibroblasts activation. Finally, folic acid supplement (0.071 \u03bcg/g per day) markedly reduced HHcy-aggravated angiotensin II-induced AAA formation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.HHcy may aggravate AAA formation at least partially via activating adventitial fibroblast NADPH oxidase 4.",

        "abstract": "Vascular calcification significantly increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We recently reported that the deficiency of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) leads to vascular mineralization. We characterized the COMP-degrading metalloproteinase, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-7 (ADAMTS-7). Here, we tested whether ADAMTS-7 facilitates vascular calcification.ADAMTS-7 expression was markedly upregulated in calcifying rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro, calcified arteries of rats with chronic renal failure in vivo, and radial arteries of uraemic patients. Silencing of ADAMTS-7 markedly reduced COMP degradation and ameliorated VSMC calcification, whereas ectopic expression of ADAMTS-7 greatly enhanced COMP degradation and exacerbated mineralization. The transcriptional activity of ADAMTS-7 promoter was not altered by high phosphate. We used bioinformatics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis to demonstrate that high-phosphate upregulated ADAMTS-7 mRNA and protein via miR-29a/b repression, which directly targeted the 3' untranslated region of ADAMTS-7 in VSMCs. MicroRNA (MiR)-29a/b mimic markedly inhibited but miR-29a/b inhibitor greatly enhanced high-phosphate-induced ADAMTS-7 expression, COMP degradation, and subsequent VSMC calcification. ADAMTS-7 silencing significantly diminished miR-29a/b repression-exaggerated VSMC calcification.Our data reveal a novel mechanism by which ADAMTS-7 upregulation by miR-29a/b repression mediates vascular calcification, which may shed light on preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

COMP (-/-) mice, both male and female, developed DCM spontaneously at young age (3-5 months), with impaired cardiac function. Assessment of postnatal COMP (-/-) heart at 1 month, although functionally normal, revealed severe cardiac ultrastructure defect, in parallel with cardiomyocyte apoptosis, myofilament loss, connexin-43 deficiency and matrix metalloproteinase activation. Decreased COMP expression was observed in the heart sample of DCM patients compared with donor heart. Mechanistically, COMP (-/-) heart exhibited reduced integrin \u03b21 expression and signaling. Ectopic expression of COMP or integrin \u03b21 rescued COMP-deficiency-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, myofilament dissolution, and connexin-43 aberrance. Additionally, COMP directly bonded to the extracellular \u03b2-tail domain of integrin \u03b21, prevented integrin \u03b21 ubiquitination/degradation, and maintained the cardiac homeostasis.

        "title": "Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein maintains the contractile phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells by interacting with \u03b17\u03b21 integrin",
        "abstract": "RATIONAL: Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) switching from a contractile/differentiated to a synthetic/dedifferentiated phenotype has an essential role in atherosclerosis, postangioplastic restenosis and hypertension. However, how normal VSMCs maintain the differentiated state is less understood. Objective: We aimed to indentify the effect of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a normal vascular extracellular matrix, on modulation of VSMCs phenotype. Methods And Results: We demonstrated that COMP was associated positively with the expression of VSMC differentiation marker genes during phenotype transition. Knockdown of COMP by small interfering (si)RNA favored dedifferentiation. Conversely, adenoviral overexpression of COMP markedly suppressed platelet-derived growth factor-BB-elicited VSMC dedifferentiation, characterized by altered VSMC morphology, actin fiber organization, focal adhesion assembly, and the expression of phenotype-dependent markers. Whereas \u03b17 integrin coimmunoprecipitated with COMP in normal rat VSMCs and vessels, neutralizing antibody or siRNA against \u03b17 integrin inhibited VSMC adhesion to COMP, which indicated that \u03b17\u03b21 integrin is a potential receptor for COMP. As well, blocking or interference by siRNA of \u03b17 integrin completely abolished the effect of COMP on conserving the contractile phenotype. In accordance, ectopic adenoviral overexpression of COMP greatly retarded VSMC phenotype switching, rescued contractility of carotid artery ring, and inhibited neointima formation in balloon-injured rats. Conclusions: Our data suggest that COMP is essential for maintaining a VSMC contractile phenotype and the protective effects of COMP are mainly mediated through interaction with \u03b17\u03b21 integrin. Investigations to identify the factors affecting the expression and integrity of COMP may provide a novel therapeutic target for vascular disorders. \u00a9 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Vascular calcification is a significant contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We recently reported that cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is pivotal for maintaining the homeostasis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Whether COMP affects the process of vascular calcification is unknown.We aimed to test whether COMP modulates vascular calcification.VSMC calcification in vitro was induced by calcifying media containing high inorganic phosphate or calcium. In vivo medial vessel calcification was induced in rats by 5/6 nephrectomy with a high-phosphate diet or by periadventitial application of CaCl(2) to the abdominal aorta. COMP protein level was markedly reduced in both calcified VSMCs and arteries. COMP deficiency remarkably exacerbated VSMC calcification, whereas ectopic expression of COMP greatly reduced calcification. Furthermore, COMP knockdown facilitated osteogenic markers expression by VSMCs even in the absence of calcifying media. By contrast, COMP overexpression significantly inhibited high phosphate- or high calcium-induced VSMC osteochondrogenic transition. Induction of osteogenic marker expression by COMP silencing was reversed by a soluble form of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 receptor IA, which suggests a BMP-2-dependent mechanism. Our data revealed that COMP bound directly to BMP-2 through the C terminus, inhibited BMP-2 receptor binding, and blocked BMP-2 osteogenic signaling, indicating COMP inhibits osteochondrogenic transition of VSMCs at least partially through inhibiting BMP-2.Our data strongly suggest that COMP is a novel inhibitor of vascular calcification. The imbalance between the effects of COMP and BMP-2 may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of vascular calcification.",

        "abstract": "Chronic administration of selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors leads to an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification, a common complication of chronic kidney disease, is directly related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Here, we tested whether specific COX-2 inhibition affects vascular calcification during chronic renal failure.The COX-2-specific inhibitors NS398 and SC236 significantly increased high-phosphate (Pi)-induced VSMC calcification. Similarly, COX-2(-/-) VSMCs, COX-2(-/-) aortas rings treated with high Pi and adenine diet-induced COX-2(-/-) chronic renal failure mice displayed enhanced calcium deposition. Metabolomic analysis revealed the differential suppression of PGE2 production by COX-1- and COX-2-specific inhibitors in high-Pi-stimulated VSMCs, indicating the involvement of PGE2 during COX-2 inhibition-aggravated vascular calcification. Indeed, exogenous PGE2 reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, osteogenic transdifferentiation, apoptosis, and calcification of VSMCs. In accordance, downregulation of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-1 in VSMCs, mPGES-1(-/-) aorta with high-Pi stimulation and mPGES-1(-/-) chronic renal failure mice resulted in enhanced vascular mineralization. Further applications of RNAi and specific antagonists for PGE2 receptors indicated EP4 may mediate PGE2-inhibited vascular calcification.Our data revealed the pivotal role of COX-2-mPGES-1-PGE2 axis in vascular calcification. The selective inhibition of COX-2 or mPGES-1 may increase the risk of calcification and subsequent adverse cardiovascular events during chronic renal failure.",

This study investigated the effect of cholesterol on the movement of caveolae-related proteins in human umbilical vein ECs with use of caveolae functional proteomics. After cholesterol exposure to ECs for 2 to 4 h, caveolae were isolated and separated on 2-D protein gels. Among 40 protein spots revealed in caveolae fractions, the ATP synthase beta subunit (ATPS-beta), one of the 3 proteins enriched by cholesterol in caveolae, was confirmed by western blotting and confocal microscopy. Further, cholesterol exposure increased the level of ATPS-beta, along with Cav-1 and cholesterol in caveolae. These effects could be blocked by cytochalasin B, an actin cytoskeleton disruptor. ATPS-beta was physically associated with Cav-1, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST-Cav-1 fusion protein pull-down assay. Cholesterol increased the extracellular ATP release mediated by ATPS-beta, since this action could be blocked by piceatannol or oligomycin, ATPS inhibitors. Thus, the ectopic localization of ATPS-beta may participate in the energy balance of cells in response to the change in intracellular cholesterol levels.",

We examined whether caveolae are involved in monocyte adhesion to ECs responding to a synergy of hypercholesterolemia and inflammation. Treating human umbilical vein ECs with cholesterol enhanced endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte adhesion. Use of isolated caveolae-enriched membranes revealed that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), co-localized with Cav-1 in caveolae. LPS upregulated CAMs expression and increased the co-localization. Cholesterol exposure decreased the level of CAMs in the caveolae. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy revealed that ICAM-1 interacted with Cav-1. Electron microscopy showed that ICAM-1 was mainly located in caveolae. Cholesterol exposure decreased this interaction and drove ICAM-1 out of caveolae. Knockdown of Cav-1 reduced the synergistic effects of cholesterol and inflammation. In vivo, ICAM-1 and Cav-1 co-localization was lower in the aortic endothelium of ApoE(-)(/)(-) mice than in that of wild-type controls. Cav-1 negatively regulates monocyte adhesion by the co-localization of CAMs in caveolae, which is disturbed by cholesterol. Thus, our study suggests a molecular basis underlying the synergistic effects of hypercholesterolemia and inflammation in atherogenesis.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE: Endothelial cells (ECs) have distinct mechanotransduction mechanisms responding to laminar versus disturbed flow patterns. Endothelial dysfunction, affected by imposed flow, is one of the earliest events leading to atherogenesis. The involvement of \u03b3/\u03c3 T lymphocytes in endothelial dysfunction under flow is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether shear stress regulates membrane translocation of ATP synthase \u03b2 chain (ATPS\u03b2) in ECs, leading to the increased \u03b3/\u03c3 T-lymphocyte adhesion and the related functions. METHOD AND RESULTS: We applied different flow patterns to cultured ECs. Laminar flow decreased the level of membrane-bound ATPS\u03b2 (ecto-ATPS\u03b2) and depleted membrane cholesterol, whereas oscillatory flow increased the level of ecto-ATPS\u03b2 and membrane cholesterol. Incubating ECs with cholesterol or depleting cellular cholesterol with \u03b2-cyclodextrin mimicked the effect of oscillatory or laminar flow, respectively. Knockdown caveolin-1 by small interfering RNA prevented ATPS\u03b2 translocation in response to laminar flow. Importantly, oscillatory flow or cholesterol treatment elevated the number of \u03b3/\u03c3 T cells binding to ECs, which was blocked by anti-ATPS\u03b2 antibody. Furthermore, the incubation of \u03b3/\u03c3 T cells with ECs increased tumor necrosis fact \u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3 secretion from T cells and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression in ECs. In vivo, \u03b3/\u03c3 T-cell adhesion and ATPS\u03b2 membrane translocation was elevated in the aortic inner curvature and disturbed flow areas in partially ligated carotid arteries of ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that disturbed flow and hypercholesterolemia synergistically promote \u03b3/\u03c3 T-lymphocyte activation by the membrane translocation of ATPS\u03b2 in ECs and in vivo in mice, which is a novel mechanism of endothelial activation. \u00a9 2011 American Heart Association, Inc.",

Application of a shear stress (12 dyn/cm(2)) caused the proteolytic cleavage of SREBP1 and the ensuing translocation of its transcription factor domain into the nucleus. As a result, shear stress increased the mRNAs encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), as well as the binding of (125)I-LDL. Using a step flow channel, we showed that SREBP1 activation in ECs under laminar flow is transient, but disturbed flow causes sustained activation. In studying the shear stress-elicited molecular signaling that activates SREBP1, we found that blocking the beta(1)-integrin with the AIIB2 blocking-type monoclonal antibody inhibited SREBP1 activation induced by shear stress. EC attachment to fibronectin or the activation of beta(1)-integrin in the suspended ECs by the TS2/16 monoclonal antibody was sufficient for SREBP1 activation. Furthermore, transient transfection assays showed that dominant-negative mutants of focal adhesion kinase and c-Src attenuated the shear stress-increased LDLR promoter activity. These results demonstrate that integrin signaling plays a critical role in the modulation of SREBP in ECs in response to shear stress.",

        "abstract": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) has been shown to perturb endothelial cells, with manifestations ranging from alterations in free radicals and arachidonate metabolism to stress fiber formation and monocyte recruitment. Some of these changes are regulated by LDL at the transcriptional level. Using mobility shift assays with consensus sequences for various transcription factors, we have detected an increase in activator protein 1 (AP-1), but not nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), binding in human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to LDL. Following transfection, AP-1-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and AP-1-driven-luciferase are upregulated by LDL. In contrast, there is no effect on NF-kappaB-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. AP-1 increases in a biphasic fashion, with the first peak occurring 6 hours after and the second 48 hours after exposure to LDL. This AP-1 binding increase involves c-Jun, but not c-Fos, as shown by gel supershift, Northern hybridization, and Western blotting analyses. c-Jun mRNA levels are elevated by 9 hours after and remain so until at least 24 hours after exposure to LDL. c-Jun protein levels increase at 12 hours and continue to rise for 24 hours after exposure to LDL. Moreover, this LDL-increased AP-1 binding is suppressed by several protein kinase (PK) inhibitors: the PKC inhibitor calphostin C, the cAMP-dependent PK inhibitor H89, and the tyrosine PK inhibitors genistein and lavendustin A. This study demonstrates that (1) LDL is an endothelial agonist distinct from other cell stimulators, such as cytokines, endotoxin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, because LDL appears to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cells predominantly through the transcription factor AP-1 and not NF-kappaB; and (2) LDL increases AP-1 via mechanisms involving multiple kinase activities and c-Jun transcription.",

        "abstract": "A decrease in the bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) is linked to hypercholesterolemia. However, the mechanism by which low density lipoprotein (LDL) mediates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) dysfunction remains controversial. We investigate the effect of LDL on eNOS regulation in human endothelial cells (ECs). In cultured ECs, a high level of LDL increased the abundance of eNOS and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in the membrane caveolae and the association of eNOS with Cav-1. Furthermore, it decreased the basal level of NO and blocked NO production stimulated by the calcium ionophore A23187. LDL exposure also increased the formation of stress fibers and the membrane translocation of eNOS. These effects can be blocked by cytochalasin D, an actin cytoskeleton disruptor. In revealing the mechanism underlying the translocation of eNOS, we found that a high level of LDL increased the level of membrane-associated and GTP-formed RhoA and activated the RhoA downstream kinase ROCK-1 activity. Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK-1, blocked LDL-induced stress fiber formation, eNOS translocation and NO production. In conclusion, a high level of LDL increases the movement of eNOS to membrane caveolae via the increased stress fibers. The RhoA-mediated pathway may play a crucial role in this process in vascular ECs.",

We previously reported that LDL activates c-Jun and AP-1 in ECs. In this study, we demonstrated that p38-ATF-2 is activated by LDL in human ECs and that this activation is mediated by Ras. When ECs are incubated with LDL in pathophysiological concentrations, the p38-mediated ATF-2 phosphorylation and ATF-2 transactivation are increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. To elucidate the upstream mechanism in LDL-activated p38 in ECs, we demonstrate that LDL increases Ras translocation from the cytoplasm to the cellular membrane, with concurrent increases in Ras binding activity to GST-Raf-1. Overexpression of RasN17, a dominant negative mutant of Ras, attenuates the LDL-induced increases in (1) phosphorylation of ATF-2, (2) phosphorylation of c-Jun, (3) AP-1 binding, and (4) AP-1-driven luciferase activity. To study the effect of p38 in the regulation of an LDL targeting gene, we show that a specific p38 inhibitor attenuates LDL-induced E-selectin at the mRNA level. Thus, LDL activates both p38 and JNK signaling pathways through Ras activation, and furthermore, these events may play an important role in LDL-induced endothelial activation.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate the upstream signaling mechanisms mediating LDL activation of c-Jun/AP-1. Using a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activity assay, we have detected an increase in JNK activity in LDL-exposed HUVEC, which started at 15 min and reached maximum activity after 1-2 h. This JNK activity, increased by LDL, occurred in a dose-dependent fashion starting at a concentration of 80 mg/dl of LDL and reaching maximum activation at a concentration of 160-240 mg/dl. Following cotransfection, the increase of AP-1 driven luciferase activity by LDL was attenuated 54% by a kinase-deficient JNK1. Furthermore, a specific trans-reporting system was utilized to confirm c-Jun activation by upstream signal mechanisms. The results show c-Jun activity increased by 3-fold after LDL exposure when compared with respective controls. In contrast, LDL exposure did not affect the activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), even though phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment remarkably increased the activity of these kinases. Thus, this study demonstrates, for the first time, that JNK mediates LDL-induced endothelial cell activation.",

This resulted in a high steady-state caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. LDL exposure appeared not to regulate the abundance of Cav-1. Immunofluorescence staining showed that Cav-1 protein migrated from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane after LDL exposure. Cav-1 protein and cholesterol partitioned mainly into the caveola fractions, and LDL increased both Cav-1 and cholesterol in these fractions. Ras protein in caveola fractions was also increased by LDL. Increased Ras was detected in Cav-1 immunoprecipitated samples, and conversely, increased Cav-1 was found in Ras-immunoprecipitated samples. We also demonstrated LDL-increased Ras activity in HUVECs by measuring the GTP/GTP+GDP ratio of Ras with [(32)P]orthophosphate labeling in the cells. Finally, we determined the binding of [(3)H]-labeled free cholesterol and recombinant H-Ras to Cav-1 fusion proteins in vitro. Both cholesterol and Ras bound to full-length GST-Cav-1, scaffolding domain (61-101), and C-terminal (135-178) Cav-1 fusion peptides. Addition of cholesterol enhanced Ras binding to the full-length and scaffolding domain of Cav-1 but not to the C-terminal Cav-1. These findings strongly suggest a role for Cav-1 in cholesterol trafficking and cholesterol-mediated intracellular signaling, which may mediate EC activation by LDL.",

        "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a critical role in ensuring proper folding of newly synthesized proteins. Aberrant ER stress is reported to play a causal role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the effects of ER stress on vascular smooth muscle contractility and blood pressure remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether aberrant ER stress causes abnormal vasoconstriction and consequent high blood pressure in mice.ER stress markers, vascular smooth muscle contractility, and blood pressure were monitored in mice. Incubation of isolated aortic rings with tunicamycin or MG132, 2 structurally unrelated ER stress inducers, significantly increased both phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction and the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (Thr18/Ser19), both of which were abrogated by pretreatment with chemical chaperones or 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide and metformin, 2 potent activators for the AMP-activated protein kinase. Consistently, administration of tauroursodeoxycholic acid or 4-phenyl butyric acid, 2 structurally unrelated chemical chaperones, in AMP-activated protein kinase-\u03b12 knockout mice lowered blood pressure and abolished abnormal vasoconstrictor response of AMP-activated protein kinase-\u03b12 knockout mice to phenylephrine. Consistently, tunicamycin (0.01 \u03bcg/g per day) infusion markedly increased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both of which were ablated by coadministration of 4-phenyl butyric acid. Furthermore, 4-phenyl butyric acid or tauroursodeoxycholic acid, which suppressed angiotensin II infusion-induced ER stress markers in vivo, markedly lowered blood pressure in angiotensin II-infused mice in vivo.We conclude that ER stress increases vascular smooth muscle contractility resulting in high blood pressure, and AMP-activated protein kinase activation mitigates high blood pressure through the suppression of ER stress in vivo.",

The aims of the present study were to determine the contributions of NF-kB activation to TPr-triggered vascular inflammation and elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying TPr activation of NF-kB. Approach and Results-The effects of TPr activators, [1S-[1alpha,2alpha(Z),3beta(1E,3S), 4alpha]]-7-[3-[3-hydroxy-4- (4-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept- 2-yl]-5-heptenoic acid (I-BOP) and U46619, on NF-kB activation, phosphorylation of rhoA/rho-Associated kinases and liver kinase B1, cell adhesion and migration, proliferation, and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation were assayed in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human monocytes, or isolated mouse aortas. Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to TPr agonists I-BOP and U46619 induced dose-dependent and time-dependent phosphorylation of inhibitor of kB a in parallel with aberrant expression of inflammatory markers cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Inhibition of NF-kB by pharmacological or genetic means abolished TPr-triggered expression of inflammatory markers. Consistently, exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to either I-BOP or U46619 significantly increased phosphorylation of inhibitor of kB a, IkappaB kinase, rhoA, rho-Associated kinases, and liver kinase B1. Pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with the TPr antagonist SQ29548 or rho-Associated kinases inhibitor Y27632 or silencing of the LKB1 blocked TPr-enhanced phosphorylation of inhibitor of kB a and its upstream kinase, IkappaB kinase. Finally, exposure of isolated mouse aortas to either U46619 or I-BOP enhanced NF-kB activation and vascular inflammation in parallel with reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in intact vessels. Conclusions-TPr stimulation instigates aberrant inflammation and endothelial dysfunction via rhoassociated kinases/liver kinase B1/IkappaB kinase-dependent NF-kB activation in vascular endothelial cells. \u00a9 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Redox state is a critical determinant of cell function, and any major imbalances can cause severe damage or death.The aim of this study is to determine if AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor, is activated by oxidants generated by Berberine in endothelial cells (EC).Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were exposed to Berberine. AMPK activity and reactive oxygen species were monitored after the incubation.In BAEC, Berberine caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) at Ser79, a well characterized downstream target of AMPK. Concomitantly, Berberine increased peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant formed by simultaneous generation of superoxide and nitric oxide. Pre-incubation of BAEC with anti-oxidants markedly attenuated Berberine-enhanced phosphorylation of both AMPK and ACC. Consistently, adenoviral expression of superoxide dismutase and pretreatment of L-N(G)-Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME; a non-selective NOS inhibitor) blunted Berberine-induced phosphorylation of AMPK. Furthermore, mitochondria-targeted tempol (mito-tempol) pretreatment or expression of uncoupling protein attenuated AMPK activation caused by Berberine. Depletion of mitochondria abolished the effects of Berberine on AMPK in EC. Finally, Berberine significantly increased the phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser307 and gene silencing of LKB1 attenuated Berberine-enhanced AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation in BAEC.Our results suggest that mitochondria-derived superoxide anions and peroxynitrite are required for Berberine-induced AMPK activation in endothelial cells.",

        "abstract": "Berberine, a botanical alkaloid purified from Coptidis rhizoma, is reported to activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Whether AMPK is required for the protective effects of berberine in cardiovascular diseases remains unknown. This study was designed to determine whether AMPK is required for berberine-induced reduction of oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in vivo.ApoE (ApoE\u207b/\u207b) mice and ApoE\u207b/\u207b/AMPK alpha 2\u207b/\u207b mice that were fed Western diets were treated with berberine for 8 weeks. Atherosclerotic aortic lesions, expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and markers of oxidative stress were evaluated in isolated aortas.In ApoE\u207b/\u207b mice, chronic administration of berberine significantly reduced aortic lesions, markedly reduced oxidative stress and expression of adhesion molecules in aorta, and significantly increased UCP2 levels. In contrast, in ApoE\u207b/\u207b/AMPK alpha 2\u207b/\u207b mice, berberine had little effect on those endpoints. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), berberine significantly increased UCP2 mRNA and protein expression in an AMPK-dependent manner. Transfection of HUVECs with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1)-specific siRNA attenuated berberine-induced expression of UCP2, whereas transfection with control siRNA did not. Finally, berberine promoted mitochondrial biogenesis that contributed to up-regulation of UCP2 expression.We conclude that berberine reduces oxidative stress and vascular inflammation, and suppresses atherogenesis via a mechanism that includes stimulation of AMPK-dependent UCP2 expression.",

AMPK inhibition with pharmacological inhibitor (compound C) or genetic means (transfection of AMPK\u03b1-specific small interfering RNA) significantly lowered the tube formation in human umbilical vein ECs. Consistently, compared with WT mice, tube formation in MAECs isolated from either AMPK\u03b11(-/-) or AMPK\u03b12(-/-) mice, which exhibited oxidative stress and reduced expression of UCP2, was significantly impaired. In addition, adenoviral overexpression of UCP2, but not adenoviruses encoding green fluorescent protein, normalized tube formation in MAECs from either AMPK\u03b11(-/-) or AMPK\u03b12(-/-) mice. Similarly, supplementation with sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide (NO) donor, restored tube formation. Furthermore, ischemia significantly increased angiogenesis, serine 1177 phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase, and UCP2 in ischemic thigh adductor muscles from WT mice but not in those from either AMPK\u03b11(-/-) or AMPK\u03b12(-/-) mice.We conclude that AMPK-dependent UCP2 expression in ECs promotes angiogenesis in vivo.",

        "abstract": "In a previous study, we found that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) could be induced by proinflammatory factor IL-1beta in A549 human type II alveolar (AEII) epithelial cells. We investigated the mechanism of IL-1beta-induced CGRP secretion and found that the PKC-p38 MAPK-NF-kappaB pathway was involved. In the present study, we found that IL-1beta stimulation induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity within 15min in A549 cells. In investigating whether JNK was involved in IL-1beta-induced CGRP secretion, the JNK II inhibitor SP600125 was used and it significantly attenuated IL-1beta-induced CGRP secretion and c-Jun activity, which was elevated after IL-1beta stimulation from mRNA to protein level. EMSA results showed the activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) after 2-h IL-1beta stimulation, and the JNK II inhibitor blocked c-Jun and AP-1 activity. Bioinformatic analysis showed five predicted AP-1 binding sites on the promoter of beta-CGRP; deletion analysis identified an AP-1 consensus site at -643bp relative to the initiation site, which mediates the beta-CGRP gene transcription in response to IL-1beta. These data suggest that besides the PKC-p38 MAPK-NF-kappaB pathway, the JNK-AP-1 pathway is involved in IL-1beta-induced CGRP secretion in A549 human type II alveolar epithelial cells, and a 643-bp site upstream of the transcription start site on the promoter of beta-CGRP is the AP-1 response element.",

However, the signaling pathways are not well understood. By use of high-throughput, two-dimensional electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry, we found that short-term hypoxic treatment upregulated calreticulin (CRT), an endoplasmic-reticulum stress protein, in A549 human type II alveolar epithelial cells. Genetic manipulation of CRT expression in A549 cells through small interferring RNA inhibition or overexpression demonstrated a positive correlation between CRT expression level and cell viability in subsequent prolonged hypoxia, which indicates that CRT is a key mediator of short-term hypoxia-induced cell protection. Importantly, CRT overexpression prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation during prolonged hypoxia by inducing the expression of thioredoxin (TRX), an antioxidant, in A549 cells. Furthermore, CRT promoted the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2, the transcription factor of TRX. Finally, overexpressing an inactive TRX mutant reversed the effects of CRT on ROS accumulation and cell protection. Our results demonstrate that CRT stimulates the anti-oxidant pathway and contributes to short-term hypoxia-induced protection in A549 type II alveolar epithelial cells, which may have potential therapeutic ramifications for hypoxic pulmonary diseases.",

        "abstract": "Homocysteine (Hcy) has recently been recognized as an integral component of several disorders. However, the association between hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and pulmonary disease is not well understood. The combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry detected and identified proteins that are differentially expressed in human type II alveolar epithelial cells (A549 cells) treated by Hcy. We found that aldose reductase (AR) showed more abundant expression in the cells. Further, Hcy (100-500microM) could induce a time- and dose-dependent upregulation of AR protein levels. Immunohistochemical staining of cross-sections from HHcy mice lungs also revealed increased expression of AR protein. Intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were remarkably elevated in A549 cells treated with Hcy. Pretreatment of A549 cells with catalase and SOD significantly suppressed the Hcy-induced AR expression, which suggests the involvement of ROS in this process. The major signaling pathway mediating the upregulation of AR was demonstrated to be the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway. In addition, Hcy might reduce surfactant protein B (SP-B) expression in the cells, which could be significantly attenuated by Alrestatin, an AR inhibitor, indicating a damaging role of Hcy-induced AR elevation in the lung. These results show a novel and unanticipated link between HHcy and AR upregulation that may be a risk factor in pulmonary disease of patients with HHcy.",

        "abstract": "As important multifunctional cells in the lung, alveolar epithelial type II (AEII) cells secrete numerous chemokines on various stimuli. Our previous data showed that AEII cells also express the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and the proinflammatory factor interleukin (IL)-1beta induces CGRP secretion in the A549 human AEII cell line. In the present study, the CGRP-1 receptor antagonist human (h)CGRP(8-37) (0.1-1 nM) greatly amplified the production of IL-1beta-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. The inhibition of CGRP expression by small interfering RNA significantly increased MCP-1 secretion on IL-1beta stimulation. However, exogenous hCGRP (10-100 nM) suppressed IL-1beta-evoked MCP-1 secretion in MCP-1 promoter activity, and CGRP gene stably transfected cell clones significantly inhibited both the mRNA and protein levels of MCP-1 induced by IL-1beta. These data imply that AEII-derived CGRP suppressed IL-1beta-induced MCP-1 secretion in an autocrine/paracrine mode. Subsequent investigation revealed that CGRP inhibited IL-1beta-evoked NF-kappaB activity by suppressing IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation. Moreover, CGRP attenuated IL-1beta-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, the early event in proinflammatory factor signaling. We previously showed that the CGRP inhibitory effect was mediated by elevated intracellular cAMP and show here that analogs of cAMP, 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate and the Sp isomer of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate, mimicked the CGRP suppressive effect on IL-1beta-induced ROS formation, NF-kappaB activation, and MCP-1 secretion. Thus increased endogenous CGRP secretion in lung inflammatory disease might eliminate the excessive response by elevating the cAMP level through inhibiting the ROS-NF-kappaB-MCP-1 pathway.",

        "abstract": "c-Cbl, a ubiquitously expressed protooncogene, is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to a variety of stimuli, including growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and consequently activates signaling proteins such as phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and Akt. In the present study, we examined the role of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation in vascular injury.Western blotting showed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl was increased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries and in cultured smooth muscle cells on stimulation by PDGF-BB, followed by the activations of Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a c-Cbl mutant that ablates the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites attenuated the Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin activation and decreased the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells in response to PDGF-BB or fibroblast growth factor. These effects could be reversed by constitutively active PI3K or Akt, suggesting that c-Cbl phosphorylation promotes the PDGF-BB-induced proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells through the PI3K/Akt pathways. In addition, overexpression of c-Cbl-m increased the ubiquitination of the PDGF and fibroblast growth factor receptors. Importantly, in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries, local delivery of c-Cbl-m reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin, inhibited the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and prevented neointimal hyperplasia.Our results demonstrate a novel role of c-Cbl in vascular remodeling after injury and suggest that modulation of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation may be a therapeutic approach to treat vascular neointimal hyperplasia such as restenosis after angioplasty.",

        "abstract": "Primary nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most common forms of chronic liver diseases and is associated with insulin-resistant states such as diabetes and obesity. Recent work has revealed potential implications of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPARdelta) in lipid homeostasis and insulin resistance. In this study, we examined the effect of PPARdelta on sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a pivotal transcription factor controlling lipogenesis in hepatocytes. Treatment with GW0742, the PPARdelta agonist, or overexpression of PPARdelta markedly reduced intracellular lipid accumulation. GW0742 and PPARdelta overexpression in hepatocytes induced the expression of insulin-induced gene-1 (Insig-1), an endoplasmic reticulum protein braking SREBP activation, at both the mRNA and the protein levels. PPARdelta inhibited the proteolytic processing of SREBP-1 into the mature active form, thereby suppressing the expression of the lipogenic genes fatty acid synthase, stearyl CoA desaturase-1, and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase. Our results revealed a direct binding of PPARdelta to a noncanonical peroxisome proliferator responsive element motif upstream of the transcription initiation site of human Insig-1. The disruption of this site diminished the induction of Insig-1, which suggested that Insig-1 is a direct PPARdelta target gene in hepatocytes. Knockdown of endogenous Insig-1 attenuated the suppressive effect of GW0742 on SREBP-1 and its target genes, indicating PPARdelta inhibited SREBP-1 activation via induction of Insig-1. Furthermore, overexpression of PPARdelta by intravenous infection with the PPARdelta adenovirus induced the expression of Insig-1, suppressed SREBP-1 activation, and, consequently, ameliorated hepatic steatosis in obese db/db mice.Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which PPARdelta regulates lipogenesis, suggesting potential therapeutic applications of PPARdelta modulators in obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as related steatotic liver diseases.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE - Endothelial activation is implicated in atherogenesis and diabetes. The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b4 (PPAR-\u03b4) in endothelial activation remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of PPAR-\u03b4 and the mechanism involved. METHODS AND RESULTS - In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the synthetic PPAR-\u03b4 ligands GW0742 and GW501516 significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin (assayed by real-time RT-PCR and Northern blotting), as well as the ensuing endothelial-leukocyte adhesion. Activation of PPAR-\u03b4 upregulated the expression of antioxidant genes superoxide dismutase 1, catalase, and thioredoxin and decreased reactive oxygen species production in ECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that GW0742 switched the association of BCL-6, a transcription repressor, from PPAR-\u03b4 to the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 promoter. Small interfering RNA reduced endogenous PPAR-\u03b4 expression but potentiated the suppressive effect of GW0742 on EC activation, which suggests that the nonliganded PPAR-\u03b4 may have an opposite effect. CONCLUSIONS - We have demonstrated that ligand activation of PPAR-\u03b4 in ECs has a potent antiinflammatory effect, probably via a binary mechanism involving the induction of antioxidative genes and the release of nuclear corepressors. PPAR-\u03b4 agonists may have a potential for treating inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes. \u00a9 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.",

The role of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK)\u03b2 in flow induction of SIRT1 both in vitro and in vivo was investigated. Pulsatile shear stress mimicking atheroprotective flow increased the level of SIRT1 in cultured ECs by enhancing its stability, and this effect was abolished by inhibition or knockdown of CaMKK\u03b2. Flow-enhanced SIRT1 stability was primarily mediated by CaMKK\u03b2 phosphorylation of SIRT1 at Ser-27 and Ser-47, as evidenced by in vitro kinase assay, mass spectrometry, and experiments using loss- or gain-of-function SIRT1 mutants. Flow-induced CaMKK\u03b2 phosphorylation of SIRT1 Ser-27 and Ser-47 increased antioxidative and anti-inflammatory capacities. Ablation of CaMKK\u03b2 or SIRT1 in mice with an apolipoprotein E-null background showed increased atherosclerosis both in athero-prone and in athero-protective areas. The results suggest that the CaMKK\u03b2-SIRT1 axis in ECs is mechanosensitive, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory.",

In this study, we investigate the role of lipid rafts and integrin \u03b15 in regulating the inflammatory response in endothelial cells (ECs) under atheroprone versus atheroprotective flow. Lipid raft proteins were isolated from ECs exposed to oscillatory shear stress (OS) or pulsatile shear stress, and then analyzed by quantitative proteomics. Among 396 proteins redistributed in lipid rafts, integrin \u03b15 was the most significantly elevated in lipid rafts under OS. In addition, OS increased the level of activated integrin \u03b15 in lipid rafts through the regulation of membrane cholesterol and fluidity. Disruption of F-actin-based cytoskeleton and knockdown of caveolin-1 prevented the OS-induced integrin \u03b15 translocation and activation. In vivo, integrin \u03b15 activation and EC dysfunction were observed in the atheroprone areas of low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr\u2212/\u2212) mice, and knockdown of integrin \u03b15 markedly attenuated EC dysfunction in partially ligated carotid arteries. Consistent with these findings, mice with haploinsufficency of integrin \u03b15 exhibited a reduction of atherosclerotic lesions in the regions under atheroprone flow. The present study has revealed an integrin- and membrane lipid raft-dependent mechanotransduction mechanism by which atheroprone flow causes endothelial dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. We have previously shown that homocysteine can induce monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) secretion via reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human monocytes in vitro. In the present study, we investigated whether redox factor-1 (Ref-1) is involved in HHcy-accelerated atherosclerosis. We used a mild HHcy animal model, aortic roots and peritoneal macrophages were isolated for immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, from apoE-/- and C57BL/6J mice fed a high Hcy diet (1.8 g/L) for 4 or 12 weeks. Four-week HHcy apoE-/- mice showed more plaques and significantly increased immunostaining of Ref-1 and MCP-1 in foam cells, and HHcy mice showed enhanced Ref-1 expression in peritoneal macrophages. To explore the mediating mechanism, incubation with Hcy (100 microM) increased Ref-1 protein level and translocation in human monocytes in vitro. In addition, Hcy-induced NADPH oxidase activity mediated the upregulation of Ref-1. Furthermore, overexpressed Ref-1 upregulated NF-kappaB and MCP-1 promoter activity, and antisense Ref-1 reduced Hcy-induced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and MCP-1 secretion. These data indicate that Hcy-induced ROS upregulate the expression and translocation of Ref-1 via NADPH oxidase, and then Ref-1 increases NF-kappaB activity and MCP-1 secretion in human monocytes/macrophages, which may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "AimsVascular calcification (VC) is highly associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Paracrine/autocrine factors such as vasoactive peptides are involved in VC development. Here, we investigated the expression of the novel peptide intermedin (IMD) in the vasculature, tested its ability to prevent VC in vivo and in vitro, and examined the mechanism involved.Methods and resultsRat VC was induced by administration of vitamin D3 plus nicotine (VDN). IMD (100 ng kg -1 h-1) was systemically administered by a mini-osmotic pump. VDN-treated rat aortas showed lower IMD content and increased expression of its receptors, along with increased vascular calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Low IMD levels were accompanied by increased calcium deposition in human atherosclerotic plaques. In vivo administration of IMD greatly reduced vascular calcium deposition and ALP activity in VDN-treated rats when compared with vehicle treatment, which was further confirmed in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Concurrently, the loss of smooth-muscle lineage markers and matrix-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) protein (cMGP) in aortas was ameliorated by administering IMD to rats with VC, and the increased phosphor-Smad1/5/8 and core binding factor \u03b1-1 levels in calcified vasculature were also reduced. However, the inhibitory effects of IMD on VC were eliminated upon pre-treatment with warfarin or small interfering RNA to reduce cMGP.ConclusionReduced endogenous IMD levels are associated with increased mineralization in vivo, and administration of IMD inhibits VC development by increasing cMGP levels. IMD may be an endogenous vasoprotective factor for VC.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) signaling by nitric oxide (NO) in isolated rat aortas and cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Both administration of H(2)S and NaHS, as well as endogenous H(2)S, reduced NO formation, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, eNOS transcript abundance, and l-arginine (l-Arg) transport (all P < 0.01). The kinetics analysis of eNOS activity and l-Arg transport showed that H(2)S reduced V(max) values (all P < 0.01) without modifying K(m) parameters. Use of selective NOS inhibitors verified that eNOS [vs. inducible NOS (iNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS)] was the specific target of H(2)S regulation. H(2)S treatment (100 micromol/l) reduced Akt phosphorylation and decreased eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177. H(2)S reduced l-Arg uptake by inhibition of a system y+ transporter and decreased the CAT-1 transcript. H(2)S treatment reduced protein expression of eNOS but not of nNOS and iNOS. Pinacidil (K(ATP) channel opener) exhibited the similar inhibitory effects on the l-Arg/NOS/NO pathway. Glibenclamide (K(ATP) channel inhibitor) partly blocked the inhibitory effect of H(2)S and pinacidil. An in vivo experiment revealed that H(2)S downregulated the vascular l-Arg/eNOS/NO pathway after intraperitoneal injection of NaHS (14 micromol/kg) in rats. Taken together, our findings suggest that H(2)S downregulates the vascular l-Arg/NOS/NO pathway in vitro and in vivo, and the K(ATP) channel could be involved in the regulatory mechanism of H(2)S.",

        "abstract": "Intermedin, a novel member of calcitonin gene-related peptide family, is an endogenous cardiovascular-protective peptide. Because intermedin exists in human atherosclerotic plaque, we studied the role of intermedin in macrophage scavenger receptor A (SR-A)-mediated foam-cell formation and atherogenesis. In an in vitro foam-cell formation model (induced by acetylated low-density lipoprotein [AcLDL]) with mouse (C57BL/6J) macrophages, intermedin reduced AcLDL uptake and binding, decreased intracellular cholesterol content, and suppressed both mRNA and protein levels of SR-A. Simultaneously, intermedin increased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein levels by increasing PTEN phosphorylation and inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated PTEN degradation. These effects were blocked by the intermedin receptor antagonist or cAMP-protein kinase A inhibitors. PTEN overexpression mimicked the inhibitory effects of intermedin on SR-A expression and AcLDL uptake. However, knockdown of PTEN by short-hairpin RNA completely blocked all inhibitory effects of intermedin. Furthermore, in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice, 6-week intermedin infusion reduced AcLDL uptake and SR-A mRNA and protein levels and increased PTEN protein level in peritoneal macrophages. PTEN level was increased and SR-A expression decreased in parallel in macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, intermedin inhibited atherosclerosis in apoE(-/-) mice. Increased stability of PTEN by intermedin leads to SR-A inhibition in macrophages, which ameliorates foam-cell formation and atherosclerosis in apoE(-/-) mice.",

        "abstract": "Our previous work reported that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-mediated apoptosis was activated during vascular calcification (VC). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a critical transcription factor in osteoblastogenesis and ERS-induced apoptosis. However, whether ATF4 is involved in ERS-mediated apoptosis contributing to VC remains unclear. In the present study, in vivo VC was induced in rats by administering vitamin D3 plus nicotine. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification in vitro was induced by incubation in calcifying media containing \u03b2-glycerophosphate and CaCl2. ERS inhibitors taurine or 4-phenylbutyric acid attenuated ERS and VSMC apoptosis in calcified rat arteries, reduced calcification and retarded the VSMC contractile phenotype transforming into an osteoblast-like phenotype in vivo. Inhibition of ERS retarded the VSMC phenotypic transition into an osteoblast-like cell phenotype and reduced VSMC calcification and apoptosis in vitro. Interestingly, ATF4 was activated in calcified aortas and calcified VSMCs in vitro. ATF4 knockdown attenuated ERS-induced apoptosis in calcified VSMCs. ATF4 deficiency blocked VSMC calcification and negatively regulated the osteoblast phenotypic transition of VSMCs in vitro. Our results demonstrate that ATF4 was involved at least in part in the process of ERS-mediated apoptosis contributing to VC.",

        "abstract": "We previously reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis participated in vascular calcification. Importantly, a novel paracrine/autocrine peptide intermedin1-53 (IMD1-53) in the vasculature inhibited vascular calcification in rats. But the mechanisms needed to be fully elucidated. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) calcification was induced by CaCl2 and \u03b2-glycerophosphate. Tunicamycin (Tm) or dithiothreitol (DTT) was used to induce ER stress. We found that IMD1-53 (10(-7)mol/L) treatment significantly alleviated the protein expression of ER stress hallmarks activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), ATF6, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP94 induced by Tm or DTT. ER stress occurred in early and late calcification of VSMCs but was inhibited by IMD1-53. These inhibitory effects of IMD1-53 were abolished by treatment with the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89. Pretreatment with IMD1-53 decreased the number of apoptotic VSMCs and downregulated protein expression of cleaved caspase 12 and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in calcified VSMCs. Concurrently, IMD1-53 restored the loss of VSMC lineage markers and ameliorated calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity in calcified VSMCs as well. The observation was further verified by Alizarin Red S staining, which showed that IMD1-53 reduced positive red nodules among calcified VSMCs. In conclusion, IMD1-53 attenuated VSMC calcification by inhibiting ER stress through cAMP/PKA signalling.",

        "abstract": "CD36-mediated uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) plays a pivotal role in macrophage foam-cell formation and atherogenesis. Previously we reported on intermedin (IMD), a novel member of the calcitonin gene-related peptide family, in atherosclerotic plaque reducing atherogenesis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice. Here, we studied the role of IMD in CD36-mediated macrophage foam-cell formation.In apoE(-/-) mice, 6-week IMD infusion reduced oxLDL uptake, intracellular cholesterol content, and foam-cell formation in peritoneal macrophages and reduced protein and mRNA levels of CD36. These in vivo results agreed with in vitro observations in primary peritoneal macrophages. Reduced CD36 protein and mRNA levels were due to an IMD-accelerated decay of CD36 mRNA. Tristetraprolin (TTP), which binds to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA and promotes its degradation, mediated CD36 mRNA destabilization. TTP knockdown by short-hairpin RNA increased and TTP overexpression reduced CD36 expression, and TTP knockdown rescued IMD-reduced CD36 expression. Moreover, IMD repressed TTP phosphorylation, thereby activating TTP, for increased TTP binding to the 3'-UTR of CD36 mRNA.Thus, IMD attenuates macrophage foam-cell formation via TTP-mediated degradation of CD36 mRNA. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of the anti-atherogenic role of IMD and a novel pattern for regulation of CD36 expression in macrophages.",

Since intermedin (IMD) 1\u201353  (a\u00a0calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide) protects against vascular calcification, we studied whether IMD 1\u201353  inhibits vascular calcification by upregulating \u03b1-Klotho. A\u00a0rat model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with vascular calcification induced by the 5/6 nephrectomy plus vitamin D 3  was used for study. The aortas of rats with CKD showed reduced IMD content but an increase of its receptor, calcitonin receptor-like receptor, and its receptor modifier, receptor activity-modifying protein 3. IMD 1\u201353  treatment reduced vascular calcification. The expression of \u03b1-Klotho was greatly decreased in the aortas of rats with CKD but increased in the aortas of IMD 1\u201353 -treated rats with CKD.  In\u00a0vitro , IMD 1\u201353  increased \u03b1-Klotho protein level in calcified vascular smooth muscle cells. \u03b1-Klotho knockdown blocked the inhibitory effect of IMD 1\u201353  on vascular smooth muscle cell calcification and their transformation into osteoblast-like cells. The effect of IMD 1\u201353  to upregulate \u03b1-Klotho and inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell calcification was abolished by knockdown of its receptor or its modifier protein, or treatment with the protein kinase A inhibitor H89. Thus, IMD 1\u201353  may attenuate vascular calcification by upregulating \u03b1-Klotho via the calcitonin receptor/modifying protein complex and protein kinase A signaling.",

        "abstract": "We report here on the clinical, genetic, and molecular characterization of three Han Chinese pedigrees with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing loss. Clinical evaluation revealed the variable phenotype of hearing impairment including severity, age-at-onset, audiometric configuration in these subjects. The penetrance of hearing loss in WZD8, WZD9, and WZD10 pedigrees were 46%, 46%, and 50%, respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced deafness was included. When the effect of aminoglycosides was excluded, the penetrance of hearing loss in these pedigrees were 23%, 31%, and 37.5%, respectively. Mutational analysis of the complete mitochondrial genomes showed the homoplasmic A1555G mutation and distinct sets of mitochondrial DNA variants belonging to haplogroups D4b2b, B5b1, and F2, respectively. Of these, the tRNACys T5802C, tRNA Thr A15924C, and ND5 T12338C variants are of special interest as these variants occur at positions which are highly evolutionarily conserved nucleotides of tRNAs or amino acid of polypeptide. These homoplasmic mtDNA variants were absent among 156 unrelated Chinese controls. The T5802C and G15927A variants disrupted a highly conserved A-U or C-G base-pairing at the anticodon-stem of tRNACys or tRNAThr, while the ND5 T12338C mutation resulted in the replacement of the translation-initiating methionine with a threonine, and also located in two nucleotides adjacent to the 3\u2032 end of the tRNALeu(CUN). Thus, mitochondrial dysfunctions, caused by the A1555G mutation, would be worsened by these mtDNA variants. Therefore, these mtDNA mutations may have a potential modifier role in increasing the penetrance and expressivity of the deafness-associated 12S rRNA A1555G mutation in those Chinese pedigrees. \u00a9 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "In this report, we investigated the frequency and spectrum of mitochondrial 12S rRNA variants in a large cohort of 1642 Han Chinese pediatric subjects with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing loss. Mutational analysis of 12S rRNA gene in these subjects identified 68 (54 known and 14 novel) variants. The frequencies of known 1555A>G and 1494C>T mutations were 3.96% and 0.18%, respectively, in this cohort with nonsyndromic and aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Prevalence of other putative deafness-associated mutation at positions 1095 and 961 were 0.61% and 1.7% in this cohort, respectively. Furthermore, the 745A>G, 792C>T, 801A>G, 839A>G, 856A>G, 1027A>G, 1192C>T, 1192C>A, 1310C>T, 1331A>G, 1374A>G and 1452T>C variants conferred increased sensitivity to ototoxic drugs or nonsyndromic deafness as they were absent in 449 Chinese controls and localized at highly conserved nucleotides of this rRNA. However, other variants appeared to be polymorphisms. Moreover, 65 Chinese subjects carrying the 1555A>G mutation exhibited bilateral and sensorineural hearing loss. A wide range of severity, age-of-onset and audiometric configuration was observed among these subjects. In particular, the sloping and flat-shaped patterns were the common audiograms in individuals carrying the 1555A>G mutation. The phenotypic variability in subjects carrying these 12S rRNA mutations indicated the involvement of nuclear modifier genes, mitochondrial haplotypes, epigenetic and environmental factors in the phenotypic manifestation of these mutations. Therefore, our data demonstrated that mitochondrial 12S rRNA is the hot spot for mutations associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the role of mitochondrial modifiers in the development of deafness associated with 12S rRNA A1555G mutation.Four Chinese families with nonsyndromic and aminoglycoside-induced deafness were studied by clinical and genetic evaluation, molecular and biochemical analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).These families exhibited high penetrance and expressivity of hearing impairment. Penetrances of hearing loss in WZD31, WZD32, WZD33, and WZD34 pedigrees ranged from 50 to 67% and from 39 to 50%, respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss was included or excluded. Matrilineal relatives in these families developed hearing loss at the average of 14, 13, 16, and 15 years of age, respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced deafness was excluded. Mutational analysis of entire mtDNA in these families showed the homoplasmic A1555G mutation and distinct sets of variants belonging to haplogroup B5b1. Of these, the tRNA G15927A mutation locates at the fourth base in the anticodon stem (conventional position 42) of tRNA. A guanine (G42) at this position of tRNA is highly conserved from bacteria to human mitochondria. The lower levels and altered electrophoretic mobility of tRNA were observed in cells carrying A1555G and G15927A mutations or only G15927A mutation but not cells carrying only A1555G mutation. The abolished base pairing (28C-42G) of this tRNA by the G15927A mutation caused a failure in tRNA metabolism, worsening the mitochondrial dysfunctions altered by the A1555G mutation.The G15927A mutation has a potential modifier role in increasing the penetrance and expressivity of the deafness-associated 12S rRNA A1555G mutation in those Chinese pedigrees.",

        "abstract": "We report here the clinical, genetic, and molecular characterization of two Chinese families with aminoglycoside induced and non-syndromic hearing impairment. Clinical and genetic evaluations revealed the variable severity and age-of-onset in hearing impairment in these families. Strikingly, there were extremely low penetrances of hearing impairment in these Chinese families. Sequence analysis of the complete mitochondrial genomes in these pedigrees showed the distinct sets of mtDNA polymorphism, in addition to the identical G7444A mutation associated with hearing loss. Indeed, the G7444A mutation in the CO1 gene and the precursor of tRNASer(UCN) gene is present in homoplasmy only in the maternal lineage of those pedigrees but not other members of these families and 164 Chinese controls. Their mitochondrial genomes belong to the Eastern Asian haplogroups C5a and D4a, respectively. In fact, the occurrence of the G7444A mutation in these several genetically unrelated subjects affected by hearing impairment strongly indicates that this mutation is involved in the pathogenesis of hearing impairment. However, there was the absence of other functionally significant mtDNA mutations in two Chinese pedigrees carrying the G7444A mutation. Therefore, nuclear modifier gene(s) or aminoglycoside(s) may play a role in the phenotypic expression of the deafness-associated G7444A mutation in these Chinese pedigrees.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been found to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss. We report here a systematic mutational screening of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene in 128 Chinese pediatric subjects with sporadic aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing loss. We show that aminoglycoside ototoxicity accounts for 48% of cases of hearing loss in this Chinese pediatric population. Of the known deafness-associated mutations in this gene, the incidence of the A1555G mutation is approximately 13% and approximately 2.9% in this Chinese pediatric population with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing loss, respectively. Furthermore, mutations at position 961 in the 12S rRNA gene account for approximately 1.7% and 4.4% of cases of aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing loss in this Chinese clinical population, respectively. The T1095C mutation has been identified in one maternally inherited family with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing loss. However, the C1494T mutation was not detected in this clinical population. In addition, three variants, A827G, T1005C and A1116G, in the 12S rRNA gene, localized at highly conserved sites, may play a role in the pathogenesis of aminoglycoside ototoxicity. These data strongly suggest that the mitochondrial 12S rRNA is a hot-spot for deafness-associated mutations in the Chinese population.",

The penetrance of hearing loss (affected matrilineal relatives/total matrilineal relatives) in this pedigree was 53%, when aminoglycoside-induced deafness was included. When the effect of aminoglycosides was excluded, the penetrance of hearing loss in this pedigree was 42%. These matrilineal relatives exhibited a wide range of severity of hearing loss, varying from profound to normal hearing. Furthermore, these affected matrilineal relatives shared some common features: bilateral hearing loss of high frequencies and symmetries. Sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the pedigree identified the homoplasmic 12S rRNA A1555G mutation and other 35 variants belonging to Eastern Asian haplogroup D4. Of these, the V313I (G11696A) mutation in ND4 was associated with vision loss. However, the extremely low penetrance of visual loss, and the mild biochemical defect and the presence of one/167 Chinese controls indicted that the G11696A mutation is itself not sufficient to produce a clinical phenotype. Thus, the G11696A mutation may act in synergy with the primary deafness-associated 12S rRNA A1555G mutation in this Chinese family, thereby increasing the penetrance and expressivity of hearing loss in this Chinese pedigree.",

        "abstract": "The 1555A>G mutation in mitochondrial 12S rRNA has been associated with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic deafness in many individuals worldwide. Mitochondrial genetic modifiers are proposed to influence the phenotypic expression of m.1555A>G mutation. Here, we report that a deafness-susceptibility allele (m.4317A>G) in the tRNA gene modulates the phenotype expression of m.1555A>G mutation. Strikingly, a large Han Chinese pedigree carrying both m.4317A>G and m.1555A>G mutations exhibited much higher penetrance of deafness than those carrying only m.1555A>G mutation. The m.4317A>G mutation affected a highly conserved adenine at position 59 in the T-loop of tRNA We therefore hypothesized that the m.4317A>G mutation alters both structure and function of tRNA Using lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from members of Chinese families (three carrying both m.1555A>G and m.4317A>G mutations, three harboring only m.1555A>G mutation, and three controls lacking these mutations), we found that the cell lines bearing both m.4317A>G and m.1555A>G mutations exhibited more severe mitochondrial dysfunctions than those carrying only m.1555A>G mutation. We also found that the m.4317A>G mutation perturbed the conformation, stability, and aminoacylation efficiency of tRNA These m.4317A>G mutation-induced alterations in tRNAIle structure and function aggravated the defective mitochondrial translation and respiratory phenotypes associated with m.1555A>G mutation. Furthermore, mutant cell lines bearing both m.4317A>G and m.1555A>G mutations exhibited greater reductions in the mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potentials and increasing production of reactive oxygen species than those carrying only m.1555A>G mutation. Our findings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of maternally inherited deafness arising from the synergy between mitochondrial 12S rRNA and tRNA mutations.",

        "abstract": "Tissue differentiation-inducing non-protein coding RNA (TINCR) is required for normal epidermal differentiation. TINCR is also strongly overexpressed in human gastric cancer (GC) and contributes to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. However, the association between TINCR polymorphisms and the risk of any diseases, such as GC, remains unknown. In the present study, the tag single nucleotide polymorphisms rs8113645, rs2288947, rs8105637, and rs12610531 were analyzed in 602 patients with GC and 602 age- and sex-matched controls. Polymorphisms were genotyped using TaqMan technology. Carriers of variant rs8113645 and rs2288947 alleles indicated reduced risks of GC (p = 0.003 and 0.037, respectively). A allele genotypes of rs8113645 and G allele genotypes of rs2288947 (rs8113645 GA and AA; rs2288947 AG and GG) were also significantly associated with decreased GC risk (p < 0.05). Stratification analysis displayed that the correlations between GC risk and variant genotypes of both rs8113645 and rs2288947were more evident in younger individuals, men, nonsmokers, and individuals from rural areas. We also demonstrated that rs8113645 GA+AA genotype carriers had lower TINCR mRNA expression levels compared with common genotype in both normal and GC tissues (p < 0.05). These results suggest that long non-coding RNA TINCR polymorphisms may be implicated in GC development.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in mitochondrial DNA is one of the important causes of hearing loss. Here, we performed a mutational screening of tRNA(Ser(UCN)) gene in 1542 Chinese subjects with hearing loss. One subject and five subjects carried tRNA(Ser(UCN)) A7445C and G7444A mutations, respectively, while two subjects harbored both G7444A and 12S rRNA A1555G mutations. Clinical evaluation revealed the variable phenotype of bilateral hearing impairment including severity and audiometric configuration in these subjects. Six pedigrees carrying only G7444A or A7445C mutation exhibited extremely low penetrance of hearing loss, while two families carrying both G7444A and A1555G mutations displayed high penetrance of hearing loss. Of 94 matrilineal relatives in these families, eight subjects suffered from aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss, while seven hearing-impaired subjects did not have a history of exposure to aminoglycosides. Those suggest that G7444A and A7445C mutations themselves are insufficient to produce a clinical phenotype and aminoglycosides are the major modifier factors for the development of deafness in these Chinese families. The combination of A1555G and G7444A mutations increased deafness expression. These observations provide an additional evidence for the early diction and prevention of deafness at the high risk populations carrying these mitochondrial DNA mutations.",

However, the incidences of 12S rRNA mutations associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity are less known.A total of 440 Chinese pediatric hearing-impaired subjects were recruited from two otology clinics in the Ningbo and Wenzhou cities of Zhejiang Province, China. These subjects underwent clinical, genetic evaluation and molecular analysis of mitochondrial 12S rRNA. Resultant mtDNA variants were evaluated by structural and phylogenetic analysis.The study samples consisted of 227 males and 213 females. The age of all participants ranged from 1 years old to 18 years, with the median age of 9 years. Ninety-eight subjects (58 males and 40 females) had a history of exposure to aminoglycosides, accounting for 22.3% cases of hearing loss in this cohort. Molecular analysis of 12S rRNA gene identified 41 (39 known and 2 novel) variants. The incidences of the known deafness-associated 1555A > G, 1494C > T and 1095T > C mutations were 7.5%, 0.45% and 0.91% in this entire hearing-impaired subjects, respectively, and 21.4%, 2% and 2% among 98 subjects with aminoglycoside ototoxicity, respectively. The structural and phylogenetic evaluations showed that a novel 747A > G variant and known 839A > G, 1027A > G, 1310C > T and 1413T > C variants conferred increased sensitivity to aminoglycosides or nonsyndromic deafness as they were absent in 449 Chinese controls and localized at highly conserved nucleotides of this rRNA. However, other variants were polymorphisms. Of 44 subjects carrying one of definite or putative deafness-related 12S rRNA variants, only one subject carrying the 1413T > C variant harbored the 235DelC/299DelAT mutations in the GJB2 gene, while none of mutations in GJB2 gene was detected in other 43 subjects.Mutations in mitochondrial 12S rRNA accounted for ~30% cases of aminoglycoside-induced deafness in this cohort. Our data strongly support the idea that the mitochondrial 12S rRNA is the hot spot for mutations associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity. These data have been providing valuable information and technology to predict which individuals are at risk for ototoxicity, to improve the safety of aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy, and eventually to decrease the incidence of deafness.",

        "abstract": "The muscarinic receptor M3 is an acetylcholine receptor that regulates the activity of numerous fundamental central and peripheral nervous system functions. Recent studies have identified the activation of the M3 receptor in several cancers; however, the role of M3 in human gastric cancer (GC) remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the M3 receptor was overexpressed in human GC tissues and was correlated with the cancer stage and with lymph node metastasis. In vitro, the M3 receptor enhanced the proliferation induced by acetylcholine in human GC cells, whereas the knockdown of M3 by a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, M3 knockdown caused G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in human GC cells. In vivo, M3 knockdown suppressed tumorigenesis and promoted apoptosis in GC xenografts. In addition, we also detected the secretion of acetylcholine (ACh) by human GC cells and observed the co-expression of the M3 receptor and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme necessary for acetylcholine synthesis, in human GC tissues and cells. Taken together, our findings support an oncogenic role for the M3 receptor in gastric cancer, suggesting that M3 antagonists may serve as potential adjuvants to GC therapies. Further study of the underlying molecular mechanism could also lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for improved treatment of GC. ",

However, the underlying mechanism of NI in PDAC remains unclear. In this study, we found that MUC4 was overexpressed in PDAC tissues and high expression of MUC4 indicated a higher NI incidence than low expression.  In vitro , MUC4 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of PDAC cells and impaired the migration of PDAC cells along nerve in dorsal root ganglia (DRG)-PDAC cell co-culture assay.  In vivo , MUC4 knockdown suppressed the NI of PDAC cells in a murine NI model. Mechanistically, our data revealed that MUC4 silencing resulted in decreased netrin-1 expression and re-expression of netrin-1 in MUC4-silenced cells rescued the capability of NI. Furthermore, we identified that decreased netrin-1 expression was owed to the downregulation of HER2/AKT/NF-\u03baB pathway in MUC4-silenced cells. Additionally, MUC4 knockdown also resulted in the downregulation of pFAK, pSrc, pJNK and MMP9. Taken together, our findings revealed a novel role of MUC4 in potentiating NI via netrin-1 through the HER2/AKT/NF-\u03baB pathway in PDAC.",

        "abstract": "Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is thought to be a cancer suppresser, as inhibition of PP2A can induce phosphorylation and activation of substrate kinases, most of which can accelerate growth. Interestingly, cantharidin potently inhibits PP2A but efficiently represses various cancer cells. In the present study, we found that PP2A inhibitors, cantharidin or Okadaic acid, inhibited cell viability and triggered apoptosis in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell line dependent on PP2A/IKK\u03b1/I\u03baB\u03b1/p65 NF-\u03baB pathway. The activation of NF-\u03baB pathway up-regulated downstream pro-apoptotic genes, TNF-\u03b1, TRAILR1 and TRAILR2, and triggered apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway, indicating that PP2A is a potential target for pancreatic cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Cantharidin is an active constituent of mylabris, a traditional Chinese medicine. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that plays an important role in control of cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell-fate determination. Owing to its antitumor activity, cantharidin has been frequently used in clinical practice. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of cantharidin in pancreatic cancer. Cantharidin efficiently inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells, but presented a much lighter toxicity effect against normal pancreatic duct cells. It caused G2/M cell-cycle arrest that was accompanied by the down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and up-regulation of p21 expression. It induced apoptosis and elevated the expressions of pro-apoptotic factors tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-related apoptosis inducing receptor 1 (TRAILR1), TRAILR2, Bad, Bak, and Bid, and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 suggested that both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are involved in the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, unlike previous studies on other cancer cells, we found that the inhibitory role of cantharidin is independent of oxidative stress in pancreatic cancer cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including ERK, JNK, and p38, were activated after treatment with cantharidin. Inhibition of JNK, but not ERK or p38, alleviated the cytotoxity effect of cantharidin, suggesting cantharidin exerted its anticancer effect through the JNK-dependent way. Hence, in addition to being an attractive candidate compound with therapeutic potential, cantharidin also highlighted the possibility of using PP2A as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Current therapies are insufficient, making HCC an intractable disease. Our previous studies confirmed that inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer. Unfortunately, constitutive expression of PP2A in normal tissues limits the application of PP2A inhibition. Thus, a HCC-specific gene delivery system should be developed. The \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) promoter is commonly used in HCC-specific gene therapy strategies; however, the utility of this approach is limited due to the weak activity of the AFP promoter. It has been shown that linking the AFP enhancer with the promoter of the non-tissue-specific, human housekeeping phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk) gene can generate a strong and HCC-selective promoter.We constructed a HCC-specific gene therapy system to target PP2A using the AFP enhancer/pgk promoter, and evaluated the efficiency and specificity of this system both in vitro and in vivo.AFP enhancer/pgk promoter-driven expression of the dominant negative form of the PP2A catalytic subunit \u03b1 (DN-PP2Ac\u03b1) exerted cytotoxic effects against an AFP-positive human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B), but did not affect AFP-negative human hepatoma cells (SK-HEP-1) or normal human liver cells (L-02). Moreover, AFP enhancer/pgk promoter driven expression of DN-PP2Ac\u03b1 inhibited the growth of AFP-positive HepG2 tumors in nude mice bearing solid tumor xenografts, but did not affect AFP-negative SK-HEP-1 tumors.The novel approach of AFP enhancer/pgk promoter-driven expression of DN-PP2Ac\u03b1 may provide a useful cancer gene therapy strategy to selectively target HCC.",

The expression of neural related genes (Djnlg, DjFoxD, DjFoxG, DjotxA, and DjotxB) in D. japonica following exposure was determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Immunofluorescence was performed to determine the alterations in neural morphology. In addition, ELISA kits were used to measure level of the neurotransmitters Dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, single cell gel electrophoresis was measured to analyze DNA damage. In this study, PFOS treatment induced neural morphology defects, alterations in neural-related gene expression, alterations in neurotransmitter levels, and DNA damage. However, co-exposure to ANT and PFOS mitigated the damage to D. japonica induced by PFOS. Restoration of neurotransmitter contents and neural related genes expression were observed in planarians following co-application of ANT and PFOS, immunofluorescence showed that nerve morphology almost recovered, and DNA damage was decreased. The results of this study showed that ANT may have a protective effect against PFOS induced neurotoxicity and DNA damage.",

However, the role of MUC4 in angiogenesis and the potential association among these malignant capabilities have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the collective signaling mechanisms associated with MUC4-induced growth, metastasis and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer. Knockdown of MUC4 in two pancreatic cancer cell lines led to downregulation of lysosomal degradation of E-cadherin by Src kinase through downregulation of pFAK and pSrc pathway. The downregulation of lysosomal degradation of E-cadherin in turn induced the formation of E-cadherin/\ufffd\ufffd-catenin complex and membrane translocation of \ufffd\ufffd-catenin, resulting in the downregulation of Wnt/\ufffd\ufffd-catenin signaling pathway. Thus, the Wnt/\ufffd\ufffd-catenin target genes c-Myc, Cyclin D1, CD44 and VEGF were down-regulated and their malignant functions proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis were reduced. Taken together, MUC4-induced nuclear translocation of \ufffd\ufffd-catenin is a novel mechanism for growth, metastasis and angiogenesis of pancreatic cancer. ? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The impacts of boron (B) root application and foliar spray on arsenic (As) uptake, translocation, and efflux by/in rice seedlings ( L.) were investigated in three hydroponic experiments. The addition of B to culture medium did not alter concentrations of arsenite (As[\u2162]), arsenate (As[\u2164]), and total As, nor did it alter transfer coefficients or uptake efficiency of As in rice seedlings under either As(\u2162) or As(\u2164) exposure. Foliar B supply increased shoot B concentrations 15.8-fold, and decreased root As concentrations and As uptake efficiency by 20.9% and 18.0% under As(\u2164) treatment, and by 12.6% and 13.8% under As(\u2162) treatment, respectively, yet did not significantly decrease shoot As concentrations (>0.05). Interestingly, foliar B supply reduced root B concentrations by up to 47.1% under exposure to As(\u2164) but not As(\u2162), and corresponding root B concentrations were 85.3% higher in As(\u2164) treatment than in As(\u2162) treatment on average (<0.05). Both total As and As(\u2164) concentrations were positively related to B concentration in rice roots under As(\u2164) treatment following foliar B supply (<0.05). Rice seedlings extruded 105.2% more As after As(\u2162)-pretreatment than after As(\u2164)-pretreatment. Foliar B supply increased the amount of As excreted by As(\u2162)-pretreated rice root by 14.0%-16.9% (>0.05), and had no effect on the As efflux of As(\u2164)-pretreatment seedlings. A range of 45.9%-70.7% of root As was excreted to solution during one week. These results indicate that the root application of B at four times the concentration of As can slightly decrease As accumulation by rice, whereas foliar B supply is conducive to a decline in As acquisition by rice roots. It is likely that the B channel is at least not the main pathway for As(\u2162) entering into rice roots, and the As(\u2164) distribution mechanism in rice plants may be shared with that of B.",

        "abstract": "Dendritic cell (DC)-based cancer immunotherapy requires an immunogenic tumor associated antigen (TAA) and an effective strategy for its presentation to lymphocytes. Here, we explored whether transduction of DCs with lentiviruses (LVs) expressing a fusion protein of secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC) and mucin 1 (MUC1) could stimulate antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to human cancer cells in vitro.HLA-A2+ peripheral blood monocyte-derived DCs were transduced with recombinant lentiviruses LV at different multiplicities of infection (MOI), and MUC1, SLC or SLC-MUC1 mRNA and protein were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Transduction efficiencies and phenotypes of DCs were evaluated by flow cytometry. Induction of T lymphocyte proliferation by DCs was examined with a Cell Count Kit-8 (CCK-8). CTL activities against tumor cells were analyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays.Stable expression of MUC1, SLC and SLC-MUC1 was obtained in DCs transduced with recombinant LVs, and the transduction efficiencies were dose-dependent. Transduction with LVs did not appreciably change the DC phenotype. CTL induced by LV MUC1 DCs potently and specifically lysed the HLA-A2+, MUC1+colon cancer cell line HCT-116. Moreover, this cytolytic activity against HCT-116 was enhanced with CTL stimulated by LV SLC-MUC1 DCs.DCs transduced with MUC1 could induce effective cytolytic activity against tumor cells in an antigen-specific and HLA-restricted fashion in vitro, and SLC promoted MUC1-specific anti-tumor activity. The transduction of DCs with LV SLC- MUC1 may be a promising strategy in DC-based cancer immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Computations of far-field ship waves, based on linear potential flow theory and the Hogner approximation, are reported for monohull ships and catamarans. Specifically, far-field ship waves are computed for six monohull ships at four Froude numbers     F  \u2261  V  /    g  L    =  0.58  ,     0.68, 0.86, 1.58 and for six catamarans with nondimensional hull spacing     s  \u2261  S  /  L  =  0.25     at two Froude numbers      F  s   \u2261  V  /    g  S    =  1     and 2.5. Here,  g  is the gravitational acceleration,  V  and  L  denote the ship speed and length, and  S  is the separation distance between the twin hulls of a catamaran. The computations show that, although the amplitudes of the waves created by a ship are strongly influenced by the shape of the ship hull, as well known, the ray angles where the largest waves are found are only  weakly  influenced by the hull shape and indeed are mostly a  kinematic  feature of the flow around a ship hull. An important practical consequence of this flow feature is that the apparent wake angle of general monohull ships or catamarans (with arbitrarily-shaped hulls) can be estimated, without computations, by means of simple analytical relations; these relations, obtained elsewhere via parametric computations, are given here. Moreover, the influence of the two parameters  F s   and  s  that largely determine the ray angles of the dominant waves created by a catamaran is illustrated via computations for three catamarans with hull spacings     s  =  0.2  ,     0.35, 0.5 at four Froude numbers      F  s   =  1  ,     1.5, 2, 2.5. These computations confirm that the largest waves created by wide and/or fast catamarans are found at ray angles that only depend on  F s   (i.e. that do not depend on the hull spacing  s ) in agreement with an elementary analysis of lateral interference between the dominant waves created by the bows (or sterns) of the twin hulls of a catamaran. The dominant-waves ray angles predicted by the theory of wave-interference effects for monohull ships and catamarans are also compared with the observations of narrow Kelvin ship wakes reported by Rabaud and Moisy, and found to be consistent with these observations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The farfield waves created by a catamaran with identical twin hulls that advances at constant speed along a straight path in calm water of uniform finite depth are considered. The catamaran is represented as two point sources at the twin bows of the catamaran. This simple approximation of a catamaran as a 2-point wavemaker is realistic for the high-speed regime considered here. Constructive interferences between the divergent waves created by the two point sources result in an apparent wake angle, where the highest waves are found, that can be much narrower than the wake angle associated with the cusps or the asymptotes of the well-known wave patterns radiated from a single point. The farfield wave pattern of a high-speed catamaran can then differ markedly from the wave pattern obtained in the classical analysis of the waves created by a ship modeled as a 1-point wavemaker, in which interference effects are ignored. Moreover, the highest waves created by a catamaran can be much shorter than the waves at the cusps of the wave pattern, and significantly shorter than the ship length. Indeed, the wavelength of the highest waves is equal to the spacing between the twin hulls of the catamaran at high Froude numbers. Wave interferences between the twin bows of a catamaran (dominant at high Froude numbers) are compared to wave interferences between the bow and the stern of a monohull ship or a catamaran (significant at moderate Froude numbers).",

The Green function    G    and its gradient    \u2207  G    are expressed in the usual manner as the sum of three components that correspond to the fundamental free-space singularity, a non-oscillatory local flow, and waves. Simple approximations that only involve elementary continuous functions (algebraic, exponential, logarithmic) of real arguments are given for the local flow components in    G    and    \u2207  G   . These approximations are global approximations valid within the entire flow region, rather than within complementary contiguous regions as can be found in the literature. The analysis of the errors associated with the approximations to the local flow components given in the study shows that the approximations are sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. These global approximations provide a particularly simple and highly efficient way of numerically evaluating the Green function and its gradient for diffraction radiation of time-harmonic waves in deep water.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Neumann\u2013Michell (NM) theory \u2013 a practical linear potential flow theory \u2013 is applied to four freely-floating ship models (Wigley, S60, DTMB5415, KCS), assumed to advance at a constant speed in calm water of large depth, to investigate nonlinear effects on the wave drag, the sinkage, the trim, and the wave profile along the hull, and to approximately account for these effects via simple corrections of the linear theory. Nonlinear effects are found to be relatively small. However, an important exception to this general finding is that the wave drag of a bulbous ship (DTMB5415, KCS) is greatly reduced due to the nonlinear component of the pressure in the Bernoulli relation. This important nonlinear effect is readily included in the NM theory. The nonlinear component of the pressure in the Bernoulli relation also yields a small increase of the sinkage, likewise readily included in the NM theory. Moreover, free-surface nonlinearities can have appreciable, although not large, effects on the wave profile. These nonlinear effects can also be approximately taken into account via a simple transformation of the linear wave profile. Indeed, the flow computations for the four ship models considered here suggest that simple (post-processing) nonlinear corrections (that require no additional flow computations) of the NM theory yield numerical predictions of the wave drag, the sinkage, the trim and the wave profile that agree well with experimental measurements, and compare favorably with predictions given by more complex computational methods.",

The analysis shows that the apparent wake angle associated with the highest waves found inside the cusps of the Kelvin wake as a result of interferences among the divergent waves created by a ship at a high Froude number can be realistically predicted via elementary ship models. In particular, the apparent wake angles for monohull ships and catamarans can be predicted very well via a 2-point model or a 4-point model. Moreover, these models provide basic insight into main features of the farfield waves created by fast ships. Notably, differences between the amplitudes of the bow and stern waves are shown to have no influence on the occurrence of constructive or destructive interferences, although they affect the intensity of wave-interference effects (strong if the amplitudes of the bow and stern waves are commensurate, weak otherwise). Another notable conclusion is that lateral interference effects become more important as the Froude number increases. Indeed, lateral interferences between the twin hulls of a catamaran dominate longitudinal interferences between the fore and aft of the ship at Froude numbers greater than about 1. However, longitudinal interferences between the bow and the stern waves remain dominant for common fast monohull ships.",

This theory is used to illustrate notable features of ship waves in finite water depth. In particular, numerical applications to a monohull ship and catamarans illustrate two notable features of ship waves in shallow water: specifically, the apparent wake angle can be much smaller than Havelocku0027s classical asymptote or cusp angles, and the apparent wake angle in finite water depth is nearly identical to the apparent wake angle in deep water if the water depth is greater than the ship length. Moreover, the numerical illustrations demonstrate the paramount importance of interferences among divergent waves for fast ships. Indeed, constructive interferences among the divergent waves created by a fast ship largely determine the variation of the amplitude of the waves across the ship wake, and therefore the apparent wake angle and the wave drag of the ship, a critical element of ship design. These numerical illustrations also corroborate main conclusions of an approximate analysis of wave interferences in shallow water for monohull ships and catamarans modeled as 2-point wavemakers.",

A classical basic model is the 1-point ship model introduced by Kelvin in 1887 for deep water and extended to uniform finite water depth by Havelock in 1908. Another basic model is the 2-point ship model, which considers the two dominant waves created by the bow and the stern of a monohull ship or by the twin bows of a catamaran, and therefore accounts for main wave interference effects. These 2-point ship models contain information that cannot be found in the classical patterns for the 1-point ship model commonly used since Kelvin. In particular, whereas Havelock\u2019s classical wave patterns for the 1-point model only depend on the Froude number based on the water depth, the farfield waves for the 2-point models of a monohull ship or a catamaran also depend on the Froude number associated with the length of the monohull ship or the spacing between the twin hulls of the catamaran.

A simple approximation that is nearly equivalent to the Kelvin and Peters approximations inside or outside the cusps of the Kelvin wake, but is finite and agrees with Havelock\u2019s approximation at the cusps, is given. This approximation only involves elementary functions, whereas Ursell\u2019s approximation involves the Airy function and its derivative. The simple approximation given here, based on a modification of Ursell\u2019s uniform approximation, combines the approximations given by Kelvin, Havelock and Peters and is then called the Kelvin\u2013Havelock\u2013Peters (KHP) approximation. This approximation is less accurate than Ursell\u2019s approximation. However, the KHP approximation is more realistic than, yet as simple as, Kelvin\u2019s and Peters\u2019 approximations, which are singular at the cusps.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Short-wave approximations are obtained within the framework of the Neumann\u2013Michell (NM) linear theory of potential flow around a ship that travels at a constant speed in calm water. Specifically, the integral over the ship hull surface \u2013 that determines ship waves within the Fourier\u2013Kochin representation related to the NM theory \u2013 is approximated as a line integral around the ship waterline via Laplace\u2019s method. This waterline-integral approximation is further approximated via Kelvin\u2019s method of stationary phase. The short-wave asymptotic approximations obtained via successive applications of Laplace\u2019s method and Kelvin\u2019s method of stationary phase provide theoretical insight into short (transverse and divergent) waves created by ships that travel at low Froude numbers, and short divergent waves created by ships traveling at moderate or high Froude numbers. In particular, these analytical approximations show that short ship waves are related to the Froude number and the hull form in a fairly complicated manner.",

In particular, the Neumann\u2013Michell (NM) boundary-integral representation of steady flow around a ship traveling in calm water is extended to ship motions in regular waves. This extension is straightforward, but points to a complicated and unresolved fundamental issue that is essentially related to the formulation of a linear flow model. Indeed, the NM boundary-integral flow representation for ship motions in regular waves given in the study suggests that the classical Neumann\u2013Kelvin (NK) flow model may be inadequate at a ship waterline.

A number of published studies have investigated the association between cadmium levels and prostate cancer, but the results were inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to get a precise estimate of this subject. After a careful searching and screening, a total of 11 publications containing 14 separated studies were included. Based on a random-effect model, the pooled data showed that cadmium levels of prostate tissues (standard mean difference (SMD)\u2009=\u20093.17, 95 % confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.60\u20135.74, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and plasma (SMD\u2009=\u20094.07, 95 % CI\u2009=\u20092.01\u20136.13, P\u2009<\u20090.05) were significantly higher in prostate cancer patients than those in the healthy controls. No difference of hair and nail cadmium levels between the prostate cancer cases and the controls was found. The data suggested that cadmium exposure might exert an influence on the tumorigenesis of prostate tissues. Future investigations with large sample sizes are needed to verify the results.",

        "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been used as a powerful targeting therapeutic agent for treatment of lung adenocarcinoma for years. Nevertheless, the efficacy of TKI was hampered by the appearance of acquired TKI-resistance. In the present study, we aimed to search, predict, and screen the agents that can overcome the acquired TKI-resistance of lung adenocarcinoma by using the expression profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and Connectivity map (CMAP). The profiles of DEGs were obtained by searching GEO microarray database, and then, they were submitted to CMAP for analysis in order to predict and screen the agent that might reverse the TKI-resistance of lung cancer cells. Next, the effects of the selected agent on TKI-resistant cancer cells were tested and the possible signaling pathways were also evaluated. As a result, valproic acid (VPA) was selected. Then, we used a low-concentration of VPA that has little effect on the cell growth for analysis. Interestingly, the results showed that treatment with a combination of VPA and Erlotinib significantly led to a decrease in cell viability and an increase in cell apoptosis for TKI-resistant HCC827-ER cells, relative to those treated with VPA or Erlotinib alone. Further experiments confirmed that inhibition of MAPK and AKT might be involved in this process. Analyzing the DEGs through the CMAP is a good strategy for exploitation of anti-tumor agents. VPA might markedly increase the sensitivity of TKI-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells to Erlotinib, thus reversing the acquired TKI-resistance of cancer cells and raising VPA as a potential agent for TKI-resistant lung cancer therapy.

However, its efficacy is usually reduced by the occurrence of drug resistance. Our recent study showed that a flavonoid found in many plants, Fisetin, might have a potential to reverse the acquired Cisplatin-resistance of lung adenocarcinoma. In the present study, we aimed to test whether Fisetin could have the ability to reverse Erlotinib-resistance of lung cancer cells. Erlotinib-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells, HCC827-ER, were cultured from the cell line HCC827, and the effects of Fisetin and Erlotinib on the cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated. The possible signaling pathways in this process were also detected. As expected, the results showed that Fisetin effectively increased sensitivity of Erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells to Erlotinib, possibly by inhibiting aberrant activation of MAPK and AKT signaling pathways resulted from AXL suppression. In conclusion, Fisetin was a potential agent for reversing acquired Erlotinib-resistance of lung adenocarcinoma. Inactivation of AXL, MAPK and AKT pathways might play a partial role in this process.",

        "abstract": "Lapatinib, a novel oral dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking HER1 and HER2 pathways, has presented beneficial effects on breast cancer with positive HER2. However, its efficacy is largely limited by the occurrence of acquired drug resistance. In this study, we aimed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of Lapatinib resistance using bioinformatics strategies. The gene expression profile of SKBR3-R (acquired Lapatinib-resistant) and SKBR3 (Lapatinib-sensitive) cell line was downloaded from gene expression omnibus database. Then, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected using dChip software. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were carried out by using DAVID database. Finally, the protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and the hub genes in the network were analyzed by using STRING database. A total of 300 DEGs, such as HSPA5, MAP1LC3A and RASSF2, were screened out. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that the genes were associated with cell membrane component-related, stimulus-related and binding-related items. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that three dysfunctional pathways, including PPAR signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and pathways in cancer, were enriched. Protein-protein interaction network construction revealed that some hub genes, such as PPARG, TGFBI, TGFBR2, TIMP1, CTGF, UBA52 and JUN, might have an association with Lapatinib resistance. The present study offered new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Lapatinib resistance and identified a series of important hub genes that have the potential to be the targets for treatment of Lapatinib-resistant breast cancer.",

Our previous study using bioinformatic analyses has shown that ITGA2 might be a key gene being involved in the Cadmium-induced malignant transformation of liver cells. In the present study, we firstly aimed to learn the possible functions of ITGA2 via bioinformatics analysis, and then test its expression and clinical significance in liver carcinoma specimens through laboratory experiments. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis, as well as protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis has been conducted in Genecards. Then, a tissue microarray containing 90 cases of liver cancer and 90 paired adjacent non-cancerous samples was used for detection of ITGA2 expression by immunohistochemistry assay. Consequently, ITGA2 may be enriched in pathways regarding cell adhesion and migration. PPI analysis suggests that ITGA1, ITGB2, FLT4, LAMB1 and AGRN may have a close relationship with ITGA2. No association between ITGA2 expression and clinical parameters was observed. However, the data showed that ITGA2 might be an independent prognostic factor for liver cancer patients. In conclusion, the data suggest that ITGA2 over-expression might be a potential unfavorable prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target for liver carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "miR-148a-3p downregulation has emerged as a critical factor in cancer progression yet, the underlying mechanisms of miR-148a-3p expression pattern and its function in bladder cancer remains to be elucidated. Here, we illustrate that miR-148a-3p is frequently downregulated in bladder cancer and that its expression may be regulated by DNA methylation. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and miR-148a-3p function in a positive feedback loop in bladder cancer. miR-148a-3p overexpression functions as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer cells. miR-148a-3p inhibits bladder cancer cell proliferation and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) by regulating ERBB3/AKT2/c-myc and ERBB3/AKT2/Snail signaling. ERBB3, DNMT1 and AKT2 are downstream miR-148a-3p target genes. Furthermore, the miR-148a-3p/ERBB3/AKT2/c-myc signaling axis establishes a positive feedback loop in the regulation of bladder cancer. Taken together, our study demonstrates novel regulatory circuits involving miR-148a-3p/ERBB3/AKT2/c-myc and DNMT1 that controls bladder cancer progression, which may be useful in the development of more effective therapies against bladder cancer.",

We identified a miR-877-3p binding site on the promoter site of tumor suppressor gene p16 which alters frequently in bladder cancer. Enforced expression of miR-877-3p could increase the expression of p16, which inhibit the proliferation and tumorigenicity of bladder cancer through cell cycle G1-phase arrest. Further evidences confirmed that the correlation between p16 activation and miR-877-3p was due to the direct binding. These findings demonstrate the anti-tumor function of miR-877-3p in bladder cancer cells and reveal a new pattern of miRNA involved gene regulation.",

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BCa) is the one of the most common cancers with high incidence, occurrence and low 5-year survival rate. Emerging evidence indicates that DLK1-DIO3 genomic region especially the miRNA cluster in this region is involved in several pathologic processes and various cancers, and miR-323a-3p is a member of this miRNA cluster. In this study, we investigate the function and regulatory network of miR-323a-3p in BCa. miR-323a-3p is frequently downregulated in BCa tissues and three cell lines compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues and bladder normal cell line (SV-HUC-1). Besides, downregulation of miR-323a-3p is significantly associated with poor overall survival rate of BCa. Methylation of DLK1-MEG3 intergenic DMR (IG-DMR) contributes to the reduction of miR-323a-3p. Overexpression of miR-323a-3p significantly inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of BCa. Both upregulated MET and SMAD3 are direct targets of miR-323a-3p, and the knockdown of MET and SMAD3 also represses the EMT progression consistently with overexpression of miR-323a-3p. SNAIL is detected in the last targeted confocal protein of both MET and SMAD3 signaling that trigger EMT consequently. Hence, a miR-323a-3p/MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit is established to regulate the EMT progression of BCa. And a mutual regulatory mechanism between miR-323a-3p/miR-433/miR-409 and MET also participates in this circuit. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a novel regulatory mechanism of the miR-323a-3p/MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit that is involved in the EMT regulation of BCa, which may be a potential therapy target for BCa.",

        "abstract": "Apigenin, a natural flavonoid found in vegetables and fruits, has antitumor activity in several cancer types. The present study evaluated the effects and mechanism of action of apigenin in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. We found that apigenin suppressed ACHN, 786-0, and Caki-1 RCC cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A comet assay suggested that apigenin caused DNA damage in ACHN cells, especially at higher doses, and induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest through ATM signal modulation. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated p53 knockdown showed that apigenin-induced apoptosis was likely p53 dependent. Apigenin anti-proliferative effects were confirmed in an ACHN cell xenograft mouse model. Apigenin treatment reduced tumor growth and volume in vivo, and immunohistochemical staining revealed lower Ki-67 indices in tumors derived from apigenin-treated mice. These findings suggest that apigenin exposure induces DNA damage, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, p53 accumulation and apoptosis, which collectively suppress ACHN RCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Given its antitumor effects and low in vivo toxicity, apigenin is a highly promising agent for treatment of RCC.",

        "abstract": " The clinicopathological impacts of c-Met overexpression in bladder cancer have been investigated in several studies with conflicting results. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the pathologic and prognostic roles of c-Met status in bladder cancer patients.  Eligible studies were searched and identified from the PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases (up until October 4, 2018). The DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled risk estimates.  Eight studies including 1,336 bladder cancer cases were eventually included in this meta-analysis. We detected a significantly increased risk of poor overall survival (OS) associated with the high expression of c-Met (HR=2.42, 95% CI 1.36-4.32). There was no association between c-Met status and nuclear grade (OR=0.82, 95% CI 0.29-2.31) or tumor stage (OR=1.42, 95% CI 0.41-4.89).  This study shows that the overexpression of c-Met in primary cancer tissues is associated with a worse OS in human bladder cancer. However, larger studies using standardized methods and criteria are warranted to verify these findings.",

Methods  A systematic literature search of articles update to February 2015 was conducted via Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, and the references of the retrieved articles. Fixed- or random-effect models were used to summarize the estimates of OR with 95% CIs for the highest versus the lowest exposure of pesticide.    Results  The pooled OR estimates indicated that pesticide exposure was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (OR=1.649, 95% CI 1.223-2.223). In subgroup analysis, we detected pesticide exposure demonstrated as a significant risk factor on bladder cancer in America (OR=1.741, 95% CI 1.270-2.388). Similar results were discovered in both case-control group and cohort group (OR=2.075, 95% CI 1.183-3.638, OR=1.146, 95% CI 1.074-1.223, respectively). No evidence of publication bias was found by Begg\u2019s or Egger\u2019s test (P = 0.210, P = 0.358, respectively).    Conclusion  In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicated that pesticide exposure was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Further researches should be conducted to confirm the findings in our study and better clarify the potential biological mechanisms.",

However, the roles of miR-124-3p in human bladder cancer are elusive. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the biological functions and its molecular mechanisms of miR-124-3p in human bladder cancer cell lines, discussing whether it has a potential to be a therapeutic biomarker of bladder cancer.Three human bladder cancer cell lines and samples from ten patients with bladder cancer were analyzed for the expression of miR-124-3p by quantitative RT--PCR. Exogenetic overexpression of miR-124-3p was established by transfecting mimics into T24, UM-UC-3 and J82 cells, after that cell proliferation and cell cycle were assessed by MTT assay, flow cytometry and Colony-forming assay. Cell motility and invasion ability were evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell assay. Tissue microarray, and immunohistochemistry with antibodies against ROCK1, MMP2 and MMP9 was performed using the peroxidase and DAB methods. The target gene of miR-124-3p was determined by luciferase assays, quantitative RT--PCR and western blot. The regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by miR-124-3p was analyzed by western blot.miR-124-3p is frequently down-regulated in bladder cancer both in three bladder cancer cell lines, T24, UM-UC-3, J82 and clinical samples. Overexpression of miR-124-3p induced G1-phase arrest in T24, UM-UC-3 and J82 cell lines and suppressed cell growth in colony-forming assay. miR-124-3p significantly repressed the capability of migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells. In addition, ROCK1 was identified as a new target of miR-124-3p. ROCK1, MMP2, MMP9 were up-regulated in bladder cancer tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrated miR-124-3p could inhibit bladder cancer cell epithelial mesenchymal transfer, and regulated the expression of c-Met, MMP2, MMP9.miR-124-3p can repress the migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells via regulating ROCK1. Our data indicate that miR-124-3p could be a tumor suppressor and may have a potential to be a diagnostics or predictive biomarker in bladder cancer.",

The two strategies were also compared for their ability to detect lesions with different degrees of suspicion on MRI and clinically significant prostate cancer, and the number of cores needed for diagnosis. The Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Medline were searched from inception until May 1, 2015. Meta-analysis was conducted via RevMan 5.2 software. Data was expressed as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval. Trial sequential analysis was used to assess risk of random errors. Fourteen trials were included, encompassing a total of 3105 participants. We found that MR/US fusion biopsy detected more prostate cancers than systematic biopsy (46.9% vs. 44.2%, p=0.03). In men with moderate/high MRI suspicion, MR/US fusion biopsy did better than systematic biopsy (RR = 1.46; p < 0.05) for making a diagnosis. Moreover, MR/US fusion biopsy detected more clinically significant cancers than systematic biopsy (RR = 1.19; p < 0.05). We recommend that MR/US fusion prostate biopsy be used to better detect prostate cancer, particularly in patients with moderate/high suspicion lesions on MRI.",

The need for collective communication arises in many problems of parallel and distributed computing, including Grid or cloud computing and database management. We describe the network model, formulate the reliable collective communication problem, prove that the maximum reliable collective communication problem is NP-hard, and provide an integer linear program (ILP) formulation for the problem. We then provide a greedy approximation algorithm to construct collective communication (through a spanning tree) that achieves an approximation ratio of 1 + ln(|V| + \u03b1|E| - 1), where is the average number of shared link risk groups (SRLGs) along links, and |V| and |E| are the total number of vertices and edges of the network, respectively. Simulations demonstrate that our approximation algorithm achieves good performance in both small and large networks and that, in almost 95% of total cases, our algorithm outperforms the modified minimum spanning tree algorithms.",

        "abstract": "In multi-domain optical networks, due to confidentiality and management considerations, it may be infeasible to broadcast complete domain state information among domains. Nevertheless, sufficient information on each domain is required in order to keep network activities operating successfully. Topology Aggregation (TA) may be adopted to abstract a domain's detailed topology into an aggregated topology which only shows limited information about the network. With the introduction of Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs), each of which includes a set of links affected by the same failure, the TA approach needs to consider the presence of SRLGs to generate a more survivable aggregated topology. In this paper, we propose SRLG-aware topology aggregation approaches that can help in finding a pair of inter-domain paths with a minimum set of common SRLGs.",

Anycasting is a communication paradigm in which a source node sends data to any one out of multiple candidate destinations. In WDM networks, the standard anycasting problem involves the establishment of a connection from the source to any one destination with the objective of minimizing the resources used. In order to provide survivability, the problem can be extended to find both a connection to a primary destination and a connection to a backup destination. The connections, which may require an amount of bandwidth that may be less than the bandwidth of an entire wavelength, can be groomed with other connections in the WDM network.

        "abstract": "Internet protocol television (IPTV) refers to multimedia content services (e.g. television programs, video on demand, audio, graphics, etc.) that are distributed over an Internet protocol (IP) network. IPTV is viewed as the next killer application for the broadband networks due to its flexibility and high bandwidth requirement. Therefore, in the dissertation, we focus on resource-efficient, energy-efficient, secure, and correct multimedia content delivery through broadband optical core and wireless access networks. We first study multi-class multicast flow aggregation, which takes security into consideration. Given the available network resources, a secure level of each multimedia program, a set of requests for multimedia programs, the objective of our work is to find an approach to the joint optimization of the multi-class multicast flow aggregation and light-tree establishment (MMFA) problem. We model the problem with an aggregation graph as well as an optical transport network graph. We then develop an integer linear programming (ILP) and four heuristics for the MMFA problem. Simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of both our ILP model and heuristics. More often than not, optical networks provide multiple capacities (line rates). When we deliver multimedia content through multiple line rate optical networks, the highest line rate may not always be preferred. The reason is that 1) higher line rates may suffer more impairments than lower line rates; and 2) higher line rate consume higher energy. Therefore, we consider multicast flow aggregation with impairment constraints and with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption. We employ a novel graph model for dynamic multicast aggregation and focus on the aggregation problem in optical networks. An on-line aggregation algorithm is developed based on the graph model to achieve various objectives under different aggregation policies. In this work, we also consider IPTV delivery in a wireless access network to provide \"last-mile\" transmission from sources to end users. Since end users may have different wireless devices, they may have different display resolution requirements. Current systems provide simulcast for IPTV service in which each base station (BS) broadcasts a program repeatedly over the maximum transmission range, one resolution at a time. This approach is an extremely energy consuming method. Thus, the problem of how to design an energy-efficient simulcast scheme for BSs in a region to guarantee successful communication and QoS is an important problem. We develop an algorithm (named RingCover) and prove that the algorithm can achieve the optimal solution in terms of energy consumption for a single base station. On the other hand, the energy-efficient simulcast for multiple base stations is proved to be NP-hard.",

        "abstract": "Light-trees can efficiently guarantee point-to-multipoint connection in optical networks for many widely used multicast applications, such as Internet protocol television (IPTV). The establishment of a light-tree requires the placement of 3R regenerators along the tree due to the wavelength continuity constraint and physical impairments. Thus, the problem is to establish a light-tree and to assign wavelengths such that the number of regenerators is minimized. We call this problem the efficient 3R regenerator placement (ERP) problem. If we fix the routing of the multicast tree, then how to place a minimum number of regenerators and assign wavelengths to links becomes a subproblem of ERP, which is named the wavelength assignment and regenerator placement (WARP) problem. We find that ERP is NP-hard, and then provide an approximation algorithm named SPT-ReWa, which has a subroutine named ReWa which can solve WARP optimally. We prove that ReWa can find an optimal solution for WARP, and we analyze the approximation ratio of SPT-ReWa for ERP. Finally, we illustrate several simulation scenarios to show the efficiency of SPT-ReWa.",

        "abstract": "A Connected Dominating Set (CDS) can be used to construct a virtual backbone for wireless and mobile ad-hoc networks to make the system hierarchical and efficient. A virtual backbone can significantly improve network throughput, optimize broadband utilization, extend network lifetime, and reduce interference as well as packet retrans- missions. Calculating a minimum backbone for a network is critical to reduce routing computation and energy consumption. This problem is a well-known NP-hard optimiza- tion problem, which has various applications in practice. In this paper, we propose a new problem based on customer fairness, which looks for a minimum CDS in a given com- munication model with shortest path constraints. It guarantees that any two clients can communicate with each other through this CDS with hop counts the same as the best path from the original graph, which means that routing on such a CDS will not bring additional traffic for every client. We name this problem as shortest path connected dom- inating set (SPCDS) and prove its NP-hardness by reduction from Hitting Set .T hen we propose a centralized greedy algorithm and an efficient distributed approximation algorithm with approximation ratio \u2206 to solve SPCDS, where \u2206 is the maximum vertex degree in the given topology. We also analyze the time complexity, message complexity, and evaluate the efficiency of our distributed heuristic by several numerical experiments and comparisons with previous literatures.",

        "abstract": "MultiMedia DataBase Management System (MMDBMS) becomes more popular in recent years, which supports complex and large multimedia data like images, audios, and videos etc. Data Broadcasting is an attractive approach for data dissemination to improve the limitations in mobile environment, such as narrow bandwidth, unreliable connections, and battery limitation. However, existing data broadcast schemes are inefficient for MMDBMS. In this paper, we present four novel multimedia data broadcast schemes (namely, SDAA, MDAA, AEA, and COA) specifically for wireless multichannel communications. The major strategies are scalable coding to generate data segments to different qualities, indexing and channel assignment to minimize the expected waiting time for clients. We prove theoretically that SDAA is a 2-approximation. COA performs best when we release the constraints and it can be judged as an theoretical lower bound, while AEA outputs local optimal solution with quality allocation constraints. Finally, SDAA+AEA form a best scheduling for practical applications. We also provide numerical experiments to evaluate the system performance, proving the efficiency of our schemes.",

        "abstract": "We improve the efficiency of static timing analysis when false paths are considered. The efficiency of timing analysis is critical for the performance driven optimization program because timing analysis is invoked heavily in the inner loop. However, when false paths are dealt with in timing analysis, a large number of tags needs to be created and propagated, thus deteriorating efficiency. In this paper, we minimize the number of the tags through a biclique-covering approach, which iteratively removes a tag if the false path information in the tag is covered by the union of other tags. With the produced tags, we remove the false path timing and guarantee to cover the nonfalse path timing. Since the minimum biclique covering of the general bipartite graph is NP complete [ Indag. Math., vol. 39, p. 211, 1977], [ Discrete Math., vol. 149, no. 1-3, p. 159, 1996], we use a minimal degree ordering approach to perform the biclique-covering minimization. The experimental results show significant reduction on the number of tags",

This paper describes an efficient heuristic algorithm to arrange the power-up sequence in a multi-domain power network in order to minimize the noise. We present a formulation of this problem and show it is NP-complete. Therefore, we propose a simulated annealing (SA) based algorithm with preprocessing. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can minimize the noise close to the minimal values. In terms of efficiency, the SA algorithm is more than hundreds of times faster than the enumerating method and the running time scales well for these cases with the number of domains. In addition, we discuss the trade off between power-up efficiency and noise.",

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important tool in diagnosis of heart disease. However, the normal 12-lead ECG can only record limited aspects of heart's electrical signals and mostly their interpretation relies on trained and experienced medical doctors. We have performed experiments in which heart signals were recorded in high spatial resolution. Independent component analysis was applied to the recorded signals to separate distinct temporal components of the recorded signals. The separated components were further analyzed by back-projecting their activities to the surface montage to examine each component's property. Experimental results show this to be a promising approach that can be extended to build more detailed heart activity simulations",

For each compact placement, there is a corresponding encoding. The number of possible tree-sequence combinations is (n+1)n-1(n!)2, the lowest among complete 3-D representations up to date. The construction of placement from an encoding needs O(n2) in the worst case, but in practical cases we expect O(n4\u20443 log n) time on average for circuit blocks with limited length/width ratios.

This paper proposes a novel method that unifies these two objectives in a multi-commodity flow (MCF) formulation. With an improved fully polynomial approximation algorithm, power efficient design of an 8 x 8 NoC can be found for given average latency constraints with certain communication bandwidth requirements. Experimental results suggest that (1) compared with mesh, torus and hypercube topologies, the optimized design can improve power latency product by up to 52.1%, 29.4% and 35.6%, respectively. (2) by sacrificing 2% latency, power consumption of the optimized design can be improved by up to 19.4%, which indicates the importance of power and latency co-optimization in NoC design.",

        "abstract": "The advent of new technologies brings revolutions in the fields of VLSI design and high performance computing. On one hand, the increasing number of processing elements, both in on-chip multi-core systems and supercomputer systems, demands high bandwidth communications. On the other hand, the performance of the system, usually measured by the latency and power consumption, is gradually being dominated by the interconnection networks. These facts raise challenges in synthesizing and optimizing interconnection networks. In this dissertation, we study methodologies and algorithms to perform the interconnection network synthesis and optimization in both on-chip networks and supercomputer systems. We explore a wide range of network topologies and physical implementations, and evaluate the performance of multi-commodity flow (MCF) algorithms. We design efficient approximation schemes to solve different variations of MCF problems, which incorporate different practical constraints. The automated design flows discover much larger design space than the traditional methods and therefore achieve promising results. In the study of Network-on-Chip (NoC), we are optimizing the communication latency and power consumption, which are two competing design objectives. With an improved fully polynomial approximation algorithm, power optimal design of a structured 8 \u00d7 8 NoC can be found for given average latency constraints with certain communication bandwidth requirements. Our methodology explores a large number of topologies, introduces a variety of wire styles into NoC design, and incorporates latency constraints and power minimization objectives into a unified MCF model, with simultaneous optimization on network topologies, physical embedding, and interconnect wire styles. The results demonstrate the strengths of the optimized networks and indicate the clear trend of power and latency tradeoffs. In the synthesis and optimization of networks in supercomputer systems, we use the packaging framework of the Blue Gene/L supercomputer as an example to demonstrate the advantages of our design flow, which has incorporated real design issues, such as board dimensions and pin numbers. Using real benchmark traces, the experiments show that the best topologies identified by our algorithm can achieve better average latency compared to the existing 3-dimensional torus networks.",

Many high-level synthesis techniques have been developed to find optimal prefix structures for specific applications. However, the gap between these techniques and back-end designs is increasingly large. In this paper, we propose an integer linear programming method to build minimal-power prefix adders within given timing and area constraints. It counts both gate and wire capacitances in the timing and power models, considers static and dynamic power consumptions, and can handle gate sizing and buffer insertion to improve the performance further. The proposed method is also adaptive for non-uniform arrival time and required time on each bit position. Therefore our method produces the optimum prefix adder for realistic constraints.",

        "abstract": "We improve the efficiency of static timing analysis when false paths are considered. The efficiency of timing analysis is critical for the performance driven optimization program because timing analysis is invoked heavily in the inner loop. However, when false paths are dealt in timing analysis, a large number of tags need to be created and propagated, and thus deteriorated the efficiency. In this paper, we minimize the number of the tags through a biclique covering approach, which iteratively removes a tag if the false path information in the tag is covered by the union of other tags. The produced tags remove the false path timing and guarantee to cover the true path timings. Since the minimum biclique covering of the general bipartite graph is NP complete, we use a minimal degree ordering approach to perform the biclique covering minimization. The experimental results show significant reduction on the number of tags.",

        "abstract": "Incorporating programmable logic devices (PLD) in digital design courses has become increasingly popular. The advantages of using PLDs, such as complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), have been discussed before. However, previous studies have focused on the experiences from the point of view of the instructor, with some general impressions from the students. This paper instead focuses on the students' point of view, and most importantly, investigates whether the use of programmable logic has helped facilitate the learning process. This investigation was based on the results of a comprehensive survey that was given to the class shortly before the end of the term, and a comparison of final exam scores between a previous class that did not use PLDs and the current class that did use PLDs. The surveys and their test scores provide solid evidence as to gauge whether using PLDs really does benefit students trying to learn digital design and basic computer architecture.",

        "abstract": "We propose two orthogonal approaches to logarithmic cyclic shifter design. The first method, called fanout splitting, replaces multiplexers in a conventional design with demultiplexers which have two fanouts driving the shifting and non-shifting paths separately. The use of demultiplexers has a two-fold effect; it cuts the accumulated wire load on the critical path from O(Nlog2(N)) to O(N), and reduces the switching probabilities on the inter-stage long wires from 1/4 to 3/16. We then perform cell order optimization to further improve the delay, and formulate it as an integer linear programming problem. For the 64-bit case, the two approaches together reduce the total delay by 67.1% and dynamic power consumption by 17.6%, respectively.",

We first present a voltage response in an arbitrary multi-domain clock gating pattern, using a superposition technique. Then, an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation is proposed to identify the worst-case gating pattern and the maximum variation area. The ILP based method is significantly faster than a conventional method based on enumeration. The experimental results are also compared with a case where peak voltage variation is induced, which shows the latter technique largely underestimated the overall variation effect.",

Conventional ECG recordings, however, use a limited number of channels (12) and each records a mixture of activities generated in different parts of the heart. Therefore, direct observation of the ECG signals collected on the body surface is likely an inefficient way to study and diagnose cardiac abnormalities. This study describes new experimental and analytical methods to capture more meaningful ECG component signals, each representing more directly a physical cardiac source. This study first describes a simply applied method for collecting high-density ECG signals. The recorded signals are then separated by independent component analysis (ICA) to obtain spatially fixed and temporally independent component activations. Results from five subjects show that P-, QRS-, and T-waves can be clearly separated from the recordings, suggesting ICA might be an effective and useful tool for high-density ECG analysis, interpretation, and diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "AIM To investigate the mechanism of volatile oil extracted from Alpinia oxyphylla Miq. fruit (VOA) underlying the brain protection. METHODS C57BL mice were randomly divided into 6 groups: normal control, model, positive control selegiline 10 mg\u00b7kg-1 group, VOA 0.278,0.833 and 2.5 mL\u00b7kg-1groups. Except normal control and model groups, the mice were preadministrated ig VOA or selegiline, once daily for 12 d. On the 6th day, except normal control group, the mice were ip given 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) 30 mg\u00b7kg-1 once daily for 7 d to prepare Parkinson disease model. All the mice were sacrificed on the next day after the last administration. The contents of homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) in mice corpus striatum were determined by using fluorophotometer. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, glutathione (GSH) and maleic dialdehyde (MDA) contents in mice corpus striatum were determined with colorimetric assay. The expression of Bcl-2 and caspase 3 in nerve cells of substantia nigra was detected by using SABC immunohisto-chemical method. RESULTSCompared with normal control group, HVA, 5-HT and GSH contents, and SOD activity in corpus striatum of model mice decreased, and MDA content increased significantly. Otherwise, numbers of Bcl-2 and caspase 3 immune reaction positive cells in substantia nigra increased significantly. Pre-administration of VOA 0.833 and 2.5 mL\u00b7kg-1 significantly inhibited HVA and GSH contents and SOD activity decrease induced by MPTP, and MDA content was inhibited, too. VOA 2.5 mL\u00b7kg-1 inhibited decrease of 5-HT content. VOA 0.833 and 2.5 mL\u00b7kg-1 increased Bcl-2 and inhibited caspase 3 expressions in substantia nigra of model mice. The effects of VOA 2.5 mL\u00b7kg-1 on the above parameters were similar with those of selegiline. CONCLUSION The protection of VOA on brain may relate to the release of monoami neurotransmitters in corpus striatum increased, oxidative stress alleviated and neuronal apoptosis in substantia nigra reduced.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the therapeutic effect of ethyl acetate extract from Pongamia pinnata roots (PREA) on ethanol-induced gastric lesions. METHODS: The experimental gastric mucosal injuries were prepared by ig ethanol to rats, and the protective effect of PREA was evaluated by calculating lesion index, observing pathological changes, and measuring the contents of nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) from gastric mucosal tissue. In addition, gastric secretary and gastric wall adherent mucus were studied with the pylorus-ligation rat model. RESULTS: Compared with the model control group, PREA (50, 150 and 450 mg\u00b7kg-1, ig) dose-dependently prevented the gastric mucosal damages induced by ethanol, its inhibition rates were 28.7%, 57.7% and 78.7%, respectively. The pathomorphology lesions of mucosal tissue were obviously ameliorated. PREA obviously antagonized the ethanol-induced elevation of MDA content, and reduction of NO level and SOD activity of gastric mucosa. PREA significantly reduced gastric juice volume, free acidity, total acidity and total acid output, but didn't affect the pepsin activity. Moreover, PREA obviously increased adherent mucus quantity of stomach wall, as well as free mucus quantity dissolved in gastric juice of pylorus-ligation rat. CONCLUSION: PREA has protective effect on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injuries, which suggests that PREA may be used for protection or treatment of human ethanol-induced gastric lesions.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To explore therapeutic effect of volatile oil from A. longiligulare T. L. Wu (VOA) on ulcerative colitis (UC) and its possible mechanisms. METHODS: UC model was established by an enema of 2,4-dinitrobenzene-1-chlorobenzene (DNCB) and acetic acid. SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: normal control, UC model, UC + VOA (0.42, 0.84 and 1.68 g\u00b7kg -1) and UC + sulfasalazine (SSZ) 0.52 g\u00b7kg -1 treated groups. The rats were ig administered with normal saline in normal control and UC model groups, and rats in other 4 groups were ig given VOA or SSZ once a day for 21 d, respectively. All rats were sacrificed 21 d after drug administration and the macroscopic and histological changes in colons were evaluated. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) from colon tissue was measured with pyrograllol auto-oxidation assay and spectrophotometric method was used to detect the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and the contents of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The percentage of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and nuclear factor-\u03baB p65 (NF-\u03baBp65) positive cells in colon tissue was determined with immunohistochemical assay. RESULTS: Compared with normal control group, the score of macroscopical and histological features in UC group was significantly increased. Colonic mucosal defect, lymphoid tissue hyperplasia, glandular disorders, a large number of lymphocyte-predominant inflammatory cell infiltration and vascular dilation could be observed. The SOD and GSH-Px activities were obviously lower, and NOS level was significantly higher in colon tissue. The TNT-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baBp65 expressions in colon tissue also increased. Compared with UC group, UC + VOA (0.84 and 1.68 g\u00b7kg -1) reduced colon macro3 scopic and histological damage significantly, elevated the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, reduced the content of NOS and inhibited the protein expressions of TNT-\u03b1; and NF-\u03baBp65 in colon tissues. CONCLUSION: VOA may reduce inflammatory reaction and protect mucosa from UC. The probable mechanism was that it can inhibit TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baBp65, and then suppress the inflammatory cascade from UC.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To study the effect of total flavonoids of Pongamia pinnata roots(PRF) on ulcerative colitis(UC) induced by dextran sulphate sodium(DSS) in mice and the possible mechanism. METHODS: Balb/c mice were fed with 4% DSS solution for 7 d to induce ulcerative colitis and treated with sulfasalazine(SASP) as positive control.The clinical symptom and the lesion of colonic mucosa were observed and the levels of T-AOC\u3001MDA\u3001NO and the activity of NOS in colonic tissue were tested. RESULTS: Compared with the model control,the clinical symptom and the lesion of colonic mucosa in treatment group were remarkably improved after administration of PRF in large or medium dose.In the two groups,the decrease in the levels of MDA,NO and the activity of NOS,and the increase in the levels of F-AOC could be found.(P<0.05,P<0.01).There was no significant difference between the large dosage PRF treated group and the SASP group(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that significant effect of PRF on DSS-induced UC may attributae to reduction in free radical,depression of lipid peroxidation and enhancement of antioxidant capability.",

To assess EA on daily rhythmicity of intestinal movement and circadian rhythmicity of colonic  expression in rats with SCI. . Rats were randomized to the sham, SCI, and SCI+EA groups. EA was performed at bilateral Zusanli point (ST36) during daytime (11:00-11:30) for 14 days following SCI. Intestinal transit and daily rhythmicity of intestinal movement were assessed. Circadian rhythmicity of colonic  expression was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. . EA shortened the stool efflux time and increased the dry fecal weight within 24\u2009h in SCI rats. Daily rhythmicity of intestinal movements was unaffected by SCI. The expression of colonic  peaked at 20:00 and the nadir was observed at 8:00 in the SCI and sham groups. In the SCI+EA group, colonic  expression peaked at 12:00 and 20:00, and the nadir was observed at 8:00. . SCI did not change the circadian rhythmicity of colonic  expression in rats, and daily intestinal movement rhythmicity was retained.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThis study proposes a novel occupational therapy (OT) practice tool derived from the native concept of the Tai Chi diagram. Four elements of the Tai Chi diagram, namely, Yang, Yin, Yang kernel, and Yin kernel, are matched to the elements of the OT practice, namely, person, environment, economic condition, and mental condition, respectively. The entire circle of the diagram represents occupational performance. The interaction between persons and the environment can be regarded as the interaction between Yin and Yang with balance as the focal point. This proposed tool may be an innovative means to facilitate communication between clients and therapists for OT in China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Spasticity is a motor disorder encountered after upper motor neuron lesions. It adversely affects quality of life in most patients and causes long-term burden of care and has significant financial implications. The effect of conventional therapies for spasticity including physical therapy, surgery, and pharmacotherapy are not always satisfying because of the short-term effects or side effects in some patients. Acupuncture is a part of traditional medicine originating from China. It has been used to resolve functional recovery problems after central nervous system injury for many years in Asian countries and is increasingly popular in western countries. Some researches suggest that acupuncture has therapeutic potential to help improve limb movement function and decrease the severity of spasticity. This review synthesizes studies involving stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis to give an overall picture of the effect and potential mechanisms of acupuncture on spasticity occurring after upper motor neuron lesions. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that electroacupuncture combined with conventional routine care (pharmacological/rehabilitation) could reduce spasticity and improve motor function and activities in daily living after stroke. However, there is not enough evidence to conclude that acupuncture (including electroacupuncture) could reduce spasticity with other central nervous system diseases.",

Data were analyzed using the standardized weighted mean difference (SMD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.A total of 3 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The SMD and its 95% CI were not calculated owing to unreported standard deviations in the individual studies. The average and p-values of statistical difference indicated that the total bowel care time (p<0.05), time to flatus (p<0.05), and defecation period (p<0.05) were shorter in patients treated with PGB than in patients treated with VOB. No significant difference was observed in time to clean up (p>0.05) between patients in the PGB and VOB groups.Based on the results, we conclude that the PGB suppository could act faster than the VOB suppository in the treatment of NBD in patients with SCI.",

Although this condition has attracted wide attention in the world, there have been few studies on it in China. So far, the theory of Chinese medicine for the treatment of SCI and neurogenic bowel dysfunction after SCI has not been established. Fortunately, Chinese medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal autonomic nervous system dysfunction has been recognized. The finding that Chinese medicine is effective in the treatment of bowel dysfunction and can improve patients' quality of life lays a foundation for further studies on neurogenic bowel dysfunction.

However, whether PM size plays a critical role in these effects is unclear in the population studies. This study investigated the association between the ambient concentrations of PM with varies sizes (5.6-560nm) and a biomarker of acute respiratory inflammation, the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), in a panel of 55 elderly people in Shanghai, China. Linear mixed-effect model was fitted to estimate the association between FENO and moving average concentrations of PM, adjusting for temperature, relative humidity, day of the week, and age. Results showed that among the measured particles size range, Aitken-mode (20-100nm) particles had the strongest positive association with increased FENO when using moving average concentration of PM up to 24h prior to visits. The estimates were robust to the adjustment for gender, condition of chronic disease and use of medication, and to the sensitive analysis using different times of visits. The authors concluded that the association between acute respiratory inflammation and PM concentration of fine particulates depended on particle size, and suggested Aitken-mode particles may be the most responsible for this adverse health association.

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Vehicle  are major sources of atmospheric pollutants in urban areas, especially in megacities around the world. Various vehicle emission control policies have been implemented to improve air quality. However, the effectiveness of these policies is unclear, due to a lack of systematic evaluation and sound methodologies. During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, China 2014, the Chinese government implemented the strictest vehicle emission control policy in the countryu0027s history, which provided an opportunity to evaluate its effectiveness, based on our recently developed method. To evaluate the vehicle emission reduction, we used a mobile research platform to measure the main air pollutants (PM 2.5 , black carbon (BC), SO 2 , CO, NO  x   and O 3 ) on the 4th ring road of the city of Beijing, combined with a continuous wavelet transform method (CWT) to separate out instantaneous emissions by passing vehicles. The results suggested that our measurements captured the spatial distribution and variation of atmospheric pollutant concentrations on the 4th ring road. The instantaneous concentration decomposed by the CWT method represents on-road  better than other methods reported in the literature. With this method, we found that the daytime vehicle emission of CO and NO  x   decreased by 28.1 and 16.3 %, respectively, during the APEC period relative to the period before APEC, and by 39.3 and 38.5 %, respectively, relative to the period after APEC. The nighttime vehicle  of CO and NO  x   decreased by 56.0 and 60.7 %, respectively, during the APEC period relative to the period after APEC. Because vehicle  of NO  x   and CO contribute considerably to the total  of these pollutants in Beijing, the vehicle emission control policy implementation was extremely successful in controlling air quality during APEC 2014, China.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Chinese cities have suffered severe events of haze air pollution, particularly in the North China Plain (NCP). Investigating the temporal and spatial distribution of pollutants, emissions, and pollution transport is necessary to better understand the effect of various sources on air quality. We report on mobile differential optical absorption spectroscopy (mobile DOAS) observations of precursors SO 2  and NO 2  vertical columns in NCP in summer of 2013 (from 11 June to 7 July) in this study. The different temporal and spatial distributions of SO 2  and NO 2  vertical column density (VCD) over this area are characterized under various wind fields. The results show that the transport from southern NCP strongly affects the air quality in Beijing, and the transport route, particularly SO 2  transport of Shijiazhuang\u2013Baoding\u2013Beijing is identified. In addition, the major contributors to SO 2  along the route of Shijiazhuang\u2013Baoding\u2013Beijing are elevated sources and low area sources for the route of Dezhou\u2013Cangzhou\u2013Tianjin\u2013Beijing are found using the interrelated analysis between in situ and mobile DOAS observations during the measurement periods. Furthermore, the discussion of hot spot near Ji\u2019nan City shows that the average observed width of polluted air mass is 11.83\u2009km and 17.23\u2009km associated with air mass diffusion, which is approximately 60\u2009km away from emission sources based on geometrical estimation. Finally, a reasonable agreement exists between OMI and mobile DOAS observations with correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.65 for NO 2  VCDs. Both datasets also have similar spatial pattern. The fitted slop of 0.55 is significantly less than unity can reflect the contamination of local sources and OMI observations need to improve the sensitivities to the near-surface emission sources through the improvements of retrieval algorithm or resolution of satellites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  The North China Plain (NCP) has been experiencing severe air pollution problems with rapid economic growth and urbanisation. Many field and model studies have examined the distribution of air pollutants in the NCP, but convincing results have not been achieved, mainly due to a lack of direct measurements of pollutants over large areas. Here, we employed a mobile laboratory to observe the main air pollutants in a large part of the NCP from 11\u00a0June to 15\u00a0July 2013. High median concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) (12  ppb), nitrogen oxides (NO  x  ) (NO  +  NO 2 ; 452  ppb), carbon monoxide (CO) (956  ppb), black carbon (BC; 5.5  \u00b5g  m \u22123 ) and ultrafine particles (28  350  cm \u22123 ) were measured. Most of the high values, i.e. 95\u00a0percentile concentrations, were distributed near large cities, suggesting the influence of local emissions. In addition, we analysed the regional transport of SO 2  and CO, relatively long-lived pollutants, based on our mobile observations together with wind field and satellite data analyses. Our results suggested that, for border areas of the NCP, wind from outside this area would have a diluting effect on pollutants, while south winds would bring in pollutants that have accumulated during transport through other parts of the NCP. For the central NCP, the concentrations of pollutants were likely to remain at high levels, partly due to the influence of regional transport by prevalent south\u2013north winds over the NCP and partly by local emissions.",

        "title": "Observation of regional air pollutant transport between the megacity Beijing and the North China Plain",
        "abstract": "Abstract.  Megacities have strong interactions with the surrounding regions through transport of air pollutants. It has been frequently addressed that the air quality of Beijing is influenced by the influx of air pollutants from the North China Plain (NCP). Estimations of air pollutant cross-boundary transport between Beijing and the NCP are important for air quality management. However, evaluation of cross-boundary transport using long-term observations is very limited. Using the observational results of the gaseous pollutants SO 2 , NO, NO 2 , O 3 , and CO from August 2006 to October 2008 at the Yufa site, a cross-boundary site between the megacity Beijing and the NCP, together with meteorological parameters, we explored a method for evaluating the transport flux intensities at Yufa, as part of the \u201cCampaign of Air Quality Research in Beijing and Surrounding Region 2006\u20132008\u201d (CAREBeijing 2006\u20132008). The hourly mean  \u00b1  SD (median) concentration of SO 2 , NO, NO 2 , NO  x  , O 3 , O  x  , and CO was 15  \u00b1  16 (9)  ppb, 12  \u00b1  25 (3)  ppb, 24  \u00b1  19 (20)  ppb, 36  \u00b1  39 (23)  ppb, 28  \u00b1  27 (21)  ppb, 52  \u00b1  24 (45)  ppb, and 1.6  \u00b1  1.4 (1.2) ppm during the observation period, respectively. The bivariate polar plots showed the dependence of pollutant concentrations on both wind speed and wind direction, and thus inferred their dominant transport directions. Surface flux intensity calculations further demonstrated the regional transport influence of Beijing and the NCP on Yufa. The net surface transport flux intensity (mean  \u00b1  SD) of SO 2 , NO, NO 2 , NO  x  , O 3 , O  x  , and CO was 6.2  \u00b1  89.5, \u22124.3  \u00b1  29.5, \u22120.6  \u00b1  72.3, \u22124.9  \u00b1  93.0, 14.7  \u00b1  187.8, 14.8  \u00b1  234.9, and 70  \u00b1  2830  \u00b5g  s \u22121   m \u22122  during the observation period, respectively. For SO 2 , CO, O 3 , and O  x   the surface flux intensities from the NCP to Yufa surpassed those from Beijing to Yufa in all seasons except winter, with the strongest net fluxes largely in summer, which were about 4\u20138 times those of other seasons. The surface transport flux intensity of NO  x   from Beijing to Yufa was stronger than that from the NCP to Yufa except in summer, with the strongest net flux in winter, which was about 1.3\u20138 times that of other seasons. The flux intensities were then assigned to the corresponding trajectories in the potential source contribution function analysis (PSCF), which confirmed the results of flux intensity calculations. Our study also suggested that various factors, such as the wind field, emission inventory, and photochemical reactions, could influence transport of air pollutants. The decrease of surface flux intensity during the Olympic Games implied the role of both local emission reduction and regional cooperation in successful air quality management. Three dimensional observations are needed for further comprehensive discussion of the regional transport between Beijing and the NCP.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) with 3D microspheres structure was prepared and used for adsorption of phosphate and photodegradation of dyes in phosphate-dye binary system for the first time. BiOI exhibited excellent adsorption capacity of phosphate up to 55.80\u202fmg P/L and outstanding photocatalytic activities for all the cationic dyes in phosphate-cationic dye binary system. RhB was 100% photodegraded within 50\u202fmin, and the photodegradation rates of MB and FB reached 92% and 95% within 100\u202fmin, respectively. But in phosphate-anionic/neutral dye binary system, BiOI displayed only good adsorption performance of phosphate but showed no photodegradation performance for anionic or neutral dyes. The mechanism was proposed as that PO 4  3\u2212  adsorbed on the surface of BiOI, which changed from being neutral into being negatively charged, and then the cationic dyes were absorbed due to electrostatic attraction for photodegradation. The photodegradation was confirmed that the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band (CB) of BiOI which could reduce O 2  to \u00b7O 2  \u2212  and associate with h +  oxidized the cationic dyes. This work established a new approach of photodegrading organic dyes and adsorbing phosphate in waterbodies, and provided a new insight into wastewater treatment with two or more pollutants.",

Magnetite Fe304 permits easy recovery after photocatalytic degradation process by magnetic force. The as-prepared composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and magnetic property measurement system (MPMS). The photocatalytic activities were evaluated by degradation of methylene blue (MB) aqueous solution under visible light (\u03bb>400 nm). Photocatalyst with BiVo4Fe3G4 mass ratio of 5:1 showed the highest degradation rate up to 92.0% in 5 h, while the degradation rate with BiV04 was 72.5%. The results indicate that Fe304 acts not only as magnetic particles but also as a promoter. The photocatalyst can be easily separated by an external magnetic field and re-dispersed into aqueous solution by stirring after removal of external magnetic field. The photocatalyst can be reused three times without considerable loss of activity and the photocatalyst still has a degradation rate of 80% in 5 h.",

In this work, we report a facile impregnation method to prepare BiOCl nanosheets on rutile TiO 2  nanorod arrays on transparent conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. According to RhB photocatalytic degradation experiments, the degradation efficiency of the immobilized BiOCl/TiO 2  (denoted as BCTO-3) hybrid photocatalyst can reach 99.1% after visible light irradiation for 3\u00a0h, and its efficiency is higher than that of pure BiOCl (42.7%) and TiO 2  (44.8%), respectively. The enhancement is demonstrated to be the match of energy level between BiOCl and TiO 2 . Hence, the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs are obviously improved, which have been illustrated by the result of the photoluminescence spectra analysis and photoelectrochemical performance. Moreover, the degradation efficiency of BCTO-3 can still reach 91.7% after eight times photodegradation cycle experiments. Due to the easy recycling and excellent durability, the immobilized BCTO-3 photocatalyst is considered as a promising photocatalytic material for the removal of organic pollutants in aqueous eco-environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   50%BiOCl/BiOI/reduced graphene oxide (50%BiOCl/BiOI/rGO) composite photocatalyst was synthesized successfully by a facile one-step solvothermal route in this work. Reduction of graphene oxide (GO) took place in the process of solvothermal reaction and a new Bi-C bond between rGO and 50%BiOCl/BiOI was formed. The introduction of rGO affected the morphology of 50%BiOCl/BiOI, resulting in the transformation of 50%BiOCl/BiOI from solid microspheres to hollow microspheres. Both the introduction of rGO and formation of 50%BiOCl/BiOI hollow microspheres can facilitate the light absorption. The strong interaction between 50%BiOCl/BiOI and rGO and the electrical conductivity of rGO greatly improved the effective separation of photogenerated carriers. Hence, GOB-5 demonstrated the highest photocatalytic activity which was over twice of the pristine 50%BiOCl/BiOI in the presence of visible light. Mechanism study revealed that 50%BiOCl/BiOI generated electrons and holes in the presence of visible light, and holes together with  O 2  \u2212  generated from reduction of O 2  by electrons degraded the pollutant directly. Overall, this work provides an excellent reference to the synthesis of chemically bonded BiOX/BiOY (X, Y\u00a0=\u00a0Cl, Br, I)/rGO nanocomposite and helps to promote their applications in environmental protection and photoelectric conversion.",

The 3D-3D structure of BWO/GH composite is beneficial to light refraction and reflection, which highly improves the utilization rate of light. The synergistic effect of the 3D-3D BWO/GH composite greatly enhanced the removal rates of organic pollutants and it is ease of separation and recycling in water purification. The removal rate of methylene blue (MB) by BWO/GH composite is about 2.3 times as that of the pure BWO in static systems, and the removal rates of MB and 2, 4-dichlorophenol (2, 4-CDP) are about 1.3 and 3 times as these of the pure BWO in dynamic system. When the irradiation time lasted for 74\u00a0h, the removal rate of MB is nearly unchanged and still kept at 36.1%, indicating that the 3D BWO/GH composite has a high stability. The construction of BWO/GH composite resolved the adsorption saturation problem of GH and improved the photocatalytic activity of BWO, thus greatly improved the removal rate of water pollutants.",

Keywords Polyoxometalate Imido complex DCC Nitro group Crystal structure 1 Introduction Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a unique class of inorganic clusters made up of early transition metal cations in their high oxidation states bridged by oxide anions with unique photonic, electronic, magnetic properties, chemical reactivity and remarkable self-assembly properties that has promised dramatic applications in quite diverse disciplines, including catalysis, medicine and materials sciences [1\u201314] . The surface modification of POMs through covalently bonded organic species affords a convenient and effective way to generate novel organic/inorganic hybrid materials with their fascinating properties, resulting from synergistic effects between the organic and inorganic segments [15] . Thanks largely to the pioneering work of Maatta [16,17] , Proust [18] and Errington [19,20] , organoimido derivatives have gained more and more interest inasmuch as the organic \u03c0-electrons may extend their conjugation into the inorganic framework, remarkably modifying the electronic structures and redox properties of the parent POM components [21,22] . At present, there have been three types of reactions to synthesize the organoimido derivatives of POMs, including reactions with phosphinimines, isocyanates and aromatic\u00a0amines [16\u201320] . However, it is very difficult to prepare organoimido derivatives of POMs bearing an electron-withdrawing group in reasonable yield and high purity using the three approaches mentioned above. Recently, Wei and co-workers have developed a DCC protocol to yield the organoimido functionalized POMs by using N , N \u2032-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) as a dehydrating agent [23] . As reported, Wei\u2019s \u201cmonofunctionalization route\u201d, that is, a refluxing reaction of (Bu 4 N) 4 [\u03b1-Mo 8 O 26 ], aromatic amine hydrochlorides and DCC in acetonitrile, can selectively result in monofunctionalized arylimido derivatives bearing various electron-withdrawing groups, including chloroanilimido, bromoanilimido, p -nitroanilimido and m -nitroanilimido [24\u201326] . Nevertheless, bifunctionalized arylimido derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups have rarely been reported except the only one example of an organoimido hexamolybdate derivative containing a remote trifluoromethyl group, which was prepared by Wei et\u00a0al. via the \u201cbifunctionalization route\u201d [27] (a reaction of (Bu 4 N) 4 [\u03b1-Mo 8 O 26 ], aromatic amines and DCC selectively affording the bifunctionalized arylimido derivatives [28] ). Up to date, well-defined structurally characterized examples of bifunctionalized arylimido derivatives of hexamolybdates bearing a nitro group have never been synthesized successfully due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, which results in the bifunctionalization route being very difficult to accomplish. Herein we report a nitro functionalized organoimido-disubstituted POM derivative, (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 17 (N\u2013 o -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 ) 2 ] ( 1 ). Other than the popular bifunctionalization route resulting in bifunctionalized organoimido derivatives of hexamolybdates only without electron-withdrawing groups [28] , we have employed a new route using (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 19 ], 2\u00a0equivalent of aromatic amines and an excessive dehydrating agent DCC to synthesize bifunctionalized arylimido derivatives of hexamolybdates bearing the strong electron-withdrawing nitro group. Additionally, we have unexpectedly obtained a new nitro functionalized mono-organoimido derivative (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 18 (N\u2013 o -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 )] ( 2 ) via such a route by controlling the excessive amount of DCC. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to prepare monosubstituted POM derivatives bearing strong electron-withdrawing groups via a non-\u201cmonofunctionalization route\u201d. Thus, the new route is applicable for synthesis of both mono- and bi-functionalized imido hexamolybdates bearing electron-withdrawing groups and it provides a new access to prepare such complexes. Moreover, since nitro is one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry with various well-defined transformations, the as-prepared two derivatives provide us a chance to investigate the reaction chemistry of such organically functionalized POMs for the preparation of more novel hybrid materials. 2 Experimental All syntheses and manipulations were performed in the open air. DCC, acetone, ethanol and ethyl ether were used as received. Acetonitrile was dried by refluxing in the presence of CaH 2 and was distilled prior to use. (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 19 ] was synthesized according to an improved literature method [29] and was recrystallized from anhydrous acetone and dried before use. O -nitroaniline was also dried before use. UV/vis spectra were recorded in DMF with a TU-1810 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin\u2013Elmer 2400 series \u2161 CHNS/O analyzer. IR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer using KBr pellets. 1 H NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker ARX 400 NMR spectrometer at 298\u00a0K using d 6 -DMSO as a solvent. The mass spectra were recorded using an ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermofisher LTQ). Negative mode was used for the experiment (capillary voltage 33\u00a0V). Sample solution (in acetonitrile) was infused into the ESI source at a flow rate of 300\u00a0\u03bcL/min. 2.1 Synthesis of compound 1 A mixture of (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 19 ] (1.0\u00a0mmol, 1.37\u00a0g), o -nitroaniline (2.1\u00a0mmol, 0.29\u00a0g), and DCC (3.4\u00a0mmol, 0.70\u00a0g) was refluxed in anhydrous acetonitrile (15\u00a0ml) at the refluxing temperature for about 12\u00a0h. While the reaction mixture dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile with the temperature arising, the solution turned yellow. During the course of reaction, its color changed to orange-red, and some white precipitates ( N , N \u2032-dicyclohexylurea) formed. When the resulting orange-red solution was cooled down to room temperature, the white precipitates were removed by filtration. The acetonitrile evaporated to give viscous oil. This orange-red oil was then washed with ethanol for several times and the residue (0.55\u00a0g, yield 34.5%) was resolved in acetonitrile. Crystals of 1 were obtained by diffusion of Et 2 O into their solution in acetonitrile. Elemental Anal Calcd (%) for C 44 H 80 Mo 6 N 6 O 21 : C, 32.93; N, 5.24; H, 5.02.

ESI-mass spectrometry (MeCN, m / z ): 1241.7 and 500.7 were attributed to [Bu 4 N][Mo 6 O 18 (N\u2013 o -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 )] \u2212 and [Mo 6 O 18 (N\u2013 o -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 )] 2\u2212 , respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis The reaction of (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 19 ] and 2\u00a0equivalent of o -nitroaniline with excessive DCC as dehydrating agent in anhydrous acetonitrile selectively affords mono- and bi-functionalized organoimido derivatives of hexamolybdate bearing the electron-withdrawing functional group NO 2 , respectively, by controlling the excessive amount of the dehydrating agent DCC (see Scheme 1 ). When using 2\u00a0equivalent of DCC, this reaction affords the monofunctionalized derivative containing the ortho nitro group (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 18 (N\u2013 o -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 )] ( 2 ). Compared to the Wei\u2019s \u201cmonofunctionalization route\u201d [24] , such a reaction presents an alternative approach to prepare mono-functionalized imido hexamolybdates bearing strong electron-withdrawing groups. However, with the addition of more DCC, for instance, 3.4\u00a0equivalent of DCC, this reaction gives the bifunctionalized derivative bearing nitro groups (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 17 (N\u2013 o -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 ) 2 ] ( 1 ), which has never been prepared via the popular bifunctionalization route developed by Wei et\u00a0al. due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group. Relative to the \u201cbifunctionalization route\u201d resulting in bifunctionalized imido hexamolybdates only without electron-withdrawing groups [28] , such a reaction provides an access to synthesize bifunctionalized organic derivatives of POMs bearing remote electron-withdrawing groups. In both reactions, the amount of DCC is largely higher than that of the water needed to be removed from the reaction system. As it is revealed in the previous reports, DCC may serve as not only a dehydrating agent but also an activating agent with an activating effect on the terminal Mo\u2013O bond [24] . Thus, since the nitro group decreases the nucleophilicity of o -nitroaniline due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature, an excessive DCC can dramatically facilitate the reaction of [Mo 6 O 19 ] 2\u2212 with such aromatic amines and finally results in the as-prepared mono- and bi-functionalized derivatives. 3.2 X-ray structural studies Summaries of crystallographic data with data collection and refinement parameters are given in Table\u00a01 . Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table\u00a02 . A suitable single-crystal having approximate dimensions 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.3\u00a0mm 3 for 1 and 0.40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.15\u00a0mm 3 for 2 was mounted on a glass fiber, respectively. Measurements for 1 and 2 were made on a Rigaku RAXIS-RAPID CCD diffractometer. Data collection were performed at 293\u00a0K by using graphite-monochromated Mo K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb \u00a0=\u00a00.71073\u00a0\u00c5). Subsequent calculations were carried out using SHELXTL 5.01 program. Both structures were solved by the direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares method on F 2 . All of the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically and the hydrogen atoms were included at their calculated positions without refinement. Fig.\u00a01 shows the ORTEP viewing and atomic labeling scheme of the cluster anions within compounds 1 and 2 . Structure of 1 exhibits features of bi-imido hexamolybdates. The two arylimido ligands are bound to two terminal positions of the hexamolybdate cluster in a cis fashion. Similar to those reported mono-imido hexamolybdates [23\u201326] , the distances between the Mo atom bearing the arylimido ligand and the central oxygen atom within the cluster anion cage, Mo(1)\u2013O(1) (2.222\u00a0\u00c5) and Mo(3)\u2013O(1) (2.236\u00a0\u00c5), are both significantly shorter than the other Mo\u2013O(1) distances, due to the trans -effect. The short Mo\u2013N bond distances of 1.743(6) and 1.739(6)\u00a0\u00c5 and the almost linear C\u2013N\u2013Mo bond angles (C(1)\u2013N(1)\u2013Mo(3), 178.7\u00b0 and C(11)\u2013N(2)\u2013Mo(1), 170.8\u00b0) are also in good agreement with the Mo N triple bond character. Compared to the hexamolybdate parent and other corresponding derivatives, the bond lengths of the four terminal oxo ligands of 1 do not vary remarkably. Additionally, similar to the reported derivatives, the imido-bearing molybdenum atom demonstrates weaker electropositivity than other molybdenum atoms as one consequence of coordination with an electron-donating organoimido ligand, and therefore the bond lengths of Mo a \u2013O b (O b is the bridge oxygen ligand) are longer than that of Mo b \u2013O b . Structure of 2 shows features of mono-imido hexamolybdates. The arylimido group is bound on a terminal position at the hexamolybdate cluster in a monodentate fashion. The central oxygen atom inside the cluster cage is drawn significantly closer to the imido-bearing Mo atom. The bond length of Mo(6)\u2013O(21), compared to that of Mo(2)\u2013O(21), is shorter by 0.128\u00a0\u00c5 because of the so-called \u201c trans influence\u201d. Compared to the hexamolybdate parent and other reported derivatives, the bond lengths of the five terminal oxo ligands of 1 do not vary significantly. The short Mo\u2013N bond lengths (1.749\u00a0\u00c5) and the nearly linear C\u2013N\u2013Mo bond angles close to 180\u00b0 (166\u00b0) are typical of organoimido groups bonded at an octahedral d 0 metal center and are consistent with a substantial degree of Mo N triple bond character. Similar to 1 , the bond lengths of Mo a \u2013O b (O b is the bridge oxygen ligand) are longer than that of Mo b \u2013O b . Besides the different molecular structures, the solid state structure features are also different due to the different [NAr] incorporation numbers. Each cluster anion of 1 is connected to one neighboring cluster via one hydrogen bonding interaction (C(14)\u2013H(14)\u22efO(3A)), forming a supramolecular chain, which is shown in Fig.\u00a02 . However, for the cluster anions of 2 , there is an interesting structural feature that there are two hydrogen bonding interactions (C(5)\u2013H(5)\u22efO(41A), C(5A)\u2013H(5A)\u22efO(40)) in the solid state structure, which form a 10-membered ring and result in dimer-like aggregates(see Fig.\u00a03 ). 3.3 Electronic spectroscopy Fig.\u00a04 shows the UV/vis absorption spectra of the tetrabutylammonium salt of [Mo 6 O 19 ] 2\u2212 , 1 and 2 . The lowest energy electronic transition at 325\u00a0nm in [Mo 6 O 19 ] 2\u2212 is assigned to a charge-transfer transition from the oxygen \u03c0-type HOMO to the molybdenum \u03c0-type LUMO, which is bathochromically shifted significantly and becomes considerably more intense in 1 (384\u00a0nm) and 2 (368\u00a0nm), respectively, due to the charge-transfer transition from the coordination N atom to molybdenum atom (LMCT), indicating that the Mo\u2013N \u03c0 bond is formed and the delocalization of organic conjugated \u03c0-electrons has extended from the benzene ring to the hexamolybdate skeleton in accord with Mulliken theory [30,31] . In other words, there is a strong electronic interaction between the metal-oxygen cluster and the conjugated organic ligand. Table\u00a03 shows the comparison of the lowest energy electronic transition peaks of compounds 1 , 2 and other arylimido functionalized hexamolybdates. In comparison with reported (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 18 (N\u2013 o -CH 3 \u2013C 6 H 4 )] and (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 17 (N\u2013 o -CH 3 \u2013C 6 H 4 ) 2 ] [32] , the lowest energy electronic transition of 2 and 1 are bathochromically shifted by 12 and 22\u00a0nm, respectively. Moreover, relative to (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 17 (N\u2013 o -OCH 3 \u2013C 6 H 4 ) 2 ] bearing the strong electron-donating methoxyl at the ortho position [33] , the lowest energy electronic transition of 2 is still red-shifted by 18\u00a0nm. These phenomena may arise from the fact that the nitro group at the ortho position enlarges the electronic delocalization range of the benzene ring. Compared to the reported (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 18 (N\u2013 m -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 )] [25] , the charge-transfer transition of 2 is red-shifted by 20\u00a0nm because of the strong conjugated substituent effects of ortho position, indicating the position of the nitro group on the benzene ring has a dramatic effect on the L\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M charge-transfer transition. Additionally, as for the both structures, the bathochromic shift on going from 2 (368\u00a0nm) to 1 (384\u00a0nm) is consistent with the increasing [NAr] incorporation. Compared with the red-shift of ca 4\u00a0nm between other mono- and bi-arylimido series with the same [NAr] ligand reported in the literature [30] , the red-shift increases to 16\u00a0nm between 2 and 1 , which may also result from the enhanced conjugated substituent effect of the nitro group at the ortho position. 3.4 IR spectroscopy The IR spectra of compounds 1 and 2 are similar to each other, except for the bands of hexamolybdate framework. In the IR spectrum of their hexamolybdate parent, two strong peaks of Mo\u2013O t and Mo\u2013O b \u2013Mo appear at 957 and 798\u00a0cm \u22121 , respectively. As for compound 2 , the spectrum resembles those of previously reported mono-organoimido derivatives, showing the typical \u03bd (Mo\u2013O b \u2013Mo), \u03bd (Mo\u2013O t ) and \u03bd (Mo N) vibrations at 796, 954\u00a0cm \u22121 and 975\u00a0cm \u22121 as a shoulder, respectively [33] . However, as for compound 1 , the spectrum differs from those of bi-organoimido derivatives to some extent. Although the typical strong shoulder peak at 968\u00a0cm \u22121 of bi-organoimido substitution in previous reports is observed in compound 1 , the stretching vibration of Mo\u2013O b \u2013Mo and Mo\u2013O t respectively at 945 and 775\u00a0cm \u22121 in the reported bifunctionalized derivatives shift to 951 and 781\u00a0cm \u22121 [34] . The increases may result from the electron-drawing nature of nitro group, which leads to the decrease of electrons of Mo\u2013O \u03c0 \u2217 -bond and the strengthening of Mo\u2013O bond. It is obvious that the stretching vibrations of Mo N, Mo O t , and Mo\u2013O b \u2013Mo have an increasing red-shift with the increase of [NAr] incorporation. As for organoimido ligands, the characteristic vibrations of both compounds are identical. The aromatic \u03b3 (Ar\u2013H) bands (\u03b3\u00a0>\u00a03000\u00a0cm \u22121 ) in the high-frequency region are hardly visible, due to their low intensity. Other bands in the medium-frequency region can be easily attributed to \u03bd (C\u2013H), \u03bd (C\u2013C) and \u03bd (C C). In addition, the very strong bands at 1527, 1334\u00a0cm \u22121 in 1 and 1525, 1337\u00a0cm \u22121 in 2 represent the typical \u03bd (N O) vibration. 3.5 1 H NMR spectroscopy The 1 H NMR spectra (in d 6 -DMSO) of compounds 1 and 2 show clearly resolved signals, all of which can be unambiguously assigned. The integration of the peaks matches well with the assumed structures. Table\u00a04 shows the chemical shifts of aromatic protons of compounds 1 , 2 and the corresponding free amine ligands. Compared to the corresponding free amines, the aromatic protons of 1 and 2 exhibit significantly downfield chemical shifts, indicating the much weaker shielding nature of the [Mo 5 O 18 (Mo N \u2212 )] 2\u2212 than the amino group. However, owing to the accumulation effect of electron density, the electron-drawing ability of functionalized hexamolybdates cluster shows a step-down trend with the increase of [NAr] incorporation. Therefore, the aromatic protons of the disubstituted derivative (compound 1 ) demonstrate a slight upfield shift compared with those of the corresponding monosubstituted derivative (compound 2 ). 3.6 ESI-mass spectrometry Compounds 1 and 2 have also been characterized by ESI-mass spectrometry. For compound 1 , there are two major isotopic clusters, centered at m / z 1362.7 and 560.7, confirming the bifunctionalization. These signals are all well-defined. The signal at m / z 1362.7 is due to the aggregate between the cluster anion and one [Bu 4 N] + cation, [Bu 4 N][Mo 6 O 17 (N\u2013 o -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 ) 2 ] \u2212 (calcd m / z :1362.3), while the signal at m / z 560.7 is assigned to [Mo 6 O 17 (N\u2013 o -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 ) 2 ] 2\u2212 (calcd m / z :559.9). Similarly, the signals for compound 2 at m / z 1241.7 and 500.7 were attributed to [Bu 4 N][Mo 6 O 18 (N\u2013 o -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 )] \u2212 (calcd m / z :1242.2) and [Mo 6 O 18 (N\u2013 o -NO 2 \u2013C 6 H 4 )] 2\u2212 (calcd m / z :499.9), respectively. 4 Conclusions In summary, two novel mono- and bi-functionalized imido hexamolybdates bearing the strong electron-withdrawing nitro group have been prepared in high purity and moderate yields via a reaction of (Bu 4 N) 2 [Mo 6 O 19 ], 2\u00a0equivalent of aromatic amines and an excessive DCC. Such a new synthetic route provides an access to prepare arylimido derivatives of hexamolybdates bearing even strong electron-withdrawing groups. Both of the two derivatives have been characterized by UV/vis, IR, 1 H NMR, ESI and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. UV and IR studies reveal that the lowest energy electronic transition and the significant stretching vibration (Mo N, Mo O t and Mo\u2013O b \u2013Mo) have an increasing red-shift with the increase of [NAr] incorporation. 1 H NMR studies imply the electron-drawing ability of functionalized hexamolybdates cluster shows a step-down trend with the increase of [NAr] incorporation. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies indicate that the increase of [NAr] incorporation has great influence on the supermolecular structures of hexamolybdate derivatives in the solid state.

BiPO 4  film has performed a superior PEC degradation ability with synergetic effect of electro-oxidation and photocatalysis. The degradation rate of Methyl Blue (MB) increased greatly as bias potential increased and the highest activity was achieved at the bias potential of 3.0\u00a0V (vs. SCE in 0.1\u00a0mol/L Na 2 SO 4 , pH\u00a0=\u00a07). The PEC activity of BiPO 4  film is 5 times and 15 times higher than that of photocatalytic degradation and electrochemical oxidation, respectively. The acid condition plays an important role in achieving effective photoelectrocatalysis. The PEC degradation rate was also affected by the adsorption and the oxidation reaction of the ions of electrolytes. This BiPO 4  film could open up new opportunities to develop high-performance photoanode for PEC degradation.",

        "abstract": " A facial method was used to fabricate BiOI/BiOCl film at room temperature.30% BiOI/BiOCl showed an excellent photocatalytic activity and stability.Improvement of photocatalytic activity was owed to expanded visible light absorption and high separation efficiency of charge. Photocatalysis has been considered to be one of the most promising ways to photodegrade organic pollutants. Herein, a series of BiOI/BiOCl films coating on FTO were fabricated through a simple method at room temperature. The photocatalytic efficiency of 30%BiOI/BiOCl could reach more than 99% aiming to degrading RhB and MB after 90 and 120 min, respectively. Compared with BiOCl, 30%BiOI/BiOCl showed 12 times higher efficiency when degrading RhB. In comparison with BiOI, 30%BiOI/BiOCl showed 5 and 6 times higher efficiency when degrading RhB and MB, respectively. These obvious enhancements were attributed to expanded visible light absorption and high separation performance of photoinduced charge. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of 30%BiOI/BiOCl had no obvious decrease after five recycles, suggesting that it was a promising photocatalyst for the removal of MB and RhB pollutants. Finally, the possible growth process for the BiOI/BiOCl thin films and photocatalysis mechanism were investigated in details. This work would provide insight to the reasonable construction of BiOX heterojunction and the photocatalytic mechanism in degrading organic pollutants.",

In visible-light photocatalytically degrading Rhodamine B (RhB) experiments, 2 wt% GO/BiOCl could degrade 99% of RhB within 1.5 h and the rate constant was 12.2 times higher than that of pure BiOCl. The degradation efficiency still kept at 80% even after 4 recycles, evidencing the relatively good recyclability. The enhancement was attributed to the improvement of visible light adsorption and charge separation. Holes and superoxide radicals\u00b7  played a major role as reactive species. The values of conduction band and valence band for GO and BiOCl were calculated and a new photocatalytic mechanism of GO/BiOCl nanocomposite was proposed.",

With the increase of La(OH) content, the adsorption capacity for phosphate increased while the magnetic property decreased. La10-MC exhibited excellent magnetic property for easy recovery and high adsorption capacity up to 101.16\u202fmg P/g, which was 27 times that of pineapple biochar and much higher than most phosphate adsorbents. Adsorption isotherm and adsorption kinetics were better fitted by Langmuir model and pseudo second-order model, respectively. The removal efficiency >96.04% in coexisting ions indicated its high selectivity to phosphate. Little decrease in removal efficiency after three adsorption-desorption cycles suggested its excellent stability and cyclic utilization. Leaching study demonstrated the negligible risk of La and Fe leakage during adsorption process. Mechanism study revealed that the adsorption mechanism involved precipitation, electrostatic interaction, ligand exchange and inner-sphere complexation.",

The crystalline structures, morphologies, optical properties, and photocatalytic properties were studied. The results showed that the CDs/BiOCl films exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than pure BiOCl. The 4 wt% CDs/BiOCl film showed the best photocatalytic activity, which was about eight times than that of pure BiOCl and excellent recyclability even after four recycles. Compared with other film photocatalysts, the photocatalytic activity of 4 wt% CDs/BiOCl was also higher than that of many other photocatalysts. The enhanced activity was ascribed to the enhanced light adsorption and the improvement of charge separation. Holes and superoxide radicals \u00b7O2 \u2212 were revealed as the dominant reactive species. The photocatalytic mechanism was proposed based on the results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Three-dimensional (3D) porous networkstructural BiOI-graphene hydrogel-FTO (BiOI/GH/FTO) electrode with remarkably superior photoelectrocatalytic degradation activity and photoelectrocatalytic mineralization ability was successfully prepared by a two-step electrodeposition method. The BiOI nanosheets were electrodeposited into the architectures of 3D porous graphene hydrogel which was prepared by the electrochemical reduction of GO in aqueous dispersion. The morphology and amount of BiOI can be controlled by the electrochemical deposition. With the deposition time of BiOI for 60\u202fs and the working voltage at 1.0\u202fV, the photoelectrocatalytic activity of the 3D BiOI/GH/FTO achieved to the maximum. The removal rate of phenol can be up to about 83% in 5\u202fh, which was 13.8 times higher than that of BiOI/FTO electrode. The degradation rate and mineralization rate of phenol in the solution absence of Na 2 SO 4  electrolyte were 76.8% and 56.8%, respectively, which were 13.2 times and 33.4 times as high as that of the BiOI/FTO. The enhanced photoelectrocatalytic degradation activity of 3D BiOI/GH/FTO is due to the 3D porous architecture and a larger surface area of graphene hydrogel which is favorable for reactant diffusion, and the superior electrical conductivity which promotes the charges to transfer excited by BiOI. The BiOI/GH/FTO electrode has the excellent stability. The degradation rates of phenol nearly unchanged after 4 cyclic degradations in static system and a long-term degradation for 72\u202fh in dynamical system. Trapping experiment shows that the hole might be the main active species in photoelectrocatalytic degradation. This research provides new insights in the development of a new photoelectrocatalytic material for the removal of organic compound.",

Ferrous salt works as catalyst for graphitization, without which amorphous carbon is resulted. The graphitic carbon ribbons and amorphous carbon are compared in detail in morphology, crystalline structure, defects, nitrogen groups and ORR activity by means of SEM, TEM, Raman, XRD, XPS and electrochemical characterizations. It is found the nitrogen doped graphitic carbon ribbons has comparable ORR activity with Pt/C catalyst in alkaline medium, which is much better than nitrogen doped amorphous carbon. The improved ORR activity is ascribed to the nitrogen group introduced by NH 3  treatment of graphitic carbon. The as prepared material can work as efficient non noble metal catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction.",

The physical and chemical properties of the catalyst were characterized in detail. The catalyst simultaneously catalyzed esterification and transesterification reactions to produce biodiesel from high free fatty acid (FFA) containing oils (55.2\u00a0%). For the as-prepared catalyst, 90.82\u00a0% of the oleic acid was esterified after 8\u00a0h, while the total transesterification yield of high FFA containing oils reached 79.98\u00a0% after 12\u00a0h. By contrast, the obtained catalyst showed comparable activity to biomass (such as sugar, starch, etc.)-based carbon solid acid catalyst while Amberlyst-15 resulted in significantly lower levels of conversion, demonstrating its relatively high catalytic activity for simultaneous esterification and transesterification. Moreover, as the catalyst can be regenerated, it has the potential for use in biodiesel production from oils with a high FFA content.",

        "abstract": "High-quality BiOCl with {001} facets were successfully synthesized via a facile solvothermal method by controlling the volume ratio of ethanol (ET) and ethylene glycol (EG). The diameters of BiOCl nanosheets with {001} facets varied from 600 to 50 nm with the increase of EG content while the thickness nearly remained the same (\u223c20 nm). In the meantime, the morphologies of BiOCl turned into 3D hierarchical microspheres from 2D nanosheets. The 91.84 % {001} facets-exposed BiOCl nanosheets with diameter of 300\u2013600 nm exhibited the best photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation on account of the strong adsorption property of the effective electron injection as well as the sequent reactive radical formation. More importantly, the RhB-sensitized BiOCl nanosheets showed effective photocatalytic property for breaking down methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) while RhB keeping almost intact until MB and MO had been photodegraded. It was found that the sensitizer radical cation (\u00b7RhB+) could react with MB and MO and their suitable redox potential confirms that as well. These findings may provide a promising approach method for synthesizing other metal oxyhalide materials with controllable diameters of nanosheets and deepen our comprehending for the role of the semiconductor in the sensitization process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Immobilized CdS/BiOCl film photocatalysts were successfully synthesized by a facile two-step hydrothermal-hydrolysis method. The structures, morphologies, photocatalytic properties and reusabilities of the samples were studied. The photocatalytic activities of CdS/BiOCl were significantly improved compared with pure BiOCl. The photocatalytic activity of 6% CdS/BiOCl was the highest and 10 times higher than pure BiOCl, which was attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption and the higher separation of photogenerated carriers. Besides, 6% CdS/BiOCl also showed good recycling performance. A new photocatalytic mechanism, totally different from other mechanisms of BiOCl-based heterostructures, was revealed. It was part of electrons on the conducting band of CdS rather than the transferred electrons on the conducting band of BiOCl that oxidized O 2  into  O 2  \u2212 , and  O 2  \u2212  together with h +  on the valence band of CdS degraded organic pollutants. BiOCl did not generate electrons and holes, but only served as the electron transferer as electrons on the conducting band of CdS transferred to the conducting band of BiOCl, facilitating the separation of hole-electron pairs. This work provided a good reference for design and synthesis of film photocatalysts and new insights into photocatalytic mechanisms for heterostructures.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes and vascular calcification are intrinsically linked. We previously reported that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accelerate calcium deposition in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) via excessive oxidative stress. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) is an important mitochondrial matrix enzyme in cellular energy metabolism. Since hyperactivation of PDK4 has been reported in calcified vessels and in patients with diabetes mellitus, inhibition of PDK4 expression may be a strategy for the prevention of diabetic vascular calcification. In this study, we used a rat VSMC model to investigate the role of PDK4 in diabetic vascular calcification and further explore the underlying mechanisms. We observed that N\u03b5-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), which is a major immunogen of AGEs, accelerated calcium deposition in VSMCs through PDK4 activation. An elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) acted as a signal transduction intermediate to increase PDK4 expression. Either inhibition of PDK4 expression or RAGE (receptor for AGEs) blockade attenuated CML-induced VSMC calcification, as shown by decreased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Glucose consumption and lactate production were increased during CML-induced VSMC calcification. Importantly, CML accelerates glycolysis in VSMCs via a PDK4-dependent pathway. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which CML promotes VSMC calcification via PDK4 activation and alters glucose metabolism in VSMCs.",

        "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is widely linked to lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, but its effects on coronary artery disease (CAD) are not clearly elucidated. The aim of this study was to clarify the association between  gene polymorphisms and CAD susceptibility. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to estimate the strength of the relationship between  gene polymorphisms and CAD risk. Comprehensive electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, were systematically searched. A total of 45 records containing 80 eligible studies were analyzed. The results indicated an increased risk between the  D9N polymorphism and susceptibility to CAD in the dominant genetic model (AA + GA vs. GG: OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.14-1.87), whereas the  HindIII polymorphism showed a protective effect against CAD under all tested models (GG+GT vs. TT: OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75-0.97; GG vs. TT + TG: OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.47-0.83; G vs. T: OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.71-0.92). No significant association was identified for the  N291S and PvuII polymorphisms. Stratification analysis by ethnicity suggested a significant correlation between the  S447X polymorphism and CAD susceptibility in Caucasians under the dominant and allele genetic models. In summary, our meta-analysis indicated that the  D9N polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of CAD, whereas the S447X and HindIII polymorphisms showed protective effects. There was no association observed between the N291S and PvuII polymorphisms and CAD risk.",

        "title": "Restoring mitochondrial biogenesis with metformin attenuates \u03b2-GP-induced phenotypic transformation of VSMCs into an osteogenic phenotype via inhibition of PDK4/oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis.",
        "abstract": "Mitochondrial abnormalities have long been observed in the development of vascular calcification. Metformin, a member of the biguanide class of antidiabetic drugs, has recently received attention owing to new findings regarding its protective role in cardiovascular disease. Since the precise control of mitochondrial quantity and quality is critical for the survival and function of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis may be a potential protective factor for VSMCs against osteoblast-like phenotypic transition. However, limited studies have been reported in this area. Here, we investigated the role of metformin in the phenotypic transformation of VSMCs, as well as its intracellular signal transduction pathways. We demonstrated that supplementation with metformin restored the \u03b2-glycerophosphate (\u03b2-GP)-mediated impairment of mitochondrial biogenesis in VSMCs, as evidenced by an increased mitochondrial DNA copy number, a restored mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and upregulated mitochondrial biogenesis-related gene expression, whereas the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C suppressed these effects. We also observed that overexpression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), an important mitochondrial matrix enzyme in cellular energy metabolism, exacerbated \u03b2-GP-induced oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis in VSMCs but that these effects were suppressed by dichloroacetate, a widely reported PDK4 inhibitor. More importantly, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis attenuated the \u03b2-GP-induced phenotypic transformation of VSMCs into an osteogenic phenotype through inhibition of the PDK4/oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis pathway, whereas disruption of mitochondrial biogenesis by zidovudine aggravated \u03b2-GP-induced apoptosis in VSMCs. In addition, inhibition of autophagy by small interfering RNA targeting Atg5 reduced mitochondrial biogenesis in VSMCs. In summary, we uncovered a novel mechanism by which metformin attenuates the phenotypic transformation of VSMCs into an osteogenic phenotype via inhibition of the PDK4/oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis pathway, and mitochondrial homeostasis is involved in this process.",

        "abstract": "Arterial media calcification is associated with diabetes mellitus. Previous studies have shown that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are responsible for vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), one of the major factors during hypoxia, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), an important mitochondrial matrix enzyme in cellular metabolism shift, have been reported in VSMC calcification. The potential link among HIF-1\u03b1, PDK4, and AGEs-induced vascular calcification was investigated in this study. We observed that AGEs elevated HIF-1\u03b1 and PDK4 expression levels in a dose-dependent manner and that maximal stimulation was attained at 24\u2009h. Two important HIF-1\u03b1-regulated genes, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), were significantly increased after AGEs exposure. Stabilization or nuclear translocation of HIF-1\u03b1 increased PDK4 expression. PDK4 inhibition attenuated AGEs-induced VSMC calcification, which was evaluated by measuring the calcium content, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression levels and by Alizarin red S staining. In addition, the glucose consumption, lactate production, key enzymes of glucose metabolism and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were decreased during AGEs-induced VSMC calcification. In conclusion, this study suggests that AGEs accelerate vascular calcification partly through the HIF-1\u03b1/PDK4 pathway and suppress glucose metabolism.",

        "abstract": " The osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMCs) is important for the development of vascular calcification (VC), particularly in diabetes. Exosomes derived from Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) are effective against cardiovascular diseases, yet their role in VC remains unclear. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) inhibit bone marrow stromal cell osteogenesis by targeting osteogenesis-associated genes. Thus, we investigated the role of exosomes derived from MSCs pretreated with AGEs-BSA in VC and its potential mechanisms.  Primary VSMCs and MSCs were isolated from the aorta and bone marrow of Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively. VSMCs were cultured with AGEs-BSA to induce osteogenic differentiation. Exosomes were harvested from MSCs by ultracentrifugation. MSCs and VSMCs were cocultured in Transwells, and exosomes were added to VSMC culture medium to assess their effects on osteogenic differentiation. Double luciferase reporter assay was applied to confirm that miR-146a directly targets the 3' UTR of the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) gene.  Pretreatment of VSMCs with AGEs-BSA increased the expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) by inhibiting that of miR-146a, resulting in enhanced ROS production and VSMC calcification. By contrast, the expression of miR-146a in MSCs was increased by AGEs-BSA treatment. Thus, miR-146a was transferred from AGEs-BSA-pretreated or miR-146a-transfected MSCs to VSMCs via exosomes. After coculture with miR-146a-containing exosomes, the AGEs-BSA-mediated increase in VSMC calcification was diminished, accompanied by decreased TXNIP expression and ROS production. Furthermore, TXNIP overexpression counteracted the anti-calcification effects of MSC-derived miR-146a-containing exosomes. In addition, TXNIP was identified as a target gene of miR-146a, and the results of double luciferase reporter assay confirmed that TXNIP was the direct target gene of miR-146a.  Exosomes secreted by MSCs pretreated with AGEs-BSA contained a high level of miR-146a, which was transferred to VSMCs and inhibited AGEs-BSA-induced calcification in a TXNIP-dependent manner. Thus, miR-146a-containing exosomes may be a potential therapeutic target for VC.",

        "abstract": "Although cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, inconsistent results have been published in the literature on its impacts on the cardiovascular health of patients after coronary revascularization with a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). We performed a comprehensive electronic database search through July 2018. Studies reporting the risk estimates of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients after coronary revascularization with PCI or CABG on the basis of smoking status were selected. Multivariate-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models with inverse variance weighting. Data from 37 records including 126\u2009901 participants were finally collected. Overall, the pooled RR (95% CI) associated with cigarette smoking was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.09-1.47) for all-cause mortality, 1.08 (95% CI: 0.92-1.28) for major adverse cardiovascular events, 0.96 (95% CI: 0.69-1.35) for cardiovascular mortality and 1.15 (95% CI: 0.81-1.64) for myocardial infarction. The increased risk of all-cause mortality was also observed in former smokers compared with those who had never smoked (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03-1.38). Furthermore, the negative effects of cigarette smoking on all-cause mortality were also observed in most subgroups. Cigarette smoking has been shown to increase the likelihood of all-cause mortality in patients after coronary revascularization with PCI or CABG. Smoking cessation is essential for PCI or CABG patients to manage their coronary artery disease.",

Previous studies have investigated whether there was evidence of an association between polymorphisms at the X-ray repair cross complementing 1 (XRCC1) gene and susceptibility to CAD, but findings have been inconclusive. We identified eligible studies through a comprehensive literature search to determine whether an association exists between XRCC1 gene polymorphisms and CAD susceptibility. Findings were assessed using the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), which were calculated using a fixed- or random-effects model, based on the heterogeneity of the studies. Ten eligible studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. Our pooled analysis found that XRCC1 polymorphisms were significantly associated with CAD susceptibility under recessive (Arg194Trp: OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.13\u20131.93; Arg399Gln: OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.12\u20131.89), homozygous (Arg194Trp: OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.03\u20131.81; Arg399Gln: OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.19\u20132.05), and allele (Arg399Gln: OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.06\u20131.32) genetic models. Following subgroup analysis by ethnicity, in Asian populations, we found evidence of associations between the XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism and CAD under recessive and homozygous genetic models, and between the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and CAD under recessive, homozygous, and allele genetic models. Subgroup analysis stratified by control source revealed associations between the Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphisms and susceptibility to CAD under recessive and homozygous modes of inheritance, respectively. In addition, subgroup analysis stratified by sample size found that findings of the Arg194Trp polymorphism in large sample sizes were comparable to those found using pooled eligible studies. Based on our meta-analysis, we concluded that the XRCC1 gene polymorphisms, Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln, are associated with CAD susceptibility, specifically in Asian populations. However, additional, comprehensive and well-designed studies are warranted to confirm these findings.",

        "abstract": "Arterial media calcification is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus, which is related to oxidative stress and apoptosis. Mitophagy is a special regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis and takes control of intracellular ROS generation and apoptotic pathways. High circulating levels of lactate usually accompanies diabetes. The potential link between lactate, mitophagy and vascular calcification is investigated in this study. Lactate treatment accelerated VSMC calcification, evaluated by measuring the calcium content, ALP activity, RUNX2, BMP-2 protein levels, and Alizarin red S staining. Lactate exposure caused excessive intracellular ROS generation and VSMC apoptosis. Lactate also impaired mitochondrial function, determined by mPTP opening rate, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial biogenesis markers. Western blot analysis of LC3-II and p62 and mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus detection for autophagy flux revealed that lactate blocked autophagy flux. LC3-II co-staining with LAMP-1 and autophagosome quantification revealed lactate inhibited autophagy. Furthermore, lactate inhibited mitophagy, which was confirmed by TOMM20 and BNIP3 protein levels, LC3-II colocalization with BNIP3 and TEM assays. In addition, BNIP3-mediated mitophagy played a protective role against VSMC calcification in the presence of lactate. This study suggests that lactate accelerates osteoblastic phenotype transition of VSMC and calcium deposition partly through the BNIP3-mediated mitophagy deficiency induced oxidative stress and apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among patients with diabetes. Endothelial dysfunction is an early physiological event in CVD. Metformin, a common oral antihyperglycemic agent, has been demonstrated to directly affect endothelial cell function. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), originally discovered in the brain as a neurotrophin, has also been reported to play a protective role in the cardiovascular system. In our study, we demonstrated that high glucose (HG) reduced cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis via changes in BDNF expression and that metformin reversed the effects of HG injury by upregulating BDNF expression. Furthermore, we found that cyclic AMP response element binding (CREB) phosphorylation was reduced in HG-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and this effect was reversed by the metformin treatment. However, the metformin effect on BDNF levels in HG-incubated HUVECs was blocked by a CREB inhibitor, which indicated that BDNF expression is regulated by metformin through CREB activation. In addition, we found that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation is involved in CREB/BDNF regulation in HG-incubated HUVECs treated with metformin and that an AMPK inhibitor impaired the protective effects of metformin on HG-treated HUVECs. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that metformin affects cell proliferation and apoptosis via the AMPK/CREB/BDNF pathway in HG-incubated HUVECs.",

Autophagy has also been found to play an important role in the process of vascular calcification. However, the potential link between AGEs, autophagy and vascular calcification is still unclear and was investigated in this study. Primary VSMCs were isolated from the thoracic aorta of Sprague Dawley rats and cultured with AGEs-BSA to induce osteogenic differentiation. VSMCs calcification was evaluated by measuring the calcium content, RUNX2 protein levels, and by Alizarin red S staining. We demonstrated that treatment of VSMCs with AGE-BSA increased the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and PDK4. AGE-BSA treatment increased LC3-II and decreased p62 protein levels. AGE-BSA exposure enhanced autophagic flux determined by mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus, induced co-localization of LC3-II and LAMP-1, and increased the number of autophagasome under TEM. HIF-1\u03b1/PDK4 pathway was activated during AGEs-induced autophagy of VSMCs. In addition, autophagy played a protective role during AGE-induced calcification of VSMCs. In conclusion, AGEs enhance autophagy via the HIF-1\u03b1/PDK4 signaling pathway, and autophagy helps attenuate AGE-induced calcification of VSMCs.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have provided evidence of associations between genetic markers at human chromosome 8q24 and an increased risk of prostate cancer. We examined whether multiple independent risk variants exist in this region and whether the strength of observed associations differs as a function of disease aggressiveness.We evaluated associations between 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 1-Mb interval at 8q24 and the risk of prostate cancer among 1563 case patients (1017 of whom had high-grade [Gleason score > or = 7] and/or non-organ-confined disease) and 576 control subjects of European American ancestry. Differences in genotype frequencies between case and control subjects were compared using logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for age, and the Wald chi-square test. All statistical tests were two-sided.We identified multiple SNPs in a 50-kb region (referred to as locus 1) that are in linkage disequilibrium with a previously reported risk-associated SNP at 8q24, rs1447295, but were more strongly associated with prostate cancer risk in our study population. We also identified a novel susceptibility SNP, rs6983267, at a second locus (locus 2) that is approximately 70 kb centromeric of rs1447295 and in linkage equilibrium with, and independent of, locus 1. Risk alleles at locus 2 were common in our study population (minor allele frequency approximately 50%, 25% homozygous for risk-associated allele). Analysis of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) prostate cancer association study database alone and in combination with our data provided further evidence for this second prostate cancer risk locus; in the combined analysis, the allele frequencies for rs6983267 differed statistically significantly between case patients and control subjects (P = 1.61 x 10(-9)). We also identified a third locus at 8q24, approximately 400 kb centromeric to locus 2, that was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer risk in a combined analysis of our data and CGEMS study data (P = 6.8 x 10(-4)). A joint analysis of loci 1 and 2 indicated that 35% of the control subjects carried risk genotypes at one or both these loci; compared with men with the non-risk genotype at both loci, men with risk genotypes at both loci had an odds ratio of prostate cancer of 2.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.62 to 4.43) and men with risk genotypes at either locus had an odds ratio of prostate cancer of 1.70 (95% CI = 1.39 to 2.07).Three loci at 8q24 are independent genetic risk factors for prostate cancer.",

We confirmed the association with a SNP in the second locus (rs11649743) in five additional populations, with P = 1.7 x 10(-9) for an allelic test of the seven studies combined. The association at each SNP remained significant after adjustment for the other SNP.",

        "abstract": "A number of TMPRSS2/ERG fusion transcripts have been reported since the discovery that recurrent genomic rearrangements result in the fusion of TMPRSS2 and ETS family member genes. In this article we present evidence demonstrating that multiple genomic alterations contribute to the formation of various TMPRSS2/ERG transcripts. Using allele-specific analysis of the data generated from the GeneChip 500K SNP array we observed both hemizygous and homozygous deletions occurring at different locations between and within TMPRSS2 and ERG in prostate cancers. The 500K SNP array enabled us to fine map the start and end of each deletion to specific introns of these two genes, and to predict a variety of fusion transcripts, including a new form which was confirmed by sequence analysis of the fusion transcripts in various tumors. We also inferred that translocation is an additional mechanism of fusion for these two genes in some tumors, based on largely diploid genomic DNA between TMPRSS and ERG, and different fusion transcripts produced in these tumors. Using a bioinformatics approach, we then uncovered the consensus sequences in the regions harboring the breakpoints of the deletions. These consensus sequences were homologous to the human Alu-Sq and Alu-Sp subfamily consensus sequences, with more than 80% homology. The presence/absence of Alu family consensus sequence in the introns of TMPRSS2 and ERG correlates with the presence/absence of fusion transcripts of theses two genes, indicating that these consensus sequences may contribute to genomic deletions and the fusion of TMPRSS2 and ERG in prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately three dozen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) consistently associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk. Despite the reproducibility of these associations, the molecular mechanism for most of these SNPs has not been well elaborated as most lie within non-coding regions of the genome. Androgens play a key role in prostate carcinogenesis. Recently, using ChIP-on-chip technology, 22,447 androgen receptor (AR) binding sites have been mapped throughout the genome, greatly expanding the genomic regions potentially involved in androgen-mediated activity.To test the hypothesis that sequence variants in AR binding sites are associated with PCa risk, we performed a systematic evaluation among two existing PCa GWAS cohorts; the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) study population. We demonstrate that regions containing AR binding sites are significantly enriched for PCa risk-associated SNPs, that is, more than expected by chance alone. In addition, compared with the entire genome, these newly observed risk-associated SNPs in these regions are significantly more likely to overlap with established PCa risk-associated SNPs from previous GWAS. These results are consistent with our previous finding from a bioinformatics analysis that one-third of the 33 known PCa risk-associated SNPs discovered by GWAS are located in regions of the genome containing AR binding sites.The results to date provide novel statistical evidence suggesting an androgen-mediated mechanism by which some PCa associated SNPs act to influence PCa risk. However, these results are hypothesis generating and ultimately warrant testing through in-depth molecular analyses.",

Mothers in the U.S. returning to work after maternity leave report difficulty with the need to take frequent breaks to pump breastmilk so many stop breastfeeding. Factors discouraging pumping breastmilk in the workplace motivated a content analysis of public comments posted in response to a legal deposition that occurred in January of 2011 in which an attorney who was a new mother was challenged about taking a break to pump breastmilk. A total of 899 public comments posted on Yahoo in 2015-2016 in response to this earlier incident were analyzed for content. Of these, only 336 mentioned breastfeeding. Overall, 148 comments showed support for breastfeeding or pumping breastmilk at work, while 182 comments showed moderate to strong disapproval (six unclassified). The majority of disapproving comments were critical of pumping breastmilk in the workplace. Implications of these findings for the duration of breastfeeding after returning to work are discussed.",

While previous research has shown that breastfeeding-related workplace policy plays a significant role in women's decision to continue breastfeeding, the extent to which interpersonal factors such as coworkers' (lack of) support and stigma affect women's breastfeeding behavior is less understood. Through a cross-sectional survey with 500 working mothers, this research found that female coworker support of other women played an important role in affecting mothers' decision to continue breastfeeding after returning to work and contributed to breastfeeding self-efficacy. The findings suggest that mothers' perception of supportive coworker communication has an impact on sustained breastfeeding. Workplaces need to enhance the mother-friendly climate by encouraging and rewarding coworkers and providing support necessary for breastfeeding colleagues.",

A cross-sectional survey of 1000 working adults assessed effects of perception of fairness, coworkers\u2019 support for breastfeeding colleagues, and ick response on willingness to help mothers needing breaks to pump breastmilk at work. The study also examined how coworker support affected mothers\u2019 self-efficacy to continue breastfeeding. One out of four coworkers showed moderate to strong stigma, saw breaks to pump breastmilk as unfair, and showed less intention to help new mothers. These results suggest that while the majority of coworkers are generally supportive, lactating women are likely to encounter disapproving coworkers who may discourage them from continuing to breastfeed. The data showed that the majority of organizations included in this study have only passively fostered mother-friendly workplaces and could do more to encourage employees to be supportive of lactating ...",

Participants read one of four messages\u2014a weight stigma, a health stigma, a competence, or a stigma-reducing message. Fat phobia, weight controllability, partisanship, political activism, and voting behaviors were also measured. Weight controllability bias interacted with the weight stigma message to produce lower evaluations of political leadership competence. Weight controllability also correlated with higher levels of fat phobia regardless of message exposure. The evidence suggests making stigmatizing comments in print/online against a candidate based on a physical characteristic like large size negatively biases public perceptions of political leadership competence. This study of negative competence evaluation directed toward a real politician confirms the findings of earlier experimental studies with fictitious fat politicians.",

        "abstract": "Smoking remains a serious health threat to many mid- to old-age Chinese people. Many smoking interventions have been implemented in public areas, but smoking occurring in a private setting, such as at home, has largely been neglected. Generativity is based on evaluating the worth of one's life experience that can be passed on to others. This study evaluated whether generativity awareness can have an impact on smoking reduction. Five hundred and eight Chinese smokers were recruited and demonstrated their strong awareness of generativity, specifically general generativity (e.g., moral ethics), health-related generativity (e.g., living a healthy life), and smoke-free family generativity. The study showed support for a three-dimensional model for generativity, namely general, health, and smoke-free generativity. The three types of generativity varied in their effects on behavioral intention to reduce smoking and to encourage younger family members not to smoke. Family communication patterns also influenced behavioral intention to reduce smoking and to encourage younger family members not to smoke. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

Since Christie became newsworthy several years ago, political journalists, other political candidates, cartoonists, comedians, and social commentators often have satirized his weight. In order to investigate the extent of political weight stigma, a content analysis was conducted of 319 online news stories about Chris Christie between 2011 and 2014 identifying 1,490 fat references from political commentators and the public. Over 80% of the 1,490 comments were stigmatizing references to his weight. The most common expression of stigma was negative attribution about Christie\u2019s character associated with large size followed by unflattering metaphors to describe Christie. In every case where political commentators made stigmatizing weight comments, numerous stigmatizing weight comments were posted by the public.

A thematic analysis of American students\u2019 impression about CISs suggested: 1) some Americans stigmatized CISs due to their poor English and reticence in classroom; 2) others were more open-minded to approach CISs\u2019 reticence with intercultural communication competence by taking CISs\u2019 perspective.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Introduction  News media use metaphors to describe politics (Landau u0026 Keefer, 2014) and obesity (Barry, Brescoll, Brownell, u0026 Schlesinger, 2009). Weight-based stigma is prevalent in U.S. news media (Heuer, McClure, u0026 Puhl, 2011). Media coverage of politicians\u2019 body size may contain metaphors that stigmatize weight. Metaphors reflect and shape how people think about important issues like politics or obesity (Landau, Sullivan, u0026 Greenberg, 2009; Landau, Meier, u0026 Keefer, 2010; Landau u0026 Keefer, 2014).    Objective  This study uses stigma communication theory (Smith, 2007) to examine stigmatizing metaphors used in media coverage of a United States politician, and candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Republican.    Method  We coded  n\u00a0 =\u00a0240 articles, from January 2011 to December 2014, that referenced Christieu0027s weight. Considering both the articles and the comments in response to them, we identified  n\u00a0 =\u00a0246 weight references that utilized metaphors and coded these using categories derived from the stigma communication theory framework.    Results  Our coding of these weight references, from journalists and comments posted by the public, demonstrated that metaphors accomplish all four functions of stigma communication: they  mark ,  label ,  assign personal responsibility , and  link to peril  the stigmatized person.    Conclusion  Our findings demonstrate not only that news media use metaphors to describe a politicianu0027s weight, but also show how these metaphors \u2014\u00a0alone and together\u00a0\u2014 function to constitute stigma communication messages. These messages can affect public opinions toward politics and obesity.",

        "abstract": "Small molecule therapeutics can be potent tools for cancer immunotherapy. They may be devised to target the tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Treg), which are major immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment. The infiltration and functionalization of these cells, which essentially promote tumor development, are mediated by the hyper-activation of the Jak-STAT3 signaling pathway. Here, we demonstrated that compound 9#, a novel inhibitor of Jak2, could suppress Jak2-STAT3 signaling in macrophages (peritoneal macrophages and THP-1 cells) and direct the macrophages toward the pro-inflammatory (M1-like) phenotype. When tested in ex vivo TAM culture and in vivo tumor models, compound 9# could reverse the phenotype of TAM from M2- to M1-type by promoting IL-12 expression. Further study suggested that compound 9# also inhibited the induction of Treg both in vitro and in vivo via blockage of Jak2 signaling. Finally, compound 9# potently increased the frequency and anti-tumor activity of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes, leading to effective suppression of tumor growth. Taken together, our findings indicated that compound 9# could be a potential candidate of small molecule therapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "New methods for preparation of tailor-made fluorine-containing compounds are in extremely high demand in nearly every sector of chemical industry. The asymmetric construction of quaternary C-F stereogenic centers is the most synthetically challenging and, consequently, the least developed area of research. As a reflection of this apparent methodological deficit, pharmaceutical drugs featuring C-F stereogenic centers constitute less than 1% of all fluorine-containing medicines currently on the market or in clinical development. Here we provide a comprehensive review of current research activity in this area, including such general directions as asymmetric electrophilic fluorination via organocatalytic and transition-metal catalyzed reactions, asymmetric elaboration of fluorine-containing substrates via alkylations, Mannich, Michael, and aldol additions, cross-coupling reactions, and biocatalytic approaches.",

Here we report the discovery of a general procedure for Pd/Ding-SKP-type ligands-catalyzed SN2 reaction between Colby pro-enolates with MBH carbonates affording the corresponding products featuring two consecutive stereogenic carbons, including C-F quaternary stereogenic center. The reactions readily occur at ambient temperatures with high chemical yields and in excellent chemo-, diastereo- and enantioselective manner. This practically attractive stereochemical outcome, coupled with the operational simplicity and structural generality, bodes well for synthetic application of this process for preparation of novel class biologically relevant fluorine-containing compounds.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. The asymmetric vinylogous Mannich reaction (AVMR) of alfa,alfa-dicyanoalkenes with alfa-fluoroalkyl sulfinyl imines has been successfully accomplished. This transformation is unprecedented with fluorinated imines at the same time as the use of dicyanoalkenes in AVMR has been scarcely reported. Several fluorinated sulfinyl imines are compatible with the process, which gaves access to a family of chiral fluorinated amines with excellent level of stereocontrol. Interestingly, the selectivity found in our protocol is reverse to that encountered in analogous AVMR previously reported. Additionally, the synthetic applicability of the addition products has been exemplified with several transformations showing the particular reactivity of the dicyanoalkene moiety of these alfa-fluorinated amines.",

        "title": "Severe biallelic loss-of-function mutations in nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) in two fetuses with fetal akinesia deformation sequence.",
        "abstract": "The three nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) family members synthesize the electron carrier nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and are essential for cellular metabolism. In mammalian axons, NMNAT activity appears to be required for axon survival and is predominantly provided by NMNAT2. NMNAT2 has recently been shown to also function as a chaperone to aid in the refolding of misfolded proteins. Nmnat2 deficiency in mice, or in its ortholog dNmnat in Drosophila, results in axon outgrowth and survival defects. Peripheral nerve axons in NMNAT2-deficient mice fail to extend and innervate targets, and skeletal muscle is severely underdeveloped. In addition, removing NMNAT2 from established axons initiates axon death by Wallerian degeneration. We report here on two stillborn siblings with fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS), severely reduced skeletal muscle mass and hydrops fetalis. Clinical exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous NMNAT2 variant alleles in both cases. Both protein variants are incapable of supporting axon survival in mouse primary neuron cultures when overexpressed. In vitro assays demonstrate altered protein stability and/or defects in NAD synthesis and chaperone functions. Thus, both patient NMNAT2 alleles are null or severely hypo-morphic. These data indicate a previously unknown role for NMNAT2 in human neurological development and provide the first direct molecular evidence to support the involvement of Wallerian degeneration in a human axonal disorder. SIGNIFICANCE: Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) both synthesizes the electron carrier Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) and acts a protein chaperone. NMNAT2 has emerged as a major neuron survival factor. Overexpression of NMNAT2 protects neurons from Wallerian degeneration after injury and declining levels of NMNAT2 have been implicated in neurodegeneration. While the role of NMANT2 in neurodegeneration has been extensively studied, the role of NMNAT2 in human development remains unclear. In this work, we present the first human variants in NMNAT2 identified in two fetuses with severe skeletal muscle hypoplasia and fetal akinesia. Functional studies in vitro showed that the mutations impair both NMNAT2 NAD synthase and chaperone functions. This work identifies the critical role of NMNAT2 in human development.",

        "title": "Alternative splicing of Drosophila Nmnat functions as a switch to enhance neuroprotection under stress",
        "abstract": "Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) is a conserved enzyme in the NAD synthetic pathway. It has also been identified as an effective and versatile neuroprotective factor. However, it remains unclear how healthy neurons regulate the dual functions of NMNAT and achieve self-protection under stress. Here we show that Drosophila Nmnat (DmNmnat) is alternatively spliced into two mRNA variants, RA and RB, which translate to protein isoforms with divergent neuroprotective capacities against spinocerebellar ataxia 1-induced neurodegeneration. Isoform PA/PC translated from RA is nuclear-localized with minimal neuroprotective ability, and isoform PB/PD translated from RB is cytoplasmic and has robust neuroprotective capacity. Under stress, RB is preferably spliced in neurons to produce the neuroprotective PB/PD isoforms. Our results indicate that alternative splicing functions as a switch that regulates the expression of functionally distinct DmNmnat variants. Neurons respond to stress by driving the splicing switch to produce the neuroprotective variant and therefore achieve self-protection. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) is a highly conserved housekeeping enzyme catalysing reversibly the last step in the NAD salvage pathway in all living organisms1. In addition, NMNAT proteins are essential for neuronal maintenance and protection2. Functional studies in Drosophila and mammals have shown that loss of NMNAT causes neurodegeneration. For example, loss of DmNmnat in photoreceptors causes retinal degeneration2; loss-of-function mutations in human Nmnat1 cause Leber congenital amaurosis 9 (LCA9)3, 4, 5, 6, a childhood blindness disease that involves degeneration of the photoreceptors3, 5, 7; and loss of mouse Nmnat2 causes axonal degeneration8. The neuronal maintenance function of NMNAT can be enhanced by overexpression to achieve neuroprotection against a variety of neurodegenerative conditions9. For example, overexpression of yeast NMNAT (NMA1) protects against polyglutamine (polyQ)-induced cytotoxicity10, expression of Drosophila NMNAT protects against light-induced retinal degeneration2 or Wallerian degeneration in cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons11 and ectopic expression of any of the three human NMNAT confers neuroprotection against axonal degeneration in cultured neurons or transgenic mouse models (see reviews9, 12). These observations suggest that the neuroprotective property of NMNAT is conserved through distant phyla. In most of the mammalian degenerative models, particularly in axonal degeneration, it has been suggested that the NAD synthetic activity of NMNAT is required for its neuroprotective activity (see reviews12, 13). In addition to its enzymatic function, work from our group14 and others10, 15 has identified a chaperone function of DmNMNAT that contributes to neuroprotection by directly interacting with unfolded/misfolded proteins in the nervous system, reducing the load of toxic protein oligomers and facilitating the clearance of unfolded proteins14, 16, 17. These studies in different model systems have provided evidence supporting two roles of NMNAT in neurons: chaperone and NAD metabolism. It remains unclear whether, and if so how, neurons regulate the partitioning of NMNAT into these two roles and balance metabolic and self-protective activities. Alternative splicing is an important post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism for cells to generate transcript variability and proteome diversity18, 19. It is estimated that 95% of multiexonic genes in humans and 65% in Drosophila are alternatively spliced20, 21. In the nervous system, this process is especially common for gene regulation. Recent work has identified several aspects of neural development and function that are specifically controlled by alternative splicing. Examples include fibroblast growth factor 8 in neural tube patterning22, the Drosophila homologue of Down\u2019s syndrome cell-adhesion molecule in the axon guidance and dendrite morphogenesis23, 24, 25, as well as neurexins and neuroligins in synaptogenesis26, 27. In the mature nervous system, it has been shown that Nova-1 regulates neuronal-specific alternative splicing and is essential to maintain neuronal health28, and neuronal activity dynamically regulates the splicing of products that determine neuronal excitation such as SNARE protein SNAP25 (ref. 29). Misregulation of alternative splicing or of splicing regulatory factors can lead to multiple human neurodegenerative diseases30, such as spinal muscular atrophy31, frontotemporal lobar dementias and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis32, and tauopathies33. These studies highlight the important role of alternative splicing in nervous system development and function. However, the role of alternative splicing in neuronal maintenance and protection has not been as widely studied. Here we seek to address the mechanisms of how neurons regulate the expression of DmNmnat to enhance its neuroprotective capability. We have characterized the neuroprotective functions and biochemical and cellular properties of DmNMNAT isoforms, and directly monitored the shift in alternative splicing in vivo in the Drosophila nervous system using an alternative-splicing reporter. Our results identify alternative splicing of DmNmnat as a switch for regulating neuroprotection, and reveal a neuronal mechanism of achieving NMNAT-mediated self-protection under stress. Drosophila melanogaster has one Nmnat gene that contains seven tandem exons (Fig. 1a). Gene structure analyses suggest that DmNmnat is alternatively spliced into two mRNA variants RA and RB, with the first four exons constitutively included and the last three exons differentially spliced (Fig. 1a). A previous report analysing splice sites in the Drosophila genome identified sequences in the fourth intron and fifth exon that can form a \u2018stem\u2013loop\u2019 structure to facilitate the alternative splicing event (Boxes 1 and 2 in Fig.1a)34. In addition, the first exon contains two putative translational start codons, which may further increase the protein diversity. To determine the endogenous DmNmnat variants, we first used variant-specific amplification primers located in exon 5 (E5R) and 7 (E7R) to identify the mRNA transcripts. Two mRNA transcripts from adult fly brain extracts were identified (Fig. 1b) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing to correspond to RA and RB mRNA variants, as annotated in FlyBase (www.flybase.org). Two protein products are predicted to translate from two alternative start codons for each mRNA variant: PA/PC from RA and PB/PD from RB (Fig. 1a). To identify the protein isoforms, we performed western blot analysis using a DmNMNAT polyclonal antibody2. Since the antibody was raised against the PD isoform2, we first tested whether this antibody can recognize all four potential protein isoforms. First, we generated and expressed DsRed-tagged DmNMNAT isoforms in HEK293T cells and found that both DmNMNAT and DsRed antibodies recognized all four isoforms (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Next, we generated transgenic fly strains carrying the cDNA of a predicted protein isoform: PA, PB, PC or PD. When the individual transgenes were ubiquitously expressed (actin-GAL4) in wild-type (Nmnat+/+) or null (Nmnat\u2212/\u2212) background, four protein isoforms PA, PB, PC and PD were detected at their respective predicted molecular weights: PA (43.8\u2009kD) and PB (33.5\u2009kD) translated from the first start codon, and PC (40.1\u2009kD) and PD (29.8\u2009kD) translated from the second start codon (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The polyclonal NMNAT antibody detected the endogenous NMNAT isoforms and found the expression to increase on heat shock, especially the PB and PD isoforms (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b), consistent with a previous study35. Notably, when the transgenes carrying PA or PB cDNA were expressed, PC or PD proteins were also detected at a relatively higher level (Supplementary Fig. 1b), suggesting that the translation from the second translational start codon is more efficient. Sequence analysis of the N-terminal region revealed that the second start site contains a frontal Drosophila Kozak consensus sequence (GAAA)36, consistent with more efficient translation. To further confirm the functionality of each isoform, we carried out rescue analysis by expressing each isoform ubiquitously in the null background2. Expression of individual isoforms suppressed the lethality caused by loss of DmNmnat, indicating that all isoforms are functional when expressed alone (Supplementary Table 1). The difference in rescue efficiency was likely owing to differences in transgene expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Because PC and PD are the dominant isoforms in vivo, for the following analyses we focused on the PC and PD isoforms as the model protein products from alternatively spliced mRNA variants, RA and RB, respectively. Our previous study found endogenous DmNMNAT to be ubiquitously distributed in the cytoplasm and synaptic terminals with enrichment in the nucleus2. As these localization observations were made using the polyclonal antibody that recognizes all isoforms (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b), it is possible that such a broad localization pattern is actually the summation of distinct subcellular distributions of each isoform. To address the localization patterns in vivo, we ubiquitously expressed PC or PD isoform in Nmnat\u2212/\u2212 background to avoid the influence of endogenous DmNMNAT. PC- or PD-singly expressed adult brains showed a nonoverlapping pattern, where PC is highly enriched in the cell body and PD is predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, the endogenous DmNMNAT expression pattern is a combined distribution patterns of all isoforms. These data suggest that alternative splicing of DmNmnat produces two protein products that localize to distinct subcellular compartments: nuclear PC and cytosolic PD. To further investigate the mechanism of DmNMNAT localization, we analysed the C-terminal amino-acid sequence of PC and PD and identified a putative nuclear localization signal, a KKQK motif37, 38 encoded in exon 7 (Fig. 2a). We subsequently generated a mutant PC isoform with the first lysine in the motif mutated to arginine (PCK349R) and expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged DmNMNAT isoforms in Cos-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2b, PC was nuclear-localized, while PCK349R was localized to the cytoplasm, suggesting that the KKQK motif is the nuclear localization signal. We named the PCK349R mutant isoform cytPC and generated a transgenic fly strain carrying UAS-cytPC for in vivo analysis. Next, we examined the localization of PC, cytPC and PD isoforms in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2c, when expressed with a pan-neuronal driver nervana-GAL4, PC is highly enriched in the cell body, while cytPC and PD are predominantly cytoplasmic, consistent with the localization pattern in transfected cells. Collectively, these data indicate that DmNMNAT isoforms are localized to distinct cellular compartments because of the differentially spliced C-terminal sequences that result in either the inclusion (PC) or exclusion (PD) of the KKQK nuclear localization motif. Work from our group and others has shown the robust neuroprotective activity of DmNMNAT, specifically of the PD isoform14, 15, 16, 39, 40. Detecting the endogenous expression of DmNMNAT isoforms compelled us to ask whether all isoforms share similar neuroprotective activity. We tested the neuroprotective efficacy of each isoform against neurodegeneration induced by the expression of human Ataxin-1 with 82 polyQ expansion (hAtx-1[82Q])14. Consistent with a previous report14, hAtx-1[82Q] expression in the nervous system induced an age-dependent decline in climbing performance, which was partially suppressed by PD expression (82Q+PD). Unexpectedly, PC expression (82Q+PC) not only failed to suppress the behavioural decline, but rather aggravated it (Fig. 3a,b). Interestingly, flies expressing cytPC (82Q+cytPC) showed climbing behaviour similar to the control GFP-expressing flies (82Q+GFP). To examine the cellular changes during neurodegeneration, we analysed the brain morphology of flies 2 DAE (days after eclosion). This age was chosen because it preceded the onset of behavioural defects (Fig. 3b) and therefore would allow the identification of early events and causal cellular processes of degeneration. Interestingly, the distribution of hAtx-1[82Q] protein differed greatly among the four genotypes tested. Human ataxin-1[82Q] is nuclear-localized and is known to cause nuclear aggregation41. As shown in Fig. 3c, in GFP control brains we observed hAtx-1[82Q] in the nuclei surrounded by endogenous NMNAT. In PC-expressing brains, nuclear hAtx-1[82Q] aggregates became larger and co-localized with NMNAT. In cytPC-expressing brains, hAtx-1[82Q] showed enrichment in the nuclei similar to GFP control brains. In contrast, in PD-expressing brains, hAtx-1[82Q] was diffused throughout the neuronal cytoplasm with minimal aggregation in the nucleus. To determine whether expression of DmNMNAT isoforms affects neuronal cell death by hAtx-1[82Q] expression, we measured the activation of caspase-3 as a hallmark of apoptosis42. As shown in Fig. 3d, the level of activated cleaved caspase-3 signal is highest in PC-expressing brains and lowest in PD-expressing brains. To quantitatively monitor the activation of apoptosis, we next examined the biochemical processing of caspase-3. The activation of procaspase-3 involves multiple cleavage steps, resulting in different processed products, and the fully processed product P12 is the activated caspase-3 (ref. 43). As shown in Fig. 3e,f, hAtx-1[82Q] expression induced a significant elevation of P12 levels in brains, indicating hAtx-1[82Q]-induced apoptosis. Specifically, PD expression greatly reduced the activation of caspase-3 to a similar level in the wild-type brains of the same age. However, neither PC nor cytPC expression reduced cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 3e,f). Collectively, these results suggest that PD has robust neuroprotective activity, while PC has minimal neuroprotective activity and may even exacerbate hAtx-1[82Q]-induced degeneration as shown by the significant behavioural decline at 20 DAE. Furthermore, a lack of protection by cytPC indicates that the difference in protection between PC and PD is inherent to protein properties beyond subcellular localization. It has been shown that the size of polyQ aggregates is positively correlated with disease severity and onset41, 44. Previous studies have shown that transgenic hAtx-1[82Q] forms aggregates in cultured cells, transgenic mouse and fly brains and the observed hAtx-1[82Q] puncta clusters correlate with polyQ aggregates14, 45, 46. To further quantitatively evaluate the divergent effects of DmNMNAT isoforms in nuclear polyQ aggregation, we expressed GFP-tagged human ataxin-1 without polyQ expansion (hAtx-1[2Q]), or with subpathological (hAtx-1[30Q]) or pathological (hAtx-1[82Q]) lengths of polyQ expansion with DsRed-tagged DmNMNAT isoforms in cultured Cos-7 cells. We found that all hAtx-1 proteins formed aggregates (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 3a), consistent with a previous report14. The size of the visible aggregates (arrow), as well as the percentage of cells that contain aggregates, increased with the expansion of the polyQ47. Interestingly, co-expression of PC or PD had opposite effects on polyQ aggregation\u2014PC promoted the size and the formation of aggregates in cells, while PD reduced both parameters (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Notably, PC formed a \u2018ring-like\u2019 pattern surrounding the nuclear hAtx-1[82Q] aggregates (arrow heads, Fig. 4a4). PD not only reduced the size of nuclear polyQ aggregates but also promoted the partial relocation of hAtx-1 into the cytoplasm, which can be detected when the low intensity range (0\u20131,000) was amplified (Fig. 4a3). This suggests that PD can promote the clearance of nuclear misfolded hAtx-1 in cultured cells and may explain the similar cytoplasmic redistribution we observed in fly brains (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, cytPC had the same effect on aggregation as the control DsRed, suggesting that PC does not facilitate the clearance of misfolded hAtx-1 protein even when it is present in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that PC and PD have different effects on nuclear polyQ aggregation: PC aggravates the nuclear aggregation of hAtx-1 with polyQ expansion, while PD can reduce the ectopically expressed toxic protein load. Collectively, these experiments on polyQ aggregation in Drosophila and cell culture models show that DmNMNAT isoforms generated from alternatively spliced mRNA variants have divergent neuroprotective properties. PD from RB variant has a robust neuroprotective ability, reduces hAtx-1[82Q] protein aggregation load and attenuates neuronal death, while PC from RA variant aggravates the nuclear aggregation of hAtx-1, increases neuronal apoptosis and exacerbates degeneration. To dissect the mechanism underlying the divergent neuroprotective effects of DmNMNAT isoforms, we next characterized the biochemical properties of PC and PD. Previous studies have shown that DmNMNAT has NAD synthesis and chaperone activity2, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17. We performed in vitro and in culture assays to determine these biochemical properties14. First, we isolated recombinant proteins of the HsNMNAT3, DmNMNAT-PC, -cytPC and -PD (Fig. 5b), and determined their NAD synthetic activity in vitro by a continuous coupled enzyme assay48 (Fig. 5a). We found that all NMNAT isoforms can synthesize NAD to a similar extent (Fig. 5c). Next, we determined the chaperone function of PC and PD, both the \u2018holdase\u201949 and \u2018foldase\u201950 aspects of chaperone activity. First, we used an in vitro aggregation assay to directly measure the ability of recombinant PC and PD proteins to interact and prevent unfolded protein aggregation (Fig. 5g)14. As shown in Fig. 5d\u2013f, both PC and PD prevented citrate synthase (CS) aggregation, with PC showing the lowest aggregation rate at all tested chaperone concentrations, suggesting that PC has holdase activity equal to or greater than that of PD. Second, we used the in-cell luciferase-refolding assay to measure the ability of DmNMNAT isoforms to facilitate the refolding of unfolded luciferase after heat shock14 (Fig. 5h,i and Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). This assay allows the measurement of both luciferase unfolding during heat shock (red bars) and refolding after recovery (green bars). To minimize cell-type-specific effects, we performed the luciferase-refolding assay in mammalian HEK293T cells (Fig. 5) and Drosophila S2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4) and obtained similar results. As shown in Fig. 5i and Supplementary Fig. 4b, PD expression protected luciferase from unfolding during heat shock and enhanced refolding significantly after heat shock, similar to that of positive controls mammalian heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and Drosophila Hsp83, the homologue of mammalian Hsp90 (ref. 51). Interestingly, PC greatly protected luciferase from unfolding during heat shock, but showed no significant refolding activity during recovery after heat shock compared with the other two groups. This difference was not caused by the localization of luciferase for two reasons: (1) luciferase was present in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, unaffected by the expression of Hsp83, PC or PD (Supplementary Fig. 4c), and therefore was accessible to both cytoplasmic PD (and Hsp70/Hsp83) and nuclear PC; (2) cytPC expression exhibited the same luciferase\u2013holdase/foldase ability as PC, demonstrating a localization-independent property of PC. The biochemical characterizations of the DmNMNAT isoforms suggest that both spliced mRNA variants produce functional NAD synthases and chaperones. The protein isoforms share some aspects of biochemical properties but have distinct cellular characteristics. Specifically, RA produces nuclear protein PC with strong holdase activity, but with minimal refolding activity; RB produces cytoplasmic protein PD with strong refolding activity. Importantly, these specific cellular features of PC, that is, strong holdase but minimal refolding activity and nuclear localization, are consistent with its ability to enhance hAtx-1[82Q] aggregation when co-expressed. In contrast, PD showed refolding activity and is therefore capable of facilitating cellular clearance of unfolded proteins to reduce proteotoxicity. The divergent neuroprotective outcome from overexpression of alternatively spliced isoforms posed the question of how the nervous system regulates the alternative splicing of DmNmnat endogenously. Previous work has found DmNmnat as a stress\u2013response factor with its transcription regulated by heat shock factor (HSF)35. Both RA and RB originate from a common promoter region and share the first four exons; hence, their 5\u2032 transcriptional regulatory elements are the same. However, we found that RA and RB are not equally expressed under normal conditions but at a ratio of 1.46:1 (RA/RB; Supplementary Fig. 5d), suggesting preferred expression of RA under normal conditions. To examine how stress regulates the expression of DmNmnat variants, we determined the mRNA level of each variant under two stress conditions: heat shock stress (acute stress) and two proteotoxic stress (chronic stress) conditions induced by neuronal overexpression of either hAtx-1[82Q]14 or human Tau16. Interestingly, under all stress conditions tested, RA and RB showed distinct expression profiles. Under heat stress, RB was greatly increased immediately (within 15\u2009min) on heat shock following a rise-and-fall pattern similar to that of Hsp70, while RA levels remained stable (Fig. 6a). Under proteotoxic stress, when either hAtx-1[82Q] or hTau was expressed in the nervous system, DmNmnat transcript expression, especially RB, was greatly increased compared with wild-type (yw) control (Fig. 6b,c). The rise in expression was similar to Hsp26 and Hsp70, suggesting that DmNmnat upregulation is a part of the endogenous stress response to proteotoxicity, consistent with previous observations14, 35. Notably, in the late stage (20 DAE) of both proteotoxic stress models, both RB and heat shock protein (Hsp26 and Hsp70) transcripts were decreased (Fig. 6b,c). This is likely because of the sequestration of transcription factors by accumulated polyQ or Tau, similar to a previous report that found Hsp70 transcriptional upregulation in early stages of polyQ disease models and decline in expression in late stages52. These results suggest that the expression of RA and RB are differentially regulated under normal and stress conditions. While RA is favourably expressed under normal conditions, RB is induced immediately on stress and its expression greatly surpasses that of RA. The rise-and-fall expression pattern of RB is similar to that of stress proteins such as Hsp70 and Hsp26. Such a differential expression of DmNmnat variants under stress can be achieved by regulating either 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR)-mediated mRNA stability or alternative splicing, or a combination of both. To dissect the precise steps in RNA processing that are regulated by stress, we first determined the mRNA stability by measuring the decay rate of each variant under normal or stress conditions, using an actinomycin D (Act.D) chase assay53. As shown in Fig. 6d, the decay rate of RB under normal conditions (t1/2=2.97\u2009h) was much faster than that of RA (t1/2=16.1\u2009h). Under stress the degradation of RB increased significantly (t1/2=2.04\u2009h), while RA remained stable (t1/2=16.1\u2009h). These observations suggest that RA is more stable than RB, and stress further increases the decay rate of RB. Therefore, the differential expression of DmNmnat variants and the increased RB levels under stress conditions are unlikely because of a difference in RNA stability. Since the 3\u2032UTR sequences of RA and RB are quite distinct, we further determined the role of 3\u2032UTRs in regulating the stability of DmNmnat variants under normal and stress conditions using a luciferase reporter assay in which the 3\u2032UTRs of RA and RB were inserted into the 3\u2032 end of the luciferase-coding sequence. The RA 3\u2032UTR had minimal effect on the expression of luciferase mRNA under heat shock stress; however, the 3\u2032UTR of RB resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in the luciferase mRNA expression level under stress, similar to that of the 3\u2032UTR of hsp70, which has been reported to be unstable under heat shock54 (Fig. 6e). This effect is also reflected from the amount of functional luciferase protein translated from the mRNA, as the level of luciferase luminescence was significantly reduced under stress when the 3\u2032UTR of RB was linked to luciferase (Fig. 6f). These results indicate that the 3\u2032UTR is an important regulator of DmNmnat variants, and that stress decreases the mRNA stability of RB. However, differences in mRNA stability do not explain the observed levels of DmNmnat variants, specifically the increase in RB expression under stress conditions, despite the stress-induced instability because of its 3\u2032UTR. The only possible step for the differential regulation of DmNmnat variants, then, is alternative splicing. To visualize and quantitatively analyse splicing events in the nervous system in vivo, we generated a reporter construct in pUAST vector spanning the alternatively spliced exons 4\u20137 of the DmNmnat genomic sequence (UAS-DmNMNAT4\u20137AltReport; Fig. 7a). This alternative splicing reporter also contains an AcGFP sequence inserted into exon 6 to serve as a proxy for splicing to RA, and a DsRed sequence inserted into exon 5 to indicate the splicing event that generates RB. After functionally confirming this reporter in cultured cells (Supplementary Fig. 6), we generated transgenic fly lines carrying UAS-DmNMNAT4\u20137AltReport and further confirmed its functionality in vivo. We designed primers bridging spliced exons (Fig. 7a) to amplify mRNAs produced through alternative splicing of the reporter using reverse transcriptase\u2013PCR (RT\u2013PCR). As shown in Fig. 7b, two transcripts were detected from brain extracts of flies expressing neuronal DmNMNAT4\u20137AltReport by elavC155-GAL4. These two fragments correspond to the predicted mRNA transcripts generated by unique splicing events. Therefore, DmNMNAT4\u20137AltReport is a functional tool for visualizing alternative splicing events in vivo in a tissue- and cell-specific manner and for determining quantitatively the ratio of RA versus RB being spliced. To examine how stress affects splicing of DmNmnat, we first expressed the reporter in neurons by elav-GAL4, in glia by repo-GAL4 or in all cells by actin-GAL4, and subjected the progeny reporter flies to heat shock stress (Fig. 7c). Because AcGFP and DsRed have similar protein stabilities with half-lives longer than the time of study (Clontech), the level of each reporter protein reflects the mRNA levels of RA and RB. Furthermore, any change of elav, repo and actin promoter activity in response to stress will affect both AcGFP and DsRed equally and will not confound the interpretation of splicing events detected by this reporter. Therefore, any change in the observed levels of AcGFP and DsRed can be attributed to a change in splicing. We first quantitatively determined the expression levels of AcGFP and DsRed under normal conditions (RT) and at 3 and 6\u2009h post-heat shock (Fig. 7c\u2013e). Interestingly, when the reporter was expressed in neurons, heat stress led to increased levels of DsRed (reporter for splicing to RB) by 100% without affecting the level of AcGFP (reporter for splicing to RA), suggesting that the splicing is shifted towards RB under stress. In glia, however, heat stress increased the level of AcGFP (RA) by 35% and concomitantly decreased the level of DsRed (RB) by 27%. When the reporter was expressed ubiquitously, we observed an overall slight increase in AcGFP (RA) and DsRed (RB) expression by 19% and 44%, respectively, in the whole brain (Fig. 7d,e). Next, we directly visualized the splicing reporters in the brain under normal and stress conditions. Consistent with the biochemical analysis, we observed a significant increase in DsRed (RB) signal in neurons, a reduction in glial cells, and a combined slight increase in the whole-brain post-heat shock (Fig. 7f). Collectively, these data showed that first alternative splicing is the major step in RNA processing that results in the differential regulation of DmNmnat under stress in the brain; second, the effect of stress on DmNmnat pre-mRNA splicing differs in neurons and glia: under stress, neurons strongly prefer to splice to RB, while glia cells have a modest preference for RA. The latter also suggests that the remarkable upregulation of endogenous RB observed in the brain under stress (Fig. 6a\u2013c) is contributed primarily by the neuronal population. This finding implies that the composition of DmNMNAT isoforms is under cell-type-specific regulation and that PD isoform has distinct functional role in neurons, specifically under stress. In this study, we identified a critical role of alternative splicing in regulating the maintenance capacity of the nervous system. Our results demonstrated that, through alternative splicing, two sets of protein products are generated from the DmNmnat gene. PC translated from RA is nuclear-localized, has strong \u2018holdase\u2019 activity, minimum refolding activity and no neuroprotective activity against hAtx-1[82Q]-induced neurodegeneration. In contrast, PD translated from RB is localized to the cytoplasm, has strong refolding activity and robust protective activity against hAtx-1[82Q]-induced neurodegeneration. Since RA and RB are mutually exclusive, alternative splicing functions as a switch in DmNmnat expression between RA and RB: RA to produce nuclear protein isoforms, and RB to produce cytoplasmic neuroprotective factors (Fig. 8). Importantly, this switch is regulated by stress in the nervous system. Under normal conditions, both RA and RB are transcribed, with slightly more RA (RA:RB=1.46:1); therefore, both PC and PD proteins are expressed to sustain basic physiological needs. When neurons are under stress from either external (heat or hypoxia) or internal (proteotoxic) origin, the transcription of the DmNmnat gene is upregulated35 and the splicing of pre-mRNA is shifted to RB, therefore allowing the production of PD with robust neuroprotective activity (Fig. 8). Such regulation at the level of pre-mRNA splicing allows neurons to quickly respond to stress and achieve self-protection. Stress response is a key process for all cells to maintain homeostasis. Central to the stress response is the increased synthesis of molecular chaperone (HSPs) that function to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation to maintain protein homeostasis55, 56. On the onset of stress, the transcription of HSPs is quickly initiated by stress transcription factors such as HSFs or hypoxia-inducible factors57. The mRNA transcripts of inducible HSPs are often labile to facilitate rapid downregulation of the expression of HSP proteins after stress. Indeed, the half-life of Hsp70 or Hsp26 mRNA is less than 1\u2009h (refs 58, 59), much shorter than those of some of the housekeeping genes; for instance, over 8\u2009h for rp49 mRNA60. Previously, we have shown that DmNmnat is a stress\u2013response factor and its transcription is upregulated under stress by the stress transcription factor HSF, similar to HSPs35. Interestingly, here we found that only RB is increased under stress, and DmNmnat variants have very different half-lives: RA has a long half-life of 16.1\u2009h, and RB has short half-life of 2.97\u2009h, which is further reduced to 2.04\u2009h under stress (Fig. 6). Therefore, the transcription and regulation patterns of RA and RB fit the profiles of housekeeping genes and stress\u2013response factors, respectively. Collectively, our findings present a model in which DmNmnat assumes two identities through alternative splicing: a housekeeping variant that is constitutively expressed with a long half-life and a stress\u2013response variant that exhibits increased expression of unstable transcripts under stress. This mode of post-transcriptional regulation increases cellular tolerance to stress without adding new genes. Mammals have three Nmnat genes, Nmnat1, -2 and -3, with distinct tissue expression and subcellular localizations61. It is possible that mammals achieve functional diversity of NMNAT through gene duplication rather than alternative splicing. For example, Human NMNAT1 and -2 are highly expressed in the nervous system, and NMNAT1 protein is nuclear-localized while NMNAT2 is cytoplasmic61. Both NMNAT1 and -2 have NAD synthetic activity and have been shown to be neuroprotective when expressed in the cytoplasm (see reviews9, 12, 13). Nuclear-localized NMNAT1 plays a role in preventing cell death after DNA damage, as its NAD synthetic activity is essential for the function of DNA repair enzymes such as PARP-1 (ref. 62). It is likely that the PC isoform is required in the nucleus for NAD metabolism, a hypothesis that requires experimental confirmation. It is worth noting that the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by alternative splicing may be conserved between Drosophila and mammalian Nmnat homologues, as all three human NMNAT genes are multiexonic and predicted to be alternatively spliced. In a recent study, two splice variants of human NMNAT3 (v1 and V3-FKSG76) have been experimentally identified63. It will be intriguing to investigate the alternative splicing and transcriptional regulation of human NMNAT1 and -2 in the nervous system. Exploring the role of alternative splicing in regulating neuronal maintenance and protection will prove both interesting and promising for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies for neuroprotection. The regulation of alternative splicing occurs in multiple ways, including developmental stage-specific, sex-specific or tissue-specific manners and even in response to environmental64 or cellular (ER) stress65, 66. Our findings also indicate that differential splicing events of DmNmnat could occur in a cell-type-specific manner. It has been reported that cell-specific alternative splicing not only participates in neuronal development24, but is also involved in human diseases such as cancer10 and neurodegeneration7. Recent studies have revealed that cell-specific alternative splicing in vertebrates involves repression in the inappropriate cell type as well as activation in the appropriate cell type30. Future work is required to identify the molecular components in the splicing machinery that sense and respond to stress in a cell-specific manner. Maintaining neuronal homeostasis is a prerequisite for proper neurological activity. Healthy neurons are able to maintain their integrity throughout the life of an animal, suggesting the existence of a maintenance mechanism that allows neurons to sustain, mitigate or even repair internal or external damage. Our identification of alternative splicing functioning as a switch to enhance the neuroprotective role of DmNmnat indicates that the neuronal maintenance capacity is regulated endogenously and enhanced under stress for neurons to confer self-protection and higher resistance to adverse conditions. Fifteen recombinant plasmids were generated for this study. They are pUAST-luciferase-rp49, pUAST-luciferase-hsp70, pUAST-luciferase-RA, pUAST-luciferase-RB, pUAST-DmNMNATPA, pUAST-DmNMNATPB, pUAST-DmNMNATPC, pUAST-DmNMNATcytPC pUAST-DmNMNATPD, pDsRed2-PA, pDsRed2-PB, pDsRed2-PC, pDsRed2-cytPC, pDsRed2-PD and UAS-DmNMNAT4\u20137AltReport. The primer sequences used in detection and cloning are listed in the Supplementary Table 2. Flies were maintained on a cornmeal\u2013molasses\u2013yeast medium and at room temperature (22\u2009\u00b0C) with 60\u201365% humidity. The following Drosophila lines were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center: elav-GAL4, repo-GAL4, actin-GAL4 and nervana-GAL4. The UAS-hAtx-1[2Q], UAS-hAtx-1[30Q] and UAS-hAtx-1[82Q] lines were obtained from Dr Huda Zoghbi\u2019s laboratory14. Adult female flies collected 24\u201348\u2009h post eclosion were subjected to two 1-h heat shock at 37\u2009\u00b0C with a 30-min room temperature period of acclimatization between shocks35. Following shock, the flies were collected at various time points. Both mRNA extraction and protein extraction were performed in preparation for further experiments. Standard PCR was performed using the FailSafe PCR System (EpiCentre, Chichago, IL, USA) with the following amplification conditions: 25 cycles of 50\u2009s at 95\u2009\u00b0C, 50s at 60\u2009\u00b0C and 1\u2009min at 72\u2009\u00b0C. The primers designed (Supplementary Table 2) for variant detection are common forward primer targeted the exon 1, and two distinct reverse primers targeted exon 5 and exon 7, respectively. The samples for RNA extraction were collected from fresh or ultrarapid frozen fly heads or Drosophila S2 cells. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For each extraction, RNA concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 260\u2009nm, and 2\u2009\u03bcg of RNA was used for reverse transcription reaction with a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantification of mRNA levels was performed using a CFX connect real-time detection system (Bio-Rad) and TaqMan probe-based gene expression analysis (Applied Biosystems). The amplification mix (20\u2009\u03bcl) contained 100\u2009ng of ssDNA reverse transcribed from total RNA, and 1\u2009\u03bcl of gene-specific TaqMan probe\u2013primer set. The samples were amplified by a PCR programme of 40 cycles of 10\u2009s at 95\u2009\u00b0C, 15 s at 55\u2009\u00b0C and 1\u2009min at 72\u2009\u00b0C. The quantification of mRNA levels was carried out by the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) Method67. A housekeeping gene, rp49, or Gal4 was used as an internal control to standardize mRNA expression. Drosophila S2 cells were incubated at room temperature for 30\u2009min with 10\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 of the transcriptional inhibitor Act.D (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA). After 30\u2009m incubation with Act.D, Drosophila S2 cells were split equally into two groups. One was subjected to 1-h heat shock at 37\u2009\u00b0C, and the other was retained at room temperature. At the indicated time points after the addition of Act.D, cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted. The expression levels of RA and RB at each time point were measured using qRT\u2013PCR and normalized to the corresponding rp49 levels. The remaining mRNA was determined by comparison with the expression level of the relevant gene at the zero time point when Act.D was added. Data were plotted on semi-log charts and exponential regression lines generated in Microsoft excel. The slope (m) of the regression lines was used to calculate the mRNA half-life (t1/2) using the equation t1/2=ln(2)/m to examine stability53. Drosophila S2 cells were triply transfected in six-well plates using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) with pAC-GAL4, pAC-Renilla luciferase and one of the following pUAST-luciferase reporter containing the indicated fragment from 3\u2032UTR of various genes: pUAST-luciferase-SV40, pUAST-luciferase-rp49, pUAST-luciferase-hsp70, pUAST-luciferase-RA and pUAST-luciferase-RB. At 72\u2009h after transfection, the transcriptional inhibitor Act.D was added and cells were equally split onto two plates and one of the plates was subjected to a 1\u2009h heat shock in an air incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C (which induced mild heat stress without unfolding luciferase). Then, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) by means of luminescence measurements using a BMG plate reader. pET28b plasmids with NMNAT cDNA sequences were transformed into BL21DE3 bacteria and grown overnight. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-b-D-thio-galactoside to the culture medium. The recombinant proteins were purified through His-select Ni-affinity gel (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and Poly-Prep chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). Proteins were extracted from fly heads with a homogenizing buffer (10\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 10\u2009mM KCl, 1\u2009mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5\u2009mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Samples were spun at 14,000g for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Supernatant 1 was collected for later analysis. The pellets were resuspended with a protein extraction buffer (30\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.6\u2009M NaCl, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.4\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM DTT, 25% glycerol, 1% NP-40 and 0.5\u2009mM PMSF) and incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min with vortexing every 6\u2009min. Then the supernatant 2 was collected after 30\u2009min centrifugation at 14,000g at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Next, supernatants 1 and 2 were equally mixed and heated at 95\u2009\u00b0C with 4 \u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer. Lysates were probed with anti-DmNMNAT (1:8,000); Living Colors AcGFP Monoclonal Antibody (JL-8; 1:1,000, Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA); Living Colors DsRed Polyclonal Antibody (1:1,000, Clontech); anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) and anti-\u03b2-Actin antibody (1:10,000, Sigma). Western blot analysis was carried out using the infrared dye-conjugated secondary antibodies, IR700 and IR800 (LI-COR Biosciences), and blots were imaged and processed on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging system. The enzymatic activity of NMNAT was measured in a continuous coupled enzyme assay by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340\u2009nm caused by the reduction of NAD to NADH48. The reaction was performed at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 16\u2009nM semicarbazide-HCl, 0.625% (v/v) ethanol, 30\u2009nM HEPES buffer (pH=7.4), 1.17\u2009mM ATP, 15\u2009U yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma), purified recombinant NMNAT protein variants and was initiated by adding nicotinamide mononucleotidase (NMN) to a final concentration of 0.625\u2009nM. The activity is determined from the linear progression curve using the following formula:  where C0\u03b2-NADH, the extinction coefficient of \u03b2-NADH at 340\u2009nm, is 6.22. In mammalian cells, HEK293T cells were double-transfected in six-well plates using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with pCMV-luficerase, and one of the following plasmids: pDsRed2 vector, pCMV-hsp70, pDsRed2-PC, pDsRed2-cytPC and pDsRed2-PD. At 48\u2009h after transfection, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was added and cells were subjected to a 15\u2009min heat shock in an air incubator at 42\u2009\u00b0C (which induced efficient unfolding of luciferase without killing the cells) and were then allowed to recover at 37\u2009\u00b0C (ref. 68). In Drosophila cells, Drosophila S2 cells were triply transfected with pAC-GAL4, pUAST-luciferase and one of the following plasmids: pUAST vector, pUAST-hsp83, pUAST-DmNMNATPA, pUAST-DmNMNATPB, pUAST-DmNMNATPC and pUAST-DmNMNATPD. At 72\u2009h after transfection, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was added and cells were subjected to a 15-min heat shock in an air incubator at 42\u2009\u00b0C (which induced efficient unfolding of luciferase without killing the cells) and were then allowed to recover at room temperature14. Luciferase activity was measured with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The substrate protein CS (Sigma) was mixed with egg white lysozyme (Sigma), or affinity-purified recombinant DmNMNATPC, DmNMNATPD or HsNMNAT3 proteins in HEPES (pH 7.4) buffer. Aggregation of denatured CS was induced by incubation at 43\u2009\u00b0C. Aggregation was monitored by measuring the apparent absorption at 360\u2009nm, owing to Rayleigh scattering of CS homoaggregates versus time. Measurements were performed on a FluoStar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech). The relative chaperone activity of NMNAT was calculated as the scattering of CS aggregates with time versus NMNAT concentration14. Cos-7 cells were co-transfected with lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). After 48\u2009h transfection, cells were fixed and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue) and visualized with an Olympus IX81 confocal microscope under \u00d7 60 magnification. DAPI Channel was thresholded to 400\u20134,095 and converted to binary signals to determine the size of nuclei. For the measurement of aggregates, the GFP channel was thresholded to 1,100\u20134,095. Aggregates are defined as GFP-positive objects of at least 0.4\u2009\u03bcm2 and 3,000 intensity units. Adult brains were fixed in PBS with 3.5% formaldehyde for 15\u2009min and washed in PBS with 0.4% Triton X-100. Antibody dilutions used were as follows: anti-DmNMNAT (1:500); anti-Ataxin-1 wild-type (1:500, NeuroMab, Davis, CA, USA); anti-Cleaved Caspase 3 (Asp175; 1:250, Cell Signaling); anti-nc82 (1:250, DSHB, East Iowa City, IA, USA) and secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488, Alex 555 or Alex 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Molecular Probes) were used at 1:250. DAPI (1:1,000, Invitrogen) staining was performed post-secondary antibody staining. All antibody incubations were performed at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight in the presence of 5% normal goat serum. Confocal microscopy was performed with an Olympus IX81 confocal microscope and processed using FluoView 10-ASW (Olympus) and Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). Ten age-matched female flies of the same genotype were placed in a vial marked with a line drawn horizontally 8\u2009cm above the surface. The flies were gently tapped to the bottom surface and given 10\u2009s to demonstrate climbing activity as a negative geotaxic response. After 10\u2009s, the number of flies that successfully climbed above the 8-cm line was recorded. This assay was repeated 10 times and the averaged data were represented as percentages where the number of flies above the 8-cm mark was divided by the total number of flies tested within each group. For each negative geotaxis assay, a minimum of 10 groups (100 flies) per genotype was tested69. How to cite this article: Ruan, K. et al.

Here, we show that, in mouse,  is expressed in the inner ear and the protein localizes to the neuronal fibers innervating cochlear and utricular auditory hair cells. Downstream of receptor kinase (), the  homolog of human , is expressed in Johnston's organ (JO), the fly hearing organ, and the loss of  in JO causes scolopidium abnormalities.  mutant flies present deficits in negative geotaxis behavior, which can be suppressed by human wild-type but not mutant GRAP. Furthermore, drk specifically colocalizes with synapsin at synapses, suggesting a potential role of such adaptor proteins in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics in the nervous system. Our findings establish a causative link between  mutation and nonsyndromic deafness and suggest a function of GRAP/drk in hearing.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT  Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the major dose-limiting side effect of many commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, including paclitaxel. Currently, there are no neuroprotective or effective symptomatic treatments for CIPN. Lack of understanding of the  in vivo  mechanisms of CIPN has greatly impeded the identification of therapeutic targets. Here, we optimized a model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy using  Drosophila  larvae that recapitulates aspects of chemotherapy-induced sensory dysfunction .  We showed that nociceptive sensitivity is associated with disrupted organization of microtubule-associated MAP1B/Futsch and aberrant stabilization of peripheral sensory dendrites. These findings establish a robust and amenable model for studying peripheral mechanisms of CIPN. Using this model, we uncovered a critical role for nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat) in maintaining the integrity and function of peripheral sensory neurons and uncovered Nmnat9s therapeutic potential against diverse sensory symptoms of CIPN.",

        "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential biomolecule involved in many critical processes. Its role as both a driver of energy production and a signaling molecule underscores its importance in health and disease. NAD signaling impacts multiple processes that are dysregulated in cancer, including DNA repair, cell proliferation, differentiation, redox regulation, and oxidative stress. Distribution of NAD is highly compartmentalized, with each subcellular NAD pool differentially regulated and preferentially involved in distinct NAD-dependent signaling or metabolic events. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting NAD metabolism is likely to repress many specific mechanisms underlying tumor development and progression, including proliferation, survival, metabolic adaptations, invasive capabilities, heterotypic interactions with the tumor microenvironment, and stress response including notably DNA maintenance and repair. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of how compartmentalized NAD metabolism in mitochondria, nucleus, cytosol, and extracellular space impacts cancer formation and progression, along with a discussion of the therapeutic potential of NAD-targeting drugs in cancer.",

        "abstract": "Defects in mitochondrial biogenesis and function are common in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD). We have previously shown that in yeast models of HD, enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis through overexpression of Hap4, the catalytic subunit of the transcriptional complex that regulates mitochondrial gene expression, alleviates the growth arrest induced by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract peptides in rapidly dividing cells. However, the mechanism through which  overexpression exerts this protection remains unclear. Furthermore, it remains unexplored whether  overexpression and increased respiratory function during growth can also protect against polyQ-induced toxicity during yeast chronological lifespan. Here, we show that in yeast, mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are essential for protection against the polyQ-induced growth defect by  overexpression. In addition, we show that not only increased  levels, but also alternative interventions, including calorie restriction, that result in enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis confer protection against polyQ toxicity during stationary phase. The data obtained in yeast models guided experiments in a fly model of HD, where we show that enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis can also protect against neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits. Our results suggest that therapeutic interventions aiming at the enhancement of mitochondrial respiration and OXPHOS could reduce polyQ toxicity and delay disease onset.",

Currently there are no neuroprotective or effective symptomatic treatments for CIPN. Lack of understanding of the  mechanisms of CIPN has greatly impeded the identification of therapeutic targets. Here we optimized a model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy using  larvae that recapitulates aspects of chemotherapy-induced sensory dysfunction We showed that nociceptive sensitivity is associated with disrupted organization of microtubule associated MAP1B/Futsch and aberrant stabilization of peripheral sensory dendrites. These findings establish a robust and amenable model for studying peripheral mechanisms of CIPN. Using this model, we uncovered a critical role for Nmnat in maintaining the integrity and function of peripheral sensory neurons and uncovered Nmnat's therapeutic potential against diverse sensory symptoms of CIPN.",

        "abstract": "With the rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, it is increasingly important to understand the underlying pathophysiology that leads to neuronal dysfunction and loss. Fluorescence-based imaging tools and technologies enable unprecedented analysis of subcellular neurobiological processes, yet there is still a need for unbiased, reproducible, and accessible approaches for extracting quantifiable data from imaging studies. We have developed a simple and adaptable workflow to extract quantitative data from fluorescence-based imaging studies using Drosophila models of neurodegeneration. Specifically, we describe an easy-to-follow, semi-automated approach using Fiji/ImageJ to analyze two cellular processes: first, we quantify protein aggregate content and profile in the Drosophila optic lobe using fluorescent-tagged mutant huntingtin proteins; and second, we assess autophagy-lysosome flux in the Drosophila visual system with ratiometric-based quantification of a tandem fluorescent reporter of autophagy. Importantly, the protocol outlined here includes a semi-automated segmentation step to ensure all fluorescent structures are analyzed to minimize selection bias and to increase resolution of subtle comparisons. This approach can be extended for the analysis of other cell biological structures and processes implicated in neurodegeneration, such as proteinaceous puncta (stress granules and synaptic complexes), as well as membrane-bound compartments (mitochondria and membrane trafficking vesicles). This method provides a standardized, yet adaptable reference point for image analysis and quantification, and could facilitate reliability and reproducibility across the field, and ultimately enhance mechanistic understanding of neurodegeneration.",

        "abstract": "Understanding individual daily activity patterns is essential for travel demand management and urban planning. This research introduces a new method to infer individuals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 activities from their mobile phone traces. Using Metro Boston as an example, we develop an activity detection model with travel diary surveys to reveal the common laws governing individuals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 activity participation, and apply the modeling results to mobile phone traces to extract the embedded activity information. The proposed approach enables us to spatially and temporally quantify, visualize, and examine urban activity landscapes in a metropolitan area and provides real-time decision support for the city. This study also demonstrates the potential value of combining new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big data\u00e2\u20ac such as mobile phone traces and traditional travel surveys to improve transportation planning and urban planning and management.",

        "abstract": " paper presents an overview of the design and status of a new type of land-use simulation module integrated into SimMobility, an agent-based microsimulation platform. The module, SimMobility Long-Term (LT), is designed to simulate how the interrelations between the transportation and land-use systems manifest themselves in the housing and commercial real estate markets, household and firm location choices, school and workplace choices, and vehicle ownership choices. At the heart of the LT simulator is a housing market module simulating daily dynamics in the residential housing market that (a) \u201cawakens\u201d households that begin searching for new housing; (b) accounts for eligibility, affordability, and screening constraints; (c) constructs plausible choice sets; (d) simulates daily housing market bidding; and (e) represents developer behavior regarding when, where, what type, and how much built space to construct, taking into account market cycle and uncertainty. The LT simulator and SimMobility\u2019s activity-based, mid-term (MT) simulator are integrated in that the agents in the LT module (e.g., individuals in households) are the same agents simulated in the MT module (e.g., activity participation and trip-making), and agents\u2019 simulated behaviors in the MT module provide measures of (utility-based) accessibility that figure into relevant decisions in the LT simulator. This paper describes the SimMobility model and the LT framework, presents estimation results for two component models of the housing supply side, and demonstrates the use of the simulator by comparing housing market outcomes with and without the introduction of one year\u2019s worth of supply of new public housing. Overall, the LT simulator represents an effort to advance urban system modelling by explicitly simulating the dynamic interactions of disaggregated agents in real estate markets and encapsulating the information of agents\u2019 daily activity participation in their long-term mobility-relevant choices.",

        "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that interleukin-8 (IL-8) play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of cancer through the modulation of tumour immune response or enhanced angiogenesis. A single nucleotide polymorphism, -251A/T, has been identified in the promoter region of the IL-8 gene and has been shown to influence its production. Results from previous studies on the association of -251A/T polymorphism with different cancer types remained contradictory. To assess the effect of -251A/T of IL-8 on cancer susceptibility, we conducted a meta-analysis, up to May 2009, of 14,876 cases with different cancer types and 18,465 controls from 45 published case-control studies. Summary odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for IL-8 polymorphism and cancer were estimated using fixed- and random-effects models when appropriate. The AA/AT genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma when compared with TT genotype (OR=1.48; 95% CI, 1.16-1.89). Moreover, significantly elevated risks were observed in 'other cancers', and also in African population when population is concerned. Interestingly, when stratified separately by population-based studies and hospital-based studies, significantly elevated risk was found among hospital-based studies (OR=1.21, 95% CI, 1.07-1.37), whereas significantly decreased risk was found among population-based studies (OR=0.90, 95% CI, 0.83-0.97). This meta-analysis shows that IL-8 -251A/T polymorphism may play a complex role in cancer development.",

        "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC). Accumulated evidence suggests an association between MMP-1, MMP-7, and MMP-9 functional gene polymorphisms with several tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at MMP-1 16071G/2G, MMP-7 181A/G, and MMP-9 279R/Q genes with CRC in the southwest Chinese Han population. The study used 237 CRC patients and 252 normal control matched by age and sex from Sichuan province in China. Samples were genotyped using both polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing. We found significant differences in the genotype and allele frequency of MMP-9 279\u2009R/Q between the case and control group. Individuals who carried MMP-9 279 R allele were more susceptible to CRC (odds ratio = 1.737, 95% confidence interval = 1.323-2.281, p < 0.001). Moreover, the RR genotype of MMP-9 279\u2009R/Q was associated with an increased risk of CRC compared with the QQ genotype (odds ratio = 2.213, 95% confidence interval = 1.248-3.926, p = 0.006). However, there were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequency of the MMP-1 16071G/2G and MMP-7 181\u2009A/G between the case and control group, and the latter may be due to lower minor allele frequency. The MMP-9 279R/Q alleles and genotypes may be associated with the risk of CRC in Han Chinese.",

The A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 33 (ADAM33) gene, located on chromosome 20p13, has recently been identified as an asthma-susceptibility gene by positional cloning. Recently, it has been reported that ADAM33 contributed to PS risk in the French population and white North Americans. To observe the relationship between ADAM33 gene and PS, a case-control study was conducted in a Han Chinese population. Three polymorphic sites (T1, T2, and V4) were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 106 patients with PS and 125 healthy controls. We observed a decreased frequency in the CG genotype and GG genotype of ADAM33 rs2787094 (V4) in cases compared with controls (p = 0.045, odds ratio = 0.461, 95% confidence interval = 0.215-0.992, and p = 0.044, odds ratio = 0.447, 95% confidence interval = 0.203-0.987, respectively).

Methods: Adult healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups Cischemia(MI): non-ischemia(NI), sham-operated(SO) and normal control (NO) groups]. The expression of SSB and \u03b2-actin gene in the myocardium was examined by real time PCR at 0 min. 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Results: The expression of SSB gene was down-regulated after ischemia. Significantly lower expression of the gene in the rats with myocardial ischemia was found at 120 min after ligation compared with those before ligation and the control group at 120 min after ligation (P <0. 05). However, no significant differences were found between other groups (P>0. 05). Conclusion: SSB gene may be involved in the pathophysiologic regulating process in myocardial cells at the early stage of myocardial ischemia in rats.",

        "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that RAD51 plays a pivotal role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and the maintenance of genomic stability. A single nucleotide polymorphism, 135G/C, has been identified in the 5' untranslated region of the RAD51 gene and has been shown to influence gene transcription activity. Previous studies yielded conflicting results as to the association of 135G/C polymorphism with breast cancer. We aimed to assess the effect of 135G/C of RAD51 on breast cancer susceptibility with the use of a meta-analysis. We performed a meta-analysis of 21 published case-control studies up to April 2010. We found that the CC genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer when compared with the GG, CG, and CG/GG genotypes. Subgroup analyses showed that individuals carrying the CC genotype were associated with an elevated tumor risk in European populations and in sporadic breast cancer. After stratified analyses according to manuscript quality, the CC genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer compared with the CG genotype in studies of both higher and lower quality. However, significantly elevated risk was found in studies of higher quality, but not in studies of lower quality when homozygote and a recessive comparison model were tested. This meta-analysis indicates that RAD51 135G/C polymorphism may be identified as a susceptibility locus for breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the degradation changes of \u03b2-actin mRNA and 18S rRNA in different time points and temperature after death, and to explore the relationship between the changes and postmortem interval (PMI) in the brain of mice. Methods Twenty-four health adult C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into two groups(12 each group). They were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and placed in chamber with two different temperature(4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, humidity was 80%). The mice brains were sampled at 6 different time points (immediately, 0.5 h, 2h, 6h, 24 h, 48 h ) , and total brainRNA were extracted. Ct value of each sample was obtained using RT-PCR and real-time PCR technology, and \u03b23-actin mRNA and 18S rRNA content ratiowas calculated. The correlation between the content ratio and PMI was expressed using statistical regression analysis. Results At 37 \u00b0C, RNA degradation rate was faster than 4 \u00b0 , which showed that there was correlation between temperature and RNA degradation. Comparing with the stability of\u03b23-actin mRNA, 18S rRNA was more stable. Conclusion The study on degradation of \u03b23-aetin mRNA and 18S rRNA in mice brain using real time PCRtechnology could provide a new theoretical basis for estimation of PMI and would be supplementary to the traditional methods.",

As compared with neural networks, support Vector Machine (SVM) is based on statistical learning theory, which has advantages of better classification ability and generalization performance. The marr wavelet kernel is adopted as the kernel function of SVM. Based on this, a novel analog circuit fault diagnosis method which is called wavelet kernel support vector machine is proposed in the paper. Using principal component analysis (PCA) as a tool for extracting fault features, the WSVM is then applied to the analog circuit fault diagnosis.

        "abstract": "Fault diagnosis of analog circuit is of essential importance for guaranteeing the reliability and maintainability of electronic systems. Taking into account the requirements and characteristics of analog circuit fault diagnosis, two-level diagnostic structure for analog circuit is proposed in this paper. Analog circuit fault diagnosis can be regarded as a pattern recognition issue and addressed by multi-class SVM. Aiming at the uncertainty of the node arrangement and the error accumulation phenomenon, the improved directed acyclic graph support vector machine (DAGSVM) based on fisher separability measure in high dimensional feature space and margin of SVM is proposed. In order to eliminate redundant fault features and the impact of measure noise on the diagnostic accuracy, simultaneously taking into account lightening the workload of the classifier, the separability promotion algorithm based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) plus linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is proposed. Then the separability promotion algorithm is used to extract the nonlinear fault features of analog circuit and the two-level structure based on improved DAGSVM is applied to diagnose faults in analog circuit. The unbalanced classification model based on SVM is adopted in the first level. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the experimental results. \u00a9 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

        "abstract": "The Bacillus subtilis clpX and clpP genes are the sites of pleiotropic mutations that adversely affect growth on a variety of media and impair developmental processes such as sporulation and competence development. ClpX is necessary for the post-exponential induction of genes that require the sigmaH form of RNA polymerase for transcription. Both ClpX and ClpP are required for the activation of sigmaA-dependent transcription of the srf operon that encodes surfactin synthetase and the regulatory peptide ComS, required for the development of genetic competence. Transcription of srf is activated by the two-component regulatory system ComPA in response to the peptide pheromone, ComX, which mediates cell density-dependent control. A clpX mutant, although able to produce ComX, is unable to respond to the pheromone. A mutant allele of comP, encoding a product whose activity is independent of ComX, is not able to suppress clpX with respect to srf expression, suggesting that ClpXP acts at the level of ComA-dependent activation of srf transcription initiation. Suppressor mutations of clpX (cxs-1 and cxs-2) were isolated in screens for pseudorevertants exhibiting high levels of srf expression and sigmaH-dependent transcription respectively. One mutation, cxs-1, suppressed a clpP null mutation with respect to srf transcription, but did not overcome the block conferred by clpP on competence development and sporulation. Both cxs-1 and cxs-2 mutations map to the region of the rpoA gene encoding the RNA polymerase alpha C-terminal domain (alphaCTD). The reconstruction of the cxs-1 and cxs-2 alleles of rpoA confirmed that these mutations confer the suppressor phenotype. These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that ClpX and ClpP might be intimately associated with transcription initiation in B. subtilis.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in clpP and clpX have pleiotropic effects on growth and developmentally regulated gene expression in Bacillus subtilis. ClpP and ClpX are needed for expression of comK, encoding the competence transcription factor required for the expression of genes within the competence regulon. ClpP, in combination with the ATPase ClpC, degrades the inhibitor of ComK, MecA. Proteolysis of MecA is stimulated by a small protein, ComS, which interacts with MecA. Suppressor mutations (cxs) were isolated that bypass the requirement for clpX for comK expression. These were found also to overcome the defect in comK expression conferred by a clpP mutation. These mutations were identified as missense mutations (cxs-5, -7 and -12) and a nonsense (UAG) codon substitution (cxs-10) in the yjbD coding sequence in a locus linked to mecA. That a yjbD disruption confers the cxs phenotype, together with its complementation by an ectopically expressed copy of yjbD, indicated that the suppressor alleles bear recessive, loss-of-function mutations of yjbD. ClpP- and ClpX-independent comK expression rendered by inactivation of yjbD was still medium-dependent and required ComS. MecA levels in a clpP-yjbD mutant were lower that those of clpP mutant cells and ComK protein concentration in the clpP mutant was restored to wild-type levels by the yjbD mutation. Consequently, the yjbD mutation bypasses the defect in competence development conferred by clpP and clpX. YjbD protein is barely detectable in wild-type cells, but is present in large amounts in the clpP mutant cells. The results suggest that the role of ClpP in competence development is to degrade YjbD protein so that ComS can productively interact with the MecA-ClpC-ComK complex. Alternatively, the result could suggest that YjbD has a negative effect on regulated proteolysis and that MecA is degraded independently of ClpP when YjbD is absent.",

        "abstract": "The Bacillus subtilis ResD-ResE two-component regulatory system activates genes involved in nitrate respiration in response to oxygen limitation or nitric oxide (NO). The sensor kinase ResE activates the response regulator ResD through phosphorylation, which then binds to the regulatory region of genes involved in anaerobiosis to activate their transcription. ResE is composed of an N-terminal signal input domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The N-terminal domain contains two transmembrane subdomains and a large extracytoplasmic loop. It also has a cytoplasmic PAS subdomain between the HAMP linker and C-terminal kinase domain. In an attempt to identify the signal-sensing subdomain of ResE, a series of deletions and amino acid substitutions were generated in the N-terminal domain. The results indicated that cytoplasmic ResE lacking the transmembrane segments and the extracytoplasmic loop retains the ability to sense oxygen limitation and NO, which leads to transcriptional activation of ResDE-dependent genes. This activity was eliminated by the deletion of the PAS subdomain, demonstrating that the PAS subdomain participates in signal reception. The study also raised the possibility that the extracytoplasmic region may serve as a second signal-sensing subdomain. This suggests that the extracytoplasmic region could contribute to amplification of ResE activity leading to the robust activation of genes required for anaerobic metabolism in B. subtilis.",

        "abstract": "The Bacillus subtilis ResD-ResE two-component signal transduction system is essential for aerobic and anaerobic respiration. A spontaneous suppressor mutant that expresses ResD-controlled genes and grows anaerobically in the absence of the ResE histidine kinase was isolated. In addition, aerobic expression of ResD-controlled genes in the suppressed strain was constitutive and occurred at a much higher level than that observed in the wild-type strain. The suppressing mutation, which mapped to pgk, the gene encoding 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, failed to suppress a resD mutation, suggesting that the suppressing mutation creates a pathway for phosphorylation of the response regulator, ResD, which is independent of the cognate sensor kinase, ResE. The pgk-1 mutant exhibited very low but measurable 3-phosphoglycerate kinase activity compared to the wild-type strain. The results suggest that accumulation of a glycolytic intermediate, probably 1, 3-diphosphoglycerate, is responsible for the observed effect of the pgk-1 mutation on anaerobiosis of resE mutant cells.",

        "abstract": "The two-component regulatory proteins ResD and ResE are required for anaerobic nitrate respiration in Bacillus subtilis. ResD, when it undergoes ResE-dependent phosphorylation, is thought to activate transcriptionally anaerobically induced genes such as fnr, hmp and nasD. In this report, deletion analysis of the fnr, hmp and nasD promoter regions was carried out to identify cis-acting sequences required for ResDE-dependent transcription. The results suggest that the hmp and nasD promoters have multiple target sequences for ResDE-dependent regulation and that fnr has a single target site. Gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting analyses were performed to determine whether ResD interacts directly with the regulatory regions of the three genes. Our results indicate that ResD specifically binds to sequences residing upstream of the hmp and nasD promoters and that phosphorylation of ResD significantly stimulates this binding. In contrast, a higher concentration of ResD is required for binding to the fnr promoter region and no stimulation of the binding by ResD phosphorylation was observed. Taken together, these results suggest that ResD activates transcription of fnr, hmp and nasD by interacting with DNA upstream of these promoters. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of ResD stimulates binding to multiple ResD binding sites, but is much less stimulatory if only a single binding site exists.",

        "abstract": "The nitrate and nitrite reductases of Bacillus subtilis have two different physiological functions. Under conditions of nitrogen limitation, these enzymes catalyze the reduction of nitrate via nitrite to ammonia for the anabolic incorporation of nitrogen into biomolecules. They also function catabolically in anaerobic respiration, which involves the use of nitrate and nitrite as terminal electron acceptors. Two distinct nitrate reductases, encoded by narGHI and nasBC, function in anabolic and catabolic nitrogen metabolism, respectively. However, as reported herein, a single NADH-dependent, soluble nitrite reductase encoded by the nasDE genes is required for both catabolic and anabolic processes. The nasDE genes, together with nasBC (encoding assimilatory nitrate reductase) and nasF (required for nitrite reductase siroheme cofactor formation), constitute the nas operon. Data presented show that transcription of nasDEF is driven not only by the previously characterized nas operon promoter but also from an internal promoter residing between the nasC and nasD genes. Transcription from both promoters is activated by nitrogen limitation during aerobic growth by the nitrogen regulator, TnrA. However, under conditions of oxygen limitation, nasDEF expression and nitrite reductase activity were significantly induced. Anaerobic induction of nasDEF required the ResDE two-component regulatory system and the presence of nitrite, indicating partial coregulation of NasDEF with the respiratory nitrate reductase NarGHI during nitrate respiration.",

        "abstract": "The ResD-ResE signal transduction system is required for transcription of genes involved in aerobic and anaerobic respiration in Bacillus subtilis. Phosphorylated ResD (ResD approximately P) interacts with target DNA to activate transcription. A strong sequence similarity was detected in promoter regions of some ResD-controlled genes including fnr and resA. Single-base substitutions in the fnr and resA promoters were performed to determine a ResD-binding sequence. DNase I footprinting analysis indicated that ResD approximately P itself does not bind to fnr, but interaction of ResD approximately P with the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit (alphaCTD) of RNA polymerase (RNAP) facilitates cooperative binding of ResD approximately P and RNAP, thereby increasing fnr transcription initiation. Consistent with this result, amino acid substitutions in alphaCTD, such as Y263A, K267A, A269I, or N290A, sharply reduced fnr transcription in vivo, and the K267A alphaCTD protein, unlike the wild-type protein, did not increase ResD approximately P binding to the fnr promoter. Amino acid residues of alphaCTD required for ResD-dependent fnr transcription, with the exception of N290, which may interact with DNA, constitute a distinct surface, suggesting that these residues likely interact with ResD approximately P.",

        "title": "Cataract screening in a rural area of Southern China: a retrospective cohort study",
        "abstract": "Abstract  Background  Cataract is the leading cause of blindness and impaired vision worldwide; however, cataract surgery rate in China (1300 cases per million people per year) is lower than in Europe, America, and India (greater than 5000 cases per million people per year). In the past 10 years, a public health screening system has been established for early diagnosis and intervention of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension by the Disease Control and Prevention Centers (CDC) of China. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of screening for cataract on surgery rates in Guangdong, China.  Methods  Cataract screening was done by a non-profit eye hospital in the Zhao Qing area of Guangdong Province, together with public health screening by the local CDC. Demographic information, economic and education status, and rate of cataract surgery of the screening population were recorded. Awareness of cataract and access to ophthalmic examination and surgery were evaluated in randomly selected patients having surgery in villages by questionnaire. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center of Sun Yat-sen University. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient at the time of enrollment.  Findings  From March 1, 2015, to March 31, 2016, we screened 24\u2008254 people from five rural areas, 68 towns and 900 villages. Participants were aged 50\u2013108 years (mean 73\u00b79 [SD 8\u00b76]), 16\u2008128 (66\u00b75%) were female, 3640 (15\u00b70%) were from low income families, and 10\u2008733 (44\u00b73%) were illiterate. After screening, 20\u2008724 (85\u00b75%) participants were diagnosed with age-related cataracts, of which 8683 (41\u00b79%) had visual acuity of 0\u00b73 or less and were recommended for cataract surgery. Surgery was performed on 4612 (53\u00b71%) recommended patients, of which 3978 (86\u00b72%) were from villages, 330 (7\u00b72%) were from towns, and 305 (6\u00b76%) were from counties. Phacoemulsification was done on 3926 (85\u00b71%) patients, and 686 (14\u00b79%) had extracapsular cataract extraction. Implanted unfoldable intraocular lenses were provided to 3009 (72\u00b73%) patients at no cost, and 1153 (27\u00b77%) paid \u00a51000 for foldable IOL implants. The uncorrected visual acuity of 2368 (51\u00b73%) patients who had surgery was more than 0\u00b75 at 1 month after surgery. The cataract surgery rate for the Zhao Qing area was 1060\u00b724 in 2012, 1018\u00b729 in 2013, and 1519\u00b776 in 2014. However, the rate dramatically increased (1\u00b78 times vs 2014) to 2739\u00b751 in 2015 when free cataract screening was available. 500 patients completed the questionnaire. 15 (3\u00b70%) patients refused to respond and 12 (2\u00b74%) patients did not understand the questions asked. The results showed that 2606 (56\u00b75%) respondents did not have any ophthalmic examinations in the preceding 5 years, and 2372 (51\u00b74%) respondents were unaware of cataract before screening.  Interpretation  Cataract screening in collaboration with the CDC is a low-cost, highly effective and practicable strategy to disseminate cataract knowledge and eliminate cataract blindness. This screening model offers regional integrated collaborative service based on public health information platform, solves information and service isolation problems, and saves the medical resources.

        "abstract": "Abstract  Background  China has the highest number of people with diabetes in the world, with a diabetes prevalence of 11\u00b76% and prediabetes prevalence of 50\u00b71%. In China, diabetes self-management support is poorly implemented, with low adherence to self-care recommendations. Effective strategies to assist patients in managing diabetes are therefore urgently needed. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a novel self-management model plus family doctor team support for patients with type 2 diabetes.  Methods  This randomised controlled trial was done in Longfeng Street Community Health Service Center (LSCHSC) in Guangdong province, southern China. Patients with type 2 diabetes with no hepatic or renal dysfunction, mental illness, or language disorders were eligible. Patients were randomly selected (using computer-generated randomisation numbers) from the diabetic archives in LSCHSC, and assigned (1:1) to either the intervention or control group, also using a computer-generated randomisation list. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were not masked to group assignment. Each patient in the intervention group signed a contract with the family doctor team of LSCHSC. Standard operating procedures for follow-up management were developed for patients in the intervention group, and an individual medical record system was established to monitor lifestyle interventions. Additionally, patientsu0027 family doctor teams provided training on healthy lifestyle self-management for the patients and their family members (eg, lectures and consultations, in-person interviews, diabetic clubs, and diabetes outreach activities), which is ongoing. Patients in the control group were provided with regular health education. The primary endpoint was laboratory measures and fundus disorders at 18 months after initiation of the intervention, analysed in the per-protocol population. The study was approved by the ethics committee of LSCHSC, and informed consent was obtained from each participant.  Findings  Between March 1, 2015, and May 31, 2015, 600 adults with type 2 diabetes were enrolled (300 to the intervention group and 300 to the control group). Baseline demographic, clinical characteristics, and laboratory measures were similar between groups. After 18 months of follow-up, 263 participants in the intervention group and 278 in the control group remained in the study and were analysed. Concentrations of several laboratory measures were significantly lower in intervention group than the control group (triglyceride, p=0\u00b70082; total cholesterol, p=0\u00b7001; low-density lipoprotein, p=0\u00b7002; urinary creatinine, p=0\u00b7001; fasting blood glucose, p 1c  (p=0\u00b710), urinary albumin (p=0\u00b730), and the ratio of urinary albumin to urinary creatinine (p=0\u00b724) were noted between the two groups. The proportion of patients with diabetic retinopathy (stage R0) did not significantly differ between the two groups (37 [11%] of 346 eyes in the intervention group vs 50 [12%] of 432 eyes in the control group; p=0\u00b775).  Interpretation  Type 2 diabetes self-management with support from a family doctor team in a community health service centre might be an effective strategy to control disease progression and improve patientsu0027 quality of life. Benefits to ocular complication of diabetes need further investigation.

        "abstract": "The most common complication after cataract surgery is postoperative capsular opacification, which includes anterior capsular opacification (ACO) and posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Increased adhesion of lens epithelial cells (LECs) to the intraocular lens material surface promotes ACO formation, whereas proliferation and migration of LECs to the posterior capsule lead to the development of PCO. Cell adhesion is mainly mediated by the binding of integrin to extracellular matrix proteins, while cell proliferation and migration are regulated by fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Syndecan-4 (SDC-4) is a co-receptor for both integrin and FGF signaling pathways. Therefore, SDC-4 may be an ideal therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of postoperative capsular opacification. However, how SDC-4 contributes to FGF-mediated proliferation, migration, and integrin-mediated adhesion of LECs is unclear. Here, we found that downregulation of SDC-4 inhibited FGF signaling through the blockade of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation, thus suppressing cell proliferation and migration. In addition, downregulation of SDC-4 suppressed integrin-mediated cell adhesion through inhibiting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation. Moreover, SDC-4 knockout mice exhibited normal lens morphology, but had significantly reduced capsular opacification after injury. Finally, SDC-4 expression level was increased in the anterior capsule LECs of age-related cataract patients. Taken together, we for the first time characterized the key regulatory role of SDC-4 in FGF and integrin signaling in human LECs, and provided the basis for future pharmacological interventions of capsular opacification.",

        "abstract": "Objectives  Depression and depressive symptoms are common mental disorders that have a considerable effect on patients\u2019 health-related quality of life and satisfaction with medical care, but the prevalence of these conditions varies substantially between published studies. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a precise estimate of the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among outpatients in different clinical specialties.  Design  Systematic review and meta-analysis.  Data sources and eligibility criteria  The PubMed and PsycINFO, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify observational studies that contained information on the prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms in outpatients. All studies included were published before January 2016. Data characteristics were extracted independently by two investigators. The point prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms was measured using validated self-report questionnaires or structured interviews. Assessments were pooled using a random-effects model. Differences in study-level characteristics were estimated by meta-regression analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using standard \u03c7 2  tests and the I 2  statistic. The study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO under number CRD42017054738.  Results  Eighty-three cross-sectional studies involving 41\u2009344 individuals were included in this study. The overall pooled prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms was 27.0% (10\u2009943/41\u2009344 individuals; 95% CI 24.0% to 29.0%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (p 2 =0.3742, I 2 =96.7%). Notably, a significantly higher prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms was observed in outpatients than in the healthy controls (OR 3.16, 95%\u2009CI 2.66 to 3.76, I 2 =72.0%, \u03c7  2  =25.33). The highest depression/depressive symptom prevalence estimates occurred in studies of outpatients from otolaryngology clinics (53.0%), followed by dermatology clinics (39.0%) and neurology clinics (35.0%). Subgroup analyses showed that the prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms in different specialties varied from 17.0% to 53.0%. The prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms was higher among outpatients in developing countries than in outpatients from developed countries. Moreover, the prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms in outpatients slightly decreased from 1996 to 2010. Regarding screening instruments, the Beck Depression Inventory led to a higher estimate of the prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms (1316/4702, 36.0%, 95%\u2009CI 29.0% to 44.0%, I 2 =94.8%) than the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (1003/2025, 22.0%, 95%\u2009CI 12.0% to 35.0%, I 2 =96.6%).  Conclusion  Our study provides evidence that a significant proportion of outpatients experience depression or depressive symptoms, highlighting the importance of developing effective management strategies for the early identification and treatment of these conditions among outpatients in clinical practice. The substantial heterogeneity between studies was not fully explained by the variables examined.",

        "abstract": "Recent reform of medical education highlights the growing concerns about the capability of the current educational model to equip medical school students with essential skills for future career development. In the field of ophthalmology, although many attempts have been made to address the problem of the decreasing teaching time and the increasing load of course content, a growing body of literature indicates the need to reform the current ophthalmology teaching strategies. Flipped classroom is a new pedagogical model in which students develop a basic understanding of the course materials before class, and use in-class time for learner-centered activities, such as group discussion and presentation. However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the flipped classroom in ophthalmology education. This study, for the first time, assesses the use of flipped classroom in ophthalmology, specifically glaucoma and ocular trauma clerkship teaching. A total number of 44 international medical school students from diverse background were enrolled in this study, and randomly divided into two groups. One group took the flipped glaucoma classroom and lecture-based ocular trauma classroom, while the other group took the flipped ocular trauma classroom and lecture-based glaucoma classroom. In the traditional lecture-based classroom, students attended the didactic lecture and did the homework after class. In the flipped classroom, students were asked to watch the prerecorded lectures before the class, and use the class time for homework discussion. Both the teachers and students were asked to complete feedback questionnaires after the classroom. We found that the two groups did not show differences in the final exam scores. However, the flipped classroom helped students to develop skills in problem solving, creative thinking and team working. Also, compared to the lecture-based classroom, both teachers and students were more satisfied with the flipped classroom. Interestingly, students had a more positive attitude towards the flipped ocular trauma classroom than the flipped glaucoma classroom regarding the teaching process, the course materials, and the value of the classroom. Therefore, the flipped classroom model in ophthalmology teaching showed promise as an effective approach to promote active learning.",

These patients shared the same c.6499C\u202f>\u202fT missense mutation in the FRAS1-related extracellular matrix protein 2 (FREM2) gene, while each individual presented an additional nonsense mutation in the same gene (Patient #1, c.2206C\u202f>\u202fT; Patient #2, c.5309G\u202f>\u202fA; and Patient #3, c.4063C\u202f>\u202fT). Then, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mice carrying Frem2 compound heterozygous mutations, and showed that these mice recapitulated the human isolated cryptophthalmos phenotype. We detected FREM2 expression in the outer plexiform layer of the retina for the first time in the cryptophthalmic eyes, and the levels were comparable to the wild-type mice. Moreover, a set of different expressed genes that may contribute secondarily to the phenotypes were identified by performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the fetal Frem2 mutant mice. Our findings extend the spectrum of FREM2 mutations, and provide insights into opportunities for the prenatal diagnosis of isolated cryptophthalmos. Furthermore, our work highlights the importance of the FREM2 protein during the development of eyelids and the anterior segment of the eyeballs, establishes a suitable animal model for studying epithelial reopening during eyelid development and serves as a valuable reference for further mechanistic studies of the pathogenesis of isolated cryptophthalmos.",

In mouse lens, Sprouty2 (Spry2) has a negative regulatory role on TGF\u03b2 signaling. However, the regulation of Spry2 during ASC development and how Spry2 modulates TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway in human LECs have not been characterized. Here, we demonstrate that Spry2 expression level is decreased in anterior capsule LECs of ASC patients. Spry2 negatively regulates TGF\u03b22-induced EMT and migration of LECs through inhibition of Smad2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Also, blockade of Smad2 or ERK1/2 activation suppresses EMT caused by Spry2 downregulation. Collectively, our results for the first time show in human LECs that Spry2 has an inhibitory role in TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. Our findings in human lens tissue and epithelial cells suggest that Spry2 may become a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of ASC and capsule opacification. ",

A large emergent photoinduced electric field of up to 20\u00d710^{6}\u2009\u2009V/m is discovered in a surface layer of the crystal, which then drives polarization and lattice dynamics that are dramatically distinct in a surface layer versus bulk regions. A dynamical phase-field modeling method is developed that reveals the microscopic origin of these dynamics, leading to gigahertz polarization and elastic waves traveling in the crystal with sonic speeds and spatially varying frequencies. The advances in spatiotemporal imaging and dynamical modeling tools open up opportunities for disentangling ultrafast processes in complex mesoscale structures such as ferroelectric domains.",

        "abstract": "Dynamical phase separation during a solid-solid phase transition poses a challenge for understanding the fundamental processes in correlated materials. Critical information underlying a phase transition, such as localized phase competition, is difficult to reveal by measurements that are spatially averaged over many phase separated regions. The ability to simultaneously track the spatial and temporal evolution of such systems is essential to understanding mesoscopic processes during a phase transition. Using state-of-the-art time-resolved hard x-ray diffraction microscopy, we directly visualize the structural phase progression in a VO2 film upon photoexcitation. Following a homogenous in-plane optical excitation, the phase transformation is initiated at discrete sites and completed by the growth of one lattice structure into the other, instead of a simultaneous isotropic lattice symmetry change. The time-dependent x-ray diffraction spatial maps show that the in-plane phase progression in laser-superheated VO2 is via a displacive lattice transformation as a result of relaxation from an excited monoclinic phase into a rutile phase. The speed of the phase front progression is quantitatively measured, and is faster than the process driven by in-plane thermal diffusion but slower than the sound speed in VO2. The direct visualization of localized structural changes in the time domain opens a new avenue to study mesoscopic processes in driven systems.",

We have found that these exotic structures, non-existent in the bulk ferroelectrics, possess rich ultrafast responses to fs laser excitation, which is attractive for high-density information storage and nanoscale actuation. Using optical pulse excitation above the bandgap of PbTiO3 layers and structural and second harmonic generation probes of ferroelectric order dynamics, a series of reversible and irreversible nano-ordering transitions were observed. X-ray diffraction and diffuse scattering on nanodomains aided the phase identification during time-resolved measurements. In this talk, we will discuss the dynamic interplay between collinear and toroidal ferroelectric domains aided by understanding from phase field modelling. [1] A.K. Yadav, R.

        "abstract": "Many chalcogenide glasses undergo a breakdown in electronic resistance above a critical field strength. Known as threshold switching, this mechanism enables field-induced crystallization in emerging phase-change memory. Purely electronic as well as crystal nucleation assisted models have been employed to explain the electronic breakdown. Here, picosecond electric pulses are used to excite amorphous Ag_{4}In_{3}Sb_{67}Te_{26}. Field-dependent reversible changes in conductivity and pulse-driven crystallization are observed. The present results show that threshold switching can take place within the electric pulse on subpicosecond time scales-faster than crystals can nucleate. This supports purely electronic models of threshold switching and reveals potential applications as an ultrafast electronic switch. ",

The strong electron-lattice interactions in correlated electron systems provide unique opportunities for altering the material properties with relative ease and flexibility. In this Rapid Communication, we use localized strain control via a focused-ion-beam patterning of TiO2 substrates to demonstrate that one can selectively engineer the insulator-to-metal transition temperature, the fractional component of the insulating and metallic phases, and the degree of optical anisotropy down to the length scales of the intrinsic phase separation in VO2 thin films without altering the quality of the films. The effects of localized strain control on the strongly correlated electron system are directly visualized by state-of-the-art IR near-field imaging and spectroscopy techniques and x-ray microdiffraction measurements.",

The in-situ measurements of both magnetic and lattice order parameters allow direct comparison of their time evolutions without ambiguity. We found that the magnetic order recovers with two time constants. The fast sub- nanosecond recovery is associated with the re-establishment of three dimensional antiferromagnetic order while the slow one agrees with the lattice cooling on tens of nanoseconds. The strong oscillating behavior of magnetic order during the long time recovery may be related to complicated dynamics of defect-pinned magnetic domains.",

        "abstract": "The combination of ultrafast optical excitation and time-resolved synchrotron x-ray nanodiffraction provides unique insight into the photoinduced dynamics of materials, with the spatial resolution required to probe individual nanostructures or small volumes within heterogeneous materials. Optically excited x-ray nanobeam experiments are challenging because the high total optical power required for experimentally relevant optical fluences leads to mechanical instability due to heating. For a given fluence, tightly focusing the optical excitation reduces the average optical power by more than three orders of magnitude and thus ensures sufficient thermal stability for x-ray nanobeam studies. Delivering optical pulses via a scannable fiber-coupled optical objective provides a well-defined excitation geometry during rotation and translation of the sample and allows the selective excitation of isolated areas within the sample. Experimental studies of the photoinduced lattice dynamics of a 35 nm BiFeO3 thin film on a SrTiO3 substrate demonstrate the potential to excite and probe nanoscale volumes. ",

        "abstract": "Nanoscale phonon transport is a key process that governs thermal conduction in a wide range of materials and devices. Creating controlled phonon populations by resonant excitation at terahertz (THz) frequencies can drastically change the characteristics of nanoscale thermal transport and allow a direct real-space characterization of phonon mean-free paths. Using metamaterial-enhanced terahertz excitation, we tailored a phononic excitation by selectively populating low-frequency phonons within a nanoscale volume in a ferroelectric $mathrm{BaTi}{mathrm{O}}_{3}$ thin film. Real-space time-resolved x-ray diffraction microscopy following THz excitation reveals ballistic phonon transport over a distance of hundreds of nm, two orders of magnitude longer than the averaged phonon mean-free path in $mathrm{BaTi}{mathrm{O}}_{3}$. On longer length scales, diffusive phonon transport dominates the recovery of the transient strain response, largely due to heat conduction into the substrate. The measured real-space phonon transport can be directly compared with the phonon mean-free path as predicted by molecular dynamics modeling. This time-resolved real-space visualization of THz-matter interactions opens up opportunities to engineer and image nanoscale transient structural states with new functionalities.",

        "abstract": "The dynamical processes associated with electric field manipulation of the polarization in a ferroelectric remain largely unknown but fundamentally determine the speed and functionality of ferroelectric materials and devices. Here we apply subpicosecond duration, single-cycle terahertz pulses as an ultrafast electric field bias to prototypical BaTiO3 ferroelectric thin films with the atomic-scale response probed by femtosecond x-ray-scattering techniques. We show that electric fields applied perpendicular to the ferroelectric polarization drive large-amplitude displacements of the titanium atoms along the ferroelectric polarization axis, comparable to that of the built-in displacements associated with the intrinsic polarization and incoherent across unit cells. This effect is associated with a dynamic rotation of the ferroelectric polarization switching on and then off on picosecond time scales. These transient polarization modulations are followed by long-lived vibrational heating effects driven by resonant excitation of the ferroelectric soft mode, as reflected in changes in the c-axis tetragonality. The ultrafast structural characterization described here enables a direct comparison with first-principles-based molecular-dynamics simulations, with good agreement obtained. (Less)",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Currently, the pollution of metals and metalloids in the soil has attracted considerable attention. Phytoremediation is considered an environmentally friendly means of remediating pollution, but often takes a long time to perform. Therefore, the combination of plants and nanomaterials in environmental management has attracted the attention of many researchers because some nanomaterials can promote the germination of plant seeds and the growth of whole plants. However, when the concentration of nanomaterials is not controlled properly, certain toxicity will be produced. This paper reviews research on the combination of plant and nanomaterials for the remediation of contaminated environments, as well as on the effects of nanomaterials on plants.",

        "abstract": "Compost or composting has been widely investigated under the background of heavy metal pollution of agricultural soils and rapid growth of organic wastes. Compost is rich in nutrients, humic matter, and microorganisms; it may be added to agricultural soil as a fertilizer to improve soil fertility and promote the growth of crops and microorganisms, and as a soil amendment to relieve heavy metal pollution. However, the effectiveness and security of compost application in agricultural soil continue to generate concern. In this review, the efficacy and mechanisms of compost remediation technologies for heavy metal-contaminated agricultural soil are presented. Poor quality, unsuitability for multiple heavy metal-contaminated soils, and potential long-term risks are the main limitations of the effectiveness and security of compost application to soils. Therefore, improving the quality of the compost, adding amendments, or combining with phytoremediation may be considered when adopting compost to remediate polluted agricultural soil. In addition, we propose several approaches to optimize these strategies and render the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated agricultural soil using compost safer and more effective. The findings of this review will help support the large-scale application of compost in agriculture in the future.",

Here a near infrared monolayer MoTe2 light emitting diode (LED) has been demonstrated and its emission wavelength is transparent to silicon. By taking advantage of the quantum tunneling effect, the device has achieved a very high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.5% at 83 K, which is the highest EQE obtained from LED devices fabricated from monolayer TMDs so far. When the device is operated as a photodetector, the MoTe2 device exhibits a strong photoresponsivity at resonant wavelength 1145 nm. The low dark current of ~5pA and fast response time 5.06 ms are achieved due to suppression of hBN tunneling layer. Our results open a new route for the investigation of novel near infrared silicon integrated optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "The performance of optoelectronic devices based on monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (mTMD) semiconductors is significantly affected by the contact at the mTMD-metal interface, which is dependent on interlayer interactions and coupling. Here, we report a systematic optical method to investigate the interlayer charge transfer and coupling in a mTMD-metal heterojunction. Giant photoluminescence (PL) quenching was observed in a monolayer MoS2/Pd (1L MoS2/Pd) junction which is mainly due to the efficient interlayer charge transfer between Pd and MoS2. 1L MoS2/Pd also exhibits an increase in the PL quenching factor (\u03b7) as the temperature decreases, due to a reduction of the interlayer spacing. Annealing experiments were also performed which supported interlayer charge transfer as the main mechanism for the increase of \u03b7. Moreover, a monolayer MoS2/Au (1L MoS2/Au) junction was fabricated for engineering the interlayer charge transfer. Interestingly, a narrowing effect of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) was encountered as the junctions changed from 1L MoS2/SiO2 \u2192 1L MoS2/Au \u2192 1L MoS2/Pd, possibly originating from a change of the doping level induced weakening of exciton-carrier scattering. Our results deepen the understanding of metal-semiconductor junctions for further exploring fundamental phenomena and enabling high-performance devices using mTMD-metal junctions.",

We observe that the single InGaAs/InP quantum well embedded in the nanowire consists of three components with different chemical compositions, axial quantum well, ring quantum well and radial quantum well respectively, leading to the electroluminescence emission with multiple wavelengths. The electroluminescence measurements show a strong dependence on current injection levels as well as temperatures and these are explained by interpreting the equivalent circuits in a minimized area of the device. It is also found that the electroluminescence properties are closely related to the distinctive triangular morphology with an inclined facet of the quantum well nanowire. Our study provides important new insights for further design, growth and fabrication of high performance quantum well-based nanowire light sources for a wide range of future optoelectronic and photonic applications.",

        "abstract": "The fundamental light-matter interactions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides might be significantly engineered by hybridization with their organic counterparts, enabling intriguing optoelectronic applications. Here, atomically thin organic-inorganic (O-I) heterostructures, comprising monolayer MoSe and mono-/few-layer single-crystal pentacene samples, are fabricated. These heterostructures show type-I band alignments, allowing efficient and layer-dependent exciton pumping across the O-I interfaces. The interfacial exciton pumping has much higher efficiency (>86 times) than the photoexcitation process in MoSe , although the pentacene layer has much lower optical absorption than MoSe . This highly enhanced pumping efficiency is attributed to the high quantum yield in pentacene and the ultrafast energy transfer between the O-I interface. Furthermore, those organic counterparts significantly modulate the bindings of charged excitons in monolayer MoSe via their precise dielectric environment engineering. The results open new avenues for exploring fundamental phenomena and novel optoelectronic applications using atomically thin O-I heterostructures.",

However, monolayer MoS2 is still a weak photon emitter, compared with other direct band gap semiconductors, which requires extra techniques or complicated steps to enhance its photon emission efficiency. Here, we demonstrated that nanostructured monolayer MoS2, produced by one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth, shows highly enhanced PL emission. The effective enhancement factor could be up to \u223c43. Our results open the door to manipulating the optical properties of future devices by using nanostructured 2D monolayers. ",

        "abstract": "In this work, we show how domain engineered lithium niobate can be used to selectively dope monolayer molybdenum selenide (MoSe2) and tungsten selenide (WSe2) and demonstrate that these ferroelectric domains can significantly enhance or inhibit photoluminescence (PL) with the most dramatic modulation occurring at the heterojunction interface between two domains. A micro-PL and Raman system is used to obtain spatially resolved images of the differently doped transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The domain inverted lithium niobate causes changes in the TMDs due to electrostatic doping as a result of the remnant polarization from the substrate. Moreover, the differently doped TMDs (n-type MoSe2 and p-type WSe2) exhibit opposite PL modulation. Distinct oppositely charged domains were obtained with a 9-fold PL enhancement for the same single MoSe2 sheet when adhered to the positive (P+) and negative (P-) domains. This sharp PL modulation on the ferroelectric domain results from different free electron or hole concentrations in the materials conduction band or valence band. Moreover, excitons dissociate rapidly at the interface between the P+ and P- domains due to the built-in electric field. We are able to adjust the charge on the P+ and P- domains using temperature via the pyroelectric effect and observe rapid PL quenching over a narrow temperature range illustrating the observed PL modulation is electronic in nature. This observation creates an opportunity to harness the direct bandgap TMD 2D materials as an active optical component for the lithium niobate platform using domain engineering of the lithium niobate substrate to create optically active heterostructures that could be used for photodetectors or even electrically driven optical sources on-chip.",

        "abstract": "While reports suggest a single dose of senolytics may improve vasomotor function, the structural and functional impact of long\u2010term senolytic treatment is unknown. To determine whether long\u2010term senolytic treatment improves vasomotor function, vascular stiffness, and intimal plaque size and composition in aged or hypercholesterolemic mice with established disease. Senolytic treatment (intermittent treatment with Dasatinib + Quercetin via oral gavage) resulted in significant reductions in senescent cell markers (TAF + cells) in the medial layer of aorta from aged and hypercholesterolemic mice, but not in intimal atherosclerotic plaques. While senolytic treatment significantly improved vasomotor function (isolated organ chamber baths) in both groups of mice, this was due to increases in nitric oxide bioavailability in aged mice and increases in sensitivity to NO donors in hypercholesterolemic mice. Genetic clearance of senescent cells in aged normocholesterolemic INK\u2010ATTAC mice phenocopied changes elicited by D+Q. Senolytics tended to reduce aortic calcification (alizarin red) and osteogenic signaling (qRT\u2013PCR, immunohistochemistry) in aged mice, but both were significantly reduced by senolytic treatment in hypercholesterolemic mice. Intimal plaque fibrosis (picrosirius red) was not changed appreciably by chronic senolytic treatment. This is the first study to demonstrate that chronic clearance of senescent cells improves established vascular phenotypes associated with aging and chronic hypercholesterolemia, and may be a viable therapeutic intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases.",

        "title": "Targeting senescent cholangiocytes and activated fibroblasts with B-cell lymphoma-extra large inhibitors ameliorates fibrosis in multidrug resistance 2 gene knockout (Mdr2-/- ) mice",
        "abstract": "Cholangiocyte senescence has been linked to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Persistent secretion of growth factors by senescent cholangiocytes leads to the activation of stromal fibroblasts (ASFs), which are drivers of fibrosis. The activated phenotype of ASFs is characterized by an increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Here, we examined the mechanisms of apoptotic priming in ASFs and explored a combined targeting strategy to deplete senescent cholangiocytes and ASFs from fibrotic tissue to ameliorate liver fibrosis. Using a coculture system, we determined that senescent cholangiocytes promoted quiescent mesenchymal cell activation in a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent manner. We also identified B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) as a key survival factor in PDGF-activated human and mouse fibroblasts. Bcl-xL was also up-regulated in senescent cholangiocytes. In vitro, inhibition of Bcl-xL by the small molecule Bcl-2 homology domain 3 mimetic, A-1331852, or Bcl-xL-specific small interfering RNA induced apoptosis in PDGF-activated fibroblasts, but not in quiescent fibroblasts. Likewise, inhibition of Bcl-xL reduced the survival and increased apoptosis of senescent cholangiocytes, compared to nonsenescent cells. Treatment of multidrug resistance 2 gene knockout (Mdr2\u2212/\u2212) mice with A-1331852 resulted in an 80% decrease in senescent cholangiocytes, a reduction of fibrosis-inducing growth factors and cytokines, decrease of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin\u2013positive ASFs, and finally in a significant reduction of liver fibrosis. Conclusion: Bcl-xL is a key survival factor in ASFs as well as in senescent cholangiocytes. Treatment with the Bcl-xL-specific inhibitor, A-1331852, reduces liver fibrosis, possibly by a dual effect on activated fibroblasts and senescent cholangiocytes. This mechanism represents an attractive therapeutic strategy in biliary fibrosis. (Hepatology 2018;67:247-259).",

        "abstract": "Adipose tissue inflammation and dysfunction are associated with obesity-related insulin resistance and diabetes, but mechanisms underlying this relationship are unclear. Although senescent cells accumulate in adipose tissue of obese humans and rodents, a direct pathogenic role for these cells in the development of diabetes remains to be demonstrated. Here, we show that reducing senescent cell burden in obese mice, either by activating drug-inducible \"suicide\" genes driven by the p16 promoter or by treatment with senolytic agents, alleviates metabolic and adipose tissue dysfunction. These senolytic interventions improved glucose tolerance, enhanced insulin sensitivity, lowered circulating inflammatory mediators, and promoted adipogenesis in obese mice. Elimination of senescent cells also prevented the migration of transplanted monocytes into intra-abdominal adipose tissue and reduced the number of macrophages in this tissue. In addition, microalbuminuria, renal podocyte function, and cardiac diastolic function improved with senolytic therapy. Our results implicate cellular senescence as a causal factor in obesity-related inflammation and metabolic derangements and show that emerging senolytic agents hold promise for treating obesity-related metabolic dysfunction and its complications.",

        "abstract": "Cellular senescence entails a stable cell-cycle arrest and a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype, which contributes to aging and age-related diseases. Obesity is associated with increased senescent cell burden and neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression. To investigate the role of senescence in obesity-related neuropsychiatric dysfunction, we used the INK-ATTAC mouse model, from which p16-expressing senescent cells can be eliminated, and senolytic drugs dasatinib and quercetin. We found that obesity results in the accumulation of senescent glial cells in proximity to the lateral ventricle, a region in which adult neurogenesis occurs. Furthermore, senescent glial cells exhibit excessive fat deposits, a phenotype we termed \"accumulation of lipids in senescence.\" Clearing senescent cells from high fat-fed or leptin receptor-deficient obese mice restored neurogenesis and alleviated anxiety-related behavior. Our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that senescent cells are major contributors to obesity-induced anxiety and that senolytics are a potential new therapeutic avenue for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "Senescent cells accumulate with aging and at sites of pathology in multiple chronic diseases. Senolytics are drugs that selectively promote apoptosis of senescent cells by temporarily disabling the pro-survival pathways that enable senescent cells to resist the pro-apoptotic, pro-inflammatory factors that they themselves secrete. Reducing senescent cell burden by genetic approaches or by administering senolytics delays or alleviates multiple age- and disease-related adverse phenotypes in preclinical models. Reported senolytics include dasatinib, quercetin, navitoclax (ABT263), and piperlongumine. Here we report that fisetin, a naturallyoccurring flavone with low toxicity, and A1331852 and A1155463, selective BCL-X-L inhibitors that may have less hematological toxicity than the less specific BCL-2 family inhibitor navitoclax, are senolytic. Fisetin selectively induces apoptosis in senescent but not proliferating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). It is not senolytic in senescent IMR90 cells, a human lung fibroblast strain, or primary human preadipocytes. A1331852 and A1155463 are senolytic in HUVECs and IMR90 cells, but not preadipocytes. These agents may be better candidates for eventual translation into clinical interventions than some existing senolytics, such as navitoclax, which is associated with hematological toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Transcripts of key enzymes in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism in mouse livers are significantly increased after chronic high-fat/high-sucrose feeding. UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (GALE) is the last enzyme in this pathway that converts UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose and was previously identified as a downstream target of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress effector spliced X-box binding protein 1, suggesting an interesting cross talk between galactose and glucose metabolism in the context of hepatic ER stress and whole-body metabolic fitness. However, its specific role in glucose metabolism is not established. Using an inducible and tissue-specific mouse model, we report that hepatic overexpression of  Gale  increases gluconeogenesis from pyruvate and impairs glucose tolerance. Conversely, genetic reduction of  Gale  in liver improves glucose tolerance. Transcriptional profiling identifies trefoil factor 3 ( Tff3 ) as one of the downstream targets of GALE. Restoration of  Tff3  expression corrects glucose intolerance in  Gale -overexpressing mice. These studies reveal a new link between hepatic GALE activity and whole-body glucose homeostasis via regulation of hepatic  Tff3  expression.",

The sizes of hyaluronic acid polymers range from 5000 to 20,000,000\u202fDa  in vivo , and the functions of HA are largely dictated by its size. Due to its high biocompatibility, HA has been commonly used as soft tissue filler as well as a major component of biomaterial scaffolds in tissue engineering. Several studies have implicated that HA may promote differentiation of adipose tissue derived stem cells  in vitro  or  in vivo  when used as a supporting scaffold. However, whether HA actually promotes adipogenesis  in vivo  and the subsequent metabolic effects of this process are unclear. This review summarizes some recent publications in the field and discusses the possible directions and approaches for future studies, focusing on the role of HA in the adipose tissue.",

        "abstract": "The synthesis of lipid and sterol species through de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is regulated by two functionally overlapping but distinct transcription factors: the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP). ChREBP is considered to be the dominant regulator of DNL in adipose tissue (AT); however, the SREBPs are highly expressed and robustly regulated in adipocytes, suggesting that the model of AT DNL may be incomplete. Here we describe a new mouse model of inducible, adipocyte-specific overexpression of the insulin-induced gene 1 (Insig1), a negative regulator of SREBP transcriptional activity. Contrary to convention, Insig1 overexpression did block AT lipogenic gene expression. However, this was immediately met with a compensatory mechanism triggered by redox activation of mTORC1 to restore SREBP1 DNL gene expression. Thus, we demonstrate that SREBP1 activity sustains adipocyte lipogenesis, a conclusion that has been elusive due to the constitutive nature of current mouse models.",

UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (GALE) is the last enzyme in this pathway that converts UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose and was previously identified as a downstream target of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress effector spliced X-box binding protein 1, suggesting an interesting cross talk between galactose and glucose metabolism in the context of hepatic ER stress and whole-body metabolic fitness. However, its specific role in glucose metabolism is not established. Using an inducible and tissue-specific mouse model, we report that hepatic overexpression of  increases gluconeogenesis from pyruvate and impairs glucose tolerance. Conversely, genetic reduction of  in liver improves glucose tolerance. Transcriptional profiling identifies trefoil factor 3 () as one of the downstream targets of GALE. Restoration of  expression corrects glucose intolerance in -overexpressing mice. These studies reveal a new link between hepatic GALE activity and whole-body glucose homeostasis via regulation of hepatic  expression.",

To explore whether mice display human-like fat depots in anatomically comparable regions, we mapped fat depots using glucose or fatty acid imaging tracers, such as F-FDG through PET/CT or [I]-\u03b2-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid with SPECT/CT imaging, to analogous depots in mice. Using this type of image analysis with both probes, we define a large number of additional areas of high metabolic activity corresponding to novel fat pads. Histological and gene expression analyses validate these regions as bona fide fat pads. Our findings indicate that fat depots of rodents show a high degree of topological similarity to those of humans. Studies involving both glucose and lipid tracers indicate differential preferences for these substrates in different depots and also suggest that fatty acid-based visualized approaches may reveal additional brown adipose tissue and beige depots in humans.",

Here, we test the hypothesis that the potential to recruit new adipocytes from Pdgfr\u03b2 preadipocytes determines visceral WAT health in obesity. We manipulate levels of Pparg, the master regulator of adipogenesis, in Pdgfr\u03b2 precursors of adult mice. Increasing the adipogenic capacity of Pdgfr\u03b2 precursors through Pparg overexpression results in healthy visceral WAT expansion in obesity and adiponectin-dependent improvements in glucose homeostasis. Loss of mural cell Pparg triggers pathologic visceral WAT expansion upon high-fat diet feeding. Moreover, the ability of the TZD class of anti-diabetic drugs to promote healthy visceral WAT remodeling is dependent on mural cell Pparg. These data highlight the protective effects of de novo visceral adipocyte differentiation in these settings, and suggest Pdgfr\u03b2 adipocyte precursors as targets for therapeutic intervention in diabetes.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the joint learning of action recognition and temporal localization in long, untrimmed videos. We employ a multi-task learning framework that performs the three highly related steps of action proposal, action recognition, and action localization refinement in parallel instead of the standard sequential pipeline that performs the steps in order. We develop a novel temporal actionness regression module that estimates what proportion of a clip contains action. We use it for temporal localization but it could have other applications like video retrieval, surveillance, summarization, etc. We also introduce random shear augmentation during training to simulate viewpoint change. We evaluate our framework on three popular video benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our joint model is efficient in terms of storage and computation in that we do not need to compute and cache dense trajectory features, and that it is several times faster than its sequential ConvNets counterpart. Yet, despite being more efficient, it outperforms stateof-the-art methods with respect to accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Analyzing videos of human actions involves understanding the temporal relationships among video frames. State-of-the-art action recognition approaches rely on traditional optical flow estimation methods to pre-compute motion information for CNNs. Such a two-stage approach is computationally expensive, storage demanding, and not end-to-end trainable. In this paper, we present a novel CNN architecture that implicitly captures motion information between adjacent frames. We name our approach hidden two-stream CNNs because it only takes raw video frames as input and directly predicts action classes without explicitly computing optical flow. Our end-to-end approach is 10x faster than its two-stage baseline.

In this paper, we introduce dilated convolution and occlusion reasoning into unsupervised optical flow estimation to address these issues. The dilated convolution allows our network to avoid upsampling via deconvolution and the resulting gridding artifacts. Dilated convolution also results in a smaller memory footprint which speeds up interference. The occlusion reasoning prevents our network from learning incorrect deformations due to occluded image regions during training.

        "abstract": "Multimedia researchers have exploited large collections of community-contributed geo-referenced images to better understand a particular image, such as its subject matter or where it was taken, as well as to better understand a geographic location, such as the most visited tourist spots in a city or what the local cuisine is like. The goal of this paper is to better understand location. In particular, we use geo-referenced image collections to better understand what occurs in different parts of a city at fine spatial and activity class scales. This problem is known as land use mapping in the geographical sciences. We propose a novel framework to perform fine-grained land use mapping at the city scale using ground-level images. Mapping land use is considerably more difficult than mapping land cover and is generally not possible using overhead imagery as it requires close-up views and seeing inside buildings. We postulate that the growing collections of geo-referenced, ground-level images suggest an alternate approach to this geographic knowledge discovery problem. We develop a general framework that uses Flickr images to map 45 different land-use classes for the city of San Francisco, CA, USA. Individual images are classified using a novel convolutional neural network containing two streams: one for recognizing objects and another for recognizing scenes. This network is trained in an end-to-end manner directly on the labeled training images. We propose several novel strategies to overcome the noisiness of our user-generated data including search-based training set augmentation and online adaptive training. We derive a ground truth map of San Francisco in order to evaluate our method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through geovisualization and quantitative analysis. Our framework achieves over 29% recall at the individual land parcel level that represents a strong baseline for the challenging 45-way land use classification problem, especially given the noisiness of the image data.",

Ground-level images and videos provide a different perspective than overhead imagery and can be applied to a range of applications such as land use mapping, activity detection, pollution mapping, etc. The sparse and uneven distribution of this data presents a problem, however, for generating dense maps. We therefore investigate the problem of spatially interpolating the high-dimensional features extracted from sparse social media to enable dense labeling using standard classifiers. Further, we show how prior knowledge about region boundaries can be used to improve the interpolation through spatial morphing kernel regression. We show that an interpolate-then-classify framework can produce dense maps from sparse observations but that care must be taken in choosing the interpolation method. We also show that the spatial morphing kernel improves the results.",

We first address UAR as a Generalised Multiple-Instance Learning (GMIL) problem and discover u0027building-blocksu0027 from the large-scale ActivityNet dataset using distribution kernels. Essential visual and semantic components are preserved in a shared space to achieve the UR that can efficiently generalise to new datasets.

For novel tasks with limited labeled data, the prevalent approach is to transfer the knowledge learned in the pre-trained models to the new tasks by fine-tuning. Classic model fine-tuning utilizes the fact that well trained neural networks appear to learn cross domain features. These features are treated equally during transfer learning. In this paper, we explore the impact of feature selection in model fine-tuning by introducing a transfer module, which assigns weights to features extracted from pre-trained models. The proposed transfer module proves the importance of feature selection for transferring models from source to target domains. It is shown to significantly improve upon fine-tuning results with only marginal extra computational cost. We also incorporate an auxiliary classifier as an extra regularizer to avoid over-fitting. Finally, we build a Gated Transfer Network (GTN) based on our transfer module and achieve state-of-the-art results on six different tasks.",

        "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art approaches to video understanding adopt temporal jittering to simulate analyzing the video at varying frame rates. However, this does not work well for multirate videos, in which actions or subactions occur at different speeds. The frame sampling rate should vary in accordance with the different motion speeds. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective strategy, termed random temporal skipping, to address this situation. This strategy effectively handles multirate videos by randomizing the sampling rate during training. It is an exhaustive approach, which can potentially cover all motion speed variations. Furthermore, due to the large temporal skipping, our network can see video clips that originally cover over 100 frames. Such a time range is enough to analyze most actions/events. We also introduce an occlusion-aware optical flow learning method that generates improved motion maps for human action recognition. Our framework is end-to-end trainable, runs in real-time, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on six widely adopted video benchmarks.",

We develop a deep learning-based classifier that predicts the emotion conveyed by an image. This allows us to associate sentiment with place. We perform spatial hotspot detection and show that different emotions have distinct spatial distributions that match expectations. We also perform temporal analysis using the capture time of the photos. Our spatio-temporal hotspot detection correctly identifies emerging concentrations of specific emotions and year-by-year analyses of select locations show there are strong temporal correlations between the predicted emotions and known events.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the problem of representing an entire video using CNN features for human action recognition. End-to-end learning of CNN/RNNs is currently not possible for whole videos due to GPU memory limitations and so a common practice is to use sampled frames as inputs along with the video labels as supervision. However, the global video labels might not be suitable for all of the temporally local samples as the videos often contain content besides the action of interest. We therefore propose to instead treat the deep networks trained on local inputs as local feature extractors. The local features are then aggregated to form global features which are used to assign video-level labels through a second classification stage. We investigate a number of design choices for this local feature approach. Experimental results on the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets show that a simple maximum pooling on the sparsely sampled local features leads to significant performance improvement.",

        "abstract": "We study the unsupervised learning of CNNs for optical flow estimation using proxy ground truth data. Supervised CNNs, due to their immense learning capacity, have shown superior performance on a range of computer vision problems including optical flow prediction. They however require the ground truth flow which is usually not accessible except on limited synthetic data. Without the guidance of ground truth optical flow, unsupervised CNNs often perform worse as they are naturally ill-conditioned. We therefore propose a novel framework in which proxy ground truth data generated from classical approaches is used to guide the CNN learning. The models are further refined in an unsupervised fashion using an image reconstruction loss. Our guided learning approach is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art approaches on three standard benchmark datasets yet is completely unsupervised and can run in real time.",

Due to the great success of deep learning, recent work has focused on using CNNs to solve such dense prediction problems. In this paper, we investigate a new deep architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNet), to learn optical flow. This specific architecture is ideal for the problem at hand as it provides shortcut connections throughout the network, which leads to implicit deep supervision. We extend current DenseNet to a fully convolutional network to learn motion estimation in an unsupervised manner. Evaluation results on three standard benchmarks demonstrate that DenseNet is a better fit than other widely adopted CNN architectures for optical flow estimation.",

SCI results in longer post-TEVAR stay and hospital stay, but not associated with increased mortality. Robust precautions should be taken against underlying causes for post-TEVAR hypotension and low level of hemoglobin should be avoided.",

According to the basic principle of HWACT, the electromagnetic transient model of HWACT is built to analyze the fault transient process of transmission line. Based on fault characteristics of HWACT, the adaptability of traditional protections for transmission lines is analyzed briefly, such as current differential protection, distance protection and over current protection. In order to solve the problems of conventional protection caused by HWACT, a novel integrated protection based on multi-frequency domain information is proposed in this paper, which uses both the power frequency information and transient information. The integrated protection based on multi-frequency domain information takes advantages of power frequency and transient protections, which can not only improve the performance of traditional protection of AC transmission line but also realize fast fault judgment by transient travelling wave protection.",

        "abstract": "This paper is devoted to electromagnetic transient model and algorithm of inrush current and internal fault for power transformer. In the paper, it presents transformer model with excitation nonlinear characteristic based on the controlled source theory transformer simulation and damping trapezoidal algorithm. It simulates inrush current and internal fault by that model. When transformer inrush current phenomenon is simulated, usually piecewise linearization method will be adapted to solve the problem of transformer excitation saturation. However, after the comparison of simulated results with different step sizes, the paper finds it has overshoot distortion with larger step size and it increases simulation time with smaller step size. Therefore the paper proposes to predict next simulated exciting current during the simulation procedure. When predicted value is over the saturation threshold, exciting current revised formula will replace the original one. This method effectively solves overshoot distortion problem without decreasing simulation step size and improves simulation efficiency. On the basis of this simulation, it researches on transformer internal fault principle and modellings turn-to-turn short circuit internal fault for transformer. This model is able to simulate transformer turn-to-turn short circuit internal fault directly by setting up the parameter without any external circuit building. These models and algorithm are validated by test case.",

This paper modeled the half-wavelength line with the distributed parameter, researched the fault characteristics and the adaptability of phase-splitting steady current differential protection theoretically and through plenty of simulation work, and analyzed its influencing factors from three respects. The result indicates that conventional steady differential protection algorithm is not very suitable for half-wavelength transmission, the sensitivity of middle range is the biggest problem. Then adaptability of zero sequence current differential protection and differential protection based on deviation of power frequency component are researched, the simulation results indicate they have better sensitivity. The research result shows the differential protection can be set as backup protection, and need to coordinate with the quick protection which protect the range close to two ends.",

        "abstract": "A total of 200 smoking-related laryngeal carcinoma patients with pathology confirmation from the Eye and ENT Hospital and 190 high-risk smokers were included in a survey. All of the participants had a smoking index greater than 400 (cigarettes/day*year.) We obtained data on clinical and baseline characteristics, and peripheral blood was obtained and subjected to DNA extraction to analyse the correlation between smoking and the occurrence of laryngeal carcinoma. We selected candidate genes and SNP fragments that were found to be closely associated with smoking-related tumours in preliminary studies. The selected candidate genes were XPG, CYP1A1, OGG1, ERCC5, ERCC1, MMP2, and MMP9. We then performed SNP sequencing using Sequenom SNP detection technology. Target genes and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) fragments were evaluated to analyse the correlation between genotype or allele and smoking-related laryngeal carcinoma and to identify susceptibility genes related to laryngeal carcinoma. The results included four main findings: (1) The smoking index differed significantly between laryngeal cancer patients and control subjects (P=0.0035). The risk of laryngeal cancer was increased among individuals with a smoking index greater than 600 cigarettes/day*year (P=0.03). (2) The smoking index was significantly correlated with the T, N and clinical stages (P<0.05). (3) The polymorphisms CYP1A1-rs1048943, rs4646421, and rs4646422 and MMP9-rs17577 were significantly associated with laryngeal squamous carcinoma (P<0.05). (4) After stratifying the subjects by smoking degree, the GT genotype of ERCC1-rs2298881 was associated with a significantly greater risk of laryngeal carcinoma among heavy smokers (P=0.04). The results suggest that smoking plays an important role in the occurrence and development of laryngeal squamous carcinoma; CYP1A1 and MMP9 might be susceptibility gene SNPs for smoking-related laryngeal carcinoma, and ERCC1 might play an important role in heavy smokers. The results of this study might help identify an early marker for the detection and prevention of laryngeal carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is an aggressive malignancy with metastatic potential and high mortality worldwide. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of extracellular proteolytic enzymes. Although MMPs have been proved to be essential in the process of tumor migration and metastasis in most types of carcinomas, the expression and function of MMP2/3 in LSCC remain unknown. Here, we investigated the roles of MMP2/3 in LSCC and elucidated the underlying mechanism. We found that levels of MMP2/3 were significantly higher in clinical LSCC samples than in paired normal sample examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays. Moreover, overexpression of MMP2/3 promoted the proliferation and migration of LSCC cells by Cell Counting Kit-8, transwell, and scratch wound-healing assays in vitro. Furthermore, levels of epithelial cell markers (E-cadherin and occludin) were decreased following MMP2/3 overexpression, with increased levels of mesenchymal cell markers (N-cadherin and vimentin), suggesting the involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) process in MMP2/3-mediated LSCC cell migration. By using short hairpin RNA, knockdown of MMP2/3 expression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and EMT process in LSCC cells in vitro. More importantly, we confirmed that MMP2/3 promoted LSCC in the PI3K/Akt-NF-\u03baB-dependent manner. This study provides insight into MMP2/3-mediated LSCC development and lays a foundation for potential pharmacological targets to LSCC.",

The proposed strategy integrates three algorithms that represent three different types of existing methods in a layered system. The bottom-up architecture of this system is the main contribution of this paper. This architecture pursues reliable low-level layers that can independently work in as much cases as possible, and the high-level layer is used only when it is necessary for guaranteeing convergence in complex situations. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy has well combined the algorithms of different types from the perspective of pursuing reactivity in the premise of ensuring convergence. Compared with the traditional top-down hybrid architecture, the bottom-up architecture proposed in this paper is more suitable for multi-robot navigation since it can better utilize the advantages of different algorithms to deal with different situations.

This method adopts the concept of safe sectors in the vector field histogram (VFH) method, but simplifies its description. Moreover, the new method takes the threat of moving obstacles into account when selecting the direction of motion, and a new speed control law that considers more factors is designed. Hence, it is better at avoiding moving obstacles than the VFH method. Simulation results indicate that the new method also shows many advantages over the dynamic potential field (DPF) method, which is a representative approach for avoiding moving obstacles.

        "abstract": "Focusing on the navigation problem of mobile robots in environments with incomplete knowledge, a new hybrid navigation algorithm is proposed. The novel system architecture in the proposed algorithm is the main contribution of this paper. Unlike most existing hybrid navigation systems whose deliberative layers usually play the dominant role while the reactive layers are only simple executors, a more independent reactive layer that can guarantee convergence without the assistance of a deliberative layer is pursued in the proposed architecture, which brings two benefits. First, the burden of the deliberative layer is released, which is beneficial to guaranteeing real-time property and decreasing resource requirement. Second, some possible layer conflicts in the traditional architecture can be resolved, which improves the system stability. The convergence of the new algorithm has been proved. The simulation results show that compared with three traditional algorithms based on different architectures, the new hybrid navigation algorithm proposed in this paper performs more reliable in terms of escaping from traps, resolving conflicts between layers and decreasing the computational time for avoiding time out of the control cycle. The experiments on a real robot further verify the validity and applicability of the new algorithm.",

The validity of the proposed method for obstacles with convex boundaries has been proved. For some complicated obstacles with concave boundaries, simulation studies indicate that the proposed method is more reliable than some previous methods.

It is demonstrated that intense femtosecond\n laser pulses can be compressed by the nonlinear propagation in the transparent solids, and the temporal and spectral characteristics\n of output pulses were found to be significantly affected by the input laser intensity, with higher intensity corresponding\n to shorter compressed pulses. By the propagation in a 3mm thick BK7 glass plate with the laser power of GW level, a self-compression\n from 50 fs to 20 fs was achieved, with a compression factor of about 2.5. However, the output laser pulse was observed to\n split into two peaks when the input laser intensity is high enough to generate super-continuum and conical emission. When\n the input laser pulse is negatively chirped, the spectra of the pulse are reshaped and narrowed due to strong self-action\n effects, and the temporal pulse duration is found to be self-shortening. With the increase in the input pulse intensity, the\n resulted self-compressed pulses became even shorter than the input laser pulse, and also shorter than sech2 transform-limited pulse according to the corresponding spectra.\n ",

The pulse spectrum broadening and dispersion compensation compression phenomenon when focusing the laser pulse into bulk media are experimentally investigated. The 0.26 mJ, 50 fs laser pulse is focused into the bulk media, and the output spectrum width is broadened to nearly 40 nm. The beam maintains good quality and the spatial chirp of the laser beam is low because of the self-focusing phenomenon during the transmission in the bulk media. After compensating the positive chirp by the fussed silica prism pair, the pulse duration is compressed to 19 fs and the pulse energy is > 0.1 mJ with an efficiency of 35%. The pulse duration and the spectral phase are measured by SPIDER. The compressed laser pulse has quite good spatial profile and high contrast. The extracavity compression of high intensity femtosecond laser pulses has been carried out by use of bulk media, this method will be useful in the compression experiment on higher energy femtosecond laser pulse.",

It is demonstrated that high-power femtosecond laser pulses can be compressed by the nonlinear propagation in the transparent bulk media, and the temporal and spectral characteristics of resulted pulses were found to be significantly affected by the input laser intensity, with higher intensity corresponding to shorter compressed pulses. By the propagation in a piece of thin BK7 glass plate, a self-compression from 50fs to 20fs was achieved, with a compression factor of about 2.5. However, the output laser pulse was observed to be split into two peaks when the input laser intensity is high enough to generate supercontinuum and conical emission. When the input laser pulse is negatively chirped, the spectra of the pulse is reshaped and narrowed due to strong self-action effects, and the temporal pulse duration is found to be self-compressed, instead of broadening. With the increase in the input pulse intensity, the resulted self-compressed pulses became even shorter than the input laser pulse, and also shorter than sech 2 transform-limited pulse according to the corresponding spectra. The self-compression scheme is simple and robust, and it is promising as a new pulse compression method to achieve intense laser pulses of few cycles.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, environmentally friendly gelatin/-cyclodextrin (-CD) composite fiber adsorbents prepared by electrospinning were used for the removal of dyes from wastewater. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a universal materials tester were employed to characterize the internal structures, surface morphologies and mechanical strength of the composite fiber adsorbents. Additionally, the fiber was evaluated as an adsorbent for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. The effects of the raw material ratio, pH, temperature, concentration and adsorption time were studied. The results show that the gelatin/-CD composite fiber adsorbents possess excellent mechanical strength and high adsorption efficiency for MB. The adsorption equilibrium and adsorption kinetics are well-described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, respectively. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity is 47.4 mg\u00b7g. Additionally, after nine successive desorption-adsorption cycles, the removal rate is still over 70%. Moreover, the gelatin/-CD composite fiber adsorbents exhibit excellent adsorption capability for basic fuchsin, gentian violet, brilliant blue R and malachite green dyes. Therefore, owing to the characteristics of degradability, low cost and high-efficiency, the gelatin/-CD composite fiber can be used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of dyes from wastewater.",

Therefore, biodegradable and antibacterial dressings are eagerly desired. In this paper, gelatin/ZnO fibers were first prepared by side-by-side electrospinning for potential wound dressing materials. The morphology, composition, cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity were characterized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), particle size analyzer (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), thermogravimetry (TGA) and Incucyte\u2122 Zoom system. The results show that ZnO particles are uniformly dispersed on the surface of gelatin fibers and have no cytotoxicity. In addition, the gelatin/ZnO fibers exhibit excellent antibacterial activity against  () and  () with a significant reduction of bacteria to more than 90%. Therefore, such a biodegradable, nontoxic and antibacterial fiber has excellent application prospects in wound dressing.",

        "abstract": "As a degradable natural biomaterial, gelatin has good biocompatibility and nontoxicity, but gelatin is easily soluble in water which has limited its application. In order to solve this tough defect, superhydrophobic gelatin films (GSF) were prepared by first grafting silica nanoparticles onto gelatin films and then modifying silica nanoparticles with a fluorosilane coupling agent (FAS). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a particle size analyzer, a contact angle instrument (CA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a universal materials tester and an Incucyte\u2122 Zoom system were used to characterize the morphology, molecular interactions, superhydrophobic performance, and cytotoxicity. Results show that GSF300 modified by silica nanoparticles with a particle size of 303 nm has the largest contact angle (158.6\u00b0). At the same time, the contact angle is still more than 150\u00b0 after 48 hours of infiltration in water. These results indicate that GSF300 has strong long-term water resistance. In addition, GSF300 has good mechanical strength, durability and nontoxicity. Therefore, such a durable, robust and superhydrophobic film has good potential applications in various functional biomedical aspects.",

However, designing hydrogels with a combination of excellent mechanical properties, high sensitivity, and good biocompatibility is still a profound challenge. Here we report a conductive and biocompatible PVA\u2013Gelatin\u2013nHAP hydrogel (PGHAP gel) by connecting a double network with inorganic nano-particles via ionic bonds. The as-prepared gel achieves excellent elasticity and good fatigue resistance even after 50 cycles of compression. Then a hydrogel pressure sensor was obtained using the as-prepared gel, exhibiting high pressure sensitivity almost linearly responding up to 1.5 kPa and adequate stability of the capacitance\u2013pressure over 4 cycles. These results demonstrate the great potential applications of the hydrogel in biomedical devices, including artificial intelligence, human motion detection, and wearable devices.",

The effect of TiO2 amount and ultrasound time on the morphology, crystal and property of the product was studied. Taking methylene blue (MB) as model, the photocatalysis performance of the photocatalysts was observed.

The commonly used two-step protocol for extracting tryptic peptides, involving high-volume organic solvent extraction and cleanup via microscale reversed-phase micropipet tip or microcolumn is not only limited by significant sample loss but is also costly and very labor-intensive. We report here a simple one-step procedure for simultaneous peptide extraction and cleanup by incubating a small piece of C18 Empore Disk (3M) with the in-gel digested solution. We show that the direct Empore Disk-based peptide extraction procedure is convenient, economical, and has higher efficiency as compared with the commonly used two-step protocol for peptide preparation prior to MS analysis.",

This method utilized in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals to oxidize and covalently modify biomolecules on living Escherichia coli cell surface. After enriching and purifying the membrane proteome, the modified amino acid residues of the protein were identified with tandem mass spectrometry to map the solvent-accessible surface of the protein that will form the footprint of in vivo structure of the protein. Of about 100 outer membrane proteins identified, we investigated the structure details of a typical beta-barrel structure, the porin OmpF. We found that six modified tryptic peptides of OmpF were reproducibly detected with 19 amino acids modified under the physiological condition. The modified amino acid residues were widely distributed in the external loop area, beta-strands, and periplasmic turning area, and all of them were validated as solvent-accessible according to the crystallography data. We further extended this method to study the dynamics of the voltage gating of OmpF in vivo using mimic changes of physiological circumstance either by pH or by ionic strength. Our data showed the voltage gating of porin OmpF in vivo for the first time and supported the proposed mechanism that the local electrostatic field changes in the eyelet region may alter the porin channels to switch. Thus, this novel method can be a potentially efficient method to study the structural dynamics of the membrane proteins of a living cell.",

More than 3,000 non-redundant phosphorylation sites in over 1,200 proteins were identified in gastric cancer cells. We correlated phosphoproteome data with transcriptome data sets and reported the expression of 41 protein kinases, 5 phosphatases and 65 phosphorylated mitochondrial proteins in gastric cancer cells. Transcriptional expression levels of 190 phosphorylated proteins were >2-fold higher in gastric cancer cells compared to normal stomach tissue. Pathway analysis demonstrated over-presentation of DNA damage response pathway and underscored critical roles of phosphorylated p53 in gastric cancer. This is the first study to comprehensively report the gastric cancer phosphoproteome. Integrative analysis of the phosphoproteome and transcriptome provided an expansive view of molecular signaling pathways in gastric cancer.",

The workflow was superior to the default PQD setting when profiling the proteome of a gastric cancer cell line, SNU5. Taken together, we established an optimized PQD-CAD hybrid workflow in LTQ-MS for iTRAQ quantitative proteomic profiling that may have wide applications in biological and biomedical research.",

        "abstract": "Human monocytes' exposure to low-level lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces temporary monocytic insensitivity to subsequent LPS challenge. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon could have important clinical utilities in preventing and/or treating severe infections. In this study, we used an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to comprehensively characterize the membrane proteomes of monocytes before and after LPS exposure. We identified a total of 1651 proteins, of which 53.6% were membrane proteins. Ninety-four percent of the proteins were quantified and 255 proteins were shown to be tightly regulated by LPS. Subcellular location analysis revealed organelle-specific response to LPS exposure: more than 90% of identified mitochondrial membrane proteins were significant downregulated, whereas the majority of proteins from other organelles such as ER, Golgi and ribosome were upregulated. Moreover, we found that the expression of most receptors potentially involved in LPS signal pathway (CD14, toll-like receptor 4, CD11/CD18 complex) were substantially decreased, while the expression of molecules involved in LPS neutralization were enhanced after LPS challenge. Together, these findings could be of significance in understanding the mechanism of LPS tolerance and provide values for designing new approaches for regulating monocytic responses in sepsis patients.",

        "abstract": "We describe here a rapid method to determine the cyclic structure and disulfide linkages of highly stable cyclotides via a combination of flash partial acid hydrolysis, LC-MS/MS, and computational tools. Briefly, a mixture of closely related cyclotides, kalata B1 and varv A purified from Viola yedoensis was partially hydrolyzed in 2 M HCl for 5 min by microwave-assisted hydrolysis or for 30 min in an autoclave oven (121 degrees C and 15 psi). The partially hydrolyzed peptide mixture was then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis, with the disulfide linked-peptides fragmented by collision activated dissociation (CAD). A computer program written in-house (available for download at http://proteomics.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/cyclotide_SS ) was used for interpreting LC-MS/MS spectra and assigning the disulfide bonds. Time-point analysis of single-disulfide fragments revealed that nonrandom acid catalyzed fragmentation mostly occurred at the turns which are solvent-exposed and often contain side chain functionalized amino acids such as Asx/Glx and Ser/Thr. In particular, the most susceptible bond for acid hydrolysis in kalata B1 and varv A was found to be the highly conserved N25-G26 which is also the head-to-tail ligation site of the linear precursor proteins, indicating that formation of the three disulfide bonds might precede cyclic structure closure by N25-G26 ligation. This observation is consistent with the recent report that the N25-G26 bond formation is the last step in the cyclotide biosynthetic pathway. The process demonstrated here can potentially be a high throughput method that is generally applicable to determine disulfide bonds of other relatively low-abundance cyclotides.",

We have previously demonstrated the application of footprinting in live E. coli cells. Here, we further optimized an ultrafast laser photolysis hydroxyl radical footprinting method and applied it to study the interaction of EGF and EGFR in live mammalian cells. This method used a nanosecond laser to photochemically generate a burst of hydroxyl radicals in situ in-cell suspension to oxidize the amino acids on the protein surface. Mass spectrometric analysis of the thus modified peptides was interpreted to probe the solvent-accessible surface areas of the protein in its native biological state with and without EGF activation. Our footprinting data agreed with the two relevant EGFR crystal structures, indicating that this in-cell laser photolysis footprinting technique is a valid approach to study the structural properties of integral membrane proteins directly in the native environ...",

Proteome datasets for the 60 cell lines were acquired in duplicate within 30 working days using pressure cycling technology and SWATH mass spectrometry. We consistently quantified 3,171 proteotypic proteins annotated in the SwissProt database across all cell lines, generating a data matrix with 0.1% missing values, allowing analyses of protein complexes and pathway activities across all the cancer cells. Systematic and integrative analysis of the genetic variation, mRNA expression and proteomic data of the NCI-60 cancer cell lines uncovered complementarity between different types of molecular data in the prediction of the response to 240 drugs. We additionally identified novel proteomic drug response determinants for clinically relevant chemotherapeutic and targeted therapies. We anticipate that this study represents a significant advance toward the translational application of proteotypes, which reveal biological insights that are easily missed in the absence of proteomic data.",

Using OpenSWATH and pan-human spectral library, we quantified 11,787 proteotypic peptides from 2,579 SwissProt proteins in 76 HCC tissue samples within about 9 working days (from receiving tissue to SWATH data). The coefficient of variation (CV) of peptide yield using PCT was 32.9%, and the R2 of peptide quantification was 0.9729. We identified protein changes in malignant tissues compared to matched control samples in HCC patients, and further stratified patient samples into groups with high \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) expression or HBV infection. In aggregate, the data identified 23 upregulated pathways and 13 ones. We observed enhanced biomolecule synthesis and suppressed small molecular metabolism in liver tumor tissues. 16 proteins of high documented relevance to HCC are highlighted in our data. We also identified changes of virus-infection-related proteins including PKM, CTPS1 and ALDOB in the HBV+ HCC subcohort. In conclusion, we demonstrate the practicality of performing proteomic analysis of biopsy-level tissue samples with PCT-SWATH methodology with moderate effort and within a relatively short timeframe.",

However, comprehensive profiling of the serological proteome is challenging due to the wide range of protein concentrations in serum. : To address this challenge, we developed a novel in-depth serum proteomics platform capable of analyzing the serum proteome across ~10 orders or magnitude by combining data obtained from Data Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA-MS) and customizable antibody microarrays. : Using psoriasis as a proof-of-concept disease model, we screened 50 serum proteomes from healthy controls and psoriasis patients before and after treatment with traditional Chinese medicine (YinXieLing) on our in-depth serum proteomics platform. We identified 106 differentially-expressed proteins in psoriasis patients involved in psoriasis-relevant biological processes, such as blood coagulation, inflammation, apoptosis and angiogenesis signaling pathways. In addition, unbiased clustering and principle component analysis revealed 58 proteins discriminating healthy volunteers from psoriasis patients and 12 proteins distinguishing responders from non-responders to YinXieLing. To further demonstrate the clinical utility of our platform, we performed correlation analyses between serum proteomes and psoriasis activity and found a positive association between the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score with three serum proteins (PI3, CCL22, IL-12B). : Taken together, these results demonstrate the clinical utility of our in-depth serum proteomics platform to identify specific diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of psoriasis and other immune-mediated diseases.",

        "abstract": "Deterioration of biomolecules in clinical tissues is an inevitable pre-analytical process, which affects molecular measurements and thus potentially confounds conclusions from cohort analyses. Here, we investigate the degradation of mRNA and protein in 68 pairs of adjacent prostate tissue samples using RNA-Seq and SWATH mass spectrometry, respectively. To objectively quantify the extent of protein degradation, we develop a numerical score, the Proteome Integrity Number (PIN), that faithfully measures the degree of protein degradation. Our results indicate that protein degradation only affects 5.9% of the samples tested and shows negligible correlation with mRNA degradation in the adjacent samples. These findings are confirmed by independent analyses on additional clinical sample cohorts and across different mass spectrometric methods. Overall, the data show that the majority of samples tested are not compromised by protein degradation, and establish the PIN score as a generic and accurate indicator of sample quality for proteomic analyses.",

        "abstract": "Our previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of partition-herb moxibustion on ulcerative colitis (UC) rats. However, the mechanism of actions of partition-herb moxibustion is still unclear. Most Chinese acupuncturists believe that partition-herb improves the effect of moxibustion therapy. However, this argument lacks confirming experimental and clinical evidence. So, whether partition-herb does play a role in the mechanism of actions of partition-herb moxibustion was reported in this paper. A total of 123 patients were randomly divided into the partition-herb moxibustion group and the control group (partition-bran moxibustion group). Fourteen patients dropped out of the study. Finally, 109 patients finished the intervention. Sixty-one patients with UC received partition-herb moxibustion and 48 patients with UC received partition-bran moxibustion for 72 treatments, one treatment per day, every 12 treatments with an interval of 3 days. The expressions of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the colonic mucosa tissue in mild patients with UC were assayed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Histology of the colon also was observed at entry and after 72 treatments. Clinical therapeutic effect in partition-herb moxibustion was significantly better than those in partition-bran moxibustion (P < 0.05). Protein and mRNA expression of IL-8, ICAM-1 in the patients was inhibited by both partition-herb moxibustion and partition-bran moxibustion, of those the inhibition in the partition-herb moxibustion group was more obvious (P < 0.01). Partition-herb moxibustion was shown to significantly improve the histology of the colon, and partition-herb was shown to improve the therapeutic effect of moxibustion on treatment of UC patients.",

All rats were randomly divided into model control group (MC), electro-acupuncture group (EA), herbs-partition moxibustion group (HPM). Normal rats were used as normal control group (NC). Epithelial cell apoptosis and expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL proteins were detected by TUNEL and immunohistochemical method respectively.The number of epithelial cell apoptosis in MC was significantly higher than that in NC, and was markedly decreased after the treatment with herbs-partition moxibustion or electro-acupuncture. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL in colonic epithelial cells in MC was higher than that in NC, and was markedly down- regulated by herbs-partition moxibustion or electro-acupuncture treatment.The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis in rats involves abnormality of apoptosis. Acupuncture and moxibustion can regulate the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL proteins and inhibit the apoptosis of epithelial cells of ulcerative colitis in rats by Bcl-2/Bax, fas/FasL pathways.",

Moreover, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, substance P, and neurokinin-1 are involved in formation of central hyperalgesia. Thus, we postulated that the analgesic effect of herb-partitioned moxibustion may be associated with these factors. Accordingly, in this study, we established an inflammatory bowel disease visceral pain model in rat by enema with a mixed solution of 5% trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and 50% ethanol. Bilateral  (ST25) and  (CV6) points were selected for herb-partitioned moxibustion. Our results showed that herb-partitioned moxibustion improved visceral pain and down-regulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, substance P, and neurokinin-1 protein and mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia. These results indicate that down-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, substance P, and neurokinin-1 protein and mRNA may be a central mechanism for the analgesic effect of herb-partitioned moxibustion.",

Seven sets of ground motions were selected as representative of potential local seismic excitation and scaled to meet the provisions of China Seismic Code, GB50011-2001 (2008 version) and Shanghai Seismic Code, DGJ08-9-2003. A detailed and complex finite element model (FEM) of the structure was created within Perform 3D (2008), a widely used software program for nonlinear analysis and performance assessment of structures. Global behavior of the structure was checked to meet serviceability requirement. For performance acceptance criteria at the individual structural element level, GB50011-2001 and ASCE 41-06 \"Seismic Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings\" (2006) were used as major references. The nonlinear time history analyses confirmed acceptable global and local performances of Shanghai Tower as designed. \u00a9 ASCE 2011.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to be essential regulators in the development and progression of various cancers. The role of miR-188-5p in gastric cancer has not been determined. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-188-5p was downregulated in gastric cancer (GC) tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. And lowly expressed miR-188-5p was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage. Moreover, overexpression of miR-188-5p significantly inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion but promoted cellular apoptosis. In mechanism, we identified transcription factor ZFP91 as a target gene of miR-188-5p in GC. We found that miR-188-5p overexpression significantly inhibited the expression of ZFP91 in GC cell lines. And there was an inversely correlation between the expression of miR-188-5p and ZFP91 in GC tissues. What's more, we found that restoration of ZFP91 in miR-188-5poverexpressed MGC-803 and SGC-7901 cells promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Finally, we also showed that overexpression of miR-188-5p inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our findings indicated that miR-188-5p serves as a tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer by targeting ZFP91, suggesting that miR-188-5p might be a promising therapeutic target for GC treatment.",

By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analyses and mass spectroscopic identification, 10 protein spots were found significantly changed in pancreatic carcinoma and 5 proteins including cyclin I, Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor beta (GDI2), alpha-1 antitrypsin precursor, Haptoglobin precursor, and Serotransferrin precursor were successfully identified. The increased levels of cyclin I and GDI2 found to be associated with pancreatic carcinoma were further confirmed by Western blot analyses in an independent series of serum samples and/or pancreatic juice samples. Applying immunohistochemistry, we further validated expression of cyclin I and GDI2 in additional pancreatic carcinomas. These results indicate that cyclin I and GDI2 may be potential molecular targets for pancreatic cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) are characterized by a desmoplastic reaction involving activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). However, the mechanisms of PSC activation remain poorly understood. We examined whether the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process might play a role in PSC activation. PSCs were isolated from a rat pancreas and characterized using immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry. We evaluated changes in cell motility and in the expression levels of a panel of EMT-related genes during the PSC activation process. Activation of PSCs occurred after 48 h of in vitro culture, as indicated by a morphological change to a myofibroblastic shape and a decrease in the number of cytoplasmic lipid droplets. After activation, PSCs showed enhanced cell migration ability compared to quiescent cells. In addition, the expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, BMP7 and desmoplakin) decreased, while expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin1, collagen1\u03b11 and S100A4) increased in activated PSCs. EMT-related transcription factors (Snail and Slug) were also upregulated after PSC activation. The concurrent increase in cell migration ability and alterations in EMT-related gene expression suggests that the activation of PSCs involves an EMT-like process. The knowledge that PSC activation involves an EMT\u2011like process may help to identify potential new therapeutic targets to alleviate pancreatic fibrosis in diseases like CP and PDAC.",

        "abstract": "MUC4 mucin is well known as an important potential target to overcome pancreatic cancer. Three unique domains (NIDO, AMOP, and vWD) with unclear roles only present in MUC4 but are not found in other membrane-bound mucins. Our previous studies first reported that its splice variant, MUC4/Y can be a model of MUC4 (MUC4 gene fragment is more than 30KB, too huge to clone and eukaryotic express) in pancreatic cancer. More importantly, based on MUC4/Y with the appropriate length of gene sequence, it is easy to construct the unique domain-lacking models of MUC4/Y (MUC4) for research. The present study focuses on investigation of the respective role of the unique NIDO, AMOP, and vWD domain or their synergistic effect on MUC4(MUC4/Y)-mediated functions and mechanisms by series of in vitro assays, sequence-based transcriptome analysis, validation of qRT-PCR & Western blot, and systematic comparative analysis. Our results demonstrate: 1) NIDO, AMOP, and vWD domain or their synergy play significant roles on MUC4/Y-mediated malignant function of pancreatic cancer, downstream of molecule mechanisms, particularly MUC4/Y-triggered malignancy-related positive feedback loops, respectively. 2) The synergistic roles of three unique domains on MUC4/Y-mediated functions and mechanisms are more prominent than the respective domain because the synergy of three domain plays the more remarkable effects on MUC4/Y-mediated signaling hub. Thus, to improve reversed effects of domain-lacking and break the synergism of domains will contribute to block MUC4/Y(MUC4) triggering various oncogenic signaling pathways.",

Gene expression data were generated from normal organ samples and pancreatic cancer samples from three public databases. STK31 expression patterns in normal and PC tissues were identified, and we explored its regulatory mechanisms. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analyses of STK31-related genes were performed and an STK31 protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. STK31 was confirmed as a CT gene in PC and its expression was significantly higher in patients with new neoplasm compared with patients without new neoplasm (P = 0.046) and in more advanced pathologic stages than in earlier stages (P = 0.002); methylation level correlated negatively with STK31 expression. In total, 757 STK31-related genes were identified, and were significantly enriched in terms of polymorphisms and alternative splicings. The PPI network predicted that STK31 was physically associated with the PIWI (originally P-element Induced WImpy testis in Drosophila) and Tudor families.",

However, the risk factors of this complication in patients after DP still remain controversial. The aim of our study is to estimate the association between potential risk factors and POPF. Relevant articles published up to June 21, 2016 were identified via PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library. Studies that examined the risk factors of POPF following DP were enrolled. 20 articles (2070 patients) were finally included in this study. The pooled data suggested that patients with soft pancreas, higher Body Mass Index (BMI), blood transfusion, elevated intraoperative blood loss, and longer operative time had a decreased risk for POPF. However, age, gender, malignant pathology, types of stump closure, octreotide therapy, history of diabetes and chronic pancreatitis, splenectomy, multiorgan resection, main duct ligation, preoperative serum albumin levels, PGA felt wrapping, and extended lymphadenectomy could not be regarded as risk factors for POPF. Our analytic data demonstrated that pancreas texture, BMI, blood transfusion, intraoperative blood loss, and operative time were clinical predictor for POPF. This study may assist surgeons to screen patients with high risk of POPF and select appropriate treatment measures.",

The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of MUC4 gene expression are not fully understood. In this report, we used pancreatic cancer cell line (Bxpc-3) to explore the potential transcription factors regulating MUC4 transcriptional activity. Through promoter screening, overexpressing methods and luciferase reporter studies, we found that transcription factors CREB, Ets-1, Elk-1 and STAT1 can positively regulate MUC4 expression at the promoter and mRNA level. Our findings will be helpful for better understanding the transcriptional regulation of MUC4 in pancreatic cancer cells and identifying key biologically relevant factors that may account for its aberrant expression in pancreatic cancer.",

        "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications play an important role in multistage carcinogenesis. The role of the three functional DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in pancreatic carcinogenesis has not been fully understood. The main goal of this study was to examine DNMT expression in different stages of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and evaluate their prognostic significance in PDAC.A large number of premalignant and malignant pancreatic lesions were obtained by manual microdissection. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to detect DNMTs mRNA expression. Nonparametric test, logrank test and Cox regression analysis were used to evaluate the clinical significance of DNMT expression.The mRNA expression of the three DNMTs increased with the development of pancreatic cancer from normal duct to pancreatic intraductal neoplasia and further to PDAC, and were statistically correlated with each other. Expression of the three DNMTs was statistically correlated with TNM staging and history of chronic pancreatitis. DNMT3A and DNMT3B, but not DNMT1 expression, was statistically correlated with tumour size. Patients with higher levels of DNMT1, DNMT3A and/or DNMT3B expression had an overall lower survival than those with lower levels of expression. Univariate analysis showed that high expression levels of DNMTs, alcohol consumption, tumour differentiation and TNM staging were statistically significant risk factors. Multivariate analysis showed that high level of DNMT3B expression and tumour differentiation were statistically significant independent poor prognostic factors.These results suggested that pancreatic carcinogenesis involves an increased mRNA expression of three DNMTs, and they may become valuable diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as potential therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.",

        "abstract": "The human mucin 4 (MUC4) is aberrantly expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and tumor cell lines, while remaining undetectable in normal pancreas, indicating its important role in pancreatic cancer development. Although its transcriptional regulation has been investigated in considerable detail, some important elements remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the existence of a novel inhibitory element in the MUC4 promoter and characterize some of its binding proteins. By luciferase reporter assay, we located the inhibitory element between nucleotides -2530 and -2521 in the MUC4 promoter using a series of deletion and mutant reporter constructs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with Bxpc-3 cell nuclear extracts revealed that one protein or protein complex bind to this element. The proteins binding to this element were purified and identified as Yin Yang 1 (YY1) by mass spectrometry. Supershift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay confirmed that YY1 binds to this element in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, transient YY1 overexpression significantly inhibited MUC4 promoter activity and endogenous MUC4 protein expression. In conclusion, we reported here a novel inhibitory element in the human MUC4 promoter. This provides additional data on MUC4 gene regulation and indicates that YY1 may be a potential target for abnormal MUC4 expression.",

Natural killer (NK) cell dysfunction may be responsible for this phenomenon, however, the exact relationship between tumor immunosurveillance escape in digestive malignancies and NK cell dysfunction remains unclear.Percentage of the surface receptors NKG2A, KIR3DL1, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, and DNAM-1, as well as the cytotoxic granules perforin and granzyme B positive NK cells were determined in patients with pancreatic cancer (n=31), gastric cancer (n=31), and CRC (n=32) prior to surgery and healthy controls (n=31) by multicolor flow cytometry. Independent t-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to compare the differences between the patient and healthy control groups, as well as the differences between patients with different pathologic features of cancer.Percentage of NKG2D, NKp30, NKp46, and perforin positive NK cells was significantly down-regulated in patients with PC compared to healthy controls, as well as GC and CRC; reduced levels of these molecules was associated with indicators of disease progression in each malignancy (such as histological grade, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis). On the contrary, percentage of KIR3DL1 positive NK cells was significantly increased in patients with PC, as well as GC and CRC, but was not associated with any indicators of disease progression.Altered percentage of surface receptors and cytotoxic granules positive NK cells may play a vital role in tumor immunosurveillance escape by inducing NK cell dysfunction in patients with PC, GC, and CRC.",

        "abstract": "Expression of the transmembrane-4-L-six-family-1 (TM4SF1) is high in human pancreatic cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize microRNAs that regulate TM4SF1 expression in PC cells. Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect TM4SF1 and hsa-miR-141 levels in four PC cell lines. SW1990 and BxPc-3 cells were transfected with the inhibitor miR-141, the inhibitor negative control, the miR-141 mimic and the mimic negative control; and cell invasion, migration, proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis were detected by Transwell, MTT and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The miR-141 levels negatively correlated with the TM4SF1 protein levels in PC cells. The TM4SF1 protein levels were lower in the 141M group but higher in the 141I group, although the TM4SF1 mRNA levels had no significant changes, compared to the negative controls. Luciferase assays demonstrated that hsa-miR-141 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of the TM4SF1 gene. In addition, miR-141 downregulated TM4SF1 expression to inhibit invasion and migration of PC cells but had no effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle progression or apoptosis. TM4SF1 is a direct target of miR-141. Our findings that TM4SF1 expression was inhibited by miR-141 provide new insights into the oncogenic mechanism of TM4SF1 and suggest that miR-141 represents a novel molecular target for PC therapy.",

        "abstract": "Perineural invasion (PNI) is the neoplastic invasion of nerves by cancer cells, a process that has attracted attention as a novel prognostic factor for cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of PNI in patients with early-stage cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA2-IIA). A total of 210 patients who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy between 2007 and 2012 were included in the current study, of whom 8.57% (18/210) exhibited PNI. Patients with PNI were more likely to exhibit adverse histopathological features, such as increased tumor size, depth of stromal invasion, parametrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion and lymph nodes metastases (all P<0.05). Patients with PNI exhibited shorter disease-free and overall survival (P=0.002 and P=0.017, respectively). However, PNI was not identified as an independent risk factor for either recurrence or death by multivariate analysis. Furthermore, 88.9% (16/18) of patients with PNI received adjuvant therapy following surgery. PNI was significantly associated with well-established indicators for adjuvant therapy. In conclusion, PNI was associated with multiple high-risk factors and its presence was indicative of a poor outcome in patients with early-stage cervical cancer, which may influence management decisions regarding adjuvant therapy.",

Optical multicasting outperforms the electronic multicasting in some aspects. Service level agreement (SLA) and quality of service (QoS) are important to service providers and users. Service providers always first maximize revenue to accept as many as connection requests as possible and then to minimize the capacity of all accepted connection. In this paper, the problem of cost-effective optical multicasting connection provisioning to satisfy the connections' availability requirements on a given physical topology is formally stated. We propose a mixed integer linear program (MILP) based approach for static multicast traffic. The feature of our algorithm lies on without considering any protection schemes, and when the system adapts dedicated protection or the sharing protection, the problem is more complicated.",

In this paper, we investigated approaches and algorithms for establishing a multicast session with differentiated leaf availability requirements in WDM mesh network while protecting it against single link failure. An efficient and cost-effective heuristic is presented to solve the problem and is compared with two other schemes, one with no protection (Scheme I) and the other with dedicated protection (Scheme II). We also formulated a possible improvement of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results based on 14 node NSFNET topology and comparisons among these schemes are also discussed. The performance of an algorithm is measured in terms of Average Cost and Average Satisfaction Ratio. The improved algorithm shows much better performance than the other ones, thus achieving the goal of effectively establishing protected multicast sessions with differentiated destination availability requirements. Finally, through numerical simulation results, we find that some links are critical to the performance of the network. Increasing the availability and capacity of these links will greatly enhance the network performance. This result is helpful to network planning and design.",

The ring network for this architecture has been demonstrated experimentally. In slotted WDM ring network, each node is equipped with a wavelength-tunable transmitter and a fixed receiver and assigned with a specific wavelength. A node can send data to every other node by tuning wavelength accordingly in a time slot. One of the important issues for it is scheduling. Scheduling of it can be reduced to input queued switch when synchronization and propagation are solved and many schemes have been proposed to solve these two issues. However, it's proved that scheduling of such a network taking both jitter and throughput into consideration is NP hard. Greedy algorithm has been proposed to solve it before. The main contribution of this paper lies in a novel genetic algorithm to obtain optimal or near optimal value of this specific NP hard problem. We devise problem specific chromosome codes, fitness function, crossover and mutation operations. Experimental results show that our GA provides better performances in terms of throughput and jitter than a greedy heuristic.",

As a consequence, it is becoming a popular belief that induction of autophagy is a common response of cells upon exposure to nanoscale materials. In order to clarify whether the \"nanoscale\" size is the determining factor for the nanomaterials to induce autophagy, we utilized in vitro cultured cells and an in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model to systemically investigate the autophagy-inducing ability of nanomaterials. We selected four types of representative nanomaterials with similar sizes, namely silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs), CdTe quantum dots (QDs), carbon dots (CDs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). We demonstrated that, unlike most other nanomaterials tested, no autophagosome formation was detected in cultured cells or in live C. elegans with SiNP treatment. The expression of autophagy-related genes and the lipidation of LGG-1/LC3 in cells and C. elegans also remained unchanged after the treatment of SiNPs. In addition, the ability of the nanomaterials to induce autophagy appeared to correlate with those to incur subcellular organelle damage. Together, our studies demonstrate that SiNPs do not induce autophagy in vitro or in vivo in the selected model organisms and cell lines, thus clarifying that the \"nanoscale\" size is not the determining factor for the nanomaterials to induce autophagy. The results also suggest that the autophagy-inducing ability of most nanomaterials could be merely a reflection of their detrimental effect on cellular structures.",

        "abstract": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are inevitably released into the aquatic environment for being widely used and may affect the toxicity of other contaminants already present in the environment, such as trace metals. However, the effects of NPs on the ecotoxicity of cadmium (Cd), a common environmental trace metal pollutant, are not well explored. In this study, effects of four widely used NPs TiO (n-TiO), SiO (n-SiO), Ag (n-Ag) and CdTe/CdS core/shell quantum dots (QD) on the toxicity of Cd to the freshwater algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were assessed respectively. Cd reduced the algae biomass, impaired the photosynthetic activities, and led to intracellular oxidative stress of algae. At non-toxic concentrations, both n-TiO (100\u202fmg\u202fL) and n-SiO (400\u202fmg\u202fL) attenuated the toxicity of Cd towards the algae for reducing the intracellular Cd contents, and the former was more pronounced. QD (0.5\u202fmg\u202fL) increased the toxicity of Cd to algae, but n-Ag (0.2\u202fmg\u202fL) had no significant influence on the Cd toxicity to algae. The microscopic observations on the ultrastructure of algae cells presented the same phenomena and n-TiO, n-SiO aggregations were clearly observed outside the cell wall. Furthermore, the regulation of NPs to the Cd toxicity towards algae was related to the intracellular nitric oxide (NO), an important signaling molecule, rather than the phototaxis of algae. Above all, this study provided a basic understanding about the difference in joint toxicity of different kinds of NPs and Cd to aquatic organisms.",

        "abstract": "Considering that heavy metal pollution problem is widespread in the soil of South China, bioleaching process and bioleaching combined with Fenton-like reaction were used to study the removal performance of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in the contaminated soil around the lead-zinc mine in ShaoGuan City, Guangdong Province, China. Sequential chemical extraction was applied to analyze the effects of different treatments on the fracion distributions of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. The results showed that 66.5% of copper,55.1% of zinc, 72.8% of cadmium and 35.6% of lead could be removed after 12-day bioleaching process, among which, the inorganic bound-fracion had the best dissolution efficiency. The rest of the heavy metals in solid phase mainly existed in the form of stabilized residual fraction. With an optimal HO concentration of 5 g\u00b7L, the removal efficiencies of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb were 55.6%, 50.6%, 60.7% and 30.5% respectively after 2-day bioleaching combined with Fenton-like reaction, which indicated that this treatment was less effective than 12-day bioleaching, but significantly more effective than the HSO leaching, 2-day bioleaching, and Fenton reaction. The bioleaching combined with Fenton-like reaction could realize the effective dissolution of stable-state heavy metals such as residual fraction, organic bound fraction and inorganic bound fraction in the soil, the contents of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb were below the limit value of standand of 50, 200, 0.3 and 250 mg\u00b7kg after the treatment, respectively. It possesses the advantage of high removal efficiency in bioleaching and rapid reaction rate in Fenton reaction, thus, it is a promising remediation treatment for heavy metal contaminated soil.",

        "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a nonessential and toxic trace element widely existing in waters through various anthropogenic activities such as mining and waste disposal. The physiological responses of aquatic organisms to long-term Cd exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations are still not well explored. In the present study, two strains of unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a walled strain CC125 and a wall-less strain CC406 were selected to investigate the physiological changes of aquatic organisms after long-term Cd exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations (4.92 and 49.2 \u03bcg L-1). After about 1000 generations of selection, all of the two strains showed higher intracellular lipid peroxidation and lower photosynthetic activities, and failed to evolve specific adaptation to high levels of Cd (4.92 mg L-1) compared to the control. However, short-term low dose Cd exposure exerted hormetic effects on C. reinhardtii and the hormetic stimulation of growth rate, chlorophyll contents and photochemical activities at the lower concentration of Cd (4.92 \u03bcg L-1) groups were more pronounced than those at higher ones (49.2 \u03bcg L-1). Taken together, this study confirmed that long-term exposure to Cd at environmentally relevant concentrations which were regarded as nontoxic in acute experiments would produce toxic effects on C. reinhardtii and should be paid more attention.",

        "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a common hazardous pollutant to aquatic environments and it easily accumulates in living organisms. The roles of phototactic behavior in Cd tolerance in motile organisms are poorly explored. In this study, two Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains, a wild type with positive phototaxis (CC125) and a negatively phototactic mutant (agg1), were used to assess the effects of phototaxis on Cd-induced toxicity to algae. Exposure to Cd inhibited the cell growth and photosynthetic activities, reduced the photosynthetic pigment content, and enhanced the intracellular oxidative stress of algae. Well buffered by EDTA in algae medium, the concentrations of Cd causing 50% growth inhibition (EC50) of CC125 and agg1 for 72\u00a0h of exposure were 55.96 and 77.20 \u03bcM L-1, respectively. Photosystem II activities in CC125 were more sensitive to Cd than agg1 at 60 \u03bcM L-1 Cd. In addition, agg1 accumulated less intracellular Cd than CC125. The changes of extracellular polymeric substances and intracellular response to Cd stress might be related to the different tolerances of the two algae to Cd. Taken together, phototaxis was demonstrated to be associated with Cd-induced toxicity to C. reinhardtii.",

In this paper, we present some nonzero lower bounds for the free energy, the entropy production rate, and its adiabatic and non-adiabatic parts. These nonzero lower bounds not only reveal some novel dissipative properties for nonequilibrium dynamics which are much stronger than the second law of thermodynamics, but also impose some new constraints on thermodynamic constitutive relations. Moreover, we also give a mathematical application of the nonzero lower bounds by studying the long-time behavior of the master equation. Extensions to the Tsallis statistics are also discussed, including the nonzero lower bounds for the Tsallis-type free energy and its dissipation rate.",

This formalism extends the classical irreversible thermodynamics which leads to classical thermodynamics and can not describe physical phenomena with long relaxations. With the extended theory, we obtain a generalized hydrodynamic system which can be used to describe the non-Newtonian fluids, heat transfer beyond Fourieru0027s law and fluid flow in very short temporal and spatial scales. We study the mathematical structure of the generalized hydrodynamic system and show that it possesses a nice conservation-dissipation structure and therefore is symmetrizable hyperbolic. Moreover, we rigorously justify that this generalized hydrodynamic system tends to the classical hydrodynamics when the relaxation times approach to zero. This shows that the classical hydrodynamics can be derived as an approximation of our generalized one.",

The tribology performance of selective laser melting processed parts is critically important for industrial applications but related studies are rare. In this study, friction and wear behaviors of 316\u00a0L stainless steel processed both by selective laser melting and traditional methods have been investigated using a ring-on-disc rig under lubricated conditions. The selective laser melting processed sample had molten pools, pores and fine grains in the microstructure, unlike the traditionally processed sample. The selective laser melting processed sample had slightly lower friction and wear than the traditionally processed sample when in contact with brass. When the selective laser melting and traditionally processed samples came in contact with a hard material, the differences in friction and wear were noticeable. The wear mechanism of the selective laser melting processed sample under the given contact condition has been proposed. Pores and refined grains in the selective laser melting processed 316\u00a0L stainless steel affected the friction and wear differently; consequently, both factors needs to be considered together.",

This study focuses on the influence of surface topography on the cavitation erosion rate of AlSi10Mg using an ASTM G134 test rig. Polishing, grinding, turning, and laser texturing are employed to finish the surfaces. The obtained cavitation erosion rates are presented, and the surface topography, cross-section, and surface parameters are analyzed. The results indicate that the laser textured surface demonstrates a higher cavitation erosion rate than other surfaces. Certain patterns on the surface affect the deforming behaviors at the acceleration period of cavitation erosion progresses. 3D surface parameters,  S   sk   and  S   ku  , can be employed for predicting the time required for removing the original surface finishing marks.",

Selective laser melting (SLM), is a type of additive manufacturing that can produce metal parts directly and it has begun to be used in various industrial settings. However, the erosion properties of the SLM processed parts have only rarely been reported. The paper addresses the cavitation erosion behavior of AlSi10Mg samples fabricated by SLM at different laser scanning speeds. A wrought sample was also tested to provide a basis for comparison. Sample hardness and microstructure were investigated. Results showed the cavitation erosion behaviors of SLM samples to differ greatly from that of the wrought sample. The erosion rate of SLM samples was found to peak in the first 30 s. This was accompanied by the removal of particles inside pores. After peaking, the erosion rate of the SLM samples decreased significantly. SLM samples showed an extremely low erosion rate entering the steady-state period. Large, deep craters which were common wear marks on the wrought sample, were not present on the SLM samples. Different scanning speeds resulted in different max erosion rates.",

        "abstract": "Selective laser melting (SLM) is one type of additive manufacturing which produces metal parts by powder bed fusion. Since the materials undergo repeated and sharp heating/cooling cycles, the SLMed parts have unique microstructures. The relations among SLM processing parameters, resultant microstructures, and mechanical properties have been investigated by many researchers. However, the wear performance of SLMed materials under various contact conditions has not been carried out until recently. This paper is a presentation of previous and recent research related to wear performance. This is a crucial aspect if SLM is to be expanded to produce friction pairs. Wear rates and mechanisms of the SLMed materials under dry, boundary lubrication, cavitation erosion, and corrosion conditions are discussed and compared with conventionally processed (CP) materials. SLMed materials benefit from fine grains and high hardness, which have higher wear resistance than CP materials. Moreover, a unique tribo-layer on the surface of the SLMed part is found to protect the bulk material under boundary lubrication conditions. An optimized combination of processing parameters increases part density, which further improves the wear resistance. Future work includes studying the influence of pores on the deforming and lubricating behaviors from dry conditions to different lubrication regimes. The final target is to actively control the processing parameters to obtain desirable material properties for improving wear performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As one type of additive manufacturing technology, selective laser melting (SLM) can produce complex metal parts through a layer-to-layer construction technique. During this process, pores \u2014often viewed as defects\u2014 are generated on the surface and within the printed part. Pores are known to affect its structural integrity, functionality, and overall performance. Thus, many studies have focused on the development of methodologies to reduce pores in order to increase density and the component\u2019s strength. However, the extent to which pores affect the tribological performance under lubricated conditions has not been studied. In this research, porous samples were fabricated using different SLM laser exposure times. The density, hardness, and microstructures of the SLMed samples were studied and compared to a conventionally manufactured part. Pin-on-disk tests were performed to investigate friction and wear performances of three types of the SLMed samples under mixed to hydrodynamic lubrication regimes. Results showed that SLMed samples had fine grains that were much smaller than the conventionally manufactured samples. With the increased laser exposure time, the size of cellular structures in the SLMed samples increased. The number of pores decreases with increased laser exposure times while part density increases. The rest results revealed that the porous SLM samples yielded lower coefficients of friction compared to a near fully densified SLM sample due to the improved lubrication caused by pores. Pores became smaller or even closed up as a result of plastic deformation. Effective porosity, which measures pores inside the contact area, was used to evaluate the influence of pores of SLMed samples on lubrication.",

Macular degeneration in BVMD can begin in childhood or adulthood. The variation in the age of onset is not clearly understood. The present study characterized the clinical characteristics of two Chinese patients with either juvenile\u2011onset BVMD or adult\u2011onset BVMD and investigated the underlying genetic variations. A 16\u2011year\u2011old male (Patient 1) was diagnosed with juvenile\u2011onset BVMD and a 43\u2011year\u2011old female (Patient 2) was diagnosed with adult\u2011onset BVMD. Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations were performed, including best\u2011corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit\u2011lamp examination, fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, fundus fluorescein angiography imaging and Espion electrophysiology. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes collected from these patients, their family members, and 200 unrelated subjects within in the same population. The 11 exons of the bestrophin\u20111 (BEST1) gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and directly sequenced. Both patients presented lesions in the macular area. In Patient 1, a heterozygous mutation c.903T>G (p.D301E) in exon 8 of the BEST1 gene was identified. This mutation was not present in any of the unaffected family members or the normal controls. Polymorphism phenotyping and the sorting intolerant from tolerant algorithm predicted that the amino acid substitution D301E in bestrophin\u20111 protein was damaging. In Patient 2, a single nucleotide polymorphism c.1608C>T (p.T536T) in exon 10 of the BEST1 gene was identified. These findings expand the spectrum of BEST1 genetic variation and will be valuable for genetic counseling and the development of therapeutic interventions for patients with BVMD.",

A total of two Chinese patients diagnosed with Crouzon syndrome underwent complete examinations, including best\u2011corrected visual acuity, slit\u2011lamp, examination, fundus examination, optical coherence tomography and computed tomography of the skull. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples collected from the patients, as well as their family members and 200 unrelated control subjects from the same population. Exons\u00a08 and\u00a010 in the FGFR2 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and directly sequenced. Patient #1 had a heterozygous missense mutation (c.1025G>A, p.C342Y) in exon 10 of FGFR2. Patient #2 had a heterozygous mutation (c.1084+1 G>T; IVS10+1G>T) in intron 10. The mutations were not present in any of the unaffected family members or unrelated control subjects. These findings expand the mutation spectrum of FGFR2, and are valuable for genetic counseling in addition to prenatal diagnosis in patients with Crouzon syndrome.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic changes in two Chinese patients with Stickler syndrome, manifested as bilateral retinal detachment and peripheral retinal degeneration. Complete ophthalmic examinations, including best\u2011corrected visual acuity, slit\u2011lamp examination and fundus examination, were performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of the peripheral blood collected from the patients, their unaffected family members and 200 unrelated control subjects from the same population. Next\u2011generation sequencing of established genes associated with ocular disease was performed. A heterozygous collagen type\u00a0II \u03b11\u00a0chain (COL2A1) mutation c.1310G>C (p.R437P) in exon\u00a021 was identified in Family\u00a01 and a heterozygous COL2A1 mutation c.2302\u20111G>A in intron 34 was identified in Family\u00a02. The functional effects of the mutations were assessed by polymorphism phenotyping (PolyPhen) and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) analysis. The c.1310G>C mutation was predicted to damage protein structure and function, and the c.2302\u20111G>A mutation was predicted to result in a splicing defect. The findings of the current study expand the established mutation spectrum of COL2A1, and may facilitate genetic counseling and development of therapeutic strategies for patients with Stickler syndrome.",

It is frequently associated with keratopathy, cataract, juvenile\u2011onset glaucoma and foveal and optic nerve hypoplasia. Mutations in the Paired Box 6 (PAX6) gene on chromosome 11p13 have been demonstrated to cause aniridia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic variations of PAX6 in two sporadic patients from southern China with classic congenital aniridia and cataract. Complete ophthalmic and physical examinations were performed, including best\u2011corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit\u2011lamp examination, fundus examination, optical coherence tomography, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and Pentacam scanning. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood collected from the two patients, their unaffected parents and 200 unrelated control subjects from the same population. Exons 4\u201113 of the PAX6 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced directly. Patient 1 was affected with aniridia accompanied by congenital cataract and nystagmus. A novel heterozygous PAX6 frameshift mutation c.277delG (p.Glu93SerfsX31) in exon 6 was identified in this patient. Patient 2 was presented with aniridia, congenital cataract, lens subluxation and glaucoma. A recurrent nonsense mutation c.718C>T (p.Arg240X) in exon 9 was identified in this patient. The present results expand the mutation spectrum of PAX6 and will be valuable for genetic counseling in the affected families. Additionally, the identification of these mutations reiterates the importance of PAX6 in ocular development and sheds light on the pathogenesis of congenital aniridia.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A high sensitivity surface plasmon resonance (SPR) fiber sensor with graphene coated silver nano-columns on the surface of the D-type single mode fiber has been proposed and simulated in this paper. The sensor uses evanescent wave on the surface of the fiber to excite free electrons on the metal surface to generate surface plasmon waves (SPW), and the change of refractive index (RI) is measured by monitoring the variation of the resonance absorption peak. The COMSOL Multiphysics software is used to optimize the diameter of sliver nano-column, the width of air gap between sliver columns, and to study the effect of graphene sensing layer thickness on sensor sensitivity. The simulation results show that the sensitivity of the sensor can be greatly improved with graphene coated sliver nano-columns. The maximum external RI response sensitivity of the sensor proposed in this paper can reach 8860.93\u202fnm/RIU in the RI range of 1.33\u20131.39 when the diameter of silver nano-column is 90\u202fnm, the graphene is 23 layers and the width of air gap between columns is 53.82\u202fnm. When the RI is 1.39, the sensitivity of the sensor with 23 layers of graphene can be increased by 28% compared with the sensor without the graphene layer. The simulation results will be helpful for design and fabrication of optical fiber SPR refractive index sensor.",

The strong sensing capability of the sensor to detect the concentration of ethanol vapor is demonstrated, taking advantage of the evanescent field enhancement and gas absorption of a graphene-oxide-coated microfiber. The transmission spectrum of the sensor varies with concentrations of ethanol vapor, and the redshift of the transmission spectrum has been analyzed for the concentration range from 0 to 80\u00a0ppm with sensitivity as high as 0.138\u00a0nm/ppm. The coated graphene oxide layer induces the evanescent field enhancement and gas selective adsorption, which improves sensitivity and selectivity of the microfiber gas sensor for ethanol vapor detection.",

The sensor is fabricated by coating the tapered microfiber interferometer (MFI) with zinc oxide nanoparticle incorporated graphene oxide (GO-ZnO). GO-ZnO nanocomposites serving as an electron acceptor trap electrons after ammonia absorption and then change the surface refractive index of the optical microfiber in MFI. Subsequently, the MFI translates the tiny refractive index change into wavelength shift of the transmission spectra. As prepared sensor exhibits a good repeatability and high sensitivity to ammonia with different connections from 4\u00a0ppm to 140\u00a0ppm at room temperature. The gas sensor response to ammonia has been studied in different moisture level and show reliable operation in low humidity atmosphere. In addition, the gas sensor also displays an excellent selectivity to ammonia compared to several possible interfering volatile organic compounds. This may be attributed to the selective ammonia absorption at the GO-ZnO surface and the additional synergistic effects of GO-ZnO nanocomposites that are desirable and advantageous for gas sensing.",

        "abstract": "The coefficient of friction between railway wheels and rails is crucial to railway operation and maintenance. Since the wheel\u2013rail system is an open system, environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, affect the friction coefficient. Pin-on-disc testing was conducted to study the influence of environmental conditions and iron oxides on the coefficient of friction between the wheel and rail. The iron oxides were pre-created in a climate chamber. The surfaces of the tested samples were analysed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron/focused ion beam microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Results indicate that the coefficient of friction decreases with increasing relative humidity (RH) up to a saturation level. Above this level, the coefficient of friction remains low and stable even when the RH increases. In particular, when the temperature is low, a small increase in the amount of water (i.e., absolute humidity) in the air can significantly reduce the coefficient of friction. At high humidity levels, a water molecule film can keep the generated haematite on the surfaces, counterbalancing the effect of rising humidity.",

These complexes have been characterized with UV-vis, IR, 1H NMR, ESI mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and X-ray single-crystal diffraction techniques. The influence of the rod length and substituents on properties of these complexes has been investigated. In addition, the self-assembly of these nanorods has also been explored. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

Their structures have been characterized by IR, UV-vis, (1)H NMR, ESI-MS, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Hydrogen bonding interactions play an important role in the supramolecular assemblies of these compounds in the solid state. Although the incorporated organic ligands are similar to each other, their supramolecular assembly behaviors are quite different. For compound 1, the dimer structure is formed via hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl group and the POM cluster of two neighboring cluster anions. For compound 2, the 1D chain structure is formed via hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl groups and the POM clusters of the cluster anions. For compound 3, the 2D plane structure is formed via two types of hydrogen bonding between the aromatic rings and the POM clusters of the cluster anions. For compound 4, the 1D plus 2D structures are formed via three types of hydrogen bonding between the aromatic rings and the POM clusters of the two types of cluster anions with different orientations.",

        "title": "Dasatinib synergises with irinotecan to suppress hepatocellular carcinoma via inhibiting the protein synthesis of PLK1",
        "abstract": "As one of the most common cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second cause of death by cancer and the overall median survival for HCC patients is <6 months currently (95% CI: 5.9\u20136.1; Njei et al, 2015; Torre et al, 2015). Owing to the difficulty in accurate and reliable diagnosis of early-stage HCC, most patients are confirmed as advanced stage (Bruix et al, 2011). For advanced HCC, the only first-line drug is sorafenib, which unfortunately has a limited effect on HCC. Therefore, a novel and effective clinical treatment strategy for HCC is urgently needed (Bupathi et al, 2015). Irinotecan, a kind of DNA Topoisomerase-I inhibitor, has been widely used as a first-line chemotherapy in some solid malignant tumours, such as colon cancer (Ottolino-Perry et al, 2015). Numerous studies (Takeba et al, 2007) showed that SN38 (the in vivo active metabolite of irinotecan) had superior inhibition ability against HCC in vitro, whereas the phase II studies of irinotecan on HCC failed owing to its dose-dependent toxicity (O'Reilly et al, 2001). Consequently, a combination therapy with lower dose to decrease the toxicity of irinotecan will be a potential strategy for its application on HCC. Dasatinib is a kind of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeted on Abl, c-kit and Src (Montero et al, 2011) and has been used to treat patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukaemia (Talpaz et al, 2006)and several kinds of solid tumours (Mayer et al, 2011). It has been reported that dasatinib combined with traditional chemotherapeutic agents could reveal additional antitumour effect (Milano et al, 2009; Secord et al, 2012; Somlo et al, 2013; Viktorsson et al, 2016). The approaches in which dasatinib shows these effects are various. One of the mechanisms is decreasing protein biosynthesis through the modulation of target genes (Nunoda et al, 2007). As is well known, the overexpression caused by increased protein biosynthesis is one of the ways in which oncogenes are activated. In other words, the reduction of synthesis is a possible method to inhibit oncogenes. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a well-studied regulator in mitosis and has key role in numerous mitotic events (Barr et al, 2004). It also directly takes part in DNA integrity maintenance and regulation of DNA repair according to accumulating evidence (Chabalier-Taste et al, 2016). Of note, PLK1 is overexpressed in HCC (He et al, 2009) and has been proven to be one of the factors that could determine SN38 sensitivity of tumour cells (Zuco et al, 2015). These facts indicate that the inhibition of PLK1 protein biosynthesis progress may confront the overexpression of PLK1 and consequently enhance the effect of SN38 on HCC. Here we hypothesised that dasatinib could interfere with PLK1 synthesis and show synergistic antitumour effect with SN38. In this study, we confirmed that the combination of irinotecan and dasatinib has synergistic antitumour effect on HCC and exhibited that the synergistic effect was a result of inhibition of PLK1 through the downregulation of its synthesis and consequently induced increasing apoptosis of cancer cells. Therefore, the combination use of irinotecan and dasatinib might be an effective strategy for clinical therapy of HCC. Crystal violet was dissolved in 10% acetic acid and the absorbance values were determined at 595\u2009nm. The clonogenic ability was calculated as ((the absorbance of treated cells\u2212the absorbance of blank)/(the absorbance of control cells\u2212the absorbance of blank)) \u00d7 100%. To explore whether the combination treatment of SN38 and dasatinib can induce a long-term synergistic antitumour effect, we performed a clonogenic assay. HepG-2 and BEL-7402 cells were respectively treated with monotherapy or co-treatment for 24\u2009h, and then cells in each group were normally cultured for clone formation at the same count. The typical pictures after 20-day culture are shown in Figure 1D, in which combination treatment resulted in a significant inhibition to the proliferation of HepG-2 and BEL-7402 cell clone while the monotreatment induced a moderate inhibition. Simultaneously, we calculated the rates of colony formation compared with the control group. Consistent with the picture, the HepG-2 colony-formation rates treated by dasatinib, SN38 and combination were 71.2\u00b110.3%, 57.9\u00b16.6% and 11.1\u00b11.7%, respectively. And the BEL-7402 colony-formation rates treated by dasatinib, SN38 and combination were 82.0\u00b18.1%, 73.4\u00b115.7% and 23.4\u00b12.1%, respectively (Figure 1E), indicating that the combination treatment performed a long-term synergistic effect on the survival and proliferation of HCC cells. Taken together, combination of dasatinib and SN38 showed reinforced antitumour effect on human HCC cell lines in vitro. As caspase-dependent pathway is an important pathway involved in cell apoptosis, we monitored the activation of the caspase cascade in HCC cells after the treatment with dasatinib and/or SN38 by western blotting analysis. It is known that cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 represent occurrence of apoptosis (Jin and El-Deiry, 2005). We found that dasatinib or SN38 were able to increase the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 slightly, and these effect can be remarkably enhanced when applied together, which indicated that apoptosis was triggered by caspase cascades (Figure 2D). In sum, the above results proved that the combination use of dasatinib and SN38 led to increased apoptosis through caspase cascades in HCC cells, which finally caused more cell death. In addition, Bcl-2 family had an important role in regulating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (Martinou and Youle, 2011). Bcl-2 was known to be an antiapoptotic protein and Bax was recognised as a pro-apoptotic protein (Brunelle and Letai, 2009). Inactivation of Bcl-2 and activation of Bax were obviously detected in HCC cells treated with both dasatinib and SN38 (Figure 3C), and it was demonstrated that Bcl-2 family were able to activate downstream apoptosis pathways, such as caspase activation, apoptosis and cell death (Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004), which was consistent with our previous results. These data implicated that the combination therapy of dasatinib and SN38 induced mitochondrial related-apoptosis. For validation of PLK1\u2019s role, we detected the relation between the inhibition rate of PLK1 and apoptosis in HepG-2 cells. As shown in Figure 4C, along with the downregulation of PLK1 by siRNA, cleaved PARP was increased obviously. And after we used different concentrations of PLK1 siRNAs to downregulate PLK1, as can be seen in Figure 4D, with more inhibition of PLK1, upraised cleaved PARP was detected by western blotting. Furthermore, when we silenced PLK1 in HepG-2 cells, the cleaved PARP level was further arisen (Figure 4E), and when PLK1 was overexpressed, the SN-38-induced cleaved PARP level was recovered (Figure 4F). These data implicated that PLK1 had a part in the limitation of SN38 and thoroughly downregulation of PLK1 might be a way to reinforce the efficacy of SN38 on HepG-2 cells. To further study how dasatinib enhanced PLK1 inhibition, we incubated HepG-2 cells with lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine (CQ, 10\u2009\u03bcM) and proteasome inhibitor MG132 (2\u2009\u03bcM) before combination treatment of SN38 (20\u2009nM) and dasatinib (80\u2009nM). Both CQ and MG132 had no effect on combination treatment-induced suppression of PLK1, which denoted that degradation pathways were not involved in this combination therapy-induced PLK1 decrease (Figure 5E). Notably, the level of p-4EBP1 was observed to be reduced by combination treatment (Figure 5B), which implicated that the enhanced reduction of PLK1 might be a result of protein synthesis inhibition. For validation, CHX, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, was applied to prevent synthesis of PLK1 in HepG-2 cells as previously described (Liu et al, 2014). We determined that combination treatment was unable to further reduce the level of PLK1 after CHX pretreatment, as shown in Figure 5F. In sum, the combination treatment of SN38 and dasatinib shows anti-HCC effect chiefly through downregulating PLK1 protein levels in the way of inhibiting protein synthesis. In order to determine whether the synergistic antitumour effect was conducted by decreasing PLK1 and increasing tumour apoptosis in vivo, we detected the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and PLK1 in tumour tissues from xenograft mice. Consistent with our previous in vitro results, in vivo data showed that the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 increased greatly in the combination treatment group, implying the activation of caspase cascades. Besides, the inhibition of PLK1 caused by irinotecan was reinforced by dasatinib (Figure 6D). In sum, these results demonstrated that dasatinib induced inhibition of PLK1 and enhanced the efficacy of irinotecan/SN38 in vivo, which consequently reduced the dose of SN38 to a relatively safe level in xenograft model. HCC has a long history, and despite all the medical efforts, it still remains essentially incurable especially for advanced cases (Schutte et al, 2014; Tejeda-Maldonado et al, 2015). One of the most important reasons of this unfavourable situation is the lack of efficient anti-HCC agents. In this work, we demonstrated that combination treatment of dasatinib and irinotecan/SN38 led to augmented antitumour effect on HCC both in vitro and in vivo. This effect relies on the inhibition of PLK1, which is enhanced by dasatinib through its effect on the protein synthesis progress. PLK1 is a member of a serine/threonine kinases (PLK1\u20134) family and highly associated with G2 checkpoint (Lens et al, 2010; Liang et al, 2014) and is widely believed to have an important role in cell proliferation (Raab et al, 2015). The function of PLK1 could be related to various behaviours of tumour cells (Strebhardt and Ullrich, 2006) and thus the overexpression of PLK1 in HCC is often related to poor prognosis (He et al, 2009). Based on the importance of PLK1, it is supposed to be a desirable target. In fact, PLK1 has proved to strongly influence SN38 sensitivity of tumour cells (Zuco et al, 2015). Our data showed that SN38 did decrease the level of PLK1 in HCC cells but not thoroughly. The decrease was dependent on the concentration of SN38, which means if PLK1 could be inhibited by other methods, the concentration of SN38 could be lower to show effect. This might be a way to deal with the dose-dependent toxicity of irinotecan, which limits its effect on HCC. Dasatinib is a relatively well-studied antitumour agent. Its targets include a number of different molecules and pathways. PLK1 is not one of them, according to current perception. In fact, the relationship of PLK1 and dasatinib is almost unreported. However, the mechanism by which dasatinib influences certain downstream molecules remains heuristic. The way dasatinib acts on receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-kit and PDGFR is to block their kinase activity (Karaman et al, 2008). Except decreasing activity, dasatinib can also downregulate the amount of some targets \u2013 often downstream proteins. Dasatinib is proved to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in some kinds of tumour cells (Johnson et al, 2005) through the regulation of effectors molecules, such as p21, cyclin D1, CDK2 and CDK8. Among these, CDK2 and CDK8 are reported to be suppressed through gene modulation (Nunoda et al, 2007). Which indicates that dasatinib is able to inhibit targets by downregulating their synthesis level, which is determined by gene expression. According to the pattern in which dasatinib acts on CDK2 and CDK8 and the role of PLK1 in the antitumour effect of SN38, whether dasatinib could influence PLK1 by interfering with its synthesis is worth considering. This was confirmed by our data which showed that dasatinib could enhance the PLK1 inhibition of SN38 due to the blockage of protein synthesis. It is the first time that dasatinib is proved to have influence on PLK1. We also ruled out the possibility of dasatinib inhibiting PLK1 through protein degradation progress. The exact mechanism is likely to be a new direction of further study. Of note, it is highly possible that the way in which dasatinib inhibits PLK1 differs from those of existing PLK1 inhibitors. Currently, there are a number of PLK1 inhibitors undergoing clinical trials such as Volasertib (Van den Bossche et al, 2016) and Rigosertib (Bowles et al, 2014; Garcia-Manero et al, 2016; O'Neil et al, 2016), and whether they are ATP-binding competitive or not, these PLK1 inhibitors target on PLK1 kinase activity (Schoffski, 2009) instead of reducing its amount. This feature might limit the application range of the existing PLK1 inhibitors to some extent as not all tumours with high level of PLK1 expression necessarily show arisen kinase activity. In fact, the target diseases of current clinical trials of Volasertib and Rigosertib are quite restricted (Schoffski, 2009) compared with the wide range of PLK1 overexpression (Strebhardt, 2010), and HCC is not included in the trials. Under this circumstance, the finding that dasatinib is able to inhibit protein synthesis of PLK1 presents a new method targeting on PLK1 and might have better universality especially on HCC. Apart from the restricted application range, existing PLK1 inhibitors also have to face potential problems about drug resistance. It is believed that one of the most common reasons why acquired resistance of inhibitors occurs is point mutation of the kinase domain (Daver et al, 2015). Which means, compared with PLK1 inhibitors targeting on kinase activity, dasatinib will suffer less risk of developing acquired resistance, as its mechanism depends on protein synthesis instead of gene level or kinase structure. Given to the close correlation of PLK1 and tumour cell proliferation, enhanced inhibition of PLK1 is naturally related to increased apoptosis (Bucur et al, 2013). It was reported that mitochondria dysfunction could be involved in the progress from PLK1 inhibition to apoptosis (Matsumoto et al, 2009). Consistent with these previous works, our study also revealed that the apoptosis rate of HCC cells was elevated as a result of PLK1 inhibition and mitochondria dysfunction, and a synergistic antitumour effect could be observed both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, PLK1 might be a potential target of dasatinib and the combination treatment of dasatinib and irinotecan/SN38 led to augmented inhibition of PLK1, which subsequently enhanced irinotecan/SN38-induced mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This study presented a promising synergistic antitumour efficacy of a traditional cytotoxic drug and a TKI for HCC and may hopefully inspire novel therapies for the disease.

However, the severe cardiotoxicity of ADR limits its clinical application. So far, the mechanism of the cardiotoxicity of ADR has not been completely clarified. In our research, cardiomyocyte autophagy and cardiac damage were observed in accompany ADR treatment, and autophagy appeared earlier than cardiac damage. Inhibition of autophagy by silencing ATG7 improved the survival rate of cardiomyocytes treated with ADR. The release of HMGB1 increased after ADR treatment, and silencing HMGB1 could reverse cardiomyocyte damage by attenuating autophagy. In addition, the expression of YAP was decreased, and overexpressing YAP down-regulated HMGB1 and alleviated cardiomyocyte damage. These results indicated that autophagy was the leading cause of ADR-induced cardiotoxicity, and HMGB1 played a vital role in the process of up-regulating autophagy.",

        "abstract": "Sunitinib, a multikinase inhibitor approved for a number of cancer indications has a low response rate. Identifying mechanisms of resistance could lead to rational combination regimens that could improve clinical outcomes. Here we report that resistance to sunitinib therapy was driven by autophagic degradation of TP53/p53. Deletion of ATG7 or ATG5 suppressed TP53 degradation, as did knockdown of SQSTM1/p62. Mechanistically, the transport of TP53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was essential for the sunitinib-induced autophagic degradation of TP53 and did not require TP53 nuclear export signals (NESs). Moreover, TP53 degradation was achieved by the transport of its nuclear binding target, HMGB1, which shifted TP53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The inhibition of HMGB1 sensitized cancer cells to sunitinib. Importantly, sunitinib induced the degradation of all TP53 proteins, except for TP53 proteins with mutations in the interaction domain of TP53 with HMGB1 (amino acids 313 to 352). In conclusion, our data identify an alternative HMGB1-mediated TP53 protein turnover mechanism that participates in the resistance of sunitinib and suggest HMGB1 as a potential therapeutic target for improving clinical outcomes of sunitinib.",

        "abstract": "With the use of multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) having emerged in recent years, skin toxicities such as hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) are primary side effects, and they lack effective prediction methods. Here, we updated a previous systematic review by establishing a meta-analysis of the risk of developing HFSR among patients receiving multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) and antivascular endothelial growth factor antibody. Publications from PubMed and abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting up to February 5, 2015 were searched to identify relevant studies, and a total of 236 patients with metastatic tumors in nine trials were included for analysis. In the meta-analysis, the pooled incidence rates of all-grade and high-grade HFSR among patients who received the combination therapy were 56.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 45%-71.1%] and 14.3% (95% CI: 9%-24.2%), respectively, with significant differences observed with MKI monotherapy (P < 0.05). Further subgroup analysis demonstrated that increasing the dosages of bevacizumab (77.8% vs. 51.1%, P = 0.04) and MKIs (64.3% vs. 52.6%, P = 0.02) significantly increased HFSR incidence. Moreover, combination with chemotherapy exerted a minimal effect on HFSR risk (61% vs. 55.3%, P = 0.5). This updated review and meta-analysis confirm the increased risk of HFSR incidence due to the use of MKIs and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody. Thus, using these therapies requires safety standards. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

It has been confirmed that autophagy mediates toxicity of anticancer drugs, especially in heart, liver and neuron. It is important to understand the function and mechanism of autophagy in anticancer drugs-induced toxicity. Given that autophagy is a double-edged sword in the maintenance of the function of heart, liver and neuron, the autophagy-mediated toxicity are very complicated in the body. We provide a review on the concept of autophagy and current status about autophagy-mediated toxicity of anticancer drugs. The knowledge is crucial in the basic study of anticancer drugs-induced toxicity, and provides some strategies for the development of alleviating the toxicity of anticancer drugs.",

In order to make sure the safety of meta-data, the most of cluster file system write the meta-data to disk as soon as possible to suffer the possible failure of underlying facilities, such as node accidentally crash. The synchronous disk write of meta-data is a performance bottle of cluster file system. This paper presents a high performance cooperative synchronous write mechanism for meta-data: CSWM. CSWM is a pure software mechanism which provides the reliability of synchronous write operations with the performance of asynchronous write operations. The meta-data synchronously witted in CSWM are saved on both two cooperative meta-data server before being written to disk. Then, CSWM can ensure the safety of meta-data and improve the cluster file system performance. The experiments in this paper prove that CSWM can effectively improve the performance of cluster file system.",

The MADFS organizes hosts into a hierarchical structure, and uses mobile agents as the underlying facility for transmission, communication and synchronization. We also present a novel cache coherency mechanism for MADFS: hierarchical and convergent cache coherency mechanism (HCCM). HCCM can effectively reduce the overhead of cache coherency management in distributed file system. In this paper, we also build an analysis model for HCMM and compare the performance to single-layer mode. The comparing results show that HCMM has better performance in WAN.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Significant improvements to transfer learning have emerged in recent years, because deep learning has been proposed to learn more higher level and robust features. However, most of existing deep learning approaches are based on the framework of auto-encoder or sparse auto-encoder, which pose challenges for independent component analysis and fail to measure similarities between data spaces. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new strategy to achieve a better feature representation performance for transfer learning. There are several advantages in our method as follows: 1) The model of Stacked Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (SRICA) is used to pursuit an optimal feature representation; 2) The label information is used by Logistic Regression Model to optimize representation features and the distance of distributions between domains is minimized by the method of KL-Divergence. Extensive experiments conducted on several image datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with all competing state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Online transfer learning aims to attack an online learning task on a target domain by transferring knowledge from some source domains, which has received more attentions. And most online transfer learning methods adapt the classifier according to its accuracy on new coming data. However, in real-world applications, such as anomaly detection and credit card fraud detection, the cost may be more important than the accuracy. Moreover, the cost usually changes in these online data, which challenges state-of-art-methods. Therefore, this paper introduces the cost of misclassification into transfer-learning of classifier, and proposes a novel online transfer learning algorithm with adaptive cost (OLAC). Firstly, we introduce the label distribution into traditional Hinge Loss Function to compute the cost of classification adaptively. Secondly, we transfer learn the classifier according to its performance on new coming data including both accuracy and cost. Extensive experimental results show that our method can achieve higher accuracy and less classification lost, especially for the samples with higher costs.\n\n",

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel classification method for short texts with few words which is based on text Hash vectorization and Random Forest. More specifically, the feature representation of texts is obtained by the Hash vectors of all words based on the text segmentation results, and the Random Forest classifier is adopted on the vector feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other competing methods.

        "abstract": "TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) is a validated therapeutic target for the development of oral tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors. Here we report the pre-clinical results and characterization of a selective and potent TACE inhibitor, (2R, 3S)-2-([[4-(2-butynyloxy)phenyl]sulfonyl]amino)-N,3-dihydroxybutanamide (TMI-2), in various in vitro and in vivo assays. TMI-2 is a potent TACE inhibitor in an enzymatic FRET assay (IC50=2 nM). It is more than 250-fold selective over MMP-1, -7, -9, -14, and ADAM-10 in vitro. In cell-based assays and human whole blood, TMI-2 inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF secretion with IC50s<1 uM. Importantly, TMI-2 inhibits the spontaneous release of TNF-alpha in human synovium tissue explants of rheumatoid arthritis patients with an IC50 of 0.8 microM. In vivo, TMI-2 potently inhibits LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in mice (ED50=3 mg/kg). In the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model in rats, treatment with TMI-2 at 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d. was highly effective in reducing joint arthritis scores. In a semi-therapeutic collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in mice, TMI-2 is highly effective in reducing disease severity scores after oral treatment at 100 mg/kg twice per day. In summary, TMI-2 is a potent and selective TACE inhibitor that inhibits TNF-alpha production and reduces the arthritis scores in pre-clinical models. TMI-2 represents a novel class of TACE inhibitors that may be effective and beneficial in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as well as other TNF-mediated inflammatory autoimmune diseases.",

Methods Forty mice were randomly divided into four groups: PBS control group, RSV group, OVA group and OVA/RSV group. Cells in BALF were counted and classified and the supernatants of the bronchoalvoelar lavage fluid(BALF) were used for the detection of IL-4, Il-5 and IFN-\u03b3. Histopathological changes were checked by HE staining. The percentage of CD4+(IFN-\u03b3+, IL-4+, IL-5+), CD8+(IFN-\u03b3+, IL-4+, IL-5+) T lymphocyte and the ratio of T_H2/T_H1, Tc2/Tc1 in peribronchial lymph nodes(PBLN) were analysed by three-color flow cytometry method. Results Total BALF cells, eosinophils and lymphocytes from OVA/RSV group were significantly higher than those in OVA group respectively(P<0.01); more eosinophils were founde in OVA/RSV group than that in RSV group(P<0.01). IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-5 levels in BALF from OVA/RSV group increased greatly as compared with OVA group(P<0.01 respectively); meanwhile there is no marked change in IFN-\u03b3 level(P>0.05), but IL-4, IL-5 levels increased in OVA/RSV group as compared with RSV group respectively(P<0.01). More marked and extensive airway inflammatory cells infiltration in OVA/RSV group were observed than that in all the other groups. The percentage of CD8+(IFN-\u03b3+, IL-4+, IL-5+) T lymphocyte and the ratio of Tc2/Tc1 from the OVA/RSV group were significantly higher than those in OVA group respectively(P<0.01) but there is no marked change in the ratio of T_H2/T_H1; the percentage of CD4+(IL-4+, IL-5+), CD8+(IL-4+, IL-5+) T lymphocyte, the ratio of T_H2/T_H1 and Tc2/Tc1 from OVA/RSV group were higher than those in RSV group respectively(P<0.01). Conclusion RSV infection in OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice caused severe airway inflammation which resulted in the increase of T_H1-like and T_H2-like cytokine response. RSV infection in OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice also induced the increase of the cell count and function change of CD8+ T lymphocyte, namely CD8+ T lymphocyte transfer from Tc1 which is characterized by excreting IFN-\u03b3 to Tc2 excreting IL-4 and IL-5, which maybe explain the increase of IL-4, IL-5 and the gathering of eosinophils in the airway.",

The severe asthma model was reproduced by sensitization with intraperitoneal injection of OVA, followed by repeated inhalation of OVA combined with repeated intranasal instillation of RSV (1.0x10(9) pfu/L in 50 microl). Asthmatic symptoms were observed. The changes in airway responsiveness represented by lung resistance (R(L)) stimulated by acetylcholine (Ach) and function of lung in terms of peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 0.4 second (FEV 0.4) /forced vital capacity (FVC) were determined. Lung tissue sections with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining for general pathology, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining for identification of goblet cells mucus secretion and Masson staining for pathologic changes in lung tissue and remodeling were examined. The ratio of inner diameter to outer diameter of the airway, and the thickness of smooth muscle and basement membrane were determined.(1) The differences in R(L), PEF and ratio of FEV 0.4 /FVC both in OVA/RSV group and OVA group were significant when compared with those in PBS control group when stimulated by Ach (5.0, 15.0 and 45.0 g/L) (respectively P<0.01). Asthma symptoms were more severe in OVA/RSV group, compared with those of OVA group. Total R(L) was increased and PEF and ratio of FEV 0.4 /FVC were decreased in OVA/RSV group compared with those of OVA group (respectively P<0.01). There were more severe bronchoconstriction and more extensive inflammatory cells (eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophils) infiltration around the bronchi in the OVA/RSV group. A marked and extensive airway goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus excretion in airway lumen and deposition of collagen in subepithelial basement membrane were found in the OVA/RSV group. (2) The ratio of inner diameter to outer diameter and that of the thickness of smooth muscle and basement membrane were 0.56+/-0.03, (45.12+/-2.08) microm and (36.15+/-1.88) microm, respectively, in OVA/RSV group, and the differences were significant (respectively P<0.01), as compared with OVA group [0.75+/-0.06, (24.63+/-0.94) microm and (21.68+/-1.13) microm, respectively].An animal model of severe asthma is successfully reproduced by nasal inoculation with RSV in OVA-sensitized Balb/C mice.",

METHODS: Fifty mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=10 each group): PBS control group, OVA group, OVA/RSV group, anti-CD8mAb treated group and IgG2\u03b1mAb treated control group. Lung histopathological changes were evaluated by HE stain. Airway responsiveness was assessed using a whole body plethysmography. Cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BALF) were counted and classified and the supernatants of the BALF were used for detection of interleukin(IL)-4, IL-5 and interferon(IFN)-\u03b3. The percentage of CD4~+(IFN-\u03b3~+, IL-4~+, IL-5~+), CD8~+(IFN-\u03b3~+, IL-4~+, IL-5~+)T lymphocytes and the ratio of Th2/Th1, Tc2/Tc1 in peribronchial lymph nodes(PBLN) were analysed by three-color flow cytometry method. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal administration of anti-CD8mAb can remarkably inhibit airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness(AHR). Eosinophils and IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-5 levels in BALF decreased in anti-CD8mAb therapeutic group compared with OVA/RSV group(P<0.01, respectively). The percentage of CD8~+(IFN-\u03b3~+, IL-4~+, IL-5~+)T lymphocytes and the ratio of Tc2/Tc1 decreased in anti-CD8mAb therapeutic group compared with OVA/RSV group(P<0.01, respectively). A close correlation between the percentage of CD8~+(IFN-\u03b3~+, IL-4~+, IL-5~+)T lymphocytes and IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-5 levels in BALF from OVA/RSV group, anti-CD8mAb therapeutic group was demonstrated (r_s=0.765, P<0.01; r_s=0.825, P<0.01; r_s=0.893, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Anti-CD8mAb might suppress airway inflammation and AHR through the mechanism that CD8~+T lymphocytes transfer from Tc1 to Tc2, which may be relative to the increase of IL-4, IL-5, the gathering of inflammatory cells in the airway and AHR.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effects of respiratory syncytial virus(RSV) infection on the dynamic changes of airway hyperresponsiveness(AHR) in ovalbumin(OVA)-induced asthma in mice.Methods 60 BALB/c female mice were randomly divided into PBS control group(A group,n=6),OVA group,OVA/RSV group,dexamethasone group(D group,n=6).Kinetics of AHR of OVA group mice was carried out on day 21,25,29 and 33(B1,B2,B3,B4 groups,n=6),and the same with the OVA/RSV group(C1,C2,C3,C4 groups,n=6).The mouse asthma model was established by OVA-sensitization of intraperitoneal injection and repeated inhalation of OVA while the mice in OVA/RSV group were treated with combined intranasal inoculation with RSV(1.0\u00d7106 pfu/mL in 50 \u03bcL).Airway resistance of expiring phase(RL) and compliance of throax and lung(CTL) with different doses of acetylcholine(Ach) were measured.Lung tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin(HE) and periodic acid-Schiff(PAS) for general morphology.Results Compared with B1 group,RL increased and CTL decreased in C1 group when Ach dose is above 5 g/L(P<0.05,respectively),and the effects prolonged(6 d,10 d after challenge with OVA,respectively) much more than B1 group(2 d after challenge with OVA).Compared with C1 group,RL decreased and CTL increased in D group and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was obviously alleviated in C1 group after treatment with dexamethasone.Conclusions Airway hyperresponsiveness increases obviously in OVA-sensitized and RSV-infected mice.The prolonged increase in RL and decrease in CTL(6 d,10 d,respectively)may imply that RSV infection aggravates airway inflammation.The small airway inflammation may play a critical role in the persistence of airway hyperresponsiveness.",

From July 2003 to September 2005, 44 inpatients suffering from stroke in Jiangsu Province Hospital were enrolled in this study. All the subjects were randomized into two groups.Group A received ULEM therapy and conventional physical therapy (PT) aand group B received PT only. Blood pressure, pulse, Brunnstrom stage and Barthel Index were tested before and after 20 days' treatment.In group A, according to Brunnstrom stage, the effective rates of hand, upper extremities and lower extremities were 20.0%, 80.0% and 100.0%, respectively, and the total effective rate improved significantly compared to that of group B (p < 0.05), especially lower extremities (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in Barthel Indexes between two groups (p > 0.05).ULEM apparatus can significantly improve integrative motor function of extremities of patients with stroke. It is a safe and effective treatment.",

This lack of evidence may be due to poor study design, small sample size, and insufficient theoretical background.The present study was designed to determine whether acupuncture combined with conventional physical therapy improves motor function and activities of daily living in patients with subacute stroke compared with conventional physical therapy alone.A multicenter, single-blinded, randomized study was conducted.Four rehabilitation centers in the Jiangsu province of China participated in this study.One hundred eighty-eight patients with subacute stroke admitted to the hospital were randomized into an acupuncture group and a conventional rehabilitation group.A combination of body and scalp acupuncture was used for 3 months in the acupuncture group. All patients underwent conventional stroke rehabilitation.The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and Barthel Index (BI) were performed at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months after inclusion in the study.No statistically significant differences were found at baseline between the groups. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups using the FMA motor scores and the BI scores at baseline or at 1, 3, or 6 months. Significant improvements were found in each group following treatment.In patients with subacute stroke, the addition of body and scalp acupuncture to a regimen of conventional physical therapy does not result in further improvement in either motor function or ADL beyond the effect of conventional physical therapy alone.",

        "abstract": "The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of a specially designed moderate-intensity aerobic dance (SDMIAD) on brain spontaneous activity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). A total of 38 subjects with MCI were recruited to the current study and were randomized into two groups: Exercise (EG, n=19) and control (CG, n=19). The EG was treated with a SDMIAD and usual care for 3 months. The CG only received usual care. None of the patients were administered medicine that affected cognition during the intervention. The cognitive assessments and RS-fMRI examination were performed on the two groups at recruitment and after 3 months. The cognitive functions were assessed by various neuropsychological tests. The brain spontaneous activity change was assessed using an index, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of fMRI signal. Cognitive assessments demonstrated that EG had significantly improved results in the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory (WMS-R LM) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (all P<0.05), and the difference in changes in WMS-R LM from baseline to 3 months between the EG and the CG was also statistically significant (P<0.05) after 3 months of SDMIAD. The performance of all the cognitive assessments did not demonstrate significant differences in CG. Compared with baseline, EG exhibited significantly increased ALFF in several areas, including the bilateral fronto-temporal, entorhinal, anterior cingulate and parohippocampal cortex after 3 months of SDMIAD (P<0.05); whereas the CG exhibited significantly increased ALFF only in a few areas, including right temporal and posterior cingulate cortex (P<0.05). The SDMIAD may effectively improve the cognitive function in older adults with MCI. RS-fMRI provided a quantitative method for evaluating the effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive function.",

NF-kappaB repression by arsenic trioxide (As2O3) contributes to apoptosis of eosinophils (EOS) in airways. Here we provide evidence that As2O3 abrogates allergen (OVA)-induced airway eosinophilia by modulating the expression of IkappaBalpha, an NF-kappaB inhibitory protein, and decreases the airway hyperresponsiveness.Using a murine model of asthma, the airway hyperresponsiveness was conducted by barometric whole-body plethysmography. Airway eosinophilia, OVA-specific IgE in serum, and chemokine eotaxin and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured by lung histology, Diff-Quick staining, and ELISA. Chemokine-induced EOS chemotactic activity was evaluated using EOS chemotaxis assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot analysis were performed to assess pulmonary NF-kappaB activation and IkappaBalpha expression, respectively.As2O3 attenuated the allergen-induced serum IgE, chemokine expression of eotaxin and RANTES, and the EOS recruitment in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which is associated with an increased IkappaBalpha expression as well as a decreased NF-kappaB activation. Also, As2O3 suppressed the chemotaxis of EOS dose-dependently in vitro. Additionally, As2O3 significantly ameliorated the allergen-driven airway hyperresponsiveness, the cardinal feature underlying asthma.These findings demonstrate an essential role of NF-kappaB in airway eosinophilia, and illustrate a potential dissociation between airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. As2O3 likely exerts its broad anti-inflammatory effects by suppression of NF-kappaB activation through augmentation of IkappaBalpha expression in asthma.",

However, the cellular mechanism of CD8+ T cells, linking viral respiratory infections to the development of airway inflammation, is not well defined.To clarify the role of CD8+ T cells in the development of respiratory virus-induced asthma exacerbations.Using a murine model of prior ovalbumin exposure and subsequent respiratory syncytial virus infection, the airway responsiveness was assessed by barometric whole-body plethysmography. Airway eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophils as well as IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured by Diff-Quick staining and ELISA. The frequency of cytokine-producing CD8+ T lymphocytes in peribronchial lymph nodes was detected using 2-color immunofluorescence analysis. Histological examinations were carried out using hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry.Anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (1 mg/kg) clearly inhibited increases in airway responsiveness to acetylcholine and markedly reduced the number of eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes as well as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Furthermore, the antibody also attenuated airway inflammation and CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration in lung tissue.These findings suggest that CD8+ T lymphocytes play a critical role for the development of respiratory syncytial virus-induced airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness.",

        "abstract": "Much evidence suggests that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection prolongs airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and exacerbates asthma by enhancing airway inflammation. However, the characteristic of airway inflammation and kinetics of airway dysfunction occurred in the central and peripheral airways were not fully delineated. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of RSV on the allergic airway inflammation in different size airways and to elucidate its possible mechanism. Using a murine model of prior ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and subsequent RSV challenge, lung resistance (R(L)), and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was conducted by barometric whole-body plethysmography. Histological examinations were carried out. Differential cells count in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, serum anti-OVA IgE, and IgG1 were measured. Cytokine mRNA expression in lung tissue were determined. RSV triggered a significant increase in R(L) and reduction in Cdyn, as well as greatly prolonged the recovery of Cdyn more than that of R(L) in OVA-sensitized mice. Also, RSV resulted in more severe peripheral airway inflammation which exhibit as globe cell hyperplasia and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Furthermore, the number of lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages in BAL fluid, serum anti-OVA IgE and IgG1 were remarkably increased. Additionally, mice increased relative expression of cytokines IL-4, IL-13, and IFN-\u03b3, but not IL-5, IL-17, and IL-17F. These findings demonstrated that RSV could selectively affect pathologic processes that contribute to altered airway function in the central and peripheral airways in OVA-sensitized mice. These processes may be involved in goblet cell hyperplasia and CD8+ T cell infiltration in peripheral airways.",

The successful formation of PAH/micelle multilayers on both planar and curved substrates was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and xi-potential measurements. The PS- b-PAA micelles retained their structure during the whole assembly process. The as-prepared microcapsules showed extraordinary stability against concentrated HCl (37%) and 0.1 M NaOH solutions. No variation in capsule size or shape was observed in acidic solution, while slight swelling and distortion of the capsules took place in alkaline solution. However, these capsules completely recovered their original size and morphology after being incubated in acidic solution again. The microcapsules, in which large voids exist between the micelle grains on the walls, were totally permeable to fluorescein-tagged dextran with an M(w) of 2000 kDa. Assembly of additional PAH/poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) multilayers could substantially reduce the permeation of the same molecules.

The growth pattern of the multilayer film was largely influenced by the environmental pH condition. Hollow capsules with variable size and wall thickness were obtained by assembly on CaCO 3 microparticles and subsequent template removal. The as-prepared capsules remained stable in the pH range 6-9 for 1 h and could survive 3 M urea treatment for at least 1 h. They could specifically respond to or even be destroyed by mannose, fructose, glucose and dextran (M w 20 kDa and 40 kDa) at the physiological pH condition, but not by other types of carbohydrates such as lactose and galactose. The responses were dependent on both the molecular weight and the concentration of the carbohydrates regardless of the environmental pH condition (pH 6-9). Finally, the capsules were employed as delivery vehicles for poly(styrene-b-acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) micelles, which could be partly released under the triggering of glucose or dextran (M w 20 kDa). With the combination of good stability and specific responsiveness to various carbohydrates, as well as the possibility of loading and releasing functional nano-objects, these microcapsules could be promising candidates as advanced drug delivery carriers and micro-reactors. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Development of spoken dialog systems (SDSs) can be facilitated by better evaluation methods. Previous methods seldom consider the efficiency of the system, which is important to users. We study the problem of evaluating SDSs and propose a new framework by generalizing states from utterances of dialogs to build finite state machine (FSM). These states can be regarded as efficiency measurement of SDSs. The FSM framework models dialogs as paths in an FSM to combine efficiency measurement with regression models. The proposed FSM framework can be applied in conjunction with regression models to improve evaluation accuracy. We compare our FSM framework combined with three regression models in several experiments. We obtain promising results on a collection of dialogs from the \u201cLet's Go!\u201d system, with our approach outperforming regression models.",

        "abstract": "User evaluations of dialogs from a spoken dialog system (SDS) can be directly used to gauge the system's performance. However, it is costly to obtain manual evaluations of a large corpus of dialogs. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a possible solution. This process learns from a small amount of manually labeled data, together with a large amount of unlabeled data, and can later be used to perform automatic labeling. We conduct comparative experiments among SSL approaches, classical regression and supervised learning in evaluation of dialogs from CMU's Let's Go Bus Information System. Two typical SSL methods, namely co-training and semi-supervised support vector machine (S3VM), are found to outperform the other approaches in automatically predicting user evaluations of unseen dialogs in the case of low training rate.",

        "abstract": "The small heat shock protein alphaB-crystallin interacts with N2B-Us, a large unique sequence found in the N2B element of cardiac titin. Using single molecule force spectroscopy, we studied the effect of alphaB-crystallin on the N2B-Us and its flanking Ig-like domains. Ig domains from the proximal tandem Ig segment of titin were also studied. The effect of wild type alphaB-crystallin on the single molecule force-extension curve was determined as well as that of mutant alphaB-crystallins harboring the dilated cardiomyopathy missense mutation, R157H, or the desmin-related myopathy mutation, R120G. Results revealed that wild type alphaB-crystallin decreased the persistence length of the N2B-Us (from approximately 0.7 to approximately 0.2 nm) but did not alter its contour length. alphaB-crystallin also increased the unfolding force of the Ig domains that flank the N2B-Us (by 51 +/- 3 piconewtons); the rate constant of unfolding at zero force was estimated to be approximately 17-fold lower in the presence of alphaB-crystallin (1.4 x 10(-4) s(-1) versus 2.4 x 10(-3) s(-1)). We also found that alphaB-crystallin increased the unfolding force of Ig domains from the proximal tandem Ig segment by 28 +/- 6 piconewtons. The effects of alphaB-crystallin were attenuated by the R157H mutation (but were still significant) and were absent when using the R120G mutant. We conclude that alphaB-crystallin protects titin from damage by lowering the persistence length of the N2B-Us and reducing the Ig domain unfolding probability. Our finding that this effect is either attenuated (R157H) or lost (R120G) in disease causing alphaB-crystallin mutations suggests that the interaction between alphaB-crystallin and titin is important for normal heart function.",

        "abstract": "This study was performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the pretreatment serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels in a Chinese cohort of patients with early-stage or locally advanced cervical cancer. The pretreatment serum GGT levels were examined in 290 cervical cancer patients with stage I-III disease and 230 healthy controls selected from a cancer-free population in the same region. Patients were assigned to normal or high-risk GGT groups, as previously described, and the GGT levels were correlated to clinicopathologic parameters and survival data. The GGT levels in cervical cancer patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (35.6 \u00b1 29.1 vs. 24.1 \u00b1 14.7 U/L,  < 0.001). In addition, the pretreatment serum GGT levels were associated with the histology type ( = 0.023), lymph node involvement ( = 0.040), stage ( = 0.029), recurrence ( = 0.015) and death ( = 0.005), but not with age ( = 0.432), tumor size ( = 0.067) or degree of differentiation ( = 0.901). Moreover, univariate survival analysis revealed that patients with high GGT levels tended to have poorer disease-free survival (DFS) [hazard ratio (HR), 1.721; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.189-2.491;  = 0.004] and overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.929; 95% CI, 1.294-2.876;  = 0.001) compared to those with normal GGT levels. However, a multivariate Cox-regression model did not support these data (HR, 1.373; 95% CI, 0.925-2.039;  = 0.116 for DFS and HR, 1.357; 95% CI, 0.887-2.078;  = 0.160 for OS, respectively) after adjusting for other confounding variables. High pretreatment serum GGT was associated with more advanced tumor behavior, but could not serve as an independent prognostic indicator in patients with early-stage or locally advanced cervical cancer.",

They were divided into the control and test groups according to the method of achieving anesthesia. Variations in associated indexes after anesthesia were compared to evaluate the anesthetic effect.Results: The test and control groups show no significant differences in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and Heart Rate (HR) at different periods (Pu003e0.05). In the test group, the SBP, DBP, and MAP significantly decrease, whereas the HR significantly increases 10 min after the anesthesia (P 0.05). The test group consumes significantly shorter time for tracheal cannulation after anesthesia and receives better oxyhemoglobin saturation compared with the control group (Pu003c0.05).Conclusions: Superior laryngeal nerve block combined with thyrocricocentesis TSA provides ideal and safe anesthesia to patients needing emergency tracheal cannulation for cerebral trauma.",

        "abstract": "Sevoflurane is a widely used anesthetics in surgery and considered as a safe reagent for clinical use. However, recent studies demonstrated that sevoflurane has a neurotoxic effect in central nervous system. Thus, finding ways to alleviate the side effect of sevoflurane is of importance. In this study, we identified the neuroprotective role of midazolam in hippocampal neurons. Midazolam treatment could alleviate the neuronal death and promote the neuronal maturation in hippocampal neurons in vitro. In vivo studies demonstrated that midazolam injection could improve behavioral deficit in sevoflurane-exposed animals. The anti-apoptotic function of midazolam in sevoflurane-exposed neurons was mediated by ERK signaling. Collectively, we elucidated a new role of midazolam in preventing hippocampal neuronal death from sevoflurane exposure, potentially providing a new strategy to resist the neurotoxicity in the clinical application of sevoflurane.",

        "abstract": "Objective: This study compared the post-anesthesia delirium in elderly patients treated with Dexmedetomidine and Midazolam Maleate after thoracic surgery.Methods: A total of 92 elderly patients treated with thoracic surgery in our hospital from June to September 2015 were selected. Digital random method was used to equally divide them into group A (n=46) and group B (n=46). Both groups were given with a continuous intravenous pumping of fentanyl for analgesia. Dexmedetomidine for group A and Midazolam Maleate for group B, and the delirium occurrence rates of patients in the two groups after the surgery were compared.Results: Awaking time 4.92 \u00b1 1.18 min, breathing recovery time 10.53 \u00b1 2.25 min, and extubation time 11.36 \u00b1 2.63 min of patients in group A were significantly shorter than those in group B (P 0.05). The MMSE scores 27.01 \u00b1 0.46, 27.22 \u00b1 0 .50, 27.73 \u00b1 0.54 and 28.62 \u00b1 0.63 of patients in group A and 6 h and 1, 2 and 3 d after the surgery were significantly higher than those in the control group, and comparative difference between the two groups had statistical significance (P 0.05).Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine can improve the postoperative cognitive functions of elderly patients treated with thoracic surgery and reduce postoperative delirium.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel communication model based on a modified stochastic branching process to support data exchange between smart things connected via ad hoc networks. Ad hoc networks are believed to be a good fit for dynamic network infrastructure which can be disconnected, intermittent, and limited (DIL). Our approach aims to balance reachability, node usage, and average branching factor in message transmission by controlling the local transmssion ratio based on concurrent local topology. We first introduce the modified stochastic branching model for message delivery and prove its reachability in an infinite graph. A distributed algorithm, named Smart Multicast (SM), is proposed based on the stochastic branching model. Finally, numerical results comparing the proposed algorithm with other well-known flooding and gossip transmission algorithms confirms that the reachability, node usage, and branching factor are better balanced through the SM algorithm.",

        "abstract": "A promoter of the PNZIP (Pharbitis nil leucine zipper) gene (1.459 kb) was cloned from Pharbitis nil and fused to the GUS (\u03b2-glucuronidase) and Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxin (Cry9C) genes. Several transgenic PNZIP::GUS and PNZIP::Cry9C cotton lines were developed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Strong GUS staining was detected in the green tissues of the transgenic PNZIP::GUS cotton plants. In contrast, GUS staining in the reproductive structures such as petals, anther, and immature seeds of PNZIP::GUS cotton was very faint. Two transgenic PNZIP::Cry9C lines and one transgenic cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S::Cry9C line were selected for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and insect bioassays. Expression of the Cry9C protein in the 35S::Cry9C line maintained a high level in most tissues ranging from 24.6 to 45.5 \u03bcg g(-1) fresh weight. In green tissues such as the leaves, boll rinds, and bracts of the PNZIP::Cry9C line, the Cry9C protein accumulated up to 50.2, 39.7, and 48.3 \u03bcg g(-1) fresh weight respectively. In contrast, seeds of the PNZIP::Cry9C line (PZ1.3) accumulated only 0.26 \u03bcg g(-1) fresh weight of the Cry9C protein, which was 100 times lower than that recorded for the seeds of the CaMV 35S::Cry9C line. The insect bioassay showed that the transgenic PNZIP::Cry9C cotton plant exhibited strong resistance to both the cotton bollworm and the pink bollworm. The PNZIP promoter could effectively drive Bt toxin expression in green tissues of cotton and lower accumulated levels of the Bt protein in seeds. These features should allay public concerns about the safety of transgenic foods. We propose the future utility of PNZIP as an economical, environmentally friendly promoter in cotton biotechnology.",

        "abstract": "To more effectively control two \nmajor cotton insects (cotton bollworm and Spodoptera litura) and improve the efficacy of the pest resistance management, novel transgenic plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis Cry9C gene were generated, and gene stacking strategy was incorporated. Initially, a binary plasmid vector harboring Cry9C gene was introduced into an elite cotton cultivar Simian-3 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Integration and expression of the Cry9C genes in three transgenic lines were confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR. Among these transgenic lines, T0 generation of line 16 (L-16) with normal phenotypes were selected by ELISA assays for its highest expression level of Cry9C. In T1 population of L-16, the expression level of Cry9C ranged from 29 to 45\u00a0\u03bcg/g fresh leaf. The following insect bioassays demonstrated that transgenic S3-35S::Cry9C cotton plants exhibited moderate toxicity to Heliothis armigera but strong toxicity to S. litura compared with the transgenic plants expressing Cry 1Ac gene. For incorporation of gene staking strategy, Cry9C gene and Cry 2A or Cry 1Ac were pyramided, respectively by sexual crossing. The expression of Cry9C protein in all F1 progenies had a similar level as the parent plants indicating the high heritability of Bt genes in transgenic progenies. Progenies from both Cry9C\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Cry 2A and Cry9C\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Cry 1Ac exhibited higher resistance to S. litura compared with their parents. Together our data demonstrated that our newly generated transgenic plants represent a reservoir of novel insect-resistant materials in cotton breeding, and the successful incorporation of gene pyramiding technology can provide a new solution of developing multiple resistance management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Genes encoding reporter proteins are used as visual marker-assisted tools in genetic transformation as well as plant breeding. In this study, the red fluorescent protein identified in  Discosoma  sp. coral (DsRed2) was successfully used as a visual marker for cotton genetic engineering. DsRed2 was successfully expressed in two cotton cultivars, JIN668 and YZ1, driven by the CaMV-35S promoter via the  Agrobacterium -mediated transformation. Our results suggest that  DsRed2  expression provides an early-stage selection tool for the transgenic calli via visual observation. Red fluorescence can be detected not only in callus and somatic embryos but also in most tissues and organs of mature plants. The transgenic line Yz-2- DsRed2  was crossed with four different cotton cultivars to assess the transgene heritability and stability in different genetic backgrounds. The heritability of the red color was highly stable when Yz-2- DsRed2  was used as a male parent. The  DsRed2  gene expressed 100% in the F 1  hybrids. To investigate the relationship between  DsRed2  transcription and DNA methylation, a methylation-specific PCR approach was applied to the CaMV-35S promoter region. The results showed a negative association between DNA methylation level in the promoter region and the transgene transcription. Taken together, these findings suggest  DsRed2  a visual reporter gene for cotton genetic transformation and molecular breeding programs.",

Here we aimed at characterizing a new function of one of the subtypes of growth factor receptors (GFR), GFR\u03b12, in pancreatic cancer. In this study, we showed that GFR\u03b12 was up-regulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and was positively correlated with tumor size and perineural invasion, which indicated that it may be associated with cell growth and apoptosis. Mechanically, we discovered that high GFR\u03b12 expression level leads to PTEN inactivation via enhancing Mir-17-5p level.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a template-based facial caricature generation approach. Since the major difficulty in generating facial caricature automatically is the uniqueness of individuals and the polymorphism of features, a modified Active Shape Model (ASM) is first designed to locate key feature points accurately by using 2D local grey-level structures. Then, extracted facial components are classified into low-accuracy ones and high-accuracy ones according to their fitting accuracy and are processed respectively. Hierarchical clustering combined with the template-based method is employed for low-accuracy components to bridge the gap between the accuracy provided by feature localization and that required by caricature generation. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the presented approach. \u00a92009 IEEE.",

Modified exemplar-based texture synthesis method is applied to the detail layer in order to synthesize texture details in over-exposed regions. The synthesized texture is combined with the original texture and fed to the lightness and color correction modules to get the final result. An efficient diffusion-like color correction method is presented. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that the proposed method produces vivid details which are absent in previous methods without human assistance in over-exposed regions.

First a CLM (constrained local models) and CQF (convex quadratic fitting) based face alignment approach is utilized to obtain initial locations of key facial features. Then facial components (eyebrow, eye, nose and mouth) are classified respectively into different categories defined by configuration and appearance in consistent with Chinese-Physiognomy. The mapping relationship between feature attributes and corresponding categories is learnt from a preclassified training set using the decision tree classification algorithm. Finally, separate facial feature cartoon templates are selected according to the classification results and then assembled to form an expressive caricature.

        "abstract": "Constrained local models (CLMs) recently exhibit superior generic performance in facial feature localization over leading holistic gradient descent methods, such as active appearance models (AAMs). However, due to representing shape variations with a single deterministic PCA (Principal Component Analysis) model, canonical CLMs may suffer inherent drawbacks when applied to faces with large non-rigid shape variations. To solve the problem, this paper presents a probabilistic constrained local model (PCLM) via introducing probabilistic concepts into the canonical CLM framework. The PCLM consists of an ensemble of patch experts estimating likelihood of multiple candidate positions for each facial landmark, and a shape prior model based on mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA). The shape and pose parameters of the model are estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm within a maximum-likelihood framework. Experimental results prove that the proposed PCLM is capable of dealing with face images of large non-rigid shape variations and noises.",

        "abstract": "The use of social TV applications to enhance the experience of live event broadcasts has become an increasingly common practice. An event profile, defined as a set of keywords relevant to an event, can help to track messages related to these events on social networks. We propose an event profiler that retrieves relevant and interesting tweets in a continuous stream of event-related tweets as they are posted. In our application, these tweets are to be displayed in real time along with the live broadcast of an event. To test our application we have executed a user study. Feedback is collected during a live broadcast by giving the participant the option to like or dislike a tweet, and by judging a selection of tweets on relevancy and interestingness in a post-experiment questionnaire. From the experimental results we conclude that our event profiler is capable to find relevant keywords which leads to retrieval of a higher number of relevant and, on average, more interesting tweets than using only a manually selected keyword.",

Survivability and availability are essential for modern DBMSs, which require the database provide continuous services in the period of recovery, namely dynamic recovery. In this paper, we presented a data recovery model and introduce extended read-write dependency and phantoms dependency to the model. A fine grained transaction log is proposed for data recovery. The log records all the data items of the read and update-involved operations for the committed transactions, and even extracts data items read by the subqueries in the SQL statements. Based on the log, we develop a dynamic recovery system to implement the data recovery model. The system could provide continuous services while the recovery is processing. Experiments based on TPC-W benchmark show that the dynamic recovery system is high-efficient and reliable.",

During the process of the verification, a number of mistakes have been identified and corrections have been made. Both the specification and verification are developed in Coq proof assistant. Our formal security model was improved and has been verified secure.

Damage assessment for data recovery requires a transaction log which record data items read or written by all malicious and benign transactions. Unfortunately, conventional undo/redo log could not record read operations for transactions; and existing auditing mechanisms in DBMS could not capture operations for data items. In this paper, we introduce a concept of \"extended read operations\" and illustrate how the extended read operations would cause the damage spreading, and then a fine grained transaction log (FGTL) is proposed. The log records all the data items of the read only and update-involved operations (read and write) for the committed transactions, and even extracts data items read by the subqueries in the SQL statements. A prototype system denoted FGTL generator is developed to generate the FGTL. Experiments based on TPC-W benchmark show the availability for FGTL generator.",

        "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) often leads to acute kidney injury, chronic renal failure and kidney transplantation failure. Glycyrrhizin is extracted from Glycyrrhiza glabra roots and is the predominant active component, which exhibits anti-inflammatory effects. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of glycyrrhizin on I/R-induced renal injury has not been investigated. In the present study, glycyrrhizin was demonstrated to attenuate renal I/R injury in mice via administration of glycyrrhizin, which suppressed the serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen 6 h following reperfusion; furthermore, the superoxide anions as well as the activity of superoxide dismutase within renal tissues was reduced by glycyrrhizin pretreatment. Moreover, the protein level of cleaved caspase-3, as well as its activity in renal tissue, was suppressed as a result of the glycyrrhizin pretreatment, indicating that glycyrrhizin inhibits I/R-induced renal cell apoptosis. In addition, glycyrrhizin pretreatment appeared to ameliorate I/R-induced renal injury via inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6. The underlying molecular mechanism was investigated and it was shown that the activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was downregulated as a result of glycyrrhizin administration. In conclusion, the present study indicated that glycyrrhizin provided significant protection against I/R-induced renal injury in mice by inhibiting inflammatory responses and renal cell apoptosis. Therefore, glycyrrhizin may be used in abdominal surgery and kidney transplantation for the prevention of renal I/R damage.",

Some studies have been devoted to the relationship between H. pylori infection and oesophageal cancer and have yielded conflicting results. Whether infection of H. pylori is a risk factor for this cancer remains uncertain. In this study we aimed to evaluate the association of H. pylori infection with oesophageal cancer risk.The associated literature was acquired through deliberate searching and selected based on the established inclusion criteria for publications, then the extracted data were further analysed by systematic meta-analyses.In total, 195 articles were identified, of which 12 case-control studies concerning oesophageal cancer were selected. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma risk for H. pylori infection was 0.58-fold (95% confidence interval 0.48-0.70) (Z=5.79, P<0.01) compared with the controls. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma risk was 0.80-fold (95% confidence interval 0.45-1.43) (Z=0.75, P>0.05) compared with the controls. Compared with CagA-negative H. pylori, CagA-positive H. pylori markedly decreased oesophageal cancer risk.The pooled data suggest infection of H. pylori as a possible preventive factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma and failed to suggest a significant association between H. pylori infection and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Adaptation to intermittent high altitude (IHA) hypoxia can protect the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. In view of the fact that both Ca2+ paradox and ischemia-reperfusion injury are associated with the intracellular Ca2+ overload, we tested the hypothesis that IHA hypoxia may protect hearts against Ca2+ paradox-induced lethal injury if its cardioprotection bases on preventing the development of intracellular Ca2+ overload. Langendorff-perfused hearts from normoxic and IHA hypoxic rats were subjected to Ca2+ paradox (5 min of Ca2+ depletion followed by 30 min of Ca2+ repletion) and the functional, biochemical and pathological changes were investigated. The Ca2+ paradox incapacitated the contractility of the normoxic hearts, whereas the IHA hypoxic hearts significantly preserved contractile activity. Furthermore, the normoxic hearts subjected to Ca2+ paradox exhibited a marked reduction in coronary flow, increase in lactate dehydrogenase release, and severe myocyte damage. In contrast, these changes were significantly prevented in IHA hypoxic hearts. We, then, tested and confirmed our hypothesis that the protective mechanisms are mediated by mitochondria ATP-sensitive potassium channels (mitoKATP) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), as the protective effect of IHA hypoxia was abolished by 5-hydroxydecanoate, a selective mitoKATP blocker, and significantly attenuated by KN-93, a CaMKII inhibitor. In conclusion, our studies offer for the first time that IHA hypoxia confers cardioprotection against the lethal injury of Ca2+ paradox and give biochemical evidence for the protective mechanism of IHA hypoxia. We propose that researches in this area may lead a preventive regimen against myocardial injury associated with Ca2+ overload.",

        "abstract": "Cardioprotection by intermittent high-altitude (IHA) hypoxia against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is associated with Ca(2+) overload reduction. Phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation relieves cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-pump ATPase, a critical regulator in intracellular Ca(2+) cycling, from inhibition. To test the hypothesis that IHA hypoxia increases PLB phosphorylation and that such an effect plays a role in cardioprotection, we compared the time-dependent changes in the PLB phosphorylation at Ser(16) (PKA site) and Thr(17) (CaMKII site) in perfused normoxic rat hearts with those in IHA hypoxic rat hearts submitted to 30-min ischemia (I30) followed by 30-min reperfusion (R30). IHA hypoxia improved postischemic contractile recovery, reduced the maximum extent of ischemic contracture, and attenuated I/R-induced depression in Ca(2+)-pump ATPase activity. Although the PLB protein levels remained constant during I/R in both groups, Ser(16) phosphorylation increased at I30 and 1 min of reperfusion (R1) but decreased at R30 in normoxic hearts. IHA hypoxia upregulated the increase further at I30 and R1. Thr(17) phosphorylation decreased at I30, R1, and R30 in normoxic hearts, but IHA hypoxia attenuated the depression at R1 and R30. Moreover, PKA inhibitor H89 abolished IHA hypoxia-induced increase in Ser(16) phosphorylation, Ca(2+)-pump ATPase activity, and the recovery of cardiac performance after ischemia. CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 also abolished the beneficial effects of IHA hypoxia on Thr(17) phosphorylation, Ca(2+)-pump ATPase activity, and the postischemic contractile recovery. These findings indicate that IHA hypoxia mitigates I/R-induced depression in SR Ca(2+)-pump ATPase activity by upregulating dual-site PLB phosphorylation, which may consequently contribute to IHA hypoxia-induced cardioprotection against I/R injury.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we examine crane scheduling for ports. This important component of port operations management is studied when certain spatial constraints, which are common to crane operations, are considered. Although there has been some work on crane scheduling, such spatial constraints have not been previously developed. We assume that ships can be divided into holds and that cranes can move from hold to hold but that only one crane can work on one hold or job at any one time. The objective is to find a crane-to-job matching which will maximize throughput for such operations under these basic spatial constraints. Wepropose two dynamic programming algorithms, prove NP-completeness of the problem and provide heuristics to solve the crane scheduling problem with spatial constraints. We develop Probabilistic Tabu Search techniques for application to the problem which are easy to implement. In experiments, we compare the performance of tabu search with other algorithms applied to the crane scheduling problem.",

To solve the problem of lower convergence speed in compressed sensing iterative algorihtm (ICWF) based on contourlet wiener filtering, a Dai-Yuan linear search step size is used to adjust the convergence speed in this paper, and then an improved ICWF algorithm is proposed. At the same time, the proposed algorithm is applied for astronomical image denoising. Number experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the traditional ICWF algorithm in terms of convergence speed and visual quality, meanwhile which can effectively protect the astronomical image detail information.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, we describe a new multiframe Super-Resolution (SR) framework based on time-scale adaptive Normalized Convolution (NC), and apply it to astronomical images. The method mainly uses the conceptual basis of NC where each neighborhood of a signal is expressed in terms of the corresponding subspace expanded by the chosen polynomial basis function. Instead of the conventional NC, the introduced spatially adaptive filtering kernel is utilized as the applicability function of shape-adaptive NC, which fits the local image structure information including shape and orientation. This makes it possible to obtain image patches with the same modality, which are collected for polynomial expansion to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and suppress aliasing artifacts across lines and edges. The robust signal certainty takes the confidence value at each point into account before a local polynomial expansion to minimize the influence of outliers. Finally, the temporal scale applicability is considered to omit accurate motion estimation since it is easy to result in annoying registration errors in real astronomical applications. Excellent SR reconstruction capability of the time-scale adaptive NC is demonstrated through fundamental experiments on both synthetic images and real astronomical images when compared with other SR reconstruction methods.",

Results showed that although participants have different levels of death thought accessibility between an organ donation scenario and a general charity scenario, their willingness for prosocial behaviors were not significantly different between the two scenarios, indicating that under the influence of Chinese culture MS did not decrease prosocial behaviors. The findings point to the importance of uncovering the role of Chinese philosophy about death and life in shaping people's positive death reflection.",

A total of 120 university student subjects were presented with a series of stereotypically physically attractive (versus physically unattractive) photos before they rated the extent to which each of the three short-term sexual behaviors are morally acceptable. The results showed that male students judged all three behaviors to be more morally acceptable than female students did. Further analyses showed that this gender difference was moderated by the level of physical attractiveness. Under the high attractiveness condition, short-term flings and hookups were judged more morally acceptable by male students than by female students, but this gender difference was not significant under the low attractiveness condition. However, with regard to one-night stands, the data showed that male students judged this type of behavior to be more morally acceptable than did female students under the low attractiveness condition, while this gender difference was not significant under the high attractiveness condition. Thus, these findings further our understanding of how Chinese young people view different types of short-term sexual behaviors, and provide novel evidence regarding how physical attractiveness influences people's moral judgments on short-term sexual behaviors.",

        "abstract": "High-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are persistent organic pollutants with great environmental and human health risks and the associated bioremediation activities have always been hampered by the lack of powerful bacterial species under redox conditions. A Microbacterium sp. strain capable of using benzo(a)pyrene as sole carbon and energy sources under denitrifying conditions was isolated. The difference in protein expression during BaP removal and removal characterization were investigated. A total of 146 proteins were differentially expressed, 44 proteins were significantly up-regulated and 102 proteins were markedly down-regulated. GO and COG analysis showed that BaP removal inhibited the expression of proteins related to glucose metabolism at different levels and activated other metabolic pathway. The proteins associated with catalytic activity and metabolic process were altered significantly. Furthermore, the BaP removal might be occurred in certain organelle of M.CSW3. The strain removed BaP with a speed of 0.0657-1.0072\u00a0mg/L/day over the concentrations range 2.5-100\u00a0mg/L. High removal rates (>70%) were obtained over the range of pH 7-11 in 14\u00a0days. Carbohydrates and organic acids which could be utilized by the strain, as well as heavy metal ions, reduced BaP removal efficiency. However, phenanthrene or pyrene addition enhanced the removal capability of M.CSW3. The strain was proved to have practical potential for bioremediation of PAHs-contaminated soil and this study provided a powerful platform for further application by improving production of associated proteins.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Being electron acceptors, the amount of nitrate (nitrite) significantly affect the benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) biodegradation of  Microbacterium  sp. under denitrifying conditions. In the study, the degradation behavior of  Microbacterium  sp. and the concentration variations of electron acceptors were investigated at different concentration ratios of BaP/nitrate (nitrite). The results showed that compared with reductions in BaP concentration, the extent of BaP degradation and denitrification was significantly affected by C/N ratios. The  Microbacterium  sp. strain could use the denitrifying products nitric oxide and nitrous oxide as electron acceptors to degrade BaP and the shortage of electron acceptors did not decrease the BaP removal rates but lead to a decrease in the BaP degradation. The degree of degradation of BaP could be controled by adding appropriate nitrate (nitrite) which calculated based on the fitting equations of the relationship between nitrate (nitrite) consumption and BaP removal amount. The  Microbacterium  sp. strain performed better under nitrate-reducing condition, and the highest removal rate (84.2%) was obtained at the BaP/nitrate ratio of 1:33 in 10 d. This study will help further mechanism investigation of anaerobic BaP degradation and the conduct of the PAHs bioremediation by adding exogenous electron acceptors.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollution in the reconstructed land of an abandoned industrial site: a coking plant in Beijing. To meet the needs of urban development, many factories have had to be relocated from city centers, and abandoned industrial sites often need to be transformed into residential land or urban green space through a series of restoration measures. It is necessary to study the level of residual pollutants and potential risks associated with industrial reconstructed land. The concentration of 16 PAHs in the study area ranged from 314.7 to 1618.3 \u00b5g/kg, and the average concentration was still at a medium pollution level; the concentration of PAHs in the original coking workshop had the highest levels (1350.5 \u00b5g/kg). The PAHs in the soil were mainly low-ring aromatics, especially naphthalene and phenanthrene. The isomer method and principal component analysis indicated that PAHs in the topsoil were the result of coal and biomass combustion. The seven carcinogenic PAHs were the main contributors to the total toxicity equivalence. The genetic toxicity of benzo[a]pyrene was relatively low, and the results were related to the concentration level. There were potential carcinogenic risks for people of varying ages in this residential area. In total, gender differences were small, and the comprehensive lifetime cancer risk level was still acceptable. For the remaining plots at the study site, the daily intake of PAHs by construction workers was between 0.74\u207b2.31 ng/kg bw/day, which requires further evaluation about ignored area occupational exposure to environmental pollutants.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Biochar is a carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative material produced through thermal decomposition of plant- and animal-based biomass under oxygen-limited conditions. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the application of biochar as an adsorbent, soil ameliorant and climate mitigation approach in many types of applications. Metal-contaminated soil remediation using biochar has been intensively investigated in small-scale and pilot-scale trials with obtained beneficial results and multifaceted effects. But so far, the study and application of biochar in contaminated sediment management has been very limited, and this is also a worldwide problem. Nonetheless, there is reason to believe that the same multiple benefits can also be realized with these sediments due to similar mechanisms for stabilizing contaminants. This paper provides a review on current biochar properties and its use as a sorbent/amendment for metal-contaminated soil/sediment remediation and its effect on plant growth, fauna habits as well as microorganism communities. In addition, the use of biochar as a potential strategy for contaminated sediment management is also discussed, especially as regards  in-situ  planning. Finally, we highlight the possibility of biochar application as an effective amendment and propose further research directions to ensure the safe and sustainable use of biochar as an amendment for remediation of contaminated soil and sediment.",

A carrier concentration of up to 2.12\u2009\u00d7\u20091020 and a saturation magnetization of up to 12.14\u2009emu/cm3 are obtained, and Mott variable range hopping mainly dominates the conduction mechanism of the films.

        "abstract": "Scene images usually involve semantic correlations, particularly when considering large-scale image data sets. This paper proposes a novel generative image representation, correlated topic vector, to model such semantic correlations. Oriented from the correlated topic model, correlated topic vector intends to naturally utilize the correlations among topics, which are seldom considered in the conventional feature encoding, e.g., Fisher vector, but do exist in scene images. It is expected that the involvement of correlations can increase the discriminative capability of the learned generative model and consequently improve the recognition accuracy. Incorporated with the Fisher kernel method, correlated topic vector inherits the advantages of Fisher vector. The contributions to the topics of visual words have been further employed by incorporating the Fisher kernel framework to indicate the differences among scenes. Combined with the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) features and Gibbs sampling solution, correlated topic vector shows great potential when processing large-scale and complex scene image data sets. Experiments on two scene image data sets demonstrate that correlated topic vector improves significantly the deep CNN features, and outperforms existing Fisher kernel-based features.",

        "abstract": "Weakly supervised object localization remains challenging, where only image labels instead of bounding boxes are available during training. Object proposal is an effective component in localization, but often computationally expensive and incapable of joint optimization with some of the remaining modules. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we for the first time integrate weakly supervised object proposal into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end learning manner. We design a network component, Soft Proposal (SP), to be plugged into any standard convolutional architecture to introduce the nearly cost-free object proposal, orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods. In the SP-augmented CNNs, referred to as Soft Proposal Networks (SPNs), iteratively evolved object proposals are generated based on the deep feature maps then projected back, and further jointly optimized with network parameters, with image-level supervision only. Through the unified learning process, SPNs learn better object-centric filters, discover more discriminative visual evidence, and suppress background interference, significantly boosting both weakly supervised object localization and classification performance. We report the best results on popular benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ImageNet.",

        "abstract": "Weakly supervised instance segmentation with image-level labels, instead of expensive pixel-level masks, remains unexplored. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by exploiting class peak responses to enable a classification network for instance mask extraction. With image labels supervision only, CNN classifiers in a fully convolutional manner can produce class response maps, which specify classification confidence at each image location. We observed that local maximums, i.e., peaks, in a class response map typically correspond to strong visual cues residing inside each instance. Motivated by this, we first design a process to stimulate peaks to emerge from a class response map. The emerged peaks are then back-propagated and effectively mapped to highly informative regions of each object instance, such as instance boundaries. We refer to the above maps generated from class peak responses as Peak Response Maps (PRMs). PRMs provide a fine-detailed instance-level representation, which allows instance masks to be extracted even with some off-the-shelf methods. To the best of our knowledge, we for the first time report results for the challenging image-level supervised instance segmentation task. Extensive experiments show that our method also boosts weakly supervised pointwise localization as well as semantic segmentation performance, and reports state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO.",

        "abstract": "Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a disease of heterotopic ossification in spinal ligaments. The key of the OLF pathogenesis is the differentiation of fibroblasts into osteoblasts. In this study, we explored the role of miR-615-3p in the osteogenic differentiation of human LF cells. The expression of miR-615-3p was detected during the osteogenic differentiation of hFOB1.19 human osteoblasts, human BMSCs, and human LF cells. The qPCR results showed that miR-615-3p was being decreased during the osteogenic differentiation of these cell lineages. Then, both gain- and loss-function experiments, respectively performed by single-strand miR-615-3p mimic and antagomir, revealed that miR-615-3p negatively regulated the osteogenesis of hLF cells, manifested by a lighter staining degree with Alizarin Red and a decreased level of osteogenic marker genes, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), RUNX2, osterix (ostx), osteocalcin (OCN), and osteopontin (OPN). Subsequently, our data on bioinformatic analysis, 3'-UTR luciferase activity assay, and protein level detection indicated that miR-615-3p directly targeted and suppressed the expression of FOXO1 and GDF5. Furthermore, knockdown of either FOXO1 or GDF5 could inhibit the osteogenic differentiation of hLF cells, which displayed a similar effect with the miR-615-3p mimic. In conclusion, miR-615-3p negatively regulates the osteogenic differentiation of hLF cells through post-transcriptionally suppressing osteogenic regulators GDF5 and FOXO1. It can be regarded as a potential target for human OLF therapy.",

We investigated the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in EPC differentiation and functions.Vascular endothelial growth factor caused the phosphorylation of AMPK, acetyl-coenzymeA (CoA) carboxylase (ACC), and eNOS in human cord blood-derived EPCs. The expression of EC markers, including VE-cadherin and intercellular adhesion molecule1 (ICAM-1), was also increased but blocked by Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. AICAR, an AMPK agonist, increased the phosphorylation of ACC and eNOS and the expression of EC markers in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which reinforces the positive effect of AMPK on EPC differentiation. The effects of AICAR could be blocked by treatment with L-NAME, an eNOS inhibitor. Functionally, AICAR increased but Compound C decreased the angiogenesis of EPCs in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, lovastatin promoted the activation of AMPK and eNOS, the expression of EC markers, tube formation, adhesion, and in vivo vasculogenesis of EPCs, which could be blocked by treatment with Compound C.The activation of eNOS by AMPK during EPC differentiation provides a novel mechanism for the pleiotropic effects of statins in benefiting the cardiovascular system.",

        "abstract": "Cortactin translocates to the cell periphery in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) on cortical-actin assembly in response to pulsatile shear stress. Because cortactin has putative sites for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylation, we examined the hypothesis that AMPK and SIRT1 coregulate cortactin dynamics in response to shear stress.Analysis of the ability of AMPK to phosphorylate recombinant cortactin and oligopeptides whose sequences matched AMPK consensus sequences in cortactin pointed to Thr-401 as the site of AMPK phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry confirmed Thr-401 as the site of AMPK phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis with AMPK siRNA and SIRT1 siRNA in human umbilical vein ECs and EC-specific AMPK\u03b12 knockout mice showed that AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin primes SIRT1 deacetylation in response to shear stress. Immunoblot analyses with cortactin siRNA in human umbilical vein ECs, phospho-deficient T401A and phospho-mimetic T401D mutant, or aceto-deficient (9K/R) and aceto-mimetic (9K/Q) showed that cortactin regulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity. Confocal imaging and sucrose-density gradient analyses revealed that the phosphorylated/deacetylated cortactin translocates to the EC periphery facilitating endothelial nitric oxide synthase translocation from lipid to nonlipid raft domains. Knockdown of cortactin in vitro or genetic reduction of cortactin expression in vivo in mice substantially decreased the endothelial nitric oxide synthase-derived NO bioavailability. In vivo, atherosclerotic lesions increase in ApoE(-)(/-)/cortactin(+/-) mice, when compared with ApoE(-/-)/cortactin(+/+) littermates.AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin followed by SIRT1 deacetylation modulates the interaction of cortactin and cortical-actin in response to shear stress. Functionally, this AMPK/SIRT1 coregulated cortactin-F-actin dynamics is required for endothelial nitric oxide synthase subcellular translocation/activation and is atheroprotective.",

        "abstract": "Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) plays a central role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis by controlling NO bioavailability. The activity of eNOS in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) largely depends on posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation. Because the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in ECs can be increased by multiple cardiovascular events, we studied the phosphorylation of eNOS Ser633 by AMPK and examined its functional relevance in the mouse models. Shear stress, atorvastatin, and adiponectin all increased AMPK Thr172 and eNOS Ser633 phosphorylations, which were abolished if AMPK was pharmacologically inhibited or genetically ablated. The constitutively active form of AMPK or an AMPK agonist caused a sustained Ser633 phosphorylation. Expression of gain-/loss-of-function eNOS mutants revealed that Ser633 phosphorylation is important for NO production. The aorta of AMPKalpha2(-/-) mice showed attenuated atorvastatin-induced eNOS phosphorylation. Nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) confirmed that eNOS Ser633 was able to compete with Ser1177 or acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase Ser79 for AMPKalpha phosphorylation. Nano-LC/MS/MS confirmed that eNOS purified from AICAR-treated ECs was phosphorylated at both Ser633 and Ser1177. Our results indicate that AMPK phosphorylation of eNOS Ser633 is a functional signaling event for NO bioavailability in ECs.",

        "abstract": "Urban rail transit could affect urban development in multiple aspects. Using Singapore as an example, we investigate the impact of planners\u2019 and developers\u2019 decisions on the density distribution of high-income households in areas around Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations and how these households respond to better access to urban rail transit systems. We find that the maximum density permitted by the master plan is only marginally correlated with the distances to MRT stations. Instead, the average unit size tends to be smaller, and the share of small-sized units tends to be higher in new private projects that are close to MRT stations after the new lines are in operation. This indicates that developers, who act mainly in response to the market, intentionally place more housing units in developments closer to MRT stations. Consequently, more upper- and upper-middle-class households that can afford private housing are accommodated in areas with greater accessibility to MRT. By comparing two household travel surveys before and after the opening of the Circle Line, we find that MRT did not change household demographics much in the station area, but there was an evident change in the mode share of trips made by the surveyed households, embodied by lower levels of car dependence and more reliance on MRT.",

This study investigates the impact of intra-city access to inter-city transport nodes and explores the implications of HSR station locations for the accessibility and residential property values in Chinese cities connected by bullet trains. We find that for the cities with HSR stations in suburbs, the gains in inter-city travel brought by HSR are largely offset by the prolonged intra-city travel time to reach the stations, thus limiting frequent usage of HSR for daily commuting. The inner-city HSR station in Hangzhou shows a positive impact on residential property value in the vicinity, while the suburban HSR station in Guangzhou has not been observed to raise the residential property values noticeably in the short term despite the government\u2019s intention to stimulate deve...",

        "abstract": "In industrial crystallization, a successful concentration measurement technique helps controlling the supersaturation, and thus obtaining the desired crystal size distribution will be possible. But for a two-component solution in equilibrium, a rapid concentration determination could be difficult. During the crystallization of sodium hydrogenocarbonate (sodium bicarbonate), in solution, there is an equilibrium between NaHCO 3 , Na 2 CO 3 and CO 2 . In this study, a supersaturation determination method has been devised and developed for the sodium carbonate\u2013bicarbonate system. The objective is to relate the density variation of the solution to the supersaturation of NaHCO 3 , so that the evolution of the supersaturation can be followed during the crystallization process. The method is to measure the density variation between the original solution and the solution after a desaturation or a saturation step, while minimizing the Na 2 CO 3 influence. The desaturation and saturation steps are carried out in a glass tube filled with NaHCO 3 crystals. This supersaturation determination method has been successfully applied, and the validity of the method was confirmed on NaHCO 3 saturated solutions, where the Na 2 CO 3 is controlled by CO 2 partial pressure. This methodology could be interesting not only for the study of the crystallization in two-component systems but also for solutions containing impurities.",

        "abstract": "1. Species-dependent variations in the positive inotropic effect (PIE) of endothelin-3 (ET-3), and the relationships between the PIE and specific binding sites for [125I]-ET-3 and the PIE and the acceleration of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by ET-3, were studied in ventricular muscles from the rat, guinea-pig, rabbit, ferret and dog. 2. ET-3 in the presence of (+/-)-bupranolol (0.3 microM) and prazosin (0.3 microM) elicited a concentration-dependent PIE in the ventricular muscle from the rat, guinea-pig, rabbit and ferret. The potency of ET-3 and its efficacy in inducing a PIE were highest in the rabbit, intermediate in the rat and guinea-pig and lowest in the ferret. ET-3 did not have any inotropic effect on ventricular muscle from the dog. 3. Specific high-affinity binding of [125I]-ET-3 was observed with membrane fractions derived from the ventricular muscle of the five species. The maximal specific binding (Bmax) of ET-3 was highest in the rat and guinea-pig, intermediate in the rabbit and ferret and lowest in the dog. The values of KD in the rabbit and dog (33 and 52 pM) were lower than those in the rat, guinea-pig and ferret (141-221 pM). 4. In slices of ventricular muscle from all five species, ET-3 increased the accumulation of [3H]-inositol monophosphate (IP1) in a concentration-dependent manner. The extent of accumulation of IP1 was highest in the rat, intermediate in the guinea-pig and rabbit and lowest in the ferret and dog. 5. The results demonstrate the wide range of variations in the PIE of ET-3 on mammalian ventricular muscles. The variations in the coupling processes subsequent to the acceleration of the hydrolysis of PI, triggered by the binding of ET-3 to its receptor, might be important in these species-dependent differences in the PIE of ET-3.",

        "abstract": "In isolated rabbit right atria, endothelin (ET) isopeptides ET-1 and ET-3 elicited a concentration-dependent negative chronotropic effect (NCE) in the presence of isoproterenol (Iso): ET-1 was approximately 10 times more potent than ET-3. The NCE of ET-1 was abolished by the ETA- and ETB-receptor antagonist TAK-044 (1 microM) or the ETA-receptor antagonist BQ-123 (10 microM), but it was not affected by the ETB-receptor antagonist RES-701-1 or BQ-788. ET-1 decreased the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) level in the presence of Iso in rabbit atria. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) markedly attenuated the NCE of ET-1 and abolished the decrease in the cAMP level induced by ET-1. In isolated dog ventricular trabeculae, ET-1 elicited a pronounced negative inotropic effect (NIE), whereas ET-3 induced a small but significant positive inotropic effect in the presence of Iso. The NIE was abolished by the ETA-receptor antagonist BQ-123 (1 microM) and partially attenuated by the ETB-receptor antagonist RES-701-1. The positive inotropic effect of ET-3 was abolished by RES-701-1. Although pretreatment with PTX markedly attenuated the NIE of ET-1, cAMP levels in dog ventricular muscle were not decreased by ET-1. These results indicate that activation of an ETA receptor that is coupled to the PTX-sensitive G protein plays a dominant role in the NCE and NIE of ET-1. The NCE of ET-1 may, in part, be due to a decrease in cAMP level. By contrast, the NIE of ET-1 does not involve an alteration of cAMP accumulation. The present findings imply that ET isopeptides might antagonize the cardiostimulatory action of catecholamines mediated by beta-adrenoceptors when the blood level of both endogenous regulators are increased under cardiovascular pathophysiological situations.",

The thermosensitive particles were used as packing materials of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for separating naphthalin derivatives. The results revealed that satisfactory separation was attained by controlling temperature of the column. As a comparison the packing material of silica-MPT has no such separating efficiency due to absence of thermosensitivety. The mechanism for the temperature- controlled separation is attributed to the polarity change of the PNIPAM on silica surface when PNIPAM undergoes volume phase transition.",

Maintaining the preliminary progenitor phenotype and good proliferation capacity of EPCs is key to their use in treating cardiovascular ischemic diseases. However, transcriptional regulation in EPCs remains largely unknown. We investigated the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) combined with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on EPCs and the potential roles of Kr\u00fcppel-like transcription factors (KLFs).Co-treatment with LIF and VEGF (100 ng/ml each) (V+L) could increase EPC colony-forming units and CD34 expression, which reflects the EPC progenitor phenotype and alleviated differentiation of EPCs. The effect was associated with Akt activation and increased expression of KLF4. Upregulation of KLF4 induced by V+L could be inhibited by transfection with dominant-negative Akt adenovirus. Furthermore, overexpression of KLF4 in EPCs enhanced the expression of CD34 and alleviated cell differentiation but did not increase the phosphorylation of Akt.LIF combined with VEGF can maintain the preliminary, progenitor phenotype of EPCs and alleviate cell differentiation by upregulating KLF4, which may provide new insights into transcriptional regulation in EPCs.",

However, the effect of LXR agonists on endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function is largely unknown. Here, we explored the effect of the LXR agonist TO901317 (TO) on EPC biology and the underlying mechanisms.Endothelial progenitor cells were cultured in mannitol or 30 mm glucose (high glucose) for 24 hours. For TO treatments, cells were pretreated with TO (10 \u03bcm) for 12 hours, then mannitol or high glucose was added for an additional 24 hours. EPCs function, reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, and phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were analyzed.TO could restore the high glucose-impaired adhesion and migration capacity of EPCs. High glucose impaired EPC-mediated angiogenesis, and TO reversed the impairment. TO also alleviated ROS release induced by high glucose. Western blot analysis revealed that high glucose downregulated the phosphorylation of AMPK and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, which could be reversed with TO treatment. Furthermore, inhibiting AMPK activation by compound C could abolish the protective effects of TO on EPCs.TO had a protective effect on EPCs under high glucose by inhibiting ROS release and activating AMPK.",

        "abstract": "Moxibustion is one of the most commonly used therapies in acupuncture practice, and is demonstrated to be beneficial for patients with diarrhea from irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). But its mechanism remains unclear. Because visceral hypersensitivity in IBS patients has been documented by evaluation of perceived stimulations through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, we focused on observing brain imaging changes in D-IBS patients during rectal balloon distention before and after moxibustion in order to reveal its possible central mechanism and further evaluate its effect.This clinical trial is registered under the number: ChiCTR-TRC-10000887. Eighty D-IBS patients were randomly divided into a moxibustion and sham moxibustion group (control group) for a 4-week treatment. Fifteen patients in moxibustion group and thirteen patients in control group completed two fMRI scans during a 50 and 100 ml rectal balloon distention before and after treatment. Rectal pain were obtained with a scan test. Birmingham IBS Symptom Scale and IBS Quality of Life (QOL) Scale were used to evaluate therapeutic effect.After treatment, the decrease in Birmingham IBS Symptom Scale and IBS QOL Scale scores in moxibustion group was significantly greater than that of control group (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The defecation urge threshold and the pain perception threshold of moxibustion group was also significantly higher after treatment than that of control group (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The decrease in pain score during the 100 ml rectal balloon distention in moxibustion group was significantly greater than that of control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). There was no definite activated center during the 50 ml rectal distention in either group before treatment. After treatment, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was affected in moxibustion group, while the PFC and the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) were affected in control group. During the 100 ml distention before treatment in both groups, the PFC and ACC were activated. After treatment, they disappeared in moxibustion group but remained in control group.Moxibustion can improve symptoms and quality of life in D-IBS patients. It can also decrease rectal sensitivity. The activation of PFC and ACC during a 100 ml rectal distention disappeared after moxibustion treatment.",

The different binding images show that vincrinstine sulfate binding DNA chains caused some loops and cleavages of the DNA fragments, whereas aspirin interaction caused the width changes and conformational transition of the DNA fragments. Two different DNA structural alternations could be explained by the different mechanisms of the interactions with these two components. Our work indicates that the AFM is a powerful tool in studying the interaction between DNA and small molecules.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel method for fabricating unimole cular double-stranded DNA microarrays on solid surfaces, which were used to probe sequence-specific DNA/protein interactions. For manufacturing the unimolecular double-stranded DNA microarrays, two kinds of special single-stranded oligonucleotides, constan t oligonucleotid e and target oligonucleotide, were chemically synthesized. The constant oligonucleotides with internal aminated dT were used to capture and immobilize the target oligonucleotides onto the solid surface, and also to provide a primer for later enzymatic extension reactions, while target oligonucleotides took the role of harbouring DNA-binding sites of DNA-binding proteins. The variant target oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated with the constant oligonucleotides to form the new unimolecular oligonucleotides for microspotting. The prepared unimolecular oligonucleotides were microspotted on aldehyde -derivatized glass slides to make partial-dsDNA microarrays. Finally, the partial-dsDNA microarrays were converted into a unimolecular complete-dsDNA microarray by a DNA polymerase extension reaction. The efficiency and accuracy of the polymerase synthesis were demonstrated by the fluorescent-labeled dUTP incorporation in the enzymatic extension reaction and the restriction endonuclease digestion of the fabricated unimolecular complete-dsDNA microarray. The accessibility and specificity of the sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins binding to the immobilized unimolecular dsDNA probes were demonstrated by the binding of Cy3 labeled NF-?B (p50\u00b7p50) to the unimolecular dsDNA microarray. This unimolecular dsDNA microarray provides a general technique for high-throughput DNA-protein or DNA-drugs interactions.",

We directly applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate linear pBR322-EcoR1 methylase complexes and quantitatively analyzed the bend angles of linear pBR322-EcoR1 methylase complexes and the bound protein widths. In this study, we made a novel observation that DNA-EcoR1 methylase complexes exhibited two populations of conformation at recognition site: DNA bent an acute angle at the recognition site in the presence of one EcoR1 methylase monomeric molecule, while DNA bent an unacute angle at the recognition site and the complementary site on duplex DNAs in the presence of EcoR1 methylase dimer. The data indicated that the unacute angle state was the result of unique interactions between EcoR1 methylase and the recognition site and the complementary site on duplex DNAs, and suggested that the acute angle conformation could be an intermediate in the formation of the unacute angle state. Our works provide a detail insight into the DNA structural variations involved in EcoR1 methylase-binding processes and demonstrate further the versatility of AFM as an imaging technique for studying the interaction between large DNA fragment and protein.",

An atomic force microscope and a surface potential meter were used to characterize morphologies and electric polarization of these surfaces. It was found that surface electric polarization and the its durability and surface topography were key factors to cell adhesion. Collagen (1 mg/mL) grafted on 1% chitosan-modified surface showed the best adhesion of HeLa cell. This work might be helpful to the practical application of cell microarray chips.",

Deformations can result in the merging and disappearance of the Dirac points, and the originally intersecting dispersion relation branches separate. Corresponding to these deformations, nonlinear envelope equations are derived and their dynamics are studied. In the region where Dirac points exist,a maximally balanced equation is derived which has limits to a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger-Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (NLSKP)-type equation and its dispersionless reduction. When the Dirac points disappear and a gap opens, a different maximally balanced equation is derived which has the NLSKP equation and a one-dimensional nonlocal evolution equation as limits. When the gap is sufficiently wide, a nonlinear Dirac equation with nonzero mass and a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger focusing-defocusing system are found. The latter two equations admit nonlinear localized modes. Typical dynamical behaviors of the effective envelope equations are presented. Copyright \u00a9 by SIAM.",

A discrete approximation, known as the tight-binding (TB) approximation, is employed to find the equations governing a class of nonlinear discrete envelopes in simple 2-D periodic lattices. Instead of using Wannier function analysis, the orbital approximation of Bloch modes that has been widely used in the physical literature, is employed. With this approximation the Bloch envelope dynamics associated with both simple and degenerate bands are readily studied. The governing equations are found to be discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger (NLS)-type equations or coupled NLS-type systems. The coefficients of the linear part of the equations are related to the linear dispersion relation. When the envelopes vary slowly, the continuous limit of the general discrete NLS equations are effective NLS equations in moving frames. These continuous NLS equations (from discrete to continuous) also agree with those derived via a direct multiscale expansion. Rectangular and triangular lattices are examples. \u00a9 2012 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",

It is first shown that these interactions exhibit similar fractal dependence on initial conditions for different nonlinearities. Then by using the Karpman-Solov'ev method, a universal system of dynamical equations is derived for the velocities, amplitudes, positions, and phases of interacting solitary waves. These dynamical equations contain a single parameter, which accounts for the different forms of nonlinearity. When this parameter is zero, these dynamical equations are integrable, and the exact analytical solutions are derived. When this parameter is nonzero, the dynamical equations exhibit fractal structures which match those in the original wave equations both qualitatively and quantitatively. Thus the universal nature of fractal structures in the weak interaction of solitary waves is analytically established. The origin of these fractal structures is also explored. It is shown that these structures bifurcate from the initial conditions where the solutions of the integrable dynamical equations develop finite-time singularities. Based on this observation, an analytical criterion for the existence and locations of fractal structures is obtained.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Purpose  This study introduces an updated Three-Column Concept for the classification and treatment of complex tibial plateau fractures. A combined preoperative assessment of fracture morphology and injury mechanism is utilized to determine surgical approach, implant placement and fixation sequence. The effectiveness of this updated concept is demonstrated through evaluation of both clinical and radiographic outcome measures.    Patients and methods  From 2008 to 2012, 355 tibial plateau fractures were treated using the updated Three-Column Concept. Standard radiographic and computed tomography imaging are used to systematically assess and classify fracture patterns as follows: (1) identify column(s) injured and locate associated articular depression or comminution, (2) determine injury mechanism including varus/valgus and flexion/extension forces, and (3) determine surgical approach(es) as well as the location and function of applied fixation. Quality and maintenance of reduction and alignment, fracture healing, complications, and functional outcomes were assessed.    Results  287 treated fractures were followed up for a mean period of 44.5 months (range: 22\u201396). The mean time to radiographic bony union and full weight-bearing was 13.5 weeks (range: 10\u201328) and 14.8 weeks (range: 10\u201326) respectively. The average functional Knee Society Score was 93.0 (range: 80\u201395). The average range of motion of the affected knees was 1.5\u2013121.5\u00b0. No significant difference was found in knee alignment between immediate and 18-month post-operative measurements. Additionally, no significant difference was found in functional scores and range of motion between one, two and three-column fracture groups. Twelve patients suffered superficial infection, one had limited skin necrosis and two had wound dehiscence, that healed with nonoperative management. Intraoperative vascular injury occurred in two patients. Fixation of failure was not observed in any of the fractures treated.    Conclusion  An updated Three-Column Concept assessing fracture morphology and injury mechanism in tandem can be used to guide surgical treatment of tibial plateau fractures. Limited results demonstrate successful application of biologically friendly fixation constructs while avoiding fixation failure and associated complications of both simple and complex tibial plateau fractures.    Level of evidence  Level II, prospective cohort study.",

        "abstract": "To compare the Sliding with Non-sliding lag screw of a gamma nail in the treatment of A1 and A2 AO-OTA intertrochanteric fractures.80 patients were prospectively collected. In each group, AO/OTA 31-A were classified into group A. AO/OTA 31-A2.1 was classified as group B. We classified the A2.2 and A2.3 as group C. According to the set-screw locking formation of Gamma-III, the cases were randomly allocated to Sliding subgroup and Non-sliding subgroup in A, B and C groups. Follow-ups were performed 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively.In the Sliding group, the bone healing rate 3, 6, 12 months postoperatively reached 85.00%, 97.50%, 100% in group A, B and C. Meanwhile, in Non-sliding group, postoperatively, bone healing rate were 90.00%, 95.00% and 97.50% in group A, B and C, respectively. Both differences were not significant. Lower limb discrepancy between Sliding and Non-sliding pattern was significantly different in group C which represent fracture types of AO/OTA 31-A2.2 and A2.3 (0.573 \u00b1 0.019 mm in Non-sliding group, 0.955 mm \u00b1 0.024 mm in Sliding group, P < 0.001 ). Difference of sliding distance among the three groups was significant among group A, B and C: 0.48 mm \u00b1 0.04 mm, 0.62 mm \u00b1 0.07 mm and 0.92 mm \u00b1 0.04 mm (P < 0.001). Differences in average healing time and Harris scores also presented no significance in the three groups.As a result, we can conclude that the sliding distance is minimal in Gamma nails and it is related to the comminuted extent of the intertrochanteric area in A1 and A2 AO-OTA intertrochanteric fractures. For treating these kinds of fractures, the sliding of the lag screw of an Gamma nail does not improve any clinical results and in certain cases, such as highly comminuted A1 and A2 fractures, can therefore even benefit from a locked lag screw by tightening the set-screw.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of various processing parameters on apple slices exposed to infrared (IR) radiation heating in a continuous heating mode for achieving simultaneous infrared dry-blanching and dehydration (SIRDBD). The investigated parameters were radiation intensity, slice thickness and processing time. A three-factor factorial experiment design was conducted to determine the influence of parameters on the heating and drying rates, product temperature, moisture reduction, residual polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities and surface color change (\u0394 E ). High radiation intensity and/or thin slices had faster increase of product temperature, and quicker moisture removal and inactivation of PPO and POD, than did low radiation intensity and/or thick slices. The simple page model performed well for describing drying behavior during SIRDBD. The first-order kinetics and the fractional conversion models fitted well for PPO and POD inactivation curves, respectively. Surface color changes of apple slices were mainly due to the decrease of L value and increase of a value, which corresponded to enzymatic browning occurred during the process. To achieve 1 log reduction of POD, the SIRDBD treatments resulted in moisture reductions of 15.35\u201349.29% and \u0394 E between 2.030 and 5.518. It has been concluded that SIRDBD with continuous heating could be used as an alternative to the current processing methods for producing high-quality blanched and partially dehydrated fruits and vegetables.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of three processing parameters, e.g. product surface temperature, slice thickness and processing time, on blanching and dehydration characteristics of apple slices exposed to simultaneous infrared dry-blanching and dehydration (SIRDBD) with intermittent heating. A three-factor factorial experiment design was conducted to determine the influence of processing parameters on product temperature, moisture reduction, drying rate, residual polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities and surface color change. Slice thickness had a significant effect on product quality and processing characteristics, as faster inactivation of enzymes and quicker moisture reduction took place in thinner slices. A Page model performed well for describing drying behavior during the treatment, and first-order kinetics and a biphasic model fit well for PPO and POD inactivation, respectively. Surface color changes (\u0394 E ) of apple slices during prolonged heating resulted from non-enzymatic browning with an increase in b value was observed. In order to achieve a 1 log reduction in POD activity, the process resulted in a reduction in moisture from 20% to 59% and in \u0394 E from 2.27 to 5.59. It is suggested that SIRDBD with intermittent heating could be used as an alternative to manufacture high quality blanched and partially dehydrated fruits and vegetables.",

The model is used to solve the Taylor dispersion problem and explore the characterization of dispersion as an asymptotic Fickian process. Discrete SPH particle data are analyzed using the method of moments. Simulations for pure tracer convection are used to calculate values of tortuosity and effective porosity for two-dimensional spatially periodic porous media. Tracer convection through such media cannot be described as an asymptotic Fickian-type process, even for large times, if the driving body force F is parallel to a line of media symmetry. If F is not parallel to a line of media symmetry, Fickian-type mixing is possible for tracer convection. An asymptotic Fickian approximation is valid for tracer dispersion through two-dimensional spatially periodic porous media when diffusion effects are included.",

        "abstract": "We investigate an innovative and efficacious procedure for restoring wrist flexion, finger flexion, and hand sensation by passing the contralateral C7 through a subcutaneous tunnel across the anterior surface of the chest and neck.Four patients (3 men, 1 woman) with total brachial plexus avulsion were treated from November 2005 to July 2007, their ages ranging from 18 to 36 years (average, 26 years). The operative delay was from 23 days to 5 months (mean, 2 months). The contralateral C7 nerve root was employed to repair the injured lower trunk or the C8-T1 spinal nerves via the subcutaneous tunnel across the anterior surface of the chest and neck. Direct neurorrhaphy was performed on the C8-T1 residual nerve roots in 2 patients. In the other 2 patients, a nerve graft of 4.5 cm in length was used to restore function of the affected lower trunk.Postoperative electromyography at 26 and 38 months recorded compound muscle action potentials and motor unit potentials in the abductor digiti minimi and the flexor pollicis longus in all cases. On clinical examination digital flexion scored M1-M3, carpal flexion M2-M4, and hand sensation S1-S3.Transfer of the contralateral C7 to the lower trunk proved to be a safe and feasible procedure. Compared with the traditional transfer of the contralateral C7 to the median nerve, it might help patients gain better restoration of wrist flexion, finger flexion, and hand sensation.",

But it is not clarified yet if the function of trapezius will be interfered with and when the newborn potentials of supraspinatus and infraspinatus appear after the transferring procedure. Objective: To investigate the pre-and postoperative electrophysiological changes of the different sites of trapezius and its effect on the function of trapezius of the patients with brachial plexus injury whose accessory nerves were sectioned at the infraclavicular level and transferred to suprascapular nerves during operation. Design: An auto-control retrospective study was performed according to the diagnosis. Setting and participants: The experiment was carried out in the Department of Hand Surgery of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University. During January, 1996 and February, 2000, the accessory nerves of patients with brachial plexus injury were transferred to suprascapular nerves, and 17 men and 3 women of these patients with full data, aged 11 to 46 years, with a mean age of 29 years old were selected as the subjects. Methods: The accessory nerve of these 20 patients was sectioned at infraclavicular level and transferred to suprascapular nerve 3 to 6 months after injury. PHASIS was used for electrophysiological examination. The stimulating electrode was placed over the surface of sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the record was made at the upper, middle and lower part of trapezius muscle and sternocleidomastoid muscle. The dynamic EMG and functional following-up were carried out at the supraspinatus and infraspinatus postoperatively. Main Outcome Measurements: The testing of muscle strength before and after operation was performed, and the amplitude values of action potential of the upper, middle and lower part of trapezius muscle, and the abduction of affected extremity were measured. Results: Sectioning and transferring of accessory nerve at infraclavicular level disturbed the function of the lower part of trapezius muscle obviously, while there was no significant effect on the upper and middle parts. The neural regeneration action potential of supraspinatus of 83.8% patients was detected 5-9 months after operation. All the patients in this group regained their function of shoulder abduction 2-3 years later. Conclusion: Sectioning accessory nerve at the infraclavicular level would interfere with the function of the lower part of trapezius muscle. If sternocleidomastoid muscle possesses good function, the proximal accessory nerve close to the branch innervating the sternocleidomastoid muscle can still be selected as a donor nerve in spite of the severe paralysis of trapezius muscle.",

        "abstract": "This report describes the use of a novel sensitive and specific ELISA for the measurement of human fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2/fibroleukin), a novel effector of natural regulatory T (Treg) cells, to predict the course of chronic hepatitis C viral infection (HCV).Plasma levels of FGL2 were measured in HCV patients and compared to healthy controls and to patients with alcoholic liver disease.FGL2 levels were significantly higher in HCV patients (84.3+/-89.1 ng/ml, n=80) compared to healthy controls (36.4+/-21.9 ng/ml, n=30, p<0.001), to a subset of patients who cleared HCV following anti-viral treatment (16.6+/-19.7 ng/ml, n=32, p<0.001), and to patients with inactive alcoholic liver disease (18.8+/-17.4 ng/ml, n=24, p<0.001). Among HCV patients, plasma levels of FGL2 correlated significantly with the stage of fibrosis (p=0.001) and were significantly higher in patients with cirrhosis (164.1+121.8 ng/ml, n=60) compared to non-cirrhotics (57.7+/-52.8 ng/ml, n=20, p=0.001). Genotype 1 patients had significantly higher levels of FGL2 (98.1+/-100.3 ng/ml, n=60) compared to patients with genotype 2/3 (41.5+/-38.6 ng/ml, n=20, p=0.0008). Patients with genotype 2/3 had FGL2 levels similar to healthy controls (41.5+/-38.6 vs. 36.41+/-21.9 ng/ml, p=ns). Infiltrating lymphocytes in liver biopsies of HCV patients were positive for either FGL2 or FoxP3 (a marker of Treg cells) or expressed both markers.This report documents the development of a sensitive ELISA for measurement of plasma levels of FGL2 an effector Treg cells, which correlates with the severity of HCV infection.",

        "abstract": "Fulminant viral hepatitis (FH) remains an important clinical problem in which the underlying pathogenesis is not well understood. Here, we present insight into the immunological mechanisms involved in FH caused by murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3), indicating a critical role for CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and production of the novel Treg effector molecule FGL2. Before infection with MHV-3, susceptible BALB/cJ mice had increased numbers of Tregs and expression of fgl2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and FGL2 protein compared with resistant A/J mice. After MHV-3 infection, plasma levels of FGL2 in BALB/cJ mice were significantly increased, correlating with increased percentage of Tregs. Treatment with anti-FGL2 antibody completely inhibited Treg activity and protected susceptible BALB/cJ mice against MHV-3-liver injury and mortality. Adoptive transfer of wild-type Tregs into resistant fgl2(-/-) mice increased their mortality caused by MHV-3 infection, whereas transfer of peritoneal exudate macrophages had no adverse effect.This study demonstrates that FGL2 is an important effector cytokine of Tregs that contributes to susceptibility to MHV-3-induced FH. The results further suggest that targeting FGL2 may lead to the development of novel treatment approaches for acute viral hepatitis infection.",

This paper proposes a novel cooperative scheme called Cooperative Binary Relaying and Combining (CBRC) for multi-hop wireless networking systems where the nodes cooperatively demodulate high-order modulated signal symbols with low-order robust modulations. Low-order demodulation schemes make partial decision at each relay node and avoid propagating the errors that can result from high-order demodulation schemes in conventional cooperative relaying. Therefore, CBRC supports high bit rate transmission at high-order modulations over low SNR links. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the bit error rate performance of CBRC and conventional cooperative strategies. The results show that CBRC can significantly improve the performance.",

        "abstract": "This work analytically investigates the wireless channel characteristics at 60 GHz in five aspects: path loss on the range of a wireless communication system, multi-path fading, spatial diversity, high peak-to-average power ratio of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), and detection time of clear channel assessment. The analysis is conducted in comparison to the 2.4 GHz system. The observations are summarized as follows: the 60 GHz system experiences large path losses and can support only short range communications, approximately half of that at 2.4 GHz. However, it suffers lightly from multi-path fading due to its small average fade duration. Because of the short wave length, the 60 GHz communication can support packing a large number of antennas at a transceiver to exploit spatial diversity that can significantly boost the transmit or receive gains. One problem of 60 GHz in using OFDM to avoid frequency selective fading on its wide bandwidth is high peak-to-average power ratio that increases the cost and complexity in implementing transceivers. Due to its wide bandwidth that hints to high symbol rate, the 60 GHz system can achieve a fast detection of signals in carrier sense.",

Plant height was measured after anthesis, but phytomer number and tiller density were investigated at harvest. One single autumn harvest was carried out each year and biomass yields were determined. It was found that the lowland cultivars \u2018Alamo\u2019, \u2018Kanlow\u2019 and \u2018NewYork\u2019 produced the most biomass for their better performances in number of phytomers per tiller and mass per phytomer, though upland cultivars had higher tiller density. \u2018Cave-in-rock\u2019 and \u2018Trailblazer\u2019 had better biomass production among the upland cultivars and they were also recommended for planting together with lowland ones for their excellent cold tolerance in this region.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Polyploidization is regularly regarded as an important tool for the generation of innovative germplasm resources and plant breeding. In this study, autopolyploid switchgrass lines were produced from calli derived from immature inflorescence of tetraploid switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum  L.), both lowland cv. Alamo and Kanlow, and upland cv. Ranlow, through colchicine treatments. Ploidy levels of plantlets regenerated from the calli were screened by flow cytometry. Growth characteristics of the tetraploid and octoploid switchgrass cultivars were further investigated in a field experiment. Compared with the tetraploid plants of the three switchgrass cultivars, the corresponding octoploid plants showed significant reduction in plant height, number of tillers per plant and fresh matter, but an increase in leaf length and width.",
