This approach facilitates reagent-saving and simplification of the device fabrication. Amphiphobic modification of the separator surface enables us to handle the device easily without liquid spill, and assists bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) formation. Furthermore, we found that pretreatment of lipid deposition on the separator increased the success rate of BLM formation. We are assured of this methodu0027s availability for various research and development fields based on DIB applications.",

        "abstract": "Using Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) that exhibits hypertension, obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, the role of local angiotensin II in cardiovascular complications at early stages of NIDDM was characterized. OLETF rats were given an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle from the age of 5 weeks to 20 weeks. Arteriolar, intermediate and venular capillary proportions were determined by the double-staining method and levels of collagen and non-collagenous proteins were determined by the selective dye-binding method in heart tissues. In OLETF rats at 20 weeks of age, capillary network remodeling (i.e., an increase in arteriolar portions and a decrease in venular portions) and an increase in collagen content were detected. Cilazapril not only exerted favorable effects on markers of diabetes, but also prevented capillary network remodeling and ameliorated the increase in collagen content. These results suggest that 1) capillary network remodeling and increase in extracellular matrix protein levels precede the onset of overt NIDDM in OLETF rats, and 2) angiotensin II may be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac complications in the early stages of NIDDM.",

Replacement of the bone fragments mixed with fibrin glue enables tamponade against the dura to be achieved without a fat graft.Computed tomographic scans and plain cranial films taken a few years later showed successful reconstruction of the mastoid bone with a good appearance of the retromastoid area in seven patients who underwent this procedure. The only complication was infection in one patient from cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the wound.We have developed a simple and easy technique of cosmetic reconstruction after the transpetrosal-presigmoid approach.",

        "abstract": "Hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass alters platelet function and hypothermia is associated with postoperative myocardial ischemia. Thrombogenic surfaces such as extracorporeal circuits, vascular graft materials, and components of atherosclerotic plaque induce activation of platelets. The effects of human hemoglobin (Hb) covalently modified to carry S-nitric oxide (NO) functional groups (SNO-Hb), polyethylene glycol (PEG-Hb), and SNO-PEG-Hb on platelet activation were studied. Platelet activation was assessed by cytometric analysis of GPIIb-IIIa activation and P-selectin expression at hypothermic condition (22 degrees C) after stimulation with Hb derivatives. Platelet adhesion and aggregation were measured in a parallel glass plate chamber coated with unmodified Hb, SNO-Hb, PEG-Hb, SNO-PEG-Hb, and collagen. Platelet binding of antibodies to GPIIb-IIIa and P-selectin was significantly enhanced by hypothermic condition and by unmodified Hb. There was significantly less platelet binding of antibodies to GPIIb-IIIa and P-selectin with SNO-Hb, PEG-Hb, and SNO-PEG-Hb compared with unmodified Hb. There was significantly less platelet attachment, adhesion, and aggregation on the SNO-Hb, PEG-Hb and SNO-PEG-Hb coated surfaces compared with unmodified Hb-coated and -uncoated surfaces. SNO-Hb, PEG-Hb, and SNO-PEG-Hb induced less platelet activation at hypothermic temperature, and induced less platelet adhesion and aggregation on thrombogenic surfaces compared with unmodified Hb. The inhibitory effect may be derived from antiadhesive properties of Hb, antiplatelet actions of NO, and molecular barrier action of PEG.",

        "abstract": "Tumor regression grade of the primary tumor (TRG-PT) and residual lymph node metastasis have been pathologically determined in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) followed by surgery; however, TRG of the metastatic tumor involving lymph nodes (LNs) has not yet been determined. The aim of this study was to clarify the impact of TRG on the ESCC patients' prognosis. ESCC patients (n=110) who had received nCT followed by surgery were enrolled. Dissected LNs were classified into two categories: plausible positive metastatic LNs (pp-MLNs) where viable and/or degenerated ESCC cells and/or tissue modifications were observed, and non-metastatic LNs (non-MLNs) where neither of them was observed. We defined nCT-effective rate (CER) as the ratio of the number of pp-MLNs that showed tumor regression to the total number of pp-MLNs, and divided CER into low-CER (LCER; >0 and <50%) and high-CER (HCER; >50 and <100%). Relationships between CER and clinicopathological factors including prognosis were then examined. In result, multivariate analyses of 110 patients demonstrated that ypT3-4 (P = 0.023, HR; 2.551), positive venous infiltration (P = 0.006, HR; 3.526), and LCER (P = 0.033, HR; 1.922) were independently associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS). Multivariate analyses of 43 patients with grade 0 TRG-PT showed that ypT3-4 (P = 0.033, HR 3.397) and LCER (P = 0.008, HR 3,543) were independently associated with shorter RFS. This study demonstrated that CER was one of the prognostic factors for ESCC patients who had received nCT followed by surgery. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "We examined the effects of temperature on excitatory synaptic transmission and the recurrent inhibitory loop in CA1 neurons in guinea pig hippocampal slices. Increasing the temperature of the perfusing medium from 30 to 49 degrees C resulted in attenuation of both the amplitude of the synaptically evoked CA1 population spikes and the paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the spikes. A bath application of 2 microM picrotoxin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist, did not affect the amplitude of the CA1 population spikes, but it significantly reduced PPI during the early heating phase (30-32 degrees C). In contrast, the application of 1 mM theophylline or 50 microM 8-phenyltheophylline, a selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, resulted in significant augmentation of the PPI during the early phase of hyperthermia (30-34 degrees C) and a significant increase in the amplitude of the CA1 population spikes at higher temperatures (34-43 degrees C). These results suggest that increased activation of adenosine A1 receptors in response to a temperature increase depresses not only excitatory synaptic responses, but also the strength of the inhibitory circuit in CA1 neurons. Furthermore, hyperexcitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons was seen in the middle of the heating range (34-38 degrees C), excitatory responses still being present, but the strength of the inhibitory circuit significantly reduced.",

        "abstract": "Comprehensive evaluation of endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vascular functions in peripheral arteries and coronary arteries in smokers has never been performed previously. Through the use of brachial artery ultrasound and oxygen-15-labeled water positron emission tomography (PET), we sought to investigate peripheral and coronary vascular dysfunctions in smokers.Eight smokers and 10 healthy individuals underwent brachial artery ultrasound at rest, during reactive hyperemia [250mmHg cuff occlusion (flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)], and following sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was assessed through O-15-labeled water PET at rest, during adenosine triphosphate (ATP) administration, and during a cold pressor test (CPT). Through ultrasound, smokers were shown to have significantly reduced %FMD compared to controls (6.62±2.28% vs. 11.29±2.75%, p=0.0014). As assessed by O-15-labeled water PET, smokers were shown to have a significantly lower CPT response than were controls (21.1±9.5% vs. 50.9±16.9%, p=0.0004). There was no relationship between %FMD and CPT response (r=0.40, p=0.097). Endothelium-independent vascular dilatation was similar for both groups in terms of coronary flow reserve with PET (p=0.19). Smokers tended to have lower %NTG in the brachial artery (p=0.055).Smokers exhibited impaired coronary endothelial function as well as peripheral brachial artery endothelial function. In addition, there was no correlation between PET and ultrasound measurements, possibly implying that while smokers may have systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction, the characteristics of that dysfunction may be different in peripheral arteries and coronary arteries.",

        "abstract": "We studied the synaptic plasticity of hippocampal CA1 neurons and spatial learning behavior in gerbils that had been loaded with a transient cerebral ischemia caused by 5 min or 10 min occlusion of the bilateral carotid arteries. The stimulus threshold to elicit the field responses after a transient cerebral ischemia was not different from that in controls, but there was a significant decrease in the magnitude of synaptic responses, which might result from the observed loss of neurons. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation after a 10 min cerebral ischemia expressed as a percentage of the pre-tetanus or pre-low frequency stimulation value were almost the same as those in controls, although the actual magnitude of the LTP and depotentiation was lower than in controls. Gerbils that were loaded with a 10 min cerebral ischemia showed impairment in a spatial learning test when this was started 10 days after the cerebral ischemia, but not when it was started 20 days after the same cerebral ischemia. These results suggest that the changes in electrophysiological properties of hippocampal CA1 neurons seen at 10 days after a 10 min cerebral ischemia contribute to the impairment of spatial learning of gerbils seen at this time, and that the extra-CA1 regions might be involved in the recovery of spatial learning seen at 20 days after cerebral ischemia.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) was studied pharmacologically using guinea pig hippocampal slices. Application of 10 microM ATP for 10 min transiently depressed, then slowly augmented, synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons, leading to LTP. This ATP-induced LTP was blocked by addition of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist. Furthermore, co-application of 10 microM ATP and 100 microM L-glutamate for 10 min also induced LTP, and this effect was blocked by the use of Ca2+-free solution during drug application. These results suggest that, in CA1 neurons, a co-operative effect involving extracellular ATP and the activation of NMDA receptors, which increases intracellular Ca2+ levels, is required to trigger the intracellular biological process involved in ATP-induced LTP.",

Anion exchange resins can reduce plasma LDL levels and affect LDL particle size via increasing triglycerides. In the present study, the effects of short-term colestimide administration on LDL particle size were investigated.Obese patients with primary hyperlipidemia (n=21) were administered 3000 mg/day of colestimide for 1 month and fasting blood was obtained before and after the treatment. LDL particle size and number were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lipoprofile using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Levels of plasma LDL cholesterol decreased from 155.5 mg/dl to 128.1 mg/dl (p<0.001) and levels of apolipoprotein B decreased from 139.2 mg/dl to 120.6 mg/dl (p<0.001) by colestimide administration. Levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglyceride were unaltered. LDL particle size did not change, whereas LDL particle numbers decreased from 1920.3 nmol/l to 1568.8 nmol/l (p<0.01).Short-term administration of colestimide to patients with hyperlipidemia reduced LDL particle numbers. LDL particle size was not changed.",

        "abstract": "Ion channels are located in plasma membranes as well as on mitochondrial, lysosomal, and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. They play a critical role in physiology and drug targeting. It is particularly challenging to measure the current mediated by ion channels in the lysosomal and the endoplasmic reticulum membranes using the conventional patch clamp method. In this study, we show that our proposed device is applicable for an electrophysiological measurement of various types of ion channel in plasma and organelle membranes. We designed an on-chip device that can form multiple electrical contacts with a measurement system when placed on a mount system. Using crude cell membranes containing ion channels extracted from cultured cells without detergents, we detected open/close signals of the hERG, TRPV1, and NMDA channels on plasma membranes, those of the TRPML1 channels on lysosomal membranes, and open/close signals of the RyR channels on SR membranes. This method will provide a highly versatile drug screening system for ion channels expressed by various cell membranes, including plasma, SR, mitochondrial, Golgi, and lysosomal membranes.",

        "abstract": "Electromagnetic and heat-transfer simulations were used to study the effects of microwave-generated nonuniform temperature distributions in a catalyst bed on the rate enhancement of a fixed-bed flow reaction. We used the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a magnetite catalyst as a model reaction. During the microwave reaction, a temperature gradient was generated in the catalyst bed; the highest temperature occurred at the core of the catalyst bed, and it parabolically decreased toward the surface. Using these simulation results and Arrhenius parameters, the reaction rates were estimated by considering the nonuniform temperature distribution. The measured reaction rate was 36% larger than the simulated value, indicating that the rate enhancement under microwaves can not only be attributed to the nonuniform temperature distribution in the catalyst bed. This could be due to nonequilibrium local heating (the so-called hot spot) in the very small region around the catalyst particle.",

        "abstract": "We conducted a retrospective analysis to clarify the clinical profile of a nonsurgical approach to small cell carcinoma of the esophagus (SCEC).SCEC patients in our database were reviewed. Consistent with the standard approach to small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCLC), chemoradiotherapy was the first choice for limited disease (LD)-SCEC in our institution while chemotherapy was the first choice for extensive disease (ED)-SCEC. Our strategy did not include prophylactic cranial irradiation.Eighteen patients were treated between January 1996 and December 2006, of whom 10 had LD-SCEC and 8 had ED-SCEC. Regarding response to chemoradiotherapy in patients with LD-SCEC, CR rate at the primary site was 90% (9/10) and total CR rate was 80% (8/10). With a median follow-up period of 55.3 months, median survival time in LD-SCEC and ED-SCEC patients was 17.3 and 13.9 months, respectively, showing no significant difference (p = 0.57). Brain metastases occurred in only one patient. On follow-up, eight patients with LD-SCEC and seven with ED-SCEC died of disease. Only 2 patients died of local progression, while the remaining 13 died of disease progression of distant metastases.Despite providing good local control, chemoradiotherapy appeared to have insufficient potential to cure LD-SCEC. Prophylactic brain irradiation for SCEC is unnecessary.",

To examine whether variations of hematocytes constitute one of the genetic components in atherosclerosis, irradiated apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice with hypercholesterolemia and preexisting atherosclerotic lesions were reconstituted with mixed bone marrow cells (BMC) from syngeneic and wild-type (apoE(+/+); atherosclerosis-resistant SJL or -susceptible B10.S) mice. Stable mixed allogeneic chimeras with small amounts of serum apoE were established without any detrimental complications. Compared with untreated apoE(-/-) mice or apoE(-/-) mice transplanted with syngeneic BMC alone, significant reduction of the cholesterol level and significant lesion regression were observed in the mixed chimeras. Furthermore, mixed chimeras given SJL BMC showed marked reductions in numbers of lesions compared with those reconstituted with B10.S BMC. Cholesterol levels in the former SJL chimeras, however, were significantly higher than those in the latter B10.S chimeras. These findings indicate that the resistance of SJL to atherosclerosis resides in the bone marrow-derived cells.",

However, molecular biological markers to predict recurrence have not been identified. Here, we aimed to identify markers of recurrence using DNA microarray profiling in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (TSCC). Methods: We conducted exploratory Affymetrix gene expression profiling using 26 primary tumor tissue samples from patients meeting the following criteria: 1) histologically confirmed TSCC, 2) surgical resection of the primary tumor and lymph node dissection, and 3) follow-up for longer than one year after surgery. Median age and pathological stage were 60 years (37-85) and pStageIII/IV = 8%/92% (pT: 2/3/4a = 3/1/22, pN: 0/1/2a/2b/2c = 5/5/0/8/8), respectively.

        "abstract": "Polyoxometalates (POMs) is a unique metallic cluster that exhibit very strong acidic and oxidative catalysis with less corrodibility. In this paper, we report two examples of POM reaction systems under microwave irradiation based on the microwave absorption mechanisms of POM-based catalysts. The microwave-susceptive solid catalyst exhibits non-equilibrium local heating in the vicinity of the catalyst and facilitates heterogeneous chemical reactions at milder condition than conventional heating. The POMs (phosphotungstic and silicotungstic acids) were, therefore, supported on activated carbons as microwave susceptors to enhance microwave absorption of the solid catalyst. Then, the POM based solid catalysts were applied for hydrolysis of biomass under microwave irradiation. The carbon-supported POMs exhibited higher activity on hydrolysis of cellobiose and green seaweeds than conventional heating. The dielectric loss of carbon-supported POMs exhibited positive correlation with saccharification rate indicating that direct microwave absorption by the solid catalyst was important to enhance the reactions. In the case of homogeneous system, oxidation of benzyl alcohols in DMSO was conducted by using POM (phosphomolybdic acid) under three microwave frequencies in ISM bands (915 MHz, 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz). We found that the selectivity to benzaldehyde was enhanced at 915MHz and 5.8 GHz rather than 2.45 GHz by 18.6% and 31.8%, respectively. The dielectric measurement using the coaxial probe method revealed that absorption of POM-DMSO system at 915MHz and 5.8 GHz were due to ionic conduction of POMs and dipolar dielectric loss of DMSO, respectively. The results suggested that different microwave-absorption mechanism of POM-DMSO system have led to different oxidation catalysis.",

        "abstract": "The expression of allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, a model for T helper 1 (Th1) type disease, was investigated in BALB/c mice. The AIF-1 expression was significantly increased in the colitis lesion compared to that in the normal colon. We then prepared AIF-1 transgenic mice (Tgm) with the BALB/c background that express high levels of AIF-1 in lymphoid tissues and the colon. When AIF-1 Tgm were administrated TNBS, the TNBS-induced colitis was ameliorated compared with that in non-transgenic littermates. The amelioration of colitis was associated with the low expression of interleukin-1beta in the colon. The present findings suggest that AIF-1 regulates Th1-type inflammatory responses.",

        "abstract": "573 Background: BRAFV600E mutation has been recognized as a prognostic marker in patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Several studies have consistently shown a significant association between the presence of BRAFV600E mutation and resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy in pts with previously treated mCRC while there are few reports on the clinical impact of minor BRAF mutations. Methods: The BREAC trial was a multicenter, retrospective study to investigate the novel biomarkers of anti-EGFR antibody therapy. RAS and BRAF mutations were detected by targeted sequencing using FFPE materials of mCRC pts who received anti-EGFR antibody after a failure to standard therapies. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response rate (RR) were evaluated according to expanded RAS/BRAF mutational status. Results: Of 184 pts enrolled in the study, RAS/BRAF testing was succeeded in 150 pts. Patients characteristics were as follows; male/female 87/63, median age 63.5 years (range, ...",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tissue factor (TF), expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) and enriched in human atherosclerotic lesions, acts as a critical initiator of blood coagulation in acute coronary syndrome. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) induces the proliferation and migration of ECs and plays a role in angiogenesis and restoration of endothelial integrity. As TF is implicated in angiogenesis, we studied the effect of bFGF on TF gene and protein expression. Methods: Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were exposed to bFGF. TF mRNA was assessed by Northern blot and TF protein was assessed by Western blot. TF promoter activity was assessed by transient transfection assay and transcription factor was identified by electro mobility shift assay. RESULTS: bFGF increased TF mRNA and protein expression in HUVECs. Increased TF mRNA was attenuated by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase in human ECV304 cells. Transient transfection assays of the human TF promoter-luciferase construct (-786/+121 bp) demonstrated that bFGF induced transcription was dependent on the elements within the -197 to -176 bp relative to the transcription start site of the human TF gene. This region contains NF-kappaB like binding site. Electro mobility shift assay showed that bFGF increased nuclear translocation or DNA binding of NF-kappaB transcription factor to TF promoter. Nucleotide substitution to disrupt NF-kappaB like site reduced bFGF stimulated promoter activity. Fenofibric acid, an agonist ligand for the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha, reduced basal and bFGF stimulated TF expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that bFGF may increase TF production in ECs through activation of transcription at NF-kappaB binding site, and control coagulation in vessel walls. Fibrate can inhibit TF expression and therefore reduce the thrombogenecity of human atherosclerotic lesions.",

        "abstract": "It is extremely rare to encounter tumors arising exclusively in the minor duodenal papilla. We report a 60-year-old male patient with a polypoid type of adenocarcinoma of the minor papilla. Preoperative examinations, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), suggested pancreas divisum and showed a series of stones in the dorsal pancreatic duct. The patient underwent subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSpPD). On histology, an adenocarcinoma was located in the minor papilla, which was limited to the mucosa, without invasion of the duodenum, sphincter muscles of the minor papilla, or the underlying pancreas. The carcinoma cells, together with dysplastic and hyperplastic epithelium of the pancreatic duct, extended peripherally within the pancreatic duct. No cystic dilatation of the pancreatic duct was observed. The ventral pancreatic duct was short and narrow; there was evidence of chronic pancreatitis in the dorsal pancreas, whereas the ventral pancreas was almost normal, suggesting the existence of pancreas divisum. Although it is well known that adenocarcinoma of the duodenal papilla is sometimes accompanied by intraepithelial spread in the pancreatic duct, an adenocarcinoma arising in the minor papilla in this case with pancreas divisum was more extended than our thoughts.",

We observed this area by HF ocean radar and got the first-order peaks corresponding to Doppler frequency of the phase velocity satisfied Bragg resonance conditions. Also there are the two spectral peaks within a radar footprint area. This implies that there are two different flows in this area and it seems to be appeared a shear front or an eddy in a radar footprint.

According to theories on post-decision processes, preferences are likely to be reconstructed in line with a preceding choice. The present study hypothesized that preferences are constructed so that superior (inferior) attributes of a chosen alternative are weighted higher (lower) than before. This hypothesis was tested in a field survey of university students in Japan. The data supported the hypothesis that the weights of the superior (inferior) attributes of the chosen alternative increased (decreased) as time passed since the decision was made. This result suggests the validity of the causal relationship in which choice shapes preference, which is the reverse of what is generally assumed in decision research.",

Application of 5 microM K-252b, an ecto-protein kinase inhibitor, blocked LTP induced by a theta-burst stimulation (3 bursts composed of 5 pulses at 100 Hz with inter-burst intervals of 200 ms). On the other hand, under 10 microM RK682, an ecto-phosphatase inhibitor, a robust LTP was induced by a weak theta-burst stimulation (3 bursts composed of 3 pulses) which was just at the threshold for the induction of LTP in the control perfusate. These findings suggest that ATP released from presynaptic terminals during the burst stimulation plays an important role in the induction of LTP through phosphorylation of extracellular domains of synaptic membrane proteins, as the substrate for ecto-protein kinase.",

Sixty-three atheromatous plaques (symptomatic 51, asymptomatic 12) were obtained from 57 patients who underwent CEA. The presence of an intraplaque hemorrhage was noted in 75% from symptomatic plaques, compared with 33% from asymptomatic ones. A plaque disruption occurred over protruding mounds of intraplaque hemorrhage and was noted in 76% and 42% from symptomatic and asymptomatic ones, respectively. However, asymptomatic plaques, which were angiographically demonstrated as carotid ulcer of types B and C, had a high incidence of intraplaque hemorrhage as well as plaque disruption. Three patients followed with asymptomatic contralateral carotid artery disease developed a stroke following ipsilateral revascularization and all three specimens showed the presence of plaque hemorrhage and disruption. It is concluded that before prophylactic CEA is considered, an intraplaque hemorrhage and/or plaque disruption should be detected by less invasive procedures such as ultrasonography.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:  Simple vascular function measurements are desirable for atherosclerosis risk assessments. Recently, we developed a novel modality of automated oscillometric method to measure a brachial artery’s vascular elastic modulus (V E ) and reported that V E  is uninfluenced by blood pressure. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) expressed in endothelial cells regulates vascular fibrosis and is a molecular determinant of vascular stiffness.   Hypothesis:  We aimed to clarify whether V E  selectively correlates with marker of vascular stiffness in chronic kidney disease (CKD).   Methods:  12 moderate-to-severe CKD pts (mean eGFR 25.9±23.5 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) and 15 controls were studied. Rest V E  in brachial artery was measured by new automated oscillometric detector. V E  was defined as follows [VE =ΔPressure/ (100XΔarea/Area) mmHg/%]. Using ultrasound, the brachial artery diameter at rest and during reactive hyperemia [flow mediated dilatation (FMD) with endothelial-dependent dilatation] was measured. Gal-3 and interleukin-6 (IL-6), a representative inflammatory marker, were measured by enzyme-linked immune assay.   Results:  CKD had lower FMD (4.86±3.37 vs 9.05±2.98 %, P=0.003) and had attenuated V E  than control (1.08±0.26 vs 0.83±0.17 mmHg/%, P=0.002). CKD had higher IL-6 (0.67±0.29 vs 0.29±0.33 pg/mL, P=0.003) and higher Gal-3 (20.0±12.4 vs. 5.84±2.83 pg/mL, P E  was negatively correlated with %FMD (r=-0.46, P=0.015) and correlated with Gal-3 (r=0.40, P=0.036) but not in IL-6 (r=0.21, P=0.28).   Conclusions:  Attenuated vascular elasticity detected by this novel approach closely correlated with increase in Gal-3 and reduced FMD in CKD. This may indicate that the attenuated vascular elasticity selectively reflects vascular fibrosis as evidenced by Gal-3 and subsequent endothelial responses to vascular stiffness. Thus, this oscillometric measurement may be useful for detecting vascular fibrosis information and dysfunction in endothelium level.",

        "abstract": "Increasing vascular diameter and attenuated vascular elasticity may be reliable markers for atherosclerotic risk assessment. However, previous measurements have been complex, operator-dependent or invasive. Recently, we developed a new automated oscillometric method to measure a brachial artery's estimated area (eA) and volume elastic modulus (VE). The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability of new automated oscillometric measurement of eA and VE. Rest eA and VE were measured using the recently developed automated detector with the oscillometric method. eA was estimated using pressure/volume curves and VE was defined as follows (VE=Δ pressure/ (100 × Δ area/area) mm Hg/%). Sixteen volunteers (age 35.2±13.1 years) underwent the oscillometric measurements and brachial ultrasound at rest and under nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. Oscillometric measurement was performed twice on different days. The rest eA correlated with ultrasound-measured brachial artery area (r=0.77, P<0.001). Rest eA and VE measurement showed good reproducibility (eA: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.88, VE: ICC=0.78). Under NTG stress, eA was significantly increased (12.3±3.0 vs. 17.1±4.6 mm(2), P<0.001), and this was similar to the case with ultrasound evaluation (4.46±0.72 vs. 4.73±0.75 mm, P<0.001). VE was also decreased (0.81±0.16 vs. 0.65±0.11 mm Hg/%, P<0.001) after NTG. Cross-sectional vascular area calculated using this automated oscillometric measurement correlated with ultrasound measurement and showed good reproducibility. Therefore, this is a reliable approach and this modality may have practical application to automatically assess muscular artery diameter and elasticity in clinical or epidemiological settings.",

        "abstract": "Metastatic lung cancers from the colon and rectum (MLCR) frequently have necrotic components. The aim of this study is to elucidate clinicopathological factors associated with the amount of necrosis in MLCR. Ninety patients who underwent the first pulmonary metastasectomy for MLCR with a tumor diameter ≦ 3.0 cm and without chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. Analyzing digitally scanned pathological slides, we calculated the necrosis percentage (NP, the necrosis area divided by the tumor area). The relationship between NP and clinicopathological factors was analyzed. Moreover, to determine whether NP was affected by tissue hypoxia, vascularization, or tumor cell proliferation, tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining using carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), CD34 antibodies, and Ki-67 antibodies, respectively. Median tumor area and NP were 0.69 cm (0.11-3.01) and 13.1% (0-71.6), respectively. Although NP was not associated with the tumor area, it was significantly higher in the patients with a positive smoking history (8.14% vs 17.1%, p = 0.045). Other clinicopathological factors were not correlated with NP. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CA IX expression on tumor cells, CD34 micro-vessel density, CD34 micro-vessel area, and Ki-67 index were not significantly associated with NP. NP in the primary site was not associated with NP in the pulmonary metastasis. NP was not determined by tumor size, tissue hypoxia, vascularization, or tumor cell proliferation. Positive correlation of NP with smoking history suggests a unique lung microenvironment in smokers which makes necrosis of MLCR more likely to occur.",

The paper examines this claim, noting that many evaluation studies have employed,less than optimal research designs. Demonstrating the use of  meta-analysis, the results of 15 Japanese TFPs showthat the effect sizes estimated for the frequently  used research design lacking adequate control groups differ from the effect sizes estimated for  research designs including adequate control groups.In addition, estimates of the homogeneity of  treatment effects appear to differ, thus suggestingthat inferences of causes of the effectiveness of a  TFP vary with research design.

Based on the function of \"cellular recycling\", autophagy plays key roles in the quality control of cellular components as well as supplying nutrients and materials for newly constructed structures in cells under metabolic stresses. The physiological relevance of autophagy in tumor formation and progression is still controversial. The cytoprotective function of autophagy in cells subjected to starvation might enhance the prolonged survival of tumor cells that are often exposed to metabolic stresses in vivo. Meanwhile, a tumor-suppressive function of autophagy has also been suggested. Autophagy-related cell death has been regarded as a primary mechanism for tumor suppression. In addition, the loss of autophagy induced genome instability and significant necrosis with inflammation in transplanted mouse tumor models, suggesting an additional function of autophagy in the suppression of tumor formation and growth. Until now, investigations supporting and proving the above possibilities have not been fully completed using clinical samples and equivalent animal models. Though monitoring and the interpretation of autophagy dynamism in tumor tissues are still technically difficult, identifying the autophagic activity in clinical samples might be necessary to clarify the pathophysiological relevance of autophagy in tumor formation and progression as well as to develop new therapeutic strategies based on the regulation of autophagy.",

The dielectric properties of catalysts are among the relevant parameters facilitating catalytic reactions under electromagnetic radiation. This study describes the dielectric properties of polyoxometalate catalysts in aqueous and organic solutions to understand the mechanism of interactions between polyoxometalates and electromagnetic waves. Specific loss factors of polyoxometalates were observed at lower frequencies (<1 GHz) by the ionic conduction of the polyoxometalate solution. The evolution of ionic conduction depended strongly on cations rather than anions. Proton-type polyoxometalates exhibited significantly higher loss factors than other cations did. The activation energy for ionic conduction in protonated silicotungstic acid (H₄SiWO) was significantly low in water (7.6⁻14.1 kJ/mol); therefore, the high loss factor of protonated polyoxometalates in water was attributed to the proton relay mechanism (i.e., Grotthuss mechanism). The results suggested that the proton relay mechanism at the radio-frequency band is critical for generating selective interactions of polyoxometalates with applied electromagnetic fields.",

HGF increased the human PAI-1 promoter (-829 to +36 bp) activity, and deletion and mutation analysis uncovered a functional E box (5'-CACATG-3') at positions -158 to -153 bp. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that this E box binds upstream stimulatory factors (USFs). HGF phosphorylated USFs through MAPK and tyrosine kinase pathways. Co-transfection of USF1 expression vector increased PAI-1 promoter activity. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 attenuated HGF-inducible PAI-1 promoter activity.Because USFs are involved in the regulation of carbohydrates and lipid metabolism, HGF-mediated PAI-1 production may provide a novel link between atherothrombosis and metabolic derangements. Targeting HGF signaling pathway may modulate the thrombotic risk in high-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "Overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an epigenetic repressor, occurs in various malignancies and is associated with poor prognosis; however, the functional role of EZH2 overexpression in cancer versus non-cancerous tissue remains unclear. In this study, we found an inverse correlation between EZH2 and E-cadherin gene expression in gastric cancer cells. Knockdown of EZH2 by short interfering RNA in gastric cancer cells resulted in a restoration of the E-cadherin gene. We showed that the EZH2 complex existed with histone H3 and Lys27, which were methylated on E-cadherin promoter regions in gastric cancer cells. The restoration of E-cadherin was not involved in the change of the DNA methylation status in the E-cadherin promoter region. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the expression of E-cadherin protein present in the cell membrane was restored after knockdown of EZH2, resulting in changing the cancer phenotype, such as its invasive capacity. In vivo, the relationship of inverse expression between EZH2 protein and E-cadherin protein was observed at the individual cellular level in gastric cancer tissue. This study provides into the mechanisms underlying the functional role of EZH2 overexpression in gastric cancer cells and a new modality of regulation of E-cadherin expression in silencing mechanisms of tumor suppressor genes. Our present study paves the way for exploring the blockade of EZH2 overexpression as a novel approach to treating cancer.",

        "abstract": "We previously reported that plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) mRNA was present at higher steady-state levels in prematurely senescent fibroblasts derived from a subject with Werner syndrome (WS) compared to early passage (EP) fibroblasts from an age-matched normal subject (Murano et al., 1991, Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:3905-3914). To explore the generally of this phenomenon with respect to chronological age of donor (in vivo aging) and the late-passage (LP) or senescent phase of the fibroblast replicative lifespan, we assayed PAI-1 mRNA in cells and PAI-1 antigen in medium conditioned by 20 normal fibroblast strains at EP and LP and six WS strains during their curtailed replicative lifespans. The lowest accumulations of PAI-1 were found in medium conditioned by fetal and newborn cells with a shallow but progressive rise seen in postnatal cells from normal donors of increasing chronological age. With few exceptions, normal LP fibroblasts showed increased PAI-1 accumulations in medium compared to their EP counterparts. Conditioned medium from four of the six WS strains showed PAI-1 accumulations that were significantly higher than the media of any normal controls at EP and LP. PAI-1 mRNa levels were generally commensurate with the cumulative amount of PAI-1 in the medium but the frequent exceptions indicate that translational and post-translational mechanisms also regulate PAI-1 output. The augmentation in PAI-1 output of fibroblasts as a direct function of chronological age and during in vitro senescence suggests that PAI-1 may play an important role in the reduced capacity for wound healing and the increasing tendency to thrombogenesis and atherogenesis seen during biological aging and in particular in persons with Werner syndrome.",

        "abstract": "We have previously reported that acute and chronic nicotine exposure lower the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in the rat hippocampal CA1 region, and acute application of nicotine in the chronic-nicotine-treated hippocampus further reduces the threshold. However, it is unknown how withdrawal from chronic nicotine exposure affects the induction of LTP. Here, we show that, following nicotine withdrawal, the threshold for LTP induction fluctuates before returning to the basal level and acute nicotine is no longer effective in lowering the threshold at 4 days after withdrawal. Chronic nicotine-induced enhancement of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor responses slowly diminishes and returns to the control level by 8 days of withdrawal. In 4-day-withdrawn hippocampi, there is functional up-regulation of postsynaptic alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on interneurons in the stratum radiatum, whereas the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid from their terminals is reduced. In both control and chronic nicotine-exposed hippocampi, acute nicotine depresses monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded in pyramidal cells but has almost no effect at 4 days of withdrawal. The lack of effect is due, at least in part, to the loss of a presynaptic nicotine effect. These withdrawal-induced changes are accompanied by decreases in normal nicotine-induced enhancement of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor responses, which may be responsible for the lack of acute nicotine-mediated facilitation of LTP induction in 4-day-withdrawn hippocampi. These withdrawal-induced changes may contribute to the cellular basis of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms and, thus, nicotine dependence.",

This research conducted a randomized social experiment aiming at citizen car-use reduction, and examined the effect of implementing two personalized travel plans: action plans and coping plans. The two types of plans were designed respectively for enhancing action planning and coping planning as the volitional factors of behavior change. The results supported the effectiveness of the combined action-plus-coping plan intervention in reducing car use, but not of the action plan alone intervention. In addition, the influence of intervention on behavioral intention, action planning, and coping planning, were also presented.",

        "abstract": "Like neurons and astrocytes, oligodendrocytes have a variety of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. However, except for facilitating the rapid conduction of action potentials by forming myelin and buffering extracellular K(+), little is known about the direct involvement of oligodendrocytes in neuronal activities. To investigate their physiological roles, we focused on oligodendrocytes in the alveus of the rat hippocampal CA1 region. These cells were found to respond to exogenously applied glutamate by depolarization through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and non-NMDA receptors. Electrical stimulation of the border between the alveus and stratum oriens evoked inward currents through several routes involving glutamate receptors and inward rectifier K(+) channels. Moreover, electrical stimulation resembling in vivo activity evoked long-lasting depolarization. To examine the modulatory effects of oligodendrocytes on neuronal activities, we performed dual, whole-cell recording on CA1 pyramidal neurons and oligodendrocytes. Direct depolarization of oligodendrocytes shortened the latencies of action potentials evoked by antidromic stimulation. These results indicate that oligodendrocytes increase the conduction velocity of action potentials by a mechanism additional to saltatory conduction, and that they have active roles in information processing in the brain.",

The objective is to evaluate the frequency of cancer genome alterations in aNon-CRC and to identify patients (pts) who are candidate for clinical trial for corresponding targeting agents. Methods: Pts with aNon-CRC including esophageal cancer (EC), gastric cancer (GC), and other types of aNon-CRC. Twenty ng of DNA and 10 ng of RNA were extracted from FFPE tumor samples and were analyzed by the Oncomine Cancer Research Panel (OCP) which allows to detect gene mutation, copy number variant (CNV) and fusions across 143 genes in a CLIA certified CAP accredited laboratory. The detected genomic variant data were classified according to whether genetic driver of cancer including gain- and loss-of-function or single nucleotide variant based on the Oncomine Knowledgebase.

However, specific roles for the TRβ isoform in metamorphosis are poorly understood. To address this issue, we generated disrupted  tadpoles using the CRISPR-Cas system We first established a highly efficient and rapid workflow for gene disruption in the founder generation (F0) by injecting sgRNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. Most embryos showed severe mutant phenotypes carrying high somatic mutation rates. Utilizing this founder analysis system, we examined the role of  in metamorphosis. -disrupted pre-metamorphic tadpoles exhibited mixed responsiveness to exogenous TH. Specifically, gill resorption and activation of several TH-response genes, including  itself and two protease genes, were impaired. However, hind limb outgrowth and induction of the TH-response genes,  and , were not affected by loss of  Surprisingly, disrupted tadpoles were able to undergo spontaneous metamorphosis normally, except for a slight delay in tail resorption. These results indicate TRβ is not required but contributes to the timing of resorptive events of metamorphosis.",

        "abstract": "Renal dysfunction is a significant risk factor in the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular diseases. We sought to determine the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values and in-hospital mortality in Japanese acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. A total of 2266 consecutive AMI patients admitted to 22 hospitals in Hokkaido were registered. The eGFR values were determined using the following equation: eGFR=194 × (serum creatinine)(-1.094) × (age)(-0.287) ( × 0.739 if female). Patients were classified into four groups according to their eGFR values: ≥60 (n=1304), 30-59 (n=810), 15-29 (n=87) and <15 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) (n=65). A total of 110 patients (4.9%) died during hospitalization. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with reduced eGFR values at 2.3, 5.4, 24.1 and 23.1% for eGFR values of ≥60, 30-59, 15-29, and <15 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2), respectively. The odds ratios for in-hospital all cause death were 8.26 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.22-30.77) for eGFR<15 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) and 3.42 (95% CI: 1.01-11.61) for eGFR 15-29 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) compared with eGFR ≥60 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2). Similarly, the odds ratios for in-hospital cardiac death were 8.43 (95% CI: 1.82-39.05) for eGFR<15 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) and 5.47 (95% CI: 1.51-19.80) for eGFR 15-29 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2). In conclusion, the eGFR of <30 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) was a significant and independent risk for in-hospital mortality in abroad cohort of Japanese patients with AMI.",

We investigated the effects of adenosine A1 or A2 receptor antagonists (8-cyclopentyltheophylline (8-CPT) and CP-66713, respectively) on LTP suppression in CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices. When the LFS was delivered in the presence of 8-CPT (1 microM), LTP suppression was not significantly affected. However, when LFS was delivered in the presence of CP-66713 (10 microM), LTP suppression was inhibited, leading to successful LTP induction. These results indicate that endogenous adenosine, acting via A2 receptors, is involved in the mechanism of LTP suppression.",

        "abstract": "Effects of the mono- and tetra-sialogangliosides, GM1 and GQ1b, on long-term potentiation (LTP) were investigated in the CA1 neurons of guinea-pig hippocampal slices. The magnitude of LTP induced by a strong tetanus (100 Hz, 100 pulses) was not significantly affected by application of either ganglioside. In contrast, when LTP was induced by a weak tetanus (100 Hz, 4 pulses), a significantly greater LTP was induced in the presence of either ganglioside. Similarly, when slices were incubated in low-Ca2+ (1.0-1.1 mM) medium for more than 2 h, the LTP was usually small or absent, but showed a significant increase in amplitude of population spike (A-PS) when the slices were incubated with either GM1 or GQ1b (4-5 microg/ml). In addition, the application of GQ1b (4 microg/ml) reversed the blocking effect of an NMDA-receptor antagonist, APP-5 (10 microM), on the induction of LTP and resulted in forming LTP. Based on these findings, we conclude that GM1 and GQ1b exert positive modulatory effects on the induction of LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons and suggest that GM1 and GQ1b may participate in the induction of LTP as donors of Ca2+ ions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sloshing is the movement of liquid in a container induced by an external force. The phenomenon has been extensively studied at the macroscopic scale because of the importance of liquid control in tanks. Sloshing at the microliter scale should be explored for microdroplets in Lab-on-a-chip applications. We therefore verified the sloshing characteristics of droplets in microliter-sized wells. A water-in-oil droplet in the well was vibrated horizontally at between 20 and 100 Hz. Circular and elliptic wells between 2 and 5 mm sizes were applied for the well geometry. The surface chemistry of the well was additionally changed by using amphiphobic coatings to examine the effect of the interfacial tension between the well surface and the liquid, because we considered it a dominant factor at the microliter scale. Decreasing the well diameter caused the natural frequency to increase and the sloshing to suppress. This agreed with Housner’s equation, which is conventionally used for macroscopic scale. The experiments also revealed that decreasing the interfacial tension caused the natural frequency to increase and resulted in drastic suppression of the sloshing, which was characterized by Bond number, similarly with the cases under microgravity. We experimentally verified that at the microliter scale, the interfacial tension is dominant to control the sloshing phenomenon.",

Herein, we used tissue microarrays and immunohistochemically analyzed PD-L1 and various tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) in specimens from 196 ESCC patients who had undergone curative resection without preoperative therapy. PD-L1 expressions in tumor cells (TCs) and TIICs, as well as infiltration of lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+, FOXP3+, and PD- 1+) and macrophages (CD68+ and CD204+), were evaluated. PD-L1 was expressed in TCs of 18.4% and in TIICs of 83.3% of these patients. PD-L1 expressions in TCs and TIICs were associated with significant infiltration of various TIIC types, especially CD8+ cells. PD-L1 expressions in both TCs and TIICs were significantly associated with favorable overall survival, and combining their levels enhanced prognostic accuracy. Prognostic impacts of PD-L1 expressions in TCs and TIICs, abundant PD-1+ cell infiltration, a high CD8+/FOXP3+ ratio, and the CD8+/CD204+ ratio remained significant after adjusting for clinicopathological factors. In conclusion, PD-L1 expression reflects anti-tumor immunity, and PD-1/PD-L1 expression and the ratio of infiltrating effector to immune suppressor cells have prognostic value. Therapeutic strategies inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 signal and immune suppressor cells are anticipated in ESCC patients.",

        "abstract": "Early-staged cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is difficult to diagnose due to its high potential for invasion and metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in a process thought to be important for invasion and metastasis in several cancers, including CCA. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several malignancies, their roles to CCA are not clearly understood. Some miRNAs were reported to be included in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and transferred from their donor cells to other cells, modulating recipient cell behaviors. In this study, the involvement and functional roles of EV-contained miRNAs during EMT in human CCA were determined. Expression profiling identified a subset of miRNAs that were reduced by TGF-β in CCA cells. Among these, miR-30e was highly downregulated by TGF-β and predicted to target Snail, which is an EMT-inducible transcription factor. MiR-30e overexpression suppressed cell invasion and migration via inhibiting EMT, whereas miR-30e inhibition promoted EMT, cell invasion and migration. Moreover, miR-30e was enriched in EVs derived from CCA cells after miR-30e overexpression, and miR-30e intercellular transfer through EVs suppressed EMT, cell invasion and migration in recipient CCA cells. Together, our results suggest that EV-mediated miR-30e transfer could inhibit EMT via directly targeting Snail, which subsequently suppresses CCA cell invasion and migration. These findings provide several new insights into regulatory mechanisms of tumor invasion and metastasis in human CCA.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease. Natural killer T cells are a unique lymphocyte subset that can recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1d and secrete copious amounts of pro-atherogenic cytokines such as interferon-gamma. We have previously shown that natural killer T cells accelerate atherosclerosis in mice and macrophages incubated with oxidized low-density lipoproteins induce natural killer T cells to produce interferon-gamma. Thus, whether the prevalence of natural killer T cells in peripheral blood is altered in patients with angina pectoris and its correlation with coronary risk factors was determined.Cell profiling was performed using flow cytometry in patients with stable angina, unstable angina (Braunwald IIIB), and healthy controls. Natural killer T cells in peripheral blood were identified by the expression of natural killer T specific invariant T cell receptor alpha-chain (Valpha24) and T cell receptor beta-chain (Vbeta11).Prevalence of natural killer T (Valpha24-Vbeta11 double positive) cells was significantly decreased in patients with unstable angina and stable angina compared with that in controls. No significant differences were observed in the prevalence between unstable and stable angina. Reduction of natural killer T cells was independently associated with the presence of angina.Lower prevalence of circulating natural killer T cells is related to the presence of coronary artery disease. As T cell receptor down-regulation or apoptosis after natural killer T cell activation and subsequent interferon-gamma release may contribute to atherogenesis, natural killer T cells can become a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular diseases.",

        "abstract": "Individuals with metabolic syndrome reportedly have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, although the association between asymptomatic myocardial damage and metabolic syndrome has not been sufficiently investigated. The present study investigated possible associations between circulating cardiac troponin and metabolic syndrome or related factors. Subjects undergoing their annual health checkups were enrolled in the study (n = 1242). Laboratory measurements included serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Individual salt intake was estimated by calculating 24-h urinary sodium excretion from spot urine. Subjects whose electrocardiograms revealed ST-T segment abnormalities or who had renal insufficiency or a history of cardiovascular events were excluded. Subjects with metabolic syndrome had higher hs-cTnI levels than those without, but their BNP levels were equivalent. hs-cTnI levels were significantly associated with the presence and components of metabolic syndrome. Logistic regression analysis with the endpoint of hs-cTnI levels higher than the median value identified metabolic syndrome as an independent determinant of increased hs-cTnI levels. Additionally, urinary salt excretion levels were increased in subjects with metabolic syndrome or any of its components. Logistic regression analysis with the endpoint of metabolic syndrome revealed that hs-cTnI levels were independently associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome. A close association between hs-cTnI levels and the presence of metabolic syndrome, at least partially mediated by increased salt intake, was confirmed to exist in the general population. The findings support the idea that patients with metabolic syndrome develop asymptomatic myocardial damage without obvious ischaemic findings, which leads to increased cardiovascular risk.",

In a questionnaire study (study 1) ( n =60), the fit of a structural model estimated with maximum-likelihood methods available in LISREL8 confirmed the hypothesized causal relations between rated attitude towards driving, self-reported frequency of driving choice, and degree of script-based driving choice. In Study 2, it was found that participants' ( n =48) attitudes towards driving correlated with fictitious driving choice in a laboratory task whereas self-reported frequency of driving choice and degree of script-based driving choice did not. Finally, in Study 3 non-drivers ( n =50) repeatedly made fictitious choices between driving or walking and choices of destination. After repeated choices of driving, driving choices were as expected made more frequently when destinations were within walking distance.",

In Study 1 a first wave of a panel survey of 53 students at different Japanese universities was conducted 2 months before the students graduated, a second wave 3 months after graduation when the students had been employed by companies at different other locations. In many cases the change after the graduation resulted in change of respondents’ commuting mode. The results showed that script-based travel mode choice developed in those who had changed travel mode most (either to more public transport use or more automobile use). Study 2 indicated that frequent drivers who changed to public transport during a 8-day freeway closure continued to use public transport more frequently one year after the closure than did those drivers who did not change to public transport during the closure. This enduring effect was interpreted to reflect the development of a script-based travel mode choice.",

Using a droplet contact device previously developed, constant-voltage steps were applied to the pre-bilayer membrane and carefully controlled the electric stress in response to the membrane features, based on optical and current monitoring. We examined the pathways of the membrane formation and disruption, and discovered a qualitative protocol for oil-layer-free BLM formation. We succeeded in BLM formation using 1:1-mixture of hexadecane and n-decane as an oil example, which was hardly available for the former studies using the device. The method would contribute to produce vivo-like membranes appropriate for membrane protein functionalities.",

        "abstract": "Despite the known abnormalities of cardiac function in patients with overt non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) the temporal changes of coronary capillary network remodeling leading to potential microcirculatory dysfunction have not been elucidated. To this end, left ventricular subendocardial capillary network of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, characterized by hypertension, obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and mild NIDDM, and control Long-Evans Tokushima (LETO) rats were investigated. Total capillary density in OLETF was significantly higher than that in LETO at 20 weeks, suggesting compensatory improvement of O2 transport at early stages of NIDDM. The increase in capillary density in OLETF was lost at 40 and 60 weeks due to the decreases of intermediate capillary portions and venular capillary portions. Although capillary domain area (area innervated by single capillary) in OLETF was lower than that in LETO at 20 weeks, the values were similar between OLETF and LETO at 40 and 60 weeks, suggesting that adaptive improvement in the capacity for 02 transport with a high perfusion was lost in late stages of NIDDM. Activity of plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the major physiologic inhibitor of proteo(fibrino)lysis, in OLETF was higher than that in LETO at 40 and 60 weeks, suggesting that increase of PAI-1 may downregulate compensatory adaptive capillary network remodeling by inhibiting proteolysis and angiogenesis in the cardiac interstitium. Loss of adaptive myocardial microcirculation may therefore contribute to increased vulnerability in ischemic injury and to cardiac dysfunction in NIDDM.",

        "abstract": "The reduction of the long-term potentiated response induced by tetanus (depotentiation (DP) of LTP) was investigated by the delivery of a train of low-frequency afferent stimuli (depotentiating stimulation: DPS) after the tetanus (100 Hz, 100 pulses) in CA1 neurons of the guinea pig's hippocampal slice. The parameters of DPS (frequencies of 1, 2, 5 and 10 Hz; number of pulses of 200 and 1000; and the time-lag after tetanus of 20 and 100 min) were altered systematically and their effects on LTP were evaluated through the analysis of the slope of field EPSP (S-EPSP) and amplitude and peak latency of population spike (A- and L-PS). DPS of 1 Hz, 1000 pulses, given 20 min after tetanus, reduced the potentiated component of S-EPSP, A-PS and L-PS by 68.5%, 80.1% and 56.1%, respectively (mean, n = 6), whereas it reduced the control response by 4.3%, 7.1%, and 1.9%, respectively (n = 6). Significantly less effectiveness was observed for DPS at higher frequencies (2-10 Hz), with smaller numbers of pulses, featuring a longer time-lag after tetanus and under APV administration. When DPS was applied before tetanus, significantly less robust LTP was observed. However, these effects were blocked by the administration of APV during DPS.",

        "abstract": "Sphingolipids make up a family of molecules associated with an array of biological functions, including cell death and migration. Sphingolipids are often altered in cancer, though how these alterations lead to tumor formation and progression is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens and cell lines and determined that ceramide synthase 6 (CERS6) is markedly overexpressed compared with controls. Elevated CERS6 expression was due in part to reduction of microRNA-101 (miR-101) and was associated with increased invasion and poor prognosis. CERS6 knockdown in NSCLC cells altered the ceramide profile, resulting in decreased cell migration and invasion in vitro, and decreased the frequency of RAC1-positive lamellipodia formation while CERS6 overexpression promoted it. In murine models, CERS6 knockdown in transplanted NSCLC cells attenuated lung metastasis. Furthermore, combined treatment with l-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposome and the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor D-PDMP induced cell death in association with ceramide accumulation and promoted cancer cell apoptosis and tumor regression in murine models. Together, these results indicate that CERS6-dependent ceramide synthesis and maintenance of ceramide in the cellular membrane are essential for lamellipodia formation and metastasis. Moreover, these results suggest that targeting this homeostasis has potential as a therapeutic strategy for CERS6-overexpressing NSCLC.",

Both agents decreased baseline and transforming growth factor-β induced—PAI-1 synthesis in cultured human vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and attenuated the increase in plasma PAI-1 activity and aortic PAI-1 gene expression induced by hypercholesterolemia and mechanically induced vascular injury in rabbits in vivo. Attenuation of the increase in plasma PAI-1 activity and aortic PAI-1 gene expression was associated with the decrease in the aortic atherosclerotic lesion area. Etofibrate and nicanartine may be useful in ameliorating the atherosclerotic process by directly acting on PAI-1 synthesis in vascular cells.",

This study investigated possible associations between electrocardiogram (ECG) findings relevant to the QRS wave and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) in the general population. Subjects undergoing their annual health checkup were enrolled in the study (n = 1258). ECG features relevant to the QRS wave that were investigated included PQ interval, QRS voltage (Sokolow-Lyon voltage), QRS duration, product of QRS duration and voltage (Cornell product), corrected QT interval, and QRS axis. Laboratory measurements included hs-cTnI and B-type natriuretic peptide. hs-cTnI was significantly higher in subjects with a long PQ interval, high Sokolow-Lyon voltage, wide QRS duration, increased Cornell product, long corrected QT interval, or left QRS axis deviation. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis showed that Sokolow-Lyon voltage, QRS duration, and Cornell product were significantly associated with hs-cTnI after adjustment for possible confounding factors, including B-type natriuretic peptide. Logistic regression analysis with the endpoint of higher hs-cTnI than the median value showed that Sokolow-Lyon voltage and Cornell product were independently associated with increased hs-cTnI concentrations. ECG findings relevant to the QRS wave, especially increased QRS voltage, are associated with hs-cTnI in the general population.",

Here, we describe a device for sequentially generating asymmetric lipid giant vesicles (GVs) with various combinations of asymmetric lipid leaflets. Various combinations of planar asymmetric lipid bilayers are formed by sliding and contacting the water in oil (phospholipid) (W/O) droplets in the collecting and jetting wells of our device. Next, we generate asymmetric lipid vesicles using a pulsed-jetting method. We sequentially generate three types of GVs: two asymmetric GVs containing fluorescent-conjugated phospholipids (either (i) rhodamine or (ii) BODIPY) on the outer leaflet, and (iii) a symmetric GV with phosphatidylcholine (PC) on the inner and outer leaflets. The use of asymmetric GVs with various combinations of asymmetric lipid leaflets reveals that increase in membrane phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) concentration influences cinnamycin activity and promotes the phospholipid flip-flop dynamics. This system will be useful for investigating activities of proteins or peptides on GV membranes with various combinations of lipid leaflets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Voluntary travel behavior change has been increasingly paid attention for promoting sustainable transportation. However, in the psychological process underlying the foundation of travel behavior change programs, the roles of volitional phase and its constructs have not been fully clarified. This research therefore incorporated coping planning, in addition to implementation intention, as two volitional constructs, to model the volitional phase of travel behavior change, and to investigate how the volitional constructs mediate between behavioral intention and behavior change. The data were collected from citizens in Taipei City, Taiwan, by two questionnaires across a one-month period. The main results suggested that implementation intention mediated the effect of behavioral intention on car use change only through the mediation of coping planning; that coping planning mediated between behavioral intention and car use change; and that the effectiveness of personalized travel plans in behavior change could be attributed to the volitional constructs. Based on the findings, the behavior change model incorporating coping planning could account for the effectiveness of implementation intention in travel behavior. Further implications of implementation intention and coping planning, and potential extension of behavior change process were discussed.",

        "abstract": "The effects of both the activation and the blockade of D1 or D2 dopamine receptors on long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission, and the involvement of NMDA and GABA receptors in LTD, were investigated in CA1 neurons of rat hippocampal slices. Low-frequency stimulation (LFS, 450 pulses at 1 Hz) produced LTD of the slope of field EPSPs (-14.3%, mean, n = 10). The induction of LTD was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist, AP5 (1.4%, n = 7), by the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH-23390 (3.5%, n = 8), or by the D2 receptor agonist, LY-171555 (4.4%, n = 8). Either the activation of D1 receptors by SKF-38393 or the blockade of D2 receptors by sulpiride produced significantly larger LTD than the control LTD (-31.1%, n = 11; -30.6%, n = 9, respectively). Although LTD was blocked by picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor/Cl- channel antagonist (4.9%, n = 8), LTD was produced by LFS in the medium containing both SKF-38393 and picrotoxin (-27.3%, n = 7). These results indicate that: (1) the induction of LTD by LFS in hippocampal CA1 neurons is under the influence of both NMDA and GABA receptors; (2) both D1 and D2 receptors are involved in the modulation of LTD in that the activation of D1 receptors enhances LTD, while that of D2 receptors inhibits LTD, and (3) while the induction of LTD is blocked by picrotoxin, this effect is superseded by SKF-38393.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, mice lacking the type 1 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) were used to study the role of type 1 IP(3)Rs in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 neurons. The magnitude of the LTP induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS) consisting of 20 pulses at 30Hz in mice lacking type 1 IP(3)Rs was significantly larger than that in wild-type mice in terms of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential and population spike. By measuring changes in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in CA1 pyramidal neurons using fluorometry, we found that the decay time of the transient increase in the [Ca(2+)](i) evoked by the HFS in mutant mice was significantly longer than that in wild-type mice, whereas the [Ca(2+)](i) at rest and the magnitude of the [Ca(2+)](i) increases caused by the HFS were no different from those in wild-type mice. In slices from the mutant mice, paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) delivered at an interval of 10ms resulted in significantly weaker paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) than in wild-type mice, suggesting that lack of type 1 IP(3)Rs reduces the PPI induced by PPS in the CA1 region. These results indicate that a lack of type 1 IP(3)Rs causes a slower decay of the transient [Ca(2+)](i) in CA1 pyramidal neurons and attenuates the activity of inhibitory interneurons, resulting in enhancement of LTP induction.",

This study sought to establish practical diagnostic criteria for performing curative resections, based on peritoneal lavage cytology findings in gastric cancer patients. We enrolled 1028 patients with gastric cancer who underwent R0/1 (n = 911) or R2 (n = 117) resections and analyzed relationships between cancer cell findings in peritoneal lavage fluid and clinicopathological factors in the R0/1 group. We found 68 patients with CY status. Receiver operating characteristic analyses and multivariate analyses showed that the presence of ≥1 signet ring cell, ≥5 cell clusters or ≥50 isolated cancer cells in peritoneal lavage fluid predicted poor prognoses in the 68 CY patients. High-risk CY group patients with at least one of the above predictors had the highest hazard ratio (HR = 3.28, P < 0.001). The remaining (low-risk) patients had a survival curve similar to that of patients with a normal cytology. The high-risk CY patients who underwent R1 resection had poor prognoses despite no macroscopic peritoneal metastasis (2% 5-year survival)-equivalent to that of patients who underwent R2 resection. The CY criteria defined in this study could help identify candidates for curative resection as an initial therapy for gastric cancer.",

Modulator recognition factor (Mrf) 2 knockout mice exhibit defects in fat accumulation and are protected from diet-induced obesity, suggesting that Mrf2 deficiency affects adipogenesis. Here, we report that the gene expressions of the 2 isoforms of the transcription factors Mrf2, Mrf2alpha, and Mrf2beta, were induced upon adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Mrf2 mRNA expression was sensitive to stimulation by insulin, dexamethasone, and TNF-alpha in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes. Down-regulation of Mrf2alpha and Mrf2beta gene expressions induced by small interfering RNAs increased the mRNA expression of leptin. These results indicate that Mrf2 can be a potential regulator of adipocyte differentiation and a potential repressor of leptin.",

        "abstract": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses was induced in the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) by the delivery of HFS (a tetanus of two trains of 100 pulses at 100 Hz with a 10s interval) and was reversed (depotentiated) by a train of LFS of 1000 pulses at 2 Hz applied 60 min later. This depotentiation was triggered by activation of inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) during HFS, which may increase the postsynaptic intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, leading to a cellular process responsible for modification of LTP expression at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Furthermore, we found that activation of IP3Rs or protein phosphatase during LFS was required for the reversal of LTP expressed at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. These results suggest that, in hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 neuron synapses, activation of IP3Rs by a preconditioning HFS results in modulation of IP3R activation and/or postsynaptic protein phosphorylation during a subsequent LFS, leading to a decrease in the field EPSP and the erasure of LTP.",

        "abstract": "Recent animal data have suggested that cancer-induced stroma consists of blood-borne fibroblasts as well as tissue-derived fibroblasts. In this study, mononuclear cells isolated from the pulmonary vein blood of lungs resected from lung cancer patients were cultured to confirm the presence of blood-borne fibroblast. In 34% (16 of 47) of the cases, spindle cells with fibroblast morphology proliferated in a disarrayed fashion and were positive for vimentin and collagen type I but negative for both specific myogenic and endothelial markers. The cDNA profiles of blood-borne fibroblasts, tissue-derived (lung) fibroblasts, human vascular smooth muscle cells (HSMCs), and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were clustered with a hierarchical classification algorithm. The profiles of the blood-borne fibroblasts were clearly isolated from those of the tissue-derived fibroblasts, HSMCs, and HUVECs. When carboxyfluorescein succinyl ester (CFSE)-labeled human mononuclear cells from the blood of lung cancer patients were transferred into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice engrafted with a human lung cancer xenograft, CFSE-labeled fibroblasts were found around the cancer nests. We investigated the several clinicopathological factors of blood-borne fibroblast-positive patients. The blood-borne fibroblast-positive cases had a significantly larger central fibrotic area in primary lung cancer than in the negative cases (123 +/- 29 vs. 59 +/- 13 mm(2); p = .02). Our results indicated that the blood in the vicinity of human lung cancer contains fibroblast progenitor cells that have the capacity to migrate into the cancer stroma and differentiate into fibroblasts having biological characteristics different from those of tissue-derived fibroblasts. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.",

Four of the five families showed germ line mutations in VHL gene, comprising 2 missense mutations, 1 deletion, and 1 splice-site mutation. Two families had VHL gene mutations at exon 1; 1 family at exon 3; and 1 family at the splice-site adjacent to exon 3. Presymptomatic patients were accurately diagnosed by these methods. However, one family did not show a VHL gene mutation in the germ line but showed a somatic mutation at exon 2 in the hemangioblastoma tissue. The consequence of the somatic mutation was a microdeletion leading to a frameshift mutation. Our study is the first report of VHL gene analyses of Japanese VHL disease families, and suggests that not only germ line mutation, but also somatic mutation can lead to development of a tumor associated with the VHL disease.",

        "abstract": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) inhibits fibrinolysis and proteolysis. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulates angiogenesis, which requires regional proteolysis. Because modulation of vasculopathy requires tight control of proteolysis, effects of bFGF on PAI-1 expression in endothelial cells (ECs) were characterized. bFGF increased PAI-1 mRNA and accumulation of PAI-1 protein in conditioned media in human umbilical vein ECs. The bFGF-mediated increase in PAI-1 mRNA was attenuated by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase in human ECV304 cells. The rate of decrease in PAI-1 mRNA after actinomycin D treatment was not affected by bFGF. Transient transfection assays of the human PAI-1 promoter-luciferase construct demonstrated that bFGF-induced PAI-1 transcription was dependent on the elements within the -313 to -260 bp relative to the transcription start site. This region contains an E26 transformation specific 1 (Ets-1)-like site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that bFGF increased nuclear translocation or DNA binding of the Ets-1-like transcription factor to the PAI-1 promoter. Nucleotide substitution to disrupt the Ets-1-like site reduced bFGF-stimulated promoter activity. Fenofibric acid, an agonist ligand for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, inhibited basal and bFGF-stimulated PAI-1 expression. By inducing PAI-1 expression from ECs, bFGF may control proteolysis and fibrinolysis in vessel walls.",

        "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major problem worldwide. Atherosclerosis and thrombosis underlying CAD involve multiple cell types. New and useful diagnostic markers are required. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate the gene expressions involved in various cellular processes. Endothelial dysfunction is implicated in early processes of athero-thrombosis. Thus, it was hypothesized that the level of vascular endothelium-enriched miRNAs would be altered in plasma samples of CAD patients.Vascular endothelium-enriched miRNA (miR-126) level was analyzed in plasma from 31 patients with CAD and 36 patients without CAD (qRT-PCR analysis).MiR-126 was not significantly down-regulated or up-regulated in CAD patients. Interestingly, the level of miR-126 was significantly decreased in patients with CAD and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level. In contrast, the level of miR-126 was significantly increased when LDL cholesterol was high in patients who had risk factors for CAD but did not have angiographically significant CAD.MiR-126 was not significantly down-regulated or up-regulated in CAD patients and was not suitable for discriminating CAD patients from patients without CAD. The oppositely-directed relationship between miR-126 and LDL cholesterol in patients with or without CAD may have significant implications for identifying a potential role of miR-126 in cholesterol metabolism.",

        "title": "Autophagy is activated in pancreatic cancer cells and correlates with poor patient outcome.",
        "abstract": "Because autonomous proliferating cancer cells are often exposed to hypoxic conditions, there must be an alternative metabolic pathway, such as autophagy, that allows them to obtain energy when both oxygen and glucose are depleted. We previously reported finding that autophagy actually contributes to cancer cell survival in colorectal cancers both in vitro and in vivo. Pancreatic cancer remains a devastating and poorly understood malignancy, and hypoxia in pancreatic cancers is known to increase their malignant potential. In the present study archival pancreatic cancer tissue was retrieved from 71 cases treated by curative pancreaticoduodenectomy. Autophagy was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining with anti-LC3 antibody, as LC3 is a key component of autophagy and has been used as a marker of autophagy. The results showed that strong LC3 expression in the peripheral area of pancreatic cancer tissue was correlated with a poor outcome (P = 0.0170) and short disease-free period (P = 0.0118). Two of the most significant correlations among the clinicopathological factors tested were found between the peripheral intensity level of LC3 expression and tumor size (P = 0.0098) or tumor necrosis (P = 0.0127). Activated autophagy is associated with pancreatic cancer cells, and autophagy is thought to be a response to factors in the cancer microenvironment, such as hypoxia and poor nutrient supply. This is the first study to report the clinicopathological significance of autophagy in pancreatic cancer.",

Although there is no interring hydrogen bond in galactinol, an indirect interring hydrogen bond including a water molecule is present. The observed conformation is additionally stabilized by the indirect interring hydrogen bond. The global minimum in the relaxed-residue energy map based on the MM3(92) force-field is close to the observed conformation in the crystal structure.

Early clinical trials with combined HER2-targeted therapies showed promising activities. However, it remains unclear whether HER2 amplification in mCRC is as prognostic as RAS or BRAF V600E mutant (mt). We aimed to evaluate survival outcome for mCRC pts with HER2 amplification compared to those with RAS or BRAF mt. Methods: mCRC pts who received a palliative resection of the primary tumor with metastatic diseases at presentation, or recurred after curative resection of the primary tumor between 2005 and 2015, were analyzed. HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections obtained from the primary tumor, and HER2 amplification was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in case of IHC 2+ or 3+. Criteria for HER2 amplification were a HER2- to CEP17- signal ratio of 2.0 or higher. RAS / BRAF status was cen...",

Our sample consists of 1229 university students from three developed and four developing countries. We construct  subjective social norms  ( SSN ) by interacting the perceived expectation to buy a car with motivation to comply with the expectation. Four approaches to incorporate social norms into OHCM are presented while controlling for other explanatory variables such as attitudes and socio-demographics. From the four estimated models we find that social norms significantly correlate with car purchase intention. Though differently defined in the four models, we find similar parameter estimates in all models, which leads us to conclude that the effect is fairly robust even with simplified definitions. From a model with person-group specific observed SSN, we further find though that group specific influences can differ significantly and that parents and university peers significantly influence car purchase intention.",

        "abstract": "Mouse allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) cDNA was cloned and the AIF-1-specific monoclonal antibodies were established to examine its tissue distribution. The mouse AIF-1 was highly conserved among all reported AIF-1 from a variety of species, from invertebrates to mammals, and the cloned cDNA was in good accordance with putative expressed regions of genomic sequences in the mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region. The messages of mouse AIF-1 were abundantly expressed in the testis, moderately in the spleen and lymph nodes and slightly in the liver and thymus of normal BALB/c mice. Immunohistological examination revealed that differentiating germ cells in the testis and presumably macrophages in the red pulp of the spleen were positive for AIF-1. To analyse the function of the AIF-1, a macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, was transfected with mouse AIF-1 cDNA. Upon stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, the transfectants that overexpressed AIF-1 showed marked morphological changes and produced significantly large amounts of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and IL-12p40 but not IL-12p70 compared with control cells. No difference was noted in production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta1 and IL-1alpha. These results suggest that AIF-1 plays an important role in cells of a monocyte/macrophage lineage upon stimulation with inflammatory stimuli by augmenting particular cytokine production.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Salivary gland carcinomas (SGCs) exhibit heterogeneous biological behaviors, including the formation of distant metastases, which is a critical event associated with poor prognosis. Ezrin, which is a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin family of plasma membrane–cytoskeleton linker proteins, may provide a marker for metastasis and poor survival of patients with cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between ezrin expression and the expression of HER2, p53, and Ki-67 as well as clinicopathological factors in SGCs. For this purpose, we used immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of these proteins in tissue microarrays prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumor tissues of 221 patients with SGCs. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, we determined cut-off values of 30% and 5.0% for high expression of ezrin and Ki-67, respectively. High ezrin expression detected in samples from 63 (28.5%) patients with SGCs significantly correlated with male sex, high-grade histopathology, high Ki-67 labeling index, HER2 overexpression, aberrant expression of p53, and distant metastasis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high ezrin expression was an independent prognostic factor for shorter overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.11 [1.09-4.05];  P =.027). Furthermore, concomitant high expression of ezrin and HER2 overexpression correlated significantly with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival as well as a high incidence of distant metastasis ( P",

        "abstract": "Microwave (MW) heating has received attention as a new heating source for various industrial processes. Some materials are expected to be a more effective absorber of MW, and graphite is observed as a possible candidate for high-temperature application. We investigated the dependence of the aspect ratio of graphite fibers on both their heating behavior and permittivity under a 2.45 GHz MW electric field. In these experiments, both loss tangent and MW heating behavior indicated that the MW absorption of conductive fibers increases with their aspect ratio. The MW absorption was found to be well accounted for by the application of a spheroidal model for a single fiber. The absorption of graphite fibers decreases with increasing aspect ratio when the long axis of the ellipsoid is perpendicular to the electric field, whereas it increases with the aspect ratio when the long axis is parallel to the electric field. The analytical model indicated that MW heating of the conductive fibers is expected to depend on both the shape and arrangement of the fibers in the electric field.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aims  A  is a slightly elevated flat lesion with wide pits occasionally observed at the margin of laterally spreading tumors (LSTs). However, the endoscopic treatment outcomes of LSTs with skirts have not been clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the endoscopic treatment outcomes of LSTs with skirts.  Methods  Between February 2006 and March 2014, 996 LSTs were retrospectively examined to assess the clinicopathologic characteristics, procedure time, en bloc resection rate, R0 resection rate, adverse events, and local recurrence rate of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and of endoscopic resection.  Results  Endoscopic treatment was performed in 35 cases of LSTs with skirts (ratio of ESD to endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection [EPMR], 32:3) and 961 cases of LSTs without skirts (ratio of ESD to EMR to EPMR to polypectomy, 381:275:114:191). LSTs with a skirt were associated with a significantly higher recurrence rate ( P  P  = .032, and odds ratio, 12.3;  P  = .061, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of the skirt and piecemeal resection were significant predictors of local recurrence.  Conclusions  LSTs with skirts had a significantly higher local recurrence rate after endoscopic treatment compared with LSTs without skirts, especially after EPMR. Therefore, ESD should be recommended as an endoscopic treatment for LSTs with skirts to minimize local recurrence.",

Here, we examined learning and memory and synaptic plasticity in mice with a null mutation of gene coding histamine H1 or H2 receptor in order to clarify the role of these receptors in learning and memory processes. Learning and memory were evaluated by several behavioral tasks including object recognition, Barnes maze and fear conditioning. These behavioral tasks are highly dependent on the function of prefrontal cortex, hippocampus or amygdala. Object recognition and Barnes maze performance were significantly impaired in both H1 receptor gene knockout (H1KO) and H2 receptor gene knockout (H2KO) mice when compared to the respective wild-type (WT) mice. Conversely, both H1KO and H2KO mice showed better auditory and contextual freezing acquisition than their respective WT mice. Furthermore, we also examined long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 area of hippocampus in H1KO and H2KO mice and their respective WT mice. LTP in the CA1 area of hippocampus was significantly reduced in both H1KO and H2KO mice when compared with their respective WT mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that both H1 and H2 receptors are involved in learning and memory processes for which the frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus interact.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:  αv integrins are a class of adhesion molecules which play a role in tumor progression and metastasis, and have been found to be highly expressed in various cancer types. A phase I/II study of anti-αv integrin antibody Abituzumab showed prolonged overall survival in the subgroup of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, in which tumor highly expressed αvs6. Here, we examined the expression of integrins in surgical resected specimens by immunohistochemistry and evaluated the relationship between integrin expression and clinicopathological features of Japanese patients with types of cancers which show high prevalence in Asian countries.  Materials and methods:  Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for integrin αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, αvβ8, pan-αv, and CD31 was conducted for formalin fixed paraffin embedded surgical specimen of Japanese patients with five different types of cancers, including gastric cancer (GC), esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC), biliary tract cancer (BTC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and CRC. All samples were collected at the National Cancer Research Center Hospital East between 2000 and 2014. The total number of samples was 250. Fifty samples of each cancer type were examined. IHC staining of each sample was evaluated by pathologists. Histoscores (H-score; range: 0 - 300) were used to describe the intensity and prevalence of signal. H-scores were determined separately for membrane and cytoplasm, both in tumor cells and normal adjacent cells.  Results:  Pan-αv expression patterns were found in most tumor cells of all tumor entities with a tendency towards moderate or strong staining. Expression of αvβ6 was observed in tumor cells of all tumor types other than HCC. Especially, BTC and ESCC tumor cells showed elevated intensity and higher prevalence of αvβ6 expression both in membranous and cytoplasmic compared to CRC tumor samples. In addition, BTC and ESCC tumor cells showed stronger intensity and higher proportion of αvβ6 compared to normal tissues. In CRC, the cases with higher expression of αvβ6 showed stronger tumor invasion or lymph node metastasis. In BTC and ESCC, high expression of αvβ6 was detected regardless of T-stage or lymph node metastasis status. ESCC cases with high expression of αvβ6 had a poor prognosis compared to cases with low expression.  Conclusions:  These data demonstrated that the expression of αvβ6 integrin correlated with clinicopathological features of BTC, ESCC, and CRC. High expression of αvβ6 in ESCC was associated with the poor prognosis. These data indicate that αv integrin may be an attractive target in cancer treatment.

        "abstract": "In CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices, long-term depression (LTD) was induced in the field EPSP response in the absence of test synaptic inputs (one stimulus every 20 s) by application of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, aminocyclopentane-1S, 3R-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD). This effect was blocked and long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by co-application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) during ACPD perfusion (ACPD/NMDA-induced LTD). These results indicate that the state of NMDA receptor activation during ACPD perfusion determines whether LTP or LTD is induced in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Co-application of an inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor inhibitor, 2-aminotheoxydiphenyl borate, during ACPD application had no effect on the ACPD/NMDA-induced LTP, but increased the magnitude of the ACPD-induced LTD, suggesting that the ACPD/NMDA-induced LTP involves NMDA receptors, but not IP3 receptors, whereas the converse applies to the ACPD-induced LTD.",

        "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO), a simple diatomic free radical, is known to play a critical physiological role in diverse organisms. An iron complex, with N-(dithiocarboxy)sarcosine (Fe-DTCS), has a high affinity for endogenous NO and can trap, stabilize, and accumulate it. The stable NO adduct thus formed is detectable at room temperature with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry. We report in vivo EPR imaging of endogenous NO, trapped by an Fe-DTCS complex, in the abdomen of a live mouse. To our knowledge, this is the first report on EPR imaging of endogenous free radicals produced in vivo. This EPR imaging method will be useful for the noninvasive investigation of the spatial distribution of NO in pathologic organs or tissues.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of CD133 expression in colorectal cancer, the distribution of CD133-positive cancer cells, and their relationship to clinicopathological features, including survival. An immunohistochemical examination of CD133 expression and a clinicopathological analysis were performed in the 189 consecutive colorectal cancer patients. CD133 expression was seen at the luminal surface of cancer glands mainly with cribriform features. Expression was detected in only 29 of the 189 tumors (15.3%). Of these, 21 tumors (11.1%) showed CD133 overexpression. All 21 tumors with CD133 overexpression were diagnosed as well- or moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma. There was no difference in the distribution of CD133 expressing cells between the invasive area and surface area. Although there was no difference in recurrence-free survival between patients with CD133 overexpression and without, the patients with CD133 overexpression had significantly poorer overall survival (P = 0.03). CD133 overexpression is a risk factor for poorer overall survival in patients with well- and moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Expression of this cancer-initiating cell marker may vary with the histological type of the cancer, and further investigation of the relationship between its expression and clinicopathological features may be necessary.",

In our previous work, we generated asymmetric lipid vesicles by deforming an asymmetric planar lipid bilayer using a pulsed jet flow. However, it was difficult to create various types or large amounts of the asymmetric lipid vesicles in a single double-well device. In this study, asymmetric planar lipid bilayers with multiple lipid components were formed by contacting various types of lipid monolayers using movable wells on a revolving table. We successfully produced two types of the asymmetric lipid vesicles containing red or green fluorescent lipids on the outer leaflet with a single device in a high-throughput manner using the proposed method. The asymmetricity of the generated vesicles was evaluated by the distribution of the fluorescence intensities. The proposed device will be applicable for generating artificial cell models with multiple asymmetric lipid components.",

This study aimed to identify differences in microenvironments of lung adenocarcinomas with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations by histological subtypes.The study cohort included 214 lung adenocarcinomas harboring EGFR mutations. We analyzed clinicopathological characteristics of lepidic (LPA), papillary (PPA), acinar (APA), and solid-predominant adenocarcinoma (SPA) subtypes, and examined expression levels of EGFR, E-cadherin, ezrin, laminin-5, ALDH1, and PD-L1 in cancer cells, and of CD34, CD204, podoplanin (PDPN), and FoxP3 in stromal cells in 4 subtypes (n=20 each).SPA displayed significantly more frequent lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, and worse prognosis than the other subtypes. Ezrin expression levels in SPA were also significantly higher than in LPA, PPA, or APA (P<0.05, all). Laminin-5 and PD-L1 expression levels in SPA were significantly higher than in LPA (P<0.01 for both) and PPA (P<0.01 for both) and tended to be higher than in APA (laminin-5: P=0.096, PD-L1: P=0.081). Furthermore, SPA displayed higher levels of PDPN (+) cancer-associated fibroblasts (P<0.01) and CD204 (+) tumor-associated macrophages (P<0.05) than the other subtypes.Compared with other predominant subtypes with EGFR mutations, the microenvironment of SPA with EGFR mutations is characterized by cancer cells with higher invasive and immune evasion potential and more abundant stromal cells with tumor-promoting functions, which would contribute to the more aggressive behavior of SPA.",

        "abstract": "An injection-locked magnetron with an external oscillator was investigated to obtain the parameters of the equivalent circuit model. The magnetron was locked over the ratio of the input power to output power of −26 dB and had the resonance characteristics of a parallel LCR circuit model. Increasing the input power caused the anti-resonance frequency to become the original frequency of the magnetron; the range of the locking frequency was wider because of the lower Q value. The phase noise of the locked magnetron of −70 dBc at a 40-kHz offset was improved in comparison with an unlocked magnetron. The results show that an injection-locked magnetron with an external oscillator has great potential for obtaining a high power output.",

        "abstract": "Coronary endothelial function is impaired in hypertension; however, the severity of this impairment varies among patients. We aimed to identify the predictors of coronary endothelial dysfunction among clinical variables related to hypertension and atherosclerosis. Twenty-seven untreated, uncomplicated essential hypertensive patients and 10 age-matched healthy controls were studied prospectively. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured by using (15)O-water positron emission tomography (PET) at rest and during a cold pressor test (CPT). Coronary vascular resistance (CVR) during CPT was used as a marker of coronary endothelial function. Serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, malondialdehyde-LDL, homeostasis model assessment, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were also measured. CVR during CPT was significantly higher in hypertensive patients than in healthy controls (114+/-26 vs. 94+/-12 mmHg/[mL/g/min]; p<0.05). By univariate analysis, CVR during CPT was correlated with LDL cholesterol (r=0.38, p<0.05), IL-6 (r=0.46, p<0.02), and TNF-alpha (r=0.39, p<0.05) in hypertensive patients. By multivariate analysis, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were significant independent predictors of CVR during CPT. Elevated plasma IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were independent predictors of coronary endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients. These results suggest that plasma IL-6 and TNF-alpha might be useful for identifying the high risk subgroup of hypertensive patients with coronary endothelial dysfunction and provide an important clue to link systemic inflammation to the development of coronary atherosclerosis.",

To determine the role of PAI-1 in vascular wall, we have used a novel inhibitor of PAI-1, (3E, 4E)-3-benzylidene-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzylidene) -pyrrolidine-2,5-dione (T-686). T-686 was given to human vascular endothelial cells in vitro and to rabbits subjected to high cholesterol diet and mechanical injury in vivo. T-686 attenuated the augmentation of PAI-1 antigen accumulation induced by transforming growth factor beta in conditioned medium from the human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In rabbits with aortic atherosclerosis induced by hypercholesterolemia and implantation of indwelling plastic tubing, oral administration of T-686 (30mg/kg body weight/day) for 8 weeks attenuated the increase in plasma PAI-1 activity induced by vascular injury without decreasing blood triglyceride and cholesterol. This was accompanied by the reduction in aortic PAI-1 mRNA expression and the inhibition of development of atherosclerosis lesions. Thus, T-686 not only decreased PAI-1 synthesis in vascular cells in vitro but also protected against the development of vascular lesions in vivo. This compound may be useful in defining the role of PAI-1 in atherothrombotic states.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes automation of planar lipid bilayer formation by introducing a stepping motor to a microfluidic device. Planar lipid bilayers or lipid vesicles are useful to understand biological reactions and to investigate the interaction between lipids and proteins. Therefore, to acquire large amount of the information, high-throughput production of planar lipid bilayers or giant vesicles (GVs) is necessary. The droplet split-and-contact method, which enhances the efficiencies of both planar lipid bilayer formation and GV generation, needs to be automated for increasing the throughput. Previous droplet split-and-contact devices were manipulated manually; hence, the influence of manipulation on planar lipid bilayer formation was not evaluated quantitatively. First, to develop an automated system for generating asymmetric planar lipid bilayers, a stepping motor, which allows to control the angular speed of the rotor, is integrated into the droplet split- and-contact device (Fig. $1(\\mathrm{b)$). Next, we assessed planar lipid bilayer generation at various angular speeds and found the speed limit for bilayer formation. Finally, we generated asymmetric planar lipid bilayers that have different lipid composition on outer and inner leaflets using this automated device and confirmed the asymmetry of the planar lipid bilayers by generating GVs.",

        "abstract": "PIK3CA mutations are expected to be potential therapeutic targets for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We aimed to clarify the concordance between PIK3CA mutations detected in endoscopic biopsy specimens and corresponding surgically resected specimens. We examined five hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene (E542K, E545K, E546K, H1047R, and H1047L) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of paired endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from 181 patients undergoing curative resection for ESCC between 2000 and 2011 using a Luminex technology-based multiplex gene mutation detection kit. Mutation analyses were successfully performed for both endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens in all the cases. A PIK3CA mutation was detected in either type of specimen in 13 cases (7.2%, 95% confidence interval: 3.9–12.0). The overall concordance rate, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.3% (178/181), 90.9% (10/11), and 98.8% (168/170), respectively. Among patients with a PIK3CA mutation detected in both types of specimens, the concordance between PIK3CA mutation genotypes was 100%. There were three cases with a discordant mutation status between the types of specimens (PIK3CA mutation in surgically resected specimen and wild-type in biopsy specimen in two cases, and the opposite pattern in one case), suggesting possible intratumoral heterogeneity in the PIK3CA mutation status. The PIK3CA mutation status was highly concordant between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from the same patient, suggesting that endoscopic biopsy specimens can be clinically used to detect PIK3CA mutations in patients with ESCC.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is one of the major causes of death. Data from animal experiments suggest that atherosclerosis involves an inflammatory process of the vascular wall under hyperlipidemia. Atherothrombosis can become a serious complication of atherosclerosis leading to acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Clinical applications to use this knowledge remain scarce. The plasma levels of vascular endothelium-enriched microRNA (miRNAs) in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease could serve as a disease marker. In our laboratory vascular endothelium-enriched miRNA (miR-126) level was analyzed using quantitative RT polymerase chain reaction analysis (qRT-PCR) in plasma from patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) according to the chest symptom or findings of electrocardiogram, or middle-aged male smokers. Endothelial function for peripheral small vessels was assessed using End-PAT 2000 and expressed as reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) index. In patients with suspected CAD miR-126 was not significantly changed in CAD patients. However, miR-126 was decreased in CAD patients who also have high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Interestingly, miR-126 was increased when LDL cholesterol was high in patients who did not have evident CAD on coronary angiography even though they have risk factors for CAD. In smokers serum cotinine levels were inversely correlated with endothelial function expressed as RH-PAT index and positively correlated with levels of metabolic parameters such as non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and insulin resistance. More than half of the smokers could not completely attain smoking cessation and, thus, the RH-PAT index was not improved 8 weeks after the instruction of smoking cessation. However, changes in the RH-PAT index showed a significant correlation with those in systolic blood pressure. In smokers who completely attained smoking cessation, both RH-PAT index and plasma miR-126 values were increased. Thus, among patients with suspected CAD or subjects with coronary risk factors plasma levels of endothelium-enriched circulating miR-126 could be substantially altered. The results suggest a potential usefulness of miR-126 as a sensitive biomarker in assessing endothelial damage. Measurement of microRNA may serve as a useful tool for laboratory assays to determine high-risk patients for atherothromobotic vascular diseases.",

To clarify the difference in change of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) corresponding to induction of LTP or LTD, we measured [Ca2+]i during the perfusion of ATP or ATP+AP5, while simultaneously recording evoked field potentials. In both cases, ATP (or ATP+AP5) perfusion transiently increased [Ca2+]i but the extent of increase of [Ca2+]i by ATP was larger than that caused by ATP+AP5. Thus, the larger rise in [Ca2+]i induces LTP but the smaller rise induces LTD. These results are consistent with the Ca2+ hypothesis as proposed by Lisman (Trends Neurosci. 17 (1994) 406).",

        "abstract": "The potential use of assays of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide for detection of diastolic abnormalities associated with alterations in blood pressure has not been elucidated. This study was designed to determine whether increased plasma concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide sensitively reflect abnormal diastolic function associated with hypertension.Concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in plasma were assayed in 40 previously untreated hypertensive patients without overt congestive heart failure and in 20 age and sex-matched controls. Hypertensive patients were studied with the use of pulsed Doppler and color M-mode Doppler echocardiography for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function.Concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were elevated in hypertensive patients [75.1+/-75.2 (SD) pg/ml compared with 37.9+/-38.5 in controls, P<0.05]. In hypertensive patients, concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were negatively correlated with the ratio of color M-mode flow propagation velocity to transmitral E velocity consistent with the view that increased concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide are indicative of alterations in diastolic function. Hypertensive patients with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide values above the mean value in the control group exhibited significantly increased brachial intimal-medial thickness and reduced wall stress, consistent with the view that increased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was associated with favorable peripheral arterial remodeling.Elevated concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in plasma reflect the presence of left ventricular diastolic abnormalities and peripheral arterial remodeling in asymptomatic patients with hypertension.",

This study was designed to determine which properties of nonionic contrast media were potentially responsible for this action. Platelet aggregation after adenosine diphosphate stimulation was studied in the platelet rich plasma obtained from 37 patients who underwent left ventriculography using the highly sensitive method of particle counting with laser-light scattering. Platelet activation by contrast media was studied in the platelet rich plasma from healthy volunteers using flow cytometric analysis to detect platelet degranulation as P-selectin expression. There was a significant decrease in platelet aggregation in patients injected with ioxilan or iomeprol compared with patients injected with iohexol. There was a significant increase in P-selectin expression with the three groups of contrast media compared to control. The platelet activation with ioxilan or iomeprol was significantly less compared to the activation with iohexol. The comparison showed that previous generalization regarding platelet activation by nonionic contrast media might not be valid. It is presumed that the higher osmolality of iohexol may contribute to the increase in platelet aggregation and activation.",

        "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is well known to have a wide variety of biological and physiological functions in animals. On the basis of the fact that Fe(II)-dithiocarbamates react with NO, a Fe(II)-N-(dithiocarboxy)sarcosine complex (Fe(II)-DTCS) was proposed as a trapping agent for endogenous NO. However, quantitative pharmacokinetic investigation for NO-Fe(II)-dithiocarbamate complexes in experimental animals has been quite limited. This paper describes the results on the quantitative pharmacokinetic features of a NO-Fe(II)-N-DTCS in both the blood and bile of rats following intravenous (i.v.) administration of the complex. For this purpose, we applied two in vivo methods, i.e. (1) in vivo blood circulation monitoring-electron spin resonance (BCM-ESR) which previously developed, and (2) in vivo biliary excretion monitoring-electron spin resonance (BEM-ESR). We monitored real-time ESR signals due to nitrosyl-iron species in the circulating blood and bile flow. The ESR signal due to NO-Fe(II)-DTCS was stable in biological systems such as the fresh blood and bile. In in vivo BCM- and BEM-ESR, the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated on the basis of the two-compartment and hepatobiliary transport models. The studies also revealed that the compound is widely distributed in the peripheral organs and partially excreted into the bile. We named a kinetic method to follow spin concentrations as spinnokinetics and this method will be useful for detecting and quantifying the endogenously generated NO in Fe(II)-DTCS administered animals.",

        "abstract": "Proteolysis, modulated in part by intramural fibrinolytic system proteins and their inhibitors, appears to influence vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM). Alterations of fibrinolysis in circulating blood and of proteolysis within vessel walls in experimental animals and patients with diabetes have been associated with accelerated vascular disease. Hyaluronan, a prominent component of ECM in normal vessels, is increased in the tunica media of macroscopically normal arterial vessels from patients with type 2 diabetes.To determine whether hyaluronan alters the expression of the fibrinolytic system protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), in human vascular SMCs, thereby potentially accelerating vascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.Urokinase-type and tissue-type plasminogen activators (uPA and tPA) and PAI-1 were assayed in vascular SMC conditioned media and in cell lysates, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting.Hyaluronan increased the 24-h release of PAI-1 into conditioned media in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner (1.8-fold compared with control with 1 mg/ml hyaluronan; n = 9, P < 0.01). Although the accumulation of uPA in conditioned media tended to increase also, uPA content was reduced in cell lysates (64% of control with 0.1 mg/ml hyaluronan at 24 h; n = 9, P < 0.01) without any change in PAI-1. Concentrations of tPA in conditioned media and cell lysates were unchanged. Digestion of hyaluronan with hyaluronidase (50 turbidity reducing units (TRU)/ml) or exposure of the smooth muscle cells to antihuman CD44 antibody (1 microgram/ml) that binds to the hyaluronan cell surface receptor obviated the effects of hyaluronan.Our results indicate that increases in hyaluronan increase vascular SMC expression of PAI-1, a phenomenon that may alter the balance between proteolysis and its inhibition in vessels of patients with type 2 diabetes, thereby contributing to the acceleration of macroangiopathy.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of chemotherapy with irinotecan plus docetaxel were retrospectively evaluated for olfactory neuroblastoma.Twelve patients with histologically proven advanced or metastatic olfactory neuroblastoma were treated with chemotherapy with irinotecan plus docetaxel at the study institution between 2001 and 2005. Of these, 7 patients with locoregional disease and no prior radiotherapy received irinotecan plus docetaxel followed by definitive radiotherapy, 1 with photon radiotherapy and 6 with proton radiotherapy, whereas 3 patients with distant metastases and 2 with locoregional disease who had received prior radiotherapy received irinotecan plus docetaxel only.The most common toxicities of >or=grade 3 among the 12 patients receiving irinotecan plus docetaxel were leukopenia (33%), neutropenia (50%), febrile neutropenia (8%), and diarrhea (25%), all of which were manageable. Partial response was achieved in 3 patients, giving an overall response rate of 25%. The response rate was higher in patients aged <50 years (3 of 4 patients) compared with those aged >50 years (0 of 8 patients) (P = .018). With a median follow-up period of 22.2 months, the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 13.6 months and 36.6 months, respectively. Of the 7 patients with locoregional disease also receiving definitive radiotherapy, the 2-year survival rate was 100% and 6 patients were alive at the time of last follow-up.Chemotherapy for olfactory neuroblastoma with irinotecan plus docetaxel is safe and manageable. Patients aged <50 years may be sensitive to chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy followed by definitive radiotherapy may represent a promising option for patients with locally advanced olfactory neuroblastoma.",

This study focused on students’ intention to purchase different types of vehicles. The study obtained a sample of 1,229 students from seven countries, to understand cultural differences in preferences. The dependent variables were intention to buy cars in different categories, including hybrid and electric cars. The aim was to explain intentions with three categories of explanatory variables: psychological aspects, sociodemographics, and site-specific dummy variables. To account for correlation between the dependent variables, the analysis used seemingly unrelated regression.

Thus, it may be an ideal model for seeking a marker of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) based on their morphology. Using the human SCC cell line A431, we found that, as a paradigm of cancer stem cells: (1) podoplanin(+) cells generate both podoplanin(+) and podoplanin(-) cells; (2) podoplanin(-) cells rarely generate podoplanin(+) cells; (3) podoplanin(+) cells have higher colony formation efficiency and tumorigenicity than podoplanin(-) cells; (4) localization and morphology of podoplanin(+) cells in a xenografted tumor derived from podoplanin(+) cells are similar with those in human oral SCC tissue or normal epithelium. Furthermore, podoplanin(+) A431 cells share sonic hedgehog and CD44 expression with stem cells in normal squamous epithelium. Hence, we concluded that podoplanin is a novel marker to enrich TICs with stem-cell-like properties from SCC cell line A431.",

The conducted experiments indicated   different orders of magnitude than the drying furnace process in the water evaporation rate; moreover, the water vapor   rate increased in accordance with the microwave power. The microwave absorption properties indicated that microwave   selectively heated water into vaporized moisture, and the vaporization conformed to an energy balance between water   evaporative latent heat and microwave power. Furthermore, soil-aggregating agents showed minimal effects on the   vapor rate at low microwave power, whereas sand deposited with an aggregating agent indicated a higher vapor rate   than that without an agent at a high microwave power. When sufficient energy was supplied to moisture, water transfer   was dominant in the vaporization process. In this case, the soil-aggregating agents significantly affected the efficiency   of the vaporization process.",

        "abstract": "The concentrations in blood of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), an inhibitor of fibrinolysis and proteolysis, are elevated in obese and insulin-resistant subjects, predispose them to the risk of thrombosis, and may accelerate atherogenesis. Adipose tissue is a prominent source. Accordingly, intracellular signaling pathways that may influence PAI-1 expression in adipocytes have been the focus of considerable study. Rho, a small GTP binding and GTPase protein, when activated in turn activates its target, Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein, to yield an active kinase, Rho-kinase, an effector in the Rho pathway. Rho-kinase exerts calcium-sensitizing effects in vascular smooth muscle cells and inhibitory effects on transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) expression in chicken embryonic heart cells. Because TGF-beta is a powerful agonist of PAI-1 expression, we characterized the effects of inhibition of Rho-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. PAI-1 mRNA was determined by Northern blotting, and PAI-1 protein was determined by Western blotting. The Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 [(R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide], increased PAI-1 expression markedly. Although genistein, a flavonoid tyrosine kinase, attenuated the increase of PAI-1 induced by Y-27632, other non-flavonoid tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not. However, another flavonoid, daidzein, which lacks tyrosine kinase activity, decreased basal PAI-1 expression and attenuated the induction of PAI-1 expression by Y-27632. Thus, the Rho/Rho-kinase system inhibits PAI-1 expression by a flavonoid-sensitive mechanism in adipocytes. Therefore, flavonoids may be useful in decreasing elevated PAI-1 expression in adipose tissue and its consequent pathophysiologic sequelae.",

In this study, the motorcycle lanes are divided into three types, exclusive, inclusive, and paved shoulder. This study examined the correlations between motorcyclists’ psychological factors and their risky riding behaviors (speeding and neglecting to wear helmet), depending on self-reported usage of different types of motorcycle facilities. The psychological factors discussed in this study were: attitude, desire, perceived behavior control, moral obligation, perceived danger, fear of being caught, and perception of others’ behaviors toward the risky behaviors. Quantitative analyses, including Structural Equation Modeling, were used as the analytical tools. The results demonstrated the statistically significant relationship of exclusive road lanes’ usage on speeding behavior. However, no statistically significant correlation was found for segregated lanes’ usage on helmet wearing behavior. Psychological factors were found affecting the motorcyclists’ likelihood of performing the risky behaviors. However, these factors influence speeding and helmet wearing behavior differently. The study offers recommendations and theoretical contributions to explain the complex relationships among the uses of segregated lanes, riders’ psychological factors, and their risky behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Action potentials are fundamental to relaying information from region to region in the nervous system. Changes in action potential firing patterns in neural circuits influence how the brain processes information. In our previous study, we focused on interneuron/perineuronal astrocyte pairs in the hippocampal CA1 region and reported that direct depolarization of perineuronal astrocytes modulated the firing pattern of interneurons. In the current study, we investigated the morphological and electrophysiological properties of perineuronal oligodendrocytes, and examined their modulatory effects on interneuronal firing in the CA1 region. Perineuronal oligodendrocytes only had a few processes, which were crooked, intricately twisted, and twined around the soma and proximal region of the main processes of adjacent interneurons. Whole-cell current patterns of perineuronal oligodendrocytes were homogenous and the current-voltage relationship showed remarkable outward rectification. Although the K channel blockers, tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine, clearly blocked outward currents, Ba did not significantly alter whole-cell currents. Unlike perineuronal astrocytes, the depolarization of perineuronal oligodendrocytes had no effect on interneuronal firing; however, when the interneurons were firing at a higher frequency, the hyperpolarization of perineuronal oligodendrocytes suppressed their action potentials. The suppressive effects of perineuronal oligodendrocytes were inhibited in the presence of a low concentration of tetraethylammonium, which selectively blocked deep and fast afterhyperpolarization. These results suggest that perineuronal oligodendrocytes suppress interneuronal firing through their influence on K channels, which are responsible for deep and fast afterhyperpolarization.",

SDC pellets were annealed in various atmospheres, and a peak intensity of a Raman band of SDC in the range 540–600 cm −1 , which has been assigned to a band that originates in the oxygen vacancies, increased with decreasing oxygen partial pressure [ P (O 2 )] upon annealing. A clear relationship between the peak area of the oxygen-vacancy band and P (O 2 ) upon annealing was obtained. This relationship was used to determine the profile of oxygen partial pressure, P (O 2 ), in SDC located between fuel and air. The experimental profile was in good agreement with that obtained theoretically. The profile revealed that most part of SDC was mixed conductive and only a thin layer adjacent to the air side remained purely ionic conductive under the open-circuit conditions of SOFCs.",

        "abstract": "Delayed cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is the most negative prognostic factor of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This study analyzed the relationship between clinicopathologic factors, including anatomic invasive depth (AID), and CLNM. A total of 212 patients with clinically node-negative (cN0) tongue SCC who had undergone partial glossectomy through the mouth were eligible for this retrospective study. The deepest portions where tongue SCC cells invaded as determined by microscopic analyses were classified into 5 categories, including epithelial and submucosal tissue, lateral extrinsic tongue muscle (ETM), intrinsic tongue muscles (ITM), paralingual and sublingual spaces, and medial ETM according to AID. We examined the relationship between clinicopathologic factors including AID and delayed CLNM. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that AID was an independent predictive factor for delayed CLNM (P=0.0022; odds ratio=7.1). Deeper invasion than ITM, including ITM, paralingual and sublingual spaces, and medial ETM, had high sensitivity and negative predictive value for delayed CLNM (94.4% and 95.7%, respectively). Precise elucidation of AID may be useful for the preoperative decision for performing elective neck dissection. None of 11 patients in whom the deepest portion where tumor invaded to lateral ETM (according to AID) showed delayed CLNM, although tongue SCC T4a tumor is defined by the presence of invasion of cancer cells to ETM. Tumors with invasion to lateral ETM might have to be excluded from the pathologic T4a category.",

        "abstract": "Insulin increases, through several molecular mechanisms, expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the major physiologic inhibitor of fibrinolysis. This phenomenon has been implicated as a cause of accelerated coronary artery disease and the increased incidence of acute coronary syndromes associated with type 2 diabetes. We have previously reported that physiologic and pharmacologic concentrations of insulin induce PAI-1 synthesis in human HepG2 cells and that simvastatin can attenuate its effects. This study was performed to further elucidate mechanisms responsible for the insulin-induced PAI-1 production.Concentrations of PAI-1 mRNA were determined by real-time PCR, and PAI-1 protein was assayed by western blotting. PAI-1 promoter (-829 to +36 bp) activity was assayed with the use of luciferase reporter assays. The potential role of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) in the PAI-1 gene was assayed with the use of luciferase constructs containing the 3'-UTR. Oxidative stress was measured by loading cells with carboxy-2,7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein.Insulin increased PAI-1 promoter activity, PAI-1 mRNA, and accumulation of PAI-1 protein in the conditioned media. Insulin-inducible PAI-1 promoter activity was attenuated by simvastatin. Experiments performed with luciferase reporters containing the 3'-UTR showed that insulin increased luciferase activity through this region. Insulin also increased oxidative stress. Both insulin-inducible luciferase activity through the 3'-UTR and oxidative stress were attenuated by simvastatin.Insulin can increase PAI-1 expression through multiple mechanisms including induction mediated by the 3'-UTR of the PAI-1 gene. Accordingly, beneficial pleiotropic effects of statins on coronary artery disease may be attributable, in part, to attenuation of overexpression of PAI-1 mediated by the 3'-UTR in syndromes of insulin resistance (such as the metabolic syndrome) and type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Pathogenetic effects of active immune cell products on the coagulation and fibrinolytic system proteins in liver and endothelial cells--primary sites of synthesis of these proteins--have not been elucidated.We incubated highly differentiated human hepatoma cells (Hep G2) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for 24 h with recombinant human leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM)--cytokines that are implicated in acute phase reactions during inflammation and which bind to the same cell surface receptor unit (glycoprotein gp 130). LIF was also given to mice in vivo. Contents of coagulation and fibrinolytic system proteins in cell culture supernatants and in mouse liver were determined.LIF increased the accumulation of urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) in the Hep G2 cell culture supernatants determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (0.21 +/- 0.03 (SE) ng/ml at baseline; 0.40 +/- 0.05 ng/ml at 100 U/ml, P < 0.05; 0.57 +/- 0.06 ng/ml at 500 U/ml, P < 0.01; n = 9) without altering total protein content. OSM elicited a similar effect (0.25 +/- 0.04 ng/ml at baseline, 0.62 +/- 0.19 ng/ml at 1 ng/ml; P < 0.05, n = 6). A monoclonal antibody against gp 130 abrogated the response to both agents (n = 9). Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) (assayed by ELISA, n = 9), the PAI-1 binding protein, vitronectin (immunoprecipitation, n = 3) and tissue factor (ELISA, n = 3) were not affected by LIF, but fibrinogen production increased up to twofold with LIF (500 U/ml; Western blot, n= 3). In HUVECs, synthesis of tissue type plasminogen activator or PAI-1 was not altered by LIF or OSM (ELISA, n = 9). In vivo, intraperitoneal recombinant murine LIF (2 mu g) increased liver concentrations of u-PA by 30% and fibrinogen by 220% in mice.LIF and OSM produced by immune cells may modify fibrinolysis and coagulation by altering expression of u-PA and fibrinogen, thereby contributing to coagulopathy.",

The aim was to explore the histology of squamous epithelial precursor lesions and superficial-type pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (STPSCC), including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ and early invasive SCC, by focusing on microvascular irregularities to investigate the composition of those lesions and to explore the pathological characteristics of STPSCCs.Several pathological factors including thickness of intraepithelial squamous cell carcinoma (IESCC) and tumour thickness and microvascular density (MVD) were examined in 104 STPSCCs from 69 patients. The results show that architectural change of IPCL was recognized in precursor lesions in parallel with architectural disturbance and cytological atypia for criteria of diagnosing dysplasia. In 104 STPSCCs, the MVD of IESCC was correlated with the thickness of IESCC (P = 0.0115). Moreover, invasive SCC showed significantly higher MVD of IESCC (P = 0.0078) and there was significant correlation between the thickness of IESCC and subepithelial invasion (P < 0.0001).Microvascular irregularities are an important pathological factor in carcinogenesis and early invasiveness of SCC of the pharynx.",

        "abstract": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) plays an integral role not only in the regulation of fibrinolytic activity but also in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and hypertension. We investigated the signaling pathways of angiotensin II (Ang II) leading to PAI-1 gene expression. Ang II increased the PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner through the Ang II type 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells. PAI-1 gene promoter activity measured by luciferase assay was significantly increased by Ang II. PAI-1 mRNA stability was also increased by Ang II. Ang II-induced PAI-1 mRNA upregulation was inhibited by BAPTA-AM, genistein, and AG1478, suggesting that intracellular calcium, tyrosine kinase, and epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation are involved. Furthermore, PD98059, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), almost completely suppressed Ang II-induced PAI-1 upregulation. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the dominant-negative form of Rho-kinase or Y27632, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, also completely prevented PAI-1 induction by Ang II without affecting Ang II-induced ERK activation. These data suggest that activation of MEK/ERK and Rho-kinase pathways plays a pivotal role in PAI-1 gene upregulation by Ang II. The Rho-kinase pathway may be a novel target to inhibit Ang II signaling, and its inhibition may be useful in the treatment of hypertension as well as atherosclerosis.",

The chamber device is composed of microperforated polytetrafluoroethylene thin film, and two magnetic rings that work as both electrodes and the chamber walls. Comparing to conventional open chamber devices for BLM formation that is based on droplet contact method, our approach can reduce the water depth, and it becomes that much easier to access the BLM via liquid ab extra. We confirmed that the formed membrane was BLM using membrane protein that made nanopore in BLMs. In addition, gas chromatographic analyses implied that adsorption of odorant into the buffer solution was more effective at shallower water level than deep position. We expect that this shallow chamber is potentially useful for odorant sensing based on olfactory receptors reconstructed in BLMs.",

        "abstract": "Our group has recently reported that in the immortal human HepG2 liver cell line, sphingosine 1‑phosphate (S1P) increases transcription of plasminogen activator inhibitor type‑1 (PAI‑1), the major physiological inhibitor of fibrinolysis, within 4 h. The present study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect. PAI‑1 expression was measured by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. It was demonstrated that S1P increased PAI‑1 promoter activity but did not increase the activity of promoters lacking the hypoxia responsive element (HRE) 2. In addition, S1P transiently increased the concentration of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)‑1α, a transcription factor capable of binding to HRE. When HIF‑1α was knocked down, the induction of transcription of PAI‑1 by S1P was no longer observed. Sphingosine kinase (SPHK) activity is increased by hypoxia. It was demonstrated that increases in the concentration of the HIF‑1α protein induced by hypoxia were prevented by treatment with SPHK inhibitor or S1P receptor antagonists. Thus, modification of the induction of HIF‑1α by S1P, leading to increased transcription of PAI‑1, may be an attractive therapeutic target for thrombosis and consequent inhibition of fibrinolysis associated with hypoxia.

We reported that narrow-band imaging (NBI) endoscopy can detect superficial pharyngeal cancer, and these lesions can be treated endoscopically.To assess the safety and long-term efficacy of transoral organ-preserving pharyngeal endoscopic resection (TOPER) for superficial pharyngeal cancer.Retrospective 2-center cohort study.The study included 104 consecutive patients with superficial pharyngeal cancer.TOPER with the patients under general anesthesia.Safety of the procedure, long-term survival, clinical outcome.A total of 148 consecutive lesions were resected in 104 patients. There was no severe adverse event. Temporary tracheostomy was required in 17 patients (16%) to prevent airway obstruction. The median fasting period and hospital stay after TOPER were 2 days (range 1-20 days) and 8 days (range 3-58 days), respectively. Ninety-six patients (92%) had no local recurrence or distant metastases. Local recurrence at the primary site developed in 6 patients, but all were resolved by repeat TOPER. With a median follow-up period of 43 months (range 3-96 months), the overall survival rate at 5 years was 71% (95% CI, 59-82). Cause-specific survival rate at 5 years was 97% (95% CI, 93-100). The cumulative development rate of multiple cancers in pharyngeal mucosal sites at 5 years was 22% (95% CI, 12-33). The pharynx was preserved in all patients, and they experienced no loss of function.Retrospective design.Peroral endoscopic resection of superficial pharyngeal cancer is a feasible and effective treatment with curative intent.",

For this, the authors considered some psychological factors that may make impacts on PBS useru0027s attitudes and hypothesized especially that individual environmental concern refers to an attitude toward environmental issues, influence an increase of their perceived value of PBS. The Norm Activation Model (NAM) is used to measure the publicu0027s environmental concern incorporating norm activation. In addition, willingness to pay (WTP) method is adopted to investigate the value of PBS individuals. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that environmental concern influenced peopleu0027s perception of the value of PBS.

A population-based approach aimed at decreasing high blood pressure among the general population is an important component of any comprehensive plan to prevent hypertension. However, few studies have investigated generational differences in knowledge about, and consciousness of, hypertension. Thus, we conducted a questionnaire survey about hypertension, with the aim of clarifying differences of understanding about hypertension between high school students and elderly people. The results of this investigation suggested that there is indeed a generational difference: knowledge about hypertension, and awareness of its relationship with salt intake, was higher in elderly people than in high school students. Furthermore, our study showed that among high school students, salt intake consciousness correlated with a family history of hypertension. By contrast, in elderly people, salt intake consciousness is related to age and to an awareness of recommended daily salt intake. This study strongly showed that knowledge and consciousness of hypertension varied among generations, with the elderly being more aware and conscientious about salt intake. Acknowledgement of this generational diversity is critical to developing an effective overall preventive strategy for hypertension.",

Low frequency stimulation (LFS) consisting of 450 pulses at 1 Hz induced LTD (-14.3%, mean, n = 10) in the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential. SKF-38393 (3-10 microM), an agonist of DA D1 receptors, significantly enhanced LFS-induced LTD (-31.1%, n = 11). SCH-23390 (2 microM), an antagonist of DA D1 receptors, blocked the induction of LTD by LFS (2.5%, n = 6). These results indicate that DA D1 receptors play an important role in the modulation of LFS-induced LTD in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons.",

        "abstract": "The effects of the adenosine A2 receptor antagonist CP-66713 on the reversal of long-term potentiation (LTP) were studied in CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices. Reduction of LTP (depotentiation, DP) was effected by delivering a train of low-frequency afferent stimuli (depotentiation stimulation, DPS) which was given 20 min after tetanus (100 Hz, 100 pulses). DPS (1 Hz, 1000 pulses) was applied during perfusion of CP-66713 (10 microM). In the presence of CP-66713, DPS reduced the potentiated component of the slope of the field EPSP (S-EPSP) and the amplitude of the population spike (A-PS) by 101.7% and 19.1% of the potentiated amount, respectively (mean, n = 8). The reduction of LTP of the S-EPSP was significantly larger than the control (68.5% (mean, n = 6)) while that of the A-PS was significantly smaller than the control (80.1% (mean, n = 6)). Based on these results, we conclude that the inhibition of DP in the EPSP, the facilitation of DP in the PS, and the consequent attenuation in the EPSP-PS relationship follow from activation of adenosine A2 receptors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT  Amphibians provide an ideal model to study the actions of thyroid hormone (TH) in animal development because TH signaling via two TH receptors, TRα and TRβ, is indispensable for amphibian metamorphosis. However, specific roles for the TRβ isoform in metamorphosis are poorly understood. To address this issue, we generated  trβ- disrupted  Xenopus tropicalis  tadpoles using the CRISPR-Cas system .  We first established a highly efficient and rapid workflow for gene disruption in the founder generation (F0) by injecting sgRNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. Most embryos showed severe mutant phenotypes carrying high somatic mutation rates. Utilizing this founder analysis system, we examined the role of  trβ  in metamorphosis.  trβ -disrupted pre-metamorphic tadpoles exhibited mixed responsiveness to exogenous TH. Specifically, gill resorption and activation of several TH-response genes, including  trβ  itself and two protease genes, were impaired. However, hind limb outgrowth and induction of the TH-response genes,  klf9  and  fra-2 , were not affected by loss of  trβ . Surprisingly,  trβ- disrupted tadpoles were able to undergo spontaneous metamorphosis normally, except for a slight delay in tail resorption. These results indicate TRβ is not required but contributes to the timing of resorptive events of metamorphosis.",

        "abstract": "1. Temperature-dependent properties of synaptic transmission were studied by recording orthodromic responses of the population spike and excitatory postsynaptic potential in CA1 pyramidal neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices. 2. Increasing the temperature of the perfusing medium from 30 to 43 degrees C resulted in a decrease in the amplitude of the population spike (A-PS) and a reduced slope of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (S-EPSP). Bath application of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist, picrotoxin, or a change in the calcium concentration of the perfusate did not affect the A-PS during heating. 3. Increasing the strength of the synaptic input to that eliciting a PS with an amplitude 50, 75, or 100% of maximal at 30 degrees C resulted in a significant increase in the A-PS during the middle phase of hyperthermia (35-39 degrees C). 4. The long-term potentiation (LTP) induced at either 30 or 37 degrees C showed the same percentage increase in both the amplitude of the population spike and the S-EPSP after delivery of a tetanus (100 Hz. 100 pulses) to CA1 synapses. 5. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate that the decrease in CA1 field potential was linearly related to the temperature of the slice preparation, while LTP was induced in these responses during heating from 30 to 37 degrees C.",

        "abstract": "Migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are hallmarks of atherogenesis and restenosis after angioplasty. Digestion of surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) may be a critical link. To determine whether invasion of ECM by human aortic SMCs (HASMCs) depends on proteolytic digestion mediated by the cells themselves, we characterized ECM digestion in terms of solubilization of 3H-proline--labeled ECM, produced by the use of rat aortic SMCs, by HASMCs under various conditions. Plasmin alone (10 µg/ml) digested 80% of ECM in 2 hours. HASMCs in 10% fetal bovine serum cultured on ECM that was not exposed to plasmin digested 48% of the ECM in 7 days. When HASMCs were cultured on plasmin-pretreated ECM, only 14% of the residual ECM was digested. Conditioned media or cells cultured on porous membrane 1 mm removed from the ECM had no effect. Baseline secretion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) into the media by HASMCs averaged 3.9 ng/105 cells/24 hr and baseline secretion of type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) averaged 1300 ng/105 cells/24 hr. Thrombin (5 U/ml) increased t-PA antigen production by 184% without altering PAI-1 activity and increased ECM degradation by 43% in 7 days. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) decreased t-PA antigen production, increased PAI-1 activity, and decreased ECM degradation. These results suggest that (1) HASMCs can digest naturally produced ECM; (2) plasminogen-dependent mechanisms requiring cell contact are important in the initiation of this phenomenon; and (3) thrombin in the vicinity of clots may modulate the fibrinolytic and proteolytic properties of SMC through t-PA after vascular injury.",

        "abstract": "Increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), but not necessarily peripheral vessel IMT, accompanies atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that IMT in a peripheral, muscular artery known to be resistant to atherosclerotic changes would increase with hypertension, thereby limiting increases in wall stress and potentially preserving endothelial cell function reflected by flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) can inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell migration contributing to increased IMT. Thus, increased PAI-1 may attenuate the mural adaptive response. A high-resolution scanner designed to delineate brachial artery FMD and IMT was used in studies of previously untreated patients with essential hypertension (n = 18) and age- and gender-matched normotensive subjects (n = 15). Brachial IMT was increased with hypertension (0.36 +/- 0.07 vs 0.27 +/- 0.03 mm in controls, p <0.01), and FMD was lower (3.6 +/- 1.5% vs 7.8 +/- 3.6, p <0.01). PAI-1 antigen in blood was increased (40.5 +/- 31.8 vs 26.3 +/- 11.6 ng/ml, p <0.05). IMT and FMD correlated positively (r = 0.63, p <0.05) in hypertensive patients. FMD correlated inversely with wall stress (r = -0.57, p <0.05). IMT correlated inversely with PAI-1 (r = -0.61, p <0.05). These observations support the hypothesis that increased PAI-1 attenuated increases in neointimal vascular smooth muscle cell cellularity. Thus, increased PAI-1 may attenuate a mural, adaptive response to hypertension associated with preservation of endothelial cell function.",

The purpose of this study was to examine whether the circulating level of vascular endothelium-enriched microRNA-126 (miR-126), which is highlighted as a regulator of gene expression, would serve as a novel biomarker for recovery from smoking-related vascular damage.Middle-aged male smokers (n = 30) were enrolled and instructed to stop smoking. Their clinical profiles and laboratory findings including expression of miR-126 were investigated before and after 8 weeks of smoking cessation. Serum levels of cotinine, metabolites of nicotine, were measured to confirm smoking cessation. Endothelial function for peripheral small vessels was assessed and expressed as reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) index. The expression of miR-126 in plasma was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR.At baseline, serum cotinine levels were inversely correlated with RH-PAT index (r = - 0.48, P < 0.01) and positively correlated with levels of metabolic parameters such as non-HDL cholesterol (r = 0.53, P < 0.01) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.52, P < 0.01). The RH-PAT index was not significantly changed after 8 weeks in all subjects, because only 13 subjects could attain smoking cessation. However, changes in the RH-PAT index showed a significant correlation with those in systolic blood pressure (r = - 0.54, P < 0.01). In smokers who completely attained smoking cessation (n = 13), RH-PAT index and plasma levels of miR-126 were significantly increased (P < 0.05, respectively).Endothelial damage was improved and plasma levels of circulating miR-126 were increased after 8 weeks of smoking cessation. These findings suggested a potential use of miR-126 as a biomarker for recovery from smoking-induced vascular damage.",

Snark(+/-) mice exhibited mature-onset obesity and related metabolic disorders. Obesity is regarded as a risk factor for colorectal cancer. To investigate whether Snark deficiency is involved in tumorigenesis in the large intestine, obese Snark(+/-) mice were treated with a chemical carcinogen, azoxymethane (AOM). The incidences of both adenomas and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were significantly higher in Snark(+/-) mice than in their wild-type counterparts 28 weeks after the completion of AOM treatment (10 mg/kg/week for 8 weeks). Furthermore, ACF formation was enhanced in Snark(+/-) mice treated with AOM for 2 weeks, suggesting that Snark deficiency contributed to the early phase of tumorigenesis. The total number of ACF was correlated with bodyweight in Snark(+/-) and Snark(+/+) mice, suggesting that obesity was a risk factor for colorectal tumorigenesis in this model. However, the correlation coefficient was higher in Snark(+/-) mice. Moreover, AOM-induced ACF formation was also enhanced in preobese Snark(+/-) mice. Together, these findings suggest that AOM-induced tumorigenesis in Snark(+/-) mice was enhanced via obesity-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "The accurate detection of lymph node metastases is essential for treatment success in early-stage malignant cancer. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the most effective procedure for detecting small or micrometastases that are undetectable by conventional imaging modalities. To demonstrate a new approach for developing a more efficient SLN biopsy procedure, we reported a two-stage imaging method combining lymphoscintigraphy and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging to depict metastatic cancer cells in SLNs in vivo. Furthermore, the theranostic potential of the combined procedure was examined by cell culture and xenograft mouse model. Anti-HER2 and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) affibody probes were used for NIR fluorescence imaging. Strong NIR fluorescence signal intensity of the anti-EGFR affibody probe was observed in SAS cells (EGFR positive). Radioactivity in the SLNs was clearly observed in the in vivo studies. High anti-EGFR affibody NIR fluorescence intensity was observed in the metastatic lymph nodes in mice. The addition of the IR700-conjugated anti-EGFR affibody to the culture medium decreased the proliferation of SAS cells. Decreased proliferation was shown in Ki-67 immunohistochemistry in xenograft tumors. Our data suggest that a two-stage combined imaging method using lymphoscintigraphy and affibody probes may offer the direct visualization of metastatic lymph nodes as an easily applied technique in SLN biopsy. Although further animal studies are required to assess the effect of treating lymphatic metastasis in this approach, our study results provide a foundation for the further development of this promising imaging and treatment strategy for earlier lymph node metastasis detection and treatment.",

The spectra of resting neutrophils taken under aerobic conditions gave a set of characteristic signals in a high magnetic field (g = 2.85, 2.21 and 1.67) beside signals for myeloperoxidase and others. From the g values, shapes and the results of other experiments, these signals were attributed to those of cytochrome b558. The results indicate that cytochrome b558 in resting neutrophils is a hexa-coordinated ferric hemoprotein in a low-spin state. The obtained gz and gx values for the hemichrome were consistent with that of bis(imidazole)-coordinated hemoprotein.",

Chromatium vinosum ATCC 17899, Rhodobacter capsulatus ATCC 11166, Rhodopseudomonas palustris ATCC 17001, Rhodospirillum molischianum ATCC 14031, and Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170 has been investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR spectra indicate that the electronic ground state of five ferric cytochromes c' is a quantum mechanical admixed-spin state of a high spin (S = 5/2) and an intermediate spin (S = 3/2) at pH 7.2 and is high-spin state at pH 11.0. At physiological pH, however, the content of an intermediate spin state differs with the bacterial source of the protein: approximately 50%, Chromatium vinosum; approximately 40%, Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodopseudomonas palustris; approximately 10%, Rhodospirillum molischianum and Rhodospirillum rubrum. Computer simulation of the spectra supports this diversity of the contribution of an intermediate spin state. Model studies of the ferric porphyrin complexes suggest that the correlation between content of an intermediate spin state and heme iron displacement from the mean heme plane. Therefore, the variation of the content of an intermediate spin state observed in the present study reflects the subtle difference in the degree of heme iron displacement among the proteins.",

However, the association between the waist circumference values and the metabolic risk factors has not been fully established in Japanese middle-aged subjects. We examined the data from 6,033 Japanese middle-aged subjects aged 40-59 yr (4,599 male and 1,434 female). Metabolic risk factors such as high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance were identified according to the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome in Japan. Numbers of metabolic risk factors were significantly associated with the waist circumference values in both male and female subjects. The prevalence of subjects with multiple (two or more) metabolic risk factors was 29.7% and 7.4% in male and female, respectively. According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, the cut-off values of waist circumference with the maximal sensitivity plus specificity to predict the presence of multiple metabolic risk factors were 86 cm and 81 cm in male and female, respectively. These values were in agreement with the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome in Japanese male, but not in female. In conclusion, the waist circumference values can predict the presence of multiple metabolic risk factors in Japanese middle-aged subjects.",

In a survey of 155 undergraduates, STS, mood ratings, and ratings of SWB were collected for three hypothetical weekdays differing in travel mode, travel time, access to bus stops, and daily activity agenda. The results showed that STS is reliable and differentiates between changes in travel conditions.

        "abstract": "Early-staged cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is difficult to diagnose due to its high potential for invasion and metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in a process thought to be important for invasion and metastasis in several cancers, including CCA. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several malignancies, their roles to CCA are not clearly understood. Some miRNAs were reported to be included in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and transferred from their donor cells to other cells, modulating recipient cell behaviors. In this study, the involvement and functional roles of EV-contained miRNAs during EMT in human CCA were determined. Expression profiling identified a subset of miRNAs that were reduced by TGF-β in CCA cells. Among these, miR-30e was highly downregulated by TGF-β and predicted to target Snail, which is an EMT-inducible transcription factor. MiR-30e overexpression suppressed cell invasion and migration via inhibiting EMT, whereas miR-30e inhibition promoted EMT, cell invasion and migration. Moreover, miR-30e was enriched in EVs derived from CCA cells after miR-30e overexpression, and miR-30e intercellular transfer through EVs suppressed EMT, cell invasion and migration in recipient CCA cells. Together, our results suggest that EV-mediated miR-30e transfer could inhibit EMT via directly targeting Snail, which subsequently suppresses CCA cell invasion and migration. These findings provide several new insights into regulatory mechanisms of tumor invasion and metastasis in human CCA.",

        "abstract": "Elevated plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is related to cardiovascular events, but its role in subclinical coronary microvascular dysfunction remains unknown. Thus, in the present study it was investigated whether elevated plasma PAI-1 activity is associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction in hypertensive patients.Thirty patients with untreated essential hypertension and 10 age-matched healthy controls were studied prospectively. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured by using (15)O-water positron emission tomography. Clinical variables associated with atherosclerosis (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), and PAI-1 activity) were assessed to determine their involvement in coronary microvascular dysfunction. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced hyperemic MBF and coronary flow reserve (CFR) were significantly lower in hypertensive patients than in healthy controls (ATP-induced MBF: 2.77+/-0.82 vs 3.49+/-0.71 ml x g(-1) x min(-1); p<0.02 and CFR: 2.95 +/-1.06 vs 4.25+/-0.69; p<0.001). By univariate analysis, CFR was positively correlated with HDL-cholesterol (r=0.46, p<0.02), and inversely with HOMA-IR (r=-0.39, p<0.05) and PAI-1 activity (r=-0.61, p<0.001). By multivariate analysis, elevated PAI-1 activity remained a significant independent determinant of diminished CFR.Elevated plasma PAI-1 activity was independently associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction, which suggests that plasma PAI-1 activity is an important clue linking hypofibrinolysis to the development of atherosclerosis.",

Application of 1-10 microM ATP for 10 min transiently depressed and then slowly augmented the synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons leading to long-term potentiation (LTP). This ATP-induced LTP was blocked by the addition of K-252b, an ecto-protein kinase inhibitor, but was enhanced by the addition of RK682, an ecto-phosphatase inhibitor, both of which do not permeate the cell membrane. These results suggest that ATP applied to the perfusate provides enough substrate for ecto-protein kinase to induce LTP through phosphorylation of extracellular domains of membrane proteins in CA1 neurons.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, we used inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) type 1 receptor (IP3R1) knockout mice to examine the role of this receptor in the induction of LTP, LTD, and DP at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. No difference in synaptically induced field-EPSPs was seen between the wild-type (IP3R1(+/+)) and IP3R1 knockout mice (IP3R1(-/-)), showing that basic synaptic transmission does not involve IP3R1 activation. Tetanus induced LTP in both wild-type and IP(3)R1(-/-) mice, but the magnitude of LTP was significantly greater in IP3R1(-/-) mice (149.8+/-3.5%, mean+/-S.E.M., n=15) than in wild-type mice (132.4+/-1.5%, n=17), suggesting that the IP3R1 has a suppressive effect on LTP induction. To determine whether this effect involved N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP, the effect of tetanus was tested in the present of the NMDAR antagonist, D,L-AP5 (50 microM); under these conditions, the LTP in both IP3R1(-/-) and IP3R1(+/+) mice was not significantly reduced. In addition, group I mGluR activation was shown to be necessary for LTP induction, as the LTP was almost blocked by the group I mGluR antagonist, RS-4CPG (500 microM) in both IP3R1(-/-) (117.6+/-1.7%, n=8) and IP3R1(+/+) (116.9+/-1.8%, n=5) mice. The IP3R1 also plays an essential role in LTD induction, as low-frequency stimulation (LFS) failed to induce LTD in the mutant mice (104.5+/-2.1%, n=10). DP was induced in both IP3R1(-/-) and wild-type mice.",

In spectra, a signal showing existence of oxygen vacancies was observed at about 630 cm −1 for doped samples. The intensity of this band increased with oxygen vacancy formation by Yb-doping and by annealing at high temperatures in dry [low P (H 2 O)] or reducing [low P (O 2 )] conditions. Since a clear relationship between a peak intensity of the oxygen vacancy band and dopant concentration was obtained, it was found oxygen nonstoichiometry in SrCe 1− x Yb x O 3− δ system could be evaluated using this relationship.",

In hippocampal slices from pair-fed control rats, stable LTP was induced by tetanic stimulation consisting of 25 or more pulses at 100 Hz, but not by tetanic stimulation of 15 pulses at 100 Hz, and LTP induction was blocked if the tetanus was delivered in the presence of 8.6 mM ethanol, 1 microM muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor agonist, or 2.5 microM dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5), an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. In hippocampal slices from rats chronically fed a liquid diet containing ethanol, a tetanus consisting of 15 pulses at 100 Hz did induce stable LTP, indicating a decrease in the stimulation threshold for inducing LTP. Application of ethanol, muscimol, or AP5 did not affect LTP induction in these cells, suggesting that the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on LTP induction are mediated by a reduction in GABAergic inhibition or an increase in NMDA receptor activity in hippocampal CA1 neurons.",

The heme iron(III) of these ferric cytochromes c' has been recently reported to be in a quantum mechanically admixed (S = 5/2, 3/2) state [Fujii, S., Yoshimura, T., Kamada, H., Yamaguchi, K., Suzuki, S., Shidara, S. and Takakuwa, S.

The affinity of ferric cytochromes c' for NO among these bacterial species (C. vinosum > Rps. palustris approximately Rb. capsulatus > R. rubrum) was apparently related to the S = 3/2 content in the or der. In the reaction of ferrous cytochrome c' with NO, six- and five-coordinated nitrosylhemes, which represent species with and without a ligand at the axial position trans to nitrosyl group, have been formed. The content of six-coordinated nitrosylheme in NO-ferrous cytochrome c' has been determined to be Rb. capsulatus approximately Rps. palustris > C. vinosum < R rubrum, suggesting that a stability of iron-to-histidine bond decreases with this order.

        "abstract": "Cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (EC) play an important role in the physiological regulation of coronary blood flow, but their function has not been rigorously examined, because suitable in vitro models have not been available. Cardiac macrovascular and microvascular EC were isolated and cultured from 14-16-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats to examine the pharmacological responses of carbachol-induced nitric oxide (NO) production using a Griess method. Carbachol-induced NO production was only detected in cardiac macrovascular EC, which suggests that endothelial production of NO differs between macrovascular and microvascular EC. Next, cardiac microvascular EC was treated with either vehicle, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril, 10 micromol/L) or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (CV11974, 10 micromol/L) for 4 days. Carbachol-induced NO production was improved by captopril (136+/-45nmol, p<0.01 vs vehicle) and CV11974 (146+/-30nmol, p<0.01 vs vehicle). Angiotensin II concentration in the culture medium and protein expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and AT1 receptor in the EC were similar among the 3 groups. Interestingly, the level of muscarinic subtype 3 (M3) receptor was significantly increased in the EC treated with captopril (214%, p<0.01) and CV11974 (296%, p<0.01). When cardiac microvascular EC were treated with neomycin (non-selective phospholipase C inhibitor), carbachol-induced NO production was also improved (146+/-35nmol, p<0.01, neomycin I mmol/L) together with increased expression of M3 receptor (p<0.01). These data suggest that the upregulation of the M3 receptor by captopril or CV11974 occurs via a phospholipase C-dependent pathway. Cardiac microvascular EC also produced NO constitutively, as did the macrovascular EC, but carbachol-induced NO production was decreased. The present data suggest that the upregulation of the M3 receptor by the ACE inhibitor and AT1 receptor antagonist is a new beneficial effect of these drugs on microvascular endothelial function.",

        "abstract": "Several types of cancer cells, including colorectal cancer-derived cell lines, show austerity, the resistance to nutrient starvation, but exactly how cancer cells obtain energy sources under conditions in which their external nutrient supply is extremely limited remains to be clarified. Because autophagy is a catabolic process by which cells supply amino acids from self-digested organelles, cancer cells are likely to use autophagy to obtain amino acids as alternative energy sources. Amino acid deprivation-induced autophagy was assessed in DLD-1 and other colorectal cancer-derived cell lines. The autophagosome-incorporated LC3-II protein level increased after treatment with a combination of autolysosome inhibitors, which interferes with the consumption of autophagosomes. Autophagosome formation was also morphologically confirmed using ectopically expressed green fluorescent protein-LC3 fusion proteins in DLD-1 and SW480 cells. These data suggest that autophagosomes were actively produced and promptly consumed in colorectal cancer cells under nutrient starvation. Autolysosome inhibitors and 3-methyl adenine, which suppresses autophagosome formation, remarkably enhanced apoptosis under amino acid-deprived and glucose-deprived condition. Similar results were obtained in the cells with decreased ATG7 level by the RNA interference. These data suggest that autophagy is pivotal for the survival of colorectal cancer cells that have acquired austerity. Furthermore, autophagosome formation was seen only in the tumor cells but not in the adjacent noncancerous epithelial cells of colorectal cancer specimens. Taken together, autophagy is activated in colorectal cancers in vitro and in vivo, and autophagy may contribute to the survival of the cancer cells in their microenvironment.",

Angiography showed a left high-flow direct carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF), causing steal of the blood flow from the internal carotid artery into the cavernous sinus. A few days later, she rapidly developed right hemiparesis, dysarthria, and ocular conjugate deviation to the right, and became somnolent. Angiography at that time revealed occlusion of the superior petrosal sinus, causing engorgement of the veins in the surrounding brainstem. The CCF was completely embolized with interlocking detachable coils. Her consciousness disturbance and ophthalmoparesis dramatically improved within a few days, and the right hemiparesis and dysarthria gradually resolved. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after the treatment showed small pontine hemorrhage and perifocal edema but no ischemic lesions in the cerebral hemisphere. Re-evaluation of the MR imaging with gadolinium taken on admission demonstrated engorged veins in the brainstem parenchyma, which corresponded to the hemorrhagic lesion in the brainstem. Brainstem congestion caused by direct CCF is very rare, but it can be life-threatening. Good outcome can be expected if the CCF is completely occluded before congestive hemorrhage occurs.",

Increasing the temperature of the perfusing medium from 30 degrees C to 45 degrees C attenuated the amplitude of the synaptically and the non-synaptically evoked CA1 population spikes. Bath application of 1 microM 8-cyclopentyltheophylline, an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, did not affect non-synaptically evoked CA1 population spikes, but significantly increased the amplitude of synaptically evoked population spikes in the upper range of hyperthermia (37-43 degrees C). In contrast, application of 5 microM L- N(6)-phenylisopropyladenosine, an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, did not affect non-synaptically evoked CA1 population spikes, but significantly decreased the amplitude of synaptically evoked population spikes in the upper range of hyperthermia. Binding assays using crude hippocampal synaptosomes showed that the affinity of adenosine A1 receptors for a radio-labeled adenosine analogue increased in response to a temperature increase. These results suggest that increased activation of adenosine A1 receptors in response to a temperature increase depresses excitatory synaptic responses in hippocampal CA1 neurons.",

        "abstract": "The present study has investigated the role of ATP in the induction of synaptic plasticity, using local application of ATP by picopump administration into the stratum radiatum of guinea pig hippocampal region CA1. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents synapsing on CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampal slices were monitored in voltage-clamp mode, using whole-cell recording. Brief local application of ATP (1 mM) induced an inward current, usually consisting of early- and late-phase components. Because the late-phase component of an ATP-induced current was largely inhibited by Ca2+-free solution, this component is supposed to depend on extracellular Ca2+. After local application of ATP, long-term synaptic modification of EPSCs was induced: LTP was detected in neurons exhibiting a small late Ca2+ current, while LTD was obtained from recordings showing a large late Ca2+ current in response to ATP application. There was a statistically significant correlation between the magnitude of long-term plastic changes and the size of Ca2+ currents in response to ATP application. Furthermore, there was significant difference between the average size of the Ca2+ current in the LTP group and the size in the LTD group. These results suggest that a small Ca2+ influx in response to ATP application induces LTP, whereas a large one induces LTD in guinea pig hippocampal CA1 neurons.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension is an important risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis, which is accelerated by inflammation and diminished fibrinolysis. We have previously shown that levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the major physiologic inhibitor of fibrinolysis, are increased with atherogenic metabolic derangement. Because the liver is one of the major sources of circulating PAI-1, we here examined the effects of two proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6, on PAI-1 production in a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. IL-1beta (1 ng/ml) and IL-6 (1 ng/ml) increased the accumulation of PAI-1 in the conditioned media over 24 h (IL-1beta: 2.1 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SD) fold over the control; IL-6:1.4 +/- 0.2 fold; Western blot, p < 0.05). The increase in PAI-1 protein accumulation correlated with the increased expression of PAI-1 mRNA (Northern blot). An HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (mevastatin, 10 micromol/l) attenuated the PAI-1 production induced by IL-1beta and IL-6. The plasma PAI-1 activity level was higher in hypertensives than in normotensives (10.0 +/- 9.8 AU/ml vs. 6.2 +/- 4.5 AU/ml, p < 0.05). The plasma PAI-1 antigen level was also higher in hypertensives than in normotensives (30.9 +/- 22.4 ng/ml vs. 24.4 +/- 13.3 ng/ml, p < 0.05). Thus, 1) IL-1beta and IL-6 can increase PAI-1 production in hepatic cells and 2) mevastatin may exert anti-thrombotic effects by decreasing the PAI-1 protein production induced by these proinflammatory cytokines. These results provide further insights into how inflammation is involved in the atherothrombotic complications observed in hypertensives, which may be ameliorated by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",

Example of possible candidates in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer include BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer (CRC) or MET amplification in gastric cancer, for which corresponding targeting agents showed attractive activity in early phase clinical trials. Efficient screening systems for these relatively minor cancer genome alterations are necessary for the successful development of targeted therapies. We initiated a nationwide screening project in Japan (GI-SCREEN) in February 2014 to detect rare mutations from CRC (GI-SCREEN 2013-01-CRC). The patient’s population will be expanded to non-CRC GI cancer (SCRUM-Japan GI-SCREEN 2015-01-Non CRC). The objective of these consecutive projects is to evaluate the frequency of oncogenic genome alterations in advanced GI cancers and to facilitate the enrollment of patients in IND registration trials for targeted therapies as well as optimal individualized treat...",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is driven by the accumulation of driver mutations, but the contributions of specific mutations to different steps in malignant progression is not fully understood. In this study, we generated mouse models harboring different combinations of key CRC driver mutations (Apc, Kras, Tgfbr2, Trp53, Fbxw7) in intestinal epithelial cells to comprehensively investigate their roles in the development of primary tumors and metastases. Apc∆716 mutation caused intestinal adenomas and combination with Trp53R270H mutation or Tgfbr2 deletion induced submucosal invasion. The addition of KrasG12D mutation yielded EMT-like morphology and lymph vessel intravasation of the invasive tumors. In contrast, combinations of Apc∆716 with KrasG12D and Fbxw7 mutation was insufficient for submucosal invasion but still induced EMT-like histology. Studies using tumor-derived organoids showed that KrasG12D was critical for liver metastasis following splenic transplantation, when this mutation was combined with either Apc∆716 plus Trp53R270H or Tgfbr2 deletion, with the highest incidence of metastasis displayed by tumors with a Apc∆716 KrasG12D Tgfbr2-/- genotype. RNAseq analysis of tumor organoids defined distinct gene expression profiles characteristic for the respective combinations of driver mutations, with upregulated genes in Apc∆716 KrasG12D Tgfbr2-/- tumors found to be similarly upregulated in specimens of human metastatic CRC. Our results show how activation of Wnt and Kras with suppression of TGF-β signaling in intestinal epithelial cells is sufficient for CRC metastasis, with possible implications for the development of metastasis prevention strategies.",

        "abstract": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been incorporated into pathogenic bacterial identification methods and has improved their rapidity. Various methods have been reported to directly identify bacteria with MALDI-TOF MS by pretreating culture medium in blood culture bottles. Rapid BACpro® (Nittobo Medical Co., Ltd.) is a pretreatment kit for effective collection of bacteria with cationic copolymers. However, the Rapid BACpro® pretreatment kit is adapted only for MALDI Biotyper (Bruker Daltonics K.K.), and there has been a desire to expand its use to VITEK MS (VMS; bioMerieux SA). We improved the protocol and made it possible to analyze with VMS. The culture medium bacteria collection method was changed to a method with centrifugation after hemolysis using saponin; the cationic copolymer concentration was changed to 30% of the original concentration; the sequence with which reagents were added was changed; and a change was made to an ethanol/formic acid extraction method. The improved protocol enhanced the identification performance. When VMS was used, the identification rate was 100% with control samples. With clinical samples, the identification agreement rate with the cell smear method was 96.3%. The improved protocol is effective in blood culture rapid identification, being both simpler and having an improved identification performance compared with the original.",

        "title": "Diacylglycerol kinase ε localizes to subsurface cisterns of cerebellar Purkinje cells.",
        "abstract": "Following activation of Gq protein-coupled receptors, phospholipase C yields a pair of second messengers: diacylglycerol (DG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DG to produce phosphatidic acid, another second messenger. Of the DGK family, DGKε is the only DGK isoform that exhibits substrate specificity for DG with an arachidonoyl acyl chain at the sn-2 position. Recently, we demonstrated that hydrophobic residues in the N-terminus of DGKε play an important role in targeting the endoplasmic reticulum in transfected cells. However, its cellular expression and subcellular localization in the brain remain elusive. In the present study, we investigate this issue using specific DGKε antibody. DGKε was richly expressed in principal neurons of higher brain regions, including pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and neocortex, medium spiny neurons in the striatum and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. In Purkinje cells, DGKε was localized to the subsurface cisterns and colocalized with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-1 in dendrites and axons. In dendrites of Purkinje cells, DGKε was also distributed in close apposition to DG lipase-α, which catalyzes arachidonoyl-DG to produce 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, a major endocannabinoid in the brain. Behaviorally, DGKε-knockout mice exhibited hyper-locomotive activities and impaired motor coordination and learning. These findings suggest that DGKε plays an important role in neuronal and brain functions through its distinct neuronal expression and subcellular localization and also through coordinated arrangement with other molecules involving the phosphoinositide signaling pathway.",

Eighty two-adult households who were owners of at least one car were randomly assigned to three experimental groups and one control group. Both experimental and control groups logged their car trips during one week before, one week during, and one week after treatment. The treatment consisted of charging two of the experimental groups approxi- mately 100% of normal cost per kilometer of driving during 2 weeks, and charging the third experimental group this amount per kilometer of driving during 4 weeks. With the purpose of investigating whether deliberate planning increases the effect of economic disincentives, the households in one of the former and in the latter group were asked to fill out a prospective car log for the following week. The control group was not charged or requested to fill out a prospec- tive car log but was in other respects treated in the same way. Analyses of the car logs and odometer readings during and at the end of treatment showed a weak reduction of car use due to the economic disincentives that however were almost completely dependent on planning.",

        "abstract": "Retrospective analyses in the West suggest that mutations in KRAS codons 61 and 146, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA are negative predictive factors for cetuximab treatment in colorectal cancer patients. We developed a novel multiplex kit detecting 36 mutations in KRAS codons 61 and 146, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA using Luminex (xMAP) assay in a single reaction.Tumor samples and clinical data from Asian colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab were collected. We investigated KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations using both the multiplex kit and direct sequencing methods, and evaluated the concordance between the 2 methods. Objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were also evaluated according to mutational status.In total, 82 of 83 samples (78 surgically resected specimens and 5 biopsy specimens) were analyzed using both methods. All multiplex assays were performed using 50 ng of template DNA. The concordance rate between the methods was 100%. Overall, 49 (59.8%) patients had all wild-type tumors, 21 (25.6%) had tumors harboring KRAS codon 12 or 13 mutations, and 12 (14.6%) had tumors harboring KRAS codon 61, KRAS codon 146, BRAF, NRAS, or PIK3CA mutations. The response rates in these patient groups were 38.8%, 4.8%, and 0%, respectively. Median PFS in these groups was 6.1 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.1-9.2), 2.7 months (1.2-4.2), and 1.6 months (1.5-1.7); median OS was 13.8 months (9.2-18.4), 8.2 months (5.7-10.7), and 6.3 months (1.3-11.3), respectively. Statistically significant differences in both PFS and OS were found between patients with all wild-type tumors and those with KRAS codon 61, KRAS codon 146, BRAF, NRAS, or PIK3CA mutations (PFS: 95% CI, 0.11-0.44; P < 0.0001; OS: 95% CI, 0.15-0.61; P < 0.0001).Our newly developed multiplex kit is practical and feasible for investigation of a range of sample types. Moreover, mutations in KRAS codon 61, KRAS codon 146, BRAF, NRAS, or PIK3CA detected in Asian patients were not predictive of clinical benefits from cetuximab treatment, similar to the result obtained in European studies.",

The device feature includes visibility of the bilayer and variable volume of the droplets, together with sub-microliter volumes of droplets and time-course observation. Referring the metering and storage modules that we recently reported, a pair of droplets was generated in symmetrical two-layered (top and bottom) channels; the droplets then moved into the storage well and contacted with each other from the top and the bottom layers. We demonstrated a bilayer formation using the device and observed crystallization of potassium ferricyanide, which was probably attributed to water permeation through the bilayer.",

        "abstract": "A 72-year-old woman was admitted to our institution because of sudden chest pain. Emergency coronary angiography revealed thrombotic occlusion of the distal right coronary artery. A large cylindrical thrombus was retrieved from her distal right coronary artery using a thrombus aspiration catheter. IVUS showed minimal atherosclerosis and moderate ectatic change at the proximal right coronary artery. A reconstructed IVUS image also showed that a mural thrombus with abrupt ending was still retained at the ectatic segment. Based on this evidence, coronary ectasia was thought to be the primary cause for the thrombus formation and acute myocardial infarction in this case.",

Both axial and lateral\n resolution of 15 M, evaluated using a phantom model, were better than those of the current 10-MHz linear probe. To compare\n interobserver variability in measurement of medium-sized muscular arteries acquired using a 7.5-MHz linear probe (7.5 M),\n a 10-MHz linear probe (10M) and 15 M, two observers independently acquired images of the brachial and radial arteries, and\n measured the diameter and intima-media thickness (IMT) of those arteries in 17 male volunteers. Intraobserver variability\n in determining percent flowmediated dilatation (%FMD) was assessed in the same subjects using 15 M. Coefficients of variation\n (CV) in arteries measured using 7.5 M, 10 M, and 15 M were 7.0%, 2.5%, and 1.5%, respectively, for the diameter of the brachial\n artery; 10.3%, 5.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, for the diameter of the radial artery; and 17.0%, 13.8%, and 8.5%, respectively,\n for IMT of the far wall of the brachial artery.

        "abstract": "In CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices, long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by 10 min application of 10 microM aminocyclopentane-1S, 3R-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD), the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, in the presence of test synaptic inputs (once every 20 s). In contrast, long-term depression (LTD) was induced by application of 10 microM ACPD in the absence of test inputs. When 10 microM ACPD was applied in the presence of test inputs, co-application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate resulted in LTD induction when used at 50 microM. In ACPD-induced LTP, the delivery of test synaptic inputs to CA1 neurons could be replaced by co-application of NMDA (100 nM) during ACPD perfusion. These results suggest that, in CA1 neurons, a co-operative effect involving the activation of both mGluRs and NMDA receptors is required to trigger the process involved in ACPD-induced LTP. In addition, ACPD-induced LTD was blocked by co-application of an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor inhibitor, 2-aminotheoxydiphenyl borate (10 microM), which had no effect on ACPD-induced LTP. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate that ACPD-induced LTP involves NMDA receptors, but not IP3 receptors, whereas the converse applies to ACPD-induced LTD.",

        "abstract": "1. Using simultaneous recordings of the field EPSP and the population spike in the CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices, we confirmed that delivery of a high-frequency stimulation (tetanus: 100 pulses at 100 Hz) produced robust long-term potentiation of synaptic efficacy (LTP) in two independent components, a synaptic component that increases field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and a component that results in a larger population spike amplitude for a given EPSP size (E-S potentiation). 2. In the same cells, reversal of LTP (depotentiation; DP) in the field EPSP and in the E-S component is achieved by delivering low-frequency afferent stimulation (LFS: 1 Hz, 1000 pulses) 20 min after the tetanus. 3. When the tetanus or LFS was applied to CA1 inputs in the presence of an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyltheophylline (1 microM), the field EPSP was enhances in LTP and attenuated in DP, while the E-S relationship was not significantly affected in either LTP or DP. 4. When similar experiments were performed using an A2 receptor antagonist, CP-66713 (10 microM), the field EPSP was blocked in LTP but facilitated in DP, while E-S potentiation was enhanced during both LTP and DP. 5. The results show that endogenous adenosine, acting via A1 or A2 receptors, modulates both the synaptic and the E-S components of the induction and reversal of LTP. Based on the results, we discuss the key issue of the contribution of these receptors to the dynamics of neuronal plasticity modification in hippocampal CA1 neurons.",

        "abstract": "Topical ointment consists of an active ingredient and vehicle, and the vehicle largely comprises the volume of the ointment. During the treatment of chronic wounds, such as pressure ulcers, the vehicle has been considered inactive, only serving as a carrier of the main pharmaceutical. However, recent reports have indicated that the vehicle has distinct clinical effects that depend on its physicochemical properties. Therefore, an understanding of the action mechanism of the ointment vehicle in wound tissue is necessary. In this study, we established a mouse model to analyze tissue reactions induced by the following ointment vehicles, an oil-in-water emulsion (EM) vehicle; a macrogol ointment (MO), which is a water-soluble, hydrophilic vehicle; and a MOs containing sucrose (MS). EM-treated wounds exhibited an inflammatory reaction characterized by tissue edema and thick granulation tissue; however, MO- and MS-treated wounds did not exhibit this reaction. Moreover, EM-treated wounds exhibited infiltration of inflammatory cells unlike MO-treated wounds. In contrast, the formation of collagenous tissue was dominantly observed in MO-treated wounds. Because the vehicle regulates the water environment of the wound, the water-holding extracellular matrix molecules, including hyaluronan (HA) and proteoglycan, were examined using immunohistochemical and biochemical methods. The versican G1 fragment, serum-derived HA-associated protein (SHAP) and HA (the VG1F-SHAP-HA) complex characteristically found in inflammatory conditions of pressure ulcers was found in EM-treated wounds. To histologically analyze the mechanism of action of the vehicle, we evaluated the ointment vehicle-wound tissue interface in an en bloc manner. Formation of the HA-containing complex was observed locally between the vehicle and wound surface. On the basis of these data, ointment vehicles regulate the wound-healing process through the formation of HA-rich extracellular matrices at the ointment-wound interface. The present study provides a better understanding of the treatment of deep-pressure ulcers with focus on ointment vehicles. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract  Objectives  Lung adenocarcinoma is heterogeneous, characterized by various histological subtypes. Determination of the predominant histological subtype (lepidic, papillary, acinar or solid-predominant) has been shown to correlate with genetic abnormalities and clinicopathological features. Although subtyping using small biopsy samples is important for tailored approaches to clinical management, limited data exist on the concordance of predominant subtype between resected specimens and biopsy specimens.  Materials and methods  We compared the diagnosed predominant subtypes in resected specimens and matched biopsy specimens in a series of 327 lung adenocarcinomas. The accuracy of preoperative diagnosis by biopsy and the factors that influence concordance with resected specimen analysis were examined.  Results  In 211 of the 326 patients (66.0%), the predominant adenocarcinoma subtype diagnosed from biopsy matched the findings of resection analysis. Overall, the concordance rate in biopsy samples with larger tumor areas (≥0.7mm 2 ) was significantly higher than in those with smaller tumor area ( 2 ; 71.2% vs 60.7%, respectively;  p =0.015). In the biopsy samples with smaller tumor areas, the concordance rate was 77% in lepidic subtype, 71% in papillary subtype, 60% in solid subtype, and 40% in acinar subtype. Concordance rate in the biopsy samples with larger tumor area was higher in papillary and solid subtypes (88% and 76%, respectively), but remained low in acinar subtype (37%).  Conclusion  The current results indicate that accuracy of adenocarcinoma subtyping based on small biopsy samples is influenced by tumor area. Our study also suggests that subtyping of acinar histology using biopsy specimen is particularly error-prone.",

In the present study, a diglutathionyl dinitrosyl iron complex [DNIC-(GS)2] was injected into mice and its abdominal distribution and behavior were examined by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The X-band EPR signal intensity of the blood, liver, kidney, and spleen decreased with time but signals from the liver and kidney were readily detectable even 24h after the injection. The time courses of signal intensity were quite similar when the agent was administered via intravenous and subcutaneous injection routes, suggesting that DNIC-(GS)2 can penetrate readily and rapidly through the membranes. Real-time detection of DNIC-(GS)2 in the upper abdomen of the living mice was performed by employing an in vivo EPR spectroscopy. These results suggest that DNIC-(GS)2, an endogenous NO carrier, has an excellent membrane permeability and has a relatively high affinity for the liver and kidney.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is one of the major causes of death. Data from animal experiments suggest that atherosclerosis involves an inflammatory process of the vascular wall under hyperlipidemia. Atherothrombosis can become a serious complication of atherosclerosis leading to acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Clinical applications to use this knowledge remain scarce. The plasma levels of vascular endothelium-enriched microRNA (miRNAs) in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease could serve as a disease marker. In our laboratory vascular endothelium-enriched miRNA (miR-126) level was analyzed using quantitative RT polymerase chain reaction analysis (qRT-PCR) in plasma from patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) according to the chest symptom or findings of electrocardiogram, or middle-aged male smokers. Endothelial function for peripheral small vessels was assessed using End-PAT 2000 and expressed as reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) index. In patients with suspected CAD miR-126 was not significantly changed in CAD patients. However, miR-126 was decreased in CAD patients who also have high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Interestingly, miR-126 was increased when LDL cholesterol was high in patients who did not have evident CAD on coronary angiography even though they have risk factors for CAD. In smokers serum cotinine levels were inversely correlated with endothelial function expressed as RH-PAT index and positively correlated with levels of metabolic parameters such as non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and insulin resistance. More than half of the smokers could not completely attain smoking cessation and, thus, the RH-PAT index was not improved 8 weeks after the instruction of smoking cessation. However, changes in the RH-PAT index showed a significant correlation with those in systolic blood pressure. In smokers who completely attained smoking cessation, both RH-PAT index and plasma miR-126 values were increased. Thus, among patients with suspected CAD or subjects with coronary risk factors plasma levels of endothelium-enriched circulating miR-126 could be substantially altered. The results suggest a potential usefulness of miR-126 as a sensitive biomarker in assessing endothelial damage. Measurement of microRNA may serve as a useful tool for laboratory assays to determine high-risk patients for atherothromobotic vascular diseases.",

Cell-conditioned medium was assayed for tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1--(PAI-1) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To determine whether the induction of u-PA was mediated by oxygen-centered radicals, the following were added to media: superoxide dismutase (a scavenger of O2-.), catalase (a scavenger of O2-. and H2O2) and dimethylthiourea (a scavenger of OH.).Interleukin-1 beta had no effect upon elaboration of fibrinolytic system proteins by HCME. By contrast, TNF selectively increased elaboration of u-PA. Accumulation of t-PA and PAI-1 remained unchanged. Accumulation of u-PA was inhibited by cycloheximide, implying that there was a requirement for protein synthesis. Dimethylthiourea abolished the increase elaboration of u-PA induced by TNF completely, catalase did so partially, and SOD did not do so at all.The propensity of HCME to elaborate u-PA rather than PAI-1 appears to render cerebral microvasculature particularly vulnerable to proteolytic attack in settings in which inflammatory cytokines are elaborated locally or in which their concentrations in blood are elevated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Histological vascular invasion (VI) is major predictor of recurrence after surgery for several cancer types. We previously reported that VI with abundant stromal cell infiltrates was a negative prognostic factor in lung adenocarcinoma. This study examined whether stromal cell infiltrates within VI are associated with prognosis in high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (HGNEC) of the lung. Methods We investigated the relationship between the frequency and density of VI and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 60 resected HGNEC patients without adjuvant chemotherapy. We examined prognostic effects of CD204 (+) macrophages, CD34 (+) microvessels and α-smooth muscle actin (+) myofibroblasts within VI. Correlation between expressions of stem cell-related molecules (ALDH-1, Notch 1, CD44) and epithelial–mesenchymal transition-related molecules (E-cadherin, S100A4) in cancer cells within VI and RFS was also analyzed. Results Among 60 cases, 51 cases showed VI. Although the presence of VI was a significant predictor for worse RFS (P = 0.04), the frequency and density of VI were not correlated with RFS. The number of CD204 (+) macrophage, CD34 (+) microvessels and α-smooth muscle actin (+) myofibroblasts within VI did not influence on the RFS. On the contrary, cases with higher Notch 1 expression in cancer cells in the VI displayed significantly shorter RFS than lower expression group (7.6 vs. 29.4 months, P = 0.02). Conclusions The current study revealed the presence of stromal cells within VI was not significant predictor for recurrence in HGNEC. This suggests that in HGNEC, unlike adenocarcinoma, intravascular stromal cells are not major contributors to metastasis.",

Using this method, P (O 2 ) variation in the SDC disc-shaped sample of 4 mm in thickness and 15 mm in diameter was determined by evaluating P (O 2 ) between fuel- and air-side faces, and along the radius inside the pellet under the open-circuit conditions of SOFCs.

        "abstract": "Lymphatic infiltration has been recognized as a significant risk factor for lymph node metastasis of submucosal invasive colorectal cancer (SICC), but it is difficult to detect microscopically on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides. We therefore identified lymphatic infiltration of tumor cells with D2-40 monoclonal antibody, which reacts specifically against the endothelium of lymphatic vessels, to make an objective and precise diagnosis.The surgical specimens of 122 consecutive patients with nonpedunculated SICC were examined for lymphatic infiltration by immunohistochemical staining with D2-40 monoclonal antibody (LI-D) and for venous infiltration by Elastica van Gieson staining (VI-E).Lymph node metastasis was found in 20 patients. Multivariate analysis showed that LI-D (p = 0.0415) and VI-E (p = 0.0119) were significant risk factors for lymph node metastasis. Regardless of the presence of risk factors including at least either lymphatic infiltration or venous infiltration, no lymph node metastasis-positive patients were found (0%) among the 25 patients whose colorectal cancer had a submucosal invasive depth of less than 1,500 microm. No lymph node metastasis was found in any of the patients with a depth of submucosal invasion of less than 3,000 microm, who had no risk factors, including LI-D or VI-E.Correct evaluation of lymphatic infiltration by immunohistochemical staining with D2-40 monoclonal antibody may play a crucial role in determining whether there are indications for additional treatment in the management of endoscopically resected SICC.",

        "abstract": "CD133 and CD44 are putative cancer stem cell (CSC) markers in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, their clinical significance is currently unclear. Here, we evaluated primary CRC cell isolates to determine the significance of several CSC markers, including CD133 and CD44, as predictors of tumourigenesis and prognosis.CD133- and CD44-positive cells from fresh clinical samples of 77 CRCs were selected by flow cytometric sorting and evaluated for tumourigenicity following subcutaneous transplantation into NOD/SCID mice. Cancer stem cell marker expression was examined in both xenografts and a complementary DNA library compiled from 167 CRC patient samples.CD44(+), CD133(+) and CD133(+)CD44(+) sub-populations were significantly more tumourigenic than the total cell population. The clinical samples expressed several transcript variants of CD44. Variant 2 was specifically overexpressed in both primary tumours and xenografts in comparison with the normal mucosa. A prognostic assay using qRT-PCR showed that the CD44v2(high) group (n=84, 5-year survival rate (5-OS): 0.74) had a significantly worse prognosis (P=0.041) than the CD44v2(low) group (n=83, 5-OS: 0.88).CD44 is an important CSC marker in CRC patients. Furthermore, CRC patients with high expression of CD44v2 have a poorer prognosis than patients with other CD44 variants.",

Although the impact of BRAF or PIK3CA mutation on efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy is still controversial, targeting agents for these mutations are under developing. Efficient screening systems for these relatively minor mutations with short turnaround time are necessary for the successful development of targeted therapies. Methods: This study was initiated in February 2014 as one of new nationwide genomic screening projects for advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients in Japan. Patients with aCRC who are planned to receive systemic chemotherapy were eligible. A total of 36 mutations of KRAS codon 61, 146, NRAS codon 12, 13, 61, BRAF codon 600, PIK3CA codon 542, 545, 546 and 1047 in genomic DNA of cancer cells were simultaneously analyzed at a quality-controlled central laboratory using Luminex (xMAP) technology in a single reaction using 5...",

Akiyama et al. found that the piezoelectricity of ScAlN thin films increases monotonically with increasing Sc concentration, r. The piezoelectricity reaches a maximum at r = 43 at%, at which point the piezoelectric coefficient, d 33 , is five times that of pure AlN. Hashimoto et al. reported that a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator based on the ScAlN/6H-SiC structure exhibited resonance Q, anti-resonance Q, and K 2  values of 340, 240, and 4.5%, respectively, at 3.8 GHz. These values suggest that a ScAlN thin film on a hard substrate should be a suitable SAW wideband filter substrate for next-generation wireless communication systems.",

        "abstract": "Objective—We sought to determine the etiologic mechanism of proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and statin as regulators of synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the physiological fibrinolysis inhibitor and an acute-phase reactant. Methods and Results—Transient transfection and luciferase assay in HepG2 human hepatoma-derived cells demonstrated that IL-6 increased PAI-1 promoter activity and mevastatin decreased IL-6-inducible response. Systematic deletion assay of the promoter demonstrated that the region (239 to 210 bp) containing a putative CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) binding site was necessary. Point mutation in this site abolished the IL-6-inducible response. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that C/EBP, C/EBP, and C/EBP were involved in protein-DNA complex formation in intact cells. Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I footprinting analysis revealed that 5 flanking region (232 to 210 bp) is acute-phase response protein-binding site. C/EBP binding activity was increased by IL-6 and attenuated by mevastatin. Mevastatin attenuated IL-6-mediated increase of C/EBP protein in the nuclear extracts. IL-6 also increased PAI-1 and C/EBP mRNA in mouse primary hepatocytes. Conclusions—IL-6 increases hepatic PAI-1 expression mediated by the 232- to 210-bp region of the promoter containing a C/EBP binding site. Vascular protection by statins may be partly mediated through regulation of CEBP and consequent modulation of PAI-1 expression. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2005;25:1078-1084.)",

        "abstract": "Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) plays a key role in pathophysiological cellular responses by regulating the levels of a lipid messenger diacylglycerol. Of DGK isozymes, DGKζ localizes to the nucleus in various cells such as neurons. We previously reported that DGKζ translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons after 20 min of transient forebrain ischemia. In this study, we examined the underlying mechanism of DGKζ translocation using hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to simulate an ischemic model of the brain. DGKζ-immunoreactivity gradually changed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in CA1 pyramidal neurons after 20 min of OGD and was never detected in the nucleus after reoxygenation. Intriguingly, DGKζ was detected in the nucleus at 10 min OGD whereas the following 60 min reoxygenation induced complete cytoplasmic translocation of DGKζ. Morphometric analysis revealed that DGKζ cytoplasmic translocation correlated with nuclear shrinkage indicative of an early process of neuronal degeneration. The translocation under OGD conditions was blocked by NMDA receptor (NMDAR) inhibitor, and was induced by activation of NMDAR. Chelation of the extracellular Ca blocked the translocation under OGD conditions. These results show that DGKζ cytoplasmic translocation is triggered by activation of NMDAR with subsequent extracellular Ca influx. Furthermore, inhibition of PKC activity under OGD conditions led to nuclear retention of DGKζ in about one-third of the neurons, suggesting that PKC activity partially regulates DGKζ cytoplasmic translocation. These findings provide clues to guide further investigation of glutamate excitotoxicity mechanisms in hippocampal neurons.",

        "abstract": "Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is recognized as a major co-morbid condition for patients with cardiovascular disease. Although the prevalence of RAS in Western countries has been reported as 13.5-18% in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing coronary angiography, there is little information available about the prevalence of RAS in Asian populations, which are less susceptible to atherosclerosis. To evaluate the prevalence of RAS in Japanese patients suspected of cardiovascular disease and the relationships among RAS and vascular risk factors, especially hypertension, renal artery angiography was performed in a total of 289 consecutive patients receiving diagnostic cardiac catheterization. RAS with a stenosis diameter greater than 50% was considered significant. The prevalence of RAS was 21/289 (7%) including 18 (6%) cases of unilateral stenosis and 3 (1%) of bilateral stenosis. RAS accompanied 14/220 (6%) cases of CAD, 4/34 (12%) cases of valvular heart disease and 1/14 (7%) cases of cardiomyopathy. In the subgroups of CAD, the prevalence of RAS was 5%, 10%, 9%, and 19% in cases of 0, 1, 2 and 3-vessel disease, respectively. Hypertension was more frequent among patients with than among those without RAS (86% vs. 45%, p=0.0003). The prevalence of RAS was 13% in hypertensives and 2% in normotensives (p = 0.004). Thus RAS was frequent in patients with established CAD, and particularly in those with 3-vessel disease. Together, the results showed that hypertension was closely associated with RAS, appearing as both a risk factor and a possible clinical manifestation of the disease. We conclude that more attention should be paid to RAS in Japanese patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "The effects of the mono- and tetrasialogangliosides, GM1 and GQ1b, on ATP-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) were studied in CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices. Application of 5 or 10 microM ATP for 10 min resulted in a transient depression followed by a slow augmentation of synaptic transmission, leading to LTP. LTP induced by treatment with 5 microM ATP was facilitated in hippocampal slices prepared from animals treated for 6 days with a ceramide analog, L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propranol, which stimulates ganglioside biosynthesis. In addition, LTP induced by 5 microM ATP was significantly enhanced when naive slices were incubated with GQ1b but not with GM1. These results suggest that a cooperative effect between extracellular ATP and GQ1b enhances ATP-induced LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons. In addition, the LTP induced by 10 microM ATP was blocked by coapplication of the NMDA antagonist AP5 (5 microM or 50 microM), and this effect was partially inhibited by GQ1b pretreatment of the slices, suggesting that in hippocampal CA1 neurons, the enhancing effect of GQ1b on ATP-induced LTP is mediated by modulation of NMDA receptors/Ca(2+) channels.",

        "abstract": "Phenyl N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) is a spin trapping agent previously shown to exert a neuroprotective effect in infant rat brain during bacterial meningitis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of systemic PBN administration on nitric oxide (NO) production in a rat model of experimental meningitis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We assessed the NO concentration in rat brain tissues with an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) NO trapping technique. In this model, rats receiving intracisternal LPS administration showed symptoms of meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. The time course study indicated that the concentration of NO in the brain reached the maximum level 8.5 h after injection of LPS, and returned to the control level 24 h after the injection. When various doses of PBN (125-400 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally 30 min prior to LPS, NO production in the brain was reduced with increasing PBN dose (250 mg/kg suppressed 80% at 8.5 h after LPS injection), and white blood cells (WBC) in CSF were significantly decreased. We concluded that reduction of NO generation during bacterial meningitis contributes to the neuroprotective effect of PBN in addition to its possible direct scavenging of reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI).",

        "abstract": "The correlation of peripheral endothelial dysfunction and intima-media thickness (IMT) in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) has been unclear. Inflammation and thrombosis may play a role at early stages of atherosclerosis. Thus, early atherosclerosis was noninvasively examined morphologically by IMT of carotid arteries, and functionally by flow mediated dilation (FMD) of brachial arteries in patients who were suspected of CAD and had undergone coronary angiography. Plasma antigen levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, representative atherogenic cytokines, tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), markers of coagulation, and plasma activity level of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a marker of defective fibrinolysis, were measured. Patients with coronary atherosclerosis in one or more vessels with lesion > or = 50% had significantly reduced FMD compared with those with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Carotid artery IMT increased significantly only in patients with advanced coronary atherosclerosis in one or more vessels with lesion > or = 90%. Plasma antigen levels of IL-6 were significantly increased in patients with reduced FMD (< 5%) compared to those in patients with FMD between 10 and 15%. Plasma antigen levels of TF, total and free TFPI, and PAI-1 activity tended to increase with a reduction in FMD. Thus, (1) FMD was reduced at early stages of CAD while IMT was increased in advanced CAD, and (2) inflammation and thrombosis may play a role in the early stages of the atherosclerotic process.",

        "abstract": "Iron complexes with dithiocarbamates, Fe(DTC), and their nitrosyl complexes had been studied extensively until the 1970s because of their unique magnetic and electronic properties. In the 1990s, however, Fe(DTC) are commanding attention from a different point of view. In virtue of their high reactivity toward nitric oxide (NO) and the high stability of the resultant nitrosyl complexes which exhibit a characteristic electron paramagnetic resonance signal, Fe(DTC) have been used for the detection and analysis of biological NO produced endogenously from NO synthases. We have studied the chemical basis of this detection method and its application. In spite of the method’s widespread use, the chemical basis seems to be very poor. We, therefore, review the fundamental data on Fe(DTC) species and their reaction with NO, including the novel reductive nitrosylation mechanism realized in this system.",

Changes of corrected myocardial blood flow (DeltaMBF) and coronary vascular resistance (DeltaCVR) from rest to cold pressor were measured by using 15O-water and positron emission tomography before and after treatment. Blood biomarkers including lipids, glucose, insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were also measured.Olmesartan and amlodipine reduced blood pressure (BP) to the same extent (-28.7 +/- 16.2 mm Hg vs. -26.7 +/- 10.8 mm Hg). In the olmesartan group, DeltaMBF tended to be greater (-0.15 +/- 0.19 ml/g/min vs. 0.03 +/- 0.17 ml/g/min, p = 0.09 by 2-way analysis of variance), and DeltaCVR was significantly decreased (7.9 +/- 23.5 mm Hg/[ml/g/min] vs. -16.6 +/- 18.0 mm Hg/[ml/g/min], p < 0.05) after treatment, whereas these parameters did not change in the amlodipine group (DeltaMBF: -0.15 +/- 0.12 ml/g/min vs. -0.12 +/- 0.20 ml/g/min; DeltaCVR: 6.5 +/- 18.2 mm Hg/[ml/g/min] vs. 4.8 +/- 23.4 mm Hg/[ml/g/min]). Serum SOD activity tended to increase (4.74 +/- 4.77 U/ml vs. 5.57 +/- 4.74 U/ml, p = 0.07 by 2-way analysis of variance) only in the olmesartan group.Olmesartan, but not amlodipine, improved endothelium-dependent coronary dilation in hypertensive patients independent of BP reduction. These beneficial effects on coronary vasomotion might be via an antioxidant property of ARBs.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs have critical roles in a number of serious diseases and, as a result, are of major interest as clinical diagnostic targets. Conventionally, microRNAs are collected from blood and urine samples, and are measured by either quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or microarray. Recently, nanopore sensing techniques have been applied for measuring microRNAs at the single molecule level. However, existing techniques are technically complex, needing several tools and requiring purification and/or labelling of microRNA samples prior to use. Here we report a method for microRNA detection in a simple procedure requiring neither purification nor labelling. This system utilizes magnetic beads anchored with DNA and nanopores on a liposome membrane. In the presence of the target microRNA, it forms a duplex with complementary DNA, which is then cleaved by a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN). The cleaved DNA, which harbors a liposome on its terminus, is subsequently released from the magnetic bead, fuses to the lipid bilayer on chip, and emits an electrical signal derived from the formation of a nanopore. Because of a property of the DSN, the signals derived from microRNAs are expected to be amplified in an isothermal reaction. Our system possesses the specificity to detect target microRNAs from mixtures containing >10 different microRNA sequences and readily uses blood or urine samples. Although the limit of detection is above 10 nM and need to be improved for practical diagnosis, as purification and labelling are not required, the presented system proposes a possible schematic for the development of easy and on-site diagnosis.",

Gross examination of the surgical specimen showed a grayish-white, solid, lobulated tumor, mainly located between the trachea and esophagus, and involving the lower part of the left thyroid lobe. Histologically, the tumor consisted of epithelial cell nests separated by thick fibrous septa. The tumor cells were polygonal in shape, and contained pale cytoplasm and a vesicular nucleus with prominent nucleoli. There were few mitotic figures. Rosette-like arrangements that suggested neuroendocrine differentiation were observed in part of the tumor. The tumor cells were positive for CD5 and neuroendocrine markers including synaptophysin and chromogranin A.",

With increasing Sr-deficiency, z in La 0.6 Sr 0.4– z Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3– δ , its lattice parameters and oxygen content gradually increased and decreased, respectively, which strongly suggested that additional oxygen vacancies were created in the lattice. It is expected that these additional oxygen vacancies improve its oxide ionic conductivity and catalytic property for oxygen reduction. Further increase in z , however, led the LSCF system into a coexistence region with transition metal oxides. In the wide range of P (O 2 ), electrical property of samples 0.00≤ z ≤0.025 was p -type semi-conducting regardless of the z value, whereas its conductivity was strongly affected by a subtle change in z .",

        "abstract": "The axonal conduction of action potentials affects the absolute time it takes to transmit nerve impulses as well as temporal summation at destination synapses. At the physiological level, oligodendrocyte depolarization facilitates axonal conduction along myelinated fibers in the hippocampus; however, the functional significance of this facilitation is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the physiology of the facilitation of axonal conduction by investigating the changes in synaptic responses at destination synapses using male and female mice in which channelrhodopsin-2 expression was restricted to oligodendrocytes. The subiculum, one of the projection areas of the examined axons at the alveus of the hippocampus, is divided into three regions (proximal, mid, and distal) and contains two types of principal neurons: regular firing and bursting pyramidal cells. We found a significant increase in excitatory synaptic responses following optogenetic oligodendrocyte depolarization in bursting neurons at two of the three regions, but not in regular firing neurons at any region. The long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta burst stimulation at the synapses showing a significant increase was also enhanced after oligodendrocyte depolarization. Conversely, the reduction of oligodendrocyte depolarization during theta burst stimulation, which was achieved by photostimulation of archaerhodopsin-T expressed selectively on oligodendrocytes, reduced the magnitude of LTP. These results show that oligodendrocyte depolarization contributes to the fine control of synaptic activity between the axons they myelinate and targets subicular cells in a region- and cell type-specific manner, and suggest that oligodendrocyte depolarization during conditioning stimuli is involved in the induction of LTP.All activity in the nervous system depends on the propagation of action potentials. Changes in the axonal conduction of action potentials influence the timing of synaptic transmission and information processing in neural circuits. At the physiological level, oligodendrocyte depolarization facilitates axonal conduction along myelinated fibers. In this study, we investigated the functional significance of the facilitation of axonal conduction induced by physiological oligodendrocyte depolarization. Using optogenetics and electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrated that oligodendrocyte depolarization in mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 on oligodendrocytes increased excitatory synaptic responses and enhanced the induction of long-term potentiation at destination synapses in a region- and cell type-specific manner. This facilitation may have a hitherto unappreciated influence on the transfer of information between regions in the nervous system.",

        "abstract": "Ischemia with or without reperfusion induces the release of diverse products from monocytes, including cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). To determine whether these phenomena modulate fibrinolysis and potentially exacerbate impairment of the macrocirculation, microcirculation, or both, we characterized the effects of IL-1 on the expression of fibrinolytic system and matrix proteins in rat cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs).Confluent CMECs were exposed to IL-1 in serum-free medium for 24 hours, and cell-conditioned medium was assayed for plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), the primary physiological inhibitor of plasminogen activators, and for type 1 collagen with Western blotting. IL-1 (2 ng/mL) specifically increased the accumulation of PAI-1 (4.4 +/- 0.6-fold; mean +/- SD; n = 9) without affecting tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) or urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) levels, which remained unchanged. IL-1 increased the accumulation of collagen in conditioned media by 3.5 +/- 0.7-fold (n = 6). Conversely, the accumulation of both PAI-1 and collagen induced by IL-1 was inhibited with an IL-1 receptor antagonist (200 ng/mL; n = 6) and with cycloheximide (10 micrograms/mL; n = 6), implying that protein synthesis was a requirement for the effect. To determine whether the IL-1 effect was mediated by induction of oxygen-centered free radical production, known to be induced by IL-1, we exposed the cells to the hydroxyl radical scavenger tetramethylthiourea (10 mmol/L) and observed abolition of the IL-1-induced increase in the expression of PAI-1 and collagen (n = 6). Conversely, superoxides (generated with 10 mU/mL xanthine oxidase plus 0.6 mmol/L hypoxanthine, and 100 mumol/L hydrogen peroxide) induced the accumulation of PAI-1 and collagen (n = 6). IL-1 (1 microgram/kg body wt) and lipopolysaccharide (50 micrograms/kg body wt) administered in vivo increased PAI-1 protein in rat hearts as detected with Western blotting and PAI-1 immunostaining of rat heart microvessels, indicating the effects delineated in vitro were paralleled by effects in vivo.These results indicate that IL-1-induced oxygen-centered free radicals stimulate elaboration of PAI-1 and collagen by CMECs. Accordingly, microvascularly mediated inhibition of fibrinolysis may predispose to the persistence of microvascular thrombi, thereby contributing to impaired microcirculatory function, the no-reflow phenomenon, and cardiac dysfunction after ischemia and reperfusion.",

Increased levels were found in the SHRSP medulla, but not in the WKY medulla. The increase occurred in the hypertension development period, reaching a peak at 20 weeks of age. This increase was confirmed by immunoblotting. There was no significant change of FABP in the cortex. To elucidate the mechanism responsible for these changes in the FABP level, three antihypertensive drugs (nicardipine, hydralazine and enalapril) were given to SHRSP at 20 weeks of age for a period of four weeks. Antihypertensive treatment significantly inhibited the development of hypertension and the increase in the medullary FABP level. The differential response of FABP in SHRSP and WKY suggests that this protein may play an important role in the cellular metabolism of fatty acids under the pathological condition of high blood pressure.",

        "abstract": "This research investigates the role of intermittent monetary costs in restraining  individuals from defection in social dilemmas. In Experiment 1, 104 car owners made  fictitious choices between a slow and a fast travel mode in the context of a continuous  social dilemma. There were four different conditions of monetary costs for choosing  the fast mode (defection): no cost, low cost, high cost to self, or high cost to others.  Participants defected most when there was no cost and least when they themselves were  charged a high cost. A spill‐over effect was obtained such that when others were charged  a high cost to defect, defection rates were lower than under no cost. Experiment 2  used 36 undergraduates as participants in an iterated decision task with real groups.  The results replicated the major results of Experiment 1. Furthermore, whereas prosocials  were strongly affected by intermittent costs for defection (i.e. showed large spill‐over  effects), proselfs seemed to be unaffected. Possible explanations of this interaction  effect between social value orientation and intermittent punishment for defection  are provided. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  ",

        "title": "Application of attitude theory for improved predictive accuracy of stated preference methods in travel demand analysis",
        "abstract": "Stated preference (SP) surveys are frequently adopted by transport planners for the analysis of the impact of transport policies on travel demand. SP surveys are believed to yield stable preference estimates from stated choices from among hypothetical alternatives, which can then be used in forecasting. However, evidence suggests that preferences derived from SP surveys are contingent on context. The objective of this paper is to outline an alternative conceptual framework for travel demand analysis which draws on attitude theory from social psychology. In line with this theory stated choices are interpreted as behavioral intentions. The theory then explains why behavioral intention sometimes deviates from actual behavior. In an empirical demonstration using panel data obtained from commuters ( n =903) before and after the opening of a new subway line in Kyoto, Japan, support is obtained for several predictions about why behavioral intentions are, or are not, implemented.",

        "abstract": "Magnesium (Mg) is a lightweight metal with applications in transportation and sustainable battery technologies, but its current production through ore reduction using the conventional Pidgeon process emits large amounts of CO and particulate matter (PM2.5). In this work, a novel Pidgeon process driven by microwaves has been developed to produce Mg metal with less energy consumption and no direct CO emission. An antenna structure consisting of dolomite as the Mg source and a ferrosilicon antenna as the reducing material was used to confine microwave energy emitted from a magnetron installed in a microwave oven to produce a practical amount of pure Mg metal. This microwave Pidgeon process with an antenna configuration made it possible to produce Mg with an energy consumption of 58.6 GJ/t, corresponding to a 68.6% reduction when compared to the conventional method.",

The tsunami wave arrived initially at 16:50 was observed by tide gauge which is installed on the mouth of the Bay. This wave propagation was also observed by HF radars installed on the inner part of the Bay. Therefore, these observations were considered to be correlated. The result of spectral analysis, the tsunami wave had energy with period bands of 120–140, 60–90 and 30–40 min. In comparison to the previous study suggest that these 60–90 and 30–40 min periods oscillations were attributed to the tsunami source fault.",

        "abstract": "Although hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and smoking are known risk factors of atherosclerosis in Caucasians, their relative contributions to early atherosclerosis among Japanese are unknown. Decrease in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery is a useful marker of endothelial dysfunction and early atherosclerosis. To evaluate the relative contribution of hypertension to early atherogenesis, we determined FMD, as well as plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA; a sensitive index of endothelial damage) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-6 (established markers of inflammation) in normotensive and hypertensive patients under treatment. FMD was significantly reduced as the number of risk factors increased, suggesting that accumulations of risk factors were related to endothelial dysfunction. FMD was reduced in hypertensives (9.9 +/- 5.8 (SD) %) compared to normotensives (14.6 +/- 7.6, p<0.01) despite good blood pressure control (139 +/- 20/80 +/- 14 mmHg in hypertensives). Nitroglycerine-induced endothelium-independent vasodilation was not altered in hypertensives (16.0 +/- 6.3%) as compared to normotensives (16.7 +/- 5.8). Plasma t-PA, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 levels were increased in hypertensives despite good blood pressure control. Thus, hypertension alone is a high risk for early atherosclerosis. Persistent endothelial damage and moderate inflammation may increase the risk of early atherosclerosis synergistically under the presence of hypertension in Japanese.",

Eight Fe(NTA)-catecholate complexes exhibit similar EPR spectra (E/D≈0.20), which suggest that the metal environments in these complexes resemble each other. However, their reaction time with O 2 differs with the substituents on the catecholate. As the substituents become more electron donating, the iron-catecholate complex reacts with O 2 faster. There is no apparent tendency for the ferric center to be reduced. As to Fe(salen)-catecholate complex, EPR spectra indicate an electron-transfer process: [Fe 3+ (salen)DBC]- ⇀ [Fe 2+ (salen)DBSQ]-. These observations suggest that these two iron complexes react with catechols and O 2 via different mechanism. A comparison of the two systems affords useful information about the reaction mechanism of dioxygenase.",

        "abstract": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) is a physiologic inhibitor of fibrinolysis and a known determinant of cardiovascular risk. That its expression is stimulated by insulin in HepG2 human hepatoma cells has been shown earlier. Others have found that increased expression of PAI-1 is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction. Pleiotropic (noncholesterol lowering) effects of statins seem to reduce cardiovascular risk. This study was designed to determine whether insulin stimulation of PAI-1 expression is attenuated by statins, and if so to explore mechanisms that are responsible for the attenuation.PAI-1 protein in the conditioned media was assayed by western blotting, and PAI-1 mRNA expression was measured by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions.Insulin (0.001-10 micromol/l) increased accumulation of PAI-1 protein in the conditioned media and PAI-1 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells. A transient transfection assay of the human PAI-1 promoter-luciferase construct demonstrated that insulin increased PAI-1 promoter activity. Increased PAI-1 mRNA was attenuated significantly by U0126 and PD98059, specific inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase. In contrast, GF109203X, an inhibitor of the protein kinase C pathway, and LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, exerted no effects. Simvastatin (10 micromol/l), known to translocate membrane-bound sterol regulatory element-binding protein to nuclei, attenuated PAI-1 mRNA expression induced by insulin. It did not affect baseline PAI-1 mRNA expression. Intraperitoneal injection of insulin (0.1 IU/kg) increased concentrations of PAI-1 antigen in plasma in mice within 3 h, correlating with hepatic PAI-1 mRNA expression.Insulin-mediated augmented expression of PAI-1 may be amenable to suppression attributable to pleiotropic effects of statins, potentially diminishing cardiovascular risk in patients with insulin resistance.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:  Serotonin, synthesized from enterochromaffin cells, modulates vascular tonus and thrombus formation, and mediates development of atherosclerotic plaque. Oxidative stress is involved in vascular inflammation and progression of atherosclerosis.   Hypothesis:  We hypothesized that plasma serotonin plays a crucial role in increasing oxidative stress and aimed to identify the circulating microRNA(s) associated with serotonin ratio for coronary artery disease (CAD).   Methods:  Blood was sampled from 120 outpatients with cardiovascular risk factors but without a history of previous cardiovascular events. Serotonin levels both in platelet poor plasma (PPP) and whole blood (WB) were measured with HPLC, and the ratio of serotonin in PPP to that in WB (PPP/WB) was used as an index of platelet activation. For assessment of oxidative stress, serum levels of derivative reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) were measured. Total RNA was isolated from subjects who were scheduled for coronary angiography with suspicion of CAD and a microRNA array analysis was performed. The expression levels of microRNAs were scaled by global normalization.   Results:  Serotonin levels in both PPP and PPP/WB ratio were significantly correlated with the d-ROM levels. Among enrolled patients, 25 subjects were diagnosed as having CAD. The levels of the PPP/WB ratio of serotonin, d-ROM, and CRP were significantly higher in subjects with CAD than in those without CAD. Logistic regression analysis performed with endpoint of having CAD revealed that the PPP/WB ratio of serotonin was independently associated with CAD. In subjects with CAD, 5 increased microRNAs and 30 decreased microRNAs were identified among more than 2000 microRNAs as compared to those without CAD. Among candidate microRNAs, expression of microRNA-1914 showed significant inverse correlation with PPP/WB ratio (r=-0.61, P   Conclusions:  A significant association among platelet activation assessed by PPP and PPP/WB ratio and oxidative stress assessed by d-ROM, was detected in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors. Targeting serotonin-oxidative stress axis, and circulating microRNA-1914 may serve as novel strategy for diagnosis of atherosclerotic CAD.",

Recently, membrane protein reconstituted in bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) has been applied for bio/chemical sensors because membrane protein intrinsically has a superior amplification mechanism. For mobile use of such devices, however, the bilayer requires mechanical robustness. Here, we propose a handheld BLM device aiming for a nanopore-based mobile sensor. BLM is formed at the tip of a glass capillary, which is contained in the solution trapped in a cup-like reservoir. This format achieved (i) formation of a sufficiently robust BLM for mobile use, (ii) solution exchange without rupturing BLM, and (iii) sustaining the small number of nanopores in the bilayer for accurate and long-term sensing. The handheld device successfully detected DNA translocations through the nanopores continuously for 75 minutes using 5 nanopores.",

Reduction of long-term potentiation (depotentiation) was achieved by delivering a train of low-frequency afferent stimuli (low-frequency stimulation, 1000 pulses, 1 Hz) 20 min after the tetanus (100 Hz, 100 pulses). In control experiments, low-frequency stimulation reduced the potentiated component of the slope of the field EPSP and the amplitude of the population spike by 68.5 +/- 14.4% and 80.1 +/- 8.8%, respectively (n = 6); these values were significantly reduced to 13.4 +/- 9.7% and 9.0 +/- 10.9% (n = 7) when the low-frequency stimulation was applied during the perfusion with 8-CPT (1 microM).

        "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between cardiac hypertrophy associated with hypertension, and the alterations in myocardial lipid metabolism, nicardipine (160 mg/kg/day), hydralazine (40 mg/kg/day), and enalapril (30 mg/kg/day) were administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats from 20 to 24 weeks of age. Drug administration significantly suppressed the increases in blood pressure and the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight. A marked variation in the fatty acid binding capacities of the delipidated, dealbuminated heart cytosol obtained from these animals was observed in the 24-week-old rats (5.40 +/- 0.31 pmol/micrograms protein in non-treated rats; 4.73 +/- 0.34 pmol/mg protein in nicardipine-treated rats; 5.01 +/- 0.34 pmol/mg protein in hydralazine-treated rats; 4.61 +/- 0.26 pmol/mg protein in enalapril-treated rats) as compared to the 20-week-old non-treated rats (3.38 +/- 0.29 pmol/mg protein). The decrease in this capacity in the drug-treated groups closely correlated with the reduction of cardiac mass, suggesting that the factors governing regression may be closely related to those governing fatty acid binding capacity. It appears that fatty acid binding protein may play an important role in the hypertension-associated hypertrophic myocardium.",

        "abstract": "IP 3 is an important second messenger to release Ca 2+ from internal store. IP 3 receptor (IP 3 R) works as an IP 3 -induced Ca 2+ release channel. We studied the role of type 1 IP 3 R (IP 3 R1) in neural plasticity. We found that IP 3 R1 is necessary for the induction of long-term depression (LTD) by using cerebellar slices of IP 3 R1-deficient mice. We also studied the neural plasticity of the hippocampus. While no differences were seen between mutant and wild-type mice in terms of the mean magnitude of the long-term potentiation (LTP) or LTD induced by a standard tetanus or low-frequency afferent stimulation (LFS), a short tetanus protocol evoked much greater LTP amplitude in the IP 3 R1-deficient mice than the control. In addition, DP or LTP suppression was attenuated in the mutant mice, the mean magnitude of the responses after delivery of LFS or tetanus being significantly greater than in wild-type mice. These results suggested that IP 3 R1 is involved in LTP, DP and LTP suppression, but is not essential for LTD. In addition, IP 3 R1 was involved in the determination of polarity and input specificity of activity-induced synaptic modification in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. We studied the electrophysiological activity and learning behavior of ryanodine receptor (type 3; RyR3) deficient mice. When LTP was evoked using high-frequency stimulation in the CA1 hippocampal neuron, the increase in the initial slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) was not significantly different between homozygous and wild mice, although the increase in the homozygous mice tended to be greater than in the wild mice. With near-threshold stimulation, however, LTP was not induced in wild-type mice but was induced in homozygous mice. In the probe trial test, in which the platform was removed after the training schedule, ryanodine receptor type 3-deficient mice spent significantly more time than the wild-type mice in the quadrant where the platform had been.",

In the first patient, because the site of CSF leakage was not identified and the patient underwent three unsuccessful attempts to close the fistula using the fascia lata, we treated the patient by unifying all paranasal sinuses and by filling them with a free rectus abdominis muscle flap. In the second patient, CSF rhinorrhea recurred 6 years after closure of the fistula using the fascia lata. The patient underwent separation of a porencephalic cyst from the paranasal sinus and a free muscle flap was placed extradurally, because the CSF pulse pressure in the enlarged left anterior horn eroded the previously repaired fascia lata, resulting in the recurrence of CSF leakage.Although duraplasty is the primary procedure for repairing dural fistulas, the vascularized free muscle flap is an alternative method when the location of the fistula is not identified or the patient with recurrent CSF rhinorrhea has severe frontal lobe atrophy and porencephaly.",

However, the rate of electron transfer has not been controlled by the remote input of an external field without changing the geometries or materials of the systems. We demonstrate here that an applied microwave field can enhance the photocatalytic reduction of bipyridinium ion using CdS quantum dots (QDs) by accelerating electron transfer. Analysis of the time-resolved emission decay profiles of CdS quantum dots immersed in aqueous solutions of bipyridinium exhibited the shortening of their emission lifetimes, because of the accelerated electron transfer from QDs to bipyridinium under microwave irradiation. This discovery leads us to a new methodology using microwaves as an external field to enhance photocatalytic reactions.",

        "abstract": "Dinitrosyl dithiolato iron complex (DNIC) has been identified as an endogenous NO carrier, yet in vivo mechanisms of NO donation remain undefined. Transnitrosylation, in which a coordinated NO group is transferred to another metal complex, has been observed in transition-metal-nitrosyl chemistry. In this study, we used three kinds of iron dithiocarbamate complexes (Fe-DTCs) as NO acceptors to elucidate in vivo transnitrosylation of diglutathionyl dinitrosyl iron complex [DNIC-(GS)(2)]. Fe-DTCs were administered to mice after the injection of DNIC-(GS)(2) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were measured both in the resected organs and in the upper abdomen of living mice. The spectral feature gradually changed from an initial DNIC-(GS)(2) signal to mononitrosyl iron dithiocarbamate one, suggesting that NO-Fe-DTC was formed through in vivo reaction of DNIC-(GS)(2) with Fe-DTC. The spectral results in in vitro and in vivo systems indicate that NO-Fe-DTCs can be formed not only by the transfer of coordinated NO-group(s) in DNIC-(GS)(2) but also by the abstraction of Fe-NO group in DNIC-(GS)(2) by free DTC ligands. Transnitrosylation proceeded more rapidly in blood than in liver and kidney; and more efficiently in kidney than in liver. Further, the ability to accept NO from DNIC was dependent on water-solubility of Fe-DTCs. Thus, in vivo transnitrosylation from DNIC to exogenous iron complex could be observed and this reaction was influenced by biological constituents and properties of iron complex. These results demonstrate that the transnitrosylation from DNIC to intrinsic NO acceptors like metalloproteins has a probable significance in in vivo NO transfer process.",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance have been associated with several cardiac features including diastolic heart failure, impaired ventricular function, perimicrovascular fibrosis and increased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in coronary arterial walls. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is one mediator of insulin signaling. This study was performed to determine whether induction of cardiac manifestations typical of insulin resistance and increased PAI-1 expression occur developmentally or post-developmentally as a result of loss of IRS-1-mediated signaling.IRS-1 knockout mice were studied at 20 weeks of age.Compared with control mice, the left ventricular (LV) and cardiac mass to body weight ratios were increased. Diastolic and systolic LV diameters and decreased fractional shortening were indicative of LV dilatation and dysfunction. Coronary perimicrovascular fibrosis, an increased coronary arterial wall to lumen ratio, increased immunoreactivity of PAI-1 in the tunica media and increased PAI-1 mRNA expression were present consistent with constrained mural proteo(fibrino)lysis. These cardiac manifestations were similar to those we and others have observed previously in insulin-resistant mice without impaired IRS-1-mediated signaling.Loss of IRS-1 signaling is sufficient to induce cardiac manifestations typical of insulin resistance including increased coronary arterial mural PAI-1 expression. Furthermore, increased PAI-1 expression is not dependent on IRS-1 signaling.",

The usefulness of ultrasonic tissue characterization by the phase-corrected magnitude of cyclic variation of integrated backscatter (MVIB) in chronic coronary artery disease is not fully validated. Thus, whether MVIB predominantly reflects the contractile reserve or myocardial viability of chronically dysfunctional myocardium was determined.The MVIB of severely dysfunctional interventricular septum or posterior wall was measured in 34 consecutive patients with previous myocardial infarction. Dobutamine stress echocardiography and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were used as the standards of contractile reserve and myocardial viability, respectively.Among 44 dysfunctional segments, only 15 were judged as having contractile reserve and 29 were judged as not by dobutamine stress echocardiography, whereas 26 segments showed myocardial viability using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and 18 did not. MVIB was greater in segments with than in those without contractile reserve (4.7 +/- 2.2 vs -1.4 +/- 4.9 dB, P < .0001), but there was considerable overlap between the groups. On the other hand, MVIB of segments with and without myocardial viability (4.1 +/- 2.6 vs -4.3 +/- 3.3 dB, P < .0001) was distinctly different and predicted myocardial viability with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 94%.For patients with chronic coronary artery disease, MVIB better reflects myocardial viability than it does contractile reserve. Ultrasonic tissue characterization, in concordance with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, is a sensitive method for detecting myocardial viability.",

In this paper, we report the generation of local high temperature regions between catalyst particles under microwave heating. First, we demonstrated that reaction rate of the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol over a magnetite catalyst was enhanced 17- (250 °C) to 38- (200 °C) fold when heated with microwave irradiation rather than an electrical furnace. Subsequently, the existence of microwave-generated specific local heating was demonstrated using a coupled simulation of the electromagnetic fields and heat transfer as well as in situ emission spectroscopy. Specific high-temperature regions were generated at the vicinal contact points of the catalyst particles due to the concentrated microwave electric field. We also directly observed local high temperature regions at the contact points of the particles during microwave heating of a model silicon carbide spherical material using in situ emission spectroscopy. We conclude that the generation of local heating at the contact points between the catalyst particles is a key factor for enhancing fixed-bed flow reactions under microwave irradiation.",

        "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) represents a new paradigm for second messengers in regulation. Despite the numerous physiological and pathophysiological functions of NO, its importance as an endogenous second messenger and a cytostatic and/or cytotoxic agent was unknown until 1987. Recent developments in detection methods for endogenous NO produced directly or indirectly from NO synthases (NOSs) have enabled major advances in our understanding of the role of NO in biological systems. The spin-trapping technique combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a method for analyzing NO production directly both in vivo and in vitro. Iron complexes with dithiocarbamate derivatives are noteworthy among the spin-trapping reagents for NO because NO has a high affinity for iron complexes. The resultant stable nitrosyl iron complexes exhibit an intense three-line signal at room temperature and an axial signal at low temperature. Besides the facility and wide applicability of this method, its outstanding feature is that noninvasive in vivo measurements are available by using a low-frequency EPR spectrometer. In this article, we review on previous and recent developments of in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo EPR detection and imaging of endogenously produced NO.",

        "abstract": "Electrical properties of La 1− x Sr x CoO 3 (LSC) change with variations in Sr content, temperature, and oxygen partial pressure. With a change in each variable, LSC showed metal–insulator transition (MIT). The changes in electrical properties of LSC were correlated here with those of its crystal structure. The variations of crystallographic parameters such as the length of a -axis, the rhombohedral angle, the Co–O distance, and the Co–O–Co angle ( θ ) were precisely determined by powder X-ray Rietveld analysis. Of these, the variation of θ described most consistently the variation of conduction state, metallic or insulating, of LSC. The Co–O–Co angle increased whenever the conduction state changed from insulating to metallic by changing each variable, Sr content, temperature, and oxygen partial pressure. In addition, MIT took place at a critical Co–O–Co angle of ca. 165° in each case. It was concluded that the transition from insulator to metal is caused by the closing of the charge transfer band gap, induced by broadening of the electronic bandwidths of the Co-3 d and O-2 p bands with an expansion of the Co–O–Co angle.",

In this work, a novel Pidgeon process driven by microwaves has been developed to produce Mg metal with less energy consumption and no direct CO emission. An antenna structure consisting of dolomite as the Mg source and a ferrosilicon antenna as the reducing material was used to confine microwave energy emitted from a magnetron installed in a microwave oven to produce a practical amount of pure Mg metal. This microwave Pidgeon process with an antenna configuration made it possible to produce Mg with an energy consumption of 58.6 GJ/t, corresponding to a 68.6% reduction when compared to the conventional method.",

To investigate the distributions of SC injected NO-bound iron complexes in the abdomens of mice, we measured ESR signals in resected abdominal organs. The signal amplitude was higher in the resected liver than in the resected gastrointestinal organs or the blood samples.

        "abstract": "Obesity and insulin resistance confer increased risk for accelerated coronary disease and cardiomyopathic phenomena. We have previously shown that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) prevents coronary perimicrovascular fibrosis in genetically obese mice that develop insulin resistance. This study was performed to elucidate mechanism(s) implicated and to determine the effects of attenuation of angiotensin II (Ang) II. Genetically obese ob/ob mice were given ACE inhibitor (temocapril) or Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blocker (olmesartan) from 10 to 20 weeks. Cardiac expressions of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, the major physiologic inhibitor of fibrinolysis, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1), a prototypic profibrotic molecule, were determined and extent of perivascular coronary fibrosis was measured. Twenty-week-old obese mice exhibited increased plasma levels of PAI-1 and TGF-beta(1) compared with the values in lean counterpart. Perivascular coronary fibrosis in arterioles and small arteries was evident in obese mice that also showed increased left ventricular collagen as measured by hydroxyproline assay. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the deposition of perivascular type 1 collagen. Markedly increased PAI-1 and TGF-beta were seen immunohistochemically in coronary vascular wall and confirmed by western blotting. When obese mice were treated with temocapril or olmesartan from 10 to 20 weeks, both were equally effective and prevented increases in perivascular fibrosis, plasma PAI-1 and TGF-beta(1), left ventricular collagen and mural immunoreactivity for PAI-1, TGF-beta and collagen type 1. The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activity was elevated in the left ventricle of obese mice (western) and blocked by temocapril and olmesartan. Ang II-mediated upregulation of PAI-1 and TGF-beta(1) with collagen deposition may explain the mechanism of perivascular fibrosis in obese mice. ACE inhibition and blockade of AT(1) receptor may prevent coronary perivascular fibrosis and collagen deposition even before development of overt diabetes. JNK activation may be a mediator of obesity-related cardiac dysfunction and a potential therapeutic target.",

        "abstract": "We have investigated the effects of prior activation of afferent inputs by a train of low-frequency stimulation (LFS) on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation (tetanus, 100 Hz, 100 pulses) in CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices. The parameters of the LFS were altered systematically: the frequency (1 or 5 Hz); the number of pulses (80, 200 or 1000); and the time lag from the LFS to the tetanus (20, 60 or 100 min). Conditioning effects of the LFS on the induction of LTP were evaluated in terms of the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (S-EPSP) and the amplitude of the population spike (A-PS). LTP could reliably be induced by 100 Hz tetanic stimulation delivered to a naive slice. In contrast, the attempt to induce LTP 60 min after LFS of 200 or 1000 pulses at 1 Hz resulted only in short-term potentiation while the LFS itself produced no significant change in the responses. The suppressive effect on LTP was significantly reduced for 1 Hz LFS with a smaller number of pulses (80 pulses), or a shorter (20 min) or longer (100 min) time lag from the LFS to the tetanus, or with LFS at a higher frequency (5 Hz). When the LFS of 1000 pulses at 1 Hz was delivered in the presence of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist AP5 (D,L-4-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, 50 ��M), which was washed out after the end of the LFS, the tetanus given 60 min after application of the LFS produced stable LTP, indicating the involvement of NMDA receptor/channels in the mechanisms of this particular form of synaptic plasticity - long-term suppression of LTP.",

Coronary angiogram showed no significant stenoses. Immediately after 20 microg acetylcholine infusion in the right coronary artery, angiographic no-flow, ischemic electrocardiographic changes, and anginal pain developed in the absence of epicardial coronary obstruction. While intracoronary infusion of isosorbide dinitrate was only partially effective, intracoronary infusion of nicorandil, an agent known to improve coronary microcirculation, completely resolved these changes. This is the first case reported so far suggesting that enhanced insulin response may be associated with acetylcholine-induced microvascular vasoconstriction. Microvascular vasoconstriction must be considered when a patient with insulin resistance presents with chest pain.",

        "abstract": "Recent molecular biological studies have identified podoplanin as a candidate cancer stem cell (CSC) marker in squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). The purpose of this study was to examine the expression pattern of podoplanin, and the other stem cell markers CD44 and p63, and their relationship to clinico-pathological features including survival in pulmonary SqCC. We examined histologically the expression of podoplanin, CD44, and p63 in 162 consecutive SqCC by immunostaining. Podoplanin expression was observed in 107 (66%) tumors, CD44 in 145 (89.5%), and p63 in 151 (93.2%), respectively. In 95.3% of the podoplanin-positive tumors, tumor cells showing strong expression were localized in the periphery of the tumor nests. However, this peripheral localization was observed in only 55.9% of the CD44-positive and 43% of p63-positive tumors. In 88.8% of the podoplanin-positive tumors, positive cells were localized more peripherally in the tumor nests than CD44- or p63-positive cells and when CD44 and p63 expressions were compared in these podoplanin-positive tumors, p63-positive layers in the periphery of the tumor nests were broader compared to CD44-positive layers. These findings suggest tumor cells are aligned in the \"hierarchical distribution pattern\" according to the expression of these three markers. Patients who had podoplanin-positive tumors with the \"hierarchical pattern\" resulted in significantly better overall survival than those who had podoplanin-negative tumors (P = 0.043). These results suggest that podoplanin expression would reflect the most immature status in the differentiation process of SqCC, and SqCC with hierarchical expression would be a well-organized tumor group with lower biological aggressiveness based on the CSC concept.",

        "abstract": "Both activation of platelets and elevation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) activity in plasma have been associated with acute myocardial infarction. Growth factors from platelet alpha-granules have been shown to increase PAI-1 synthesis in liver and endothelial cells in culture. The present study was designed to determine whether activation of platelets in vivo increases PAI-1 activity in plasma, thereby potentially attenuating thrombolysis. Carotid arteries in rabbits were stimulated with transluminal anodal current to initiate thrombosis manifested initially by cyclic flow variations known to reflect platelet activation. Flow was monitored with Doppler flow probes. Plasma PAI-1 activity (mean +/- SEM) assayed spectrophotometrically increased from 6.8 +/- 0.8 arbitrary units (AU)/ml to a peak of 19.1 +/- 2.9 AU/ml (n = 15) 4.8 +/- 0.6 h after the onset of cyclic flow variations. The magnitude of peak PAI-1 values correlated closely with the frequency and duration of antecedent cyclic flow variations. Complete thrombotic occlusion did not elevate PAI-1 beyond that seen with severe, repetitive partial occlusions (18.7 +/- 4.6 vs. 19.6 +/- 3.8 AU/ml). However, when recanalization of completely occluded vessels was induced with tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasma PAI-1 increased more markedly (from 5.6 +/- 0.7 to 112.8 +/- 22.3 AU/ml, n = 11), exceeding the increase after corresponding intervals in animals in which t-PA failed to induce recanalization (from 5.2 +/- 1.1 to 28.3 +/- 6.1 AU/ml, n = 6). Thus, activation of platelets accompanying thrombosis or thrombolysis, or both, markedly increases PAI-1 activity in plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Long-term blockade of nitric oxide synthesis with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) induces cardiac perivascular fibrosis in rats. Its relationship to expression of angiogenic growth factors and capillary network remodeling is not understood. This study was designed to determine whether capillary proliferation and angiogenic growth factor regulation occur in response to L-NAME. Three groups of rats were studied: C, control; L1, L-NAME 13 mg/kg/day; L2, 130 mg/kg/day. One and eight weeks later the hearts were removed and subjected to morphometric analysis and analysis of gene expressions of molecules related to angiogenesis. Arterial hypertension was observed within 8 weeks in the L1 and L2 groups compared with control. After 1 week immunohistochemical assays demonstrated basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the arteriolar media. Northern blot analysis revealed increase in bFGF and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) mRNA during this period. At 8 weeks arteriolar medial thickening and perivascular fibrosis were seen microscopically in the L1 and L2 groups, which were accompanied by only a modest remodeling of capillary network due to increase in venular or intermediate capillary portions. Concomitantly immunoreactivity for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and TGF-beta were detected in perivascular area. These results suggest that (1) blockade of NO synthesis induces expression of angiogenic growth factors as well as vessel wall remodeling, and (2) TGF-beta may counteract angiogenic growth factors and limit subsequent alterations in capillary network remodeling.",

        "abstract": "A standard chemotherapy regimen for neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract (GI-NEC) has not been established. Treatment usually consists of platinum doublets, consistent with the standard treatment for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), with which it shares clinicopathological similarities. Here, we retrospectively examined responses of five GI-NEC patients treated with amrubicin chloride (AMR) which has shown activity against SCLC as salvage therapy.Five patients with histologically proven unresectable GI-NEC in whom previous chemotherapy regimens had failed were treated with AMR, a synthetic anthracycline with potent topoisomerase II inhibition.Primary tumors were located in the esophagus in three patients, anus in one, and colon in one. AMR was administered intravenously at 35-40 mg/m(2) on days 1-3 every 3 weeks for a median of six treatment cycles (range, 2-8). Although all patients had received one to four previous chemotherapy regimens, including cisplatin doublets, three of five achieved objective responses to AMR. All three had esophageal NEC in relapse following combination treatment with irinotecan plus cisplatin. The most common adverse events of ≥ grade 3 were neutropenia (75%), anemia (60%), thrombocytopenia (20%), and febrile neutropenia (20%).Single-agent AMR achieved objective responses in three of five patients with GI-NEC. This compound may be a candidate for prospective evaluation in a larger series.",

        "abstract": "The biological actions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are mediated by 2 distinct receptors, TNF-RI (p55) and TNF-RII (p75). The extracellular domains of both receptors are shed in soluble form (sTNF-RI and sTNF-RII). The soluble receptors are involved in regulating TNF-alpha activities and may have therapeutic potential as TNF-neutralizing agents. However, it remains unclear as to what kind of physiological molecule can regulate TNF receptors. Nitric oxide (NO) mediates a variety of biological and pathophysiological functions. We hypothesized that NO may modulate the expression and shedding of TNF-RI. An NO donor, diethylamine/NO complex (NOC 5), increased sTNF-RI in the supernatants of ECV304, a human umbilical vein cell line, in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-RI mRNA in these cells was upregulated by NOC 5. 8-Br-cGMP and peroxynitrate had no effect on sTNF-RI release. Genistein and herbimycin A, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, inhibited sTNF-RI release. Herbimycin A inhibited the levels of TNF-RI mRNA enhanced by NOC 5, which downregulated the surface expression of TNF-RI, indicating that NO is also involved in the shedding process of TNF-RI. The shedding of TNF-RI was abolished by a synthetic inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase, KB-R8301. In conclusion, NO enhanced the release of sTNF-RI from endothelial cells by a cGMP-independent mechanism. Dual pathways suggested for NO-induced sTNF-RI release include (1) enhanced expression of TNF-RI, at least partially, by a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism and (2) increased shedding of TNF-RI by a type of metalloproteinase.",
