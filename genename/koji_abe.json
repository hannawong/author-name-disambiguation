        "abstract": "We previously reported that a T-786-->C polymorphism in the 5'-flanking region of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene and smoking were independently associated with coronary spasm; however, the interaction between this polymorphism and smoking remains to be elucidated.We analyzed 209 men and 238 women who were admitted consecutively at our institution; all subjects received an intracoronary injection of acetylcholine (ACh) while undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of chest pain: all subjects had no significant coronary stenosis. We divided these subjects into four groups: non-smokers with T/T genotype (Control Group A); non-smokers with C/T or C/C genotype (Group B); smokers with T/T genotype (Group C); and smokers with C/T or C/C genotype (Group D). We further examined quantitative coronary angiographies of the left anterior descending coronary artery in a subset of 54 consecutive men and 53 consecutive women.The frequencies of coronary spasm in Group B (male: 61%, female: 78%), Group C (62%, 59%) and Group D (91%, 92%) were significantly higher than in Group A (30%, 38%). In the males, ACh-induced vasoconstriction was greatest in Group D, and the change was weakest in Group A. In the females, ACh-induced vasoconstrictions were significantly greater in Groups B, C and D than in Group A. The T-786-->C polymorphism and smoking combine to increase the risk of coronary spasm.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure and was investigated in the present study of the role of exogenous A-type natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the patients with heart failure and in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.The first protocol was to examine if an infusion of human ANP (carperitide) changed serum levels of TRX (thioredoxin) during the treatment of patients with heart failure compared with conventional therapy using furosemide. Protocol 2 investigated whether ANP had a direct antioxidant action on the failing heart by measuring TRX gene expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In Protocol 1, 8 patients were treated with only an intravenous bolus of furosemide and 11 patients with only an intravenous infusion of carperitide for 24 h. Serum TRX levels significantly decreased at 4 h (p<0.03) and at 24 h (p<0.05) in the carperitide group, whereas they decreased slightly but were not significantly different in the furosemide group. In Protocol 2, it was found that a low dose of exogenous ANP of 10(-9) mol/L significantly suppressed TRX expression and ROS production in cardiomyocytes.Carperitide infusion has a predominantly antioxidant action, in addition to improving the hemodynamics of patients with acute heart failure. Furthermore, carperitide infusion should have a direct antioxidant effect on the failing heart.",

        "abstract": "We previously found a -786T/C polymorphism in the 5'-flanking region of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene and reported that this polymorphism is strongly associated with coronary spasm. In this study, we examined whether the polymorphism is a prognostic marker in coronary spasm patients.We examined the clinical courses of 201 consecutive patients with coronary spasm who were admitted to our institution: 146 patients with the -786T/T genotype; 50 patients with the -786C/T genotype; and five patients with the -786C/C genotype. The mean follow-up period was 76+/-60 months. All the patients took calcium channel blockers and/or nitrate during the follow-up period. In this study, no patients died due to a cardiac event. About 25 patients were readmitted owing to cardiovascular disease. Out of these 25 patients, 23 patients were readmitted owing to a reattack of coronary spasm. The -786C allele was significantly associated with readmission due to coronary spasm (P=0.0072, odds ratio: 3.37 in the dominant effect). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the occurrence of readmission was significantly higher in the patients with the -786C allele than in the patients without the -786C allele (P=0.0079). Further, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the -786T/C polymorphism was an independent predictor for readmission due to reattack of coronary spasm (P=0.006; relative risk=3.590).The eNOS -786C allele is an independent risk factor for readmission due to a recurrent attack of coronary spasm in patients with coronary spasm, even if the patients have taken calcium channel blockers and/or nitrate.",

        "abstract": "We identified a -786T>C polymorphism in the eNOS gene, and this polymorphism was strongly associated with coronary spasm. The present study aimed to elucidate whether the -786T>C polymorphism or acetylcholine (ACh)-induced coronary spasm affects serum nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels. The study population comprised three groups: (i) 26 patients without coronary spasm in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with the T/T genotype (group A); (ii) 20 patients with coronary spasm in the LAD with the T/T genotype (group B); and (iii) 16 patients with coronary spasm in the LAD with the C/T genotype (group C). Paired blood samples were obtained from the coronary sinus (CS) and the aortic tract (Ao) before and after an intracoronary injection of ACh. Serum NOx and plasma lactate levels were measured. The delta NOx level was calculated as the serum concentration of NOx in the CS minus that in the Ao. We compared lactate extraction ratios (LERs) and delta NOx levels between the three groups. The LERs after the provocation test in groups A, B and C were 18.9+/-2.4%, -0.5+/-3.9% and -13.5+/-4.2%, respectively. The LER in group C was significantly lower than in group B. The delta NOx levels after the provocation test in groups A, B and C were 11.5+/-1.7 micromol/l, 10.4+/-3.5 micromol/l and -2.1+/-4.8 micromol/l, respectively. The delta NOx levels in group C were significantly lower (P<0.05). Although the NOx level was significantly increased after the provocation test in group A (P<0.05), the NOx level was significantly decreased after the provocation test in group C (P=0.001). In group B, the provocation test did not significantly change the delta NOx level. In conclusion, the -786T>C polymorphism reduces the NOx level from the heart due to an intracoronary injection of ACh, and thereby predisposes the patients to severe coronary spasm.",

        "abstract": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) increase endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, although the precise mechanism of this statin induced increase in NO production remains to be elucidated. We examined endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA levels, mRNA stability and the transcriptional activities of the eNOS gene in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with fluvastatin and simvastatin. We further examined whether the effects of these statins differ dependent upon the -786T>C polymorphism in the eNOS gene, and whether these statins affect gene expression of replication protein A1 (RPA1), which is known to reduce the transcriptional activity of the eNOS gene with the -786C allele. Utilizing the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, fluvastatin significantly increased eNOS mRNA levels and mRNA stability, and decreased RPA1 mRNA levels. Luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that fluvastatin significantly increased the transcriptional activity of the eNOS gene. The effect of fluvastatin was stronger in the -786C/C genotype than in the -786T/T genotype. Simvastatin increased eNOS mRNA levels and mRNA stability, but did not affect the transcriptional activity of the eNOS gene. Fluvastatin increased eNOS mRNA levels by enhancing both the transcriptional activity and mRNA stability. The effect of fluvastatin on the transcriptional activity was augmented in the -786C/C genotype, probably because of a decrease in RPA1 gene expression. Simvastatin increased eNOS mRNA levels only by enhancing mRNA stability. The present study suggests that fluvastatin increases endothelial NO activity and thus may be more beneficial to patients with the -786C allele.",

        "abstract": "A previous report showed that aldosterone upregulates angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene expression levels in cultured neonatal rat cardiocytes. ACE2 is a novel homologue of ACE, which exists in the human heart, and ACE2 converts angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9 and angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, thereby decreasing angiotensin II levels. In the present study, an investigation took place to see whether aldosterone regulates the expression of ACE2 as well as that of ACE in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured with aldosterone. Total RNA was extracted from these cardiomyocytes and quantified the mRNA levels of ACE2, ACE and GAPDH by using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Aldosterone significantly decreased ACE2 mRNA levels and increased ACE mRNA levels at 12 h. Angiotensin II, however, had no effect on either ACE2 mRNA levels or ACE mRNA levels. Eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, completely blocked the increase in ACE mRNA levels and the reduction in ACE2 mRNA levels due to aldosterone.Aldosterone, but not angiotensin II, reduced ACE2 mRNA levels and increased ACE mRNA levels in rat cardiomyocytes via mineralocorticoid receptor. Aldosterone might play an important role in cardiac remodeling by upregulating ACE and downregulating ACE2 levels.",

        "abstract": "Coronary spasm plays an important role in the pathogenesis of variant angina and also ischemic heart diseases in general, and it is more likely to occur in angiographically normal coronary arteries than in stenotic coronary arteries. We previously found a -786T/C polymorphism in the 5'-flanking region of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene and reported that this polymorphism is associated with coronary spasm. We report on an investigation of the genetic factor(s) associated with coronary spasm utilizing a genome-wide case-control study.We recruited 411 consecutive Japanese women (201 with coronary spasm; 210 controls) who were all underwent an acetylcholine provocation test. For single nucleotide polymorphism analysis (SNP), 116,204 SNPs were genotyped for 100 women (50 with coronary spasm; 50 controls) utilizing the Affymetrix GeneChip 100 K Set. Case-control studies were performed with 311 women (151 with coronary spasm; 160 controls) using the 10 lowest permutation P value SNPs from the initial SNP analysis. Finally, we discovered SNP rs10498345, a genetic marker for coronary spasm in Japanese women (Odds ratio=0.43, P=9.48x10(-7)). Haplotype analysis showed that haplotype H2, the only haplotype containing the protective A allele at SNP rs10498345, was most strongly associated with coronary spasm (permutation P value <1x10(-4)). SNP rs10498345 was strongly associated with the vasoconstrictor response to acetylcholine. Northern blot analysis revealed a novel 4.7 kb RNA transcript, which lacked poly (A), nearby SNP rs10498345.SNP rs10498345 was strongly associated with coronary spasm in Japanese women utilizing genome-wide SNP analysis.",

        "abstract": "Polyrotaxane fiber and polyrotaxane/cellulose blend fibers were prepared by wet-spinning of the polyrotaxane or polyrotaxane/cellulose blend solution dissolved in the new solvent system, i.e. dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride (DMAc/LiCl), into methanol and a subsequent annealing. In the resultant polyrotaxane/cellulose fiber, some undissolved rodlike cellulose microcrystals were oriented along with the fiber axis, resulting in formation of nanocomposite-like structure. From tensile measurements, it was found that the Young's modulus and tensile strength of the fibers with polyrotaxane/cellulose ratio of 1:1 and 2:1 were higher than those of the pure cellulose fiber. Although the mechanical properties of the fiber with polyrotaxane/cellulose ratio of 4:1 and the pure polyrotaxane fiber were lower than those of the pure cellulose fiber, these fibers showed significantly large strain at break (up to 90% strain), presumably due to the sliding of the cyclodextrin rings of the polyrotaxane in the fibers.",

Intensive\n focal adhesion patches and an elongated cortical actin cytoskeleton were observed after 24\u00a0hours\u2019 cultivation. Proliferation\n assays of MC3T3-E1 cells cultivated on Fol-8Col for 2\u00a0weeks revealed no consistent differences in rate and pattern compared\n to growth on type I collagen.

After a 1-week incubation, PEC made from polysaccharides having carboxyl groups as polyanions showed low viability of NHOst on it although the NHOst on it showed an enhancement in their differentiation level. On the other hand, NHOst on PEC made from sulfated or phosphated polysaccharides showed similar attachment and morphology to those on the collagen-coated dish. When the number of NHOst was estimated after 1 week, the number on the PEC was ranged from 70% to 130% of those on the collagen-coated dish, indicating few effects of these PEC on cell proliferation. In addition, NHOst on PEC films made from sulfated polysaccharides differentiated to a level very similar to that observed on the collagen-coated dish, indicating that these PEC films maintain the normal potential of NHOst to both proliferate and differentiate. Measurement of gap junctional intercellular communication of NHOst on PEC revealed that PEC did not inhibit communication, suggesting that PEC films have few effects on cell homeostasis. Thus, PEC made from the sulfated polysaccharide may be a useful material as a new scaffold for bone regeneration.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we examined the cellular and molecular responses of fibroblasts cultured on a polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) derived from sulfated chitin as a polyanion and chitosan as a polycation. On PEC-coated dishes, the fibroblasts aggregated and then developed spheroid-like structures. At earlier stages of culture, DNA synthesis of cells cultured on PEC was stimulated approximately 75% higher than control cells. Among various signaling molecules examined, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, Akt/PKB and p53, an extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was selectively and constitutively phosphorylated in cells cultured on PEC. The constitutive phosphorylation of ERK was derived from an activation of the ERK kinase MEK, but not from an inactivation of the ERK phosphatase MKP-1. Furthermore, ERK phosphorylation was almost abolished by a membrane receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The enhanced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, a downstream molecule of integrins, was also observed in cells cultured on PEC. These results suggest that fibroblasts recognize PEC as a continuous mitogenic stimulant which results in the constitutive activation of the MEK-ERK pathway toward mitogenesis. Further, PEC interacts with the cell membrane leading to activation of membrane molecules, including integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases. These responses may account, at least in part, for the potential use of PEC as a biomaterial for tissue regeneration.",

The PEC was composed of chitosan as a polycation, with carboxymethyl (CPEC) or sulfated chitin (SPEC). Asc-2P (0.2 mM) inhibited the growth of HPLF on CPEC, but promoted the growth on SPEC. Moreover, the aggregation of HPLF on CPEC was inhibited by Asc-2P, but that on SPEC was induced in the presence of Asc-2P and Dex. Although Asc-2P reduced an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity of HPLF on CPEC as well, it induced a twofold increase in ALPase activities on SPEC and TCD. Furthermore, in the medium containing Asc-2P and 100 mM of Dex, cell growth was inhibited, but ALPase activity was promoted on both SPEC and TCD to form many aggregates on SPEC. ALPase activity increased by twofold over that of HPLF cultured in the medium containing only Asc-2P. Therefore, it is suggested that the cell functions of HPLF are controlled by the combination of PEC and additives.",

For the purpose of the creation of a new functional polysaccharide, we introduced a sulfate group in hyaluronan (Hya) of high molecular weight, and SHya of high molecular weight could be obtained for the first time. When rat calvarial osteoblast (rOB) cells were cultured with a high concentration of SHya, they formed aggregated spheroids after 4h and the spheroids grew to about 200microm after 24h. We examined the expression of cell adhesion molecules in order to clarify the mechanism of aggregate formation. The N-cadherin (N-cad) and Connexin43 (Cx43) expression level of rOB cells cultured with SHya remarkably increased after 2h. A difference in the expression of Integrin beta1 (Intbeta1) could not be observed between the SHya addition and control group. The alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity of rOB cells cultured with SHya after 8h was significantly enhanced in comparison with control. Therefore, the sulfate group of SHya seems to enhance expression of cell adhesion protein such as N-cad and Cx43, resulting in aggregate formation and further remarkable induction of the ALPase activity of rOB cells.",

In contrast, using polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) as a matrix, HPLF showed spreading, round, and aggregate forms. Cells of the inner part of the aggregate contacted with each other to form a three-dimensional structure, and this condition corresponded to typical tissues in vivo. These seemed to be related to the interrelation between growth and morphology; that is, the HPLF of the spreading form was considered to belong to a proliferation phase, and the HPLF of the round and aggregate forms, with a little growth, seemed to belong to a functional phase of the cell cycle, indicating that PEC is able to control such cell functions as proliferation, morphology, and differentiation. The cell aggregate was observed only on PEC with carboxymethyl residues and was stained by alizarin red (AR), which suggested mineralization. The spreading cells on PEC containing sulfate residues were not stained by AR. Therefore, it was found that there was a certain relationship between cell growth and morphology, and that PEC affected the cell cycle and promoted proliferation and differentiation of HPLF.",

        "abstract": "Cell functions in vivo are stimulated by extracellular matrices, vitamins, growth factors, and hormones. In this paper, the effects of glucocorticoids, dexamethasone (Dex), and Cortexrone (Cor) on the growth and differentiation of human periodontal ligament fibroblast (HPLF) were discussed in relation to a polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) consisting of polysaccharides (chitin, cellulose derivatives, and chitosan) as a tissue-culture material. A Dex-treatment at a concentration of 10(-)-10(-7) M inhibited one-half of HPLF growth in comparison with 10(-9) M Dex-treatment and no additive medium and produced aggregates on the chitosan-sulfated chitin PEC (SPECs) with regard to the degree of sulfate substitution. On the chitosan-sulfated cellulose PEC, 10(-7)-10(-9) M Dex-treatment promoted HPLF growth and inhibited the production of aggregates. On the other hand, a Cor-treatment, a mineral corticoid, which inhibits the interaction between Dex and its receptor, increased HPLF growth on SPEC141, but the HPLF did not construct aggregates. A Dex and Cor mixture-treatment inhibited one-third HPLF growth in comparison with 10(-5) M Dex-treatment and produced aggregates on PEC. The cooperative effect of both the culture material and hormones was found to control HPLF growth and morphology. The alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activities of HPLF increased with an increase in the Dex and Cor concentration. The value of Dex-treated HPLF ALPase activity demonstrated a two-fold increase from that with Cor-treatment. The ALPase activity of Dex and Cor mixture-treated HPLF on PEC decreased with an increase in the Cor concentration, because Cor increased HPLF growth on PEC. In using carboxymethylated chitin derivatives as the polyanion, HPLF decreased in cell growth and produced aggregates in the absence of the additives, suggesting that PEC induces HPLF differentiation using only the stimulation of the material surface.",

        "abstract": "Ti and Ti alloys are widely used as metallic implants, because of their good mechanical properties and nontoxic behavior. However, they have problems as the implant-materials, namely, high Young's modulus comparing that of bone and low bonding ability with bone. There is a need to develop the Ti and Ti alloys with lower Young's modulus and good bonding ability. In previous study, Ti composite containing biodegradable poly- l -lactic-acid (PLLA) fiber has been fabricated to improve these problems. However, this composite has low strength because of the imperfect sintering of Ti matrix. To improve its strength, sintering of Ti matrix should be completed. In this study, Ti\u2013NaCl composite material was fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) method using powder mixture of Ti and NaCl to complete the sintering of Ti matrix. To obtain porous Ti samples, Ti\u2013NaCl composite were put into hot water of 317 K. The porous Ti was dipped into PLLA melt in order to introduce PLLA into the pores of porous Ti. Finally, Ti/PLLA composite was obtained, and PLLA plays a role as reinforcement of Ti matrix. It was found that the Ti/PLLA composite has gradient structure and mechanical properties.",

        "abstract": "Thin films of functional organic compound, fullerene (C60) are fabricated on the (001) surfaces of alkali halides (NaCl, KCl and KBr) and mica by an organic molecular beam deposition (OMBD) technique. Pure powder samples are sublimated from the precisely temperature-controlled Knudsen cell (K-cell) at a pressure of 10 \u22127 Torr and deposited onto the substrates kept in the range of 25\u2013350\u00b0C for 1\u201310 min. They tended to grow epitaxially. Dependence of crystal sizes and distances between adjacent fine islands on the temperatures of K-cell and substrates is evaluated by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). With increasing K-cell temperature and decreasing substrate temperature, size and distance tend to decrease. The relationship between these rates and the substrate temperature represents the activation energies for crystal growth of 6.2\u201311 kJ/mol and surface diffusion of 3.7\u201311 kJ/mol. Particularly in the case of C60 films formed on the rough surface of alkali halides, although molecules tended to start the nucleation at the edge of steps, they formed the lines of nuclei arranging along to the edge on the wide terrace. The numerical evaluation of the distances between the neighboring nuclei represented the diffusion length of C60 molecules along the one-dimensional step edge and along the normal direction to the step edge.",

Studies on intermacromolecular complexes are mainly concerned with the elucidation of various reactions in vivo essential for the maintenance of life. They also provide indispensable information on the production of new macromolecular materials.\n In this review, the results of fundamental studies on the characteristics of intermacromolecular complexes considering their formation, structure and physical and chemical properties are systematically discussed. These complexes are divided into four classes on the basis of their main interaction forces, i.e. polyelectrolyte complexes, hydrogen-bonding complexes, stereocomplexes and charge-transfer complexes. The cooperative phenomena of the formation of intermacromolecular complexes are also discussed quantitatively. Moreover, up-to-date topics from various fields and their various possibilities of application for future developments are mentioned.\n \n ",

        "abstract": "This is the first report about a patient with concomitant polymyositis (PM), myasthenia gravis (MG), and aplastic anemia (AA). A 54-year-old male developed myalgia and muscle weakness, which gradually progressed over 2 months. He was persistently affected by MG and AA. Brachium magnetic resonance imaging showed increased signal intensity in the left triceps and deltoid muscles on short tau inversion recovery images. A muscle biopsy examination revealed perifascicular atrophication and inflammatory myopathy. We diagnosed the patient with PM combined with MG and AA. He was successfully treated with an autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The present case suggests that BMT is a therapeutic option for PM, MG, and AA.",

He revealed moderate mental retardation, parkinsonism, and spastic paralysis with levodopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) supplementation from the age of 2 months. Brain MRI showed high intensity areas in bilateral frontal and posterior deep white matter on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Coronal FLAIR image showed a high signal in bilateral pyramidal tracts. Single photon computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of the dopamine transporter was normal. This imaging indicates no dopaminergic cell loss. Our patient had no motor fluctuations or dyskinesias. Early diagnosis and replacement treatment might lead to a favorable outcome.",

An 80-year-old female had a 4-year history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and an 11-year history of rheumatoid arthritis, which was treated with prednisolone, tacrolimus, and methotrexate. One month after the removal of a dental implant, she complained of a disturbance of consciousness and suffered a convulsion. A cerebrospinal fluid culture was found to be positive for both  S. mitis  and  N. subflava . After 14 days of antibiotic treatment with 4 g/day ceftriaxone, her stiff neck, somnolence, and laboratory data greatly improved, and she was successfully discharged at 27 days after admission. Although both  S. mitis  and  N. subflava  are generally considered to be benign bacteria, they can cause meningitis in patients with the following risk factors: older age, on immunosuppressive treatment, DM, or dental treatment.",

        "abstract": "Somatic cells can be directly converted into induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) by defined transcription factors. However, the therapeutic effect of undifferentiated iNSCs on ischemic stroke has not been demonstrated. In this study, we used a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). iNSCs (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105) were injected directly into the ipsilateral striatum and cortex 24 h after tMCAO. Histological analysis was performed at 7 days, 28 days, and 8 months after tMCAO. We found that iNSC transplantation successfully improved the survival rate of stroke model mice with significant functional recovery from the stroke. The fate of engrafted iNSCs was that the majority of iNSCs had differentiated into astroglial cells but not into neural cells in both the sham-operated brain and the poststroke brain without forming a tumor up to 8 months after tMCAO. Our data suggest that the directly converted iNSCs can be regarded as a candidate of safe cell resource for transplantation therapy in patients suffering from ischemic stroke.",

        "abstract": "Recent genetic studies yielded conflicting results regarding a role for the variant chromogranin B (CHGB)P413L allele as a disease modifier in ALS. Moreover, potential deleterious effects of the CHGBP413L variant in ALS pathology have not been investigated. Here we report that in transfected cultured cells, the variant CHGBL413 protein exhibited aberrant properties including mislocalization, failure to interact with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and defective secretion. The CHGBL413 transgene in SOD1G37R mice precipitated disease onset and pathological changes related to misfolded SOD1 specifically in female mice. However, the CHGBL413 variant also slowed down disease progression in SOD1G37R mice, which is in line with a very slow disease progression that we report for a Swedish woman with ALS who is carrier of two mutant SOD1D90A alleles and two variant CHGBP413L and CHGBR458Q alleles. In contrast, overexpression of the common CHGBP413 allele in SOD1G37R mice did not affect disease onset but significantly accelerated disease progression and pathological changes. As in transgenic mice, the CHGBP413L allele conferred an earlier ALS disease onset in women of Japanese and French Canadian origins with less effect in men. Evidence is presented that the sex-dependent effects of CHGBL413 allelic variant in ALS may arise from enhanced neuronal expression of CHGB in females because of a sex-determining region Y element in the gene promoter. Thus, our results suggest that CHGB variants may act as modifiers of onset and progression in some ALS populations and especially in females because of higher expression levels compared to males.",

        "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 is a late-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome with motor neuron degeneration that is caused by expansions of a hexanucleotide repeat (GGCCTG) in the noncoding region of NOP56 gene, with a histopathological feature of RNA foci formation in postmortem tissues. Here, we report a cellular model using the spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We generated iPSCs from spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 patients and differentiated them into neurons. The number of RNA-foci-positive cells was increased in patient iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons. Treatment of the 2'-O, 4'-C-ethylene-bridged nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting NOP56 pre-mRNA reduced RNA-foci-positive cells to \u223c50% in patient iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons. NOP56 mRNA expression levels were lower in patient iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons than in healthy control neurons. One of the ASOs reduced the number of RNA-foci-positive cells without altering NOP56 mRNA expression levels in patient iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons. These data show that iPSCs from spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 patients can be useful for evaluating the effects of ASOs toward GGCCTG repeat expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 36.",

Now we can prepare various kinds of neuronal cells directly induced from somatic cells. It has been reported that overexpression of a neuron-specific transcriptional factors might change the cell fate of endogenous astroglia to neuronal cells in vivo. In addition, some research groups demonstrated that chemical compound can induce chemical-induced neuronal cells, without transcriptional factors overexpression. In this review, we briefly review recent progress in the induced neuronal (iN) cells, and discuss the possibility of application for cell transplantation therapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal degenerating disease, characterized by progressive muscular atrophy without any effective treatment. Here, we demonstrated the efficacy of abrograting autophagy in motor neurons (MN) by treatment with n-butylidenephthalide (n-BP) in ALS transgenic mice (SOD1 G93A ). Pre-symptomatic oral administration of 250\u00a0mg/kg/bid n-BP significantly prolonged the survival period (203.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.3 days), improved motor function, and attenuated MN loss compared to vehicle control (126.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2 days). This prolonged survival of ALS mice is much more robust than that reported with riluzole (140 days), which is an approved clinical therapy for ALS. The therapeutic mechanism targeted by n-BP involved the autophagic pathway as evidenced by decreased LC3-II expression (a biomarker of autophagy), enhanced mTOR levels, and attenuated autophagic activity, altogether increasing MN survival in a dose-dependent manner. This result was also confirmed by double transgenic mice (SOD1 G93A :LC3-GFP) which showed that oral administration of n-BP reduced GFP density and decreased caspase-3 expression. In addition, electron microscopy revealed that n-BP administration not only decreased autophagosome number but also reduced morphological dysfunction of mitochondria. In summary, these results indicate that down-regulation of autophagy activation via n-BP may pose as a therapeutic regimen for ALS and relevant neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurological disease, and the etiology of sporadic ALS is generally unknown. The TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) gene was identified as an ALS gene contributing to a predisposition toward ALS. To reveal the frequency and characteristics of variants of the TBK1 gene in sporadic ALS patients in Japan, we analyzed the TBK1 gene by exome sequencing in a large Japanese cohort of 713 sporadic ALS patients and 800 controls. We identified known or potentially toxic rare variants of TBK1 gene in 9 patients (1.26%) with sporadic ALS, including 4 novel missense variants (p.V23I, p.H322R, p.R358C, and p.T478I) and 3 loss-of-function variants (p.R357X, p.P378_I379del, and p.T419_G420del). The odds ratio between sporadic ALS patients and controls was 10.2 (p\u00a0= 0.008, 95% confidence interval\u00a0= 1.67-62.47). These findings support the contribution of TBK1 to the etiology of sporadic ALS in Japanese patients.",

        "abstract": "Bone marrow (BM) cells from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients show significantly reduced expression of several neurotrophic factors. Monotherapy with either wild-type (WT) BM transplantation (BMT) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) has only a small clinical therapeutic effect in an ALS mouse model, due to the phenomenon of neuroprotection. In this study, we investigated the clinical benefits of combination therapy using BMT with WT BM cells, plus GCSF after disease onset in ALS mice [transgenic mice expressing human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) bearing a G93A mutation]. Combined treatment with BMT and GCSF delayed disease progression and prolonged the survival of G93A mice, whereas BMT or GCSF treatment alone did not. Histological study of the ventral horns of lumbar cords from G93A mice treated with BMT and GCSF showed a reduction in motor neuron loss coupled with induced neuronal precursor cell proliferation, increased expression of neurotrophic factors (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor and angiogenin), and neovascularization compared with controls (vehicle only). Compared with G93A microglial cells, most BM-derived WT cells differentiated into microglial cells and strongly expressed neurotrophic factors, combined BMT and GCSF treatment led to the replacement of G93A microglial cells with BM-derived WT cells. These results indicate combined treatment with BMT and GCSF has potential neuroprotective and angiogenic effects in ALS mice, induced by the replacement of G93A microglial cells with BM-derived WT cells. Furthermore, this is the first report showing the effects of combined BMT and GCSF treatment on blood vessels in ALS. ",

Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) is an uncommon esophageal motility disorder. We herein report the case of a 68-year-old woman with DES as a partial symptom of AAG. She presented with chronic esophageal transit failure, constipation, and numbness of the hands and feet, Adie's pupil, thermal hypoalgesia, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. Right sural nerve biopsy showed significantly decreased numbers of small myelinated fibers. Barium swallowing X-ray showed repetitive simultaneous contractions indicating DES in the esophagus. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and CT image showed a dilated esophageal lumen and liquid effusion. Simultaneously, serum anti-gAChR-\u03b13-Ab indicating AAG was detected. After pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIg), the bolus progression and liquid effusion improved, suggesting that DES is an important gastrointestinal symptom of AAG.",

JEV genotype V strains have never been detected in Japan to date, but they have been recently detected in South Korea. In the present analysis, we tried to determine if a JEV genotype V strain caused any JE case in Japan in 2016. The serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected from 10 JE patients reported in Japan in 2016. JEV RNA was not detected in any of the samples. Although JEV is a single serotype virus, it can be expected that the neutralizing antibody titers against JEV genotype V strains are higher than those against genotype I and III strains in the sera of JE patients in Japan whose causative JEV was the genotype V strain. The neutralizing antibody titers against the JEV genotype V strain were not higher than those against the genotype I or III strain in any serum samples, indicating that the evidence that the JEV genotype V strain caused any JE case in Japan in 2016 was not shown.",

Acute agitation as an initial manifestation of neuro-Behcet's disease (NBD) is an extremely rare clinical entity. A 44-year-old male, who had been complaining about a severe headache and fever for several days, was admitted to our ED due to acutely presented incontinence and agitation. On admission, physical restraint and sedation with sevoflurane and propofol were required for his combative and violent behavior. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed increased cell count. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging showed a high intensity signal in the left parietal lobe and bilateral occipital lobe. As infectious meningoencephalitis was suspected, empirical therapy was immediately started. He recovered uneventfully without neurological defect in seven days. Based on positive human leukocyte antigen B-51 and clinical manifestations, the diagnosis of NBD was made and remitted by steroid therapy. Although acute NBD commonly presents with focal neurological symptoms, psychiatric symptoms could be considered the first manifestation. A focused and thorough examination coupled with appropriate management strategies can assist emergency clinicians safely and effectively manage these patients.",

We assayed anti-NR1/NR2B IgG antibodies in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid of 62 patients initially diagnosed with mood disorder by a cell-based assay. We also investigated the specific patient characteristics and psychotic symptoms. At first admission, the patients showed only psychiatric symptoms without typical neurological signs or abnormal examination findings. Four of the 62 patients had anti-NR1/NR2B IgG antibodies. The anti-NR1/NR2B IgG antibody-positive patients showed more super- or abnormal sensitivity (P\u202f=\u202f0.00088), catatonia (P\u202f=\u202f0.049), and more conceptual disorganization (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), hostility (P\u202f=\u202f0.0010), suspiciousness (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and less emotional withdrawal (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and motor retardation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale than the antibody-negative patients. During the clinical course, anti-NR1/NR2B IgG antibody-positive patients showed more catatonia (P\u202f=\u202f0.0042) and met Graus's criteria for diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, but negative patients did not. Immunotherapy was effective for anti-NR1/NR2B IgG antibody-positive patients, and there was the weak relationship (R\u00b2\u202f=\u202f0.318) between the anti-NR1/NR2B IgG antibody titer in the cerebrospinal fluid and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score.",

After a preliminary case report of ALS by Masamichi Hirai on 1890, 2 completed reports were simultaneously published within 2 weeks of 1891 by Momojiro Nakamura and Zenjiro Inoue, followed by Eikichi Watanabe's report on 1892. After Shonosuke Hasegawa's and Hiroshi Kawahara's case reports on 1894-1896, Aihiko Sata first reported an autopsy case of ALS on 1897. The great contribution of Kinnosuke Miura was also introduced for the naming and pathogenesis in the early stage of ALS history in Japan during 1893-1911.",

Background:  A novel ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)/spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) crossroad mutation Asidan shows characteristic clinical features.  Design/Methods:  Asidan is also called SCA36, and is caused by a hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of the  NOP56  gene. Clinical, genetic, neuropathologic, and neuroradiologic characteristics of 29 Asidan patients were examined. Histologic evaluation of a muscle biopsy specimen from 1 patient of Asidan, and neuropathologic evaluation of an autopsied brain from another patient of Asidan were also examined.  Results:  The mean age at onset was 53.1 years, with the most frequent symptoms of truncal ataxia (100% of patients), ataxic dysarthria (100%), limb ataxia (93%), and hyperreflexia (79%). Tongue fasciculation and subsequent atrophy were found in 71% of cases, particularly in those of long duration. Skeletal muscle fasciculation and atrophy of the limbs and trunk were found in 57% of cases. Most cases showed normal general cognitive function, but reduced frontal lobe functions, corresponding to frontal lobe atrophy on MRI. Lower motor involvement was confirmed by EMG and muscle biopsy. The neuropathologic study revealed significant cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration with obvious loss of lower motor neurons. Although most patients did not show Parkinsonism, some showed decreases of DAT (dopamine transporter) image.  Conclusions:  The novel ALS/SCA crossroad mutation Asidan (SCA36) showed unique clinical features, such as cerebellar ataxia, progressive motor neuron involvement, frontal cognitive decline, and a potential parkinsonian system involvement.

Meanwhile, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance also lead to a number of pathological processes, including oxidative stress, advanced glycation end products formation, and insulin-signaling impairment in the central nervous system. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors currently in worldwide clinical use for treatment of hyperlipidemia, reduce levels of cortical amyloid \u03b2 and oxidative stress with or without affecting cholesterol levels. As statins show various pleiotropic effects, they have high potential as a therapeutic approach to AD.",

        "abstract": "Recently, aging societies have been showing an increasingly strong relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (HP). In the present study, we created a new mouse model for AD with HP, and investigated its clinical and pathological characteristics. Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice (APP23) were subjected to bilateral common carotid arteries stenosis with ameroid constrictors for slowly progressive cerebral HP. In contrast to simple APP23 mice, cerebral HP exacerbated motor and cognitive dysfunctions with white matter lesions and meningo-parenchymal amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) burdens. Strong cerebrovascular inflammation and severe amyloid angiopathy with cerebrovascular remodeling were also observed in APP23 + HP mouse brains. An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine improved such clinical dysfunctions, retrieved above neuropathological characteristics, and enhanced nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-binding activity. The present study demonstrates that chronic cerebral HP enhanced cognitive/motor dysfunctions with parenchymal/cerebrovascular A\u03b2 accumulation and cerebrovascular remodeling. These neuropathological abnormalities were greatly ameliorated by galantamine treatment associated with nAChR-mediated neuroprotection by allosterically potentiating ligand action. ",

        "abstract": "Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) play important roles in traffic of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, aberrant distributions of components of NPCs were demonstrated in C9orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9-ALS) patients, but it is elusive whether such abnormities are also the case with other cause of ALS disease. In the present study, we investigated the spatiotemporal distributions of RanGAP1 and 4 representative nucleoporins (GP210, NUP205, NUP107 and NUP50) of NPCs in human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 mutation transgenic (SOD1-Tg) mice and sporadic ALS patients. Compared with wild type (WT), these proteins displayed age-dependent and progressive nuclear precipitations, and cytoplasmic aberrant expressions in motor neurons of lumbar cord in SOD1-Tg mice from 10 to 18weeks (W). Double immunofluorescent analysis showed abnormal nuclear retention and apparent co-localizations of RanGAPl with NUP205 and NUP205 with NUPl07, meanwhile, GP210 with NUP205 mainly co-localized in the nuclear envelope (NE) of motor neurons. Furthermore, RanGAP1, GP210 and NUP50 showed similarly abnormal nuclear precipitations and cytoplasmic upregulations in SOD1-Tg mice and ALS patients, moreover, aberrant co-localizations of RanGAP1 with TDP-43 and NUP205 with TDP-43 were also observed in motor neurons. The present study indicated that the mislocalization of these proteins of NPCs may underlie the pathogenesis of ALS both in SOD1-Tg mice and human sporadic ALS patients, and these dysfunctions may be a fundamental pathway for ALS that is not specific only in C9-ALS but also in SOD1-ALS, which may be amenable to pharmacotherapeutic intervention.",

In the present study, we investigated the temporal immunohistochemical distribution of five representative components of NPCs-Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGap1), glycoprotein-210 (Gp210), nucleoporin 205 (Nup205), nucleoporin 107 (Nup107), and nucleoporin 50 (Nup50)-after 90\u2009min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) up to 28 days after the reperfusion in rat brains. Single immunohistochemical analyses showed ring-like stainings along the periphery of the nucleus in sham control brains. After tMCAO, Gp210 and Nup107 immunoreactivity continuously increased from 1 day, and RanGap1, Nup205, and Nup50 increased from 2 days until 28 days, which also displayed progressive precipitations within the nucleus in the peri-ischemic area, while the ischemic core showed scarce expression with collapsed structure. Double immunofluorescent analyses revealed nuclear retention and apparent colocalization of RanGap1 with Nup205, Gp210 with Nup205, and partial colocalization of Nup205 with Nup107; most of the ischemic changes above were similar to those observed in patients with C9orf72-genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Taken together, these observations suggest that the mislocalization of these nucleoporins may be a common pathogenesis of both ischemic and neurodegenerative disease. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment in rivaroxaban compared with warfarin-pretreated male Wistar rat brain after ischemia in relation to activation profiles of protease-activated receptor-1, -2, -3, and -4 (PAR-1, -2, -3, and -4). After pretreatment with warfarin (0.2\u2009mg/kg/day), low-dose rivaroxaban (60\u2009mg/kg/day), high-dose rivaroxaban (120\u2009mg/kg/day), or vehicle for 14 days, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced for 90\u2009min, followed by reperfusion with tPA (10\u2009mg/kg/10\u2009ml). Infarct volume, hemorrhagic volume, immunoglobulin G leakage, and blood parameters were examined. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, immunohistochemistry for PARs was performed in brain sections. ICH volume was increased in the warfarin-pretreated group compared with the rivaroxaban-treated group. PAR-1, -2, -3, and -4 were widely expressed in the normal brain, and their levels were increased in the ischemic brain, especially in the peri-ischemic lesion. Warfarin pretreatment enhanced the expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 in the peri-ischemic lesion, whereas rivaroxaban pretreatment did not. The present study shows a lower risk of brain hemorrhage in rivaroxaban-pretreated compared with warfarin-pretreated rats following tPA administration to the ischemic brain. It is suggested that the relative downregulation of PAR-1 and PAR-2 by rivaroxaban compared with warfarin pretreatment might be partly involved in the mechanism of reduced hemorrhagic complications in patients receiving rivaroxaban in clinical trials. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a pivotal role in cellular defense against oxidative stress damage after ischemic stroke. In the present study, we examined the time-dependent change of in vivo optical imaging of oxidative stress after stroke with Keap1-dependent oxidative stress detector (OKD) mice. OKD mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 45\u2009min, and in vivo optical signals were detected during the pre-operative period, 12\u2009h, 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d after tMCAO. Ex vivo imaging was performed immediately after obtaining in vivo optical signals at 1 d after tMCAO. Immunohistochemical analyses and infarct volume were also examined after in vivo imaging at each period. The in vivo signals showed a peak at 1 d after tMCAO that was slightly correlated to infarct volume. The strong ex vivo signals, which were detected in the peri-ischemic area, corresponded to endogenous Nrf2 expression. Moreover, endogenous Nrf2 expression was detected mainly in neurons followed by oligodendrocytes and pericytes, but only slightly in astrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells. The present study successfully demonstrated the temporal change of in vivo imaging of oxidative stress after tMCAO, which is consistent with strong expression of endogenous Nrf2 in the peri-ischemic area with a similar time course. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial dynamically undergo massive fusion and fission events to continuously maintain their function in cells. Although an impaired balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion was reported in in-vitro and in-vivo Alzheimer's disease (AD) model, changes of mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins have not been reported in AD with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (HP) as an etiological factor related to the development of elder AD. To clarify the impacts of HP on mitochondrial fission and fusion, related oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD, and protective effect of galantamine, the novel AD with HP mouse model (APP23 + HP) was applied in this project. Compared with APP23 mice, APP23 + HP mice greatly enhanced the number of A\u03b2 oligomer-positive/phosphorylated tau (pTau) cells, the expression of mitochondrial fission proteins (Drp1 and Fis1), and decreased the expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins (Opa1 and Mfn1) in the cerebral cortex (CTX) and thalamus (TH) at 12 month (M) of age. Moreover, the expression of peroxidation products (4-HNE and 8-OHdG) showed a significant increase in CTX and TH of APP23 + HP mice at 12 M. However, above neuropathological characteristics were retrieved by galantamine (Gal) treatment, detected through immunohistochemical analyses. The present study demonstrates that cerebral HP shifted the balance in mitochondrial morphology from fusion to fission with increasing A\u03b2 oligomer/pTau accumulations in APP23 mice, and such neuropathologic processes were strongly attenuated by Gal treatment.",

We investigated immunohistological changes of neuroinflammation with nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-protein 3 (NLRP3), activated caspase-1 and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) in a novel AD (APP23) mice with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) model from 4 months (M) of age, moreover, examined protective effect of galantamine. CCH strongly enhanced NLRP3, activated caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 expressions in hippocampus and thalamus at age 12\u202fM of AD mice. CCH also exaggerated amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) 40 depositions in cerebral cortex. Furthermore, CCH exacerbated a marked dissociation of neurovascular unit (NVU). These pathological changes were ameliorated by galantamine treatment. The present study demonstrated that CCH strongly enhanced primary AD pathology including neuroinflammation, A\u03b2 accumulations and NVU dissociation in AD mice, which was greatly protected by an allosterically potentiating ligand galantamine.",

However, the profile and exact roles of ER stress-related molecules after Sig-1R agonist treatment in an in vivo stroke model are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a novel Sig-1R agonist, aniline derivative compound (Comp-AD), on the ER stress response following ischemic stroke. Male C57BL/6J mice received transient middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90\u2009min, and were then treated with vehicle saline or Comp-AD at reperfusion. At 3\u2009hr, 1 day, and 7 days after reperfusion, immunohis- tochemistry was performed for Sig-1R and ER stress-related proteins including phospho protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (p-PERK), phospho inositol requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (p- IRE1\u03b1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Neurobehavioral analysis showed improved functional recovery at 1 day and 7 days after reperfusion, and the infarct volume was significantly smaller at 7 days (p\u2009<\u2009.05), in the Comp-AD group compared with the vehicle group. Comp-AD treatment upregulated Sig-1R immunoreactivity at 3\u2009hr and 1 day (p\u2009<\u2009.05), and reduced p-PERK and p-IRE1\u03b1 expression at 1 day (p\u2009<\u2009.05, respectively), in the peri-ischemic region compared with the vehicle group. Treatment with the novel Sig-1R agonist Comp-AD was neuroprotective after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, and was associated with upregulation of Sig-1R and a reduction of ER stress.",

Here, the present study was designed to assess the efficacies of SMTP-44D, moreover, compared with the standard neuroprotective reagent edaravone in ischemic brains. ICR mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 60\u00a0min, SMTP-44D (10\u00a0mg/kg) or edaravone (3\u00a0mg/kg) was intravenously administrated through subclavian vein just after the reperfusion, and these mice were examined at 1, 3, and 7 d after reperfusion. Compared with the vehicle group, SMTP-44D treatment revealed obvious ameliorations in clinical scores and infarct volume, meanwhile, markedly suppressed the accumulations of 4-HNE, 8-OHdG, nitrotyrosine, RAGE, TNF-\u03b1, Iba-1, and cleaved caspase-3 after tMCAO. In addition, SMTP-44D significantly prevented the dissociation of NVU and improved the intensity of NAGO/BDNF and the number of BDNF/TrkB and BDNF/NeuN double positive cells. These effects of SMTP-44D in reducing oxidative and inflammatory stresses were similar to or stronger than those of edaravone. The present study demonstrated that SMTP-44D showed strong anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, moreover, the drug also significantly improved the NVU damage and NVTC in the ischemic brain.",

        "abstract": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy are two major pathways to degrade misfolded proteins that accumulate under pathological conditions. When UPS is overloaded, the degeneration pathway may switch to autophagy to remove excessive misfolded proteins. However, it is still unclear whether and how this switch occurs during cerebral ischemia. In the present study, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) resulted in accelerated ubiquitin-positive protein aggregation from 0.5\u2009h of reperfusion in mice brain after 10, 30 or 60\u2009min of tMCAO. In contrast, significant reduction of p62 and induction of LC3-II were observed, peaking at 24\u2009h of reperfusion after 30 and 60\u2009min tMCAO. Western blot analyses showed an increase of BAG3 and HDAC6 at 1 or 24\u2009h of reperfusion that was dependent on the ischemic period. In contract, BAG1 decreased at 24\u2009h of reperfusion after 10, 30 or 60\u2009min of tMCAO after double immunofluorescent colocalization of ubiquitin, HSP70, p62 and BAG3. These data suggest that a switch from UPS to autophagy occurred between 10 and 30\u2009min of cerebral ischemia depending on the BAG1/BAG3 ratio and level of HDAC6.",

The reactive hyperemia index (RHI) of peripheral arterial tonometry and serological data were compared between age- and gender-matched normal controls (n=302) and five disease groups (ALS; n=75, PD; n=180, PSP; n=30, MSA; n=35, SCA; n=53). Correlation analyses were performed in ALS with functional rating scale-revised (FRS-R), and in PD with the Hehn-Yahr scale (H-Y) and a heart to mediastinum ratio using (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy (MIBG). The RHI of ALS and PD, but not of PSP, MSA or SCA, were significantly lower than normal controls (p<0.01). ALS showed a negative correlation of RHI with serum triglycerides (TG) and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels, but not with disease severity (FRS-R) or rates of disease progression (\u2206FRS-R). On the other hand, PD showed a negative correlation of RHI with a progressive disease severity (H-Y) and a positive correlation of RHI with early/delayed MIBG scintigraphy, but not with serological data. The present study demonstrated significant declines of peripheral arterial endothelial functions in ALS and PD. The RHI of ALS was more correlated with disease duration and serum parameters while the RHI of PD was more correlated with disease severity and MIBG, suggesting different mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction.

A free radical scavenger edaravone has been proven as a therapeutic drug for ALS patients, but the neuroprotective mechanism for the oxidative stress of ALS has not been fully investigated. In this study, we investigated oxidative stress in ALS model mice bearing both oxidative stress sensor nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and G93A-human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Nrf2/G93A) treated by edaravone. In vivo Nrf2 imaging analysis showed the accelerated oxidative stress both in spinal motor neurons and lower limb muscles of Nrf2/G93A mice according to disease progression in addition to the enhancement of serum oxidative stress marker dROMS. These were significantly alleviated by edaravone treatment accompanied by clinical improvements (rotarod test). The present study suggests that in vivo optical imaging of Nrf2 is useful for detecting oxidative stress in ALS, and edaravone alleviates the degeneration of both motor neurons and muscles related to oxidative stress in ALS patients.",

Fifty-seven ALS, 5 ALS with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (ALS-FTD), 12 FTD patients, and 35 control subjects were evaluated by 10 different tests for cognitive and behavioral (mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Hasegawa dementia rating scale - revised (HDS-R), frontal assessment battery (FAB), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), ALS-frontotemporal dementia-Questionnaire (ALS-FTD-Q), and anosognosia scale), affective (depression, apathy, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)), and activities of daily living (ADL) assessments. The motor functions of ALS patients were evaluated by ALS functional rating scale - revised (ALSFRS-R) and modified Norris scale. ALS-FTD-Q scores showed intermediate behavioral disturbances of ALS patients between ALS-FTD and FTD patients and control subjects, but FAB, MoCA, and anosognosia scales did not. Both FAB and MoCA scores were significantly correlated with MMSE and HDS-R in ALS patients, but ALS-FTD-Q was not. ALS-FTD-Q score was significantly correlated with ALSFRS-R, apathy, BPSD, and ADL scores in ALS patients. Thus, in ALS patients, both FAB and MoCA tests were useful to assess frontal cognitive impairments, while ALS-FTD-Q was useful to detect mild behavioral and affective disturbances.",

In ALS, both glucose consumption and neuronal intensity reportedly decrease in the cerebral motor cortex when measured by positron emission tomography (PET). In this study, we evaluated cervical spinal glucose metabolism, blood flow, and neuronal intensity of 10 ALS patients with upper extremity (U/E) atrophy both with F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-FDG) PET and C-flumazenil (C-FMZ) PET. On the ipsilateral side of C5 and T1 levels, F-FDG uptake increased significantly (*p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and was correlated with the rate of progression of the ALS FRS-R-U/E score (R\u00a0=\u00a00.645, *p\u00a0=\u00a00.041). Despite this hyperglucose metabolism, the C-FMZ PET study did not show a coupled increase of spinal blood flow even though neuronal intensity did not decrease. These results indicate a strong correlation between hyperglucose metabolism and ALS progression alongside the uncoupling of flow-metabolism. This mechanism, which could result in subsequent motor neuronal death, may be a potential therapeutic target for ALS.",

Here, we report 3 siblings of the ataxic form with cerebellar ataxia, mild mental retardation, and 3 additional characteristic features: mydriasis, hyperreflexia and involuntary head movement. All 3 siblings are compound heterozygous for a previously reported mutation, c.2T>C (p.M1T), and a novel mutation, c.920G>A, causing a missense change (p.C307Y) located in the RING finger domain of PEX10. The present cases suggest that these PEX10 mutations involve not only cerebellar but also more multiple nervous systems including pupillary autonomic, pyramidal and extrapyramidal systems.",

In 2012, Kobayashi et al. reported the first case of a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient carrying a G37V superoxide dismutase 1 mutation, who showed rapid progression and died within 1.2 years of onset from respiratory failure. In contrast, here we report the second case of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis carrying the G37V superoxide dismutase 1 mutation, showing a very slow progression, and his father and aunt also had longer disease durations from 4 to 6 years. Further clinical and biological studies will clarify the detailed pathological role of the G37V superoxide dismutase 1 mutation for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

Seven different neuronal antibodies (Ab) were detected for Hu, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), acetylcholine receptor, P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium-channels, Zic4, Titin, and SOX1 in her serum with intrathecal synthesis of GAD-Ab. Although she showed classical manifestations with onconeural antibodies, she was diagnosed with not paraneoplastic but autoimmune neurological syndrome because of no underlying tumor and good response to immunotherapies. Our present case is very unique and rare for complexed neurological disorders including MG and LEMS overlap syndrome with multiple neuronal antibodies.This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Progressive myelopathy is caused by infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, paraneoplastic, demyelinating, vascular, hereditary, degenerative, metabolic, and toxic properties1, 4. Here we report a case of a 53-year-old woman who showed a progressive cervical and thoracic myelopathy with muscle weakness in all limbs and hypoesthesia in all limbs and trunk below the Th8 level without any evident magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions. She displayed rheumatoid factor, anti-double standard DNA antibody, and hepatitis B surface antigen, as well as an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level. Paraneoplastic antibodies which we examined were negative. Our treatments (plasma exchange, steroid pulse therapy, and immunoglobulin therapy) were slightly effective, but the symptoms did not improve completely. The present case suggests that the presence of a cervical and thoracic lesion without evident MRI abnormalities needs a careful follow up to discover occult lesions.This article is protected by copyright.

The present PSP patient had slightly impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), but the condition became considerably worse with normal nutrients due to limited activity and an infection after PEG, resulting in a non-ketoic hyperosmolar coma (NKHC). After receiving supplementary fluid, intravenous insulin, antibiotics and endotracheal intubation, the patient recovered from the NKHC state. PEG placement at an advanced stage of a neurodegenerative disorder such as PSP should have a careful follow-up, especially when glucose tolerance worsens.This article is protected by copyright.

Intracranial rupture of the pituitary abscess is usually fatal. Here, we report a 76-years-old woman with a pituitary abscess who showed headaches, left eyelid ptosis, periorbital swelling, and external eye movement disturbances in the left eye. Although her symptoms initially improved after therapy with systemic antibiotics, the pituitary abscess suddenly developed an intraventricular rupture on admission day 27. However, emergency ventricular drainage in combination with different antibiotics gradually improved her condition. The present case suggests that the combination of emergency ventricular drainage and systemic antibiotic administration could serve as an alternative choice to manage pituitary abscesses of ventricular ruptures, especially in elderly patients.This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we report a rare case of a patient who developed successive VP shunt malfunction causing spastic muscle weakness in extremities associated cervical epidural venous distension and compressive myelopathy due to over-drainage of CSF through a defective VP shunt valve a decade after the initial shunt was placed. One should be aware and cognizant of this complication and carefully follow the symptoms and potentially utilize brain MRI with and without contrast to look at over drainage stigmata to avoid the development of neurological complications.",

        "abstract": "The clinical benefits of memantine, depending on the baseline cognitive and affective conditions in real world dementia clinics, have not been completely examined. We performed the Okayama Memantine Study II (OMS II) to retrospectively evaluate the clinical effects of memantine monotherapy (n = 38) in Alzheimeru0027s disease (AD) patients using seven batteries to assess dementia at the baseline, at 3, 6, and 12 months. Additionally, we divided 163 AD patients treated with memantine into two subgroups depending on the baseline cognitive score of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): the MMSE u003c15 group (n = 36) and the baseline MMSE \u226515 group (n = 127). We also analyzed 71 AD patients based on the baseline behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) severity using Abeu0027s BPSD score (ABS). Memantine monotherapy maintained cognitive functions until 6 months of treatment, but showed a decrease at 12 months (\u00a0*p u003c 0.05 versus baseline). However, memantine monotherapy greatly improved BPSD symptoms until 12 months (\u00a0*p u003c 0.05, \u00a0**p u003c 0.01) and maintained other affective functions as well as the activity of daily living. Memantine treatment showed similar effects, regardless of the baseline cognitive functions, but showed better effects on ABS for higher baseline cognitive functions. Memantine treatment greatly improved ABS depending on baseline BPSD severity. Our present OMS II showed that memantine monotherapy improved BPSD until 12 months. The higher baseline cognitive subgroup (MMSE \u226515) and the worse baseline BPSD subgroup were expected to show better effects with memantine.",

Furthermore, 34 FTD and all 121 AD patients were evaluated with a frontotemporal dementia-Alzheimeru0027s disease index (FA index), which we developed for novel diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging.Frontal assessment battery, geriatric depression scale, and Abeu0027s behavioral and psychological symptom of dementia score were significantly worse in FTD patients than in AD patients (\u00a0**p\u200au003c \u200a0.01 in FAB, \u00a0**p\u200au003c \u200a0.01 in the geriatric depression scale, and \u00a0***p\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdu003c \u200a0.001 in Abeu0027s behavioral and psychological symptom of dementia score), although there was no significant difference in the other five scores. The finding mistakes game score of the touch panel test was worse in FTD than in AD (\u00a0*p\u200au003c \u200a0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve of the FA index showed 91.4% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity with the FA index \u22640.6015 to discriminate FTD from AD.Combining clinical scores, a computerized touch panel test, and the FA index will help to provide a more accurate diagnosis of FTD in contrast to AD.",

Since both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can retain high replication competence and pluripotency when they differentiate into various kinds of cells, they are regarded as a promising cell source for cell replacement therapy. Recent progress includes the combination of novel transcriptional factors that can convert somatic cells to various kinds of mature neuronal cells and neural stem cells without requiring embryonic stem fate. In this paper, we would like to discuss the advantage, issues, and possibility of clinical application of these cells for cell replacement therapy for post-stroke patient.",

        "abstract": "i) Background u0026 Objectives:  Pericytes play a pivotal role in contraction, mediating inflammation, and regulation of blood flow in the brain. In the present study, changes of pericytes in the neurovascular unit (NVU) were examined in relation to the effects of exogenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and a free radical scavenger, edaravone.   ii) Methods:  Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses showed that the overlap between PDGFR\u03b2-positive pericytes and N-acetylglucosamine oligomers (NAGO)-positive endothelial cells increased significantly at 4 days after 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO).   iii) Results:  The number of pericytes and the overlap with NAGO decreased with tPA, but recovered with edaravone 4 days after tMCAO with proliferation. Thus, tPA treatment damaged pericytes resulting in the detachment from astrocytes and a decrease in GDNF secretion. However, treatment with edaravone greatly improved tPA-induced damage to pericytes.   iv) Conclusion:  The present study demonstrates that exogenous tPA strongly damages pericytes and destroys the integrity of the NVU, but edaravone treatment can extremely ameliorate such damage after acute cerebral ischemia in rats.",

        "abstract": "Telmisartan is a highly lipid soluble angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) which improves insulin sensitivity and reduces triglyceride levels, thus is called metabo-sartan. We examined effects of telmisartan on neurovascular unit (NAGO, collagen IV, and GFAP) and neuroinflammation (MMP-9 and inflammasome) in brain of stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR-SR). At 12 weeks of age, SHR-SR received transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 90 min, and were divided into the following 3 groups, i.e., vehicle group, low-dose telmisartan group (0.3 mg/kg/day), and high-dose telmisartan group (3 mg/kg/day,  p.o. ). Immunohistological analysis at ages 6, 12 and 18 months showed progressive decreases of NAGO-positive endothelium and collagen IV positive basement membrane, and progressive increases of MMP-9-positive neurons, GFAP-positive astrocytes, and NLRP3-positive inflammasome in the cerebral cortex of vehicle group. Low dose telmisartan reduced such changes without lowering blood pressure (BP), and high dose telmisartan further improved such changes with lowering BP. The present findings suggest that a persistent hypertension caused a long lasting inflammation after tMCAO in SHR-SR which accelerated neurovascular disruption and emergent inflammasome, and that telmisartan greatly reduced such inflammation and protected the neurovascular unit via its pleiotropic effects in living hypertensive rat brain after ischemic stroke.",

This case showed spasticity and hyperreflexia with pathological reflexes and ankle clonus as well as muscle weakness in all extremities. A motor nerve conduction study and the magnetic motor evoked potential suggested motor axonal neuropathy and corticospinal tract disorders.

They showed the typical phenotype of FSHD2 such as asymmetric muscle weakness and atrophy in bilateral facial, scapular and humeral muscles, but different clinicopathological features between them. The brother and asymptomatic mother showed normal D4Z4 methylation plus the same SMCHD1 mutation, but the sister showed the SMCHD1 mutation plus D4Z4 hypomethylation, suggesting an interesting correlation of the new SMCHD1 nonsense mutation and D4Z4 hypomethylation.",

Methods Up to 16 SMON patients (4 men, 12 women) and 32 control subjects were evaluated by the geriatric depression scale (GDS), apathy scale (AS) and state and trait anxiety inventory (STAI) forms X-I, including the P and A values for depression, apathy and state anxiety including disturbed peace of mind and enhanced anxiety, respectively, before (pre) and three months after (post) the telephone call service. Results The SMON patients, especially women, had significantly worse baseline scores in GDS (depression), AS (apathy) and STAI (state anxiety) than control subjects. The automated telephone call service significantly improved the high baseline STAI scores, including the P and A scores (disturbed peace of mind and enhanced anxiety), of SMON patients but not the GDS or AS scores. Conclusion SMON patients, especially women, living alone or with a single caregiver showed higher baseline depression, apathy and anxiety scores than the control subjects. The present automated telephone call service proved to be a useful care tool for improving the anxiety of SMON patients with high STAI P and A scores.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the clinical application of regenerative medicine using stem cells has been heralded as a new approach to the treatment of cerebral infarction.1 In Japan, various clinical trials on cell-based products are being initiated in patients with the disease.2,3 However, the full-scale clinical use of such products remains a major challenge. Unsolved questions include how nonclinical studies should be conducted and what type of designs should be used in clinical trials. Similar questions have remained in the United States. Researchers in the academia, industry leaders, and regulatory representatives organized the Stem Cell Therapeutics as an Emerging Paradigm in Stroke (STEPS) program, which proposed basic approaches to quality assurance, nonclinical studies, and clinical trials in the development of cell-based products for the treatment of cerebral infarction.4\u20136In Japan, the government has published guidelines for ensuring the quality and safety of individual cell-based products that are used as raw materials. However, no specific guidelines have been established for cell-based products for the treatment of cerebral infarction. Although the STEPS has proposed helpful basic approaches to the development of such regenerative medicine products, guidelines are needed that are based on Japanese regulations, taking into consideration the clinical setting of cerebral infarction treatment in the country.7 Such guidelines would be useful to facilitate appropriate development of the products. For these reasons, we prepared the Guidelines on Development of Cell-based Products for the Treatment of Cerebral Infarction. The guidelines comprised consensus about quality assurance, nonclinical studies, cell delivery methods, and clinical trials on products that were discussed in relevant individual working groups, while considering disease-specific issues and the existing Japanese guidelines on ensuring quality and safety of cell-based products for individual cell types.The original guidelines in Japanese language were framed by Working Group for \u2026",

Methods: ADS is an investigator initiated, a prospective, multicenter (34 hospitals in Japan), randomized, and an aspirin-controlled study. Acute stroke patients with non-cardioembolic stroke within 48 hours of onset were studied. Only patients with preadmission mRS score 0-2 were included. Subjects were randomly allocated to the combination therapy with aspirin 81-200mg plus cilostazol 200mg (Dual group) and the single therapy with aspirin 81-200mg (Aspirin group) for 14 days. After the 14 days, all patients took the cilostazol 200mg for 3 months. Primary outcomes include 1) the neurological worsening within 14 day of onset; and 2) the rates of transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke recurrence, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) within 14 days of onset.

        "abstract": "Background The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet (aspirin plus cilostazol) dual therapy for patients with noncardioembolic stroke within 48\u00a0hours of symptom onset. Methods and Results The ADS (Acute Aspirin Plus Cilostazol Dual Therapy for Non-Cardiogenic Stroke Patients Within 48 Hours of Symptom Onset ) study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter (34 hospitals in Japan), randomized, open-label, and aspirin-controlled trial. Acute stroke patients with noncardioembolic stroke within 48\u00a0hours of onset were studied. The subjects were randomly allocated to combination therapy with aspirin 81 to 200\u00a0mg plus cilostazol 200\u00a0mg (dual group) and single therapy with aspirin 81 to 200\u00a0mg (aspirin group) for 14\u00a0days. After the 14\u00a0days, all patients took the cilostazol 200\u00a0mg for 3\u00a0months. A primary efficacy outcome was defined as any one of the following occurring (neurological deterioration, symptomatic stroke recurrence, or transient ischemic attack) within 14\u00a0days. A primary safety outcome included intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Between May 2011 and June 2017, 1201 patients (796 [66%] men; median age, 69 [61-77] years) randomized 1:1 to either the dual group or the aspirin group were analyzed. Initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 2 (1-4) in both groups (P=0.830). A primary efficacy outcome was observed in 11% in the dual group and 11% in the aspirin group (P=0.853). A primary safety outcome occurred in 2 (0.3%) in the dual group and in 1 (0.2%) in the aspirin group (P=0.624). Conclusions Dual antiplatelet therapy using cilostazol and aspirin was safe but did not reduce the rate of short-term neurological worsening.

It was found that the rocking curves for each Zn- and O-terminated surface differ considerably. The relaxed structure of each polar surface was obtained from first-principles calculations using density functional theory. The results reveal compression relaxation of the top bilayer. Experimental rocking curves of each polar surface have been successfully reproduced by dynamical calculation of RHEED based on their relaxed surface structures. It was demonstrated that the RHEED method can identify the polarity of ZnO(0001) surfaces.",

Both of carrier concentration and Hall mobility increased after the annealing in Aratmosphere containing Zn (Zn-annealing). The improved electrical properties indicate that the zinc vacancy (V Zn )concentration was decreased by the Zn-annealing. While the Zn-annealed sample was not affected by hydrogen plasmairradiation, carrier concentration and Hall mobility of the sample annealed in pure Ar atmosphere were increased byhydrogen plasma irradiation. The simultaneous increases in carrier concentration and Hall mobility indicate that V Zn ,which acts as a compensation acceptor, is  by hydrogen. The carrier concentration and Hall mobility afterhydrogen plasma irradiation decreased with increasing post-annealing temperature. It was found that V Zn   byhydrogen starts to dissociate at temperatures around 400\u00b0C. The activation energy for the dissociation of the V Zn passivated by hydrogen was estimated to be 2.2 eV.",

A constant current was applied between a ZnO film and a Pt electrode in an electrolyte solution. The sheet resistance of the ZnO film increased and decreased depending on the direction of current flow during the electrochemical treatment. When the ZnO film was used as a cathode (forward biased condition), the sheet resistance of the ZnO film decreased with increasing treatment time. The optical bandgap of the H2-annealed ZnO film also depended on the direction of current flow and increased under the forward biased condition.

Therefore, individualization of HRTFs is important for highly accurate sound localization systems such as virtual auditory displays. In the present study, we assume that the interaural time deffierence (ITD) and the interaural level difference (ILD) can be estimated from the listener\u2019s anthropometric parameters. The individualization of the HRTFs is achieved by replacing the ITDs and ILDs of the non-individualized HRTFs with the listener\u2019s ones. In this report, the effect of the individualization was evaluated by listening experiment. The non-individual HRTFs were obtained by interpolating magnitude response of the listener\u2019s own HRTF and the flat ones. The ratios of the interpolation corresponded to the degrees of individuality. Then, the ITDs and ILDs were added to individualize HRTFs. From the results, the effect of the degree of individuality was i...",

In order to develop an estimation system of the direction of sound image corresponding to the multiple sound sources, it is necessary to know the behavior of the precedence effect in comprehensive sound source arrangement. So, we investigated the influence of the sound source arrangement on the precedence effect experimentally. The minimum angle between the directions of two sound sources is 30 degrees. Experimental method is a three Alternative Forced Choice Task. The three choices are in the direction of two sound sources and its intermediate. In the case of a bilaterally symmetrical arrangement of sound sources, our experimental results were in good agreement with the findings obtained in previous studies. However, our experimental results show that deviation of the localized direction of sound image is dependent on the sound image arrangement. Particularly, in the case of l...",

Short-term Fourier transforms (STFT) of the signals on the left and right channels are first calculated. The coefficients of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) are used to calculate the ratio of the spectral amplitudes of the left and right channels, which is termed the channel level difference (CLD). The DFT coefficients are then divided into multiple groups on the basis of the CLD, with each group representing a separated sound source. The signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR)is used to evaluate the signal separation performance. It was found that a rough estimate of the CLD threshold yielding the best SDR could be obtained by cross-correlating the separated sounds. For playback on a headset, each separated signal is convoluted with head-related transfer functions (HRTF) that represent the direction of that particular sound source. Subjective listening...",

Although the automated extraction has a core role as a pre-processing method in the diagnosis, all the existing systems for diagnosing the infection or gastric cancer using X-ray images have never contained the extraction into the systems due to difficulty of the extraction. In the proposed method, first, two objects of the barium-pool and the spinal column are extracted. Next, with the clue of these objects and difference of density distributions between the gastric area and its outer area, the essential region is extracted by detecting the contour of gastric area. Experimental results for the proposed method using 106 images have shown that the proposed method correctly extracted the essential region from 87 images.",

        "abstract": "Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1*01:01 has been shown to be involved in nevirapine-induced hepatic hypersensitivity reactions. In the present study, in silico docking simulations and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to predict the interaction mode of nevirapine with the peptide binding groove of HLA-DRB1*01:01 and its possible effect on the position and orientation of the ligand peptide derived from hemagglutinin (HA). In silico analyses suggested that nevirapine interacts with HLA-DRB1*01:01 around the P4 pocket within the peptide binding groove and the HA peptide stably binds on top of nevirapine at the groove. The analyses also showed that binding of nevirapine at the groove will significantly change the inter-helical distances of the groove. An in vitro competitive assay showed that nevirapine (1000 \u03bcM) increases the binding of the HA peptide to HLA-DRB1*01:01 in an allele-specific manner. These results indicate that nevirapine might interact directly with the P4 pocket and modifies its structure, which could change the orientation of loaded peptides and the conformation of HLA-DRB1*01:01; these changes could be distinctively recognized by T-cell receptors. Through this molecular mechanism, nevirapine might stimulate the immune system, resulting in hepatic hypersensitivity reactions.",

        "abstract": "Caramel color is widely used in the food industry, and its many variations are generally considered to be safe. It has been known for a long time that THI (2-acetyl-4-(tetrahydroxybutyl)imidazole), a component of caramel color III, causes lymphopenia in animals through sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) lyase (S1PL) inhibition. However, this mechanism of action has not been fully validated because THI does not inhibit S1PL in\u00a0vitro. To reconcile this situation, we examined molecular details of THI mechanism of action using \"smaller\" THI derivatives. We identified a bioactive derivative, A6770, which has the same lymphopenic effect as THI via S1PL inhibition. In the case of A6770 we observe this effect both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, and demonstrate that A6770 is phosphorylated and inhibits S1PL in the same way as 4-deoxypyridoxine. In addition, A6770 was detected in rat plasma following oral administration of THI, suggesting that A6770 is a key metabolic intermediate of THI.",

In order to predict the possible interaction modes of ximelagatran with HLA-DR molecules, in silico docking simulations were performed. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also performed to predict the effect of ximelagatran on the binding mode of the ligand peptide to HLA-DRB1*07:01. A series of in silico simulations supported the inhibitory effect of ximelagatran on the binding of the ligand peptide to HLA-DRB1*07:01 in vitro. Furthermore, direct interactions of ximelagatran with HLA-DR molecules were evaluated in vitro, which supported the simulated interaction mode of ximelagatran with HLA-DRB1*07:01. These results indicated that ximelagatran directly interacts with the peptide binding groove of HLA-DRB1*07:01 and competes with the ligand peptide for the binding site, which could alter the immune response and lead to the idiosyncratic ximelagatran-induced hepatotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "To estimate the clinical impact of pharmacokinetic modulation via breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), in vivo approaches in nonclinical settings are desired in drug development. Clinical observation has identified curcumin as a promising candidate for in vivo selectiveBCRP inhibition, in addition to several well-known inhibitors, such as lapatinib and pantoprazole. This study aimed to confirm the inhibitory efficacy of curcumin on gastrointestinal BCRP function in cynomolgus monkeys and to perform comparisons with lapatinib and pantoprazole. Oral area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and bioavailability of well-known BCRP (sulfasalazine and rosuvastatin), P-glycoprotein (fexofenadine, aliskiren, and talinolol), and cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A (midazolam) substrates were investigated in the presence and absence of inhibitors. Oral exposures of sulfasalazine and rosuvastatin were markedly elevated by curcumin with minimal changes in systemic clearance, whereas pharmacokinetic alterations after fexofenadine, aliskiren, and talinolol oral exposure were limited. Curcumin increased oral midazolam exposure without affecting systemic clearance, presumably due to partial inhibition of intestinal CYP3A. Lapatinib increased the oral AUC for sulfasalazine to a greater extent than curcumin did, whereas pantoprazole had a smaller effect. However, lapatinib also exerted significant effects on fexofenadine, failed to selectively discriminate between BCRP and P-glycoprotein inhibition, and had an effect on oral midazolam exposure comparable with that of curcumin. Thus, pharmacokinetic evaluation in monkeys demonstrated that pretreatment with curcumin as an in vivo selective BCRP inhibitor was more appropriate than pretreatment with lapatinib and pantoprazole for the assessment of the impact of BCRP on gastrointestinal absorption in non-rodent models.",

In the real inspection for new trademark images, similarity for essential objects which show products or services is evaluated to the registry. Although a similarity retrieval system which evaluates similarity between the essential objects has been already reported with trademark images represented by vector graphics, the existing system does not work well in some cases. The proposed method is an improvement version of the existing system. To enhance performance of the system, in the proposed method, the extraction of feature vectors for an objectu0027s contour shape is improved and the method of centroid distance is introduced into the feature extraction besides. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method could evaluate similarity of each essential object in trademarks better than the existing system.",

        "abstract": "Paper-based diagnostic tests based on the lateral flow immunoassay concept promise low-cost, point-of-care detection of infectious diseases, but such assays suffer from poor limits of detection. One factor that contributes to poor analytical performance is a reliance on low contrast chromophoric optical labels such as gold nanoparticles. Previous attempts to improve the sensitivity of paper-based diagnostics include replacing chromophoric labels with enzymes, fluorophores, or phosphors at the expense of increased fluidic complexity or the need for device readers with costly optoelectronics. Several groups, including our own, have proposed mobile phones as suitable point-of-care readers due to their low cost, ease of use, and ubiquity. However, extant mobile phone fluorescence readers require costly optical filters and were typically validated with only one camera sensor module, which is inappropriate for potential point-of-care use. In response, we propose to couple low-cost ultraviolet light-emitting diodes with long Stokes-shift quantum dots to enable ratiometric mobile phone fluorescence measurements without optical filters. Ratiometric imaging with unmodified smartphone cameras improves the contrast and attenuates the impact of excitation intensity variability by 15x. Practical application was shown with a lateral flow immunoassay for influenza A with nucleoproteins spiked into simulated nasal matrix. Limits of detection of 1.5 and 2.6 fmol were attained on two mobile phones, which are comparable to a gel imager (1.9 fmol), 10x better than imaging gold nanoparticles on a scanner (18 fmol), and >2 orders of magnitude better than gold nanoparticle-labeled assays imaged with mobile phones. Use of the proposed filter-free mobile phone imaging scheme is a first step toward enabling a new generation of highly sensitive, point-of-care fluorescence assays.",

        "abstract": "A prototype of a self-contained, automated, disposable device for chemically amplified protein-based detection of influenza virus from nasal swab specimens was developed and evaluated in a clinical setting. The device required only simple specimen manipulation without any dedicated instrumentation or specialized training by the operator for interpretation. The device was based on a sandwich immunoassay for influenza virus nucleoprotein; it used an enzyme-labeled antibody and a chromogenic substrate to provide an amplified visible signal, in a two-dimensional paper network format. All reagents were stored within the device. Device performance was assessed at Seattle Children's Hospital; clinical staff collected nasal swab samples from 25 patients and then operated test devices on site to detect influenza A and B in those specimens. The total test time from device initiation to result was approximately 35 min. Device performance for influenza A detection was \u223c70% accurate using in-house qRT-PCR influenza A as a gold-standard comparison. The ratio of valid to total completed device runs yielded a success rate of 92%, and the negative predictive value for both the influenza A and B assay was 81%. The ability to diagnose respiratory infections rapidly and close to the patient was well received by hospital staff, inspiring further optimization of device function.",

Coronal MR images of nine radial-ulnar deviated positions (every 5 degree from 15 degrees radial deviation to 25 degrees ulnar deviation) were obtained in volunteers and patients. Cine-mode MRI was assembled and was output to MPEG video to observe.  \u2003Cine MRI demonstrated the ulnar side of the TFCC was elongated by average 15\u2009mm in 15 degrees of radial deviation and shortened by average 8\u2009mm in 25 degrees of ulnar deviation in all normal TFCC subjects. Distal portion of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) was compressed during radial-ulnar deviation in 10 healthy volunteers and in 3 patients, but proximal portion of the TFC was stable throughout the motion. In contrast, the wavy deformities on the disc in ulnar deviation were observed in three patients with horizontal tear inside the TFCC. In nonunion of the ulnar styloid process, the fragment was snapped in maximum ulnar deviated position or elongation of the space between the styloid fragment and ulna was seen.  \u2003This study indicated normal and abnormal changes in the shape of the TFCC during radial-ulnar deviation motion on cine MRI. The abnormal dynamic changes of the TFCC may be seen in ulnar deviated position in patients, which are related to positive ulnocarpal stress test with the wrist forced ulnar deviated.",

[Subjects] Fifteen healthy young males volunteered to participate in this study. The inclusion criterion was a straight leg raising range of motion of less than 70 degrees. [Methods] Subjects performed two protocols: 1) stretching (S group) of the medial hamstrings, and 2) tanscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (100 Hz) with stretching (TS group). The TS group included a 20-minute electrical stimulation period followed by 10 minutes of stretching. The S group performed 10 minutes of stretching. Muscle hardness, pressure pain threshold, and straight leg raising range of motion were analyzed to evaluate the effects. The data were collected before transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (T1), before stretching (T2), immediately after stretching (T3), and 10 minutes after stretching (T4). [Results] Combined transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and stretching had significantly beneficial effects on muscle hardness, pressure pain threshold, and straight leg raising range of motion at T2, T3, and T4 compared with T1. [Conclusion] These results support the belief that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation combined with stretching is effective in reducing pain and decreasing muscle hardness, thus increasing range of motion.

        "abstract": "The reciprocating needle dispensing technique is capable of patterning functional inks with a wide range of viscosities. As injections are performed by extruding an ink driven by the reciprocating needle motion, the mechanical specifications and the ink properties are expected to influence the amount of ink conveyed by the needle, thereby affecting the size of drops formed on a substrate. Needle dispensing tests were performed by using Newtonian silicone oils of different viscosities and a pseudoplastic conductive ink with various needle speeds and positions of the needle and the ink reservoir. Time-resolved analysis of the dispensing motions indicated that the formation of the dynamic meniscus around the needle was primarily described by the Landau\u2013Levich\u2013Derjaguin ink-coating theory. However, a slight modification that accounted for the initial gap between the needle and the glass capillary was needed to precisely describe the ink extrusion behaviors. The scaling analysis presented herein provides a perspective for the precise control of drop formation via optimal tuning of the ink injection. Regarding ink filament pinch-off, we discovered that the pseudoplastic liquid exhibited a faster pinch-off at higher needle retraction speed, which is attributed to a reduction of the apparent viscosity due to shear thinning. This behavior is preferable for needle dispensing with better stability.",

        "abstract": "For the fabrication of an organic thin film transistor (OTFT) array on a plastic film using printing techniques, fine patterns with widths less than 10 \u03bcm were required. We have already succeeded to fabricate the OTFT arrays on a film substrate using microcontact printing and reverse-offset printing of silver nanoparticle ink; a width of the source and drain electrodes of the OTFT fabricated reached 5 \u03bcm, and its channel distance was also 5 \u03bcm. In this report, we introduce and explain our newly developed printing techniques based on microcontact printing, to obtain fine, high precision, and thick patterns for the manufacturing of the practical printed and flexible electronic devices.",
