        "abstract": "Cultivated land protection is one of the key difficulties in land management, and analysis on factors of cultivated land variation in China has significant meanings for development. Based on hypothesis that other factors are constant, conceptual model was firstly constructed for land use with integration of land assets, land use policies and land resources, then factors for variations of cultivated land in 1998-2002 were analyzed using econometric method on both national and regional scale, especially for the asset-political factors. The results show that, on a national scale, enhancement of land use policies, decrease of multiples of land value increment, increase of cultivated land inputs are helpful for cultivated land protection; increase of fertilizer leads to the decline of cultivated land; ratio of gross agricultural output, yields of crop and size of cultivated land per rural household do not explain the variations of cultivated land significantly. On regional scale, intensification of land use policies, promotion of supplement level for rural residents losing cultivated land and improvement of cultivated land input are advantageous for cultivated land protection. Specifically, reducing ratio of gross agricultural output in East China, and decreasing areas of irrigated land in West China, could be beneficial for maintenance of cultivated land. This paper concluded that integration of land resources-land assets-land use policies could better explain the variation of cultivated land protection, and then could take priorities to improve cultivated land protection in China based on the research results.",

Firstly, we put forward a novel secondary construction to obtain 1-resilient functions. Next, we present the relationships between the properties of these constructed 1-resilient functions and that of the initial functions. Based on the construction and a class of bent functions on n variables, we can obtain a class of (n\u2009+\u20093)-variable 1-resilient non-separable cryptographic functions with a high algebraic immunity, whose nonlinearity is equal to the bent concatenation bound 2n\u2009+\u20092\u2009\u2212\u20092(n\u2009+\u20092)/2. Furthermore, we propose a set of 1-resilient non-separable functions on odd number of variables with an optimal algebraic degree, a high algebraic immunity, and a high nonlinearity.

To measure the correlation between two arbitrary Boolean functions, we propose two new criteria called the sum-of-squares indicator and the absolute indicator of the cross-correlation between two Boolean functions.

Based on the properties of the cross-correlation function, we deduce the rough lower and the rough upper bounds on the two indicators by hamming weights of two Boolean functions, and generalize some properties between the Walsh spectrum and the cross-correlation function. Furthermore, we give the tight upper and the tight lower bounds on the two indicators.

        "abstract": "Abnormal hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle cells play an important role in airway remodeling in chronic asthma. The authors' previous studies have indicated that protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) is involved in the proliferation of passively sensitized human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, the authors examined the possible role of the alpha isoform of PKC in the control of cyclin D1 expression, using HASMCs passively sensitized on human atopic asthmatic serum as a model system. Cultured HASMCs were passively sensitized with serum from atopic asthmatic patients. Cell proliferation was measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and an MTT assay. Cell cycle status was analyzed by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression profiles of cyclin D1 were measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. Furthermore, the authors assessed the role of cyclin D1 in PKC alpha-induced HASMC proliferation by transfection with a recombinant cyclin D1 antisense construct. The activation of PKC alpha with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, up-regulated cyclin D1 expression and increased the proliferation of passively sensitized HASMCs. This effect was significantly decreased by specific inhibition of PKC alpha with Go6976. In addition, the authors showed that transfection with antisense cyclin D1 abolished PMA-induced G1/S progression and HASMC proliferation. These results demonstrate that PKC alpha promotes the proliferation of HASMCs sensitized with atopic asthmatic serum via up-regulation of cyclin D1 expression.",

        "title": "Regulation of Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis by ERK Signaling Pathway in Airway Smooth Muscle Cells of Rats",
        "abstract": "The regulative role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway on proliferation and apoptosis in rats\u2032 airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) was investigated. Primary cultures of ASMCs were established and cells between passages 4 and 7 were used for experiments. ASMCs were treated with ERK activator epidermal growth factor (EGF) and inhibitor PD98059. The expressions of ERK mRNA and protein were detected by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining. Proliferation of ASMCs were detected by MTT colorimetric assay and 3Hthymidine incorporation. Apoptosis of ASMCs were detected by Hoechst staining and Annexin-V FITC PI double staining. The levels of ERK1/2, phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2(p-ERK1/2) and procaspase-3 protein were detected by Western blotting. The expressions of ERK mRNA and ERK protein were obviously observed in ASMCs. Compared with control, the absorbance (A_ 490 ) value and DNA synthesis index of PD-treated ASMCs were significantly decreased (P<0.05). The apoptotic index and the percentage of the early apoptotic cells were significantly increased (P<0.05). The expressions of ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 protein were significantly down-regulated. The expressions of procaspase-3 protein was significantly increased. Compared with control, the A_ 490 value and DNA synthesis index were significantly increased (P<0.05) in EGF-treated cells. Apoptotic index and the percentage of the early apoptotic cells were significantly decreased (P<0.05). The levels of ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 protein were significantly increased, and the levels of procaspase-3 protein were significantly decreased. There were no significant differences between control and P+E group(P>0.05). ERK signaling pathway may play an important role in regulating ASMCs proliferation and apoptosis and ERK regulating the apoptosis of ASMCs possibly relates to the expressions of procaspase-3 protein. The finding will help to understand the mechanisms of asthmatic ASMCs involved in abnormal proliferation.",

        "title": "Effect of FTY720 on glomerulosclerosis and expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in subtotally nephrectomized rats]",
        "abstract": "To study the effect of FTY720 on glomerulosclerosis and expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in subtotal nephrectomized rats.Twenty-four rats were divided into sham-operation group, glomerulosclerosis model group and FTY720 treated glomerulosclerosis group with 8 rats in each group. The rats in the latter two groups were subjected to subtotal nephrectomy. After operation, the FTY720 treated group was fed with FTY720 at a dose of 0.5 mg/(kg x d) for 12 weeks. Urine protein excretion was measured before operation and 2 w, 4 w, 8 w and 12 w after operation. Then the rats were sacrificed and the left kidney was subjected to pathological evaluation. The expression of collagen IV, fibronectin, and cyclin E, p21, p27 were determined by immunohistochemical methods.Compared with the control group, the model group showed higher daily urine protein (Up) excretion from 2 w, (8.07 +/- 1.61) mg/d and thereafter. At 12 w, Up increased to (28.60 +/- 12.21) mg/d in model group, significantly higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). After treatment with FTY720, Up began to decrease from 4 w after operation, (9.90 +/- 1.49) mg/d at that time and (11.35 +/- 2.09) mg/d at 12 w, both were significantly lower than those in model group (P < 0.01). The model group showed higher level of serum creatinine from 8 w, (61.08 +/- 4.28) micromol/L at that time, (130.20 +/- 23.90) micromol/L at 12 w, both were much higher than those in control group (P < 0.05). In FTY720 treated group, serum creatinine level was (80.19 +/- 7.11) micromol/L at 12 w, much lower than that in model group. The changes of BUN were similar to those of creatinine in each group. Renal pathology and immunohistological evaluation showed that FTY720 could significantly inhibit the expression of collagen-IV and fibronectin in glomeruli and attenuate the extent of glomerulosclerosis. Moreover, FTY720 could upregulate glomerular expression of p21 and downregulate glomerular expression of p27 and cyclin E. The expression levels of p21 and cyclin E were significantly lower in treatment group than in model group (P < 0.05), but still higher than those in control group (P < 0.05). p27 expression in glomeruli was stronger in treatment group than that in model group (P < 0.05), and lower than that in normal group but the difference was not significant.FTY720 can diminish urine protein excretion and prevent glomerulosclerosis in subtotally nephrectomized rats. This protective effect is presumed to be associated with its effect on expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, and inhibition of extracellular matrix accumulation in glomeruli.",

        "abstract": "Th2-derived cytokines, including interleukin-4 (IL-4), are considered to play an important role in the development of airway remodeling of asthma.Our previous study has demonstrated that a recombinant adeno-associated virus containing antisense against IL-4 gene (rAAV-asIL4) vector could significantly suppress the expression of IL-4 protein and airway inflammation in the rat models of allergic asthma. In this study, we applied the rAAV-asIL4 vector to allergic rats to investigate the effects of anti-IL4 therapy on airway remodeling in allergic asthma.rAAV-asIL4 was used to infect the ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and challenged rats by tail-vein injection. IL-4 protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The number of eosinophils in BALF was counted. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and TGF-beta2-positive cells in the peribronchial space were detected by immunohistochemical staining, and collagen deposition beneath the basement membrane was detected by Sirius red stain. The lung tissues were collected for histologic analysis of total bronchial wall area (W(At)) and airway smooth muscle area (W(Am)).rAAV-asIL4 significantly decreased IL-4 protein in BALF of OVA-sensitized and challenged rats. The number of eosinophils in BALF, the TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2-positive cells in the peribronchial space were also suppressed. Moreover, the rAAV-asIL4 treatment inhibited the area of Sirius red staining in airways and the increase in W(At) and W(Am).These results suggest that rAAV-asIL4 may attenuate the airway remodeling process relevant to the inhibition of airway inflammation. This study provides elementary evidence for the potential utility of rAAV-asIL4 as an approach to gene therapy for asthmatic airway remodeling.",

The apoptosis of ASMCs were detected by Situ end labeling and Annexin-V FITC PI double staining. The expressions of bcl-2 and bax were detected by immunocytochemical staining. The levels of caspase-3 protein were detected by Western blot. ASMC were treated with ERK activator epidermal growth factor (EGF) and inhibitor PD98059.Compared with control group, the apoptotic index and the percentage of the early apoptotic cells in ASMC from chronic asthmatic group were significantly decreased. After treatment with PD98059, the apoptotic index, the percentage of the early apoptotic cells, the expression of bax and the expression of caspase-3 protein in ASMC from chronic asthmatic group were significantly increased, and the expression of bcl-2 in ASMC from chronic asthmatic group were significantly decreased. Compared with those before treatment, apoptotic index and the percentage of the early apoptotic cells were significantly increased in EGF-treated cells. PD98059 could markedly inhibit the effect of EGF.Apoptotic activation is significantly decreased in ASMC from chronic asthmatic group while the endogenous proliferation activation is significantly increased. The regulation of cell apoptosis is possibly related to ERK signaling pathway. The bcl-2 family and caspase-3 may participate in the regulation mechanism of cell apoptosis by ERK signaling pathway in ASMC from chronic asthmatic group.",

Methods: Patients were divided into 3 groups: GD (39 cases), HT(32 cases), and healthy control group (20 cases). The ratio of CD3 + T lymphocytes, subpopulations of CD3 +CD4 + and CD3 +CD8 + T cells, CD3 -CD19 + B cells and CD3 - (CD16 +/CD56 +)NK cell in the preipheral blood were evaluated by technique of flow cytometry. Results: Compared with healthy control group, the percentage of CD3 -CD19 + B cells in patients with GD was increased by 26.23% (P< 0.05).The percentage of CD3 - (CD16 +/CD56 +) NK cells in patients with GD was decreased by 43.60% (P< 0.05). The percentage of CD3 + T cells in patients with HT was decreased by 20.22% (P< 0.01). There was significant correlation between the positive expression of thyroid autoantibody and the changes of B cells subpopulations (r= 0.42,P< 0.01). There were no significant differences among the proportions of CD3 +CD4 + and CD3 +CD8 + T lymphocytes in all 3 groups. Conclusions: Different pathological changes and clinical manifestations in patients with GD and HT may owe to its significant difference in the distribution of T, B and NK cells.",

Methods UUO was induced in SD rats by ligation of the left ureter.Forty-five male SD rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group,UUO group and FTY720 treatment group.The rats in FTY720 treatment group were gavaged with 0.5 mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1 of FTY720,which begun 3 days before operation.The rats in sham group and UUO group were gavaged with equal volume saline water of 9 g\u00b7L-1.Five rats in each group were sacrificed on the 7th,14th and 21st day after UUO or sham-operation.Before being sacrificed,24 h urine protein,blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were determined.Tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration were examined by morphological analysis,while the expressions of CD141,\u03b1-smooth muscle actin(\u03b1-SMA),and collagen\u2162 were detected by immunohistochemical me-thod and scored semi-quantitatively. Results Significant interstitial fibrosis,renal function deterioration and higher expressions of \u03b1-SMA,collagen\u2162 in the tubulointerstitial region were noted in UUO group with more markedly decreased PTC density,compared with sham-operated group.The PTC density were(116.80\u00b18.92) mm-2,(98.80\u00b13.96)mm-2,and(62.20\u00b17.01) mm-2 on the 7th,14th,and 21st day(Pa<0.05).Compared with UUO group,interstitial fibrosis and impaired renal function were ameliorated by the administration of FTY720 with less PTC loss.The PTC density were(132.50\u00b18.32) mm-2,(119.40\u00b112.21) mm-2,and(85.00\u00b12.59) mm-2 on the 7th,14th,and 21st day(Pa<0.05).It showed that PTC density was negatively correlated with the degree of renal fibrosis,the number of inflammatory cells,the level of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen,and 24 h urine protein(r=-0.75,-0.72,-0.64,-0.65,-0.67,Pa<0.01).

Methods Forty-five male SD rats were randomly divided into sham-operated (sham), UUO and UUO treated with FTY720 (UUO+FTY720) groups. UUO was induced in SD rats by ligation of the left ureter. 0.5 mg/(kg\u00b7d) of FTY720 or vehicle was administrated through daily gavage and begun from 3 days before the operation till being sacrificed. Five rats in each group were sacrificed at day 7, 14 and 21 after UUO or sham-surgery, and 24-h urine protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma creatinine were determined. The renal tubular interstitial fibrosis lesion and the expression of \u03b1-SMA, COL-\u2162, CD3, ED-1 were scored semi-quantitatively. Results The amount of 24-h urine protein in FTY720-treated group was lower than that in UUO group (P<0.05). Serum creatinine in FTY720-treated group at 7th, 14th, 21st day was significantly lower than that in UUO group. The BUN was significantly lower in FTY720-treated group than in UUO group (P<0.05). The renal pathological evaluation indicated that the scores of renal interstitial fibrosis were lower in FTY720-treated group than in UUO group. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the \u03b1-SMA expression was limited to vessels in sham group, but extended to renal tubule and interstitium in UUO and FTY720-treated groups, and the expression was weaker in FTY720-treated group than in UUO group. Some collagen \u2162 expression was found in sham group, and in UUO group, it was significantly enhanced at 7th, 14th, 21st day and mainly distributed in renal interstitium. The expression of collagen \u2162 in FTY720-treated group was also increased compared to sham group, but markedly lower than that in UUO group. Obvious lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration was found in tubular interstitial area in UUO group but significantly less in FTY720-treated group (P<0.01). Conclusion Novel immunomodulator FTY720 can obviously inhibit renal interstitial lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration, renal tubule cell transdifferentiation, extracellular matrix accumulation and interstitial fibrosis, thus prevent renal disease progression.",

        "abstract": "Objective FTY720 is a novel immune modulating drug which obtained through structural modification of ISP-1,an immunosuppressive substance newly purified from Cordyceps sinensis,a Chinese herb traditionally used in the treatment of renal diseases.In recent years,the role of FTY720 in the immune mediated glomerulonephritis has been demonstrated,but its effects on renal interstitial fibrosis,a major determinant for prognosis,remain uncertain.The present study is aimed to examine the role of FTY720 in the inhibition of renal interstitial fibrosis in rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction(UUO).Methods Forty-five male SD rats were randomly divided into sham-operated(SHAM),operated UUO and UUO treated with FTY720(UUO+FTY720)groups.Unilateral ureteral obstruction was induced in SD rats by ligation of the left ureter.0.5 mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1 of FTY720 or saline was administrated through daily gavage started three days before the operation until being sacrificed.Five rats in each group were sacrificed 7,14 and 21 days after UUO or Sham-surgery.In order to investigate if renal fibrosis closely correlates with renal insufficiency,24-hour urine protein,blood urea nitrogen(BUN)and serum creatinine were determined.The renal tubular interstitial fibrosis lesion and the expression of \u03b1-SMA and COL-\u2162 were detected by pathdogical examine and immunohistochemistry and scored.Results The amount of 24 hours urine protein was(9.7\u00b11.7)mg\u00b7d-1 at day 14 after operation in FTY720 treated group,much lower than that in UUO group,which was(15.5\u00b11.5)mg\u00b7d-1at the same time(P<0.05).Serum creatinine was(123.0\u00b115.8)\u03bcmol\u00b7L-1,(65.9\u00b16.1)\u03bcmol\u00b7L-1,(51.4\u00b16.9)\u03bcmol\u00b7L-1 in UUO group at days 7,14,21,respectively and(41.8\u00b14.5)\u03bcmol\u00b7L-1,(39.5\u00b17.9)\u03bcmol\u00b7L-1,(38.5\u00b14.5)\u03bcmol\u00b7L-1 in FTY720 treated group at days 7,14,21,respectively.The level of creatine in FTY720 treated group were significantly lower than that in UUO group.The Blood urea nitrogen was(16.1\u00b13.2)mmol\u00b7L-1,(10.7\u00b11.7)mmol\u00b7L-1 in UUO group and(8.1\u00b11.0)mmol\u00b7L-1,(7.0\u00b10.8)mmol\u00b7L-1 in FTY720 treated group at days 7,14 respectively.The levels of urea nitrogen was significantly lower in FTY720 group than that in UUO group(P<0.05).The renal pathological evaluation indicated that the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells in renal interstitial was fewer in FTY720 group than that in UUO group,and the score of renal interstitial fibrosis was lower in FTY720 group than that in UUO group.Immunohistochemistry study revealed that \u03b1-SMA expression was limited to vessels in SHAM group,but extended to renal tubules and interstitium in UUO and FTY720 treated group,while relatively weaker expression was observed in FTY720 group than in UUO group.Some collagen \u2162 expression was found in SHAM group,which was much enhanced in UUO group at days 7,14,21 and mainly distributed in renal interstitium,the expression in FTY720 group was also increased compared to SHAM group,but much lower than that in UUO group.Conclusions Novel immunomodulator FTY720 can obviously inhibit infiltration of inflammatory cell,transdifferentiation of renal tubule cell,extracellular matrix accumulation and interstitial fibrosis,thus prevent renal disease progression.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the regulatory effect of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway on airway smooth muscle cell (ASMC) proliferation in chronic asthmatic rats, the rat model of chronic asthma was established, and ERK agonist epidermal growth factor (EGF) and inhibitor PD98059 were used in the cell culture. ASMC proliferation was examined by flow cytometry analysis, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric assay, [(3)H]-thymidine (TdR) incorporation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunocytochemical staining. The expressions of ERK mRNA, ERK protein, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) protein were observed by RT-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that in chronic asthmatic group, compared with that in the control group, the percentage of cells at G(0)/G(1) phase was significantly decreased and the percentage of cells at S+G(2)/M phase was significantly increased. Absorbance (A(490)), DNA synthesis and the expression of PCNA protein in ASMCs in chronic asthmatic group were significantly increased. The expressions of ERK mRNA, ERK1/2 protein, p-ERK1/2 protein and the activation ratio of ERK in ASMCs in chronic asthmatic group were significantly increased compared with those in the control group. After treatment with PD98059, the percentage of cells at S+G(2)/M phase, A(490), DNA synthesis and the expression of PCNA protein in ASMCs in chronic asthmatic group were significantly decreased; the expressions of ERK mRNA, ERK1/2 protein, p-ERK1/2 protein and the activation ratio of ERK in ASMCs in chronic asthmatic group were significantly decreased compared with those in the control group. After treatment with EGF, the percentage of cells at S+G(2)/M phase, A(490), DNA synthesis and the expression of PCNA protein in ASMCs in chronic asthmatic group were significantly increased compared with those before treatment; and PD98059 markedly inhibited the effect of EGF. These results suggest that the endogenous proliferation activity of ASMCs in chronic asthmatic rats significantly increases compared with that in the control rats, and ERK1/2 participates in this process. The ERK signaling pathway might play an important role in regulating ASMC proliferation, leading to asthmatic airway remodeling.",

        "abstract": "This work was designed to explore the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway in migration of bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs) of chronic asthmatic rats. To make chronic asthma model, Wistar rats underwent ovabumin (OVA) injection and eight-week inhalation. BSMCs were cultured in vitro. The expression of ERK1/2 in BSMCs was analyzed by immunocytochemistry, Western blot and RT-PCR. Migration of BSMCs was detected by both plate test and Boyden cell test. Results showed: (1) With Western blot technique, the ratio of p-ERK1/2 to total ERK1/2 in chronic asthmatic group was obviously higher than that in the control group (0.55 +/- 0.05 vs 0.48 +/- 0.04, n=10, P<0.01). (2) With RT-PCR, the relative A values of ERK1 and ERK2 mRNA in airways of chronic asthmatic rats were 1.83 +/- 0.24 and 1.07 +/- 0.11, respectively, which were significantly increased compared with that in the control group (0.58 +/- 0.14 and 0.51 +/- 0.12, n=10, P<0.01). (3) In plate test, the migration of BSMCs of chronic asthmatic rats was 2.9 times of that in the control group and reached 5.0 times by epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, but decreased to 1.7 times by 30 mumol/L PD98059. (4) In Boyden cell test, the migration of BSMCs of chronic asthmatic rats was 1.9 times of that in the control group, and reached 3.1 times by EGF stimulation, but decreased to 1.45 times by 30 mumol/L PD98059. Our results indicate that the migration ability of BSMCs of chronic asthmatic rats increases, and ERK1/2 signaling pathway may play an important role in this process.",

        "abstract": "Airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell proliferation is a key feature of airway remodeling in asthma. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway is one of the most important transduction pathways involved in the proliferation of ASM of asthmatic rats. However, its role in the human ASMCs proliferation remains unclear.HASMCs were cultured in vitro and passively sensitized with 10% serum from asthmatic patients, and non-asthmatic human serum treated HASMCs served as the control. Then, HASMCs were transfected with ERK sense, antisense and mismatched oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). The proliferations of HASMCs were detected by flow cytometry analysis, MTT colorimetric assay, [\u00b3H] thymidine incorporation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in immunofluorescence staining respectively. The apoptosis of HASMCs were detected by in situ end labeling and Annexin-V FITC PI double staining. The expressions of ERK mRNA, ERK protein and phosphorylation of ERK1/2(p-ERK1/2) protein were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.The percentage of S + G\u2082/M phase, absorbance (A(490)) value, DNA synthesis value and the expression of PCNA protein in HASMCs passively sensitized with 10% serum from asthmatic patients were (22.48 \u00b1 2.04)%, (0.507 \u00b1 0.090), (3869 \u00b1 396) cpm/10\u2076 cells, (11.25 \u00b1 1.21), respectively. After treated with ERK oligodeoxynucleotides, these measurements were decreased to (14.21 \u00b1 1.21)%, (0.271 \u00b1 0.021), (2811 \u00b1 182) cpm/10\u2076 cells and (5.25 \u00b1 0.60), respectively (F = 65.594, 39.676, 61.111, 120.321, respectively, P < 0.05). The apoptotic index (13.96 \u00b1 1.72) and the percentage of the early apoptotic cells (9.17 \u00b1 0.47)% in HASMCs from group AODNs were significantly increased compared to those of chronic asthma group, which were (5.37 \u00b1 0.05), (3.26 \u00b1 0.04)%, respectively (F = 98.181, 65.444, respectively, P < 0.05). The expression of ERK mRNA (0.43 \u00b1 0.06) and the activation ratio of ERK (63 \u00b1 6)% in HASMCs from group AODNs were significantly decreased compared to those of chronic asthma group, which were (0.89 \u00b1 0.09), (87 \u00b1 8)%, respectively (F = 78.043, 87.288, respectively, P < 0.05). ERK antisense ODN inhibited the proliferation of HASMCs and induced the apoptosis of HASMCs, but the sense and the mismatched ones did not have these effects.ERK antisense ODN inhibited the proliferation and increased the apoptosis in cultured HASMCs passively sensitized with 10% serum from asthmatic patients. The result suggests that ERK signaling pathway may contribute to the proliferation and apoptosis of HASMCs in asthmatic patients.",

        "abstract": "Quercetin, an important dietary flavonoid has been demonstrated to potentially reverse or even prevent pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) progression. However, the effects of quercetin on apoptosis and autophagy in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) have not yet been clearly elucidated. The current study found that quercetin significantly induce the apoptotic and autophagic capacities of PASMCs in vitro and in vivo in hypoxia. In addition, we found that quercetin increases FOXO1 (a major mediator in autophagy regulation) expression and transcriptional activity. Moreover, FOXO1 knockdown by siRNAs inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR and 4E-BPI, which is downstream of P70-S6K, and markedly blocked quercetin-induced autophagy. We also observed that FOXO1-mediated autophagy was achieved via SESN3 not Rictor upregulation and after mTOR suppression. Furthermore, Treatment with autophagy-specific inhibitors could markedly enhance quercetin-induced apoptosis in PASMCs under hypoxia. Finally, quercetin in combination with autophagy inhibition treatment could enhance the therapeutic effects of quercetin in hypoxia-associated PAH in vivo. Taken together, quercetin could enhance hypoxia-induced autophagy through the FOXO1-SENS3-mTOR pathway in PASMCs. Combining quercetin and autophagy inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating hypoxia-associated PAH.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by excessive proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), leading to dysregulated vascular remodeling. Cigarette smoke (CS) is a common risk factor causing PH, and our previous study showed that CS extract (CSE) stimulated abnormal PASMC proliferation. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In systemic circulation, vascular remodeling in some diseases is associated with upregulation of Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), which stimulates the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. We therefore hypothesized that upregulation of KLF4 may play a role in pulmonary vascular remodeling and the development of PH. Our results showed that KLF4 expression was increased significantly in remodeled pulmonary arteries from the rat smoking model of pulmonary vascular remodeling, compared with controls. In human PASMCs in vitro, KLF4 knockdown by gene silencing decreased proliferation and migration significantly. At the same time, it inhibited the CSE-induced increase of AKT phosphorylation. These results indicate that KLF4 contributes to CS-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling, and that KLF4 gene knockdown may be a useful therapeutic intervention for PH.",

KLF5, a zinc-finger transcription factor, is involved in the excessive proliferation and apoptotic resistance phenotype associated with monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. However, the molecular mechanisms of KLF5-mediated pathogenesis of HPH are largely undefined. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (10% O2) for 4 wk. Hypoxic rats developed pulmonary arterial remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy with significantly increased right ventricular systolic pressure. The levels of KLF5 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) were upregulated in distal pulmonary arterial smooth muscle from hypoxic rats. The knockdown of KLF5 via short-hairpin RNA attenuated chronic hypoxia-induced hemodynamic and histological changes in rats.

YSZ ceramics were synthesized by the solid state reaction method. The phase, microstructure and thermal properties of YSZ ceramics were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and laser-flash apparatus (LFA), respectively. The results indicated that the specific heat capacity of YSZ increased with the increase of temperature and decreased with the increase of yttria content. As the temperature increased, the thermal diffusivity and conductivity of YSZ ceramics were decreased, whereas their variations for 16YSZ, 18YSZ and 20YSZ were much less pronounced than those for 12YSZ and 14YSZ. At a given temperature, the thermal conductivity of YSZ was opposite to yttria content. The thermal conductivity of YSZ ceramics almost linearly decreased with the increase of porosity. In addition, the grain size also had a great influence on the thermal conductivity. \u00a9 2011 The Chinese Society of Rare Earths.",

The results showed that a hardness of 12.93\u202fGPa, combined with an excellent high-fracture toughness of 9.17\u202fMPa\u202fm 1/2 , could be attained for HP-doped (0\u20130.25\u202fwt% (Al 2 O 3 )) ceramics, as well as an increase in hydrothermal stability with the increase in Al 2 O 3  content. The HP +\u202f0.15\u202fwt% (Al 2 O 3 ) ceramics exhibited better antiaging performance and mechanical properties. These 3Y-TZP ceramics, with high-fracture toughness and better aging-resistance, which were prepared by a high-energy ball milling method, could meet the different demands of practical dental ceramics.",

        "abstract": "Objective To observe the apoptotic effects of RNAi-mediated NF-\u03baB p65 gene on silencing pancreatic carcinoma cell strain PANC-1. Methods Chemically synthesized small interference RNA (siRNA) directed against human NF-\u03baB p65 was transfected into pancreatic carcinoma cell PANC-1 using cationic liposome LipofectamineTM 2000 as the transfecting agent. The expression of NF-\u03baB p65 gene was detected by RT-PCR technique. The DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB was detected by the chemicon non-radioactive NF-\u03baB p65 transcription factor assay kit. Nuclear DNA staining by Hoechst 33258, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscope was used to ascertain whether cell apoptosis could be induced by down-regulating the expression of p65 gene in PANC-1 cell. Results The results of RT-PCR indicated that chemically synthesized siRNA directed against human NF-\u03baB p65 could knock down the transcription and expression of NF-\u03baB p65 gene. The difference between the RelA siRNA group and control groups was significant (P<0.01). After transfection, the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB p65 in RelA siRNA group was much lower than that of the control groups (P<0.05). Nuclear DNA staining by Hoechst 33258, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy showed that knockdown of p65 expression by RNAi induced apoptosis in PANC-1 cell. Conclusion The study provides basis for researching the function of NF-\u03baB p65 gene, indicating down-regulating the expression of p65 gene by RNAi may induce apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma cell strain PANC-1.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To observe the proliferative and apoptotic effects of RNAi-mediated NF-\u03baB P65 gene on silencing pancreatic carcinoma cell strain PANC-1. Methods:Chemically synthesized small interference RNA(siRNA) directed against human NF-\u03baB P65 was transfected into pancreatic carcinoma cell strain PANC-1 by using cationic liposome LipofectamineTM2000. The expression of NF-\u03baB P65 and cyclinD1 gene was detected by using RT-PCR. The DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB was detected by the chemicon non-radioactive NF-\u03baB P65 transcription factor assay kit. The effect of cell proliferation was studied by MTT. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis and cell cycle of transfected cells. Results:The results of RT-PCR indicated that chemically synthesized siRNA could knock down the transcription and expression of NF-\u03baB P65 and cyclinD1 gene. The difference between the RelA siRNA group and control groups was significant(P < 0.01). After transfection,the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB P65 in RelA siRNA group was much lower than that in the negative control group and blank control group(P < 0.05). The inhibitory action on proliferation of RelA siRNA group cells was confirmed by MTT and cell cycle test. The apoptotic rate of RelA siRNA group was significantly higher than control groups(P < 0.01) and the cell account during G1 phases increased 10%. During S and G2/M phases the cells account decreased about 4% and 6%. Conclusion:The study provided basis for researching the function of NF-\u03baB P65 gene,indicating the expression of NF-\u03baB down-regulating might inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma cell strain PANC-1.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To observe the relationship between stability of erythrocyte membrane and expression of cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in experimental acute pancreatitis after total parenteral nutrition with fish oil supplementation. To evaluate the protective effect of fish oil supplementation on the early stage of inflammatory reaction in acute pancreatitis. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham operated group (n=18), fish oil supplementation treatment group (n=18), soybean oil treatment group (n=18) and normal sodium treatment group (n=18). Acute pancrea-titis was induced in the last three groups by retro-injected of 5% sodium cholate (1 mL/kg) into pancreatic ducts for almost 30 seconds. Fish oil supplementation (2 mL/kg), soybean oil (2 mL/kg) or normal sodium (2 mL/kg) was given intravenous to rats in fish oil supplementation treatment group, soybean oil treatment group or normal sodium treatment group respectively after modeling. Severity of pancreatitis was confirmed by level of serum amylase and histopathology score. Erythrocyte fragility test was performed to decide stability of erythrocyte membrane. Expression of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 was carried out by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results:Successful modeling was determined by level of hyperamylasemia (3 times than that of normal rats) and high histopathology score (>2). Compared with normal sodium, fish oil supplementation not soybean oil could significantly attenuate the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (P<0.05). This had a positive correlation with stability of erythrocyte membrane. Conclusion: By down-regulating the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, fish oil supplementation reduces the damage induced by inflammatory reaction at the beginning of acute pancreatitis. Fish oil supplementation can enhance the stability of erythrocyte membrane ,and it outstrips soybean oil during the early stage of acute pancreatitis.",

Patients were divided into two groups(96 cases and 25 cases) , respectively according to whether or not the portasystemic collateral shunts were reserved during operation. Results (1) Free portal pressure (FPP) decreased significantly after devascularization in both two groups [(47\u00b18) cmH2O vs. (37\u00b15) cmH2O, (41\u00b17) cmH2O vs. (37\u00b16) cmH2O; P<0.05], and in those with intact collateral vessels the decrease was more significant (P<0.01) ; (2)There was no marked difference in postoperative complications (10% vs.24%) and rebleeding incidence(8% vs. 0) between the two groups; (3) Cases with postoperative FPP over 37 cmH2O had higher postoperative complications(7% vs. 21%) and rebleeding incidence(0 vs.15%) than that below 37 cmH2O(P<0.05) . Conclusions Devascularization with portasystemic collateral vessels reserved can decrease FPP more effectively,and the postoperative FPP is the predictor of postoperative complications and rebleeding incidence.",

Medical data of these patients were reviewed retrospectively in terms of etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment. Results 21 patients had typical AP symptoms and signs and laboratory findings on admission. CA19-9 was within the normal range or elevated. The pancreas was found to be enlarged on CT and ERCP. Some patients were also associated with enlargement of the pancreatic and biliary ducts and cholecystolithiasis. All patients were diagnosed as having AP on admission. The 19 patients in other hospitals had lost the chance of surgical operation at the time of PC diagnosis. One of the patients in this hospital received radical surgery after correction of the diagnosis and survived well, while the other patient had lost the chance of surgical operation at the time of PC diagnosis.

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effect of NF-\u03baB subunit p65 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides(ASODN) on the proliferation of pancreatic carcinoma cells and the therapy effects of p65 ASODN on pancreatic carcinoma. Methods: p65 ASODN were designed and constructed and were transfected into human pancreatic carcinoma cell line PANC-1. The rate of transfection was detected by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. RT-PCR, MTT and clone assay were used to detect the expression level of p65 mRNA and proliferation of PANC-1 cells. Results: p65 ASODN was successfully transfected into PANC-1 cells. After the transfection, RT-PCR revealed that the expressions of p65 mRNA of antisense group, liposomes control group and blank control group were 0.24\u00b10.05, 0.37\u00b10.04 and 0.39\u00b10.03, respectively. The expression of p65 mRNA of the antisense group was significantly lower than those of the other groups, P=0.000. The results from the MTT assay indicated that 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours after the transfection, the cell proliferation of the antisense group was inhibited. The inhibition peaked at 48 hours after the transfection, P<0.01. The clone assay revealed that the cloning efficiencies of the antisense group, liposomes control group and blank control group were (14.9\u00b13.3)%, (23.3\u00b12.0)% and (25.8\u00b12.5)%. The cloning efficiency of the antisense group was reduced, P=0.000. Conclusions: The transfection of p65 ASODN could effectively down-regulate the expression of p65 mRNA and reduce cell proliferation of PANC-1 cells. The therapeutic prospect of p65 ASODN on pancreatic carcinoma is worthy of further investigation.",

The clinical data concerning preoperative and postoperative differences in free portal pressure, preservation rate of paraesophageal varices, postoperative early complications and the 5-year survival rates were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The preservation rates of para-esophageal varices were 33.3% in group 1, 88.2% in group 2 and 93.4% in group 3 and signifi- cant differences were detected among the three groups (P < 0.05). Significant differences were also detected between preoperative and postop- erative free portal pressure in each stage group (F = 5.22, P < 0.01). Differences in incidence rates of post-operative early complications were sig- nifi cant among stage 1 (33.3%), stage 2 (14.7%) and stage 3 (13.1%)(P < 0.05). 5-year survival rates increased from 74.1% in stage 1 group to 91.2% in stage 2 group, indicating a signifi cant difference(P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Selective devascularization low- ers free portal pressure more effectively, reduces incidence rates of postoperative early complica- tions and increases 5-year survival rates for pa- tients with portal hypertension.",

Methods: Rat model of SAP was produced by injecting 5% Sodium Cholate(1 ml/kg)into the biliopancreatic duct.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal group(n=6),fish oil emulsion treatment group(FOG,n=18),soybean oil emulsion treatment group(SOG,n=18) and normal sodium treatment group(NSG,n=18).Then fish oil emulsion(FO,10 ml/kg);soybean oil emulsion(SO,10 ml/kg)and normal sodium(NS,10 ml/kg)were intravenously injected respectively 120 minutes.The pancreatitis were confirmed by levels of serum AMS and histopathologic score.ALT,AST,BUN and Cr were tested 24 hours after the treatments.Expressions of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 were tested by ELISA.The activated NF-kappa B was examined in the pancreases. Results: Lower level of serum AMS(P<0.05)and lower histopathology score(P<0.05) appeared in FOG.Compared with NS,FO decreased the levels of serum ALT and BUN significantly(P<0.05).FO significantly attenuated the expression of IL-1\u03b2(P<0.05).FO downregulated the activity of NF-kappa B efficiently.Conclusions: By down-regulating the levels of IL-1\u03b2 together with up-regulating the level of IL-10,FO reduces inflammatory damage at the beginning of AP.",

Methods Retrospectively analyzed the 28 cases of pancreatic segmental portal hypertension in Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital from January 2003 to Febrary 2013. Results The underlying pancreatic diseases were pancreatic endocrine tumor (4 case),pancreatic cancer (8 case),pancreatic pseudocyst (10 case) and chronic pancreatitis (6 case) and 14 cases had the history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. None of the patients had cirrhosis,ascites or abnormal hepatic function. Endoscopy and endoscopic ul- trasound revealed that 20 patients had varices in the gastric fundus of which 6 patients had oesophageal varices simultaneously. All patients presented splenomegaly and hypersplenism. All patients underwent operation treatment. 28 patients with surgery were successfully. 8 cases of pancreatic body and tail cancer patients dead after 3 ~ 9month. 18 cases patients were followed up for 5 months to 8 years,periodic review of endoscopy,around the lower esophagus and gastric varices significantly improved or disappeared,no further bleeding. Conclusion Isolated gastric varices,splenomegalia and hypersplenism,normal liver function and pancreatic disease history can help to diagnose. Pancreatic segmental portal hypertension can be cured by splenectomy or extensive pericardial devascularization,and the management of primary pancreas disease shall also be emphasized.",

Factors to consider when choosing selective devascularization in the treatment of variceal hemorrhage remain a controversy. This study aims to generate the prevalent clinical risk factors that affect the outcomes of selective devascularization procedures. Elucidating these features may guide future treatment of esophageal varices in patients with portal hypertension. We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 455 patients who underwent selective devascularization procedures in our center. Patients were subject to splenectomy, selective devascularization with or without esophageal transection. The mode of surgery recurred in comparable rates in both the group with major complications postoperatively (high-risk group which consisted of 63 patients) or the group without major postoperative complications (low-risk group, 392). Risk factors that negatively influenced outcomes of surgery include severe symptoms (89% in high risk group and 71% in low risk group), large volume of blood loss in the hemorrhage before surgery (81% in high risk group and 16% in low risk group), sever liver cirrhosis (83% in high risk group and 67% in low risk group), previous endotherapy, prolonged prothrombin time, and poor liver function. Selective devascularization is a feasible option to treat variceal hemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Ellagic aicd (EA), a dietary polyphenolic compound found in plants and fruits, possesses various pharmacological activities. This study investigated the effect of EA on human pancreatic carcinoma PANC-1 cells both in vitro and in vivo; and defined the associated molecular mechanisms. In vitro, the cell growth and repairing ability were assessed by CCK-8 assay and wound healing assay. The cell migration and invasion activity was evaluated by Tanswell assay. In vivo, PANC-1 cell tumor-bearing mice were treated with different concentrations of EA. We found that EA significantly inhibited cell growth, cell repairing activity, and cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of PANC-1 xenografted mice with EA resulted in significant inhibition in tumor growth and prolong mice survival rate. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis showed that EA increased the percentage of cells in the G1 phase of cell cycle. Western blot analysis revealed that EA inhibited the expression of COX-2 and NF-\u03baB. In addition, EA reversed epithelial to mesenchymal transition by up-regulating E-cadherin and down-regulating Vimentin. In summary, the present study demonstrated that EA inhibited cell growth, cell repairing activity, cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. EA also effectively inhibit human pancreatic cancer growth in mice. The anti-tumor effect of EA might be related to cell cycle arrest, down-regulating the expression of COX-2 and NF-\u03baB, reversing epithelial to mesenchymal transition by up-regulating E-cadherin and down-regulating Vimentin. Our findings suggest that the use of EA would be beneficial for the management of pancreatic cancer.",

Considering the few degrees of freedom in this optimization, the reduced space sequential quadratic programming methods was applied to enhance the computation efficiency of the high dimensional nonlinear programming.

        "abstract": "As the existing power system peak load regulation scheme is designed based on the experience of dispatcher mainly, it has the disadvantages of strong subjectivity, inaccurate scheme evaluation system and so on. Coal consumption, power purchase cost and SO2 emission are used as power system peak load regulation scheme evaluation indexes. Combined the attribute recognition mode of ordered segmentation problems with the entropy value of information theory, the power system peak load regulation scheme evaluation system is proposed based on the entropy weight attribute recognition model. Firstly, the attribute space of the peak load regulation scheme is set up and partitioned in order. After using entropy theory to determine the evaluation index coefficient, the attribute measurement of peak load regulation scheme can be worked out with weight sum. Finally, by confidence criterion, the investigated scheme is evaluated. In the numerical examples, Guangdong power grid is used as application background, peak load regulation schemes of six typical days are evaluated to testify the proposed evaluation system.",

In this model the fault restoration process is divided into four stages, i. e., restoration in substation, restoration in distribution network, restoration in whole system and remote restoration. Thus, these agents at each layer produce the restoration scheme at each stage step by step based on the scheduled procedure. This scheme restores the lost loads as many as possible using the nearest power sources preferentially and hence reduces the influence of faults. The details on the behavior and function of all kind of agents, the coordination process among agents at each layer and design and implementation of this multi-agent system using JADE are elaborated.

Firstly, the research interval is divided into finite elements. Radau collocation method is used to convert the optimization model into a nonlinear programming by approximating all of the state variables, algebraic variables and control variables by a family of polynomials on each element. Then moving finite elements is introduced to adjust the length of each interval dynamically, achieve the precise positioning of control variable and improve the accuracy of the algorithm.

Also an optimal load shedding non-linear programming model is estabilished which is solved by primal-dual interior point algorithm. Futhermore, the severe failure states are filtered and sorted through weighting the sampling probability of failure states and optimal load shedding quantity to find out operational risks and weaknesses of transmission systems. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method have been verified on IEEE-RTS system.",

During the searching process, a global optimized objective function is constructed by convex combination of optimized objective functions of subsystems, and this distributed optimization problem is solved by iteration and network communication to improve the convergence property by which the Nash equilibrium point is achieved. Besides, according to the intercommunity between distributed model predictive control algorithm and multi-agent technology and by use of the priority of Matlab and JADE in optimization calculation and agent-oriented programming, a multi-agent system suitable to distributed model predictive control algorithm is proposed and constructed, by which the parallel solution of receding optimization among subsystems is implemented. Simulation results of New England 10-machine 39-bus system show that the proposed method is effective.",

Methods MRC-5 cultured in vitro were individed into 4 groups, including normoxia control, hypoxia, hypoxia and staurosporine (SP), hypoxia and erigeron breviscapus. The expression of hypoxiainducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), pro-collal and phospho-smad2 (p-smad2) were evaluated by Western blot. The level of collagen type I , MMP1 and TIMP1 in supernatant fluid were detected by ELISA. Results Expressed procoll \u03b11, p-smad2 in MRC-5 cells under nomoxia were detected, but not HIF-1\u03b1. A low level of.collagen type I , MMP1 and TIMP1 was also detected in the cell supernatant. In nomoxia secreted pro-coll\u03b11, p-smad2, collagen type I , MMP1 and TIMP1, hardly secreted HIF-1\u03b1. Under hypoxia, the expression of all of them was increased when compared with those of under nomoxia condition (P<0. 05). MMP1 expression was significantly further upregluted by pre-cubation with SP in hypoxia, however collagen type I , TIMP1 in supernatant fluid and pro-collal, p-smad2 in cells were inhibited (P<0. 05, vs. hypoxia group). Treated with Erigeron breviscapus (12. 5 \u03bcg/mL, 50 \u03bczg/mL) under hypoxia condition, significantly reduced expression of pro-collal, p-smad2, HIF-1\u03b1 in MRC-5 cells and collagen type I , MMP1, TIMP1 in supernatant fluid were observed (P<0. 05, vs. hypoxia). Conclusion Erigeron breviscapus can decrase the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 of MRC-5 cells under hypoxia condition by inhibit the expression of collagen type I and TIMP1 partly through the Smad2 signaling pathways.",

At the 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st day, 5 rats from each group were killed and hematoxylin and eosin stain (HE stain) was applied to observe the pathological change in the lung of rats, immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the protein level of TGF-beta1, Col I. RT-PCR was performed to detect the mRNA levels of TGF-beta1 and Col I. Western blot to detect the expression of Smad4. Besides, the TNF-alpha in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) were determined by ELISA.Results of HE stain demonstrated that the mild edema and inflammatory cell infiltration appeared in the lung tissue at the 3rd day, and gradually aggravated inflammation were observed as the treated time extended; meanwhile the interalveolar septum become thicker and thicker as the time of exposing to normobaric hypoxia increased. Compared with the normoxia group, not only the protein expression of TGF-beta1, Smad4 and Col I, but also the mRNA expression of TGF-beta1 and Col I were elevated (P < 0.01) in normobaric hypoxia group as the treatment time extended. Besides, a positive correlation (r = 0.944, P < 0.01) between the protein level of TGF-beta1 and Smad4 was observed and an up-regulated TNF-alpha in the BALF was also noticed.Normobaric hypoxia could cause pulmonary edema and inflammation by up-regulating expression of TNF-alpha, activating the TGF-beta1/Smads Signaling Pathway, and increasing the synthesization of Col I, the deposition of extracellular matrix as well as the interalveolar septum thickness.",

Methods: Human embryonic fibroblasts were cultured under hypoxic condition (37 \u00b0C,5%CO 2,2%O 2, 93%N 2) for 0 h, 1. 5 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 60 h respectively. The protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1, RhoA, ROCK1and CTGF were assayed by Western blot. RT-PCR was performed to detect the mRNA levels of HIF-1\u03b1, ROCK1, CTGF and Col I. The concentration of collagen type I (Col I) in fibroblast cells supernatant were determined by ELISA. Results: (1) Basal levels of RhoA, ROCK1, CTGF protein of MRC-5 were observed in normoxia, but the protein levels of RhoA, ROCK1 and CTGF were up-regulated after 1. 5 h of hypoxia and increased further with longer exposure to hypoxia. It also demonstrated significant positive correlation between the protein levels of RhoA, ROCK1 and CTGF at different time points of hypoxia. (2)After 1. 5 h, mRNA expression of ROCK1, CTGF and Col I was elevated and increased further with longer exposure to hypoxia and peaked after 60 h of hypoxia compared to normoxia. (3)Compared with normoxia, the concentration of Col I in fibroblast cells supernatant increased in different time points of hypoxia and peaked after 24 h of hypoxia. Conclusion: Different time points of hypoxia all signi cantly up-regulated the expression of protein and mRNA of CTGF and increased the secretion of Col I. Hypoxia could represent a potential brotic stimulus possiblely through activation of the RHO/RHO signaling pathway, up-regulating the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and CTGF, triggering a series of brotic responses.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of hypoxic condition on the expressions of RhoA, ROCK1and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in human fetal fibroblasts, and the beneficial effects of fasudil in the hypoxia-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Methods Human fetal fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) were cultured under hypoxic condition (37 \u2103, 5 %CO2, 2%O2 , 93%N2) for 0 , 6, 12, and 24 h respectively. The cells cultured in a condition of 21%O2, 74%N2 and 5% CO2 were used as control. The effect of fasudil was investigated in normal group, hypoxia group and intervention groups (6, 12 or 25 \u03bcmol/L fasudil) under the corresponding oxygen condition for 24 h. The protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1, RhoA, ROCK1, and CTGF were assayed by Western blotting. RT-PCR was performed to detect CTGF mRNA levels. Cell viability was measured by thiazolyl blue (MTT) assay. The concentration of collagen type \u2160 (Col \u2160) in fibroblast cells\u2019 supernatant were determined by ELISA. Results The protein levels of RhoA, ROCK1 and CTGF were up-regulated by hypoxia in a time-dependent manner. Different concentrations of fasudil all inhibited the expressions of protein and mRNA of CTGF after 24 h of hypoxia (P<0.01, 0.05). Compared with the hypoxia for 24 h, fasudil all inhibited cell proliferation activity and the secretion of Col \u2160 in fibroblast cells\u2019s supernatant for hypoxia 24 h (P<0.01). Conclusion Hypoxia exerts a potential brotic stimulus probabily through activating Rho/Rock signal pathway, thus up-regulates the expression of CTGF, and finally triggers a series of brotic responses. These changes could be markedly inhibited by fasudil. Fasudil attenuates hypoxia-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which may be due to suppressing the Rho/Rock signal pathway.",

The degradation of nucleic acids is of great significance for biological contaminants such as viruses. In the presentwork, visible light-induced plasmid DNA damage catalyzed by a CdSe/ZnS-photosensitized nano-TiO2 film (QDs-TiO2 film) was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and agarose gel electrophoresis. Illuminated by visible light, the supercoiled pUC18 DNA could be damaged into nicked-circle and linear conformations by the QDs-TiO2 film. The percentage of different conformations of damaged DNA changed with illumination time. A statistical rule for calculating the quantity of supercoiled DNA has been established to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the QDs-TiO2 film based on AFM results. Visible light-induced plasmid DNA damage catalyzed by the QDs-TiO2 film is characteristic of zero-order kinetics and the rate constant (k) is 3.5 x 10(-11) M x s(-1). Given an illumination time, the quantity of damaged supercoiled DNA catalyzed by the QDs-TiO2 film is constant.",

These TFNS can be easily manipulated, tracked, and conveniently used to capture and separate target cells. The presence of wheat germ agglutinin on the surface of WGA-TFNS was confirmed by FTIR, biorecognition of carboxymethyl chitin-modified quantum dots (CM-CT-QDs), and bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The success in recognizing DU-145 cells by the WGA-TFNS indicates that WGA-TFNS could be applicable.",

As a protein exploiting the receptor-mediated endocytosis for internalization, WGA is also a valuable model system for exploring the endocytic and exocytic pathway. In this study, quantum dot-based single-particle tracking was performed to investigate the transport of WGA in live cells, revealing firstly that the endocytic and exocytic processes of WGA were both actin- and microtubule-dependent, each including five stages. The vesicle fusion event occurred near the cytomembrane, followed by two destinies with WGA: shedding to the extracellular or reversing to the cytoplasm. These findings suggest a distinct and dynamic scenario for the transport of lectins following a receptor-mediated endo/exocytic pathway in live cells. This is important for the application of lectins as drug carriers and antineoplastic drugs in medicine, and also offers insights into the pathway of endocytosis and exocytosis.",

Here, quantum dots and gamma-Fe(2)O(3) magnetic nanoparticles were co-embedded into single swelling poly(styrene/acrylamide) copolymer nanospheres to fabricate fluorescent-magnetic bifunctional nanospheres. Subsequently, fluorescent-magnetic-biotargeting trifunctional nanobiosensors (TFNS) modified with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), peanut agglutinin (PNA) or Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) were conveniently produced so as to bind with A549 cells which are surface-expressed with N-acetylglucosamine, d-galactosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine residues. The values of WGA, PNA and DBA on each nanobiosensor were calculated to be 40, 14 and 60, respectively. These three kinds of lectin-modified trifunctional nanobiosensors (lectin-TFNS) can be used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the glycoconjugates on A549 cell surface. The fluorescence intensity of WGA-modified nanobiosensors related to N-acetylglucosamine on A549 cell surface was much higher than that of PNA-modified nanobiosensors corresponding to d-galactosamine and that of N-acetylgalactosamine-related DBA-modified nanobiosensors, which is consistent with the results detected by flow cytometry. Lectin-modified trifunctional nanobiosensors not only can quantify the different glycoconjugates on A549 cell surface, but also can recognize and isolate A549 cells. 0.5mg of WGA-modified fluorescent-magnetic trifunctional nanobiosensors could capture 7.0 x 10(4) A549 cells. Therefore, the lectin-modified trifunctional nanobiosensors may be applied in mapping the glycoconjugates on cell surfaces and for recognition and isolation of targeted cells.",

        "abstract": "Sensitive, rapid, and reliable detection of bacteria has always been pursued due to the great threat of the bacteria to human health. In this study, a convenient one-step strategy for detecting Salmonella typhimurium was developed. Immunomagnetic nanospheres (IMNS) and immunofluorescent nanospheres (IFNS) were used to specifically capture and recognize S. typhimurium simultaneously. After magnetic separation, the sandwich immune complexes (IMNS-bacteria-IFNS) were detected under a fluorescence microscope with a detection limit as low as ca. 10 CFU/mL. When they were detected by fluorescence spectrometer, a linear range was exhibited at the concentration from 10(5) to 10(7) CFU/mL with R(2) = 0.9994. Compared with the two-step detection strategy, in which the bacteria were first captured with the IMNS and subsequently identified with the IFNS, this one-step strategy simplified the detection process and improved the sensitivity. Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri both showed negative results with this method, indicating that this method had excellent selectivity and specificity. Moreover, this method had strong anti-interference ability, and it had been successfully used to detect S. typhimurium in synthetic samples (milk, fetal bovine serum, and urine), showing the potential application in practice.",

        "abstract": "An integrated smart microfluidic device consisting of nickel micropillars, microvalves, and microchannels was developed for specific capture and sorting of cells. A regular hexagonal array of nickel micropillars was integrated on the bottom of a microchannel by standard photolithography, which can generate strong induced magnetic field gradients under an external magnetic field to efficiently trap superparamagnetic beads (SPMBs) in a flowing stream, forming a bed with sufficient magnetic beads as a capture zone. Fluids could be manipulated by programmed controlling the integrated air-pressure-actuated microvalves, based on which in situ bio-functionalization of SPMBs trapped in the capture zone was realized by covalent attachment of specific proteins directly to their surface on the integrated microfluidic device. In this case, only small volumes of protein solutions (62.5 nL in the capture zone; 375 nL in total volume needed to fill the device from inlet A to the intersection of outlet channels F and G) can meet the need for protein! The newly designed microfluidic device reduced greatly chemical and biological reagent consumption and simplified drastically tedious manual handling. Based on the specific interaction between wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and N-acetylglucosamine on the cell membrane, A549 cancer cells were effectively captured and sorted on the microfluidic device. Capture efficiency ranged from 62 to 74%. The integrated microfluidic device provides a reliable technique for cell sorting.",

Detection was achieved on a fluorescence spectrophotometer without additional auxiliary instruments, and the detection limit was about 100 pM. Here, QDs-encoded fluorescent nanospheres (FNS) with different photoluminescent properties, and magnetic nanospheres (MNS) were separately fabricated by stepwise assembly of hydrophobic QDs or nano-\u03b3-Fe2O3 on the surface of branched poly(ethylene imine) (PEI)-coated nanospheres in precisely controlled amounts, finally followed by silica encapsulation. FNS-labeled probe DNAs and MNS-labeled capture DNAs were used to hybridize with the corresponding targets at the same time. After magnetic separation, the sandwich-structured adducts were measured by fluorescence spectrophotometry. The results indicated that the targets could be detected with high sensitivity. This method is convenient, fast enough, and capable of high anti-interference. Therefore, it is expected to be used for simultaneous detection and separation of multiple targets at high levels of purity and throughput.",

The process was highly reproducible for facile functionalization of QDs via simultaneous self-assembly of biocompatible PEG molecules onto their surface. An optimized molar ratio of NTA-terminated amphiphilic polymer to DSPE-PEG-COOH was used to obtain NTA-functionalized QDs for site-specific labeling of prion proteins (PrP(C)) expressed on cell surfaces. Fabricated NTA-functionalized QDs can be a good candidate used for real-time visualization of PrP(C) in single live cells so as to clarify the nosogenesis of pathogenic scrapie prion protein (PrP(Sc)).",

        "abstract": "Bead-based optical encoding or magnetic encoding techniques are promising in high-throughput multiplexed detection and separation of numerous species under complicated conditions. Therefore, a self-assembly strategy implemented in an organic solvent is put forward to fabricate fluorescent-magnetic dual-encoded nanospheres. Briefly, hydrophobic trioctylphosphine oxide-capped CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) and oleic acid-capped nano-\u03b3-Fe2O3 magnetic particles are directly, selectively and controllably assembled on branched poly(ethylene imine)-coated nanospheres without any pretreatment, which is crucial to keep the high quantum yield of QDs and good dispersibility of \u03b3-Fe2O3. Owing to the tunability of coating amounts of QDs and \u03b3-Fe2O3 as well as controllable fluorescent emissions of deposited-QDs, dual-encoded nanospheres with different photoluminescent emissions and gradient magnetic susceptibility are constructed. Using this improved layer-by-layer self-assembly approach, deposition of hydrophobic nanoparticles onto hydrophilic carriers in organic media can be easily realized; meanwhile, fluorescent-magnetic dual-functional nanospheres can be further equipped with readable optical and magnetic addresses. The resultant fluorescent-magnetic dual-encoded nanospheres possess both the unique optical properties of QDs and the superparamagnetic properties of \u03b3-Fe2O3, exhibiting good monodispersibility, huge encoding capacity and nanoscale particle size. Compared with the encoded microbeads reported by others, the nanometre scale of the dual-encoded nanospheres gives them minimum steric hindrance and higher flexibility.",

To achieve this goal, a set of fluorescent, magnetic, dual-encoded multifunctional bioprobes has been constructed by co-embedding different-sized quantum dots and varying amounts of \u03b3-Fe(2)O(3) magnetic nanoparticles into swollen poly(styrene/acrylamide) copolymer nanospheres. The dual-encoded bioprobes, which possessed different photoluminescent property and magnetic susceptibility, were proven to be capable of simultaneously recognizing and separating multiple components from a complex sample when three kinds of lectins were used as the targets. The lectins were separated with high efficiency and kept their bioactivity during the process. Compared to the conventional batchwise separation, this method does not require a large number of sequential reaction steps, which is economical of time and can be very reagent-saving. By combining the multiplexing capability of quantum dots with the superparamagnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles, this dual-encoded technique is expected to open new opportunities in high-throughput and multiplex bioassays, such as cell sorting, proteomical and genomical applications, drug screening etc.",

        "abstract": "Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders resulting from structural conversion of the cellular isoform of PrP(C) to the infectious scrapie isoform PrP(Sc). It is believed that such structural alteration may occur within the internalization pathway. However, there is no direct evidence to support this hypothesis. Employing quantum dots (QDs) as a probe, we have recorded a real-time movie demonstrating the process of prion internalization in a living cell for the first time. The entire internalization process can be divided into four discrete but connected stages. In addition, using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin to disrupt cell membrane cholesterol, we show that lipid rafts play an important role in locating cellular PrP(C) to the cell membrane and in initiating PrP(C) endocytosis.",

        "abstract": "Regeneration of injured neurons in complicated three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments is a key approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Microfluidics provides a versatile tool to recapitulate cellular microenvironments in vitro, but it still remains a big challenge to construct a microfluidic platform incorporating extracellular matrix (ECM) structures and highly controlled 3D gradients of soluble factors to study the regeneration of injured neurons. In this work, we developed a microfluidic device which can provide multiple adjustable gradients in a 3D ECM to investigate the regeneration of injured central nervous system (CNS) neurons in response to natural small molecules. With interconnecting but independently controlled central channels, asymmetrically designed side channels and a series of microgrooves connecting the central channels, spatially and temporally controlled 3D biochemical gradients can be generated inside collagen hydrogel in the central channels. This allows quantitative analysis of guided axon growth and the orientational regeneration of injured dopaminergic neurons by 3D chemical gradients of three natural molecules. This study demonstrates a promising microfluidic platform for the generation of highly controlled 3D biochemical gradients in an ECM to quantitatively study neuronal responses, thereby potentially facilitating drug screening and optimization of treatment protocols for neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "abstract": "Exosomes as cell-derived vesicles have the potential to be novel biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis of cancers. However, cost-effective detection of exosomes in routine clinical settings is still challenging. Herein, we present a ZnO nanowires coated three-dimensional (3D) scaffold chip device for effective immunocapture and classically visible and colorimetric detection of exosomes. The chip device is composed of 3D polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) scaffold skeleton covered by free-standing ZnO nanowire array. The interconnected micropores of 3D scaffold induces the fluid flow with chaotic or vortex feature, and ZnO nanowire array provides large surface area for immobilization of exosome specific antibody as well as size exclusion-like effect for retaining exosomes. These synergistically and significantly enhance the capture of exosomes at a high flow rate. The captured exosomes are detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled antibody which can initiate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-based colorimetric sensing. The quantitative readout of exosomes is easily accomplished by UV-vis spectrometry or microplate reader with a linear range of 2.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 to 2.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 particles/\u03bcL and a minimal detectable concentration of 2.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 particles/\u03bcL. This chip device was applicable to clinical samples where cancer patients demonstrate statistically significant increase in exosomes compared with healthy individuals. Thus, our chip device is cost-effective and easy-to-use, facilitating visible and colorimetric assay with high sensitivity toward clinical applications.",

However, there exist few systems capable of highly efficient capture and release of single CTCs with high viability for downstream analysis and culture. Herein, we designed a near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive substrate for highly efficient immunocapture and biocompatible site-release of CTCs by a combination of the photothermal effect of gold nanorods (GNRs) and a thermoresponsive hydrogel. The substrate was fabricated by imprinting target cancer cells on a GNR-pre-embedded gelatin hydrogel. Micro/nanostructures generated by cell imprinting produce artificial receptors for cancer cells to improve capture efficiency. Temperature-responsive gelatin dissolves rapidly at 37 \u00b0C; this allows bulk recovery of captured CTCs at physiological temperature or site-specific release of single CTCs by NIR-mediated photothermal activation of embedded GNRs....",

In the present study, we developed a programmable DNA-responsive microchip for the highly efficient capture and nondestructive release of CTCs via nucleic acid hybridization. Transparent and patternable substrates with hierarchical architectures were integrated into the microchip with herringbone grooves, resulting in greatly enhanced cell-surface interaction via herringbone micromixers, more binding sites, and better matched topographical interactions. In combination with a high-affinity aptamer, target cancer cells were specifically and efficiently captured on the chip. Captured cancer cells were gently released from the chip under physiological conditions using toehold-mediated strand displacement, without any destructive factors for cells or substrates. More importantly, aptamer-containing DNA sequences on the surface of the retrieved cancer cells could be further amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), facilitating the detection of cell surface biomarkers and characterization of the CTCs. Furthermore, this system was extensively applied to the capture and release of CTCs from patients\u00b4 blood samples, demonstrating a promising high-performance platform for CTC enrichment, release, and characterization.",

To realize the release of CTCs without disruption of their viability for further culture and analysis, we designed an effective photocontrolled CTC capture/release system by combination of photochemistry and immunomagnetic separation. 7-Aminocoumarin was synthesized as the phototrigger to bridge the connection between the anti-EpCAM antibody and the magnetic beads. The coumarin moieties produced cleavage of a C-O bond under both ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) light illumination, breaking the bridge and releasing CTCs from the immunomagnetic beads. Compared with conventional immunomagnetic separation systems, the negative influence of absorbed immunomagnetic beads on further CTCs culture and analysis was effectively eliminated. The system can specifically recognize 10(2) MCF-7 cells in 1 mL of human whole blood samples with 90% efficiency and 85% purity. Under the irradiation of UV and NIR light, 73 \u00b1 4% and 52 \u00b1 6% of captured cells were released with a viability of 90% and 97%, respectively. Furthermore, this technique has been used to detect CTCs from whole blood of cancer patients with high purity. This study demonstrates that the photochemical-based immunomagnetic separation method for isolating, releasing and culturing CTCs from clinic patients may provide new opportunities for cancer diagnosis and personalized therapy.",

        "abstract": "In order to simulate the spatial distribution and temporal variation of volatile nitrate aerosols,it is necessary to introduce a thermodynamic equilibrium model and calculate the concentration under the state of equilibrium from the viewpoint of chemical thermodynamics.However,it costs much time to carry out a large-scale and long-term simulation because the thermodynamic equilibrium model contains a lot of species and reactions.The inorganic salt thermodynamic equilibrium model ISORROPIA is simplified using look-up table method.A look-up table for concentrations of 5 species(sulfate,nitrate,ammonium,nitric acid and ammonia) under the state of equilibrium is constructed according to various conditions of effecting factors(temperature,relative humidity,NH3+NH4+,HNO3+NO3-and H2SO4+SO42-).The regional climate chemistry modeling system(RegCCMS) is an on-line coupled modeling system which contains the regional climate model(RegCM3) and the tropospheric atmosphere chemistry model(TACM).The look-up table scheme and the thermodynamic equilibrium model are introduced into TACM to treat nitrate,sulfate and ammonium.These two schemes are respectively adopted in RegCCMS to investigate spatial distribution of nitrate aerosol over China in January and July of 2003.Nitrate aerosol is mainly distributed in Sichuan,Yunnan,Guizhou,Hebei,Henan,Shandong in January and Henan,Hebei,Shandong,Jiangsu in July,which is roughly consistent with the distribution of the industry development.Influenced by temperature on thermodynamic equilibrium,wet scavenging of precipitation and the monsoon climate,the nitrate concentration is high in winter,and is very low in summer.The results of monthly average surface concentration show that look-up table method has a good agreement with the thermodynamic equilibrium model in both quantity and distribution.The effect of look-up table method is better on land than on ocean.Look-up table method can save about 80% of the computing time compared with the thermodynamic equilibrium model,greatly improving the computational efficiency.The surface concentrations every 6 hours in several cities got from the look-up table method and the thermodynamic equilibrium model are compared.The correlation coefficients of these two schemes in Chongqing,Xi'an and Xiamen are 0.99,0.99,0.97 in January and 0.75,0.81,0.86 in July.The results show that look-up table method is able to simulate the characteristic of temporal variation.Due to higher temperature and humidity,differences between these two schemes are more obvious in July than those in January.As a whole,the look-up table method can deal with the thermodynamic equilibrium processes successfully and reduce time for calculation significantly,therefore it has broad application prospect in research of climate effects of aerosols.",

A photochemical box model is employed to interpret the possible mechanism. The simulation shows that elevated concentration of particulate matter can increase the aerosol optical depth by 20%\u201340% and reduce averaged photolysis rates of NO2 and O3 and concentration of OH and HO2 by 20%\u201330% and 20%\u201350%, respectively, which leads to a 30%\u201340% decrease in the net photochemical production rate of O3. The results indicate that the effects of atmospheric particles on photochemistry and the oxidation ability of the atmosphere are responsible for the reduction of the observed surface O3 concentration.",

With the aid of the model, tropospheric air quality over the typical city cluster in China was studied, and the capacity of look-up table method to predict air pollution complex episodes was evaluated. Firstly, based on the state-of-the-art gas phase chemical modules and aerosol modules in WRF-CHEM, a new box model named WRFBOX was built. Secondly, the key physical and chemical factors that may affect tropospheric photochemistry and the formation of aerosols were investigated by using WRFBOX. And then, the look-up tables for photochemical reactions, formation of inorganic aerosols and formation of secondary organic aerosols were constructed by calculating the concentrations of pollutants in various conditions according to these key factors. Finally, the look-up tables were applied in RegSRRMS to simulate concentrations of trace gases and aerosols in Pearl River Delta Region and its surrounding areas during an air pollution complex episode in March 2000. The results showed that the look-up table scheme could not only keep the basic features of atmospheric chemical reactions, but also significantly increase the computational efficiency by saving 57% operation time.

        "abstract": "In this study, samples of size-fractionated particulate matter were collected continuously using a 9-size interval cascade impactor at an urban site in Nanjing, before, during and after the Asian Youth Games (AYG), from July to September of 2013, and the Youth Olympic Games (YOG), from July to September of 2014. First, elemental concentrations, water-soluble ions including Cl, NO, SO, NH, K, Na and Ca, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were analysed. Then, the source apportionment of the fine and coarse particulate matter was carried out using the chemical mass balance (CMB) model. The average PM concentrations were 90.4\u00b120.0\u03bcg/m during the 2013 AYG and 70.6\u00b125.3\u03bcg/m during the 2014 YOG. For PM the average concentrations were 50.0\u00b112.8\u03bcg/m in 2013 and 34.6\u00b117.0\u03bcg/m in 2014. Investigations showed that the average concentrations of particles declined significantly from 2013 to 2014, and concentrations were at the lowest levels during the events. Results indicated that OC, EC, sulfate and crustal elements have significant monthly and size-based variations. The major components, including crustal elements, water-soluble ions and carbonaceous aerosol accounted for 75.3-91.9% of the total particulate mass concentrations during the sampling periods. Fugitive dust, coal combustion dust, iron dust, construction dust, soil dust, vehicle exhaust, secondary aerosols and sea salt have been classified as the main emissions in Nanjing. The source apportionment results indicate that the emissions from fugitive dust, which was the most abundance emission source during the 2013 AYG, contributed to 23.0% of the total particle mass. However, fugitive dust decreased to 6.2% of the total particle mass during the 2014 YOG. Construction dust (14.7% versus 7.8% for the AYG and the YOG, respectively) and secondary sulfate aerosol (9.3% versus 8.0% for the AYG and the YOG, respectively) showed the same trend as fugitive dust, suggesting that the mitigation measures of controlling particles from the paved roads, construction and industry worked more efficiently during the YOG.",

        "abstract": "Samples of size-fractionated particles were collected from local natural and anthropogenic sources in two industrial cities in the Yangtze River Delta, using either grab/resuspension sampling or ambient air sampling. The chemical characterizations of twenty one source profiles were obtained, based on elements (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb and Zn), soluble ions (Cl, NO, SO, NH, K, Na and Ca) and carbonaceous material such as organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). The profiles vary between sources from different areas, as well as between different particulate sizes. Results show that particulate matter that originated as soil dust, construction dust and fugitive dust is typically rich in crustal elements, especially Al, Ca, Fe and Mg, while the presence of calcium is found to be a hallmark of the cement industry and ceramic industry. Dominant compositions of particles from coal-fired power plants are variable, with OC ranging from 2.2%-27%. Garbage-fired power plant and cooking smoke particulate emissions are enriched in Na, Cl, OC and K due to the presence of salty and organic matter. The element Fe, ranging from 6.1% to 26.0%, is found to be an important marker for steel production dust. Vehicle exhaust profiles are characterized by high abundances of OC (12.1%-53.6%) and EC (3.9%-20.0%). Burning of straw results in K (1.6%-7.2%) and OC (12.4%-25.9%) being the dominant composition. Preliminary work has also been done on establishing local industrial profiles such as textile, ceramic and electroplating industries. This work could be used in receptor model studies to estimate the contributions of different sources to the size-fractionated particulate matter in the Yangtze River Delta.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To improve our understanding of the interplay among local and regional photochemical pollutants in the typical city of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, the concurrent observation of O 3  and NO x  concentrations at an urban and a suburban site in Nanjing during 2008 is presented. In general, the annual mean O 3  concentration is 2.35\u00a0ppbv lower in the downtown than at suburban due to higher NO x  pollution levels correlated with heavy traffic. At both sites, O 3  shows a distinct seasonality with the spring maximum and the winter minimum, while the minimum concentration of NO x  appears in summertime. Besides the chemical processes of O 3  sensitivity in the daytime and the NO x  titration at night, meteorological conditions also play an essential role in these monthly and diurnal variations. The ozone weekend effect that can be attributed to the weekly routine of human activities is observed in the urban atmosphere of Nanjing as well, with O 3  concentrations 2.09\u00a0ppbv higher and NO x  concentrations 6.20\u00a0ppbv lower on weekends than on weekdays. The chemical coupling of NO, NO 2  and O 3  is investigated to show that the OX-component (O 3  and NO 2 ) partitioning point occurs at about 35\u00a0ppbv for NO x , with O 3  being the dominant form at lower levels and NO 2  dominating at higher levels. And it is also discovered that the level of OX is made up of two contributions, including the regional contribution affected by regional background O 3  level and the local contribution correlated with the level of primary pollution. The diurnal peak of regional contribution appears 2\u20135\u00a0h after the peak of local contribution, implying that OX in Nanjing might prominently affected by the pollutants from a short distance. The highest regional contribution and the second highest local contribution lead to the spring peak of O 3  observed in Nanjing, whereas the highest local contribution and the moderate regional contribution make the O 3  concentrations in summer higher than those in autumn and winter. Our results reveal the important environment impacts from meteorological conditions and human activities in the YRD region, and can help to understand O 3  pollution in these polluted areas by just using the conventional observations.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we mainly simulate the effects of aerosols on regional climate in southern China (SC) and northern China (NC) and compare the differences of aerosol climatic effects in strong/weak summer monsoon years with a modified regional climate model RegCM4. The results show that the total climatic effects of aerosols cause the decline of averaged air temperature and precipitation of SC and NC in summer. In NC, the strength of temperature drop in strong summer monsoon years is higher than that in weak summer monsoon years, indicating the possible impact from the different changes of radiation, circulation, and precipitation. The decrease of precipitation is more significant in NC in weak summer monsoon years, while it is stronger in SC in strong summer monsoon years due to the difference of aerosol distribution as well as the effects on circulation and cloud microphysics processes. Besides, aerosol effects also cause a decrease of zonal wind at 850\u2009hPa in SC and an increase in NC. The cooling center is more northerly and stronger in strong monsoon year, while it is more southerly and weaker in weak summer monsoon years, which results in the differences of vertical circulation anomaly and meridional wind anomaly at 850\u2009hPa. In weak summer monsoon years, meridional wind at 850\u2009hPa is increased in NC, while it is found to be decreased in SC. In strong summer monsoon years, meridional winds at 850\u2009hPa in both NC and SC are weakened. However, the decrease in SC is much more distinct and clear.",

        "title": "Modeling of the anthropogenic heat flux and its effect on regional meteorology and air quality over the Yangtze River Delta region, China",
        "abstract": "Abstract.  Anthropogenic heat (AH) emissions from human activities caused by urbanization can affect the city environment. Based on the energy consumption and the gridded demographic data, the spatial distribution of AH emission over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is estimated. Meanwhile, a new method for the AH parameterization is developed in the WRF/Chem model, which incorporates the gridded AH emission data with the seasonal and diurnal variations into the simulations. By running this upgraded WRF/Chem for 2 typical months in 2010, the impacts of AH on the meteorology and air quality over the YRD region are studied. The results show that the AH fluxes over the YRD have been growing in recent decades. In 2010, the annual-mean values of AH over Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang are 14.46, 2.61 and 1.63  W  m \u22122 , respectively, with the high value of 113.5  W  m \u22122  occurring in the urban areas of Shanghai. These AH emissions can significantly change the urban heat island and urban-breeze circulations in the cities of the YRD region. In Shanghai, 2  m air temperature increases by 1.6  \u00b0C in January and 1.4  \u00b0C in July, the PBLH (planetary boundary layer height) rises up by 140  m in January and 160  m in July, and 10  m wind speed is enhanced by 0.7  m  s \u22121  in January and 0.5  m  s \u22121  in July, with a higher increment at night. The enhanced vertical movement can transport more moisture to higher levels, which causes the decrease in water vapor at ground level and the increase in the upper PBL (planetary boundary layer), and thereby induces the accumulative precipitation to increase by 15\u201330  % over the megacities in July. The adding of AH can impact the spatial and vertical distributions of the simulated pollutants as well. The concentrations of primary air pollutants decrease near the surface and increase at the upper levels, due mainly to the increases in PBLH, surface wind speed and upward air vertical movement. But surface O 3  concentrations increase in the urban areas, with maximum changes of 2.5  ppb in January and 4  ppb in July. Chemical direct (the rising up of air temperature directly accelerates surface O 3  formation) and indirect (the decrease in NO  x   at the ground results in the increase in surface O 3 ) effects can play a significant role in O 3  changes over this region. The meteorology and air pollution predictions in and around large urban areas are highly sensitive to the anthropogenic heat inputs, suggesting that AH should be considered in the climate and air quality assessments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Anthropogenic heat (AH) emissions from human activities can change the urban circulation and thereby affect the air pollution in and around cities. Based on statistic data, the spatial distribution of AH flux in South China is estimated. With the aid of the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem), in which the AH parameterization is developed to incorporate the gridded AH emissions with temporal variation, simulations for January and July in 2014 are performed over South China. By analyzing the differences between the simulations with and without adding AH, the impact of AH on regional meteorology and air quality is quantified. The results show that the regional annual mean AH fluxes over South China are only 0.87  W  m \u22122 , but the values for the urban areas of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region can be close to 60  W  m \u22122 . These AH emissions can significantly change the urban heat island and urban-breeze circulations in big cities. In the PRD city cluster, 2  m air temperature rises by 1.1\u00b0 in January and over 0.5\u00b0 in July, the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) increases by 120  m in January and 90  m in July, 10  m wind speed is intensified to over 0.35  m  s \u22121  in January and 0.3  m  s \u22121  in July, and accumulative precipitation is enhanced by 20\u201340  % in July. These changes in meteorological conditions can significantly impact the spatial and vertical distributions of air pollutants. Due to the increases in PBLH, surface wind speed and upward vertical movement, the concentrations of primary air pollutants decrease near the surface and increase in the upper levels. But the vertical changes in O 3  concentrations show the different patterns in different seasons. The surface O 3  concentrations in big cities increase with maximum values of over 2.5  ppb in January, while O 3  is reduced at the lower layers and increases at the upper layers above some megacities in July. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that chemical effects can play a significant role in O 3  changes over South China in winter, while the vertical movement can be the dominant effect in some big cities in summer. Adding the gridded AH emissions can better describe the heterogeneous impacts of AH on regional meteorology and air quality, suggesting that more studies on AH should be carried out in climate and air quality assessments.",

        "title": "Integrated studies of a regional ozone pollution synthetically affected by subtropical high and typhoon system in the Yangtze River Delta region, China",
        "abstract": "Abstract.  Severe high ozone (O 3 ) episodes usually have close relations to synoptic systems. A regional continuous O 3  pollution episode was detected over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in China during 7\u201312\u00a0August 2013, in which the O 3  concentrations in more than half of the cities exceeded the national air quality standard. The maximum hourly concentration of O 3  reached 167.1  ppb. By means of the observational analysis and the numerical simulation, the characteristics and the essential impact factors of the typical regional O 3  pollution are comprehensively investigated. The observational analysis shows that the atmospheric subsidence dominated by the western Pacific subtropical high plays a crucial role in the formation of high-level O 3 . The favorable weather conditions, such as extremely high temperature, low relative humidity and weak wind speed, caused by the abnormally strong subtropical high are responsible for the trapping and the chemical production of O 3  in the boundary layer. In addition, when the YRD cities are at the front of Typhoon Utor, the periphery circulation of typhoon system can enhance the downward airflows and cause worse air quality. However, when the typhoon system weakens the subtropical high, the prevailing southeasterly surface wind leads to the mitigation of the O 3  pollution. The integrated process rate (IPR) analysis incorporated in the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model is applied to further illustrate the combined influence of subtropical high and typhoon system in this O 3  episode. The results show that the vertical diffusion (VDIF) and the gas-phase chemistry (CHEM) are two major contributors to O 3  formation. During the episode, the contributions of VDIF and CHEM to O 3  maintain the high values over the YRD region. On 10\u201312 August, the cities close to the sea are apparently affected by the typhoon system, with the contribution of VDIF increasing to 28.45  ppb  h \u22121  in Shanghai and 19.76  ppb  h \u22121  in Hangzhou. In contrast, the cities far away from the sea can hardly be affected by the periphery circulation of typhoon system. When the typhoon system significantly weakens the subtropical high, the contribution values of all individual processes decrease to a low level in all YRD cities. These results provide an insight for the O 3  pollution synthetically impacted by the western Pacific subtropical high and the tropical cyclone system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Observational studies of aerosol optical properties are useful for reducing uncertainties in estimations of aerosol radiative forcing and forecasting visibility. In this study, the observed near-surface aerosol optical properties in urban Nanjing are analysed from March\u00a02014 to February\u00a02016. Results show that near-surface urban aerosols in Nanjing are mainly from local emissions and the surrounding regions. They have lower loadings but are more scattering than aerosols in most cities in China. The annual mean aerosol extinction coefficient (EC), single-scattering albedo (SSA) and asymmetry parameter (ASP) at 550  nm are 381.96  Mm \u22121 , 0.9 and 0.57, respectively. The aerosol absorption coefficient (AAC) is about 1 order of magnitude smaller than its scattering coefficient (SC). However, the absorbing aerosol has a larger Angstrom exponent (AAE) value, 1.58 at 470\u2215660  nm, about 0.2 larger than the scattering aerosols (SAE). All the aerosol optical properties follow a near-unimodal pattern, and their values are mostly concentrated around their averages, accounting for more than 60  % of the total samplings. Additionally, they have substantial seasonality and diurnal variations. High levels of SC and AAC all appear in winter due to higher aerosol and trace gas emissions. AAE (ASP) is the smallest (largest) in summer, possibly because of high relative humidity (RH) which also causes considerably larger SC and smaller SAE, although intensive gas-to-particle transformation could produce a large number of finer scattering aerosols in this season. Seasonality of EC is different from the columnar aerosol optical depth. Larger AACs appear during the rush hours of the day while SC and back-scattering coefficient (Bsp) only peak in the early morning. Aerosols are fresher in the daytime than at night-time, leading to their larger Angstrom exponent and smaller ASP. Different temporal variations between AAC and SC cause the aerosols to be more absorbing (smaller SSA) in autumn, winter and around rush hours. ASP has a good quasi-log-normal growth trend with increasing SC when RH is below 60  %. The correlation between AAC and SC at the site is close but a little smaller than that in suburban Nanjing in spring. Atmospheric visibility decreases exponentially with increasing EC or SC, more sharply in spring and summer, and it could be further deteriorated with increasing SSA and ASP.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The natural emissions of ozone precursors (NO x  and VOCs) are sensitive to climate. Future climate change can impact O 3  concentrations by perturbing these emissions. To better estimate the variation of natural emissions under different climate conditions and understand its effect on surface O 3 , we model the present and the future air quality over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region by running different simulations with the aid of the WRF-CALGRID model system that contains a natural emission module. Firstly, we estimate the natural emissions at present and in IPCC A1B scenario. The results show that biogenic VOC emission and soil NO x  emission over YRD in 2008 is 657\u00a0Gg\u00a0C and 19.1\u00a0Gg\u00a0N, respectively. According to climate change, these emissions in 2050 will increase by 25.5% and 11.5%, respectively. Secondly, the effects of future natural emissions and meteorology on surface O 3  are investigated and compared. It is found that the variations in meteorological fields can significantly alter the spatial distribution of O 3  over YRD, with the increases of 5\u201315\u00a0ppb in the north and the decreases of\u00a0\u22125 to\u00a0\u221215\u00a0ppb in the south. However, only approximately 20% of the surface O 3  increases caused by climate change can be attributed to the natural emissions, with the highest increment up to 2.4\u00a0ppb. Finally, Ra (the ratio of impacts from NO x  and VOCs on O 3  formation) and H 2 O 2 /HNO 3  (the ratio between the concentrations of H 2 O 2  and HNO 3 ) are applied to study the O 3  sensitivity in YRD. The results show that the transition value of H 2 O 2 /HNO 3  will turn from 0.3 to 0.5 in 2008 to 0.4\u20130.8 in 2050. O 3  formation in the YRD region will be insensitive to VOCs under future climate condition, implying more NO x  need to be cut down. Our findings can help us understand O 3  variation trend and put forward the reasonable and effective pollution control policies in these famous polluted areas.",

        "title": "A modeling study on the effect of urban land surface forcing to regional meteorology and air quality over South China",
        "abstract": "Abstract   The change of land-use from natural to artificial surface induced by urban expansion can deeply impact the city environment. In this paper, the model WRF/Chem is applied to explore the effect of this change on regional meteorology and air quality over South China, where people have witnessed a rapid rate of urbanization. Two sets of urban maps are adopted to stand for the pre-urbanization and the present urban land-use distributions. Month-long simulations are conducted for January and July, 2014. The results show that urban expansion can obviously change the weather conditions around the big cities of South China. Especially in the Pearl River Delta region (PRD), the urban land-use change can increase the sensible heat flux by 40\u00a0W/m 2  in January and 80\u00a0W/m 2  in July, while decrease the latent heat flux about\u00a0\u221250\u00a0W/m 2  in January and\u00a0\u2212120\u00a0W/m 2  in July. In the consequent, 2-m air temperature (T 2 ) increases as much as 1\u00a0\u00b0C and 2\u00a0\u00b0C (respective to January and July), planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) rises up by 100\u2013150\u00a0m and 300\u00a0m, 10-m wind speed (WS 10 ) decreases by\u00a0\u22121.2\u00a0m/s and\u00a0\u22120.3\u00a0m/s, and 2-m specific humidity is reduced by\u00a0\u22120.8\u00a0g/kg and\u00a0\u22121.5\u00a0g/kg. Also, the precipitation in July can be increased as much as 120\u00a0mm, with more heavy rains and rainstorms. These variations of meteorological factors can significantly impact the spatial and vertical distribution of air pollutants as well. In PRD, the enhanced updraft can reduce the surface concentrations of PM 10  by\u00a0\u221240\u00a0\u03bcg/m 3  (30%) in January and\u00a0\u221280\u00a0\u03bcg/m 3  (50%) in July, but produce a correlating increase in the concentrations at higher atmospheric layers. However, according to the increase in T 2  and the decrease in surface NO, the surface concentrations of O 3  in PRD can increase by 2\u20136\u00a0ppb in January and 8\u201312\u00a0ppb in July. Meanwhile, there is a significant increase in the O 3  concentrations at upper layers above PRD, which should be attributed to the increase in air temperature and the enhanced upward transport of O 3  and its precursors. As for some relative small cities, such as Haikou, there is very little variation in surface PM 10  and O 3  in both months, implying less urbanization in these areas. Moreover, the depletion of O 3  by NO may be the main cause of the reduction of O 3  at upper layers in these small cities.",

        "abstract": "Land surface parameters play an important role in the land-atmosphere coupling and thus are critical to the weather and dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. This work aims at improving the meteorology and air quality simulations for a high-ozone (O3) event in the Yangtze River Delta urban cluster of China, through incorporation of satellite-derived land surface parameters. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) input to specify the land cover type, green vegetation fraction, leaf area index, albedo, emissivity, and deep soil temperature provides a more realistic representation of surface characteristics. Preliminary evaluations reveal clearly improved meteorological simulation with MODIS input compared with that using default parameters, particularly for temperature (from \u22122.5 to \u22121.7\u00b0C for mean bias) and humidity (from 9.7% to 4.3% for mean bias). The improved meteorology propagates through the air quality system, which results in better estimates for surface NO2 (from 11.5 to 8.0\u2009ppb for mean bias) and nocturnal O3 low-end concentration values (from \u221218.8 to \u221213.6\u2009ppb for mean bias). Modifications of the urban land surface parameters are the main reason for model improvement. The deeper urban boundary layer and intense updraft induced by the urban heat island are favorable for pollutant dilution, thus contributing to lower NO2 and elevated nocturnal O3. Furthermore, the intensified sea-land breeze circulation may exacerbate O3 pollution at coastal cities through pollutant recirculation. Improvement of mesoscale meteorology and air quality simulations with satellite-derived land surface parameters will be useful for air pollution monitoring and forecasting in urban areas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Dust aerosols could affect tropospheric photochemistry by interacting with solar radiation or providing reactive surfaces for heterogeneous reactions. This study examines the effects of a typical springtime dust storm (16\u201318 March, 2014) on ozone photochemistry over the downstream Nanjing megacity in eastern China. The on-line coupled Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model is used, with the inclusion of eight heterogeneous reactions on dust surfaces. Comparisons with satellite data and visibility record indicate that the model is capable of reproducing the onset time and downstream transport of this dust event. Dust particles act as a sink for all these trace gases examined here. The net decreases of O 3 , NO 2 , NO 3 , N 2 O 5 , HNO 3 ,  OH, HO 2   and H 2 O 2  in the atmosphere are estimated as\u00a0\u22126.1%,\u00a0\u221216.0%,\u00a0\u221237.4%,\u00a0\u221213.9%,\u00a0\u221247.7%,\u00a0\u22126.0%,\u00a0\u22129.2% and\u00a0\u221229.7%, of which more than 80% can be explained by heterogeneous chemistry on dust surfaces. The decreases in ground photolysis rate and  OH concentration, along with changes in other weather variables induced by dust aerosols (i.e., radiation and temperature) lead to lower photochemical activity and a small decrease of O 3  mixing ratio by roughly 0.5%. This study highlights the importance of dust interaction with ozone photochemistry, and also sets the stage for further investigation of the complicated dust impacts on tropospheric aerosol chemistry.",

        "title": "Regional severe particle pollution and its association with synoptic weather patterns in the Yangtze River Delta region, China",
        "abstract": "Abstract.  Regional air pollution is significantly associated with dominant weather systems. In this study, the relationship between the particle pollution over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region and weather patterns is investigated. First, the pollution characteristics of particles in the YRD are studied using in situ monitoring data (PM 2.5  and PM 10 ) in 16 cities and Terra/MODIS AOD (aerosol optical depth) products collected from December 2013 to November 2014. The results show that the regional mean value of AOD is high in the YRD, with an annual mean value of 0.71\u00b10.57. The annual mean particle concentrations in the cities of Jiangsu Province all exceed the national air quality standard. The pollution level is higher in inland areas, and the highest concentrations of PM 2.5  and PM 10  are 79 and 130  \u00b5g\u2006m \u22123 , respectively, in Nanjing. The PM 2.5   \u2009:\u2009  PM 10  ratios are typically high, thus indicating that PM 2.5  is the overwhelmingly dominant particle pollutant in the YRD. The wintertime peak of particle concentrations is tightly linked to the increased emissions during the heating season as well as adverse meteorological conditions. Second, based on NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis data, synoptic weather classification is conducted and five typical synoptic patterns are objectively identified. Finally, the synthetic analysis of meteorological fields and backward trajectories are applied to further clarify how these patterns impact particle concentrations. It is demonstrated that air pollution is more or less influenced by high-pressure systems. The relative position of the YRD to the anti-cyclonic circulation exerts significant effects on the air quality of the YRD. The YRD is largely influenced by polluted air masses from the northern and the southern inland areas when it is located at the rear of the East Asian major trough. The significant downward motion of air masses results in stable weather conditions, thereby hindering the diffusion of air pollutants. Thus, this pattern is quite favorable for the accumulation of pollutants in the YRD, resulting in higher regional mean PM 10  (116.5  \u00b1  66.9  \u00b5g\u2006m \u22123 ), PM 2.5  (75.9  \u00b1  49.9  \u00b5g\u2006m \u22123 ), and AOD (0.74) values. Moreover, this pattern is also responsible for the occurrence of most large-scale regional PM 2.5  (70.4  %) and PM 10  (78.3  %) pollution episodes. High wind speed and clean marine air masses may also play important roles in the mitigation of pollution in the YRD. Especially when the clean marine air masses account for a large proportion of all trajectories (i.e., when the YRD is affected by the cyclonic system or oceanic circulation), the air in the YRD has a lesser chance of being polluted. The observed correlation between weather patterns and particle pollution can provide valuable insight into making decisions about pollution control and mitigation strategies.",

        "title": "Inter-annual variation of aerosol pollution in East Asia and its relation with strong/weak East Asian winter monsoon",
        "abstract": "Abstract.  Aerosol has become one of the major air pollutants in East Asia, and its spatial distribution can be affected by the East Asian monsoon circulation. By means of the observational analysis and the numerical simulation, the inter-annual variation of wintertime aerosol pollution in East Asia and its association with strong/weak East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) are investigated in this study. Firstly, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer/Aerosol Optical Depth (MODIS/AOD) records during 2000\u20132013 are analyzed to reveal the inter-annual variation characteristics of aerosols. It is found that there is an increasing trend of AOD in East Asia over the last decade, implying the increasing aerosol loading in this region. The areas with obvious increasing AOD cover the Sichuan Basin (SCB), the North China Plain, and most of the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Plain in China. Secondly, the EAWM index (EAWMI) based on the characteristic of circulation are calculated to investigate the inter-annual variations of EAWM. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data are used in EAWMI calculation and meteorological analysis. Nine strong and thirteen weak EAWM years are identified from 1979 to 2014. In these strong EAWM years, the sea-land pressure contrast increases, the East Asian trough strengthens, and the northerly wind gets anomalous over East Asia. More cold air masses are forced to move southward by strengthened wind field and make cool. In the weak EAWM years, however, the situation is totally on the opposite. Finally, the effects of strong/weak EAWM on the distribution of aerosols in East Asia are discussed. It is found that the northerly wind strengthens (weakens) and transports more (less) aerosols southward in strong (weak) EAWM years, resulting in higher (lower) AOD in the north and lower (higher) AOD in the south. The long-term weakening trend of EAWM may potentially increase the aerosol loading. Apart from the changes in aerosol emissions, the weakening of EAWM should be another cause that results in the increase of AOD over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region and SCB but the decrease of AOD over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. Using the Regional Climate-Chemistry coupled Model System (RegCCMS), we further prove that the intensity of EAWM has great impacts on the spatial distribution of aerosols. In strong (weak) EAWM years, there is a negative (positive) anomaly in the air column content of aerosol, with a reduction (increment) of \u221280 (25)  mg  m \u22122 . The change pattern of aerosol concentrations in lower troposphere is different from that at 500  hPa, which is related with the different change pattern of meteorological fields in EAWM circulation at different altitude. More obvious changes occur in lower atmosphere, the change pattern of aerosol column content in different EAWM years is mainly decided by the change of aerosols in lower troposphere.",

        "abstract": "The aerosol optical and physical properties as well as its direct radiative forcing (DRF) in urban area of Nanjing (urNJ) are investigated, based on the measurements of Cimel sun-photometer combined with a radiation transfer model. We find that the annual mean 550\u2009nm aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the total aerosols is about 0.65, dominated by scattering aerosols (about 94\u2009%), resulting in a mean single scattering albedo (SSA) of 0.93 at 550\u2009nm and refractive index of 1.44\u2009+\u20090.0084i at 440\u2009nm during the sampling period. The scattering aerosol has larger size than the absorbing aerosol, with Angstrom exponents (AE) of 1.19 at 440/870\u2009nm, 0.13 smaller than the latter one. The coarse mode fraction for the scattering aerosol (18.03\u2009%) is much smaller than the absorbing aerosolu0027s (43.91\u2009%). Thus, the fine mode aerosols presents more scattering (SSA\u2009=\u20090.95) while the coarse aerosol is more absorption (SSA\u2009=\u20090.82). Analysis implies that there are about 15\u2009% and 27.5\u2009% occurrences of dust and black carbon dominated mixing aerosols, respectively, during the sampling period. All the optical properties follow a simple unimodal pattern. Aerosols in urNJ have a two-mode lognormal pattern in volume size distribution, peaking at the radius of 0.148 and 2.94\u2009\u00b5m, and the AOD positively depends on them. Although the fine mode aerosol has a much smaller sizes than the coarse one, they have the same level of the volume concentrations (about 0.12\u2009\u00b5m 3 /cm 3 ) due to much higher fraction of the fine aerosol. Estimations present that the mean aerosol DRFs at the top of atmosphere (TOA) are \u221210.69, \u221216.45, p5.76\u2009W/m 2 , respectively, for the total, scattering and absorbing aerosols in clear sky. At the surface, the DRFs are 1.1\u20132.5 times stronger than those at TOA, and the fine aerosol DRFs in these three type of aerosols account for 83.7\u2009%, 91.7\u2009% and 67.2\u2009%, respectively, to their totals. Normally, aerosol DRFs is not very sensitive (no more than 5\u2009%) to its profiles in clear sky condition (extreme cases excepted), although both aerosol scattering and absorption could become weaker to some extent if more aerosols were in lower layers. Both the aerosol properties and DRFs have substantial seasonality.",

        "abstract": "The optical and physical properties as well as the direct radiative forcings (DRFs) of fractionated aerosols in the urban area of the western Yangtze River Delta (YRD) are investigated with measurements from a Cimel sun photometer combined with a radiation transfer model. Ground-based observations of aerosols have much higher temporal resolutions than satellite retrievals. An initial analysis reveals the characteristics of the optical properties of different types of fractionated aerosols in the western YRD. The total aerosols, mostly composed of scattering components (93.8\u202f%), have mean optical depths of 0.65 at 550\u202fnm and refractive index of 1.44\u202f+\u202f0.0084 i  at 440\u202fnm. The fine aerosols are approximately four times more abundant and have very different compositions from coarse aerosols. The absorbing components account for only \u2009\u223c\u2009\u202f4.6\u202f% of fine aerosols and 15.5\u202f% of coarse aerosols and have smaller sizes than the scattering aerosols within the same mode. Therefore, fine particles have stronger scattering than coarse ones, simultaneously reflecting the different size distributions between the absorbing and scattering aerosols. The relationships among the optical properties quantify the aerosol mixing and imply that approximately 15 and 27.5\u202f% of the total occurrences result in dust- and black-carbon-dominating mixing aerosols, respectively, in the western YRD. Unlike the optical properties, the size distributions of aerosols in the western YRD are similar to those found at other sites over eastern China on a climatological scale, peaking at radii of 0.148 and 2.94\u202f\u00b5m. However, further analysis reveals that the coarse-dominated particles can also lead to severe haze pollution over the YRD. Observation-based estimations indicate that both fine and coarse aerosols in the western YRD exert negative DRFs, and this is especially true for fine aerosols (\u221211.17\u202fW\u202fm \u22122  at the top of atmosphere, TOA). A higher absorption fraction leads directly to the negative DRF being further offset for coarse aerosols (\u22120.33\u202fW\u202fm \u22122 ) at the TOA. Similarly, the coarse-mode DRF contributes to only 13.3\u202f% of the total scattering aerosols but u003e\u202f33.7\u202f% to the total absorbing aerosols. A sensitivity analysis states that aerosol DRFs are not highly sensitive to their profiles in clear-sky conditions. Most of the aerosol properties and DRFs have substantial seasonality in the western YRD. The results further reveal the contributions of each component of the different size particles to the total aerosol optical depths (AODs) and DRFs. Additionally, these results can be used to improve aerosol modelling performance and the modelling of aerosol effects in the eastern regions of China.",

        "abstract": "Chemical characteristics of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Wuxi at urban, industrial, and clean sites on haze and non-haze days were investigated over four seasons in 2016. In this study, high concentrations of fine particulate matter (107.6 \u00b1 25.3 \u03bcg/m3) were measured in haze episodes. The most abundant chemical components were organic matter (OM), SO42\u2212, NO3\u2212, elemental carbon (EC), and NH4+, which varied significantly on haze and non-haze days. The concentrations of OM and EC were 38.5 \u00b1 5.4 \u03bcg/m3 and 12.3 \u00b1 2.1 \u03bcg/m3 on haze days, which were more than four times greater than those on non-haze days. Source apportionment using a chemical mass balance (CMB) model showed that the dominant sources were secondary sulfate (17.7%), secondary organic aerosols (17.1%), and secondary nitrate (14.2%) during the entire sampling period. The source contribution estimates (SCEs) of most sources at clean sites were lower than at urban and industrial sites. Primary industrial emission sources, such as coal combustion and steel smelting, made larger contributions at industrial sites, while vehicle exhausts and cooking smoke showed higher contributions at urban sites. In addition, the SCEs of secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, and secondary organic aerosols on haze days were much higher than those on non-haze days, indicating that the secondary particulate matter formations process was the dominating reason for high concentrations of particles on haze days.",

To further understand the characteristics andinteractions among different urban air pollutants in the west Yangtze RiverDelta (YRD) region, continuous measurements of low-layer atmosphericparticles  trace gases have been performed at an urban site in Nanjingfrom September\u00a02016 to February\u00a02017 in this study. In the urban area of the westYRD, the mean PM  10     O 3   concentrations are86.3\u2009 \u00b5 g\u2009m  \u22123  and 37.7\u2009ppb, respectively, with significant seasonal  diurnalvariations. Particles, which are dominated by fine aerosols, are relativelyscattering. And most of their optical properties have similar variationsto the aerosol concentrations. Results also show that the west YRD could stillsuffer severe air pollution, although the seasonal mean aerosolconcentrations have decreased in recent years. Even in cold seasons, O 3   could exceed the National Ambient AirQuality Standards for about 40\u00a0days during the samplingperiod.Most of polluted episodes are caused by local  subregional emissions. A case study for a typical O 3    PM  2.5   episode in December\u00a02016 demonstrates that theepisode was generally associated with regional transport  a stable weathersystem. Air pollutants were mostly transported from the western areas withhigh emissions, as well as with an anticyclone  high-pressure system inthis region. Correlation analysis reveals that the interactions  O 3    PM are complex, with a combination of inhibition  promotionunder different conditions. The inhibition effect might result from thereduction of photolysis frequency near the surface due to aerosols in addition to theirpositive correlations with precursors, while the promotion effect is fromthe formation of secondary aerosols under high concentrations of oxidantsand solar radiation. However, the interaction between  O 3    BC showsan inhibiting effect due to its chemical stability. This also indicated aVOC-sensitive regime for photochemical production of  O 3   in thisregion. This study further improves insight into the characteristics andinteractions of main pollutants  may contribute tothe improvement of the simulation  prediction of aerosols  gases in the urban area ofthe YRD.",

        "abstract": "Agricultural biomass burning (ABB) has been of particular concern due to its influence on air quality and atmospheric radiation, as it produces large amounts of gaseous and aerosol emissions. This paper presents an integrated observation of a significant ABB episode in Nanjing, China during early June 2011, using combined ground-based and satellite sensors (MODIS, AIRS, CALIPSO, and OMI products). The time-height distribution, optical properties, sources and transport of smoke, as well as its impacts on air quality are investigated. Lidar profiles indicate that the smoke aerosols are confined to the planetary-boundary-layer (PBL) and have a depolarization ratio of less than 0.08. The aerosol optical depths (AOD) increase from 0.5 to 3.0 at 500-nm while the extinction-related Angstrom exponent (EAE) increases from 1.1 to 1.6 at the wavelength pair of 440-870\u2009nm. The single-scattering-albedo (SSA) becomes lower at 670-1020\u2009nm following the ABB intrusion, and particularly shows a decreasing tendency between wavelengths of 440 to 1020\u2009nm. The absorption Angstrom exponent (0.7) is smaller than 1.0, which may indicate the aged smoke particles mixed or coated with the urban aerosols. Surface PM10 and PM2.5 show a dramatic increase, reaching hourly mean of 800\u2009\u00b5g/m3 and 485\u2009\u00b5g/m3, respectively, which results in a heavy air pollution event. The stagnant and high-moisture weather provides favorable conditions for the aerosols to accumulate near the surface. CALIPSO observations also illustrate that the large-scale aerosols are primarily present in the PBL and transported to the ocean; but some dense smoke plumes are misclassified as cloud or polluted dust. By comparing with the observations, we found that the WRF-Chem model captured the accumulation and downwind transport of surface PM2.5 from 20:00 on June 2 to 10:00 on June 3 (Phase-1), but showed a dramatic underestimate from 20:00 on June 3 to 4 June (Phase-2) when dense aerosols are present. Such a discrepancy in the model is associated with the improper vertical apportion of transported smoke and atmospheric diffusion conditions when comparing with the observed aerosol and wind profiles. In addition, the model simulations indicate that the transported smoke can contribute to 50-70% of the ground-level PM2.5 in Nanjing.",

The Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) metropolitan area in northern China is frequently influenced by complex atmospheric thermal circulations due to its special topography and geographic position. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model combined with remote sensing is used to explore the urbanization impacts on local circulations in the BTH region. The urban heat island (UHI) effect generated around Beijing and Tianjin shows complex interactions with local thermal circulations. Due to the combined effects of UHI and topography, the UHI circulation around Beijing and valley breeze at the southern slopes of Yan Mountain are coupled together to reinforce each other. At the coastal cities, the increased land/sea temperature gradient considerably accelerates the sea breeze along Bohai Bay and moves the sea breeze front further inland to reach as far as Beijing. This study may lay a foundation for the better understanding of air pollutant dispersion on complex terrain.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Fine particle (PM 2.5 ) and ozone (O 3 ) are major air pollutants in China, especially in developed city clusters. A comprehensive field campaign, the Campaign on Air Pollution and Urban Meteorology in Yangtze River Delta (CAPUM-YRD), eastern China is carried out in 2016 to enhance the understanding of regional PM 2.5  and O 3  pollution. Two super sites in Shanghai, one in Hangzhou, as well as nineteen national monitoring stations in Nanjing and Hefei jointly participate in the campaign. In this study, regional PM 2.5  and O 3  pollution episodes are characterized based on summer and winter experiments during the CAPUM-YRD. Further, trajectory simulation and source apportionment technology in Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) are applied to explore the source of the pollution episodes. We find that regional synchronous PM 2.5  pollution episodes (over 120\u202f\u03bcg/m 3 ) occur frequently in YRD. Secondary inorganic and carbonaceous components account for a major proportion (70\u201380%) in PM 2.5 . Nitrate concentration is significantly higher (lower) than sulfate in winter (summer). The secondary conversion of sulfur and nitrogen increases alongside elevated PM 2.5  levels, with a maximum ratio of 0.28 and 0.18 in winter, respectively. Source apportionment results suggest that the contribution of emissions within YRD dominates in PM 2.5  (over 60%) compared to other regions. The inter-regional transport from the north-northwest in eastern China can contribute over 20% to PM 2.5  in YRD, with a maximum of 28.4% in Nanjing. Under the transport by enhanced northerly winds, PM 2.5  concentrations may increase explosively, with observed peak values in Hefei (312.6\u202f\u03bcg/m 3 ) and Nanjing (255.7\u202f\u03bcg/m 3 ). Moreover, high levels and remarkable spatial heterogeneity of O 3  are observed over YRD in summer, with daily maximum 8-h average O 3  above 300\u202f\u03bcg/m 3  in Nanjing. The occurrence of O 3  pollution episodes is significantly impacted by favorable weather conditions and transport at multiple spatial scales. Regional contribution results demonstrate that super-regional transport is prominent (29.4\u201350.7%) in O 3  pollution, especially in coastal cities like Shanghai (30.3\u201363.0%). Our results suggest that enhanced regional collaboration and efforts are of extreme necessity in long-term and optimized control of severe PM 2.5  and O 3  pollution in YRD.",

The results show that with the increase of sludge content, the compressive strength of the sludge tile decreases rapidly and the flexural strength increases slightly. Decrease of the sludge particle size can enhance the overall strength of the tile, and the sandwich complex structure can enhance the compressive strength of the tile. Furthermore, it is found that the sludge tiles had better abrasion resistance than common gray bricks but worse abrasion resistance than retail tiles. The water leached from the sludge tiles is almost non corrosive, and sludge containing the heavy metals Cu and Mn are well sealed up in the tiles and do not leach out.",

As to the transformation in education model, the German Dual System is considered as the major reference to our education transformation. However, it is not applicable for us to conduct education practice in two parts with theoretical teaching in school and on spot training in business. Therefore it is our first option to adopt training in simulated business organization as a transition.

        "title": "Targeting HMGB1-mediated autophagy as a novel therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma.",
        "abstract": "Autophagy is a catabolic process critical to maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cytotoxic insult. Autophagy is recognized as \"programmed cell survival\" in contrast to apoptosis or programmed cell death. Upregulation of autophagy has been observed in many types of cancers and has been demonstrated to both promote and inhibit antitumor drug resistance depending to a large extent on the nature and duration of the treatment-induced metabolic stress as well as the tumor type. Cisplatin, doxorubicin and methotrexate are commonly used anticancer drugs in osteosarcoma, the most common form of childhood and adolescent cancer. Our recent study demonstrated that high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1)-mediated autophagy is a significant contributor to drug resistance in osteosarcoma cells. Inhibition of both HMGB1 and autophagy increase the drug sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the ULK1-FIP200 complex is required for the interaction between HMGB1 and BECN1, which then promotes BECN1-PtdIns3KC3 complex formation during autophagy. Thus, these findings provide a novel mechanism of osteosarcoma resistance to therapy facilitated by HMGB1-mediated autophagy and provide a new target for the control of drug-resistant osteosarcoma patients.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the immunoregulatory function of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on allogeneic B lymphocytes in vitro, and explore its possible mechanisms.Human MSCs were isolated from bone marrow and expanded in vitro. The purity of MSCs were identified with the spindle fibroblastic morphology by micro-photograph and the phenotype by flow cytometry. MSCs were irradiated with 20 Gy of gamma ray to abolish proliferative capacity. The change of activated B cells proliferative capability and apoptosis with or without MSCs were examined. The effect of MSCs on activated B cells proliferation was compared between transwell cultures and non-transwell cultures. The IgG, IgA and IgM productions of B cells and the immune molecules expression with or without MSCs were assessed. RESULTS (1) MSCs could not induce the proliferation of B lymphocytes, but could suppress LPS activated B lymphocytes proliferation. (2) With the number of MSCs increased, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed in B cell proliferation. MSCs could not induce B cells apoptosis. The activated B cells proliferation with MSCs in transwell culture was decreased, suggesting that MSCs inhibition of B cells might be mediated both by cell-to-cell contact and soluble factors. (3) MSCs suppressed the IgG, IgA and IgM production of B cells, but not suppressed the immune molecules HLA-DR, CD40, CD80 and CD86 expression.Bone marrow MSCs can suppress allogeneic B lymphocytes proliferation and its secretion in vitro.",

        "title": "Time window choice for bone marrow stromal cells transplantation in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in neonatal rats",
        "abstract": "Aim: Many researches have shown that transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can reduce hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD), but the therapeutic window is unknown. This study is designed to conduct BMSCs transplantation on neonate rats following HIBD at different time points, and investigate the optimal therapeutic time window by assessment of long-lasting ethology and histology. Methods: This study was completed in the Central Laboratory of Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from June 2005 to June 2006. 1 Animals: Fifty 7-day-old SD rats of cleaning grade were divided into 5 groups at random: normal control group, model control group, 24-hour, 72-hour, 7-day transplantation groups (n=10). Another 10 4-week-old SD rats were prepared for culture of BMSCs. The rat treatments followed the animal ethics standard. 2 Experimental methods: Except the normal control group, the rats of other four groups were use to establish HIBD model. By means of stereotaxis instrument, 1 \u00d7 105 BMSCs (2 \u03bc L) of passage 3 stained with Hochest33324 for 24 hours were transplanted into the left hippocampus at 24 hours, 72 hours and 7 day after induction of HIBD in the corresponding groups.3 Experimental assessment: Radial arm maze test was performed at 40 days, and the time taken to visit the 3 baited arms, number of error and number of repetition were recorded. After ethology test, Nissl staining of brain sections was used to count the neurons of CA1 area in the left hippocampus. The survival and proliferation of BMSCs were observed under fluorescence microscope, and immunofluorescence was used to identify the expressions of neuron specific encolase (NSE) of the transplanted BMSCs. Results: All of 50 rats were involved in the result analysis.1 Radial arm maze test: The time taken to visit the 3 baited arms, number of error and number of repetition in the model control group were higher than that of other groups (P < 0.01), and the rats of 24-hour transplantation group had lower results than those in the 72-hour and 7-day transplantation groups (P < 0.05). 2 Neurons of CA1 area in the left hippocampus in the model control group disordered and lost obviously, being significantly decreased compared with the normal control group (P < 0.01). The neurons arranged orderly in the transplantation groups, and were significantly increased compared with the model control group (P < 0.01). The neuron of CA1 in the left hippocampus of 24-hour transplantation group was more than that in the other two transplantation groups (P < 0.05).3 Proliferation and neural differentiation of the transplanted BMSCs: BMSCs survived and proliferated in the transplanted site and left cortex at 30-40 days after transplantation, and the NSE expression rate of BMSCs in the left hemisphere in the 24-hour transplantation group was remarkably higher than those in the 72-hour and 7-day transplantation groups (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Transplantation of BMSCs in neonate rats at 24 hours after HIBD has the maximal long-lasting ethological improvement, which is induced by brain damage, and the mechanism may be that early transplantation with BMSCs reduces effectively neuron necrosis and apoptosis, and is helpful for the migration and differentiation of BMSCs.",

Methods Using the micro-osmomter (the AdvancedTM MICRO-OS-MOMETER, Model 3300) to assay serum osmolality, and electrolyte in 54 neonates with brain edema on the 1 st,3 rd and 7 th day. Eleven normal neonataes were chosen to be as control Results The serum osmolality of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) neonate and asphyxiated neonae was lower than normal value remarkably on the 1 st and 3 rd day, and resumed on the 7 th day. The serum osmolality of neonate with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was higher than normal value on the 1 st and 3 rd day, and it was normal on the 7 th day. The serum osmolality of neonates with respiratory distress and/or sever pneumonia were lower than normal value significantly on the 1 st and 3 rd day, and kept lower persistently on the 7th day. The ICH of newborn presented hypernatremia and the other diseases presented hyponatremia in the early days while on the 7 th day all were resumed. Conclusions The serum osmolality in neonates with brain edema is changed with pathogenesis and age. Mornitoring the serum osmolality may be helpful for the assessment of the severity and the clinical treatment of neonatal brain edema.",

Recent studies indicate that HMGB1 plays an important role in leukemia pathogenesis and chemotherapy resistance. Serum HMGB1 is increased in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia as compared to healthy control and complete remission groups. Moreover, HMGB1 is a negative regulator of apoptosis in leukemia cells through regulation of Bcl-2 expression and caspase-3 activity. As a positive regulator of autophagy, intracellular HMGB1 interacts with Beclin 1 in leukemia cells leading to autophagosome formation. Additionally, exogenous HMGB1 directly induces autophagy and cell survival in leukemia cells. Experimental strategies that selectively target HMGB1 effectively reverse and prevent chemotherapy resistance in leukemia cells, suggesting that HMGB1 is a novel therapeutic target in leukemia.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the primary causes of suboptimal outcomes in chemotherapy of children with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). The mechanisms of drug transport resistance may chiefly contribute to MDR. Expression and/or activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multiple resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP1), lung-resistance related protein (LRP) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) have been considered to be associated with unfavourable outcomes in pediatric AML patients. In previous studies, we found WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein-1 (WAVE1) was involved in the MDR mechanisms in K562/A02 leukemia cells. To investigate the expression of WAVE1, P-gp, MRP1, LRP/MVP and BCRP; and if WAVE1 is involved in MDR of human leukemia cell.WAVE1, P-gp, MRP1, LRP, BCRP mRNA and protein expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were measured by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) and Western blot in a cohort of 52 children with acute myeloblastic leukemia. During follow-up, of the 52 patients, 21 were documented as being relapsing or refractory, and 31 were induced into complete continuous remission. Furthermore, HL60 cells and HL60/ADR cells were transiently transfected with PCDNA3.1-WAVE1 reconstructed plasmid and specifically siRNA to WAVE1 respectively, and the expression of WAVE1, MRP1 and BCRP before and after transfection was assessed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis.(1) The expression levels of WAVE1, P-gp, MRP, LRP and BCRP in refractory/relapsing group were much higher than that in complete continuous remission (CCR) group. (2) WAVE1 mRNA and protein expression in BMMCs of children were at higher levels when they were newly diagnosed or relapsed, compared with complete continuous remission. (3) The WAVE1 expression at mRNA and protein level in HL60/ADR cells was increased by about 353% and 95% respectively as compared with that in HL60 cells. (4) Overexpression of WAVE1 in HL60 cell lines upregulated the expression levels of MRP and BCRP (MRP mRNA and protein level were increased by about 16.54 times and 129% respectively, BCRP was increased by 4.93 times and 96%); whereas suppression of WAVE1 expression by RNA interference downregulated the expression levels of MRP1 and BCRP (MRP mRNA and protein level was only 11% and 43% of pre-disturbance respectively, BCRP was 14% and 71%).Higher levels of WAVE1 in the BM indicate an unfavorable prognosis in children with AML. WAVE1 is related to the development of AML and involved in the MDR mechanisms, and regulates the level of MRP1 and BCRP.",

Since the rats were 40-day-old, they underwent radial maze water-seeking test and 4 sensorimotor tests. Then the brains of the rats were taken out to undergo histological examination by Nissl staining and immunohistochemistry to observer the 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) expression.The times the rats took to find the water in all 3 arms of the maze were arranged form short to long in the order HT group < VT group < CT group < HIBD group with significant differences between the HT, VT, and CT groups and HIBD group (All P < 0.05) and between the groups HT and VT and the group CT (both P < 0.05). The results of the 4 sensorimotor tests were arranged from the best to the worst in the order CT group > VT group > HT group > HIBD group with significant differences between the groups CT and VT and the group HIBD (both P < 0.05). Nissl staining showed that the number of normal neurons in the cortex area from more to less were arranged in the order CT group > VT group > HT group > HIBD group; and the number of normal neurons in the CAI area from more to less were arranged in the order HT group > VT group > CT group > HIBD group.Transplantation of NSC attenuates the brain damage and the cognitive and sensorimotor dysfunction after HIBD.

        "abstract": "MIR34A (microRNA 34a) is a tumor suppressor gene, but how it regulates chemotherapy response and resistance is not completely understood. Here, we show that the microRNA MIR34A-dependent high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) downregulation inhibits autophagy and enhances chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in the retinoblastoma cell. HMGB1 is a multifaceted protein with a key role in autophagy, a self-degradative, homeostatic process with a context-specific role in cancer. MIR34A inhibits HMGB1 expression through a direct MIR34A-binding site within the HMGB1 3' untranslated region. MIR34A inhibition of HMGB1 leads to a decrease in autophagy under starvation conditions or chemotherapy treatment. Inhibition of autophagy promotes oxidative injury and DNA damage and increases subsequent CASP3 activity, CASP3 cleavage, and PARP1 [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1] cleavage, which are important to the apoptotic process. Finally, upregulation of MIR34A, knockdown of HMGB1, or inhibition of autophagy (e.g., knockdown of ATG5 and BECN1) restores chemosensitivity and enhances tumor cell death in the retinoblastoma cell. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms governing the regulation of HMGB1 expression by microRNA and their possible contribution to autophagy and drug resistance.",

The frequency of LOH on 6q16.3\uff5e21 was32%. A 2-cM high frequency deletion region was flanked by D6S1709 and D6S301 loci at 6q16.3\uff5e21. Clinicaldata showed that patient with 6q16.3\uff5e21 LOH had higher WBC counts and blast cells (P < 0.05). The statisticsabout age, sex, classification of morphology and immunology were indistinct (P > 0.05). Then, positional cloningstrategy, bioinformatics technology and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used toidentify candidate TSGs and its cDNA fragments at 6q16.3\uff5e21, especially at the high frequency deletion region.Comparing with expression of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cell, EST screened in D6S1709-D6S301(GenBank Accession No.AA403058) was down-regulation in ten of fifteen childhood ALL (P < 0.05). Digitaldifferential display showed that the expression levels of AMD1, PPIL6 and WASF1 were lower in cancer tissuesthan in normal tissues(P < 0.05). These findings may provide new clues in cloning of childhood ALL TSGs at6q16.3\uff5e21.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of brain tissue extracts in neonate rats with hypoxic - ischemic brain damage (HIBD) on the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) into neural cells. Methods Fifteen 7-day-old neonate rats were induced HIBD by left carotid artery ligation and hypoxia exposure, and another 15-day-old neonate rats were served as normal rats. The left and right brain tissue extracts of the normal and HIBD rats were prepared 24 h after the HIBD (8-day old), 72 h after the HIBD (10-day old), and 7 d after the HIBD (14-day old), respectively (n = 5). The rat BMSCs of passage 3-5 were cultured in the medium with or without previous brain tissue extracts. The expressions of neuron specific encolase (NSE), glial fibrillary a-cidic protein ( GFAP) and O4 marked oligodendrocyte were detected after 3 days by immunocytochemistry. Results The expressions of NSE, GFAP and O4 of BMSCs cultured in the medium with left or right brain tissue extracts of different day old normal rats were higher than those of BMSCs cultured without the extracts, respectively (P < 0. 01), and the expressions of NSE, GFAP and O4 of BMSCs cultured in the medium with left brain tissue extracts of 8-day-old and 10-day-old HIBD rats were higher than those of BMSCs cultured with right brain tissue extracts of the same day HIBD rats and BMSCs cultured with left or right brain tissue extracts of the same day normal rats (P < 0. 01 or P < 0.05). The expressions of NSE, GFAP and O4 of BMSCs cultured in the medium with left brain tissue extracts of 8-day-old HIBD rats were higher than those of BMSCs cultured with left brain tissue extracts of 10-day-old and 14-day-old HIBD rats (P < 0. 01 or P < 0. 05). Conclusion The brain tissue extracts of normal and HIBD rats can induce BMSCS into neural cells, and the damaged brain tissue extracts of 8-day-old HIBD rats is the best inductor.",

        "abstract": "High mobility group box l (HMGB1), a nuclear DNA-binding protein, stabilizes the structure and function of chromatin, regulates gene transcription. Recent studies found that HMGB1 is associated with the proliferation and metastasis of many tumors, including breast cancer, colon carcinoma, and melanoma, and is rich in various solid cancer tissues and immature cells. This study was to explore the role of HMGB1 in adriamycin (ADM)-induced apoptosis in leukemia K562 cells.K562 cells were transiently transfected with recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-HMGB1. The expression of HMGB1 in K562 cells were detected by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) of ADM for K562 cells was determined by WST-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The protein level of Bcl-2 was detected by Western blot. The activities of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 were assayed with Caspase Colorimetric Assay Kit.The mRNA and protein levels of HMGB1 in K562 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-HMGB1 were increased by about 85% and 56% respectively as compared with those in K562 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1. Overexpression of HMGB1 in K562 cells by transient transfection significantly increased the resistance to ADM; the IC(50) of ADM was increased from (0.06+/-0.00) microg/mL to (3.46+/-0.06) microg/mL. When treated with 1 microg/mL ADM, the apoptosis rate was significantly lower in HMGB1-transfected K562 cells than in pcDNA3.1-transfected K562 cells [(12.00+/-1.26)% vs. (44.50+/-1.87)%, P<0.05]. Overexpression of HMGB1 in K562 cells significantly inhibited ADM-induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein. After treatment of ADM, the activities of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 in HMGB1-transfected K562 cells were inhibited as compared with those in pcDNA3.1-transfected K562 cells (Caspase-3: 1.55+/-0.06 vs. 2.55+/-0.06 at 12 h, 1.86+/-0.10 vs. 2.85+/-0.06 at 24 h, P<0.05; Caspase-9: 1.40+/-0.08 vs. 2.03+/-0.05 at 12 h, 1.55+/-0.06 vs. 2.22+/-0.05 at 24 h, P<0.05).HMGB1 overexpression could inhibit ADM-induced apoptosis in leukemia K562 cells through regulating the protein level of Bcl-2 and the activities of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9.",

Plasma activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was measured by the xanthine oxidase method. Plasma activity of GSH-Px was measured by the DTNB reaction test.The expression of WAVE1 and p22phox was significantly higher in the active ALL groups (newly diagnosed and relapse ALL) than that in the normal control and the complete remission (CR) ALL groups (<0.01). The CR ALL group showed increased WAVE1 and p22phox expression than those in the normal control group (<0.05). Plasma activities of SOD (22.62+/-7.39 U/mL) and GSH-Px (91.73+/-28.88 micromol/L) in the active ALL group were significantly lower than those in the normal control (166.35+/-27.93 U/mL and 490.94+/-39.38 micromol/L, respectively) and the CR ALL groups (107.11+/-28.57 U/mL and 267.56+/-82.64 micromol/L, respectively) (<0.01). WAVE1 expression was positively correlated with p22phox expression (r=0.34, <0.05) but negatively correlated with plasma activities of SOD and GSH-Px ( r=-0.336 and-0.408, respectively; <0.05).WAVE1 and p22phox expression in PBMCs increased and was associated with the disease course in children with ALL. Oxidative stress may be involved in the regulation of WAVE1 expression in ALL children.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests the important role of metabolic reprogramming in the regulation of the innate inflammatory response, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we provide evidence to support a novel role for the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)-mediated Warburg effect, namely aerobic glycolysis, in the regulation of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release. PKM2 interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) and activates the HIF-1\u03b1-dependent transcription of enzymes necessary for aerobic glycolysis in macrophages. Knockdown of PKM2, HIF1\u03b1 and glycolysis-related genes uniformly decreases lactate production and HMGB1 release. Similarly, a potential PKM2 inhibitor, shikonin, reduces serum lactate and HMGB1 levels, and protects mice from lethal endotoxemia and sepsis. Collectively, these findings shed light on a novel mechanism for metabolic control of inflammation by regulating HMGB1 release and highlight the importance of targeting aerobic glycolysis in the treatment of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) results from a blockade of granulocyte differentiation during the promyelocytic stage. As a fusion protein of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and retinoic acid receptor-\u03b1 (RAR\u03b1), PML-RAR\u03b1 oncoprotein is degraded through the differentiation of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced cells. Here reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were proven essential for the differentiation of APL cells. A down-regulation of ROS by ROS quencher (NAC) blocked the differentiation of APL cell line NB4 while an over-expression of ROS by superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) RNA interference (RNAi) increased cell differentiation. HMGB1 was vital for the differentiation of ROS-mediated NB4 cells and its up-regulation promoted ATRA-induced autophagy and the degradation of PML-RAR\u03b1. Furthermore, ATRA treatment elevated the levels of ROS, enhanced autophagic flux and thereby promoted cytosolic translocation of HMGB1. HMGB1 regulated the interactions between ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein p62/SQSTM and PML-RAR\u03b1 so as to affect the degradation of PML-RAR\u03b1 during ATRA-induced autophagy. Also a depletion of p62/SQSTM1 expression inhibited HMGB1-mediated PML-RAR\u03b1 degradation and cell differentiation. The overall results suggested that HMGB1 is an essential regulator of ROS-induced cell differentiation. And it may become a potential drug target for therapeutic intervention of APL.",

BrdU/DCX, BrdU/beta-tubulin, BrdU/GFAP and BrdU/O4 immunofluorescence were examined by confocal microscopy in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the cortex 7, 14 and 28 days after HBO treatment.The BrdU(+)DCX(+) cells in the SVZ (84 +/- 21 cells/mm2) in the HBO group were significantly higher than those in the CON group (39 +/- 14 cells/mm2) (p<0.05) and the HIBD model group (68 +/- 17 cells/mm2) (p<0.05) 7 days after HBO treatment. Fourteen days after HBO treatment, the BrdU(+) DCX(+) cells decreased in the SVZ and more cells were observed in the cortex in the HBO group as compared with the CON group (p<0.01). The BrdU(+) beta-tubulin(+), BrdU(+)GFAP(+) and BrdU(+) O4(+) cells were observed in the cortex, and more BrdU(+)beta-tubulin(+) and BrdU(+) O4(+) cells were observed in the HBO group as compared with the CON and the HIBD model groups (p<0.05) 28 days after HBO treatment.HBO treatment may promote endogenous NSCs to migrate to the cortex and differentiate into mature neurocytes in neonatal rats with HIBD.",

        "abstract": "Chemoresistance has become a major obstacle to the successful treatment of leukemia. Autophagy, a regulated process of degradation and recycling of cellular constituents, has recently caught increasing attention for its roles in conferring resistance to various commonly used anticancer therapies. Here we showed that the member of the S100 calcium-binding protein family, S100A8, is a critical regulator of chemoresistance in the autophagy process. It positively correlated with the clinical status in childhood acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and it was released from leukemia cells after chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. Knockdown of S100A8 expression increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapy and apoptosis. Moreover, suppressing S100A8 expression decreased autophagy as evaluated by the increased expression of the autophagic marker microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II, degradation of SQSTM1/Sequestosome 1 (p62) and formation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, stimuli that enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoted cytosolic translocation of S100A8 and thereby enhanced autophagy. S100A8 directly interacted with the autophagy protein Beclin1 displacing Bcl-2. These results suggest that S100A8 is a critical pro-autophagic protein that enhances cell survival and regulates chemoresistance in leukemia cells likely through disassociating the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex.",

Hoechst33258 staining was used to examine cell morphological changes and to calculate percentage of apoptotic nuclei. The mRNA level of mdrl was assayed by RT-PCR. The Bcl-2 protein was assayed by Western blot.1. The WAVE1 expression at mRNA and protein level in K562/A02 cells was increased by about 70% and 63% respectively as compared with that in K562 cells. 2. Overexpression of WAVE1 in K562 cells by transient transfection significantly increased the resistance to doxorubicin, and increased IC50 from (0.05 +/- 0.00) microg/ml to (2.99 +/- 0.12) microg/ml, and at 1 microg/ml or 5 microg/ml of doxorubicin treatment, cell apoptotic nuclei rate was decreased by 30% or 35% respectively. 3. Suppression of WAVE1 in K562/A02 cells by siRNA resulted in a reversal of MDR to doxorubicin, and decreased IC50 from (4.29 +/- 0.15) microg/ml to (1.85 +/- 0.07) microg/ml, and at 1 microg/ml or 5 microg/ml of doxorubicin treatment, cell apoptotic nuclei rate was increased by 24% or 21% respectively. 4.

        "abstract": "Both apoptosis (\"self-killing\") and autophagy (\"self-eating\") are evolutionarily conserved processes, and their crosstalk influences anticancer drug sensitivity and cell death. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1), normally a nuclear protein, is a crucial regulator of TNFSF10/TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor [ligand] superfamily, member 10)-induced cancer cell death. Activation of PARP1 (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1) was required for TNFSF10-induced ADP-ribosylation of HMGB1 in cancer cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 activity or knockdown of PARP1 gene expression significantly inhibited TNFSF10-induced HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation and subsequent HMGB1-BECN1 complex formation. Furthermore, suppression of the PARP1-HMGB1 pathway diminished autophagy, increased apoptosis, and enhanced the anticancer activity of TNFSF10 in vitro and in a subcutaneous tumor model. These results indicate that PARP1 acts as a prominent upstream regulator of HMGB1-mediated autophagy and maintains a homeostatic balance between apoptosis and autophagy, which provides new insight into the mechanism of TNFSF10 resistance.",

        "abstract": "Objective: A recent study has suggested that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy administered within 3 hrs following hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) may alleviate brain white matter damage (WMD) in neonatal rats. However it is unclear whether a delayed HBO therapy (more than 3 hrs following HIBD) has neuroprotective effects in neonatal rats. This study aimed to explore the effect of HBO therapy administered at different time points following HIBD on WMD in neonatal rats. Methods: The HIBD model was prepared according to the Rice-Vannucci procedure in 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. HBO therapy was administered at 3, 6, 12, 24 or 72 hrs after HIBD, once daily for consecutive 7 days. T-maze test, the foot-fault test and the radial arm maze test were performed after 14 days of HIBD. Myelin basic protein (MBP) in the callositas and corpora striata was examined by immunohistochemical method 28 days after HIBD. Results: The rats receiving HBO therapy at 3, 6 and 12 hrs after HIBD performed significantly better in the T-maze test, the radial arm maze test and the foot-fault test than the untreated HIBD rats. There were no significant differences in the behavioral test results between the HBO-treated groups administered HBO at 24 and 72 hrs after HIBD and the untreated HIBD group. The MBP expression in the HBO-treated groups treated within 12 hrs after HIBD was significantly higher than that in the untreated HIBD group (P < 0. 05). When the HBO therapeutic window was delayed to 24 hrs after HIBD, there were no significant differences in the MBP expression between the HBO-treated and the untreated HIBD groups. Conclusions: HBO therapy administered within 12 hrs following HIBD can alleviate brain WMD in neonatal rats, but the efficacy of HBO therapy administered 24 hrs after HIBD does not appear to be satisfactory.",

The HIBD and the HIBD+BMSCs transplantation group rats were subjected to left carotid artery ligation, followed by hypoxia exposure for 2 hrs, in order to induce HIBD. The rats in the HIBD+BMSCs transplantation group received transplantation of BMSCs labeled nucleus with Hochest 33324 into the left hippocampus 24 hrs after HIBD induction. Myelin basic protein (MBP) expression in the left corpus callosum and the subcortical white matter and the number of oligodendrocyte precursors positively stained O4 in the left periventricular area and the subcortical white matter were detected by immunohistochemistry at ages of 45 days.The labeled BMSCs survived and were found mainly in the left hemisphere 37 days after transplantation. The positive rate of O4 expressed by the transplanted BMSCs was 3.70+/-1.09%. More hypomyelination in the left corpus callosum and the subcortical white matter, and less number of O4 positive oligodendrocytes in the left periventricular area and the subcortical white matter were found in the HIBD group compared with the normal control group (P<0.01). The HIBD rats receiving BMSCs transplantation had increased O4 positive oligodendrocytes in the left periventricular area and the subcortical white matter and improved MBP immunoreactivity in the left corpus callosum and the subcortical white matter compared with the HIBD group (P<0.01).Intracerebral transplantation of BMSCs can improve brain white matter damage in neonatal rats with HIBD.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of high mobility group boxl (HMGBI) gene silence on adriamycin (ADM)-induced apoptosis in K562/A02 drug resistance leukemia cells.K562/ A02 cells were transient transfected with HMGB1- small interference RNA(siRNA) vector, and the levels of HMGB1 gene differential expression pre-and post-transfection were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of ADM on K562/A02 was determined by WST-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The release of Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm was assayed by Western blotting. Activity of Caspase-3 was assayed with a Caspase Colorimetric Assay Kit.(1) The HMGB1 expression at mRNA and protein levels in HMGB1 siRNA transfected K562/A02 cells were decreased by 86% and 71% respectively compared with control. (2) Suppression of HMGB1 by siRNA in K562/A02 cells resulted in a reversal of the resistance to ADM, and decreased IC50 from (4.83 +/- 0.08) microg/ml to (1.33 +/- 0.10) microg/ml. 1 microg/ml and 5 microg/ml of ADM treatment increased cell apoptotic rate by 27% and 32% respectively. (3) HMGB1 suppression in K562/A02 cells significantly promoted ADM- induced Smac/DIABLO release from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, and increased the activities of Caspase-3.HMGB1 gene silence can enhance sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to ADM and reverse cell resistant to ADM.",

        "title": "Relationship between p53 gene and chromosome 13q14 variations and prognosis in primary intestinal lymphoma",
        "abstract": "Objective: Some research has shown that primary intestinal lymphoma with the same immunophenotype has different prognosis. It suggests that the prognosis of this disease is not determined by a single factor but may be related to genetic or chromosomal variations. The p53 gene is an important tumor suppressor gene, and 13q14 deletion is a common chromosomal abnormality of lymphocyte proliferation diseases. This study aimed to explore the role of the p53 gene and chromosome 13q14 variations in the assessment of prognosis in primary intestinal lymphoma. Methods: p53 gene and chromosome 13q14 expression in paraffin sections of 30 cases of primary intestinal lymphoma and 10 cases of lymph node reactive hyperplasia were ascertained using an improved FISH technique. Results: p53 gene deletion was found in 22.7% of patients with primary intestinal lymphoma at stage I-II and in 75.0% of patients at stage III-IV (\u03c72 = 6.903, P < 0.01). The 30 patients with primary intestinal lymphoma were pathologically classified into mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) (n = 14) and non-MALT types (n = 16). The MALT lymphoma group had significantly lower incidence of p53 gene deletion (14.3% vs 56.3% \u03c72 = 5.662, P < 0.05). Average survival time in patients with p53 gene deletion was 13.41 months, being shorter than the patients with normal p53 gene (36.1 months) (t = 2.637, P < 0.05). 13q14 deletion was found in 40.0% of patients with primary intestinal lymphoma, but none of patients with lymph node reactive hyperplasia showed 13q14 deletion. 13q14 deletion was not significantly related to the pathological type and the clinical stage of primary intestinal lymphoma as well as the survival time. There was no significant correlation between p53 gene and 13q14 deletions. Conclusions: There was a high incidence of p53 gene deletion in patients with non-MALT lymphoma or at stage III-IV. p53 gene deletion is related to a high tumor malignant degree and a poor prognosis, while chromosome 13q14 variation is not associated with the prognosis in patients with primary intestinal lymphoma.",

After being purified, AEC II was randomly divided to 4 groups: air group (Air), hyperoxia group (HO), air plus hepatocyte growth factor group (Air+HGF), hyperoxia plus hepatocyte growth factor group (HO+HGF) . The mRNA levels of surfactant associated protein, SPs (including SPA, SPB, SPC) were measured by RT-PCR. The proliferation and apoptosis of AEC II were analyzed with flow cytometric assay and Western blot.(1) Compared with Air group, the apoptosis rate increased significantly in the HO group, while G(2)/M phase percentage and the protein expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased significantly (P<0.01); the S phase percentage and the protein expression levels of PCNA increased significantly in the Air+HGF group. (2) In the HO +HGF group, the apoptosis rate was not significantly different, G0/G1 phase percentage decreased significantly, S phase, G(2)/M phase percentage and the protein expression levels of PCNA increased significantly compared with the HO group. (3) SPs mRNA levels significantly decreased in the HO group compared with those in the Air group. After HGF was added, SPs mRNA levels increased in the HO +HGF group and the Air+HGF group compared with the HO group.Hyperoxia can inhibit the proliferation, increase the apoptosis rate and decrease SPs mRNAs levels of AEC II in vitro in premature rats, while HGF can partly inhibit the changes of SPs mRNAs levels and cell proliferation of AEC II resulted from hyperoxia, and HGF may play a protective role in hyperoxia-induced lung injury.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Previous studies that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment promotes the proliferation of neurocytes in neonatal rats following hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD). The Wnt signaling pathway is associated with neurogenesis. This study examined whether HBO promoted neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation after HIBD, and whether that the proliferation correlated with Wnt-3 protein expression. Methods: Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: normal control, hypoxia-ischemia (HI), and HI-HBO. HI was induced by the ligation of left common carotid artery, followed by a 2-hr exposure to 8% O2 in the latter two groups. HBO was administered 3 hrs after HI in the HI-HBO group for continuous 7 days (2 atmospheres absolute, once daily). The proliferating NSCs in the subventricular zone (SVZ) was examined by BrdU/nestin immunofluorescence and the expression of Wnt-3 protein in NSCs was examined by nestin/Wnt-3 immunofluorescence at 6 and 24 hrs and at 3, 7 and 14 days of HI. The cellular expressions of nestin and Wnt-3 protein were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. The linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between cellular Wnt-3 and nestin protein. The expressions of nestin and Wnt-3 protein in the ischemic cerebral hemisphere were analyzed with Western blotting. Results: The number of BrdU/nestin positive cells in the SVZ increased 3 hrs after HBO therapy, peaked at 7 days and remained at a higher level until 14 days after HBO therapy in the HI-HBO group compared with the normal control and the HIBD groups. The level of Wnt-3 protein in NSCs increased significantly 3 hrs after HBO therapy, peaked at 3 days and remained at high levels until 14 days after HBO therapy in the HI-HBO group compared with the normal control and the HIBD groups. The level of cellular nestin protein was closely correlated with the level of cellular Wnt-3 protein (r = 0.893, P < 0.05). The Western blotting analysis demonstrated increased Wnt-3 and nestin protein expressions in the ischemic cerebral hemispheres. Conclusions: HBO treatment promotes the proliferation of NSCs in HIBD neonatal rats, which is correlated with the activation of Wnt signaling.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study whether neurocytes which were induced from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can suppress allogenic T lymphocyte proliferation, and explore its possible mechanisms. Methods Human MSCs were isolated from bone marrow, and cultured and induced to differentiate into neurocytes for 1~2 weeks. According to the differentiation time, MSCs were divided into 3 groups: undifferentiated group, 1-week differentiated group and 2-week differentiated group. The cells at 1\u00d7104/well were co-cultured with allogenic T lymphocytes for 6 d. T lymphocyte proliferation was assessed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation using a liquid scintillation counter. To study the effect of the cells of each group modulated non-specific T lymphocyte proliferation, PHA (2 \u03bcg/mL) were added into coculture medium as a stimulate factor before the cells of each group were added. To simulate the inflammation environment in vivo, befor coculture with T lymphocytes, the cells of each group were pretreated by \u03b3-IFN for 48 h. Results Neurocytes from MSCs could suppress the proliferation of allogenic T lymphocytes, including PHA-stimulated non-specific T lymphocytes. Pretreated by \u03b3-IFN, the cells had a stronger ability of inhibiting the T lymphocyte proliferation. The proliferation-inhibiting effect was increased in a induced-differentiation time dependent manner. Conclusion Neurocytes from bone marrow MSCs can suppress the proliferation of allogenic T lymphocytes in vitro, which demonstrates that the immunity property of differented MSCs into neurocytes offers a new possibility in the development of cell therapies for neurological diseases.",

        "abstract": "Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) are cellularly derived molecules that can initiate and perpetuate immune responses following trauma, ischemia and other types of tissue damage in the absence of pathogenic infection. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a prototypical DAMP and is associated with the hallmarks of cancer. Recently we found that HMGB1 release after chemotherapy treatment is a critical regulator of autophagy and a potential drug target for therapeutic interventions in leukemia. Overexpression of HMGB1 by gene transfection rendered leukemia cells resistant to cell death; whereas depletion or inhibition of HMGB1 and autophagy by RNA interference or pharmacological inhibitors increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. HMGB1 release sustains autophagy as assessed by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation, redistribution of LC3 into cytoplasmic puncta, degradation of p62 and accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Moreover, these data suggest a role for HMGB1 in the regulation of autophagy through the PI3KC3-MEKERK: pathway, supporting the notion that HMGB1-induced autophagy promotes tumor resistance to chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the protective effects of adenovirus-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor (Ad-VEGF) 165 gene transfer against hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) in neonatal rats. Methods: Ad-VEGF recombinant adenovirus was constructed by bacterial homologous recombination technology. Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: sham-operated (n = 20), HIBD (n = 25), buffer-treated (n = 20), and Ad-VEGF-treated (n = 25). The HIBD model was prepared by permanent occlusion of left common carotid artery, followed by exposure to 8 % oxygen for 2 hrs. In the Ad-VEGF-treated and the Buffer-treated groups, 2 \u03bcL recombinant adenovirus suspension or buffer was injected into the left sensorimotor cortex of the rat brain 3 days after HIBD. Seven days after transplantation, VEGF165 mRNA expression was detected using RT-PCR. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated deoxyuridine triphosphate nickel end labeling (TUNEL). CD34 and VEGF protein were detected using immunohistochemistry. Microvascular density in the cerebral cortex was measured based on CD34 positive cells. A radial arm maze test was performed from 30 postnatal days to evaluate long-term learning and memory functions. At 35 postnatal days, the rats were sacrificed for cerebral histological examinations by hematoxylin and eosin. Results: The expression of VEGF165 mRNA increased in the Ad-VEGF-treated group more than in the untreated HIBD and the buffer-treated groups (P <0. 05). The number of apoptotic neurons was less in the Ad-VEGF-treated group compared with that in the untreated HIBD and the buffer-treated groups (P <0. 05). Microvascular density and VEGF positive cells increased in the Ad-VEGF-treated group compared with that in the untreated HIBD and the buffer-treated groups (P <0. 05). In the radial arm maze test, the Ad-VEGF-treated group had more improved achievements than the HIBD and the buffer groups (P <0. 05). Neuronal degeneration and necrosis were lessened in the Ad-VEGF-treated group compared with the HIBD and the buffer groups. Conclusions: Ad-VEGF gene transfer can increase the expression of VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein, decrease neuronal apoptosis, and increase angiopoiesis in the brain. This attenuates brain damage and improves long-term learning and memory functions in neonatal rats after HIBD.",

        "abstract": "Differentiation therapy based on all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is complicated by the development of differentiation syndrome (DS), which can be fatal. We examined the role of HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1) in DS using both in vitro and in vivo models. HMGB1 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were gradually released from NB4 and HL-60 cells treated with ATRA and/or ATO. Similarly, higher serum HMGB1 levels positively correlated with the clinical status of DS patients. Exogenous HMGB1 promoted rapid release of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 as well as elevated expression of ICAM-1, without altering cell differentiation. Exogenous HMGB1 also enhanced pulmonary infiltration and up-regulated ICAM-1 expression in the ATRA-treated DS mouse. Pharmacological inhibition or depletion of MEK1/2 reduced the cytokine levels and suppressed expression of ICAM-1 and the adhesion of HMGB1-treated NB4 cells to endothelial cells, implicating MEK/ERK signaling in the response to HMGB1 during DS. Treatment with a HMGB1-neutralizing antibody reduced secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, arrested the elevation of ICAM-1 and blunted the activation of ERK1/2 in ATRA-induced NB4 cells. The HMGB1-neutralizing antibody also decreased ICAM-1 expression and reduced mortality in ATRA-treated DS model mice. These findings demonstrate that released HMGB1 is central to DS, and that targeting HMGB1 may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of DS.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by pathogen infection and associated with pyroptosis. Pyroptosis occurs upon activation of proinflammatory caspases and their subsequent cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD), resulting in GSDMD N-terminal fragments that form membrane pores to induce cell lysis. Here, we show that antioxidant defense enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and its ability to decrease lipid peroxidation, negatively regulate macrophage pyroptosis, and septic lethality in mice. Conditional Gpx4 knockout in myeloid lineage cells increases lipid peroxidation-dependent caspase-11 activation and GSDMD cleavage. The resultant N-terminal GSDMD fragments then trigger macrophage pyroptotic cell death in a phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1)-dependent fashion. Administration of the antioxidant vitamin E that reduces lipid peroxidation, chemical inhibition of PLCG1, or genetic Caspase-11 deletion or Gsdmd inactivation prevents polymicrobial sepsis in Gpx4 mice. Collectively, this study suggests that lipid peroxidation drives GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and hence constitutes a potential therapeutic target for lethal infection.",

Although circadian clock disturbance impairs the early inflammatory response, its impact on post-septic immunosuppression remains poorly elucidated. Here, we show that Bmal1, a core circadian clock gene, plays a role in the regulation of host immune responses in experimental sepsis. Mechanistically, Bmal1 deficiency in macrophages increases PKM2 expression and lactate production, which is required for expression of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 in a STAT1-dependent manner. Consequently, targeted ablation of Pkm2 in myeloid cells or administration of anti-PD-L1-neutralizing antibody or supplementation with recombinant interleukin-7 (IL-7) facilitates microbial clearance, inhibits T\u00a0cell apoptosis, reduces multiple organ dysfunction, and reduces septic death in Bmal1-deficient mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that the circadian clock controls the immune checkpoint pathway in macrophages and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target for lethal infection.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis and septic shock remain challenging for intensive care units worldwide and have limited treatment options; therefore, identification of targetable key players in systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure is urgently needed. Here, we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a negative regulator of bioenergetic reprogramming in immune cells and suppresses sepsis development in vivo. Mechanistically, AMPK deficiency increases pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2)-dependent aerobic glycolysis, which leads to the release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1, a late mediator of lethal systemic inflammation) in macrophages and monocytes. Consequently, activation of AMPK by A-769662 protects whereas depletion of AMPK\u03b1 in myeloid cells promotes endotoxic shock and polymicrobial sepsis in mice. Additionally, administration of the PKM2 inhibitor shikonin reduces lactate production, HMGB1 release, and septic death in AMPK\u03b1-deficient mice. These findings suggest that disruption of the AMPK-dependent immunometabolism pathway may contribute to sepsis development and hence constitute a target for therapeutic intervention.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is characterized by dysregulated systemic inflammation with release of early (e.g., IL-1\u03b2) and late (e.g., HMGB1) proinflammatory mediators from macrophages. Plumbagin, a medicinal plant-derived naphthoquinone, has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity, but the underling mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that plumbagin inhibits the inflammatory response through interfering with the immunometabolism pathway in activated macrophages. Remarkably, plumbagin inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced aerobic glycolysis by downregulating the expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a protein kinase responsible for the final and rate-limiting reaction step of the glycolytic pathway. Moreover, the NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4)-mediated oxidative stress was required for LPS-induced PKM2 expression, because pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of NOX4 by plumbagin or RNA interference limited LPS-induced PKM2 expression, lactate production, and subsequent proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2 and HMGB1) release in macrophages. Finally, plumbagin protected mice from lethal endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture. These findings identify a new approach for inhibiting the NOX4/PKM2-dependent immunometabolism pathway in the treatment of sepsis and inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "Severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is responsible for significant human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, no specific treatments for AP exist, primarily due to the lack of a mechanistic understanding of sterile inflammation and the resultant multisystem organ dysfunction, the pathologic response of AP linked to early death. In this study, we demonstrate that the class III major histocompatibility region III receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) contributes to AP by modulating inflammasome activation in macrophages. RAGE mediated nucleosome-induced absent in melanoma 2 (but not NLRP3) inflammasome activation by modulating dsRNA-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation in macrophages. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the RAGE-dsRNA-dependent protein kinase pathway attenuated the release of inflammasome-dependent exosomal leaderless cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2 and high-mobility group box 1) in vitro. RAGE or absent in melanoma 2 depletion in mice limited tissue injury, reduced systemic inflammation, and protected against AP induced by l-arginine or cerulein in experimental animal models. These findings define a novel role for RAGE in the propagation of the innate immune response with activation of the nucleosome-mediated inflammasome and will help guide future development of therapeutic strategies to treat AP.",

One year ago the patient experienced a recurrent oral mucosal ulcer. Physical examination showed vitiligo in the skin of the upper right back. Routine blood tests and immune function tests performed in other hospitals had shown normal results. Multiple lung CT scans showed pulmonary infection. The patient had recurrent fever and cough and persistent presence of some lesions after anti-infective therapy. The antitubercular therapy was ineffective. Routine blood tests after admission showed agranulocytosis. Gene detection was performed and she was diagnosed with dyskeratosis congenita caused by homozygous mutation in RTEL1. Patients with dyskeratosis congenita with RTEL1 gene mutation tend to develop pulmonary complications. Since RTEL1 gene sequence is highly variable with many mutation sites and patterns and can be inherited via autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance, this disease often has various clinical manifestations, which may lead to missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. For children with unexplained recurrent pulmonary infection, examinations of the oral cavity, skin, and nails and toes should be taken and routine blood tests should be performed to exclude dyskeratosis congenita. There are no specific therapies for dyskeratosis congenita at present, and when bone marrow failure and pulmonary failure occur, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and lung transplantation are the only therapies. Androgen and its derivatives are effective in some patients. Drugs targeting the telomere may be promising for patients with dyskeratosis congenita.",

In the system, a high-power voltage regulator produces continuous adjustable voltage with a multifunction DAQ card, which is transformed into direct current high voltage by high voltage epoxy transformer and silicon diodes and so on. A high-speed I/O card makes the trigger system work according to timing. The master computer can accomplish real-time monitoring of DC high voltage, thyratron anode voltage, ground current and other devices in the driver via serial interface of RS-485, and the central host computer communicates with the control computer via Ethernet. The driver can work individually or harmonically with the central computer. LabVIEW is adopted as the development tool of the software system. Moreover, in order to decrease the influences of high voltage and intense current produced in high pulsed power experiments on operational site, reliability design is blent in the system hardware and software. The experimental results show that the system is an easily-manipulated, real-time system with user-friendly interface, performing reliably, and stably by rule and line, and it has good expansibility and portability in intelligent control for high-power microwave source driver.",

Static simulation results show that the highest operating field strength of the diode is 62 kV/cm under the empirical data 80 kV/cm; but the highest operating field strength of all the triple point is 46.3 kV/cm, higher than the empirical strength 30 kV/cm. The simulation results help to improve the initial design. And the highest operating field strength of all the triple point is 23.2 kV/cm, less than the empirical strength 30 kV/cm. So the design is feasible. The cubage of the tube is small and the high vacuum will be got very quickly. The tube can be demountable and can be used in narrow space far away the pulse forming line.",

Methods This series included 15 pregnant women (mean age,28 years,age range,23 -35 years) with renal colic that had not responded to conservative measures. Double-J-catheter was placed in them under local anesthesia between January 2000 and December 2004. The mean (range) gestation time was 20(8 -26) weeks at diagnosis. The greatest dimension of the calculi ranged from 3 to 15 mm. All of them presented with typical renal colic which could not be relieved by antispasmodics and analgesics. Results Renal colic was relieved by placing double-J-catheter under the cystoscope or ureteroscope in all 15 cases. Double-J-catheters slid out in 2 cases and were placed repeatedly. Three cases had mild discomfort in the lumbar and 1 had intermittent gross hematuria. No obstetric complications occurred. All the cases experienced full-term pregnancy. After delivery the stones were eliminated spontaneously in 6 cases. Laser lithotripsy with ureteroscope was performed in 6 cases and extracorpo-real shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in 3 cases. The retaining time of double-J catheter was 3-7 months ( mean,5 months). Conclusions For pregnant women whose renal colic cannot be alleviated by conservative methods,placing double-J-catheter is a safe and effective treatment choice.",

Methods Clinical data of 5 BPH patients with serum total PSA more than 60ng/ml was retrospectively summarized and analyzed under a review of some related literatures. Results The average level of serum PSA of all patients was obviously decreased after surgery and the average value of serum PSA was changed from 72.8ng/ml to 16.4ng/ml after 3 months. Level of serum PSA for a BPH patient with prostatitis was decreased from 103. 5ng/ml to 34.8ng/ml and serum PSA for another BPH patient with atypical hyperplasia from 84.6ng/ml to 42.6ng/ml. Average value of serum PSA was 11. 6ng/ml at 6 months after surgery. Conclution Age, prostate volume, urinary obstruction, urinary infection and prostatitis of patients were all positively correlated with high level of serum PSA except prostate cacinomar. For BPH patient with high serum PSA, early surgery was recommended in clinic.",

        "abstract": "[Objective] To compare the efficacy and safety of holmium laser combined with N-Trap and holmium laser alone in ureteroscopic lithotripsy for the treatment of upper ureteral stones.[Methods] 125 patients with upper ureteral stones in our center were retrospectively analyzed in this study,including 65 cases of single-use holmium laser and 60 cases of holmium 1aser combined with N-Trap.The operation time,the first success rate of lithotripsy,the rates of ureter perforation,the clearance of calculus in 4 weeks,and hospitalizing expenses were compared between two groups.[Results] There were 12 cases of upward calculus in Group A,and 2 cases of upward calculus in Group B.Patients treated with holmium 1aser combined with N-Trap showed longer operation time [(45\u00b117) min vs.(36\u00b112) min,P <0.05],with significantly higher success rate of lithotripsy in the first time [96.6%(58/60) vs.81.5%(53/65),P <0.05],higher clearance rate of calculus in 4 weeks [96.5% (56/58) vs.84.9% (45/53),P <0.05] and lower ureter perforation rate [3.3%(2/60) vs.15.3%(10/65),P <0.05],compared to those with single-use holmium laser.There were no statistical differences between two groups in median expenses of hospitalization [8613 $ vs.9182 $,P >0.05].[Conclusion] Appropriate fixation of the stones by N-Trap is the key to success.Holmium laser combined with NTrap for upper ureteral stones is characterized by higher efficacy and safety,lower incidence of residual fragments,lower reoperation rate and minimal invasion.This therapeutic method is worth recommending in clinical practice.",

The main factors that affect the hourly concentrations of NO 2 include O3 concentrations, NO concentrations, traffic volumes and meteorological factors which contain atmospheric temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, rainfall and solar radiation. The hourly average data of these affecting factors were selected as the input neurons of the network. And the network was trained and validated with the data form an automatic monitoring experiment on roadside. As a comparison, a multiple linear regression model was established. When predicting NO2 concentrations with the neural network approach, the mean absolute value of relative error of training and validation result was 7.19%, and the correlation coefficient between the predicted and monitored concentrations was 0.99, which was much better than the prediction with a multiple linear regression model.

        "abstract": "During the lifespan of large software systems, iterative development procedure is commonly adopted with continuously incremental software versions released to the market. When to release each release plays an important role for balancing the competition in market and the risk of low-quality software. Traditionally, release-time issue is addressed with software reliability models for single version. How to model the reliability of multi-release software development process is our concern now. It is interesting to study the dynamics of software faults during this releasing procedure. Without the loss of generality, a specific iterative software development scenario is considered for our current study, where a software development team develops, tests and releases software version by version. The trend of the remaining number of faults over different versions is of great concern, and a modeling framework is proposed to study the expected number of remaining faults in each version. Cost model is then proposed, and cost oriented optimal release time analysis for n versions is studied. A numerical example is given for the illustrative purpose. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "To accurately model software failure process with software reliability growth models, incorporating testing effort has shown to be important. In fact, testing effort allocation is also a difficult issue, and it directly affects the software release time when a reliability criteria has to be met. However, with an increasing number of parameters involved in these models, the uncertainty of parameters estimated from the failure data could greatly affect the decision. Hence, it is of importance to study the impact of these model parameters. In this paper, sensitivity of the software release time is investigated through various methods, including one-factor-at-a-time approach, design of experiments and global sensitivity analysis. It is shown that the results from the first two methods may not be accurate enough for the case of complex nonlinear model. Global sensitivity analysis performs better due to the consideration of the global parameter space. The limitations of different approaches are also discussed. Finally, to avoid further excessive adjustment of software release time, interval estimation is recommended for use and it can be obtained based on the results from global sensitivity analysis.",

        "abstract": "Context: Although reliability is a major concern of most open source projects, research on this problem has attracted attention only recently. In addition, the optimal version-dating for open source software considering its special properties is not yet discussed. Objective: In this paper, the reliability analysis and optimal version-updating for open source software are studied. Method: A modified non-homogeneous Poisson process model is developed for open source software reliability modeling and analysis. Based on this model, optimal version-updating for open source software is investigated as well. In the decision process, the rapid release strategy and the level of reliability are the two most important factors. However, they are essentially contradicting with each other. In order to consider these two conflicting factors simultaneously, a new decision model based on multi-attribute utility theory is proposed. Results: Our models are tested on the real world data sets from two famous open source projects: Apache and GNOME. It is found that traditional software reliability models provide overestimations of the reliability of open source software. In addition, the proposed decision model can help management to make a rational decision on the optimal version-updating for open source software. Conclusion: Empirical results reveal that the proposed model for open source software reliability can describe the failure process more accurately. Furthermore, it can be seen that the proposed decision model can assist management to appropriately determine the optimal version-update time for open source software.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT There are many real-life situations where exact failure times are not available or not easily available for reliability analysis. Motivated by this problem, this work is concerned with the analysis of reliability data without exact failure times. The unavailability of exact failure times has compelled us to develop a simplified version of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for reliability parameters and measures. The approach is applicable to singleparameter reliability models including the exponential reliability model and the Weibull reliability model with an assumed or known shape parameter value. In the latter case, it takes advantage of the fact that in many practical situations a reasonable estimate of the Weibull shape parameter is attainable by certain means. This is particularly valuable for reliability assessment of highly censored Weibull data with only a few failures, because in such situations it is highly desirable or necessary to exploit prior knowledge of the Weibull shape parameter to compensate for the limited information contained in the data in the hope of making a sound assessment. This is an application in a sense of the ideas and principles of the emerging paradigm of statistical engineering. The methods are developed by practitioners and for practitioners. We show that they offer practitioners a handy and efficient tool for reliability analysis, using hard disk drive product testing as examples. \u00a9 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, a cost-efficient control chart for monitoring product quality characteristic is designed using prior knowledge regarding the process distribution. In practice, however, the functional form of the underlying process distribution is rarely known a priori. Therefore, the nonparametric (distribution-free) charts have gained more attention in the recent years. These nonparametric schemes are statistically designed either with a fixed in-control average run length or a fixed false alarm rate. Robust and cost-efficient designs of nonparametric control charts especially when the true process location parameter is unknown are not adequately addressed in literature. For this purpose, we develop an economically designed nonparametric control chart for monitoring unknown location parameter. This work is based on the Wilcoxon rank sum (hereafter WRS) statistic. Some exact and approximate procedures for evaluation of the optimal design parameters are extensively discussed. Simulation results show that ov...",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe occurrence of an event, for example, some mishaps in manufacturing processes or natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, is often characterized by its frequency and magnitude. Procedures for simultaneously monitoring the event frequency and the event magnitude usually assume that the frequency and magnitude are two independent variables. However, the dependence between frequency and magnitude is very common in practice. In this paper, a bivariate gamma distribution is considered for modelling the event frequency and the magnitude with certain dependence structure. Based on this bivariate gamma distribution, a multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) procedure is designed for jointly monitoring the shifts in mean values of the frequency and the magnitude of an event. Some comparisons are carried out via Monte-Carlo simulations. The results show that our proposed MEWMA procedure has significant performance advantages in many situations for different shift domains.

This paper investigates the performance of different estimation procedures for a special type of interval-censored data, i.e. grouped data, from three widely used lifetime distributions. The approaches considered here include the maximum likelihood estimation, the minimum distance estimation based on chi-square criterion, the moment estimation based on imputation (IM) method and an ad hoc estimation procedure. Although IM-based techniques are extensively used recently, we show that this method is not always effective. It is found that the ad hoc estimation procedure is equivalent to the minimum distance estimation with another distance metric and more effective in the simulation. The procedures of different approaches are presented and their performances are investigated by Monte Carlo simulation for various combinations of sample sizes and parameter settings. The numerical results provide guidelines to analyse g...",

        "abstract": "Cost estimation is one of the most important but most difficult tasks in software project management. Many methods have been proposed for software cost estimation. Analogy Based Estimation (ABE), which is essentially a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach, is one popular technique. To improve the accuracy of ABE method, several studies have been focusing on the adjustments to the original solutions. However, most published adjustment mechanisms are based on linear forms and are restricted to numerical type of project features. On the other hand, software project datasets often exhibit non-normal characteristics with large proportions of categorical features. To explore the possibilities for a better adjustment mechanism, this paper proposes Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Non-linear adjustment to ABE (NABE) with the learning ability to approximate complex relationships and incorporating the categorical features. The proposed NABE is validated on four real world datasets and compared against the linear adjusted ABEs, CART, ANN and SWR. Subsequently, eight artificial datasets are generated for a systematic investigation on the relationship between model accuracies and dataset properties. The comparisons and analysis show that non-linear adjustment could generally extend ABE's flexibility on complex datasets with large number of categorical features and improve the accuracies of adjustment techniques.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators governing fundamental biological processes, and their disorder expression involves in the development of several human cancers. MIR31HG, an lncRNA located in 9p21.3 and 2166 bp in length, has been found to be upregulated in breast cancer and contributes to cell proliferation and invasion. However, the expression pattern and biological function of MIR31HG in gastric cancer are still not well documented. In this study, we found that MIR31HG expression is decreased in gastric cancer tissues and associated with larger tumor size and advanced pathological stage. Patients with lower MIR31HG expression had a relatively poor prognosis. Furthermore, ectopic over-expression of MIR31HG could inhibit gastric cancer (GC) cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, while knockdown of MIR31HG by small interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted cell proliferation in GC cells partly via regulating E2F1 and p21 expression. Our findings present that decreased MIR31HG is involved in GC development and could be identified as a poor prognostic biomarker in GC patients.",

In this study, we globally assessed the transcriptomic differences of lncRNAs in gastric cancer using publicly available microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and identified an oncogenetic lncRNA ZFAS1, which may promote gastric tumorigenesis. ZFAS1 has been found to be upregulated and function as oncogene in colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, but its expression pattern, biological function and underlying mechanism in gastric cancer is still undetermined. Here, we reported that ZFAS1 expression is also overexpressed in gastric cancer, and its increased level is associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival. Knockdown of ZFAS1 impaired gastric cancer cells proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro, and inhibited tumorigenicity of gastric cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistically, RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down experiment showed that ZFAS1 could simultaneously interact with EZH2 and LSD1/CoREST to repress underlying targets KLF2 and NKD2 transcription. In addition, rescue experiments determined that ZFAS1 oncogenic function is partly dependent on repressing KLF2 and NKD2. Taken together, our findings illuminate how ZFAS1 over-expression confers an oncogenic function in gastric cancer.",

        "abstract": "Multiple studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) extensively participate in human cancer malignant progression. The long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 707 (LINC00707), 3087 bp in length, was recently reported to be an essential oncogene in promoting lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and metastasis. However, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. In this study, we identified that LINC00707 was excessively expressed in GC tissues and correlated with advanced stage, larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis and poorer prognosis in GC patients. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that LINC00707 promote GC cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, LINC00707 could abundantly interact with mRNA stabilizing protein HuR; \"LINC00707-HuR\" coalition ulteriorly combined with VAV3/F11R mRNAs and increased their stability. Taken together, our findings prove that LINC00707 may act as an oncogene in GC by regulating mRNA stability and serve as a potential target for GC diagnosis and prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer death due to its poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Evidence indicates that pseudogene-derived long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be important players in human cancer progression, including GC. In this paper, we report that a newly discovered pseudogene-derived lncRNA named DUXAP8, a 2107-bp RNA, was remarkably upregulated in GC. Additionally, a higher level of DUXAP8 expression in GC was significantly associated with greater tumor size, advanced clinical stage, and lymphatic metastasis. Patients with a higher level of DUXAP8 expression had a relatively poor prognosis. Further experiments revealed that knockdown of DUXAP8 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration, as documented in the SGC7901 and BGC823 cell lines. Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that DUXAP8 could epigenetically suppress the expression of PLEKHO1 by binding to EZH2 and SUZ12 (two key components of PRC2), thus promoting GC development. Taken together, our findings suggest that the pseudogene-derived lncRNA DUXAP8 promotes the progression of GC and is a potential therapeutic target for GC intervention.",

        "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be an important class of functional regulators involved in human cancers development, including gastric cancer (GC). Here, we reported that HOXA cluster antisense RNA2 (HOXA-AS2), a 1048bp RNA, was upregulated in GC. Increased HOXA-AS2 expression in GC was associated with larger tumor size and higher clinical stage; patients with higher levels of HOXA-AS2 expression had a relatively poor prognosis. Further experiments revealed that HOXA-AS2 knockdown significantly inhibited GC cells proliferation by causing G1 arrest and promoting apoptosis, whereas HOXA-AS2 overexpression promoted cell growth. Furthermore, HOXA-AS2 could epigenetically repress the expression of P21, PLK3, and DDIT3 via binding with EZH2 (enhaner of zeste homolog 2), a key component of PRC2; ChIP assays demonstrated that EZH2 could directly bind to the promoter of P21, PLK3 and DDIT3, inducing H3K27 trimethylated. In conclusion, these data suggest that HOXA-AS2 could be an oncogene for GC partly through suppressing P21, PLK3, and DDIT3 expression; HOXA-AS2 may be served as a candidate prognostic biomarker and target for new therapies in human GC.",

        "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators in a variety of human diseases, including cancers. However, the biological function of these molecules and the mechanisms responsible for their alteration in gastric cancer (GC) are not fully understood. In this study, we found that lncRNA LINC00673 is significantly upregulated in gastric cancer. Knockdown of LINC00673 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion and induced cell apoptosis, whereas LINC00673 overexpression had the opposite effect. Online transcription factor binding site prediction analysis showed that there are SP1 binding sites in the LINC00673 promoter region. Next, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays provided evidence that SP1 could bind directly to the LINC00673 promoter region and activate its transcription. Moreover, mechanistic investigation showed that CADM4, KLF2, and LATS2 might be the underlying targets of LINC00673 in GC cells, and RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, and ChIP assays showed that LINC00673 can interact with EZH2 and LSD1, thereby repressing KLF2 and LATS2 expression. Taken together, these findings show that SP1-activated LINC00673 exerts an oncogenic function that promotes GC development and progression, at least in part, by functioning as a scaffold for LSD1 and EZH2 and repressing KLF2 and LATS2 expression.",

        "abstract": "Substantial evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in many biological mechanisms, and their dysregulation are also involved in the development and progression of cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). Long intergenic non-coding RNA 00324 (LINC00324), a 2115\u2009bp ncRNA, is located on chromosome 17p13.1. The biological function and molecular mechanisms of LINC00324 in GC remains undiscovered. In this paper, we found that the expression level of LINC00324 was significantly upregulated in GC tissues compared with the corresponding normal tissues. The overexpression of LINC00324 was correlated with advanced TNM stage, larger tumor size, and lymph node metastasis as well as poor prognosis. Further experiments revealed that knockdown of LINC00324 could suppress the proliferation of GC cells. RNA transcriptome sequencing technology revealed that FAM83B may be a significant downstream target gene of LINC00324. LINC00324 could combine with the RNA-binding protein (RBP) human antigen R (HuR) and thus stabilize the expression of FAM83B. Moreover, rescue assays showed that the reduced FAM83B expression partially reversed the promotion of cell growth in GC induced by the overexpression of LINC00324. In conclusion, our study revealed that LINC00324 acted as an oncogene in tumorigenesis and progression, suggesting that it could be a new biomarker in diagnosis and prognosis of GC.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to explore the effects of exogenous insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) on hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis of Schwann cells via neuritin-mediated pathway. Neuritin was identified with immunohistochemistry. Exogenous IGF1 was used to prevent possible changes in neuritin expression and apoptosis of Schwann cells isolated from rat sciatic nerves and cultured in high-glucose media. Neuritin silencing or overexpressing lentivirus transfection of Schwann cells was conducted. Expressions of neuritin at levels of transcription or translation were measured using quantitative PCR or Western blot. Caspase-3 and caspase-9 fluorometric assays were performed. Bcl-2 and Bax were assayed using Western blotting. Apoptosis of Schwann cells was measured using FACS analysis and TUNEL assay. A pathway of IGF1 action in relation to neuritin was explored. Neuritin and Bcl-2 protein were localized in Schwann cells of rats' sciatic nerves. In vitro, apoptosis increased with downregulated neuritin expression, which was prevented by exogenous IGF1 treatment in contrast to without, in Schwann cells isolated from rat sciatic nerve and cultured in high-glucose and serum-free media. A phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor treatment blocked the action of IGF1. The inhibitor did not affect the apoptosis rate that decreased obviously after neuritin was overexpressed in Schwann cells. The apoptosis rate increased drastically after neuritin was silenced, and the resultant apoptosis was suppressed by a caspase inhibitor treatment but not affected by exogenous IGF1. The activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 changed positively with apoptosis. An anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) not Bax increased or decreased in neuritin-overexpressed or neuritin-silenced Schwann cells, respectively. Bcl-2-selective inhibitor blocked the anti-apoptotic effect of neuritin. IGF1 or neuritin was not found to affect glucose levels in media during the experiment. The anti-apoptotic effect of IGF1 on Schwann cells inflicted by hyperglycemia is mediated at least by neuritin, a novel neurotrophic factor, through PI3K and Bcl-2.",

The complexity of the maritime transportation system is a prime obstacle in the evaluation of the operational reliability of the system; mainly due to the fact that statistical data on the important parameters and variables is scarce. This makes the application of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic a viable option to overcome the data problem with regards to imprecision or vagueness in parameters and variables values. In this paper, the different decisive factors, affecting maritime transportation systems, are modeled in the form of linguistic variables. Techniques such as aggregation, mapping of fuzzy sets using distance measure and fuzzy logic rule base are used to arrive at subjective operational reliability value. The complete procedure is demonstrated with an example.",

        "abstract": "Many service products are installed in a complex system that is operated only when the entire system is completed. The time from their installation to commissioning, called a dormant state in this article, may take several years for systems such as complete buildings or aircraft. Warranties for the products may cover the time starting from their installation to a certain time. Warranty cost on replacements for such products is different from normal products without any dormant state. This article analyses the replacement cost for nonrepairable services products from a manufacturer perspective. We consider four warranty policies, which include two types of warranty terms (i.e., nonrenewing or renewing) and two types of replacements (i.e., with preventive replacement or replacement only upon failures). Relationships between the failure patterns at the dormant state and at the operating state are also discussed. Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the methodology described in this article.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a probabilistic approach is presented for the evaluation of the reliability of piezoelectric micro-actuators that takes into account the effects of both driving voltage and temperature. Based on the relationships between the lifetime and degradation mechanism of piezoelectric actuators and the electric field strength, as well as the actuator working temperature, a two-dimensional probability model for evaluating reliability of piezoelectric micro-actuators is described. The concept of two-dimensional strength is proposed to incorporate the electric driving voltage and the working temperature of the piezoelectric actuators at a specified lifetime. The lifetime (number of cycles to failure) of piezoelectric actuator, electric load and temperature are considered as the random variables and their probability distributions are discussed. A two-dimensional strength probability distribution function is derived. A two-dimensional interference model between the two-dimensional strength and load is also used to derive the reliability expression. Using this approach, the relationship among the reliability, lifetime, driving voltage and temperature can be described analytically. The relationship between reliability and the lifetime of piezoelectric actuator can be obtained. A case study of a piezoelectric micro-actuator used for head positioning in a disk drive head positioning system demonstrates the application of the approach. It is shown that the two-dimensional probability model can be used for reliability evaluation and lifetime estimation of piezoelectric micro-actuators according to design requirements.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a model to assess the contribution of Human and Organizational Factor (HOF) to accidents. The proposed model is made up of two phases. The first phase is the qualitative analysis of HOF responsible for accidents, which utilizes Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) to seek out latent HOFs. The hierarchy of HOFs identified in the first phase provides inputs for the analysis in the second phase, which is a quantitative analysis using Bayesian Network (BN). BN enhances the ability of HFACS by allowing investigators or domain experts to measure the degree of relationships among the HOFs. In order to estimate the conditional probabilities of BN, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and decomposition method are applied in the model. Case studies show that the model is capable of seeking out critical latent human and organizational errors and carrying out quantitative analysis of accidents. Thereafter, corresponding safety prevention measures are derived.",

An (n,f,k) system further requires that the total number of failed components is less than f for the system to be working. Here we consider a more general system consisting of N modules with the ith module-composed of ni components in parallel: the system fails if find only if there exist at least f failed components or at least k consecutive failed modules. In this paper, some formulae for the reliability of such a generalized k-out-of-n system are derived for both the linear and the circular cases. The recursive formulae established here can be easily computed. Many existing results are also shown to be special cases of the results obtained in this paper. Furthermore, we investigate some component importance properties.",

        "abstract": "Maintenance policies for multi-state systems (MSS) are often analyzed under infinite horizon assumptions. In practice, it is important to consider maintenance policies under a finite horizon because the life cycles of most systems are finite. In this paper, we consider a finite life-cycle MSS that is subject to both degradation and Poisson failures. We study two classes of maintenance policies - preventive replacements and corrective replacements, and their effectiveness in controlling the customer's expected discounted maintenance cost (EDMC). For both policies, replacement decisions are modelled via two control parameters - a threshold on the current system state and a threshold on the residual life cycle, which is measured as the time span from present to the end of life cycle. We derive close-to-explicit forms of the cost models under each of the policy. Methodologies for optimizing the maintenance thresholds are further proposed. Computational results verify that preventive replacements outperform corrective replacements typically when the downtime cost per failure is relatively high compared to the repair cost.",

We define \u2018ageing losses\u2019 as the difference in revenues generated by an ideal system (no ageing) and a real system that ages over the same period of consideration. It is assumed that preventive maintenance slows the system deterioration process and therefore reduces ageing losses. The proposed model is general in the sense that (1) both the warranty contracts and system ageing losses are incorporated in the maintenance cost modeling and (2) the implementation of PM actions does not have to be strictly periodic. A cost model is developed for the buyer under two decision variables\u2014the calendar time of the first PM and the degree of each PM. Numerical examples are then presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. Sensitivity analyses are further conducted to investigate the impact of model parameters on optimal solutions.",

        "abstract": "With the enhancement of hardware and software engineering, the effectiveness and correctness of software is less and less doubted and customers are more aware about whether software services are available or not when needed. Software maintenance is one of the main reasons that make software unavailable and it is often very expensive to perform maintenance tasks. Common approaches of studying software maintenance are to consider it as a static by-product of software operation and only the maintenance cost is covered. In this paper, software maintenance policies are studied with the consideration of unavailable service time. A non-homogeneous continuous Markov chain is adopted for modeling the software operation and maintenance process, and the cost of software unavailability that is brought in by software maintenance is investigated and analyzed for searching the optimal maintenance policy, which aims at minimizing the average maintenance time cost. The optimality of our proposed policy is shown and checked by numerical examples with discussions of its possible application perspectives. Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Therefore, we promote the degradation-based burn-in approach that bases the screening decision on the degradation level of a burnt-in unit. Motivated by the infant mortality faced by many Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMSs), this study develops two degradation-based joint burn-in and maintenance models under the age and the block based maintenances, respectively. We assume that the product population comprises a weak and a normal subpopulations. Degradation of the product follows Wiener processes with linear drift, while the weak and the normal subpopulations possess distinct drift parameters. The objective of joint burn-in and maintenance decisions is to minimize the long run average cost per unit time during field use by properly choosing the burn-in settings and the preventive replacement intervals. An example using the MEMS devices demonstrates effectiveness of these two models. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Then a single-objective optimal solution can be obtained through optimizing the weighted combination of these two measures. Based on this method, we build a specific model when the performance objective is the survival probability given a mission time. We prove that the optimal burn-in duration is decreasing in the weight assigned to the normalized cost. Then, we develop an algorithm to populate the Pareto frontier in case the manufacturer has no idea about the relative weight.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by two real-life examples, this article develops a burn-in planning framework with competing risks. Existing approaches to planning burn-in tests are confined to a single failure mode based on the assumption that this failure mode is subject to infant mortality. Considering the prevalence of competing risks and the high reliability of modern products, our framework differentiates between normal and infant mortality failure modes and recommends degradation-based burn-in approaches. This framework is employed to guide the burn-in planning for an electronic device subject to both a degradation- threshold failure, which is an infant mortality mode and can be modeled by a gamma process with random effect, and a catastrophic mode, which is normal and can be represented with a conventional reliability model. Three degradation-based burn-in models are built and the optimal cutoff degradation levels are derived. Their validity is demonstrated by an electronic device example. We also propose three approaches to deal with uncertainty due to parameter estimation. Algorithmic details and proofs are provided in supplementary material online. \u00a9 2012 American Statistical Association and the American Society for Quality.",

        "abstract": "Complex systems contain both hardware and software, and software reliability becomes more and more essential in system reliability context. In recent years, data-driven software reliability models (DDSRMs) with multiple-delayed-input single-output (MDISO) architecture have been proposed and studied. For these models, the software failure process is viewed as a time series and it is assumed that a software failure is strongly correlated with the most recent failures. In reality, this assumption may not be valid and hence the model performance would be affected. In this paper, we propose a generic DDSRM with MDISO architecture by relaxing this unrealistic assumption. The proposed model can cater for various failure correlations and existing DDSRMs are special cases of the proposed model. A hybrid genetic algorithm (GA)-based algorithm is developed which adopts the model mining technique to discover the correlation of failures and to obtain optimal model parameters. Numerical examples are presented and results reveal that the proposed model outperforms existing DDSRMs. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "It is widely recognized that the debugging processes are usually imperfect. Software faults are not completely removed because of the difficulty in locating them or because new faults might be introduced. Hence, it is of great importance to investigate the effect of the imperfect debugging on software development cost, which, in turn, might affect the optimal software release time or operational budget. In this paper, a commonly used cost model is extended to the case of imperfect debugging. Based on this, the effect of imperfect debugging is studied. As the probability of perfect debugging, termed testing level here, is expensive to be increased, but manageable to a certain extent with additional resources, a model incorporating this situation is presented. Moreover, the problem of determining the optimal testing level is considered. This is useful when the decisions regarding the test team composition, testing strategy, etc., are to be made for more effective testing.",

These parameters are usually inaccurate and thus it is important to study the sensitivity of the estimation. In this paper, the parameter sensitivity problem is studied from two different points of view. First, in addition to point estimation that is commonly used in data analysis, interval estimation is recommended to quantify the errors in the estimated parameters. Second, with the example of sensitivity analysis for the release time determination problem that usually involves both software reliability model parameters and software cost model parameters, a statistical design of experiments technique is employed. This method can not only estimate the effect of separate change of each model parameter, but also estimate the interaction effects when parameters are changed simultaneously. It is useful information for decision maker so that important parameters can be estimated more accurately.",

Correctly rating the importance of every customer requirement is essential to the QFD process because it will largely affect the final target value of a product's technical attributes. This paper proposes a new customer requirements ranking method that considers competitors' information. In today's competitive environment, there are usually several products to fulfill certain functions. The success of a product depends not only on whether it meets the customer requirements, but also on how it compares with competitor products. Most previous methods focus only on the customer perspective, and ignore the competitive environment. The proposed method considers competition position, current performance and customers' viewpoint to produce the ratings. In addition, this method uses fuzzy mathematics instead of crisp numbers to capture the true customer requirements. Compared with previous methods, this method is more meaningful and provides companies with a way to find the best product design strategy. A numerical example is shown to illustrate the approach.",

The system is assumed to suffer both independent internal failures and external common cause shocks, of which arrivals are both modeled by Poisson processes. Periodic missions are assigned to the system due to a fixed schedule. A performance measure is introduced based on the mission workload and number of components working in the system. By modeling the failure modes on such systems with a Markov chain model, the defined reliability and performance is given in analytical forms. In a following numerical example, we illustrate the reliability and performance for such systems by the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Soft sensors are the most commonly used tools to predict hard-to-measure variables in industrial processes. However, the presence of a large number of hard-to-measure variables always renders a generic single-output soft-sensor inadequate. This brief proposed two multiple-output soft sensors, the former based on a novel serial stacking relevant vector machine (RVM) models, called RVMS, by transforming multiple-output into single-output problems inspired by stacking generation and the latter based on ensemble multivariable RVM (EMRVM) models that are improved by ensemble learning. To further strengthen the predicted ability, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and canonical correlation analysis are used to remove irrelevant and redundant information from raw features under the supervision of multivariate targets for RVMS and EMRVM, respectively. The proposed methodologies were first accessed by a well-established wastewater plant (WWTP) validation platform, Benchmark Simulation Model No.1 then evaluated by a real WWTP with data being collected from the field. The results demonstrated that the proposed strategies were able to significantly improve the prediction performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Root cause analysis (RCA) is an essential step in quality and reliability improvement. However, it is not straightforward because most of the time, failure analysis does not always consider the whole system approach. Different applications, scenarios, and objectives require different adaptations and modifications of the approach. In this paper, we present a study of RCA by analyzing major failures of critical components. While many researchers have used and developed various tools and techniques to improve RCA in this aspect, applications of this research in practice still lack. In this study, one of the more established models; Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) using DesignVUE, is implemented in a water utility set up to solve the problem of major failures of Asbestos Cement (AC) pipes. In this work, we present a case study of major failures with serious consequences of pipe failures in a water system. Incorporating RCA with IBIS is useful in mapping a debate on engineering problems that occur in service. A major mistake made when carrying out RCA of engineering related failures is isolating a failed component overlooking the involvement of other players and their role to prevent reoccurrence of failures.",

        "abstract": "The mission-oriented system is subject to both degradation and external shocks.Maintenance actions can only be implemented after a mission is completed.Reliability model and maintenance model are formulated for mission-oriented system.Optimal maintenance strategy is obtained by minimizing the long-run cost rate.Numerical results show that mission duration has significant impact on maintenance schedule. This paper develops a maintenance model for mission-oriented systems subject to natural degradation and external shocks. For mission-oriented systems which are used to perform safety-critical tasks, maintenance actions need to satisfy a range of constraints such as availability/reliability, maintenance duration and the opportunity of maintenance. Additionally, in developing maintenance policy, one needs to consider the natural degradation due to aging and wearing along with the external shocks due to variations of the operating environment. In this paper, the natural degradation is modeled as a Wiener process and the arrival of random shock as a homogeneous Poisson process. The damage caused by shocks is integrated into the degradation process, according to the cumulative shock model. Improvement factor model is used to characterize the impact of maintenance actions on system restoration. Optimal maintenance policy is obtained by minimizing the long-run cost rate. Finally, an example of subsea blowout preventer system is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "Most of the maintenance policies in existing publications assume that no cost is incurred as long as the system can undertake missions while little consideration has been devoted to the operating cost during system operation. However, in practice, the operating cost increases while the system ages and degrades even if a system is in a functioning state. This paper proposes a maintenance policy for a degrading system with age- and state-dependent operating cost, which increases with system age and degradation levels. Under such a setting, a replacement model is first developed to investigate the optimal preventive replacement policy. The replacement model is then extended to a repair-replacement model, in which imperfect repair is assumed to restore the system to the operating condition. Particularly, the repair model with controllable and uncontrollable repair levels is considered separately. The paper proves that the optimal maintenance policy is actually a monotone control limit policy, where the optimal control limits decrease monotonically with system age. Finally, a numerical example along with sensitivity analysis is presented to illustrate the optimal maintenance policy. The proposed model implies a more conservative maintenance policy, compared with the traditional model without the age- and state-dependent operating cost.",

The cumulative damage is modeled by a continuous degradation process. Different from previous studies which assume that the system fails when the degradation level exceeds a specific threshold, this paper argues that the degradation itself does not directly lead to system failure, but increases the failure risk of the system. Proportional hazards model (PHM) is employed to characterize the joint effect of aging and cumulative damage. CBM models are developed for two cases: one assumes that the distribution parameters of the degradation process are known in advance, while the other assumes that the parameters are unknown and need to be estimated during system operation. In the first case, an optimal maintenance policy is obtained by minimizing the long-run cost rate. For the case with unknown parameters, periodic inspection is adopted to monitor the degradation level of the system and update the distribution parameters. A case study of Asphalt Plug Joint in UK bridge system is employed to illustrate the maintenance policy.",

Components of the system are assumed to suffer from hidden failures, which can only be detected at inspection. The objective of the maintenance policy is to determine the inspection intervals for each component such that the long-run cost rate is minimized. Due to the dependence among components, an exact optimal solution is difficult to obtain. Concerned with the intractability of the problem, a heuristic method named \u201cbase interval approach\u201d is adopted to reduce the computational complexity. Performance of the base interval approach is analyzed, and the result shows that the proposed policy can approximate the optimal policy within a small factor.

Use of Studentu0027s  t -distribution, rather than Gaussian distribution, in the VBMCCA model makes the proposed process monitoring scheme insensitive to disturbances, measurement noises, and model discrepancies. A sequential perturbation (SP) method together with derived parameter distribution of VBMCCA is employed to approach the uncertainty levels, which is able to provide a confidence interval around the predicted values and give additional control line, rather than just a certain absolute control limit, for process monitoring. The proposed process monitoring framework has been validated in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) simulated by benchmark simulation model with abrupt changes imposing on a sensor and a real WWTP with filamentous sludge bulking. The results show that the proposed methodology is capable of detecting sensor faults and process faults with satisfactory accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a dynamic maintenance strategy for prognostics and health management (PHM) of a degrading system. The system under investigation suffers a continuous degradation process, modeled as a Gamma process. In addition to the degradation process, the system is subject to aging, which contributes to the increase of failure rate. An additive model is employed to describe the impact of degradation level and aging on system failure rate. Inspection is implemented upon the system so as to effectively avoid failure. At inspection, the system will be repaired or replaced in terms of the degradation level. Different from previous studies which assume that repair will always lead to an improvement on system degradation, in our study, however, the effect of repair is twofold. It will reduce the system age to 0 but will increase the degradation level. System reliability is analyzed as a first step to serve for the maintenance decision making. Based on the reliability evolution, a maintenance model is formulated with respect to the inspection time. The optimal decision is achieved by minimizing the expected cost rate in one repair cycle. Finally, a case study of locomotive wheel-sets is adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our approach incorporates the joint influence of aging and degradation process, and determines the optimal inspection time dynamically, which exhibits the advantage of flexibility and can achieve better performance in field use.",

Motivated by reduction of the overall complexities of BNs for fault diagnosis, and the reporting of faults that immediately occur, a real-time fault diagnosis methodology of complex systems with repetitive structures is proposed using object-oriented Bayesian networks (OOBNs). The modeling methodology consists of two main phases: an off-line OOBN construction phase and an on-line fault diagnosis phase. In the off-line phase, sensor historical data and expert knowledge are collected and processed to determine the faults and symptoms, and OOBN-based fault diagnosis models are developed subsequently. In the on-line phase, operator experience and sensor real-time data are placed in the OOBNs to perform the fault diagnosis. According to engineering experience, the judgment rules are defined to obtain the fault diagnosis results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Chemical and petrochemical accidents, such as fires and explosions, do not happen frequently but have considerable consequences. These accidents compromise not only human safety but also cause significant economic losses and environmental contamination. The increasing complexity of chemical infrastructures increases the requirements of risk prevention. Thus, risk analysis for petrochemical systems is essential in helping analysts find the weakest process in the entire system and be used to strengthen the process and improve safety. Risk analysis has been previously studied; however, traditional methods have limitations. This study proposes a methodology that is based on Bayesian networks by giving a model for system risk analysis. The event is classified into three categories; cause, incident, and accident, according to criticality and thus, the model is analyzed as a three-layered structure. The application of the methodology is demonstrated by analyzing a vacuum distillation and an atmospheric unit. An exact reasoning method is used to infer the causality and probability within the events. After inferring the relationship between causes and accidents, mutual information and variance of beliefs are calculated to find the most sensitive event in an accident. Subsequently, means of strengthening operations to prevent accidents are suggested. This study may help companies decrease the cost of risk reduction.",

Inverters are the weakest components in the drive system, and power switches are the most vulnerable components in inverters. Fault detection and diagnosis of inverters are extremely necessary for improving drive system reliability. Motivated by solving the uncertainty problem in fault diagnosis of inverters, which is caused by various reasons, such as bias and noise of sensors, this paper proposes a Bayesian network-based data-driven fault diagnosis methodology of three-phase inverters. Two output line-to-line voltages for different fault modes are measured, the signal features are extracted using fast Fourier transform, the dimensions of samples are reduced using principal component analysis, and the faults are detected and diagnosed using Bayesian networks. Simulated and experimental data are used to train the fault diagnosis model, as well as validate the proposed fault diagnosis methodology.",

As the performance of electronic products degrades over time, the results of fault diagnosis could be different at different times for the given identical fault symptoms. A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)-based fault diagnosis methodology in the presence of TF and IF for electronic systems is proposed. DBNs are used to model the dynamic degradation process of electronic products, and Markov chains are used to model the transition relationships of four states, i.e., no fault, TF, IF, and permanent fault. Our fault diagnosis methodology can identify the faulty components and distinguish the fault types. Four fault diagnosis cases of the Genius modular redundancy control system are investigated to demonstrate the application of this methodology.",

Resilience is considered an intrinsic ability and an inherent attribute of an engineering system. Engineering system structure and maintenance resources are principal factors that affect resilience, which are integrated into the engineering resilience metric. A corresponding dynamic-Bayesian-network-based evaluation methodology is developed on the basis of the proposed resilience metric. The resilience value of an engineering system can be predicted using the proposed methodology, which provides an implementation guidance for engineering planning, design, operation, construction, and management. Some examples for common systems (i.e., series, parallel, and voting systems) and an actual application example (i.e., a nine-bus power grid system) are used to demonstrate the application of the proposed resilience metric and its corresponding evaluation methodology.",

Our contributions include: (1) resource reservation for local nets during the coarsening process, (2) congestion-driven, graph-based Steiner tree construction during the initial routing and the refinement process and (3) multi-iteration refinement considering the congestion history. The experiments show that each of these techniques helps to improve the completion rate considerately. Compared to (19), the new routing system reduces the number of failed nets by 2\u00d7 to 18\u00d7 , with less than 50% increase in runtime in most cases.",

The placement problem has been studied extensively in the past 30 years. However, recent studies show that existing placement solutions are surprisingly far from optimal. The first part of this tutorial summarizes results from recent optimality and scalability studies of existing placement tools. These studies show that the results of leading placement tools from both industry and academia may be up to 50&percent; to 150&percent; away from optimal in total wirelength. If such a gap can be closed, the corresponding performance improvement will be equivalent to several technology-generation advancements. The second part of the tutorial highlights the recent progress on large-scale circuit placement, including techniques for wirelength minimization, routability optimization, and performance optimization.",

It consistently produces robust, high-quality solutions to difficult instances of mixed-size placement in fast and scalable run time. Best-choice clustering (ISPD05) is used to construct a hierarchy of problem formulations. Generalized force-directed placement guides global placement at each level of the cluster hierarchy. During the declustering pass from coarsest to finest level, large movable objects are gradually fixed in positions without overlapping with one another. This progressive legalization of large objects during continuous optimization supports determination of a completely overlap-free configuration as close as possible to the continuous solution. Various discrete heuristics are applied to this legalized placement in order to improve the final wirelength.",

This version is derived from the mPL5 placer (ISPD05) and the Patoma floorplanner (ASPDAC05). It is also augmented by new techniques for detailed placement. As a result, it can handle mixed-size placement very effectively. First-choice clustering is used to construct a hierarchy of problem formulations. Generalized force-directed placement guides global placement at each level of the cluster hierarchy. Prior to interpolation of each coarse-level solution to its adjacent finer level, however, recursive, top-down displacement-minimizing floorplanning optimizes block orientations and checks that overlap can be removed at the current level. Where necessary, the floor-planner perturbs coarse-level solutions enough that legalization of the given placement can be assured. The resulting flow is scalable and robust, and it produces very low-wirelength solutions for known benchmark circuits.",

We present algorithms to construct two classes of benchmarks, one for partitioning and the other for placement, which have known upper bounds of their optimal solutions, and can match any given net distribution vector. Using these partitioning and placement benchmarks, we studied the optimality of state-of-the-art algorithms by comparing their solutions with the upper bounds of the optimal solutions, and their scalability and stability by varying the sizes and characteristics of the benchmarks. The conclusions from this study are: 1) State-of-the-art, multilevel two way partitioning algorithms scale very well and are able to find solutions very close to the upper bounds of the optimal solutions of our benchmarks. This suggests that existing circuit partitioning techniques are fairly mature. There is not much room for improvement for cutsize minimization for problems of the current sizes. Multiway partitioning algorithms, on the other hand, do not perform that well. Their results can be up to 18% worse than our estimated upper bounds. 2) The state-of-the-art placement algorithms produce significantly inferior results compared with the estimated optimal solutions. There is still significant room for improvement in circuit placement. 3) Existing placement algorithms are not stable. Their effectiveness varies considerably depending on the characteristics of the benchmarks. New hybrid techniques are probably needed for future generation placement engines that are more scalable and stable.",

        "abstract": "The rapid increase in IC design complexity and wide-spread use of intellectual-property (IP) blocks have made the so-called mixed-size placement a very important topic in recent years. Although several algorithms have been proposed for mixed-sized placements, most of them primarily focus on the global placement aspect. In this paper we propose a three-step approach, named XDP, for mixed-size detailed placement. First, a combination of constraint graph and linear programming is used to legalize macros. Then, an enhanced greedy method is used to legalize the standard cells. Finally, a sliding-window-based cell swapping is applied to further reduce wirelength. The impact of individual techniques is analyzed and quantified. Experiments show that when applied to the set of global placement results generated by APlace [1], XDP can produce wirelength comparable to the native detailed placement of APlace, and 3% shorter wirelength compared to Fengshui 5.0 [2]. When applied to the set of global placements generated by mPL6 [3], XDP is the only detailed placement that successfully produces legal placement for all the examples, while APlace and Fengshui fail for 4/9 and 1/3 of the examples. For cases where legal placements can be compared, the wirelength produced by XDP is shorter by 3% on average compared to APlace and Fengshui. Furthermore, XDP displays a higher robustness than the other tools by covering a broader spectrum of examples by different global placement tools.",

        "abstract": "Placement is an important step in the overall IC design process in deep submicron technologies, as it defines the on-chip interconnects which have become the bottleneck in determining circuit performance. The rapidly increasing design complexity, combined with the demand for the capability of handling nearly flattened designs for physical hierarchy generation, poses significant challenges to existing placement algorithms. There are very few studies dedicated to understanding the optimality (i.e., the comparison of the solution of an algorithm to the optimal solution) and scalability (i.e., the analysis of the degradation of the performance of an algorithm as the input size of the problem increases) of placement algorithms, due to the limited sizes of existing benchmarks and limited knowledge of optimal solutions. The contribution of this work includes three parts. 1) We implemented an algorithm [Placement Examples with Known Optimal (PEKO) algorithm] for generating synthetic benchmarks that have known optimal wirelengths and can match any given net degree distribution profile. 2) Using benchmarks of 10 k to 2 M placeable modules with known optimal solutions, we studied the optimality and scalability of four state-of-the-art placers, Dragon (Wang et al., 2000), Capo (Caldwell et al., 2000), mPL (Chan et al., 2000), and mPG (Chang et al., 2002) from academia, and a leading edge industrial placer, QPlace (Cadence 1999) from Cadence. For the first time our study reveals the gap between the results produced by these tools versus true optimal solutions. The wirelengths produced by these tools are 1.59 to 2.40 times the optimal in the worst cases, and are 1.43 to 2.12 times the optimal on average. As for scalability, the average solution quality of each tool deteriorates by an additional 9% to 17% when the problem size increases by a factor of ten. These results indicate significant room for improvement in existing placement algorithms. 3) We studied the impact of nonlocal nets on the quality of the placers by extending the PEKO algorithm (PEKU algorithm) to generate synthetic placement benchmarks with a known upper bound of the optimal wirelength. For these benchmarks, the wirelengths produced by these tools are 1.75 to 2.18 times the wirelength upper bound in the - worst case, and are 1.62 to 2.07 times the wirelength upper bound on average. Moreover, in our study we found that the effectiveness of the algorithms varies for circuits with different characteristics.",

        "title": "Constraint-driven large-scale circuit placement algorithms",
        "abstract": "Placement is an important step in the physical design of VLSI chips. The exponential growth of on-chip complexity has dramatically increased the demand for scalable optimization algorithms for large-scale physical design. Modern designs, due to the constraints involved, have posed tremendous challenges to placement algorithms. In this Ph.D. dissertation, we focus on several aspects of constraint-driven placement algorithms. First, we study extensively the optimality and scalability of wirelength-driven and timing-driven placement algorithms. For the first time, our study reveals the gap between results produced by state-of-the-art placement algorithms and the true optima. Experiment results show the wirelength produced by existing tools is 24% to 111% longer than the optima on average. The circuit delay produced by existing timing-driven placement tools is 4% to 18% longer than the optima on average. Second, we propose a rout ability-driven multilevel placement workflow. We enhance the routability during global placement by re-placing cells to avoid congested regions. A congestion-driven white space allocation is applied after the global placement stage to provide appropriate routing resources to congested regions. Experiment results show that we achieve placements with the best routability among the publicly available placement tools, with all IBM-Dragon v2 easy and hard circuits successfully routed with 5% to 13% shorter wirelength. Third, we propose a combination of the constraint-graph-based method and linear programming for mixed-size legalization. Using the legalization as a building block, we propose a three step mixed-size detailed placement algorithm, XDP. Experiments show that XDP can produce comparable or better results using placements generated by different global placement tools. Furthermore, XDP is 10X faster than its competitor on examples with more than 2M movable objects. The legalization algorithm has also been applied in each refinement level of global placement. Macros are selectively legalized and fixed. Experiments show that this scheme can help to reduce the final wirelength by 6% and runtime by 25% on average. Experiments also show that with this legalization algorithm, a 12% reduction in wirelength can be obtained compared to all macros pre-fixed. Fourth, we propose the first analytical placement algorithm for heterogeneous placement, mPL-H. Based on the multilevel generalized force-directed formulation, the algorithm creates multiple layers, each corresponding to one type of placeable resource on the chip. Forbidden regions are pre-occupied by blockages. Filler cells are introduced to enhance the quality and stability of the algorithm. When compared to a leading edge commercial placer for FPGA, mPL-H produces 3% shorter half-perimeter wirelength and 2% shorter routed wirelength on average. mPL-H also shows better scalability when the circuits become sufficiently large. With more than 4K movable objects, mPL-H is 2x faster.",

The multilevel framework with recursive coarsening and refinement allows for scaling of our gridless routing system to very large designs. The downward pass of recursive coarsening builds the representations of routing regions at different levels while the upward pass of iterative refinement allows a gradually improved solution. We introduced a number of efficient techniques in the multilevel routing scheme, including resource reservation, graph-based Steiner tree heuristic and history-based iterative refinement. We compared our multilevel framework with a recently published three-level routing flow . Experimental results show that MARS helps to improve the completion rate by over 10%, and the runtime by 11.7\u00d7.",

First, during each refinement stage of our multilevel global placement framework, we replace cells based on the wirelength weighted by congestion level to reduce the routing demands of congested regions. Second, after the global placement stage, we allocate appropriate amounts of white space into different regions of the chip according to a congestion map by shifting cut lines in a top-down fashion and apply a detailed placer to legalize the placement and further reduce the half-perimeter wirelength while preserving the distribution of white space. Experimental results show that our placement flow can achieve the best routability with the shortest routed wirelength among publicly available placement tools on IBM v2 benchmarks. Our placer obtains 100% successful routings on 16 IBM v2 benchmarks with shorter routed wirelengths by 3.1% to 24.5% compared to other placement tools. Moreover, our white space allocation approach can significantly improve the routability of placements generated by other placement tools",

This paper proposes a systematic methodology to deal with customer needs' dynamics, in terms of their relative weights, in the QFD. Compared to previous research, its contribution is three-fold. First, it proposes the use of a forecasting technique which is effective to model the dynamics of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based importance rating. This is owing to the fact that the AHP has been applied very extensively in the QFD and there is, unfortunately, almost no tool to model the dynamics. Second, it describes more comprehensively on how future uncertainty in the weights of customer needs may be estimated and transmitted to the design attributes. Third, it proposes the use a quantitative approach that takes into account the decision maker's attitude towards risk to optimize the QFD decision making analysis. Finally, an example based on a real-world application of QFD is provided to show the practical applicability of the proposed methodology.",

        "abstract": "Quality Function Deployment (QFD), as a customer-driven tool, is generally used in the early phase of new or improved products/services design process, and therefore most of the input parameters are highly subjective in nature. The five major input components of the QFD, which are laid in the House of Quality (HOQ), namely, the customer requirement, the technical attribute, the relationship matrix, the correlation matrix, and the benchmarking information, play a central role in determining the success of QFD team. Accurate numerical judgment representations are of high importance for the QFD team to fill in the values of each of those components. In this paper, a generic network model, based on Analytic Network Process (ANP) framework, will be proposed to systematically take into account the interrelationship between and within those components simultaneously and finally derive their relative contribution. In particular, with respect to a rapidly changing market, the incorporation of the new product development risk, the competitors' benchmarking information, and the feedback information into the network model may be considered as a novel contribution in QFD literature. Not only does this network model improve the QFD results' accuracy, but it also serves as a generalized model of the use of ANP in QFD with respect to the previous research. A simple illustrative example of the proposed network model will be provided to give some practical insights.",

Traditional resource allocation strategies usually concern on static assignment, which lacks dynamic adjustment functions. Dynamic Random Testing (DRT) strategy employs feedback mechanism to guide the selection of test cases, which is shown to be effective and has great potential in theoretical as well as practical terms. Therefore, planting the idea of DRT into cloud testing can allocate the test tasks in a dynamic way. In this paper, a cloud-based dynamic random testing strategy is proposed to enhance the testing process and promote the testing efficiency, in which the virtual resource allocation is in accordance with the testing results. A framework of cloud-based DRT strategy is constructed and contrast experiments are conducted on the Cloudsim platform. The experimental results show that the proposed cloud-based DRT strategy has better performance than the traditional testing strategies.",

        "abstract": "A particularly good software testing strategy is to achieve the underlying testing goal while solving the problems of tradeoffs between testing effectiveness and efficiency. To improve the fault detection effectiveness of software testing, the principle of feedback control theory was adopted, which motivated the proposal of dynamic random testing (DRT). The main idea behind DRT is using the testing results to guide the test case selection to increase the selection probabilities of the subdomains with higher fault detection rates. Previous works show that DRT strategy can achieve better effectiveness than random testing strategy and random partition testing strategy, and has significantly lower computational costs than adaptive testing strategy. However, the essential factors that affect the performance of DRT, i.e., adjusting parameters, initial profile, and test case classification have not been thoroughly investigated. Besides, some experimental assumptions are inconsistent with real scenarios. Therefore, this paper gives a series of investigations on DRT with a set of practical subject programs. More specifically, the effectiveness and efficiency of DRT are presented, and the extended experiments on DRT with relevant factors are conducted. The results indicate that the effectiveness of DRT is robust to different initial profiles and affected noticeably by the adjusting parameter settings and test case classification methods.",

Histopathological changes include interstitial myocardial fibrosis and the appearance of vacuolated cardiomyocytes. Whereas dysregulation of autophagy in the myocardium has been implicated in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, the role of autophagy in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy remains poorly defined. Methods and Results\u2014Most models of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity involve intraperitoneal injection of high-dose drug, which elicits lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, and peritoneal fibrosis, all of which confound the interpretation of autophagy. Given this, we first established a model that provokes modest and progressive cardiotoxicity without constitutional symptoms, reminiscent of the effects seen in patients. We report that doxorubicin blocks cardiomyocyte autophagic flux in vivo and in cardiomyocytes in culture. This block was accompanied by robust accumulation of undegraded autolysosomes.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Reperfusion injury during myocardial infarction accounts for approximately half of final infarct size. Whereas this has been known for decades, efficacious therapy targeting reperfusion injury remains elusive. Many proteins are subject to reversible acetylation, and drugs targeting enzymes that govern these events have emerged in oncology. Among these, small molecules targeting protein deacetylating enzymes, so-called histone deacetylases (HDACs), are approved for human use in rare cancers. Now, work emerging from multiple laboratories, and in both mice and large animals, has documented that HDAC inhibition using compounds approved for clinical use confers robust cardioprotection when delivered at the time of myocardial reperfusion. Here, we summarize the key underpinnings of this science, discuss potential mechanisms, and provide a framework for a first-in-human clinical trial.",

Three design examples of pattern synthesis have been chosen to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of WOA when compared to synthesis techniques described in the literature. The results show that the WOA achieves lowest maximum sidelobe level combined with deepest null depth level with narrow first null beamwidth relative to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The WOA results and convergence tests demonstrate superior applicability of this novel optimization algorithm.",

This paper presents a waveform synthesis method for adaptive radar based on a cascade of the water-filling algorithm and iterative least squares (LS) approach. The optimal energy spectrum density (ESD) of the synthesized waveform is obtained by the water-filling algorithm based on maximizing the mutual information (MI) criterion; the echo can then extract the maximum amount of target information. The iterative LS approach is used to synthesize the complex-valued waveform in time domain while the modulus of synthesized waveform remains constant, which is helpful for maintaining the transmitter efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal waveform synthesis method is competent for adaptive radar.",

In view of pulse system range tracking radar, this paper proposes a new scheme of the inter-frame multiplicative non-coherent processing which counters the co-frequency synchronous range false target deception jamming with the pulse repetition period (PRT) agility. Radar system sends random PRT agility, and makes the responder synchronous false targets change into asynchronous false targets after entering the radar receiver, and then suppresses jamming by inter-frame multiplicative non-coherent accumulation.

Velocity gate pull off (VGPO) jamming is an active deception jamming aiming at velocity automatic tracking system. The system of Pulse Doppler (PD) tracking radar may face VGPO jamming, so a new method of anti-jamming is proposed in this paper. First of all, it judges the jamming towing direction from the velocity gate moving acceleration, then tracks the target velocity using front-back-edge tracking method in Doppler domain. Using the front-edge tracking method counters jamming while jamming is posterior to the target echo, and using the back-edge tracking method counters the jamming while jamming is in front of target echo. The simulation results show that this method has good effectiveness of anti-VGPO jamming.",

        "abstract": "Noise usually has an unwelcome influence on system performance. For instance, noise inevitably affects the low-frequency mechanical freedom in optomechanical experiments. However, we investigate here the beneficial effects of thermal noise on a basic optomechanical system with parametric instability. In a regime near parametric instability, it is found that thermal noise in the mechanical freedom can sustain long-term quasi-coherent oscillations when the system would otherwise remain in the equilibrium state. In an overlapping regime of parametric instability and bistability, intermittent switching between a self-sustained oscillating state and an equilibrium can be induced by adding a certain amount of noise. When a subthreshold periodic signal is applied to the mechanics, the switching between the self-sustained oscillations and the equilibrium exhibits good periodicity at a rate that is synchronized to the signal frequency, resulting in a significant amplification of the signal. Our results deepen the understanding of the interplay between optomechanical nonlinearity and noise and provide theoretical guidance for experimental observation of noise-induced beneficial phenomena in optomechanics.",

The quadratic optomechanical coupling allows us to find a region with tristability where the noise-activated stochastic switching among three stable states occurs and SR phenomena are observed at the cooperation of input signals and noise. We show that the mechanical force and the optical field respectively serve as an additive signal and a multiplicative signal to the membrane position, and they induce completely different SR behaviors. Moreover, when two signals coexist the SR effect can be enhanced, and the beating effect appears in the SR synchronization process with unsynchronized signals.",

The SR effect is systematically studied in the semiclassical and full quantum frameworks and in both cases we find that SRs simultaneously occur for the optical and atomic freedoms. In particular, at zero temperature quantum SR can be induced merely by vacuum fluctuations. The qualitative features of semiclassical SR and quantum SR are similar, but the parameter region of quantum SR are shifted from the semiclassical region due to the widely-used factorization in obtaining semiclassical equations of motion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for experimentally observing and studying the SR phenomenon of the Jaynes-Cummings model in the quantum regime.",

When two signals co-act on our system, the interference effect between the optically induced SR and the mechanically induced SR can be generated.

By splitting a single photon and performing subsequent state transfer, we separate the generation of entanglement and its frequency conversion, and find that the both progresses have the characteristic of inherent determinacy. Our theory can reproduce the prominent features of observed results including pulse shapes and the condition for deterministically generating the FME single photons. The schemes are suitable for the entangled photon pairs with a wider frequency range, and could be immune to the photon loss originating from cavity-mode damping, spontaneous emission, and the dephasing due to atomic thermal motion. The sources might have significant applications in wavelength-division-multiplexing quantum key distribution.",

The group velocity of the probe field can be switched from subluminal to superluminal or vice versa by modulating the relative phase of the two applied light fields. In contrast to the counterpropagating setting, the copropagating case is more suitable for the purpose considered in this paper due to the effectiveness of Doppler-free.",

PL peak position can be tuned from 1.90 to 2.90 eV by adjusting the film composition. The luminescence lifetime is within the nanosecond range. The dependence of the PL lifetime on the emission energy suggests that band tail states are involved in the thermalization and recombination of photon-generated carriers. This is further supported by the correlation between the optical band gap, the PL peak energy, and the width of the PL spectrum. We propose that optical transitions among band tail states are the main light emission mechanisms. \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Previous systematical reviews showed that systemic magnesium decreased postoperative pain and reduced morphine use without any reported serious adverse effects in adults. However studies in children yielded different results. So we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of magnesium sulphate on postoperative complications in Children undergoing tonsillectomies.The PubMed, EMbase via OVID, CENTRAL, WHO ICTRP were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that addressed the effect of magnesium for postoperative pain, agitation and complications in children undergoing tonsillectomies. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility and assessed the quality of the included studies. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3.Ten RCTs involving 665 participates published between 2003 to 2015 were included. Eight studies showed no significant different effect on pain scores between MgSO4 and control groups. Two studies showed significant lower EA incidence in MgSO4 group (pooled OR = 0.18, 95%CI 0.07 to 0.48, P = 0.0006). Five studies showed rescue analgesia was significantly reduced in MgSO4 group (RR = 0.53, 95%CI 0.31 to 0.91, P = 0.02). Laryngospasm was founded significantly lower in MgSO4 group (OR = 0.36, 95%CI 0.13 to 0.96, P = 0.04). PONV was found no significant difference between two groups (OR = 1.23, 95%CI 0.70 to 2.18, P = 0.47).Unlike the studies in adults, this review shows there is no statistically significant effect of perioperative use of magnesium in the postoperative pain control in children undergoing tonsillectomies. But it seems has benefits in reducing rescue analgesia, emergence agitation incidence and laryngospasm without increasing severe adverse effects. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Phased array radar (PAR)is an important part of modern military electronic equipment. Multi-channel data synchronous acquisition is a key technology that needs to be solved when receiving and processing PAR signal. Traditional parallel acquisition systems have low channel integration and limited transmission rate, which does not meet the trend of miniaturization, high bandwidth and deterministic delay of data acquisition systems. This paper briefly introduces the principle of phased array radar, and principle of JESD204B protocol for synchronous design. Based on the full understanding of the principle, this paper analyzes the key technology of synchronization using this protocol and designs a multi-channel data acquisition board. The board realizes single system synchronization through strict routing, and achieves multi-system synchronization using the master-slave system design. The test results show that the data acquisition system using JESD204B protocol can effectively realize multi-channel data synchronous acquisition.",

Because the high-speed serial protocol JESD204B can easily realize the channel synchronization between the converters and the FPGA, and the serial interface eliminates the redundant associated clock, the system adopts JESD204B as the data interface. Based on the characteristics of good real-time performance, simple structure, flexibility and efficiency of the System of Programmable Chip (SoPC), the system uses SoPC technology to dynamically configure the chips and Intellectual Property (IP)cores through the Microblaze soft core processor. Finally, this paper completed the construction of the hardware platform for real-time signal acquisition and processing playback, and realized the expected functions of the system.",

        "abstract": "Quality of the turbine engine directly affects aircraft performance. In order to improve engine efficiency and ensure its safe work, it is important to monitor the clearance between the blade tip and the engine casing. This paper introduces a continuous wave sensing system, which can achieve precise ranging by calculates the phase difference between transmitting RF signals and receiving RF signals. To speed up the signal processing of the measurement system, FPGA is used to process the acquired signal to obtain the phase. Besides, the Xilinx Vivado HLS compiler is used for algorithm development so that further reduces the cost of development and optimization.",

Low thermal shrinkage, distinct shut-down effect, high liquid electrolyte uptake capacity, and exciting liquid electrolyte wettability of the prepared c-P-PAEK/PVDF membrane have been revealed through comprehensive study. Moreover, the c-P-PAEK/PVDF membrane was applied to assemble a conventional Li/LiFePO4 coin cell, which exhibited hopeful cell performance. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

As a separator of lithium-ion batteries, the prepared PESPDA nanofibrous membrane shows ultrahigh porosity, due to the extra-large surface area of the nanofibers. Moreover, good thermostability of PES and polydopamine also results in the low shrinkage of the membrane under high temperature. As a result of the large number of amine groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups from the polydopamine, superior electrolyte wettability and high liquid electrolyte uptake capacity of the PES-PDA nanofibrous membrane have also been disclosed through comprehensive study, which would decrease the electrolyte absorption time and improve the performance of the battery. In the cell evaluation, an expected enhancement of cell performance with reduced polarization phenomenon and improved cycling stability is observed after coating with polydopamine, which certifies the validity of the polydopamine coating.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial microRNAs (myo-miRs) are released into the circulation after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). How they impact remote organs is however largely unknown. Here we show that circulating myo-miRs are carried in exosomes and mediate functional crosstalk between the ischemic heart and the bone marrow (BM). In mice, we find that AMI is accompanied by an increase in circulating levels of myo-miRs, with miR-1, 208, and 499 predominantly in circulating exosomes and miR-133 in the non-exosomal component. Myo-miRs are imported selectively to peripheral organs and preferentially to the BM. Exosomes mediate the transfer of myo-miRs to BM mononuclear cells (MNCs), where myo-miRs downregulate CXCR4 expression. Injection of exosomes isolated from AMI mice into wild-type mice downregulates CXCR4 expression in BM-MNCs and increases the number of circulating progenitor cells. Thus, we propose that myo-miRs carried in circulating exosomes allow a systemic response to cardiac injury that may be leveraged for cardiac repair.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays an essential role in the tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1)-and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2)-induced I\u03baB kinase (IKK)/nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein 1 (AP-1) activation. Here we report that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induce Lys63-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys158 residue within the kinase domain. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors 2 and 6 (TRAF2 and -6) act as the ubiquitin E3 ligases to mediate Lys63-linkedTAK1polyubiquitination at the Lys158 residue in vivo and in vitro. Lys63-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys158 residue is required for TAK1-mediated IKK complex recruitment. Reconstitution of TAK1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblast cells with TAK1 wild type or a TAK1 mutant containing a K158R mutation revealed the importance of this site in TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2-mediated IKK/NF-\u03baB and JNK/AP-1 activation as well as IL-6 gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 at Lys158 is essential for its own kinase activation and its ability to mediate its downstream signal transduction pathways in response to TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. \u00a9 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in insulin resistance. Here we report that mice with a T-cell-specific conditional knockout of HGK (T-HGK cKO) develop systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. This condition is ameliorated by either IL-6 or IL-17 neutralization. HGK directly phosphorylates TRAF2, leading to its lysosomal degradation and subsequent inhibition of IL-6 production. IL-6-overproducing HGK-deficient T cells accumulate in adipose tissue and further differentiate into IL-6/IL-17 double-positive cells. Moreover, CCL20 neutralization or CCR6 deficiency reduces the Th17 population or insulin resistance in T-HGK cKO mice. In addition, leptin receptor deficiency in T cells inhibits Th17 differentiation and improves the insulin sensitivity in T-HGK cKO mice, which suggests that leptin cooperates with IL-6 to promote Th17 differentiation. Thus, HGK deficiency induces TRAF2/IL-6 upregulation, leading to IL-6/leptin-induced Th17 differentiation in adipose tissue and subsequent insulin resistance. These findings provide insight into the reciprocal regulation between the immune system and the metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Lowering total tau levels is an attractive therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. High-throughput screening in neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a powerful tool to identify tau-targeted therapeutics. However, such screens have been hampered by heterogeneous neuronal production, high cost and low yield, and multi-step differentiation procedures. We engineered an isogenic iPSC line that harbors an inducible neurogenin 2 transgene, a transcription factor that rapidly converts iPSCs to neurons, integrated at the AAVS1 locus. Using a simplified two-step protocol, we differentiated these iPSCs into cortical glutamatergic neurons with minimal well-to-well variability. We developed a robust high-content screening assay to identify tau-lowering compounds in LOPAC and identified adrenergic receptors agonists as a class of compounds that reduce endogenous human tau. These techniques enable the use of human neurons for high-throughput screening of drugs to treat neurodegenerative disease.",

        "abstract": "Lost or damaged cells in tissues and organs can be replaced by transplanting therapeutically competent cells. This approach requires methods that effectively manipulate cellular identities and properties to generate sufficient numbers of desired cell types for transplantation. These cells can be generated by reprogramming readily available somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can replicate indefinitely and give rise to any somatic cell type. This reprogramming can be achieved with genetic methods, such as forced expression of pluripotency-inducing transcription factors (TFs), which can be further improved, or even avoided, with pharmacological agents. We screened chemical libraries for such agents and identified small molecules that enhance TF-mediated pluripotency induction in somatic cells. We also developed cocktails of small molecules that can functionally replace combinations of TFs required to induce pluripotency in mouse and human somatic cells. Importantly, we devised and established a general strategy to develop effective pharmacological cocktails for specific cellular reprogramming processes. In the search for useful small molecules, we also discovered and characterized previously unknown mechanisms pertinent to cellular reprogramming. A more direct method to access scarce cells for cell transplantation is transdifferentiation, which uses combinations of cell-type specific TFs to reprogram fibroblasts into the target somatic cell types across lineage boundaries. We created an alternative strategy for cellular transdifferentiation that epigenetically activates somatic cells by pairing temporal treatment with reprogramming molecules and tissue-specific signaling molecules to generate cells of multiple lineages. Using this cell-activation and signaling-directed (CASD) transdifferentiation paradigm, we converted fibroblasts into a variety of somatic cells found in major organs, such as the heart, brain, pancreas, and liver. Specifically, we induced, isolated, and expanded (long-term) lineage-specific progenitor cells that can give rise to a defined range of cell types relevant to specific tissues or organs. Transplanting these progenitor cells or their progeny was therapeutically beneficial in animal models of diseases and organ damage. Importantly, we developed chemically defined conditions, without any genetic factors, that convert fibroblasts into cells of the cardiac and neural lineages, further extending the realm of pharmacological reprogramming of cells. Continuously advancing technologies in pharmacological reprogramming of cells may benefit and advance regenerative medicine. The established pharmacological tools have already been applied to enhance the processes of cellular reprogramming and improve the quality of cells for their clinical applications. The rapidly increasing number of readily available bioactive chemical tools will fuel our efforts to reprogram cells for transplantation therapies.",

        "abstract": "Proceedings: AACR 106th Annual Meeting 2015; April 18-22, 2015; Philadelphia, PAINTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES:Androgen receptor signaling is the key driving force in prostate cancer progression, even in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). SD70, a competitive inhibitor of KDM4 class of histone demethylases, was demonstrated to have significant inhibitory effect on AR transactivation function in LNCaP cells and androgen-insensitive basal activity in CWR22Rv1. In-vitro assessment of efficacy in CWR22Rv1 cells demonstrated cytotoxity at 5 \u03bcM. We aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of SD70 in CRPC cell lines, determine its effect in conjunction with currently approved therapies, and identify a useful biomarker for this novel drug.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Using MTT viability assays, we first assessed SD70 dosing against two CRPC lines (C42B and GRP), then against C42B drug-resistant strains (abiratarone, enzalutamide, abi+enza, docetaxel). For the resistant lines, cells were then treated with 1 \u03bcM SD70 in combination with 10 \u03bcM abiratarone, 10 \u03bcM enzalutamide or 1 nM docetaxel. In vivo drug study was conducted with mouse xenograft models (3 million CWR22Rv1 cells via s.c. injection) in athymic nude mice. When the tumor volume reached 100 mm3, animals were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg/kg SD70 or vehicle via i.p. injection daily. Tumor monitoring was continued until tumor burden exceeded humane endpoint limits indicated by IACUC.RESULTS:SD70 demonstrated complete cytotoxic response at 5 \u03bcM against C42B and GRP cell lines; IC50 was 2.1 \u03bcM and 2.9 \u03bcM, respectively. All drug-resistant C42B cell lines were responsive to SD70 treatment; IC50 ranged from 0.90-1.57 \u03bcM. SD70 was found to be synergistic with abiratarone, enzalutamide, and docetaxel against drug-resistant C42B and GRP cell lines. In the CWR22Rv1 mouse xenograft model, SD70-treated mice demonstrated significantly lower tumor volume at the end of treatment period (SD70: 507.31\u00b1203.72 mm3, control: 2388.01\u00b1543.58 mm3); no significant drug toxicity was observed. Expression of AR surrogate markers (PSA, KLK2, TMPRSS2) were diminished in C42B and enzalutamide-resistant C42B lines treated with SD70. No changes in autophagy reporter LC-3 or activation of Akt was observed.CONCLUSIONS:SD70 demonstrates promising cytotoxic efficacy against CRPC cells lines in vitro, and appears to have a synergistic effect with currently approved CRPC medications (docetaxel, enzalutamide, and abiratarone) in drug-resistant CRPC lines. Initial in vivo trial demonstrated excellent efficacy against CWR22Rv1 without significant toxicity. Ongoing evaluation into identifying biomarkers will allow for further evaluation of this promising new agent.Citation Format: Thenappan Chandrasekar, Joy C. Yang, Min Xie, Sheng Ding, Michael G.

        "abstract": "It has been suggested that tumor re-growth, as well as chemotherapy resistance and metastasis, are dependent on a small sub-population of cancer cells within the tumor that are thought to represent cancer stem cells (CSCs), i.e. self-renewing cells with pluripotent potential and tumor forming ability. We and others have shown that putative ovarian CSCs are in a transitional phase between epithelial and mesenchymal cell stages and that considerable plasticity exists between non-CSCs and CSCs. These transitions are based on epigenetic changes involving either epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or the reverse process mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Here we report that primary ovarian cancer cells treated with the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin undergo partial EMT/MET-like changes in culture and in xenograft tumors. Concurrently with the induction of partial EMT/MET, cisplatin treatment of primary ovarian cancer cells enriched for CSCs that were positive for the stem cell markers Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, indicating that the formation of CSC involves partial EMT/MET-like events. In vivo cisplatin treatment of mice with xenograft tumors showed an increase in Nanog and E-cadherin expression as well as in MAPK signaling. Notably, MET initiates and is required for the nuclear reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells indicating similarities in the formation of iPS cells and CSCs. We therefore screened 30 compounds from a library of small molecules, which has previously been generated to study EMT/MET signaling in iPS cells. We identified compounds (e.g. compound GHDM1516) that blocked EMT and the formation of CSCs in primary ovarian cancer cultures. Co-treatment of cancer cells with GHDM1516 significantly increased cisplatin induced apoptosis/necrosis in CSCs as assessed by flow cytometry for Annexin V/7-AAD. In contrast, compounds that promoted MET (e.g. compound SD83) acted synergistically with cisplatin and increased the number of CSCs and cisplatin-resistant cancer cells. We are currently performing in vivo studies with a combination GHDM1516 and cisplatin in xenograft models of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, a \u201cwound healing\u201d, functional EMT assays showed the EMT inhibitory potential of GHDM1516 after treatment of ovarian cancer cells with other chemotherapy drugs such as Paclitaxel and Etoposide. Our findings suggest that similarities in iPS and CSC formation can be exploited to find new cancer treatments that are targeted towards CSCs. Our data indicate that it might be possible to sensitize late stage tumors to chemotherapy by interfering with pathways that are involved in the formation and maintenance of CSCs.",

        "abstract": "This study was to determine if there was any temporomandibular joint (TMJ) indicator that was not statistically different in the controls but was with statistical difference between the bilateral sides in patients with unilateral TMJ complaints using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).TMJ CBCT images of 123 patients were used to preliminarily determine the indicators suitable for the measuring method. TMJ CBCT image reconstruction was performed and 19 indicators were measured. Thirty-six patients without TMJ complaint were used as controls. These bilateral TMJs were analyzed by paired t test to find out the indicators without statistical significance in the control group. Fifty patients with TMJ complaints unilaterally were used to determine the indicators that showed no statistical difference in the control group and showed statistical difference in the unilateral TMJ complaints group.All measured values showed no difference statistically in the control group, except the radius value. In the group of unilateral TMJ complaints, sagittal 60\u00b0 joint space was statistically different (P\u200a<\u200a0.05); parallel 120\u00b0 and sagittal 90\u00b0 joint space were significantly different (P\u200a<\u200a0.01); the rest of the measured values proved to be of no statistical difference.Sagittal 60\u00b0 joint space, parallel 120\u00b0, and sagittal 90\u00b0 joint space were suggested to be the indicators with statistical difference between symptomatic side and asymptomatic side in patients with unilateral TMJ complaints. Comparing with the asymptomatic side, there is a significant joint space increase in symptomatic side in the patients with unilateral TMJ complaint.",

Coverage and nonresponse errors were the primary reasons for underreporting in the SHR, with some agencies not participating or failing to submit some monthly reports. Measurement errors were the primary source of underreporting in the NVSS. If police involvement was not mentioned on death certificate, the death was misclassified as a civilian homicide.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. The results showed that the dosage of sufentanil and propofol decreased significantly in the experimental group (P<0.05). The price-henry pain scores of 10min, 1H and 6h in the experimental group were significantly reduced after the operation. At the same time, there were 3 cases (4.28%) of postoperative delirium in the experimental group, which were significantly less than 12 cases (17.14%) in the control group. The dosage of propofol in the operation is a risk factor for postoperative delirium. Dexmedetomidin can significantly reduce the amount of propofol in the operation and it has a neuroprotective effect, which can reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in the elderly. In the elderly patients with hip surgery, its adjuvant to general anesthesia can effectively reduce narcotic drug dosage and reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium.",

While the contagious spread of terrorism has also been a policy concern, few empirical studies exist on the extent to which terrorism spreads contagiously. This article uses methods developed by criminologists to study the spread of crime to examine the worldwide diffusion of terrorism from 1970 to 2013. We distinguish between contagious increases (based on shared borders) and non-contagious increases (where no borders are shared). We define the \u201cdomino effect\u201d as a particular type of contagious diffusion where high levels of terrorism spread to an adjoining country but also remain high in the host country. Our analysis shows that both contagious and non-contagious diffusion has been rare over the past 43\u00a0years, non-contagious diffusion is more common than contagious, and when contagious diffusion occurs, it is very likely to occur according to the domin...",

This time series dataset enabled us to identify important hubs and connections of gene expressions. We highlighted the analysis on phytohormone signaling pathways and their possible cross-talks. Differential expressions were also found among those genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In general, the salt-treated seedlings slowed down their photosynthetic functions and ramped up sugar catabolism to provide extra energy for survival. Primary nitrogen assimilation was shut down while nitrogen resources were redistributed. Overall, the results from the transcriptomic analyses indicate that the plant uses a multi-pronged approach to overcome salt stress, with both fast-acting, immediate physiological responses and longer-term reactions that may involve metabolic adjustment.",

The analytical power of the W05 genome is demonstrated by several examples. First, we identify an inversion at the locus determining seed coat color during domestication. Second, a translocation event between chromosomes 11 and 13 of some genotypes is shown to interfere with the assignment of QTLs. Third, we find a region containing copy number variations of the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI) genes. Such findings illustrate the power of this assembly in the analysis of large structural variations in soybean germplasm collections. The wild soybean genome assembly has wide applications in comparative genomic and evolutionary studies, as well as in crop breeding and improvement programs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Cu65Fe35 (wt.%) composite coatings with a liquid miscibility gap were produced on the different substrates by laser induction hybrid cladding (LIHC) to investigate the effect of substrate types on the microstructure and properties. The microstructure of composite coating on Fe-substrate is characterized by Cu-rich particles embedded in Fe-rich layer and Fe-rich particles dispersed in Cu-rich layer, resulting in Cu p /Fe-Fe p /Cu \u201cduplex-layer structure\u201d. When Cu-substrate is adopted, the interlayer is Fe-rich layer where Cu-rich particles are distributed, and is enveloped by the upper and lower Cu-rich layers where Fe-rich particles are embedded dispersedly, resulting in Fe p /Cu-Cu p /Fe-Fe p /Cu \u201csandwich-layer structure\u201d. Moreover, the composite coating on Fe-substrate presents the characteristic of \u201cduplex-microhardness\u201d, which is composed of Fe-rich layer with higher microhardness and Cu-rich layer with lower microhardness. The composite coating on Cu-substrate presents the characteristic of \u201csandwich-microhardness\u201d, which is composed of Fe-rich interlayer with higher microhardness, lower and upper Cu-rich layer with lower microhardness. With increasing distance from the interface of coating/substrate, the microhardness of heat-affected-zone (HAZ) in Fe-substrate decreases, while that of HAZ in Cu-substrate decreases first and then increases. The electrochemical resistance of composite coating on Fe-substrate is higher than that of composite coating on Cu-substrate, Brass, and middle carbon steel (MCS).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to improve the homogeneity of spherical Fe-rich particles within the Cu-rich matrix, the Cu95Fe5 (wt%) immiscible composite coating has been produced by the combination of mechanical alloying and laser cladding. The results show that the milled composite powder presents a polygonal morphology and is mainly composed of face-centered-cubic (fcc)-Cu solid solution. The demixing or delimitation is eliminated in the immiscible composite coating produced by laser cladding and large amounts of spherical \u03b1-Fe particles are dispersed within the e-Cu matrix as a result of liquid phase separation (LPS). The size of the Fe-rich particles measured is in radius of \u223c1.5\u00a0\u03bcm, which is much smaller than the calculated critical radius (\u223c2.3\u00a0\u03bcm), confirming that the \u03b1-Fe particles containing a supersaturated Cu are driven by the dominant mechanism of Marangoni motion. Compared to Brass, the immiscible composite coating exhibits the improved homogeneous microhardness (153HV 0.2 ) and higher corrosion resistance, as well as a saturated magnetization of \u223c9.19 emu/g and low coercivity of \u223c9.25\u00a0Oe.",

The duplex structure of immiscible composites was composed of many Fe-rich particles dispersed within Cu-rich upper layer and large amounts of Cu-rich particles embedded within Fe-rich lower layer. However, the increasing Si addition not only induced the precipitation of intermetallic compound Cu 6.69 Si within Cu-rich upper layer, but also increased the area of Fe-rich layer, the size of Fe- and Cu-rich particles, as well as the solubility of Si in Fe- and Cu-rich phases. Moreover, the microhardness of Fe- and Cu-rich layers was increased to 747.3HV 0.2  and 302.6HV 0.2  in the Cu 55.2 (FeCrC) 36.8 Si 8  immiscible composite, respectively, which was \u223c1.6 and \u223c1.8 times higher than that in the Cu 58.2 (FeCrC) 38.8 Si 3  immiscible composite, due to solid-solution strengthening and dispersion strengthening.

Here, power-system day-ahead dynamic economic dispatch with integrated wind power is studied. The MCO method is introduced to decouple the scenarios and collaboratively optimise the multiple scenarios to deal with the uncertainty of wind-power generation. Based on this, the dynamic economic-dispatch problem is divided into a system-level model and multiple subdisciplinary optimisation models for the forecasting and error scenarios. A dynamic relaxation algorithm is then introduced to solve the system-level optimisation model. The decoupled subdisciplinary models for the error scenarios are solved by a grid-computation tool in parallel, which greatly improves computational efficiency. Finally, the established model and its corresponding solution method are applied to a 10-machine, 39-bus test system. It is shown that the proposed MCO-based dynamic economic dispatching method performs much better in high-dimensional scenarios, which are the inherent limitations of the traditional centralised multi-scenario method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   With the development of the active distribution system (ADS) and multi-microgrids (MGs), increasing numbers of distributed energy resources are connected to distribution networks (DNs) using MGs. The competition between DN and MGs brings a huge challenge to efficient power system dispatching. For the strong decentralized and autonomous characteristic of ADS, this paper proposes an autonomous optimization model of the active distribution system with MGs based on analytical target cascading theory (ATC). DNs and MGs are regarded as topics of different interest. Based on their detailed models, ATC theory is proposed to decouple the dispatching of DNs and MGs by modeling the tie-line flow as a pseudo-generator/load, so that MGs and DNs can autonomously utilize their distinct resources to optimize their operation and economic benefits. Various uncertain factors are also considered by using chance-constrained programming. A modified IEEE 33 system and an actual regional DN are studied to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic economic dispatching of power system connected with multiple wind farms is a typical stochastic programming problem. How to model the randomness of wind power and how to solve this complex stochastic optimization problem are the key points. In this paper, copula theory is used to formulate the correlation of multiwind farms generation. Then, the dynamic economic dispatching model is founded with the fuel consumption, gas pollution emission fees, and electricity purchase costs as the optimized objective. The two-stage compensation algorithm is then introduced to solve the dispatching problem. In this algorithm, the conventional (nonstochastic) decision variables and stochastic variables are decoupled, which separate the dynamic dispatching model into two stage modes. The optimal dispatching result is worked out by iteration between the two stage models. Case studies on IEEE118-bus system and an actual provincial power grid show that the proposed algorithm can drastically reduce computational burden, and satisfy the actual requirements of engineering practice.",

In this paper, risk consequences calculation is introduced to large-scale power grid dispatching operation. For the various operation steps in dispatching order, the concepts of operation state and operation developing state are put forward, and corresponding calculation model is established. In terms of assessment indices, an index system including heavy-load, power limit exceeding of control section, voltage violation and loss of load is used to describe power grid dispatching operation risk. On this basis, normalization and commensurability are applied to evaluate the risk consequences of each operation step and of the whole dispatching order. Finally, the proposed model is used to assess operation risk of Guangdong Power Grid. The results show that the proposed model is suitable for real large-scale power grid. During risk assessment, high-risk operation steps of the dispatching order can be found out, which provides an efficient identification method to discover potential risk from formulating dispatching order at the beginning of power grid dispatching. It is showed that this proposed model can lay an important theoretical foundation for the dispatching operation risk assessment system in the future.

        "abstract": "For large power systems with huge proportions of industrial loads, dynamic var sources (DVSs) such as STATCOMs and generators provide significant protection against short-term voltage instability. Simultaneously optimizing the locations and capacities of STATCOMs and the settings for adjustment coefficients of generator excitation systems is a goal of this paper; thus, we formulate a multi-objective, mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MOMIDO) model subject to short-term voltage security and rotor-angle stability under multiple contingencies. We also present a reduced convex relaxation (RCR) method to handle STATCOM locations (which are integer variables) and to avoid their combinatorial explosion, and convert the MOMIDO model into a multi-objective nonlinear programming problem via Radau collocation. To obtain complete Pareto optimal solutions for the MOMIDO model, we propose a reduced wide normalized normal constraint (RWNNC) method by enlarging the Utopia plane so that the Pareto optimal solutions are covered completely by its vertical projection, while pruning redundant sections on the Utopia plane to reduce the amount of calculations. Moreover, the simulation results on an IEEE standard 39-bus system and a real provincial power system demonstrate that the proposed method can handle integer variables effectively and obtain complete Pareto optimal solutions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a radio front end for future 5G mobile devices and present the design and verification of two fundamental voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO) working at potential 5G carrier frequencies. Based on two types of very small on-chip inductors with high quality factor, two LC-VCOs are fabricated and tested in a 130nm CMOS process. With a C-shaped on-chip inductor, VCO 1 achieves a frequency range from 25.23 to 27 GHz, while VCO 2 can be continuously tuned from 39.6 to 41.8 GHz by using a very small horseshoe-shaped on-chip inductor. The measured phase noise for VCO 1 and VCO 2 are \u2212101.9 dBc/Hz and \u221294.8 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset when working at 25.58 GHz and 41.81 GHz respectively, which correspond to FOM of \u2212176.7 dBc/Hz and \u2212172.1 dBc/Hz.",

The results indicate that the optical band gap decreases and that the Vickers hardness increases with increasing Sb content. Meanwhile, Raman spectra were measured before the femtosecond laser ablation experiment, suggesting a rise in average bond energy in the six glass samples with increasing Sb concentration. Ablation of the sample disks in air were performed with high repetition rate ultrashort laser pulses (150 fs, 1 kHz) at different wavelengths (2.86 and 4 \u03bcm) to investigate how the water peak absorption coefficient affects ablation thresholds, which reveals the dominating role of the multiphoton ionization (MPI) progress on the ablation threshold fluence.

Effects of changes in laser wavelength ( \u03bb ), pulse number, power, and irradiation time on grating periodicity were studied. Regular groove-like ripples and distinct parallel submicron periodic gratings were seen in damaged areas. The damage grating period ( \u039b ) is approximately  \u03bb /2 n . The period increases with wavelength but is hardly influenced by irradiation time and pulse number. Samples with high refractive index and low bandgap are more prone to melting, and edge stripes are not obvious.",

To determine true allelochemicals and their autotoxic effects, seven compounds were isolated and identified from  sampled rhizosphere soil of cultivated . Of these; costunolide (), dehydrocostus lactone () and scopoletin () showed significant inhibition on seedling growth in a concentration-dependent manner. Detection and observation demonstrated that the antioxidase system was found to be affected by these chemicals, resulting in the accumulation of ROS and membrane damage. To investigate their release ways, the compounds were traced back and volumes quantified in rhizosphere soil and plant tissues. This work made clear the chemical bases and their physiological effects on the plants. These chemicals were found to be the secondary metabolites of the plants and included in the rhizosphere soil. The findings identified a potential pathway of plant-plant interactions, which provided theoretical basis to overcoming replanting problems. This research was also useful for exploring ecological effects of allelochemicals in green agriculture.",

The yield ratio of codonopilate A in dried soil was calculated as 2.04 \u03bcg/g. Other two triterpenoids, taraxeryl acetate (2) and 24-methylenecycloartanol (3), were isolated and identified as well showing weaker autotoxity. This was the first time that the potential allelochemicals and autotoxins in the cultivated soil of Codonopsis pilosula were reported. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by the autotoxins in the root tips of Codonopsis pilosula was considered as an important factor for the phytotoxic effect. This work systematically investigates the allelopathic and autotoxic effect of Codonopsis pilosula, and the preliminary autotoxic action mode of the three autotoxins. These findings are helpful to understand the molecular mechanism of autotoxicity and conducive to explore proper ways to degrade the autotoxins and eliminate the replanting problems of Codonopsis pilosula.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Weeds bring severe threats to agricultural production and most traditional herbicides cause serious pollution to the environment. Caffeic acid is a potential allelochemical of many crops. To develop novel herbicides, a series of  trans -caffeic acid analogues were prepared to evaluate their growth inhibition on  S. viridis  and investigate structure-activity relationships. Presence of hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring greatly reduced the phytotoxicity of analogues and the double bond seemed not to be necessary. Moreover, it was found that halogenated cinnamic acid analogues showed potent inhibitory activity. 4-Fluorocinnamic acid (4-FCA) displayed the strongest growth inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas it induced significantly weaker inhibition on wheat. This selectivity could help us to develop a novel herbicide. Exposure of  S. viridis  to 4-FCA increased levels of H 2 O 2  and catalase (CAT) in roots, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of 4-FCA might be related to oxidative stress. Thus, we have found an active lead compound for a novel herbicide derived from crop allelochemicals, which may help in the development of new environmentally safe herbicides.",

Bioassays showed that chrysophanol ( 1 ), benzofuran ( 6 ) and protocatechuic aldehyde ( 8 ) obviously inhibited the seedling growth of  P. ternate  and  Raphanus sativus  in a concentration-dependent manner. The isolated compounds were further confirmed and quantified by HPLC in the rhizosphere soil and tissues of  P. ternate , and the origins of the allelochemicals being released into the soil environment were also investigated. Physiological analyses demonstrated that the allelochemicals evidently affected the levels of protective enzymes in the tested plant seedlings and caused membrane damage, which resulted in the reduction of cell vitality. These findings provide allelopathic evidence for the replanting problems of  P. ternate  and would be helpful for assessing plant-soil interactions.",

However, the phytotoxicity mechanism of artemisinin is not exhaustively deciphered up to now. In this research, the effects of artemisinin on Arabidopsis thaliana root gravitropic curvature and development were characterized. Exogenously applied artemisinin disturb the root gravitropic responses, inhibited the elongation of primary and lateral roots and root hairs in a concentration-dependent fashion, and prevented the formation of lateral roots and root hairs. Moreover, the number of starch grain and the distribution range of auxin in the root tip was reduced by artemisinin, and the redistribution of auxin was less sensitive to gravity stimulus when treated with artemisinin than that of control. The expression of auxin transporter PIN2 was partially suppressed by artemisinin. Together, the results demonstrated that the effects of artemisinin on root gravitropism and root system development were largely dependent on the reduction of starch grain and auxin levels, as well as the disordered lateral auxin redistribution.",

        "abstract": "Natural pesticides are the subject of growing interest, as the overuse of synthetic pesticides severely threatens the safety of humans and the eco-environment. Allelopathic plants can release plentiful secondary metabolites as natural plant growth regulators to affect the growth of neighboring plants. Bio-guided isolation of the aerial waste part of typical allelopathic plant-Codonopsis pilosula led to six active compounds being produced, including ginsenoside Rg1 (1), ginsenoside Re (2), luteolin (3), luteolin-5-O-glucoside (4), ginsenoside Rb1 (5) and lobetyolin (6). Ginsenosides and luteolin-5-O-glucoside were firstly found in Codonopsis. Phyto-activity tests showed that all compounds showed inhibiting effects toward C. pilosula, and compounds 2, 4, 5 and 6 were also inhibitors of Amaranthus retroflexus. By contrast, the compounds promoted the seedling growth of wheat, rice and Setaria viridis. At certain concentrations, compounds 1, 4, 5 and 1, 2, 4 could observably promote the growth of wheat and rice seedlings, respectively, exceeding Setaria viridis. The different effects toward the two weeds might be related to the different ROS levels induced by the compounds. The ROS amounts in the root tips of S. viridis were as low as those in the control test, and the ROS content in the root tips increased with aggravation of the inhibition effect. In summary, successful isolation of phyto-selective chemicals from allelopathic plants may provide a promising method for natural herbicide screening. The compounds isolated could potentially be applied as inhibitors of dicotyledon weeds and promoters of monocotyledon crops for weed management in agriculture.",

        "abstract": "Allelochemicals are the media of allelopathy and form the chemical bases of plant-environment interactions. To determine true allelochemicals and their autotoxic effects, seven compounds were isolated and identified from in-situ sampled rhizosphere soil of cultivated Saussurea lappa. Of these; costunolide (2), dehydrocostus lactone (3) and scopoletin (4) showed significant inhibition on seedling growth in a concentration-dependent manner. Detection and observation demonstrated that the antioxidase system was found to be affected by these chemicals, resulting in the accumulation of ROS and membrane damage. To investigate their release ways, the compounds were traced back and volumes quantified in rhizosphere soil and plant tissues. This work made clear the chemical bases and their physiological effects on the plants. These chemicals were found to be the secondary metabolites of the plants and included in the rhizosphere soil. The findings identified a potential pathway of plant-plant interactions, which provided theoretical basis to overcoming replanting problems. This research was also useful for exploring ecological effects of allelochemicals in green agriculture.",

        "abstract": "The NALP3 inflammasome interacts with various immune and cell metabolic pathways and may participate in pulmonary fibrosis. However, little is known on its regulatory mechanism with respect to collagen synthesis. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether NALP3 inflammasome activation is involved in H2O2\u2011mediated collagen synthesis, in addition to examining the possible cell signaling mechanisms underlying this effect. It was demonstrated that the NF\u2011\u03baB signaling pathway was activated under conditions of H2O2\u2011mediated oxidative stress in NIH\u20113T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts. H2O2\u2011exposed fibroblasts exhibited activated NALP3 inflammasomes via increased NALP3, apoptosis\u2011associated Speck\u2011like protein and caspase\u20111 expression and the secretion of interleukin\u20111\u03b2. H2O2 also elevated \u03b1\u2011SMA and type\u00a0I collagen expression. In\u00a0vitro silencing of NALP3 attenuated the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and decreased the synthesis of type\u00a0I collagen. Furthermore, the NALP3 inflammasome was found to be activated in bleomycin\u2011induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, and this activation was relieved by a nuclear factor (NF)\u2011\u03baB inhibitor. Taken together, these findings indicate that the NALP3 inflammasome is involved in H2O2\u2011induced type\u00a0I collagen synthesis, which is mediated by the NF\u2011\u03baB signaling pathway. Additionally, the NALP3 inflammasome contributes to the development of bleomycin\u2011induced pulmonary fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Vibrational autoionization of Rydberg states provides key information about nonadiabatic processes above an ionization threshold. We employed time-of-flight mass detection of CHSH to record vibrational-state selective photo-ionization efficiency (PIE) spectra of jet-cooled methanethiol (CHSH) on exciting CHSH to a specific vibrationally excited state with an infrared (IR) laser, followed by excitation with a tunable laser in the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) region for ionization. Autoionizing Rydberg states assigned to the ns, np, nd and nf series are identified. When IR light at 2601 (\u03bd, SH stretching mode) and 2948 cm (\u03bd, CH symmetric stretching mode) was employed, the Rydberg series converged to the respective vibrationally excited (\u03bd and \u03bd) states of CHSH. When IR light at 3014 cm (overlapped \u03bd/\u03bd, CH antisymmetric stretching and CH antisymmetric stretching modes) was employed, Rydberg series converging to two vibrationally excited states (\u03bd and \u03bd) of CHSH were observed. When IR light at 2867 cm (2\u03bd, overtone of CH deformation mode) and 2892 cm (2\u03bd, overtone of CH scissoring mode) was employed, both \u0394\u03bd = -1 and \u0394\u03bd = -2 ionization transitions were observed; there is evidence for direct ionization from the initial state into the CHSH (\u03bd = 1) continuum. In all observed IR-VUV-PIE spectra, the ns and nd series show intensity greater than the other Rydberg series, which is consistent with the fact that the highest-occupied molecular orbital of CHSH is a p-like lone pair orbital on the S atom. The quantum yields for autoionization of various vibrational excited states are discussed. Values of \u03bd = 3035, \u03bd = 2884, \u03bd = 2514, and \u03bd = 2936 cm for CHSH derived from the converged limits agree satisfactorily with values observed for Ar-tagged CHSH at 3026, 2879, 2502, and 2933 cm.",

        "abstract": "Three-electron two-center (3e-2c) hemi-bonds play important roles in the oxidation and electron transport of proteins and are implicated to be involved in some neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous investigations on infrared (IR) spectra of (CH3SH)2+ using vacuum-ultraviolet photoionization, infrared dissociation, and time-of-flight detection have shown that (CH3SH)2+ is (3e-2c)-bonded. To investigate the influence of the solvent molecules on the (3e-2c)-bonded (CH3SH)2+ in a supersonic jet, we added H2O or (CH3)2CO or NH3 or (CH3SH)n (n = 1-4) to (CH3SH)2+ and investigated their IR action spectra. The (3e-2c)-bonded (CH3SH)2+ ion core was maintained when a molecule of H2O or (CH3)2CO or CH3SH binds, indicating that the ion core is more stable than the hydrogen bond, whereas the (3e-2c)-bond became broken by a NH3 molecule because the proton transfer led to a more stable hydrogen-bonded structure. The spectral features of the SH-stretching modes of (CH3SH)n+ (n = 3-6) indicate that the (3e-2c)-bonded (CH3SH)2+ ion core is maintained and the first two additional CH3SH are H-bonded to the free SH groups of the ion core. For larger clusters with n = 5 and 6, the additional solvent molecules likely bind to the first solvation shell. These results show also that the (3e-2c)-bonded S\u2234S structure is more stable than the S\u2234O and S\u2234N structures in [(CH3SH)2-X]+ with X = H2O or (CH3)2CO or CH3SH or NH3.",

All-trans and gauche-involving conformers are identified for these cations by comparisons of observed infrared spectra and vibrational simulations. Intense CH stretch bands are observed in the frequency region lower than the normal alkyl CH stretch frequency. These low frequencies and high intensities of the CH stretch bands are caused by the CH bond weakening and the enhanced positive charge of the hydrogen atoms through the delocalization of the \u03c3 electron in the CH bonds. These effects of the delocalization of the \u03c3 electron result in the enhanced acidity of the CH bonds. The conformation as well as alkyl chain length dependence of the acidity of the CH bonds is demonstrated by the CH stretch frequency shift trend. ",

The vertically-ionized DEE dimer isomerizes to a hydrogen-bonded cluster of protonated DEE and the [DEE-H] radical through barrierless intermolecular proton transfer from the CH bond of the ionized moiety. This isomerization process is confirmed by IR spectroscopy and the theoretical reaction path search. The multiple dissociation pathways following the isomerization are analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. The isomerized cluster dissociates stepwise into a [protonated DEE-acetaldehyde (AA)] cluster, protonated DEE, and protonated AA. The structure of the fragment ion is also analyzed by IR spectroscopy. The reaction map of the multistage processes is revealed through a harmony of these experimental and theoretical methods.",

In the neutral state, both the THF and THP dimers tend to form the stacking structures bound essentially by dispersion. After ionization, both of these dimer cations form the proton transferred structures, in which the proton of the C\u03b1H bond is intermolecularly transferred and shared between the oxygen atoms. Along with the pseudorotation of the five-member ring, the barrierless proton transfer from CH occurs in the ionized THF dimer, and the dimer finally forms the proton transferred structure. In the case of the THP dimer cation, the barrierless intracluster proton transfer occurs with the conformational change of the proton donor site because the acidic CH site of the THP cation strongly depends on its conformation. These isomerization processes involving proton transfer from CH are discussed based on IR ...",

        "abstract": "Network slicing is a concept to provide dedicated and isolated telco services tailored to specific needs of different verticals over a common infrastructure. Offering service assurance (SA) in network slicing implies full awareness and quick response to all frequent changes in topology, resources, function operation, service requests, and slice performance. It requires a precise coordination between all components of network slicing to facilitate efficient access, processing, and analysis of the information necessary to take right actions in an architecture that is new. To address this open issue, we study those new architectural components and propose a framework to realize network slicing SA. The framework joins the two key components of SA, monitoring and analytics, in a hierarchical and distributed way. These components coordinate at various levels to optimize the tradeoff between monitoring cost and analytics accuracy. Detailed workflows are presented to demonstrate how the framework is implemented in a modular way across different layers and domains. This framework can be used to guide the integration of diverse SA solutions into a unified SA solution.",

        "abstract": "Network Function Virtualization (NFV), as an enabler for 5G and network slicing, introduces new abstraction levels and orchestration to automate the network operations. However, such features make it challenging to assure the performance of network services provisioned with Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) timely and accurately. In this paper, we propose a joint service assurance and orchestration approach to assure the End-to-End (E2E) service in a closed loop. The joint approach integrates performance monitoring, Load Balancing (LB), data analytics, and NFV orchestration. To minimize monitoring cost, a selection discipline is designed to monitor only a subset of E2E flows. Based on a Minimum Deviation (MD) metric, the measured E2E delays are examined to detect Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation and identify the problematic VNF instance(s). The MD metrics are also used in LB that continuously adjusts the traffic load assigned to each flow as a proactive way of preventing delay degradation as early as possible. Furthermore, now that the faulty VNF instances are identified, the orchestrator can take corrective actions such as VNF migration to restore the E2E service performance as quickly as possible. A series of simulations are run to verify the efficiency of the proposed joint approach.",

Despite the fact that the Chrome statistics have a number of limitations, our observations indicate that they are useful for QoE research when these limitations are known and carefully handled when performing post-processing analysis. The results from our initial tests show that a combination of performance indicators measured at the senderu0027s and receiveru0027s end may help to identify severe video freezes (being an important QoE killer) in the context of WebRTC-based video communication.

To find out whether the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is involved in oocyte aging or not which may cause reduced female fertility, a series of biological methods was applied, including oocyte collection and culture, micro injection, RNA interference, western blotting, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, and quantitative real-time PCR.Our data demonstrated that Nrf2 depletion disrupted oocyte maturation and spindle/chromosome organization by suppressing Cyclin B1 expression. Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) depletion reduced Nrf2 expression, which indicated the existence of the Sirt1-Nrf2-Cyclin B1 signaling pathway in mouse oocytes. Additionally, immunoblotting results reflected a lower Nrf2 protein level in oocytes from aged mice, and maternal age-associated meiotic defects can be ameliorated through overexpression of Nrf2, which supported the hypothesis that decreased Nrf2 is an important factor contributing toward oocyte age-dependent de\ufb01cits. Furthermore, we show that the expression of Nrf2 is related to female age in ovarian granular cells, suggesting that the decreased expression of Nrf2 may be related to the decline in the reproductive capacity of older women.",

The effects of Brusatol on oocyte meiosis has not been addressed. In this study, we investigated the impact of Brusatol treatment on mouse oocyte maturation and its possible mechanism. Our data demonstrated that Brusatol treatment disrupted oocyte maturation and spindle/chromosome organization by modulating Nrf2-Cyclin B1 pathway, as the influence of Brusatol was compensated by the addition of Nrf2 activation plasmid, and the mRNA and protein levels of Cyclin B1 were severely reduced in oocytes following Nrf2 decline. In summary, our data support a model that Brusatol, through the inhibition of Nrf2, modulate Cyclin B1 levels, consequently disturbing proper spindle assembly and chromosome condensation in meiotic oocytes.",

The UTBB GeOI substrates exhibit superior crystal quality (similar to the bulk single crystalline Ge) and sufficiently reduced surface roughness. As a result, the Hall hole mobility of UTBB GeOI reaches 1330\u2009cm2/V\u2009s with a carrier concentration of 2 \u00d7 1016\u2009cm\u22123.

The PL intensity increases with the decrease of the Si(110) well thickness. Furthermore, when the upper SiO2 layer is removed, no PL peaks could be observed. But the luminescence is recovered when the samples were exposed to air for several months with the re-formation of Si\u2013SiO x interface, and slightly dependent of temperature. These results indicate that both of the quantum confinement effect and the interface effect play an important role in the luminescence properties of Si(110) QWs.",

Based on the direct wafer boding and polishing technique, high-performance 20-nm-thick GeOI pMOSFETs have been fabricated. Peak hole mobility of 158    $text {cm}^{text {2}}/text {V}cdot text {s}$    and high-field mobility (   ${N}_{s}= text {1} times text {10}^{text {13}}$    cm \u22122 ) of 121    $text {cm} ^{text {2}}/text {V}cdot text {s}$    are obtained, respectively. The back-gate modulation in UTB GeOI pMOSFETs has been systematically investigated by experiments and simulations. For the case that the back channel does not form, the carrier distributions in the front channel become wider with larger negative back-gate voltage    ${V}_{text {bg}}$    applied. As a result, the mobility increases because of the reduced scattering in the whole    ${N}_{s}$    range. When    ${V}_{text {bg}}$    is negative enough, the back channel forms. In this case, the modulation effect would be strongly affected by the carrier transport properties at the back channel.",

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the gastroprotective effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury and gastric epithelial cells injury. Rats were divided into the control group, vehicle group and GABA-treated groups (10, 20 and 40\u00a0mg/kg/day). After GABA ingestion for 14 days, rats except the control group were given 1\u00a0mL pure ethanol by oral gavage in order to induce acute gastric mucosal lesion. The human gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 was incubated with GABA (100, 200 and 400 \u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h, followed by treatment with 8% ethanol for 3\u00a0h to induce cell injury. The results showed that GABA pretreatment significantly reduced gastric ulcer index in a dose-dependent manner. GABA pretreatment could not only remarkably restrain oxidative stress by increasing activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase as well as decreasing content of malondialdehyde both in gastric tissue and cells, but also significantly reduced pro-inflammatory factors (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) levels in gastric tissue. In addition, significant augments of prostaglandin E and nitric oxide levels were observed in the gastric tissues of 40\u00a0mg/kg/d GABA treated group. In conclusion, the results in this study suggested that GABA could alleviate ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury and gastric epithelial cells injury through the improvement of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant status, as well as the increase of PGE and NO levels.",

        "abstract": "Gastrointestinal tract disease is a global health problem which affects a major part of the world population. In this study, the gastroprotective effects of \u03b2-glucan isolated from highland barley on ethanol-induced gastric damage in rats and its benefits to mice gut health were investigated. Biochemical and pathological analysis methods were adopted to evaluating the gastrointestinal tract protective of \u03b2-glucan isolated from highland barley. In the ulceration model, it was found that \u03b2-glucan treatment could mitigate the gastric lesions and gastric mucosal damage caused by ethanol, decrease the gastric ulcer index. Furthermore, \u03b2-glucan treatment alleviated the gastric oxidative stress injury in vehicle rats through increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase, decreasing the level of malondialdehyde. In addition, \u03b2-glucan treatment also could decrease the level of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha and increased level of prostaglandin E2, nitric oxide. In the mouse gut health promoting model, \u03b2-glucan treatment increased the colon length, faces water contents and the concentration of total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) both in mice colon and cecum. Taken together, these results may indicate that \u03b2-glucan isolated from highland barley exert protective effects on the gastrointestinal tract of laboratory rodents.",

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of GABA on colon health in mice. The female Kunming mice were given GABA at doses of 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg/d for 14 days. Afterwards, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations, pH values, colon index, colon length and weight of colonic and cecal contents were determined to evaluate the effects of GABA on colon health. The results showed that intake of GABA could increase the concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate and total SCFAs in colonic and cecal contents, as well as the weight of colonic and cecal contents. The colon index and length of the 40 mg/kg/d GABA-treated group were significantly higher than those of the control group ( < 0.05). In addition, decrease of pH values in colonic and cecal contents was also observed. These results suggest that GABA may improve colon health.",

In this study, intact algae, lichen, and moss crusts from the Gurbantunggut Desert were collected and exposed to five experimental treatments\u2014snow removal (0S), snow decrease to half that of ambient conditions (1/2S), ambient snow (S), snow increase to 1.5 times that of ambient conditions (3/2S), and snow increase to twice that of ambient conditions (2S)\u2014to evaluate the effect of snowfall on the ecophysiological parameters of the BSCs during the melt and at the end of the growing period. The results clearly identified differences in physiological and ecological indexes between snowfall manipulation treatments in March, and further found that the values of most of the ecophysiological indexes were influenced by snow removal/reduction treatments, the type of BSC and their interaction effect. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, chlorophyll content, and the rates of photosynthesis and respiration of all three types of crust declined because of decreased soil water content with decreased snow cover, and this effect would likely be even greater under conditions of decreased precipitation. The rates of photosynthesis and respiration of the main types of BSC were changed by variations in the winter snowfall, and confirmed the existence of long-term snowfall impacts on photosynthetic carbon fixation and biomass accumulation. These results provide a foundation for future studies to assess the potential effects of snowfall on the carbon sequestration of BSCs from arid and semi-arid regions.",

Bacterial diversity and richness were highest after 15 years, while those of fungi increased along a chronosequence of stabilized dunes. Hierarchical clustering and principal coordinate analysis showed significant differences in bacterial communities between biocrusts and physical crusts, whereas fungal communities clustered into four groups. Each age of BSCs exhibited the same dominant phyla at different proportions. The recovery time for bacteria was more than 15 years, whereas that for fungi ranged from decades to centuries, indicating that fungal richness might be a potential indicator for predicting the degree of BSC recovery.",

        "abstract": "For power system decision makers, they should decide a reasonable wind capacity or target penetration level considering the balance of wind curtailment, investment, system reliability and social benefit. Assessing wind curtailment under different wind capacity, considering the wind resource uncertainty, is therefore necessary for utilizing wind power effectively. In this paper, fuzzy wind capacity factor is proposed to analyze and propagate the uncertainty of wind resources based on the wind speed distribution. By investigating the maximal wind power output that can be accepted in candidate system nodes, a fuzzy linear programming problem is proposed to decide the required wind capacity considering the fuzzy wind capacity factor. Based on the cumulative distribution function of wind capacity resulting from large number of simulations, the relationship between wind capacity and wind curtailment is determined. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by its application in two power grids. The results demonstrate that the proposed model and method are capable of describing the possibilistic uncertainty of wind resources and assessing wind curtailment under different wind capacity. Compared with previous research, this method can aid power system planners to allocate wind capacity considering the possibilistic uncertainty of wind resources.",

        "abstract": "Wind parks always produce diverse percentages of their nominal power at the same time, leading to a concern about correlation between wind speeds. The assessments of wind speed correlation have been particularly focused on probabilistic modeling of aleatory uncertainty. However, poor historical data, imprecise parameter estimation and incomplete knowledge of wind speeds lead to another type of uncertainty, possibilistic uncertainty, which requires an explicit analysis. Therefore, a fuzzy copula model is firstly proposed to express the possibilistic uncertainty of wind speed correlation. The advantage of the proposed model is that the copula parameters can be interval numbers, triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers based on the wind speed data and subjective judgment of decision makers. For estimating copula parameters, a complete decision rule and interval estimation method is developed based on cumulative probability and probability distributions of correlated wind speeds. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by the application in wind curtailment evaluation while a method is developed to evaluate and quantify wind curtailment in a hybrid power system involving different types of generation. The results demonstrate that the proposed model and method are capable of describing the possibilistic uncertainty and evaluating its effect on wind curtailment. Compared with previous research, the proposed model develops a new universal parameter estimation method and selection rule to provide more interval results, by calculating the membership function of copula parameters and wind curtailment. System planners and operators can apply the fuzzy results to various topics like reserve capacity evaluation or real-time dispatch depending on their level of risk tolerance.",

        "abstract": "In conventional supplier selection approaches, cost consideration is usually emphasised and it renders a vulnerable supply chain with various risks. This article aims to develop a quantitative approach for modelling both supply chain operational risks and disruption risks to support decision-making with regard to order allocation and risk mitigation. We introduce two types of risk evaluation models: value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Specifically, VaR is used to measure operational risks caused by improper selection and operations of a supplier portfolio to the stochastic demand, which may frequently occur but result in relatively small losses to supply chains; CVaR is used to evaluate disruption risks that are less frequent and tend to cause significant damage. After incorporating risk factors into a probability-based multi-criteria optimisation model, different methods and parameters are compared and tested to determine the factors that may influence the supplier selection process. Computational examples by simulation are presented to illustrate the approach and how decision-makers make trade-offs between costs and hybrid risks.",

The system consists of N+1 linearly ordered positions (nodes) and fails if the first node (source) is not connected with the final node (sink). The reliability of an LMCCS has been studied in the past but has been restricted to the case when each system element has a constant reliability. In practice, system elements usually fail with increasing failure probability due to aging effects. Furthermore, in order to increase system availability, resources can be put into the maintenance of each element to increase the availability of the element. In this article, a framework is proposed to solve the cost optimal maintenance and allocation strategy of this type of system subject to an availability requirement. A universal generating function is used to estimate the availability of the system. A genetic algorithm is adopted for optimization. Illustrative examples are presented. \u00a9 2012 \"IIE\".",

The BMUF consists of an information integration framework and the corresponding Bayesian reliability models. The information generated throughout the life cycle stages is integrated and transited stage by stage. The Bayesian reliability model in each life cycle stage can combine the outputs of previous models and the subjective information obtained in the previous stage with the field data in the present stage. The novel features of the BMUF are the natural manner in which the life cycle of the product is handled in multiple stages. The reliability estimation model for the product is updating with more information available and the estimation results are getting more precise with the information transition and integration.

Maintenance activities play an important role in ensuring that the system works properly when considering the degraded components.

In this paper, a time-varying model is proposed to capture the features of degraded components and inner control system. The degradation of component takes into account the unit-to-unit variability. The condition-based maintenance is determined by the real-time performance of degraded control system which is evaluated at inspection times. Monte Carlo Simulation method is introduced to estimate the parameters of the maintenance model and long run cost rate is obtained.

The efficiency of EWMA chart in monitoring location parameter can be improved by using an auxiliary variable that is closely related to the variable of interest. In this paper, an EWMA-type scheme using ratio estimator is developed to further increase the effectiveness of the classical EWMA chart in monitoring the location parameter.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Manufacturers usually want to predict the warranty cost for new products under affordable maintenance policies. With insufficient reliability information, experimental degradation tests are commonly conducted to predict the field reliability before the products are put on the market. In this paper, we propose a novel warranty cost optimization framework based on degradation data within a finite warranty period under the assumption of imperfect repairs. The expected number of warranty claims is given in the analytical form. Two sources of uncertainty are considered to estimate the field reliability for more realistic warranty cost prediction: the uncertainty in experimental data and the variation in field conditions. Effects of imperfect repairs are assumed to be random. The warranty cost for a single repair is assumed to be associated with the improvement factor of imperfect repairs. Optimal imperfect repair policy is obtained by minimizing the expected warranty cost for each sold product. Further, the proposed framework can facilitate the interval prediction for warranty cost. Numerical results show that the proposed analytical method to evaluate warranty claims significantly outperforms simulation methods from the perspective of computational efforts. Finally, an application example of degradation tests along with sensitivity analysis is presented to illustrate the proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Delay in maintenance operations occurs for many systems in real engineering applications. Random delays increase the variability in maintenance modeling, making the optimization of maintenance policy more complicated. In this paper, a delayed condition-based maintenance (CBM) problem for systems under continuous monitoring is studied. The system is assumed to be affected by competing degradation failures and fatal shocks. The degradation path is modeled by a gamma process, while random fatal shocks are modeled by a non-homogeneous Poisson process, of which the failure intensity has a change point that depends on the degradation level. It is assumed that when the degradation level reaches the alarm threshold, the maintenance operation delays for a random duration of time before its implementation. The main objective here is to choose an appropriate alarm threshold to minimize the expected cost rate. We derive the asymptotic cost rate in the analytical form. The proposed modeling and decision framework are validated and illustrated by numerical examples along with sensitivity analysis. The results show the necessity to determine the distribution for delay time precisely and the framework also helps decision maker to identify the source of the cost that is most worthwhile to be controlled in practice.",

        "abstract": "Conducting a Reliability Demonstration Test (RDT) is a crucial step in production. Products are tested under certain schemes to demonstrate whether their reliability indices reach pre-specified thresholds. Test schemes for RDT have been studied in different situations, e.g., lifetime testing, degradation testing and accelerated testing. Systems designed with several structures are also investigated in many RDT plans. Despite the availability of a range of test plans for different systems, RDT planning for load-sharing systems hasn't yet received the attention it deserves. In this paper, we propose a demonstration method for two specific types of load-sharing systems with components subject to two distributions: exponential and Weibull. Based on the assumptions and interpretations made in several previous works on such load-sharing systems, we set the mean time to failure (MTTF) of the total system as the demonstration target. We represent the MTTF as a summation of mean time between successive component failures. Next, we introduce generalized test statistics for both the underlying distributions. Finally, RDT plans for the two types of systems are established on the basis of these test statistics.",

A new parallel-triggered scheme is proposed by using both the relative error and the absolute error information. The scheme can reduce transmission rate while maintaining the global asymptotical stability. The linear parallel-triggered networked control system is modeled as a time-delay system. By employing Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are established for the closed-loop system to be globally asymptotically stable in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, a co-design algorithm is developed to obtain both the optimal trigger parameters and the output feedback controller gain in the sense that the transmission rate is minimized. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the advantages of the proposed scheme.",

Since many key components of such systems follow different performance degradation paths, therefore it is important to have an approach capable of correctly estimating the performance of control systems containing a variety of degraded components. One solution is to endow an existing estimation approach to equip with a capability to cope with uncertainties and inadequate system specifications. This paper presents a hybrid model capable of improving existing approaches by applying the Laplace transform to the time-varying model of the control system while taking into account the varying behaviors of components over different time slices. Reliability is estimated through an event-based Monte Carlo simulation that does not require knowledge of the exact reliability function. System reliability is improved by using the particle swarm optimization method. The method searches for the optimal parameters of the control strategy by compensating for the loss in effectiveness caused by degraded components. The proposed approach is validated through a case study conducted on a simulated cooling system. Numerical results have shown that the proposed approach is capable of improving the reliability of control systems subject to total run time constraints.",

However, the degradation, i.e., time delay and packet dropout, that originated from the cyber layer-communication networks would deteriorate the performance of the physical layer. Hence, the internal dependence and reliability of such a complex and safety-critical systems must be analyzed. In this paper, we describe a CPS by using time-varying models of its main components and realize it in TrueTime simulator. The Monte Carlo simulation is applied to estimate the system reliability. The parameters of the discrete-time proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller are tuned to improve the performance and reliability of the CPS. Considering the controller parameters that undergo perturbation when in hardware implementation, we use particle swarm optimization to search for a robust PID controller that can ensure a satisfied control performance against parameter perturbation. An industrial heat exchanger is studied to illustrate the correctness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Digital networked control systems are of growing importance in safety-critical systems and perform indispensable function in most complex systems today. Networked degradations such as transmission delay and packet dropout cause such systems to fail to satisfy performance requirements, and eventually affect the overall reliability. It is necessary to get a model to verify and evaluate the system reliability in early design phase, prior to its implementation. However, existing probabilistic models only provide partial descriptions of such coupled networks and control system. In this paper, a new stochastic model represented by linear discrete-time approach is proposed, considering data packet transmissions in both channels: controller-to-actuator and sensor-to-controller. Different from pervious works, the historical behaviors of networked degradations are modeled by multistate Markov chains with uncertainties, releasing the assumption that faults of all periods are independent of each other. The concept of domain requirements for such systems is considered here, contributing to the integration of control and reliability engineering. Methodologies for quantitatively assessing the reliability of the single- and sequential-control goal are derived from the Monte Carlo method. An example of an industrial heat exchanger digital networked control system is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the model and method.",

In view of the inherent polymorphism of manufacturing systems (i.e., dynamic production scheduling and performance degradation), the connotation of mission reliability of equipment is defined and modeled based on the processing capacity distribution which integrates multiple fault data. Further, the relationship between mission reliability and performance of equipment is established by using the unavailability as the intermediary. The optimal predictive maintenance policy, the best mission reliability threshold for performing predictive maintenance action, is obtained by minimizing the comprehensive cost which includes processing capacity loss, corrective maintenance cost, predictive maintenance cost and indirect loss caused by failing to meet due dates over the planning period. This paper will also evaluate a manufacturing system of the cylinder head of an automotive engine as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method. The final result shows that a more significant economic benefit can be achieved by the proposed approach, which considers the mission reliability and comprehensive cost relative to the periodic preventive maintenance policy.",

In this paper, a new upgrade model is developed for complex second-hand systems sold with a non-renewing free repair/replacement warranty, by explicitly considering their multi-component configurations. Two types of components, i.e. repairable and non-repairable components, are taken into account. During the upgrade process, non-repairable components can be upgraded only by replacement (if necessary), while repairable ones may be imperfectly upgraded with various degrees.

This distribution is applicable to the situation where the test data are bounded in an interval because of test conditions, cost and other restrictions. An important property of the truncated Weibull distribution is that it can have bathtub-shaped failure rate function. In this paper, the parametric analysis and parameter estimation methods of the distribution are investigated. Both the graphical approach and the maximum likelihood estimation are considered. The applicability of this distribution to modeling lifetime data is illustrated by an example and the results of comparisons to other competitive models in modeling the given data are also presented. Moreover, the possible application of the distribution to modeling component or system failure is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Redundancy or standby is a technique that has been widely applied to improving system reliability and availability in system design. In most cases, components in standby system are assumed to be statistically identical and independent. However, in many practical applications, not all components in standby can be treated as identical because they have different failure and repair rates. In this paper, one kind of such systems with two categories of components is studied, which is named k -out-of-( M + N ):G warm standby system. In the system, one category of the components is of type 1 and the other type 2. There are M type 1 components and N type 2 components. Components of type 1 have a lower failure rate and are preferably repaired if there is one failed. There are r repair facilities available. By using Markov model, the system state transition process can be clearly illustrated, and furthermore, the solutions of system availability and reliability are obtained based on this. An example representing a power-generator and transmission system is given to illustrate the solutions of the system availability and reliability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Maintenance actions are necessary for ensuring proper operations of control systems under component degradation. However, current condition-based maintenance (CBM) models based on component health indices are not suitable for degraded control systems. Indeed, failures of control systems are only determined by the controller outputs, and the feedback mechanism compensates the control performance loss caused by the component deterioration. Thus, control systems may still operate normally even if the component health indices exceed failure thresholds. This work investigates the CBM model of control systems and employs the reduced control performance as a direct degradation measure for deciding maintenance activities. The reduced control performance depends on the underlying component degradation modelled as a Wiener process and the feedback mechanism. To this aim, the controller features are quantified by developing a dynamic and stochastic control block diagram-based simulation model, consisting of the degraded components and the control mechanism. At each inspection, the system receives a maintenance action if the control performance deterioration exceeds its preventive-maintenance or failure thresholds. Inspired by realistic cases, the component degradation model considers random start time and unit-to-unit variability. The cost analysis of maintenance model is conducted via Monte Carlo simulation. Optimal maintenance strategies are investigated to minimize the expected maintenance costs, which is a direct consequence of the control performance. The proposed framework is able to design preventive maintenance actions on a gas power plant, to ensuring required load frequency control performance against a sudden load increase. The optimization results identify the trade-off between system downtime and maintenance costs as a function of preventive maintenance thresholds and inspection frequency. Finally, the control performance-based maintenance model can reduce maintenance costs as compared to CBM and pre-scheduled maintenance.",

        "abstract": "TGFbeta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MAPKKK family, controls diverse functions ranging from innate and adaptive immune system activation to vascular development and apoptosis. To analyse the in vivo function of TAK1 in cartilage, we generated mice with a conditional deletion of Tak1 driven by the collagen 2 promoter. Tak1(col2) mice displayed severe chondrodysplasia with runting, impaired formation of secondary centres of ossification, and joint abnormalities including elbow dislocation and tarsal fusion. This phenotype resembled that of bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)1 and Gdf5-deficient mice. BMPR signalling was markedly impaired in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes as evidenced by reduced expression of known BMP target genes as well as reduced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinases. TAK1 mediates Smad1 phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence in a mammalian system that TAK1 is required for BMP signalling and functions as an upstream activating kinase for Smad1/5/8 in addition to its known role in regulating MAP kinase pathways. Our experiments reveal an essential role for TAK1 in the morphogenesis, growth, and maintenance of cartilage.",

In this study, we demonstrated adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) produced significantly lower blood glucose via promoting hepatic glycogen synthesis and inhibiting hepatic glucose production within 24\u00a0h after infusion in T2DM rats. In\u00a0vitro, HepG2 cells treated with palmitate (PA) were used as a model of hepatic glucose metabolism disorder to confirm that ASCs stimulates the phosphorylation of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to restores hepatic glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes. In summary, this study indicated that ASCs improve hyperglycemia via regulating hepatic glucose metabolism. Additionally, the effect of ASCs on hepatic glucose metabolism depended on the AMPK signaling pathway. Thus, this is the new research of the molecular mechanisms of MSCs administration to improve glucose metabolism, and it may indicate a new treatment target of MSCs in T2DM.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs), spatial item recommendation has become an important way of helping users discover interesting locations to increase their engagement with location-based services. Although human movement exhibits sequential patterns in LBSNs, most current studies on spatial item recommendations do not consider the sequential influence of locations. Leveraging sequential patterns in spatial item recommendation is, however, very challenging, considering 1) usersu0027 check-in data in LBSNs has a low sampling rate in both space and time, which renders existing prediction techniques on GPS trajectories ineffective; 2) the prediction space is extremely large, with millions of distinct locations as the next prediction target, which impedes the application of classical Markov chain models; and 3) there is no existing framework that unifies usersu0027 personal interests and the sequential influence in a principled manner. In light of the above challenges, we propose a sequential personalized spatial item recommendation framework (SPORE) which introduces a novel latent variable topic-region to model and fuse sequential influence with personal interests in the latent and exponential space. The advantages of modeling the sequential effect at the topic-region level include a significantly reduced prediction space, an effective alleviation of data sparsity and a direct expression of the semantic meaning of usersu0027 spatial activities. Furthermore, we design an asymmetric Locality Sensitive Hashing (ALSH) technique to speed up the online top-k recommendation process by extending the traditional LSH. We evaluate the performance of SPORE on two real datasets and one large-scale synthetic dataset. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in SPOREu0027s ability to recommend spatial items, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices and the dramatic proliferation of location-based social networks (LBSNs), location-based recommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive and interesting points of interest (POIs). However, extreme sparsity of user-POI matrix and cold-start issue create severe challenges, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. Moreover, location-based recommendation requires spatiotemporal context awareness and dynamic tracking of the user's latest preferences in a real-time manner.\n\nTo address these challenges, we stand on recent advances in embedding learning techniques and propose a generic graph-based embedding model, called GE, in this paper.  GE jointly captures the sequential effect, geographical influence, temporal cyclic effect and semantic effect in a unified way by embedding the four corresponding relational graphs (POI-POI,  POI-Region, POI-Time and POI-Word) into a shared low dimensional space. Then, to support real-time recommendation, we develop a novel time-decay method to dynamically compute the user's latest preferences based on the  embedding of his/her checked-in POIs learnt in the latent space. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our model on two real large-scale datasets, and the experimental results show its superiority over other competitors, especially in recommending cold-start POIs. Besides, we study the contribution of each factor to improve location-based recommendation, and find that both sequential effect and temporal cyclic effect play more important roles in users' daily life than geographical influence and semantic effect.",

In this paper, we investigate the problem of next POI recommendation by considering the sequential influences of POIs, as a natural extension of the general POI recommendation, but it is more challenging than the general POI recommendation, due to that 1 users' preferences are dynamic, and the next POI recommendation requires tracking the change of user preferences in a real-time manner; and 2 the prediction space is extremely large, with millions of distinct POIs as the next prediction target, which impedes the application of classical Markov chain models. In light of the above challenges, we propose a graph-based metric embedding model which converts POIs in a low dimensional metric and tracks the dynamics of user preferences in an efficient way. Besides, the knowledge of sequential patterns of users' check-in behaviors can be exploited and encoded in the POI embedding, which avoid the time-consuming computation of the POI-POI transition matrix or even cube as the Markov chain-based recommender models have done. In other words, our proposed method effectively unifies dynamic user preferences and sequential influence via the POI embedding.

As the concept of complexity, how to measure and what is the concrete composition of Daqi are the focus of this paper. Based on cognitive integration of Daqi, this paper puts forward the quantitative research method of human emotional experience. This method first uses the text analysis to extract the representative vocabularies as the Daqi measurement indicators. Then Professional researchers grade the stimulants of the Daqi of multiple dimensions, calculate the proportion of Daqi indicators by SPSS factor analysis, and get a formula of Daqi. Finally, this formula is tested and refined by large-scale stimulus experiments. Cognitive quantitative method of emotional experience of Daqi is different from the previous emotional behavior analysis method and more conducive to analyze the deep causes and stimulating factors of emotion, enriching the depth and breadth of the emotional experience experiment. While the quantitative formula established by the research can be applied to product and visual design, sociology research and other specific areas, playing a guiding and testing role.",

Due to the complexity of grid system, there are a lot of problems unsolved in grid reliability. To cope with the low level of grid service reliability, a fault recovery mechanism in grid resources is introduced and a more practical grid service reliability model is proposed, in which the constraints on the life numbers of subtasks and on the numbers of recoveries performed can be imposed freely by resource owners. In order to further improve grid service reliability, a redundant scheduling of grid tasks is used. Based on the proposed grid service reliability model considering fault recovery, an optimization model with a cost constraint for redundant scheduling problem is presented to maximize the grid service reliability. A genetic algorithm is developed to solve it and some special repair operators are designed to adjust the infeasible solutions of the chromosomes, which can ensure normal algorithm operation. A numerical example is given to show the efficiency of the genetic algorithm. \u00a9 2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

Motivated by practical needs, this paper investigates a Bayesian approach for system reliability assessment and prediction with multilevel heterogeneous data sets. Two major imperatives have been handled in the proposed approach, which provides a comprehensive Bayesian framework for the integration of multilevel heterogeneous data sets. In particular, the pass-fail data, lifetime data, and degradation data at different system levels are combined coherently for system reliability analysis. This approach goes beyond the alternatives that deal with solely multilevel pass-fail or lifetime data, and presents a more practical tool for real engineering applications. In addition, the indices for reliability assessment and prediction are constructed coherently within the proposed Bayesian framework. It gives rise to a natural manner of incorporating this approach into a decision-making procedure for system operation and management. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with reliability analysis of a navigation satellite.",

While much work has been done to separately estimate reliability of new products in specific stages, a gap exists in carrying out life cycle reliability assessment throughout all life cycle stages. We present a Bayesian model updating approach (BMUA) for life cycle reliability assessment of new products. Novel features of this approach are the development of Bayesian information toolkits by separately including reliability improvement factor and information fusion factor, which allow the integration of subjective information in a specific life cycle stage and the transition of integrated information between adjacent life cycle stages. They lead to the unique characteristics of the BMUA in which information generated throughout life cycle stages are integrated coherently. To illustrate the approach, an application to the life cycle reliability assessment of a newly developed Gantry Machining Center is shown. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "There has been quite some research on the development of tools and techniques for grid systems, yet some important issues, e.g., grid service reliability and task scheduling in the grid, have not been sufficiently studied. For some grid services which have large subtasks requiring time-consuming computation, the reliability of grid service could be rather low. To resolve this problem, this paper introduces Local Node Fault Recovery (LNFR) mechanism into grid systems, and presents an in-depth study on grid service reliability modeling and analysis with this kind of fault recovery. To make LNFR mechanism practical, some constraints, i.e. the life times of subtasks, and the numbers of recoveries performed in grid nodes, are introduced; and grid service reliability models under these practical constraints are developed. Based on the proposed grid service reliability model, a multi-objective task scheduling optimization model is presented, and an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is developed to solve it effectively. A numerical example is given to illustrate the influence of fault recovery on grid service reliability, and show a high efficiency of ACO in solving the grid task scheduling problem.",

        "abstract": "Diagnosability is an important parameter for evaluating the reliability of multiprocessor systems.    $t/t$   -diagnosability and    $t/k$   -diagnosability are both new indexes for measuring the reliability of a system. An    $n$   -dimensional augmented cube network (   $AQ_{n}$   ) is a variant of an    $n$   -dimensional hypercube network. In this paper, we first prove that an    $n$   -dimensional augmented cube network is    $(4n-8)/ (4n-8)$   -diagnosable, which implies that the    $t/t$   -diagnosability of    $AQ_{n}$    is approximately two times larger than its classical    $t$   -diagnosability. Some useful properties of    $AQ_{n}$    not reported by previous studies are proposed. By employing these new properties, we prove that    $AQ_{n}$    is    $t/k$   -diagnosable, which implies that the    $t/k$   -diagnosability is approximately    $(k+1)$    times larger than    $2n-1$   , i.e., the    $t$   -diagnosability of    $AQ_{n}$   , where    $t=2(k+1)n-(({3(k+1)(k+2)})/{2})+1$   ,    $kleqslant ({4n}/{9})-({13}/{9})$   , and    $nu003e 5$   .",

The general goal of this project is to encourage multidisciplinary interactive and cooperative research on modeling coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in geologic formations in support of the performance assessment for underground storage of radioactive waste. One of the research tasks, initiated in 2004 by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), addresses the long-term impact of geomechanical and geochemical processes on the flow conditions near waste emplacement tunnels. Within this task, four international research teams conduct predictive analysis of the coupled processes in two generic repositories, using multiple approaches and different computer codes. Below, we give an overview of the research task and report its current status.",

Using a general reliability model for grid computing to relax some impractical assumptions, a heuristic algorithm is presented to evaluate grid program/service reliability. The heuristic algorithm is based on two heuristic criteria that determine the significance of an entity and prune those insignificant ones. Through algorithm analysis, the heuristic algorithm is shown to have a linear complexity. This is much better than the previous algorithms, which are of exponential complexity. Another advantage of the heuristic algorithm is that the running time is controllable by adjusting the parameter of significant level (SL) and significant rate. A regression method is proposed to adjust the SL and predict the running time. Two examples are given",

Although the development tools and techniques for the grid have been extensively investigated, the availability of the grid resource management system (RMS) has not been comprehensively studied. In order to contribute to this lacking but important field, this paper first models the grid RMS availability by considering both the failures of resource management (RM) servers and the length limitation of request queues. A hierarchical Markov reward model is implemented to evaluate the grid RMS availability. Based on the availability model, an optimization problem for designing the grid RMS is studied in order to minimize the cost by determining the best number of RM servers. Then, the sensitivity analysis is conducted, and a dynamic switching scheduling method is further presented based on the sensitivity analysis.",

Machine learning (ML) methods, with several reported successful applications, have gained popularity for software cost estimation in recent years. Data preprocessing has been claimed by many researchers as a fundamental stage of ML methods; however, very few works have been focused on the effects of data preprocessing techniques. ObjectiveThis study aims for an empirical assessment of the effectiveness of data preprocessing techniques on ML methods in the context of software cost estimation. MethodIn this work, we first conduct a literature survey of the recent publications using data preprocessing techniques, followed by a systematic empirical study to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of individual data preprocessing techniques as well as their combinations. ResultsOur results indicate that data preprocessing techniques may significantly influence the final prediction. They sometimes might have negative impacts on prediction performance of ML methods. ConclusionIn order to reduce prediction errors and improve efficiency, a careful selection is necessary according to the characteristics of machine learning methods, as well as the datasets used for software cost estimation.",

The AUC 0-t were (116.26.6 \u00b1 19.99), (67.74 \u00b1 12.79), (25.01 \u00b12.62) \u03bcg \u00b7 h \u00b7 mL -1, and (45.03 \u00b15.84), (27.26 \u00b13.57), (10.59 \u00b1 1.86) \u03bcg \u00b7 h \u00b7 mL -1, respectively. The t max were both 2.5 h. CONCLUSION: Compared with normal group, the \u03c1 max and AUC 0-t of TGP in model group significantly increased, t max decreased, and t 1/2 prolonged; t max and t 1/2 had no difference among three dosages, and \u03c1 max. and AUC 0-t had correlation with dosage.

        "abstract": "Aim: To determine the plasma protein binding rates of Total Glucosides of Paeony(TGP)in liver injury rats induced by CCl4 and in normal rats,using paeoniflorin and albiflorin as the indicator composition.Methods: The equilibrium dialysis method and HPLC were employed to determine the plasma protein binding rates of paeoniflorin and albiflorin in TGP in liver injury rats induced by CCl4 and in rat plasma.The plasma protein binding rates of high,middle and low groups were calculated using standard curves.Results : At the concentration of 50,100,200 \u03bcg/ml of TGP,the plasma protein binding rates of Paeoniflorin with liver injury rat plasma were(15.5\u00b10.4)%,(16.5\u00b11.4)%,(27.9\u00b11.6)% and with normal rat plasma were(12.7\u00b11.6)%,(13.5\u00b10.8)%,(15.6\u00b10.6)%.the plasma protein binding rates of albiflorin with liver injury rat plasma were(12.4\u00b11.5)%,(13.2\u00b11.6)%,(20.2\u00b12.1)% and with normal rat plasma were(8.1\u00b10.9)%,(9.7\u00b12.3)%,(14.7\u00b11.4)%.Conclusions: Paeoniflorin and albiflorin in TGP had low protein binding capacities with the two kinds of rat plasma.Moreover,the binding rates are proportionally dependent on plasma concentration of TGP.The binding rates are increased dramatically in liver injury rats induced by CCl4 compared with the normal rats.",
