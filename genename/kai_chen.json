        "abstract": "Trichoderma viride LTR-2 is a plant disease suppressive fungus.The \u03b2-1,4-glucanase gene from Bacillus megaterium strain Ap25 was cloned to form the expression vector pSilent/glu14,and used to transform LTR-2 by restriction enzyme mediated integration(REMI).Chromosomal integration was confirmed by PCR and DNA hybridization.In comparison with wild type LTR-2,all glu14 recombinant strains expressed higher glucanse activity and in vitro growth inhibition of the plant pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis.The recombinant L-10 significantly showed the highest disease suppressive efficacy,and had increased disease suppression by 27.0% in vitro growth of R.cerealis and 26.7% in planta severity of wheat sheath blight disease(P<0.01).The results indicated that Trichoderma recombinant strains with enhanced bio-control efficiency could be effectively constructed by inserting \u03b2-1,4-glucanase gene into chromosome DNA with REMI method.",

The BLAST search result showed that the highest 16S rDNA gene sequence homology between stain A-29 and Streptomyces viridocyaneus YIM30997 (AF513223) was approximately 98.9%.Phenotypic characteristics between A-29 and S. viridocyaneus were identical except xylose utilization and indole reaction,so strain A-29 was identified as Streptomyces viridocyaneus. The sterile fermentation extraction of strain A-29 had antifungal activity against such 8 species plant pathogenic fungi on a PDA dish as Pyricularia grisea,Verticillium dahliae,Colletotrichum lagenarium,Macrophoma kawatsukai,Bipolaris sorokinana,Gaeumannomyces graminis,Alternaria brassica,Fusarium graminearum.

A 1.8 kb DNA fragment containing chitinase gene and SD sequence was amplified with the template pMSDChi113 and was inserted into shuttle vector pHY300PLK to construct a new plasmid, pHYChi113. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into B.megterium, resulting in a new strain named Ap25-chi113. Chitin plate culture and PCR amplification confirmed that Ap25-chi113 contained a functional chitinase gene. Comparing with the wild type Ap25 in dural culture experiment, Ap25-chi113 increased its effect against the pathogenic fungi. Especially, the inhibition percentage against Coniothyrium fuckellii increased about 13%.

After that we design the binarization technique combined the method which improved Niblack and the local thresholding using the small neighbourhood which influenced the mean value of the areas.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new geometric constraint method: Maximal Clique Matching (MCM). In MCM, the global geometric constraint problem can be expressed as the maximal clique problem in graph theory. MCM starts from building a geometric correspondence graph (GCG) based upon the pairwise geometric information in local features, and then an efficient heuristic approximation algorithm is developed to get the global geometric relationships by finding the maximal cliques in GCG. Given the characteristics of the global optimality of maximal cliques, MCM is robust to occlusion, clutter, deformations and repetitive patterns. We evaluated the method using two public datasets. Results show that our method outperforms other up-to-date techniques.",

Unfortunately, most existing decompilation tools suffer from the low accuracy in identifying variables, functions and composite structures, which results in poor readability. To address these limitations, we present a practical decompiler called C-Decompiler for Windows C programs that (1) uses a shadow stack to perform refined data flow analysis, and (2) adopts inter-basic-block register propagation to reduce redundant variables. Our experimental results illustrate that on average C-Decompiler has the highest total percentage reduction of 55.91%, lowest variable expansion rate of 55.79% in the three tools, and the same Cyclomatic Complexity as the original source code for each test application. Furthermore, in our experiment, C-Decompiler is able to recognize functions with lower false positive and false negative rate. In the studies, we show that C-Decompiler is a practical tool to produce highly readable C code.",

Most current localization schemes are not well suitable for deep underwater environment. We propose a hierarchical localization scheme to address the challenging problems. The new scheme mainly consists of four types of nodes, which are surface buoys, Detachable Elevator Transceivers (DETs), anchor nodes and ordinary nodes. Surface buoy is assumed to be equipped with GPS on the water surface. A DET is attached to a surface buoy and can rise and down to broadcast its position. The anchor nodes can compute their positions based on the position information from the DETs and the measurements of distance to the DETs. The hierarchical localization scheme is scalable, and can be used to make balances on the cost and localization accuracy. Initial simulation results show the advantages of our proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic Binary Translation(DBT) is widely used, but it suffers from substantial overhead. Several methods are taken to improve its performance, such as linking/chaining, building super block according to profiling and/or tracing. Reorganizing code layout of software cache can also improve performance on the ground that the execution stream will be more approximate to its control flow. Once the target code in software cache is reframed properly, hot code will be gathered together and well organized. Because of exact prediction and improved locality, the execution stream will concentrate on a small area with less control transfer. In this paper, we designed a new approach using dynamic-static combined framework to reorganize code layout of software cache. Then we compare it with another two conventional types of code layout in detail. Experimental result shows that our method can significantly cut down the overhead. The overall run time reduced by about 30% on average. Finally, we analyze the reason why reorganizing code layout can improve the performance of dynamic binary translator from several different perspectives.",

Low image quality, complex background and variations of text make these problems challenging. Our approach includes the following stages: (1) Template images are generated automatically; (2) SIFT features are extracted and matched to template images; (3) Multiple single-character-areas are located using segmentation algorithm based upon multiple-size sliding subwindows; (4) An voting and geometric verification algorithm is used to identify final results. This framework thus is essentially simple by skipping many steps, such as normalization, binarization and OCR, which are required in previous methods. Moreover, this framework is robust as only SIFT feature is used. We evaluated our method using 200,000+ images in 3 scripts (Chinese, Japanese and Korean). We obtained average single-character success rate of 77.3% (highest 94.1%), average multiplecharacter success rate of 63.9% (highest 89.6%).",

        "abstract": "Data-parallel computing frameworks (DCF) such as MapReduce, Spark, and Dryad etc. Have tremendous applications in big data and cloud computing, and throw tons of flows into data center networks. In this paper, we design and implement FLOW PROPHET, a general framework to predict traffic flows for DCFs. To this end, we analyze and summarize the common features of popular DCFs, and gain a key insight: since application logic in DCFs is naturally expressed by directed acyclic graphs (DAG), DAG contains necessary time and data dependencies for accurate flow prediction. Based on the insight, FLOW PROPHET extracts DAGs from user applications, and uses the time and data dependencies to calculate flow information 4-tuple, (source, destination, flow size, establish time), ahead-of-time for all flows. We also provide generic programming interface to FLOW PROPHET, so that current and future DCFs can deploy FLOW PROPHET readily. We implement FLOW PROPHET on both Spark and Hadoop, and perform extensive evaluations on a testbed with 37 physical servers. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that, with time in advance and minimal cost, FLOW PROPHET can achieve almost 100% accuracy in source, destination, and flow size predictions. With accurate prediction from FLOW PROPHET, the job completion time of a Hadoop TeraSort benchmark is reduced by 12.52% on our cluster with a simple network scheduler.",

        "abstract": "In Recent years embedded world has been undergoing a shift from traditional single-core processors to processors with multiple cores. However, this shift poses a challenge of adapting legacy uniprocessor-oriented real-time operating system (RTOS) to exploit the capability of multi-core processor. In addition, some embedded systems are inevitably going towards the direction of integrating real-time with off-the-shelf time-sharing system, as the combination of the two has the potential to provide not only timely and deterministic response but also a large application base. Virtualization technology, which ensures strong isolation between virtual machines, is therefore a promising solution to above mentioned issues. However, there remains a concern regarding the responsiveness of the RTOS running on top of a virtual machine. In this paper we propose an embedded real-time virtualization architecture based on Kernel-Based Virtual Machine (KVM), in which VxWorks and Linux are combined together. We then analyze and evaluate how KVM influences the interrupt-response times of VxWorks as a guest operating system. By applying several real-time performance tuning methods on the host Linux, we will show that sub-millisecond interrupt response latency can be achieved on the guest VxWorks.",

        "abstract": "Hot trace building plays an important role in enhancing the performance of dynamic binary translators, since in most cases 10% of code takes 90% of execution time of the whole program. Hot traces can promote the code position to make better the locality of the code, therefore programs can achieve a better performance. Thus how to build qualified and long hot traces is the key point. Considering the situation when one single basic block is needed by more than two hot traces, code replication can help build hot traces with cost of expansion of code size. In this paper, a code replication method to help with building hot traces as well as code positioning is presented, and experiments have been done to evaluate the details of changes that code replication brings to the system, like trace fragment length, memory size expansion, etc. With this method, a performance promotion by 0.5%-3.5% against the original trace building method has been achieved.",

        "abstract": "As the popularity of social networking sites increase, so does their attractiveness for criminals. In this work, we show how an adversary can build artificial identities using semantic information in social network. Our method make the identities look more like real people, therefore can be used to support many kinds of attacks, such as ASE, profile cloning. A prototype of this method is implemented, includes following stages: Firstly, categories of virtual identity are predefined, and each category has multiple properties, such as geographical region, hobby, education, age, interested topic/keywords, etc. Secondly, based on category information, each identity will foster its own \"life\" semantically, such as edit profile and update status, find hot related news/topic from Google then post to wall, find related groups/networks then request to add in, and find/like/create/comment pages/posts, etc. Thirdly, artificial identity will evolve to multiple stages according to its status (for example, number of friends of real people), single identity with different evolutionary stages is linked together to a group that will help to ensure the number of attack edges.",

First, we find 280 pictures of book covers, CD covers and movie posters shot with cameras on Internet. We manually label and extract text regions in them. Second, based on statistical analysis of the difference between text and non-text samples, we get three sets of features which are used to produce weak classifiers. Third, Ada-boost is utilized to select and combine these weak classifiers into two-stage attentional cascade. At last, this two-stage cascade can detect text area in images by classifying sub-regions of images as text and non-text. Compared with previous works, this method is robust in detecting single characters, skewed and even vertical lines.",

Unlike in the terrestrial positioning, the global positioning system (GPS) can not work efficiently underwater. The limited bandwidth, the severely impaired channel and the cost of underwater equipment all makes the localization problem very challenging. Most current localization schemes are not well suitable for deep underwater environment. We propose a hierarchical localization scheme to address the challenging problems. The new scheme mainly consists of four types of nodes, which are surface buoys, Detachable Elevator Transceivers (DETs), anchor nodes and ordinary nodes. Surface buoy is assumed to be equipped with GPS on the water surface. A DET is attached to a surface buoy and can rise and down to broadcast its position. The anchor nodes can compute their positions based on the position information from the DETs and the measurements of distance to the DETs. The hierarchical localization scheme is scalable, and can be used to make balances on the cost and localization accuracy. Initial simulation results show the advantages of our proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "The reference [1] presents a novel approach for Chinese character recognition. Based on it, we know that we can treat character recognition as an image matching problem. Compared with traditional OCR, the new approach for character recognition uniquely uses local invariant descriptors as a new feature extraction method. In this paper, we present a new local descriptor which combines the scale-invariant feature descriptor with contrast distributions of a local region to produce highly efficient feature representation. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of the new approach with various datasets acquired under varying circumstances. Our experiments demonstrate that our two-component descriptor can represent local region with more information and perform better than SIFT.",

        "abstract": "Analysis of Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data is a key for achieving city smartness. In this paper a multitier fog computing model with large-scale data analytics service is proposed for smart cities applications. The multitier fog is consisted of ad-hoc fogs and dedicated fogs with opportunistic and dedicated computing resources, respectively. The proposed new fog computing model with clear functional modules is able to mitigate the potential problems of dedicated computing infrastructure and slow response in cloud computing. We run analytics benchmark experiments over fogs formed by Rapsberry Pi computers with a distributed computing engine to measure computing performance of various analytics tasks, and create easy-to-use workload models. Quality of services (QoS) aware admission control, offloading, and resource allocation schemes are designed to support data analytics services, and maximize analytics service utilities. Availability and cost models of networking and computing resources are taken into account in QoS scheme design. A scalable system level simulator is developed to evaluate the fog-based analytics service and the QoS management schemes. Experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of analytics services over multitier fogs and the effectiveness of the proposed QoS schemes. Fogs can largely improve the performance of smart city analytics services than cloud only model in terms of job blocking probability and service utility.",

In this paper we propose an adaptive data transmission scheme which is based on CSMA/CA access control scheme, for applications which may have heavy traffic loads such as smart grids. In the proposed scheme, the personal area network (PAN) coordinator will adaptively broadcast a frame length threshold, which is used by the sensors to make decision whether a data frame should be transmitted directly to the target destinations, or follow a short data request frame. If the data frame is long and prone to collision, use of a short data request frame can efficiently reduce the costs of the potential collision on the energy and bandwidth. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with largely improve bandwidth and power efficiency. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

        "abstract": "IEEE 802.16 standards have been developed as one of the technical solutions for broadband wireless access systems. It has high data rate, large network coverage, flexible QoS schemes and cheap network deployment. Various flexible mechanisms related to QoS provisioning have been specified for uplink traffic at the medium access control (MAC) layer in the standards. Among the mechanisms, contention based bandwidth request scheme can be used to indicate bandwidth demands to the base station for the non-real-time polling and best- effort services. These two services are used for most application with unknown traffic characteristics. Due to the diverse QoS requirements of those applications, service differentiation (SD) is anticipated over the contention based bandwidth request scheme. In this paper we investigate the SD with the bandwidth request scheme by means of assigning different channel access parameters and bandwidth allocation priorities. The effectiveness of the differentiation schemes are evaluated by simulations. It is observed that the initial backoff window can be efficient in SD, and if combined with the bandwidth allocation priority, the SD performances will be better.",

        "abstract": "GPUs are many-core processors with tremendous computational power. However, as automatic parallelization has not been realized yet, developing high-performance parallel code for GPUs is still very challenging. The paper presents a novel translation framework designed for virtual execution environment based on CPU/GPU architecture. It addresses two major challenges of taking advantage of general purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU) to improve performance: no rewriting the existing source code and resolving binary compatibility issues between different GPUs. The translation framework uses semi-automatic parallelization technology to port existing code to explicitly parallel programming models. It not only offers a mapping strategy from X86 platform to CUDA programming model, but also synchronizes the execution between the CPU and the GPUs. The input to our translation framework is parallelizable part of the program within binary code. With an additional information related to the parallelizable part, the translation framework transforms the sequential code into PTX code and execute it on GPUs. Experimental results on several programs from CUDA SDK Code Samples and Parboil Benchmark Suite show that our translation framework could achieve very high performance, even up to several tens of times speedup over the X86 native version.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic binary translation (DBT) has attracted much attention as a powerful technique for the runtime adaptation of software among different ISAs. It offers unprecedented flexibility in the control and modification of a program during the runtime. However, its inherent high overhead has perplexed researchers for many years. In order to reduce the overhead of DBT, this paper presents a dynamic-static combined approach to reorganize the layout of software cache. Under this approach, we first employ an emulating execution to collect the profile information and the translated target code. Especially, the path of execution flow will be tracked. In the static phase, based on the profile information collected in the previous stage, we first use the method of code replicating to build the traces, and then reorganize the layout of the target code by putting the hottest traces at the top of the software cache. Because of exact prediction and improved locality, the execution stream will concentrate on a small area with less control transfer. This approach can greatly reduce the overhead of DBT on the condition that the program runs repeatedly. Experimental results on executing the SPEC 2000 benchmarks show that our approach can reduce more than 30% run time on average. \u00a9 2011 Academy Publisher.",

        "abstract": "IEEE 802.16 network is widely viewed as a strong candidate solution for broadband wireless access systems. Various flexible mechanisms related to QoS provisioning have been specified for uplink traffic at the medium access control (MAC) layer in the standards. Among the mechanisms, bandwidth request scheme can be used to indicate and request bandwidth demands to the base station for different services. Due to the diverse QoS requirements of the applications, service differentiation (SD) is desirable for the bandwidth request scheme. In this paper, we propose several SD approaches. The approaches are based on the contention-based bandwidth request scheme and achieved by the means of assigning different channel access parameters and/or bandwidth allocation priorities to different services. Additionally, we propose effective analytical model to study the impacts of the SD approaches, which can be used for the configuration and optimization of the SD services. It is observed from simulations that the analytical model has high accuracy. Service can be efficiently differentiated with initial backoff window in terms of throughput and channel access delay. Moreover, the service differentiation can be improved if combined with the bandwidth allocation priority approach without adverse impacts on the overall system throughput.",

        "abstract": "Mobile visual search business has been prospering since research break-through on content based image retrieval (CBIR) and continuous improving mobile technology. In such search application, user takes photo and uploads photo to server. Retrieval is done at the server side and user gets result from the server. Currently search applications have difficulties. 1) Mobile photos have relatively low qualities, and photos contain various affine transforms. The two drawbacks will influence the retrieval accuracy. 2) Retrieval speed and accuracy could not meet a balance for large scale database. Current index mechanism for high dimensional local feature such as SIFT is not fast enough while lots of low dimensional feature cannot ensure high accuracy. This paper proposes a fully-automated offline stable point filtering method for mobile visual search application. We use various transforms to simulate effects caused by mobile photo images. They are processed in our offline method to reduce the index size of the retrieval application. Experiments show that with proper offline processing, 13.83% memory or disk space could be saved when retrieval application loads SIFT features into memory for LSH at the online stage while application still maintains a high query accuracy.",

Combining dynamic binary translation with static analysis brings an opportunity to improve the runtime performance. Once the source image has been executed, the profile information and target code will be saved, which are available at next runs. Moreover, optimizations will be implemented during static analysis phase. This approach reduces the overhead of optimizing, profiling and translating on condition that the program runs repeatedly.

Meanwhile, one of the hot topics in this field is to extend virtualization for embedded systems.

The goal of this paper is to optimize the Xen virtualization platform to be real-time operating system friendly. We improve two aspects of the Xen virtualization platform. First, we improve the xen scheduler to manage the scheduling latency and response time of the real-time operating system. Second, we import multiple real-time operating systems balancing method. Our experiment demonstrates that our enhancement to the Xen virtualization platform support real-time operating system well and the improvement to the real-time performance is about 20%.",

Our work consists of two main parts, learning-based text location and adaptive binarization guided recognition. First we extract three types of robust features from the training data provided on ICDAR2005 and utilize Ada-boost to combine these features into a powerful classifier for text regions detection and location. Second we apply the proposed adaptive binarization to process the located regions for recognition. Compared with previous works, our algorithm is robust in size, font and color of text, and insensitive for languages. In experiments, our system proved to have attractive performance.",

        "abstract": "IEEE 802.16 network is widely viewed as a strong candidate solution for broadband wireless access systems. Various flexible mechanisms related to QoS provisioning have been specified for uplink traffic at the medium access control (MAC) layer in the standards. Among the mechanisms, bandwidth request scheme can be used to indicate and request bandwidth demands to the base station for different services. Due to the diverse QoS requirements of the applications, service differentiation (SD) is desirable for the bandwidth request scheme. In this paper, we propose several SD approaches. The approaches are based on the contention-based bandwidth request scheme and achieved by the means of assigning different channel access parameters and/or bandwidth allocation priorities to different services. Additionally, we propose effective analytical model to study the impacts of the SD approaches, which can be used for the configuration and optimization of the SD services. It is observed from simulations that the analytical model has high accuracy. Service can be efficiently differentiated with initial backoff window in terms of throughput and channel access delay. Moreover, the service differentiation can be improved if combined with the bandwidth allocation priority approach without adverse impacts on the overall system throughput.",

        "abstract": "Recently underwater sensor networks (UWSN) attracted large research interests. Medium access control (MAC) is one of the major challenges faced by UWSN due to the large propagation delay and narrow channel bandwidth of acoustic communications used for UWSN. Widely used slotted aloha (S-Aloha) protocol suffers large performance loss in UWSNs, which can only achieve performance close to pure aloha (PAloha). In this paper we theoretically model the performances of S-Aloha and P-Aloha protocols and analyze the adverse impact of propagation delay. According to the observation on the performances of S-Aloha protocol we propose two enhanced S-Aloha protocols in order to minimize the adverse impact of propagation delay on S-Aloha protocol. The first enhancement is a synchronized arrival S-Aloha (SA-Aloha) protocol, in which frames are transmitted at carefully calculated time to align the frame arrival time with the start of time slots. Propagation delay is taken into consideration in the calculation of transmit time. As estimation error on propagation delay may exist and can affect network performance, an improved SA-Aloha (denoted by ISAAloha) is proposed, which adjusts the slot size according to the range of delay estimation errors. Simulation results show that both SA-Aloha and ISA-Aloha perform remarkably better than S-Aloha and P-Aloha for UWSN, and ISA-Aloha is more robust even when the propagation delay estimation error is large.",

        "abstract": "Interest in traffic classification has dramatically grown in the past few years in both industry and academia. As more and more applications are encrypting the payloads and not to use well-known ports, traditional traffic classification methods such as transport-layer protocol ports based ones can not accurately and efficiently deal with these applications. In this paper we investigate the problem of classifing traffic flows into different application categories. And a new bag-of-words (BoW) model based traffic classification method is proposed, which has been widely used in document classification and computer vision. In the new traffic classification method the application categories of interests represents the bags, centroids represent the words of the BoW model, respectively. By constructing representation vectors for the application categories and calculating the cosine similarity between each category representation vector and newly built-up vector converted from flows to be tested, we can find the application category that a tested flow belongs to. Using real traffic traces we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve 93% overall accuracy and the classification is not affected by the packet arrival sequences (e.g. out of order arrivals). The overall accuracy of the proposed approach is observed to be higher than the widely used C4.5 algorithm by 10% in our experiment when the out of order arrival happens.",

        "abstract": "Inter-datacenter wide area networks (inter-DC WAN) carry a significant amount of data transfers that require to be completed within certain time periods, or deadlines. However, very little work has been done to guarantee such deadlines. The crux is that the current inter-DC WAN lacks an interface for users to specify their transfer deadlines and a mechanism for provider to ensure the completion while maintaining high WAN utilization. This paper addresses the problem by introducing a Deadline-based Network Abstraction (DNA) for inter-DC WANs. DNA allows users to explicitly specify the amount of data to be delivered and the deadline by which it has to be completed. The malleability of DNA provides flexibility in resource allocation. Based on this, we develop a system called Amoeba that implements DNA. Our simulations and testbed experiments show that Amoeba, by harnessing DNA's malleability, accommodates 15% more user requests with deadlines, while achieving 60% higher WAN utilization than prior solutions.",

        "abstract": "Traffic optimizations (TO, e.g. flow scheduling, load balancing) in datacenters are difficult online decision-making problems. Previously, they are done with heuristics relying on operators' understanding of the workload and environment. Designing and implementing proper TO algorithms thus take at least weeks. Encouraged by recent successes in applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to solve complex online control problems, we study if DRL can be used for automatic TO without human-intervention. However, our experiments show that the latency of current DRL systems cannot handle flow-level TO at the scale of current datacenters, because short flows (which constitute the majority of traffic) are usually gone before decisions can be made.\n\nLeveraging the long-tail distribution of datacenter traffic, we develop a two-level DRL system, AuTO, mimicking the Peripheral & Central Nervous Systems in animals, to solve the scalability problem. Peripheral Systems (PS) reside on end-hosts, collect flow information, and make TO decisions locally with minimal delay for short flows. PS's decisions are informed by a Central System (CS), where global traffic information is aggregated and processed. CS further makes individual TO decisions for long flows. With CS&PS, AuTO is an end-to-end automatic TO system that can collect network information, learn from past decisions, and perform actions to achieve operator-defined goals. We implement AuTO with popular machine learning frameworks and commodity servers, and deploy it on a 32-server testbed. Compared to existing approaches, AuTO reduces the TO turn-around time from weeks to ~100 milliseconds while achieving superior performance. For example, it demonstrates up to 48.14% reduction in average flow completion time (FCT) over existing solutions.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Cloud applications generate a mix of flows with and without deadlines. Scheduling such mix-flows is a key challenge; our experiments show that trivially combining existing schemes for deadline/non-deadline flows is problematic. For example, prioritizing deadline flows hurts flow completion time (FCT) for non-deadline flows, with minor improvement for deadline miss rate. We present Karuna, a first systematic solution for scheduling mix-flows. Our key insight is that deadline flows should meet their deadlines while minimally impacting the FCT of non-deadline flows. To achieve this goal, we design a novel Minimal-impact Congestion control Protocol (MCP) that handles deadline flows with as little bandwidth as possible. For non-deadline flows, we extend an existing FCT minimization scheme to schedule flows with known and unknown sizes. Karuna requires no switch modifications and is back- ward compatible with legacy TCP/IP stacks. Our testbed experiments and simulations show that Karuna effectively schedules mix-flows, for example, reducing the 95th percentile FCT of non-deadline flows by up to 47.78% at high load compared to pFabric, while maintaining low (<5.8%) deadline miss rate.",

        "abstract": "Despite continued efforts toward building high bandwidth, low cost datacenter networks with reconfigurable optical fabrics, the impact of optical networks on datacenter applications has received little attention. Given the constraints of optical networks and the semantics of datacenter applications, we believe the network-application intersection to be the next innovation hotspot. In this paper, we specifically focus on data-parallel applications for two primary reasons: they are a natural fit to exploit high bandwidth optical fabrics, and they often form structured communication patterns or coflows.\n\nWe show that configuring circuits in reaction to changing traffic patterns is not enough. Efficient scheduling of even a single coflow in optical networks should be a \"Pas de deux\"1 -- a joint shaping of not only the underlying circuit, but also the application's traffic demand. Our preliminary evaluation with a production trace shows that joint shaping is on average within 1.18x of the optimal and performs 30% better than solutions that configure circuits in application-agnostic fashions. We further extend our analysis to inter-coflow scheduling and propose a layered solution that jointly considers circuit reconfiguration, coflow prioritization, as well as flow rate and route assignments.\n\n",

In this paper, we categorize the trust models of current industrial and academic cloud billing solutions, and discuss the problems with these models in terms of degree of trust, scalability and robustness. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel public trust model to ensure natural and intuitive verification of billable events in the cloud. Leveraging a Bitcoin-like mechanism, we design BitBill, a scalable, robust and mutually verifiable billing system for cloud computing. Our initial results show that BitBill has significantly better scalability (supporting 10x concurrent tenants using the billing service) than the state-of-the-art third-party centralized billing system.",

        "abstract": "Todayu0027s cloud networks are shared among many tenants. Bandwidth guarantees and work conservation are two key properties to ensure predictable performance for tenant applications and high network utilization for providers. Despite significant efforts, very little prior work can really achieve both properties simultaneously even some of them claimed so. In this paper, we present QShare, a comprehensive in-network solution to achieve bandwidth guarantees and work conservation simultaneously. QShare leverages weighted fair queuing on commodity switches to slice network bandwidth for tenants, and solves the challenge of queue scarcity through balanced tenant placement and dynamic tenant-queue binding. We have implemented a QShare prototype and evaluated it extensively via both testbed experiments and simulations. Our results show that QShare ensures bandwidth guarantees while driving network utilization to over 91% even under unpredictable traffic demands.",

        "abstract": "Many existing data center network (DCN) flow scheduling schemes minimize flow completion times (FCT) based on prior knowledge of flows and custom switch functions, making them superior in performance but hard to use in practice. By contrast, we seek to minimize FCT with no prior knowledge and existing commodity switch hardware.To this end, we present PIAS, a DCN flow scheduling mechanism that aims to minimize FCT by mimicking Shortest Job First (SJF) on the premise that flow size is not known a priori. At its heart, PIAS leverages multiple priority queues available in existing commodity switches to implement a Multiple Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ), in which a PIAS flow is gradually demoted from higher-priority queues to lower-priority queues based on the number of bytes it has sent. As a result, short flows are likely to be finished in the first few high-priority queues and thus be prioritized over long flows in general, which enables PIAS to emulate SJF without knowing flow sizes beforehand.We have implemented a PIAS prototype and evaluated PIAS through both testbed experiments and ns- 2 simulations. We show that PIAS is readily deployable with commodity switches and backward compatible with legacy TCP/IP stacks. Our evaluation results show that PIAS significantly outperforms existing information-agnostic schemes. For example, it reduces FCT by up to 50% and 40% over DCTCP [11] and L2DCT [27] respectively; and it only has a 4.9% performance gap to an ideal information-aware scheme, pFabric [13], for short flows under a production DCN workload.",

        "abstract": "Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is crucial for production datacenters, but current queue-length based ECN/RED implementation does not work with generic packet schedulers, leading to either degraded network performance or violated scheduling policies. In this paper, we first dive into this issue and reveal that the invalidity of ECN/RED lies in the difficulty of measuring changing queue capacities under various schedulers and traffic dynamics. Then we present Time-based Congestion Notification (TCN), a simple yet effective ECN solution, by combining two successful ideas: the sojourn time from CoDel and the instantaneous marking from DCTCP. Using packet sojourn-time, as opposed to queue-length, as the congestion signal, TCN eliminates the need of measuring dynamic queue capacities, making it suitable for arbitrary schedulers with traffic dynamics. By performing stateless instantaneous ECN marking rather than complex stateful dropping, TCN is designed to be inexpensive to implement on commodity switching chips. Through extensive testbed experiments and large-scale simulations, we show TCN can strictly preserve scheduling policies while providing desirable network performance. For example, TCN significantly reduces the average and 99th percentile completion times for small flows by up to 82.8% and 95.3% compared to current practice in a testbed experiment with production workload.",

        "abstract": "Recently, proactive congestion control solutions have drawn great attention in the community. By explicitly scheduling data transmissions based on the availability of network bandwidth, proactive solutions offer a lossless, near-zero queueing network for serving network transfers. Despite the advantages, proactive solutions require an extra RTT to allocate the ideal sending rate for new arrival flows. To resolve this, current solutions let new flows blindly transmit unscheduled packets in the first RTT, and assign these packets with high priority in the network. The unscheduled packets, however, can cause serious network congestion, resulting in large queue buildups and excessive packet losses.\n\nThis paper describes Aeolus, a solution aimed at achieving both: eliminating the one RTT additional delay and preserving all the good properties of proactive solutions. Similar to current solutions, Aeolus lets new flows start at the line rate on their arrivals. However, Aeolus introduces a new switch mechanism which allows the switch to selectively drop excessive unscheduled packets once congestion occurs, thus protecting the scheduled packets from the potential queueing delay and packet loss caused by the unscheduled packets. Our simulations with realistic workloads show that Aeolus can significantly speed up small flows, e.g., deliver 55.9% lower 99th percentile completion time, while preserving all the good properties of proactive solutions.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the increasing scale of data, we see a growing need of high performance distributed machine learning systems. Many research works are being proposed to improve distributed machine learning performance.\n\nIn this paper, we call upon this community to rethink transport layer solutions for distributed machine learning due to their stringent network requirements and special algorithmic properties. Distributed machine learning jobs generate bursty traffic when synchronizing parameters and a long tail flow can significantly slow down the complete training process. Meanwhile, in contrast to other distributed system applications, we find that machine learning algorithms are bounded-loss tolerant: randomized network data losses below a certain fraction (typically 10%--35%) will do little harm to the end to end job performance. Motivated by this observation, we highlight new opportunities to design bounded-loss tolerant transport to optimize the performance of distributed machine learning. By intentionally ignoring some packet losses, we can avoid unnecessary loss retransmissions, thus reducing the tail flow completion time. Following this principle, our preliminary results show that a simplified protocol can give 1.1-2.2x speedup on different distributed machine learning tasks.\n\n",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present our effort towards comprehensive traffic forecasting for big data applications using external, light-weighted file system monitoring. Our idea is motivated by the key observations that rich traffic demand information already exists in the log and meta-data files of many big data applications, and that such information can be readily extracted through run-time file system monitoring. As the first step, we use Hadoop as a concrete example to explore our methodology and develop a system called HadoopWatch to predict traffic demands of Hadoop applications. We further implement HadoopWatch in a small-scale testbed with 10 physical servers and 30 virtual machines. Our experiments over a series of MapReduce applications demonstrate that HadoopWatch can forecast the traffic demand with almost 100% accuracy and time advance. Furthermore, it makes no modification on the Hadoop framework, and introduces little overhead to the application performance. Finally, to showcase the utility of accurate traffic prediction made by HadoopWatch, we design and implement a simple HadoopWatch-enabled network optimization module into the HadoopWatch controller, and with realistic Hadoop job benchmarks we find that even a simple algorithm can leverage the forecasting results provided by HadoopWatch to significantly improve the Hadoop job completion time by up to 14.72%.",

        "abstract": "Inter-data center wide area networks inter-DC WANs carry a significant amount of data transfers that require to be completed within certain time periods, or deadlines. However, very little work has been done to guarantee such deadlines. The crux is that the current inter-DC WAN lacks an interface for users to specify their transfer deadlines and a mechanism for provider to ensure the completion while maintaining high WAN utilization. In this paper, we address the problem by introducing a deadline-based network abstraction DNA for inter-DC WANs. DNA allows users to explicitly specify the amount of data to be delivered and the deadline by which it has to be completed. The malleability of DNA provides flexibility in resource allocation. Based on this, we develop a system called Amoeba that implements DNA. Our simulations and test bed experiments show that Amoeba, by harnessing DNA\u2019s malleability, accommodates 15% more user requests with deadlines, while achieving 60% higher WAN utilization than prior solutions.",

        "abstract": "Datacenter transports should provide low average and tail flow completion times (FCT) to achieve desired application performance. While most prior datacenter transports take either ECN or RTT as congestion signal, this paper makes a case that both signals are indispensable: ECN, as a per-hop signal, is more effective to prevent packet loss; while RTT, as an end-to-end signal, controls end-to-end queueing delay better. As persistent low flow completion times imply low queueing delay and near zero packet loss, we introduce EAR, a new datacenter transport that hears and reacts to both ECN and RTT. Our preliminary results show that: 1) compared to delay-based DCTCP, EAR achieves up to 91% lower packet losses and 93% fewer timeouts; 2) compared to ECN-based DCTCP, EAR reduces RTT by up to 32% for cross-rack traffic in a 4-level fattree. As a result, EAR delivers persistent low average and tail completion times under various scenarios in large scale simulations.",

However, the buffer size of commodity switches increases slowly, thus significantly outpaced by the link speed. In such extremely shallow-buffered datacenter networks, prior TCP/ECN solutions suffer from either excessive packet losses or significant throughput degradation. Motivated by this, we introduce BCC, a simple yet effective solution with only one more configuration (shared buffer ECN/RED) at commodity switches. BCC operates based on real-time shared buffer utilization. When the buffer is abundant, BCC delivers both high throughput and low packet loss rate. When it becomes scarce, BCC triggers shared buffer ECN/RED to prevent packet losses at the cost of sacrificing a small amount of throughput. Our preliminary results show that BCC maintains low packet loss rate persistently while only slightly degrading throughput when the buffer becomes insufficient. Compared to current practice, BCC achieves up to 94.4% lower 99th percentile completion time for small flows while only degrading large flows by up to 2.8%.",

        "abstract": "Recent proposals have leveraged Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to achieve high throughput low latency data center network (DCN) transport. However, most of them implicitly assume each switch port has one queue, making the ECN schemes they designed inapplicable to production DCNs where multiple service queues per port are employed to isolate different traffic classes through weighted fair sharing.In this paper, we reveal this problem by leveraging extensive testbed experiments to explore the intrinsic tradeoffs between throughput, latency, and weighted fair sharing in multi-queue scenarios. Using the guideline learned from the exploration, we design MQ-ECN, a simple yet effective solution to enable ECN for multi-service multiqueue production DCNs.

        "abstract": "Production datacenters operate under various uncertainties such as traffic dynamics, topology asymmetry, and failures. Therefore, datacenter load balancing schemes must be resilient to these uncertainties; i.e., they should accurately sense path conditions and timely react to mitigate the fallouts. Despite significant efforts, prior solutions have important drawbacks. On the one hand, solutions such as Presto and DRB are oblivious to path conditions and blindly reroute at fixed granularity. On the other hand, solutions such as CONGA and CLOVE can sense congestion, but they can only reroute when flowlets emerge; thus, they cannot always react timely to uncertainties. To make things worse, these solutions fail to detect/handle failures such as blackholes and random packet drops, which greatly degrades their performance. In this paper, we introduce Hermes, a datacenter load balancer that is resilient to the aforementioned uncertainties. At its heart, Hermes leverages comprehensive sensing to detect path conditions including failures unattended before, and it reacts using timely yet cautious rerouting. Hermes is a practical edge-based solution with no switch modification. We have implemented Hermes with commodity switches and evaluated it through both testbed experiments and large-scale simulations. Our results show that Hermes achieves comparable performance to CONGA and Presto in normal cases, and well handles uncertainties: under asymmetries, Hermes achieves up to 10% and 20% better flow completion time (FCT) than CONGA and CLOVE; under switch failures, it outperforms all other schemes by over 32%.",

        "abstract": "Many existing data center network (DCN) flow scheduling schemes, that minimize flow completion times (FCT) assume prior knowledge of flows and custom switch functions, making them superior in performance but hard to implement in practice. By contrast, we seek to minimize FCT with no prior knowledge and existing commodity switch hardware. To this end, we present PIAS, a DCN flow scheduling mechanism that aims to minimize FCT by mimicking shortest job first (SJF) on the premise that flow size is not known a priori. At its heart, PIAS leverages multiple priority queues available in existing commodity switches to implement a multiple level feedback queue, in which a PIAS flow is gradually demoted from higher-priority queues to lower-priority queues based on the number of bytes it has sent. As a result, short flows are likely to be finished in the first few high-priority queues and thus be prioritized over long flows in general, which enables PIAS to emulate SJF without knowing flow sizes beforehand. We have implemented a PIAS prototype and evaluated PIAS through both testbed experiments and ns-2 simulations. We show that PIAS is readily deployable with commodity switches and backward compatible with legacy TCP/IP stacks. Our evaluation results show that PIAS significantly outperforms existing information-agnostic schemes, for example, it reduces FCT by up to 50% compared to DCTCP and L2DCT; and it only has a 1.1% performance gap to an ideal information-aware scheme, pFabric, for short flows under a production DCN workload.",

        "abstract": "Flow completion times (FCTs) are critical for many cloud applications. To minimize the average FCT, recent transport designs, such as pFabric, PASE, and PIAS, approximate the Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) scheduling. A common, implicit assumption of these solutions is that the remaining time is only determined by the remaining flow size. However, this assumption does not hold in many real-world scenarios where applications generate data at diverse rates that are smaller than the network capacity. In this paper, we look into this issue from system perspective and find that the operating system (OS) kernel can be exploited to better estimate the remaining time of a flow. In particular, we use the rate of copying data from user space to kernel space to measure the data generation rate. We design RAX, a rate aware flow scheduling method, that calculates the remaining time of a flow more accurately, based on not only the flow size but also the data generation rate. We have implemented a RAX prototype in Linux kernel and evaluated it through testbed experiments and ns-2 simulations. Our testbed results show that RAX reduces FCT by up to 14.9%/41.8% and 7.8%/22.9% over DCTCP and PIAS for all/medium flows respectively.",

        "abstract": "Inter-data center wide area networks inter-DC WANs carry a significant amount of data transfers that require to be completed within certain time periods, or deadlines. However, very little work has been done to guarantee such deadlines. The crux is that the current inter-DC WAN lacks an interface for users to specify their transfer deadlines and a mechanism for provider to ensure the completion while maintaining high WAN utilization. In this paper, we address the problem by introducing a deadline-based network abstraction DNA for inter-DC WANs. DNA allows users to explicitly specify the amount of data to be delivered and the deadline by which it has to be completed. The malleability of DNA provides flexibility in resource allocation. Based on this, we develop a system called Amoeba that implements DNA. Our simulations and test bed experiments show that Amoeba, by harnessing DNA\u2019s malleability, accommodates 15% more user requests with deadlines, while achieving 60% higher WAN utilization than prior solutions.",

        "abstract": "Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is crucial for production datacenters, but current queue-length based ECN/RED implementation does not work with generic packet schedulers, leading to either degraded network performance or violated scheduling policies. In this paper, we first dive into this issue and reveal that the invalidity of ECN/RED lies in the difficulty of measuring changing queue capacities under various schedulers and traffic dynamics. Then we present Time-based Congestion Notification (TCN), a simple yet effective ECN solution, by combining two successful ideas: the sojourn time from CoDel and the instantaneous marking from DCTCP. Using packet sojourn-time, as opposed to queue-length, as the congestion signal, TCN eliminates the need of measuring dynamic queue capacities, making it suitable for arbitrary schedulers with traffic dynamics. By performing stateless instantaneous ECN marking rather than complex stateful dropping, TCN is designed to be inexpensive to implement on commodity switching chips. Through extensive testbed experiments and large-scale simulations, we show TCN can strictly preserve scheduling policies while providing desirable network performance. For example, TCN significantly reduces the average and 99th percentile completion times for small flows by up to 82.8% and 95.3% compared to current practice in a testbed experiment with production workload.",

For any third party, however, capturing and processing such huge volumes of real-time data in microblogs are almost infeasible tasks, as there always exist API (Application Program Interface) request limits, monitoring and computing budgets, as well as timeliness requirements. To deal with these challenges, we propose a cost-effective system framework with algorithms that can automatically select a subset of representative users in microblogging networks in offline, under given cost constraints. Then the proposed system can online monitor and utilize only these selected users\u2019 real-time microposts to detect the overall trending topics and predict their future popularity among the whole microblogging network. Therefore, our proposed system framework is practical for real-time usage as it avoids the high cost in capturing and processing full real-time data, while not compromising detection and prediction performance under given cost constraints. Experiments with real microblogs dataset show that by tracking only 500 users out of 0.6 million users and processing no more than 30,000 microposts daily, about 92% trending topics could be detected and predicted by the proposed system and, on average, more than 10 hours earlier than they appear in official trends lists.",

        "abstract": "Text detection in a natural environment plays an important role in many computer vision applications. While existing text detection methods are focused on English characters, there are strong application demands on text detection in other languages, such as Chinese. In this paper, we present a novel text detection algorithm for Chinese characters based on a specific designed convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN contains a text structure component detector layer, a spatial pyramid layer, and a multi-input-layer deep belief network (DBN). The CNN is pre-trained via a convolutional sparse auto-encoder, specifically designed for extracting complex features from Chinese characters. In particular, the text structure component detectors enhance the accuracy and uniqueness of feature descriptors by extracting multiple text structure components in various ways. The spatial pyramid layer enhances the scale invariability of the CNN for detecting texts in multiple scales. Finally, the multi-input-layer DBN replaces the fully connected layers in the CNN to ensure features from multiple scales are comparable. A multilingual text detection dataset, in which texts in Chinese, English, and digits are labeled separately, is set up to evaluate the proposed text detection algorithm. The proposed algorithm shows a significant performance improvement over the baseline CNN algorithms. In addition the proposed algorithm is evaluated over a public multilingual benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art result under multiple languages. Furthermore, a simplified version of the proposed algorithm with only general components is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 and 2013 datasets, showing comparable detection performance to the existing general text detection algorithms.",

Most features in existing text extraction algorithms are only applicable to one text extraction stage (text detection or recognition), which significantly weakens the consistency in an end-to-end system, especially for the complex Chinese texts. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a novel text structure feature extractor based on a text structure component detector (TSCD) layer and residual network for Chinese texts. Inspired by the three-layer Chinese text cognition model of a human, we combine the TSCD layer and the residual network to extract features suitable for both text extraction stages. The specialized modeling for Chinese characters in the TSCD layer simulates the key structure component cognition layer in the psychological model. And the residual mechanism in the residual network simulates the key bidirectional connection among the layers in the psychological model. Through the organic combination of the TSCD layer and the residual network, the extracted features are applicable to both text detection and recognition, as humans do. In evaluation, both text detection and recognition models based on our proposed text structure feature extractor achieve great improvements over baseline CNN models. And an end-to-end Chinese text information extraction system is experimentally designed and evaluated, showing the advantage of the proposed feature extractor as a unified feature extractor.",

        "abstract": "In vivo imaging of \u03b1v\u03b23 expression has important diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Multimeric cyclic RGD peptides are capable of improving the integrin \u03b1v\u03b2 3-binding affinity due to the polyvalency effect. Here we report an example of 18F-labeled tetrameric RGD peptide for PET of \u03b1v\u03b23 expression in both xenograft and spontaneous tumor models. Methods: The tetrameric RGD peptide E{E[c(RGDyK)] 2}2 was derived with amino-3,6,9-trioxaundecanoic acid (mini-PEG; PEG is poly(ethylene glycol)) linker through the glutamate \u03b1-amino group. NH2-mini-PEG-E{E[c(RGDyK)]2} 2 (PRGD4) was labeled with 18F via the N-succinimidyl-4-18F-fluorobenzoate (18F-SFB) prosthetic group. The receptor-binding characteristics of the tetrameric RGD peptide tracer 18F-FPRGD4 were evaluated in vitro by a cell-binding assay and in vivo by quantitative microPET imaging studies. Results: The decay-corrected radiochemical yield for 18F-FPRGD4 was about 15%, with a total reaction time of 180 min starting from 18F-F-. The PEGylation had minimal effect on integrin-binding affinity of the RGD peptide. 18F-FPRGD4 has significantly higher tumor uptake compared with monomeric and dimeric RGD peptide tracer analogs. The receptor specificity of 18F-FPRGD4 in vivo was confirmed by effective blocking of the uptake in both tumors and normal organs or tissues with excess c(RGDyK). Conclusion: The tetrameric RGD peptide tracer 18F-FPRGD4 possessing high integrin-binding affinity and favorable biokinetics is a promising tracer for PET of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression in cancer and other angiogenesis related diseases.

In the present study, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were coated with a PEGylated amphiphilic triblock copolymer, making them water soluble and function-extendable. These particles were then conjugated with a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye IRDye800 and cyclic Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) containing peptide c(RGDyK) for integrin alpha(v)beta(3) targeting. In vitro binding assays confirmed the integrin-specific association between the RGD-particle adducts and U87MG glioblastoma cells. Successful tumor homing in vivo was perceived in a subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model by both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and NIRF imaging. Ex vivo histopathological studies also revealed low particle accumulation in the liver, which was attributed to their compact hydrodynamic size and PEGylated coating. In conclusion, we have developed a novel RGD-IONP conjugate with excellent tumor integrin targeting efficiency and specificity as well as limited RES uptake for molecular MRI.",

Generator-based PET isotope 68Ga, with a half-life of 68\u00a0min and 89% positron emission, deserves special attention because of its independence of an onsite\n cyclotron. The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of 68Ga-labeled RGD peptides for tumor imaging.\n \n \n \n Methods\u00a0\u00a0Three cyclic RGD peptides, c(RGDyK) (RGD1), E[c(RGDyK)]2 (RGD2), and E{E[c(RGDyK)]2}2 (RGD4), were conjugated with macrocyclic chelator 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) and labeled with 68Ga. Integrin affinity and specificity of the peptide conjugates were assessed by cell-based receptor binding assay, and the\n tumor targeting efficacy of 68Ga-labeled RGD peptides was evaluated in a subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model.\n \n \n \n Results\u00a0\u00a0U87MG cell-based receptor binding assay using 125I-echistatin as radioligand showed that integrin affinity followed the order of NOTA\u2013RGD4 > NOTA\u2013RGD2 > NOTA\u2013RGD1. All three\n NOTA conjugates allowed nearly quantitative 68Ga-labeling within 10\u00a0min (12\u201317\u00a0MBq/nmol). Quantitative microPET imaging studies showed that 68Ga-NOTA\u2013RGD4 had the highest tumor uptake but also prominent activity accumulation in the kidneys. 68Ga-NOTA\u2013RGD2 had higher tumor uptake (e.g., 2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%ID/g at 1\u00a0h postinjection) and similar pharmacokinetics (4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 tumor/muscle\n ratio, 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 tumor/liver ratio, and 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 tumor/kidney ratio) compared with 68Ga-NOTA\u2013RGD1.\n \n \n \n Conclusions\u00a0\u00a0The dimeric RGD peptide tracer 68Ga-NOTA\u2013RGD2 with good tumor uptake and favorable pharmacokinetics warrants further investigation for potential clinical translation\n to image integrin \u03b1v\u03b23.",

        "abstract": "In this report, we present the synthesis and evaluation of the (99m)Tc-labeled beta-Ala-BN(7-14)NH2 (ABN = beta-Ala-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2) as a new radiotracer for tumor imaging in the BALB/c nude mice bearing HT-29 human colon cancer xenografts. The gastrin releasing peptide receptor binding affinity of ABN and HYNIC-ABN (6-hydrazinonicotinamide) was assessed via a competitive displacement of (125)I-[Tyr4]BBN bound to the PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells. The IC 50 values were calculated to be 24 +/- 2 nM and 38 +/- 1 nM for ABN and HYNIC-ABN, respectively. HYNIC is the bifunctional coupling agent for (99m)Tc-labeling, while tricine and TPPTS (trisodium triphenylphosphine-3,3',3''-trisulfonate) are used as coligands to prepare the ternary ligand complex [(99m)Tc(HYNIC-ABN)(tricine)(TPPTS)] in very high yield and high specific activity. Because of its high hydrophilicity (log P = -2.39 +/- 0.06), [(99m)Tc(HYNIC-ABN)(tricine)(TPPS)] was excreted mainly through the renal route with little radioactivity accumulation in the liver, lungs, stomach, and gastrointestinal tract. The tumor uptake at 30 min postinjection (p.i.) was 1.59 +/- 0.23%ID/g with a steady tumor washout over the 4 h study period. As a result, it had the best T/ B ratios in the blood (2.37 +/- 0.68), liver (1.69 +/- 0.41), and muscle (11.17 +/- 3.32) at 1 h p.i. Most of the injected radioactivity was found in the urine sample at 1 h p.i., and there was no intact [(99m)Tc(HYNIC-ABN)(tricine)(TPPTS)] detectable in the urine, kidney, and liver samples. Its metabolic instability may contribute to its rapid clearance from the liver, lungs, and stomach. Despite the steady radioactivity washout, the tumors could be clearly visualized in planar images of the BALB/c nude mice bearing the HT-29 human colon xenografts at 1 and 4 h p.i. The favorable excretion kinetics from the liver, lungs, stomach, and gastrointestinal tract makes [(99m)Tc(HYNIC-ABN)(tricine)(TPPTS)] a promising SPECT radiotracer for imaging colon cancer.",

Here we report the first example, to our knowledge, of (64)Cu-labeled vascular endothelial growth factor 121 (VEGF(121)) for PET of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) expression in vivo.VEGF(121) was conjugated with 1,4,7,10-tetraazadodecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and then labeled with (64)Cu for small-animal PET of mice bearing different sized U87MG human glioblastoma xenografts. Blocking experiments and ex vivo histopathology were performed to confirm the in vivo results.There were 4.3 +/- 0.2 DOTA molecules per VEGF(121), and the VEGFR2 binding affinity of DOTA-VEGF(121) was comparable to VEGF(121). (64)Cu labeling of DOTA-VEGF(121) was achieved in 90 +/- 10 min and the radiolabeling yield was 87.4% +/- 3.2%. The specific activity of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) was 3.2 +/- 0.1 GBq/mg with a radiochemical purity of >98%. Small-animal PET revealed rapid, specific, and prominent uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) in small U87MG tumors (high VEGFR2 expression) but significantly lower and sporadic uptake in large U87MG tumors (low VEGFR2 expression). No appreciable renal clearance of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) was observed, although the kidney uptake was relatively high likely due to VEGFR1 expression. Blocking experiments, immunofluorescence staining, and western blot confirmed the VEGFR specificity of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121).Successful demonstration of the ability of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) to visualize VEGFR expression in vivo may allow for clinical translation of this radiopharmaceutical for imaging tumor angiogenesis and guiding antiangiogenic treatment, especially patient selection and treatment monitoring of VEGFR-targeted cancer therapy.",

Studies showed that these particles are highly crystalline, monodisperse, bioengineerable and have high magnetism that is comparable to those made by advanced synthetic methods, making them candidate materials for a broad range of bio-applications. In this review article, the history of the discovery of MTB and subsequent efforts to elucidate the mechanisms behind the magnetosome formation are briefl y covered.

The aim of this study was to develop a VEGFR-2-specific PET tracer.The D63AE64AE67A mutant of VEGF(121) (VEGF(DEE)) was generated by recombinant DNA technology. VEGF(121) and VEGF(DEE) were purified and conjugated with DOTA for (64)Cu labeling. The DOTA conjugates were tested in vitro for VEGFR-2 specificity and functional activity. In vivo tumor targeting efficacy and pharmacokinetics of (64)Cu-labeled VEGF(121) and VEGF(DEE) were compared using an orthotopic 4T1 murine breast tumor model. Blocking experiments, biodistribution studies, and immunofluorescence staining were carried out to confirm the noninvasive imaging results.Cell binding assay demonstrated that VEGF(DEE) had about 20-fold lower VEGFR-1 binding affinity and only slightly lower VEGFR-2 binding affinity as compared with VEGF(121). MicroPET imaging studies revealed that both (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) and (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(DEE) had rapid and prominent activity accumulation in VEGFR-2-expressing 4T1 tumors. The renal uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(DEE) was significantly lower than that of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) as rodent kidneys expressed high levels of VEGFR-1 based on immunofluorescence staining. Blocking experiments and biodistribution studies confirmed the VEGFR specificity of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(DEE).We have developed a VEGFR-2-specific PET tracer, (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(DEE). It has comparable tumor targeting efficacy to (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) but much reduced renal toxicity.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to synthesize, characterize and tailor the surface properties of magnetic nanoparticles with biocompatible copolymer coatings and to evaluate the efficiency of the resulting nanoconjugates as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents for liver imaging. Magnetic nanoparticles with core diameters of 10 and 30 nm were synthesized by pyrolysis and were subsequently coated with a copolymer containing either carboxyl (SHP) or methoxy groups as termini. All four formulas, and ferumoxides (Feridex I.V.(\u00ae)), were individually injected intravenously into separate, normal Balb/C mice (at 2.5, 1.0 and 0.56 mg Fe kg(-1)), and the animals underwent T(2)-weighted MRI at multiple time points post injection (p.i.) to evaluate the hepatic uptake and clearance. Furthermore, we compared the abilities of the new formulas and Feridex to detect tumors in an orthotropic Huh7 tumor model. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a narrow size distribution of both the 10 and 30 nm nanoparticles, in contrast to a wide size distribution of Feridex. MTT, apoptosis and cyclin/DNA flow cytometry assays showed that the polymer coated nanoparticles had no adverse effect on cell growth. Among all the tested formulas, including Feridex, SHP-30 showed the highest macrophage uptake at the in vitro level. In vivo MRI studies on normal mice confirmed the superiority of SHP-30 in inducing hypointensities in the liver tissue, especially at clinical dose (0.56 mg Fe kg(-1)) and 3\u2009T field. SHP-30 showed better contrast-to-noise ratio than Feridex on the orthotropic Huh7 tumor model. SHP-30 was found to be an efficient contrast agent for liver MR imaging. The success of this study suggests that, by improving the synthetic approach and by tuning the surface properties of IONPs, one can arrive at better formulas than Feridex for clinical practice.",

A phantom study was used to assess the efficacy of PASP-IO as a T2-weighted MRI contrast agent. PASP-IO nanoparticles with surface amino groups were coupled to cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) peptides for integrin alphavbeta3 targeting and macrocyclic 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N''',-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelators for PET after labeling with 64Cu. IO nanoparticle conjugates were further tested in vitro and in vivo to determine receptor targeting efficacy and feasibility for dual PET/MRI.PASP-IO nanoparticles made by single-step reaction have a core size of 5 nm with a hydrodynamic diameter of 45 +/- 10 nm. The saturation magnetization of PASP-IO nanoparticles is about 117 emu/g of iron, and the measured r2 and r2* are 105.5 and 165.5 (s.mM)(-1), respectively. A displacement competitive binding assay indicates that DOTA-IO-RGD conjugates bound specifically to integrin alphavbeta3 in vitro. Both small-animal PET and T2-weighted MRI show integrin-specific delivery of conjugated RGD-PASP-IO nanoparticles and prominent reticuloendothelial system uptake.We have successfully developed an IO-based nanoprobe for simultaneous dual PET and MRI of tumor integrin expression. The success of this bifunctional imaging approach may allow for earlier tumor detection with a high degree of accuracy and provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of cancer.",

        "abstract": "Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging is an emerging imaging technique for studying diseases at the molecular level. Optical imaging with a NIR emitting fluorophore for targeting tumor vasculature offers a noninvasive method for early detection of tumor angiogenesis and efficient monitoring of response to anti-tumor vasculature therapy. The previous in vitro results demonstrated that the GX1 peptide, identified by phage-display technology, is a tumor vasculature endothelium-specific ligand. In this report, Cy5.5-conjugated GX1 peptide was evaluated in a subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model to investigate tumor-targeting efficacy. The in vitro flow cytometry results revealed dose-dependent binding of Cy5.5-GX1 peptide to U87MG glioma cells. In vivo optical imaging with the Cy5.5-GX1 probe exhibited rapid U87MG tumor targeting at 0.5 h p.i., and high tumor-to-background contrast at 4 h p.i. Tumor specificity of Cy5.5-GX1 was confirmed by effective blocking of tumor uptake in the presence of unlabeled GX1 peptide (20 mg/kg). Ex vivo imaging further confirmed in vivo imaging findings, and demonstrated that Cy5.5-GX1 has a tumor-to-muscle ratio (15.21 \u00b1 0.84) at 24 h p.i. for the non-blocked group and significantly decreased ratio (6.95 \u00b1 0.75) for the blocked group. In conclusion, our studies suggest that Cy5.5-GX1 is a promising molecular probe for optical imaging of tumor vasculature.",

The tumor imaging ability of 64Cu-PTSM and 64Cu-PEI was investigated in U87MG human glioblastoma xenograft model. 64Cu-PEI-polyethylene glycol (PEG) was also synthesized, and the cell uptake, efflux, cytotoxicity, and the biodistribution\n were carried out and compared with 64Cu-PEI.\n \n \n \n Results\u00a0\u00a0Both 64Cu-PEI and 64Cu-PEI-PEG were obtained in high labeling yield without the need of macrocyclic chelating agents. 64Cu-PEI showed lower cell labeling efficiency than 64Cu-PTSM. Small-animal PET images of living mice indicate that tail-vein-injected U87MG cells labeled with 64Cu-PTSM or 64Cu-PEI traffic to the lungs and liver. In a subcutaneous U87MG xenograft model, 64Cu-PEI had higher tumor uptake (18.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 %ID/g at 24\u00a0h) than 64Cu-PTSM (12.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 %ID/g at 24\u00a0h).

        "abstract": "The use of quantum dots (QDs) in biomedical research has grown tremendously, yet successful examples of clinical applications are absent due to many clinical concerns. Here, we report on a new type of stable and biocompatible dendron-coated InP/ZnS core/shell QD as a clinically translatable nanoprobe for molecular imaging applications. The QDs (QD710-Dendron) were demonstrated to hold several significant features: near-infrared (NIR) emission, high stability in biological media, suitable size with possible renal clearance, and ability of extravasation. More importantly, a pilot mouse toxicity study confirmed that QD710-Dendron lacks significant toxicity at the doses tested. The acute tumor uptake of QD710-Dendron resulted in good contrast from the surrounding nontumorous tissues, indicating the possibility of passive targeting of the QDs. The highly specific targeting of QD710-Dendron-RGD(2) to integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3)-positive tumor cells resulted in high tumor uptake and long retention of the nanoprobe at tumor sites. In summary, QD710-Dendron and RGD-modified nanoparticles demonstrate small size, high stability, biocompatibility, favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics, and successful tumor imaging properties. These features satisfy the requirements for clinical translation and should promote efforts to further investigate the possibility of using QD710-Dendron-based nanoprobes in the clinical setting in the near future.",

Here, we investigate the biodistribution of radio-labelled SWNTs in mice by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET), ex vivo biodistribution and Raman spectroscopy. It is found that SWNTs that are functionalized with phospholipids bearing polyethylene-glycol (PEG) are surprisingly stable in vivo. The effect of PEG chain length on the biodistribution and circulation of the SWNTs is studied. Effectively PEGylated SWNTs exhibit relatively long blood circulation times and low uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Efficient targeting of integrin positive tumour in mice is achieved with SWNTs coated with PEG chains linked to an arginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartic acid (RGD) peptide. A high tumour accumulation is attributed to the multivalent effect of the SWNTs. The Raman signatures of SWNTs are used to directly probe the presence of nanotubes in mice tissues and confirm the radio-label-based results.",

        "abstract": "The cell adhesion molecule integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 plays a key role in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. A series of 18F-labeled RGD peptides have been developed for PET of integrin expression based on primary amine reactive prosthetic groups. In this study, we report the use of the Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition, also known as a click reaction, to label RGD peptides with 18F by forming 1,2,3-triazoles. Nucleophilic fluorination of a toluenesulfonic alkyne provided 18F-alkyne in high yield (nondecay-corrected yield: 65.0 \u00b1 1.9%, starting from the azeotropically dried 18F-fluoride), which was then reacted with an RGD azide (nondecay-corrected yield: 52.0 \u00b1 8.3% within 45 min including HPLC purification). The 18F-labeled peptide was subjected to microPET studies in murine xenograft models. Murine microPET experiments showed good tumor uptake (2.1 \u00b1 0.4%ID/g at 1 h postinjection (p.i.)) with rapid renal and hepatic clearance of 18F-fluoro-PEG- triazoles-RGD2 (18F-FPTA-RGD2) in a subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model (kidney 2.7 \u00b1 0.8%ID/g; liver 1.9 \u00b1 0.4%ID/g at 1 h p.i.). Metabolic stability of the newly synthesized tracer was also analyzed (intact tracer ranging from 75% to 99% at 1 h p.i.). In brief, the new tracer 18F-FPTA-RGD2 was synthesized with high radiochemical yield and high specific activity. This tracer exhibited good tumor-targeting efficacy and relatively good metabolic stability, as well as favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics. This new 18F labeling method based on click reaction may also be useful for radiolabeling of other biomolecules with azide groups in high yield. \u00a9 2007 American Chemical Society.",

Dimerization and multimerization of cyclic RGD peptides have been reported\n to improve the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-binding affinity due to the polyvalency effect. Here, we compared a number of new dimeric RGD peptide tracers with the clinically\n used 18F-galacto-RGD.\n \n \n \n \n Procedures\u00a0\u00a0RGD monomers and dimers were coupled with galacto or PEG3 linkers, and labeled with 18F using 4-nitrophenyl 2-18F-fluoropropionate (18F-NFP) or N-succinimidyl 4-18F-fluorobenzoate as a prosthetic group. The newly developed tracers were evaluated by cell-based receptor-binding assay, biodistribution,\n and small-animal PET studies in a subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model.\n \n \n \n \n Results\u00a0\u00a0Starting with 18F-F\u2212, the total reaction time for 18F-FP-SRGD2 and 18F-FP-PRGD2 is about 120\u00a0min. The decay-corrected radiochemical yields for 18F-FP-SRGD2 and 18F-FP-PRGD2 are 52\u2009\u00b1\u20099% and 80\u2009\u00b1\u20097% calculated from 18F-NFP. Noninvasive small-animal PET and direct tissue sampling experiments demonstrated that the dimeric RGD peptides had\n significantly higher tumor uptake as compared to 18F-galacto-RGD.\n \n \n \n \n Conclusion\u00a0\u00a0Dimeric RGD peptide tracers with relatively high tumor integrin-specific accumulation and favorable in vivo kinetics may have the potential to be translated into clinic for integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 imaging.",

        "abstract": "This article reported the high tumor targeting efficacy of RGD peptide labeled near-infrared (NIR) non-cadmium quantum dots (QDs). After using poly(ethylene glycol) to encapsulate InAs/InP/ZnSe QDs (emission maximum at about 800 nm), QD800-PEG dispersed well in PBS buffer with the hydrodynamic diameter (HD) of 15.9 nm and the circulation half-life of approximately 29 min. After coupling QD800-PEG with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) or arginine-alanine-aspartic acid (RAD) peptides, we used nude mice bearing subcutaneous U87MG tumor as models to test tumor-targeted fluorescence imaging. The results indicated that the tumor uptake of QD800-RGD is much higher than those of QD800-PEG and QD800-RAD. The semiquantitative analysis of the region of interest (ROI) showed a high tumor uptake of 10.7 +/- 1.5%ID/g in mice injected with QD800-RGD, while the tumor uptakes of QD800-PEG and QD800-RAD were 2.9 +/- 0.3%ID/g and 4.0 +/- 0.5%ID/g, respectively, indicating the specific tumor targeting of QD800-RGD. The high reproducibility of bioconjunction between QDs and the RGD peptide and the feasibility of QD-RGD bioconjugates as tumor-targeted fluorescence probes warrant the successful application of QDs for in vivo molecular imaging.",

Molecular imaging probes based on dual-receptor\n targeting peptide heterodimers exhibit improved tumor targeting efficacy for multi-receptor expressing tumors compared with\n their parent single-receptor targeting peptide monomers. Previously we have developed bombesin (BBN)-RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide\n heterodimers, in which BBN and RGD are covalently connected with an asymmetric glutamate linker (J Med Chem 52:425\u2013432, 2009).\n Although 18F-labeled heterodimers showed significantly better microPET imaging quality than 18F-labeled RGD and BBN monomers in a PC-3 xenograft model which co-expresses gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) and\n integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, tedious heterodimer synthesis due to the asymmetric nature of glutamate linker restricts their clinical applications.\n In this study, we report the use of a symmetric linker AEADP [AEADP\u00a0=\u00a03,3\u2032-(2-aminoethylazanediyl)dipropanoic acid] for the\n synthesis of BBN-RGD peptide heterodimer. The 18F-labeled heterodimer (18F-FB-AEADP-BBN-RGD) showed comparable microPET imaging results with glutamate linked BBN-RGD heterodimers, indicating that\n the replacement of glutamate linker with AEADP linker did not affect the biological activities of BBN-RGD heterodimer.

Tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurement. During the therapeutic period, longitudinal PET scans were acquired using (18)F-FDG, (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FPPRGD2 as imaging tracers to evaluate tumor glucose metabolism, tumor cell proliferation, and angiogenesis, respectively. Imaging metrics were validated by immunohistochemical analysis of Ki67, GLUT-1, F4/80, CD31, murine integrin \u03b23, and human integrin \u03b1v\u03b23.Three consecutive daily oral administrations of 100 mg/kg of ZD4190 were effective in delaying MDA-MB-435 tumor growth. A significant difference in tumor volume was observed on day 7 between the treatment group and the control group (p < 0.01). After the final treatment, tumor growth resumed after a short delay. In the control tumors, (18)F-FPPRGD2 uptake was stable between days 0 and 7. In ZD4190-treated tumors, (18)F-FPPRGD2 uptake had decreased significantly relative to baseline by 26.74 \u00b1 8.12% (p < 0.05) on day 1 and by 41.19 \u00b1 6.63% (p < 0.01) on day 3, then had returned to baseline on day 7. Tumor uptake of (18)F-FLT had also decreased on both day 1 and day 3 after initiation of ZD4190 treatment. No significant change in (18)F-FDG uptake in ZD4190-treated tumors was observed, however, compared with the control group. All of the imaging findings were supported by ex vivo analysis of related biomarkers.The longitudinal imaging results demonstrated the usefulness of quantitative (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FPPRGD2 PET imaging in evaluating the early antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects of ZD4190. The quantification data from the PET imaging were consistent with the pattern of initial growth inhibition with treatment, followed by tumor relapse after treatment cessation.",

        "abstract": "EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase is significantly overexpressed in a wide variety of cancer types. High EphA2 expression has been correlated with increased metastatic potential and poor patient survival. Although many recent reports have focused on blocking the EphA2 signaling pathway in cancer, the in vivo imaging of EphA2 has not yet been investigated.We labeled 1C1, a humanized monoclonal antibody against both human and murine EphA2, with (64)Cu through the chelating agent 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and carried out positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of eight tumor models with different EphA2 expression levels. Western blotting of tumor tissue lysate was performed to correlate the EphA2 expression level with (64)Cu-DOTA-1C1 uptake in the tumors. Immunofluorescence staining and biodistribution studies were also carried out to validate the in vivo results.The radiolabeling yield was 88.9 +/- 9.5% (n = 7) and the specific activity of (64)Cu-DOTA-1C1 was 1.32 +/- 0.14 GBq/mg of 1C1 mAb. The antibody retained antigen-binding affinity/specificity after DOTA conjugation as measured by FACS analysis. The uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-1C1 in CT-26 tumors was as high as 25.1 +/- 2.5 %ID/g (n = 3) at 18 h post injection. (64)Cu-DOTA-IgG, an isotype-matched control, exhibited minimal non-specific uptake in all eight tumor models. In vivo EphA2 specificity of (64)Cu-DOTA-1C1 was confirmed by successful blocking of CT-26 tumor uptake by unlabeled 1C1. Most importantly, the tumor uptake value obtained from PET imaging had excellent linear correlation with the relative tumor tissue EphA2 expression level measured by Western blot, where r (2) equals 0.90 and 0.92 at 18 h and 42 h post injection, respectively.The tumor uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-1C1 measured by microPET imaging reflects tumor EphA2 expression level in vivo. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of quantitative radioimmunoPET imaging of EphA2 in living subjects. Future clinical investigation of (64)Cu-DOTA-1C1 is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Integrin avb3 plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis and me- tastasis. Suitably radiolabeled cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) peptides can be used for noninvasive imaging of avb3 ex- pression and targeted radionuclide therapy. In this study, we de- veloped 64Cu-labeledmultimeric RGDpeptides, EfE(c(RGDyK))2g2 (RGD tetramer) and E(EfE(c(RGDyK))2g2)2 (RGD octamer), for PET imaging of tumor integrin avb3 expression. Methods: Both RGD tetramer and RGD octamer were synthesized with glutamate as the linker. After conjugation with 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-N, N9,N$,N$9-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), the peptides were labeled with 64Cu for biodistribution and small-animal PET imaging studies (U87MG human glioblastoma xenograft model and c-neu onco- mouse model). A cell adhesion assay, a cell-binding assay, recep- tor blocking experiments, and immunohistochemistry were also performed to evaluate the avb3-binding affinity/specificity of the RGD peptide-based conjugates in vitro and in vivo. Results: RGD octamer had significantly higher integrin avb3-binding affinity and specificity than RGD tetramer analog (inhibitory concentration of50%was10nMforoctamervs.35nMfortetramer). 64Cu-DOTA- RGD octamer had higher tumor uptake and longer tumor retention than 64Cu-DOTA-RGD tetramer in both tumor models tested. The integrin avb3specificity of both tracers was confirmed by success- ful receptor-blockingexperiments. Thehighuptake andslowclear- ance of 64Cu-DOTA-RGD octamer in the kidneys was attributed mainly to the integrin positivity of the kidneys, significantly higher integrin avb3-binding affinity, and the larger molecular size of the octamer, as compared with the other RGD analogs. Conclusion: Polyvalency has a profound effect on the receptor-binding affinity",

The development of a dual-function PET/near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) probe can allow for accurate assessment of the pharmacokinetics and tumor-targeting efficacy of QDs.A QD with an amine-functionalized surface was modified with RGD peptides and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclodocecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelators for integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-targeted PET/NIRF imaging. A cell-binding assay and fluorescence cell staining were performed with U87MG human glioblastoma cells (integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-positive). PET/NIRF imaging, tissue homogenate fluorescence measurement, and immunofluorescence staining were performed with U87MG tumor-bearing mice to quantify the probe uptake in the tumor and major organs.There are about 90 RGD peptides per QD particle, and DOTA-QD-RGD exhibited integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-specific binding in cell cultures. The U87MG tumor uptake of (64)Cu-labeled DOTA-QD was less than 1 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g), significantly lower than that of (64)Cu-labeled DOTA-QD-RGD (2.2 +/- 0.3 [mean +/- SD] and 4.0 +/- 1.0 %ID/g at 5 and 18 h after injection, respectively; n = 3). Taking into account all measurements, the liver-, spleen-, and kidney-to-muscle ratios for (64)Cu-labeled DOTA-QD-RGD were about 100:1, 40:1, and 1:1, respectively. On the basis of the PET results, the U87MG tumor-to-muscle ratios for DOTA-QD-RGD and DOTA-QD were about 4:1 and 1:1, respectively. Excellent linear correlation was obtained between the results measured by in vivo PET imaging and those measured by ex vivo NIRF imaging and tissue homogenate fluorescence (r(2) = 0.93). Histologic examination revealed that DOTA-QD-RGD targets primarily the tumor vasculature through an RGD-integrin alpha(v)beta(3) interaction, with little extravasation.We quantitatively evaluated the tumor-targeting efficacy of a dual-function QD-based probe with PET and NIRF imaging. This dual-function probe has significantly reduced potential toxicity and overcomes the tissue penetration limitation of optical imaging, allowing for quantitative targeted imaging in deep tissue.",

Biodistribution studies, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot were performed to validate the microPET results.PC-3 cells are sensitive to 17-AAG treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitative microPET showed that (64)Cu-DOTA-cetuximab has prominent tumor activity accumulation in untreated tumors (14.6 +/- 2.6%ID/g) but significantly lower uptake in 17-AAG-treated tumors (8.9 +/- 1.6% ID/g) at 24 h post-injection. Both immunofluorescence staining and Western blot confirmed the significantly lower EGFR expression level in the tumor tissue upon 17-AAG treatment.The early response to anti-Hsp90 therapy was successfully monitored by quantitative PET using (64)Cu-DOTA-cetuximab, which indicates that this approach may be valuable in monitoring the therapeutic response to Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG in EGFR-positive cancer patients.",

InAs/InP/ZnSe QDs coated by mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) exhibit an emission wavelength of about 800 nm (QD800-MPA) with very small hydrodynamic diameter (<10 nm). Using 22B and LS174T tumor xenograft models, in vivo and ex vivo imaging studies show that QD800-MPA is highly accumulated in the tumor area, which is very promising for tumor detection in living mice. The ex vivo elemental analysis (Indium) using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry confirm the tumor uptake of QDs. The ICP data are consistent with the in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging. Human serum albumin (HSA)-coated QD800-MPA nanoparticles (QD800-MPA-HSA) show reduced localization in mononuclear phagocytic system-related organs over QD800-MPA plausibly due to the low uptake of QD800-MPA-HSA in macrophage cells. QD800-MPA-HSA may have great potential for in vivo fluorescence imaging.",

        "abstract": "Molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers targeted to tumor vasculature offers a noninvasive method for early detection of tumor angiogenesis and efficient monitoring of response to anti-tumor vasculature therapy. The previous in vitro results demonstrated that the GX1 peptide, identified by phage display technology, is a tumor vasculature endothelium-specific ligand. In this study, we evaluated a \u2076\u2074Cu-labeled GX1 peptide as a potential radiotracer for microPET imaging of tumor vasculature in a U87MG tumor xenografted mouse model.Macrocyclic chelating agent 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N, N', N'', N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-conjugated GX1 peptide was synthesized and radiolabeled with \u2076\u2074Cu (t(1/2)\u2009=\u200912.7 h) in ammonium acetate buffer. The \u2076\u2074Cu-labeled GX1 peptide was then subjected to in vitro tumor cell uptake study, small animal PET and direct tissue sampling biodistribution studies in a U87MG tumor xenografted mouse model.The in vitro experiment demonstrated that \u2076\u2074Cu-DOTA-GX1 is stable in PBS with more than 91% of \u2076\u2074Cu-DOTA-GX1 peptide remaining intact after 24 h of incubation. Cellular uptake and retention studies revealed (64)Cu-DOTA-GX1 binds to U87MG glioma cells and has good tumor cell retention. For small animal PET imaging studies, the U87MG tumors were all clearly visible with high contrast to contralateral background at all measured time points after injection of \u2076\u2074Cu-DOTA-GX1 while high accumulation in liver and kidneys were also observed at early time points. The U87MG tumor uptake was determined to be the highest (7.97\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75%ID/g) at 24 h pi. The blocking experiment was achieved by co-injection of \u2076\u2074Cu-DOTA-GX1 with non-radiolabeled GX1 peptide (20 mg/kg) at 24 h pi, suggesting \u2076\u2074Cu-DOTA-GX1 is a target-specific tracer. Furthermore, the biodistribution results were consistent with the quantification of microPET imaging, demonstrating the highest ratio (16.09\u2009\u00b1\u20091.21) of tumor/muscle uptake of \u2076\u2074Cu-DOTA-GX1 at 24 h pi for non-blocking group and significant decreased ratio (6.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58) for blocking group. Finally, metabolic studies suggested that \u2076\u2074Cu-DOTA-GX1 is stable in mouse blood and urine in vivo at early time point while the metal transchelation may also occur in mouse liver and kidneys.Our studies demonstrate that \u2076\u2074Cu-DOTA-GX1 is a promising radiotracer for imaging tumor vasculature.",

The principal goal of PET imaging is to visualize, characterize, and measure biological processes at the cellular, subcellular, and molecular levels in living subjects using noninvasive procedures. PET imaging takes advantage of the traditional diagnostic imaging techniques and introduces positron-emitting probes to determine the expression of indicative molecular targets at different stages of cancer progression. Although [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG)-PET has been widely utilized for staging and restaging of cancer, evaluation of response to treatment, differentiation of post-therapy alterations from residual or recurrent tumor, and assessment of prognosis, [(18)F]FDG is not a target-specific PET tracer. Over the last decade, numerous target-specific PET tracers have been developed and evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. This review provides an overview of the current status and trends in the development of non-[(18)F]FDG PET probes in oncology and their application in the investigation of cancer biology.",

In this study, we evaluated the role of integrin alpha(v)beta(3) in breast cancer cell resistance to ionizing irradiation (IR) and tested the anti-tumor efficacy of combining integrin alpha(v) siRNA and IR. Colonogenic survival assay, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle analysis were carried out to determine the treatment effect of siRNA, IR, or combination of both on MDA-MB-435 cells (integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-positive). Integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-negative MCF-7 cells exert more radiosensitivity than MDA-MB-435 cells. IR up-regulates integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression in MDA-MB-435 cells and integrin alpha(v) siRNA can effectively reduce both alpha(v) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrin expression, leading to increased radiosensitivity. Integrin alpha(v) siRNA also promotes IR-induced apoptosis and enhances IR-induced G2/M arrest in cell cycle progression. This study, with further optimization, may provide a simple and highly efficient treatment strategy for breast cancer as well as other integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-positive cancer types.",

        "abstract": "Molecular imaging, the visualization, characterization and measurement of biological processes at the cellular, subcellular level, or even molecular level in living subjects, has rapidly gained importance in the dawning era of personalized medicine. Molecular imaging takes advantage of the traditional diagnostic imaging techniques and introduces molecular imaging probes to determine the expression of indicative molecular markers at different stages of diseases and disorders. As a key component of molecular imaging, molecular imaging probe must be able to specifically reach the target of interest in vivo while retaining long enough to be detected. A desirable molecular imaging probe with clinical translation potential is expected to have unique characteristics. Therefore, design and development of molecular imaging probe is frequently a challenging endeavor for medicinal chemists. This review summarizes the general principles of molecular imaging probe design and some fundamental strategies of molecular imaging probe development with a number of illustrative examples.",

        "abstract": "Purpose\u00a0\u00a0Cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of cancer cells,\n was approved by the FDA to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. It is currently also in advanced-stage development\n for the treatment of several other solid tumors. Here we report for the first time the quantitative positron emission tomography\n (PET) imaging of EGFR expression in xenograft-bearing mice using 64Cu-labeled cetuximab.\n \n \n \n Methods\u00a0\u00a0We conjugated cetuximab with macrocyclic chelating agent 1,4,7,10-tetraazadodecane-N,N\u2032,N\u2032\u2032,N\u2032\u2032\u2032-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), labeled with 64Cu, and tested the resulting 64Cu-DOTA-cetuximab in seven xenograft tumor models. The tracer uptake measured by PET was correlated with the EGFR expression\n quantified by western blotting. The estimated human dosimetry based on the PET data in Sprague-Dawley rats was also calculated.\n \n \n \n Results\u00a0\u00a0MicroPET imaging showed that 64Cu-DOTA-cetuximab had increasing tumor activity accumulation over time in EGFR-positive tumors but relatively low uptake in\n EGFR-negative tumors at all times examined (R\n 2\u2009=\u20090.80) between the tracer uptake (measured by PET) and the EGFR expression level (measured by western blotting). Human dosimetry\n estimation indicated that the tracer may be safely administered to human patients for tumor diagnosis, with the dose-limiting\n organ being the liver.\n \n \n \n Conclusion\u00a0\u00a0The success of EGFR-positive tumor imaging using 64Cu-DOTA-cetuximab can be translated into the clinic to characterize the pharmacokinetics, to select the right population of\n patients for EGFR-targeted therapy, to monitor the therapeutic efficacy of anti-EGFR treatment, and to optimize the dosage\n of either cetuximab alone or cetuximab in combination with other therapeutic agents.",

Blakemore in 1975, and this led to the discovery of a wide collection of microorganisms with similar features i.e., the ability to internalize Fe and convert it into magnetic nanoparticles, in the form of either magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) or greigite (Fe(3)S(4)). Studies showed that these particles are highly crystalline, monodisperse, bioengineerable and have high magnetism that is comparable to those made by advanced synthetic methods, making them candidate materials for a broad range of bio-applications. In this review article, the history of the discovery of MTB and subsequent efforts to elucidate the mechanisms behind the magnetosome formation are briefly covered. The focus is on how to utilize the knowledge gained from fundamental studies to fabricate functional MTB nanoparticles (MTB-NPs) that are capable of tackling real biomedical problems.",

        "abstract": "To date, the in vivo imaging of quantum dots (QDs) has been mostly qualitative or semiquantitative. The development of a dual-function positron emission tomography (PET)/near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) probe might allow the accurate assessment of the tumor-targeting efficacy of QDs.An amine-functionalized QD was conjugated with VEGF protein and DOTA chelator for VEGFR-targeted PET/NIRF imaging after (64)Cu-labeling. The targeting efficacy of this dual functional probe was evaluated in vitro and in vivo through cell-binding assay, cell staining, in vivo optical/PET imaging, ex vivo optical/PET imaging, and histology.The DOTA-QD-VEGF exhibited VEGFR-specific binding in both cell-binding assay and cell staining experiment. Both NIR fluorescence imaging and microPET showed VEGFR-specific delivery of conjugated DOTA-QD-VEGF nanoparticle and prominent reticuloendothelial system uptake. The U87MG tumor uptake of (64)Cu-labeled DOTA-QD was less than one percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g), significantly lower than that of (64)Cu-labeled DOTA-QD-VEGF (1.52 +/- 0.6%ID/g, 2.81 +/- 0.3%ID/g, 3.84 +/- 0.4%ID/g, and 4.16 +/- 0.5%ID/g at 1, 4, 16, and 24 h post injection, respectively; n = 3). Good correlation was also observed between the results measured by ex vivo PET and NIRF organ imaging. Histologic examination revealed that DOTA-QD-VEGF primarily targets the tumor vasculature through a VEGF-VEGFR interaction.We have successfully developed a QD-based nanoprobe for dual PET and NIRF imaging of tumor VEGFR expression. The success of this bifunctional imaging approach may render higher degree of accuracy for the quantitative targeted NIRF imaging in deep tissue.",

        "abstract": "Purpose\u00a0\u00a0Molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers targeted to tumor vasculature offers a noninvasive\n method for early detection of tumor angiogenesis and efficient monitoring of response to anti-tumor vasculature therapy. The\n previous in vitro results demonstrated that the GX1 peptide, identified by phage display technology, is a tumor vasculature endothelium-specific\n ligand. In this study, we evaluated a 64Cu-labeled GX1 peptide as a potential radiotracer for microPET imaging of tumor vasculature in a U87MG tumor xenografted mouse\n model.\n \n \n \n \n Methods\u00a0\u00a0Macrocyclic chelating agent 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N, N\u2032, N\u2032\u2032, N\u2032\u2032\u2032-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-conjugated GX1 peptide was synthesized and radiolabeled with 64Cu (t\n 1/2\u2009=\u200912.7\u00a0h) in ammonium acetate buffer. The 64Cu-labeled GX1 peptide was then subjected to in vitro tumor cell uptake study, small animal PET and direct tissue sampling biodistribution studies in a U87MG tumor xenografted\n mouse model.\n \n \n \n \n Results\u00a0\u00a0The in vitro experiment demonstrated that 64Cu-DOTA-GX1 is stable in PBS with more than 91% of 64Cu-DOTA-GX1 peptide remaining intact after 24\u00a0h of incubation. Cellular uptake and retention studies revealed 64Cu-DOTA-GX1 binds to U87MG glioma cells and has good tumor cell retention. For small animal PET imaging studies, the U87MG\n tumors were all clearly visible with high contrast to contralateral background at all measured time points after injection\n of 64Cu-DOTA-GX1 while high accumulation in liver and kidneys were also observed at early time points. The U87MG tumor uptake was\n determined to be the highest (7.97\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75%ID/g) at 24\u00a0h pi. The blocking experiment was achieved by co-injection of 64Cu-DOTA-GX1 with non-radiolabeled GX1 peptide (20\u00a0mg/kg) at 24\u00a0h pi, suggesting 64Cu-DOTA-GX1 is a target-specific tracer. Furthermore, the biodistribution results were consistent with the quantification\n of microPET imaging, demonstrating the highest ratio (16.09\u2009\u00b1\u20091.21) of tumor/muscle uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-GX1 at 24\u00a0h pi for non-blocking group and significant decreased ratio (6.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58) for blocking group. Finally, metabolic\n studies suggested that 64Cu-DOTA-GX1 is stable in mouse blood and urine in vivo at early time point while the metal transchelation may also occur in mouse liver and kidneys.\n \n \n \n \n Conclusion\u00a0\u00a0Our studies demonstrate that 64Cu-DOTA-GX1 is a promising radiotracer for imaging tumor vasculature.",

        "abstract": "The effect of nanoparticle size (30-120 nm) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hepatic lesions in vivo has been systematically examined using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (PVP-IOs). Such biocompatible PVP-IOs with different sizes were synthesized by a simple one-pot pyrolysis method. These PVP-IOs exhibited good crystallinity and high T(2) relaxivities, and the relaxivity increased with the size of the magnetic nanoparticles. It was found that cellular uptake changed with both size and surface physiochemical properties, and that PVP-IO-37 with a core size of 37 nm and hydrodynamic particle size of 100 nm exhibited higher cellular uptake rate and greater distribution than other PVP-IOs and Feridex. We systematically investigated the effect of nanoparticle size on MRI of normal liver and hepatic lesions in vivo. The physical and chemical properties of the nanoparticles influenced their pharmacokinetic behavior, which ultimately determined their ability to accumulate in the liver. The contrast enhancement of PVP-IOs within the liver was highly dependent on the overall size of the nanoparticles, and the 100 nm PVP-IO-37 nanoparticles exhibited the greatest enhancement. These results will have implications in designing engineered nanoparticles that are optimized as MR contrast agents or for use in therapeutics.",

Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), with their advantages of being non-toxic, biodegradable and inexpensive, are candidate platforms for the buildup of theranostic nanostructures; however, progress in using them has been limited largely due to inefficient drug loading and delivery. In the current study, we utilized dopamine to modify the surface of IONPs, yielding nanoconjugates that can be easily encapsulated into human serum albumin (HSA) matrices (clinically utilized drug carriers). This nanosystem is well-suited for dual encapsulation of IONPs and drug molecules, because the encapsulation is achieved in a way that is similar to common drug loading. To assess the biophysical characteristics of this novel nanosystem, the HSA coated IONPs (HSA-IONPs) were dually labeled with (64)Cu-DOTA and Cy5.5, and tested in a subcutaneous U87MG xenograft mouse model. In vivo positron emission tomography (PET)/near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tri-modality imaging, and ex vivo analyses and histological examinations were carefully conducted to investigate the in vivo behavior of the nanostructures. With the compact HSA coating, the HSA-IONPs manifested a prolonged circulation half-life; more impressively, they showed massive accumulation in lesions, high extravasation rate, and low uptake of the particles by macrophages at the tumor area.",

Quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of VEGFR will facilitate the planning of whether, and when, to start anti-angiogenic treatment and enable more robust and effective monitoring of such treatment.VEGF(121) was conjugated with DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetra-azacylododecane N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid) and then labeled with (64)Cu for PET imaging of mice bearing different-sized human glioblastoma U87MG tumors (n = 15). Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining of tumor tissue was carried out to correlate with/validate the imaging results.The specific activity of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) was 3.2 GBq/mg. The uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) in the tumor peaked when the tumor size was about 100-250 mm(3). Both small and large tumors had lower tracer uptake indicating a narrow range of tumor size with high VEGFR-2 expression. All tumors had similarly low VEGFR-1 expression. Most importantly, the tumor uptake value obtained from PET imaging had good linear correlation with the relative tumor tissue VEGFR-2 expression as measured by Western blot, where r (2) equals 0.68 based on the PET uptake at 4 h post-injection. Histology of the frozen tumor tissue corroborates well with the imaging results.The tumor uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) measured by small-animal PET imaging reflects tumor VEGFR-2 expression level in vivo. Such correlation may facilitate future treatment planning and treatment monitoring of cancer and potentially other angiogenesis-related diseases.",

Alterations of ARs function and expression have been studied in neurological diseases (epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease), cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and inflammation and autoimmune diseases. A series of positron emission tomography (PET) probes for imaging ARs have been developed. The PET imaging probes have provided valuable information for diagnosis and therapy of diseases related to alterations of ARs expression.

        "abstract": "Targeting drugs to receptors involved in tumor angiogenesis has been demonstrated as a novel and promising approach to improve cancer treatment. In this study, we evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of a dimeric RGD peptide-paclitaxel conjugate (RGD2-PTX) in an orthotopic MDA-MB-435 breast cancer model.To assess the effect of conjugation and the presence of drug moiety on the MDA-MB-435 tumor and normal tissue uptake, the biodistribution of (3)H-RGD2-PTX was compared with that of (3)H-PTX. The treatment effect of RGD2-PTX and RGD2+PTX was measured by tumor size, (18)F-FDG/PET, (18)F-FLT/PET, and postmortem histopathology.By comparing the biodistribution of (3)H-RGD2-PTX and (3)H-PTX, we found that (3)H-RGD2-PTX had higher initial tumor exposure dose and prolonged tumor retention than (3)H-PTX. Metronomic low-dose treatment of breast cancer indicated that RGD2-PTX is significantly more effective than PTX+RGD2 combination and solvent control. Although in vivo (18)F-FLT/PET imaging and ex vivo Ki67 staining indicated little effect of the PTX-based drug on cell proliferation, (18)F-FDG/PET imaging showed significantly reduced tumor metabolism in the RGD2-PTX-treated mice versus those treated with RGD2+PTX and solvent control. Terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining also showed that RGD2-PTX treatment also had significantly higher cell apoptosis ratio than the other two groups. Moreover, the microvessel density was significantly reduced after RGD2-PTX treatment as determined by CD31 staining.Our results demonstrate that integrin-targeted delivery of paclitaxel allows preferential cytotoxicity to integrin-expressing tumor cells and tumor vasculature. The targeted delivery strategies developed in this study may also be applied to other chemotherapeutics for selective tumor killing.",

        "abstract": "Early evaluation of cancer response to a therapeutic regimen can help increase the effectiveness of treatment schemes and, by enabling early termination of ineffective treatments, minimize toxicity, and reduce expenses. Biomarkers that provide early indication of tumor therapy response are urgently needed. Solid tumors require blood vessels for growth, and new anti-angiogenic agents can act by preventing the development of a suitable blood supply to sustain tumor growth. The purpose of this study is to develop a class of novel molecular imaging probes that will predict tumor early response to an anti-angiogenic regimen with the humanized vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab. Using a bevacizumab-sensitive LS174T colorectal cancer model and a 12-mer bacteriophage (phage) display peptide library, a bevacizumab-responsive peptide (BRP) was identified after six rounds of biopanning and tested in vitro and in vivo. This 12-mer peptide was metabolically stable and had low toxicity to both endothelial cells and tumor cells. Near-infrared dye IRDye800-labeled BRP phage showed strong binding to bevacizumab-treated tumors, but not to untreated control LS174T tumors. In addition, both IRDye800- and (18)F-labeled BRP peptide had significantly higher uptake in tumors treated with bevacizumab than in controls treated with phosphate-buffered saline. Ex vivo histopathology confirmed the specificity of the BRP peptide to bevacizumab-treated tumor vasculature. In summary, a novel 12-mer peptide BRP selected using phage display techniques allowed non-invasive visualization of early responses to anti-angiogenic treatment. Suitably labeled BRP peptide may be potentially useful pre-clinically and clinically for monitoring treatment response.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) leads to left ventricular (LV) remodeling, which leads to the activation of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the kinetics of a growth factor's receptor expression, such as VEGF, in the living subject has not yet been described. We have developed a PET tracer (64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 [DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazadodecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid]) to image VEGF receptor (VEGFR) expression after MI in the living subject.In Sprague-Dawley rats, MI was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery and confirmed by ultrasound (n = 8). To image and study the kinetics of VEGFRs, 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 PET scans were performed before MI induction (baseline) and on days 3, 10, 17, and 24 after MI. Sham-operated animals served as controls (n = 3).Myocardial origin of the 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 signal was confirmed by CT coregistration and autoradiography. VEGFR specificity of the 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 probe was confirmed by in vivo use of a 64Cu-DOTA-VEGFmutant. Baseline myocardial uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 was minimal (0.30 +/- 0.07 %ID/g [percentage injected dose per gram of tissue]); it increased significantly after MI (day 3, 0.97 +/- 0.05 %ID/g; P < 0.05 vs. baseline) and remained elevated for 2 wk (up to day 17 after MI), after which time it returned to baseline levels.We demonstrate the feasibility of imaging VEGFRs in the myocardium. In summary, we imaged and described the kinetics of 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121 uptake in a rat model of MI. Studies such as the one presented here will likely play a major role when studying pathophysiology and assessing therapies in different animal models of disease and, potentially, in patients.",

Imaging VEGFR expression can serve as a new paradigm for assessing the efficacy of antiangiogenic cancer therapy, improving cancer management, and elucidating the role and modulation of VEGF/VEGFR signaling during cancer development and intervention. In this study we developed an Avi-tagged VEGF(121) protein, which is site-specifically biotinylated in the presence of bacterial BirA biotin ligase. BirA biotinylated VEGF(121)-Avi (VEGF(121)-Avib) forms a stable complex with streptavidin-IRDye800 (SA800) that retains high affinity for VEGFR in vitro and allows receptor specific targeting in vivo in a 67NR murine xenograft model. In contrast, chemical coupling of IRDye800 abrogated the VEGFR binding ability of the modified protein both in vitro and in vivo. The VEGF(121)-Avib/SA800 complex (VEGF-Avib/SA800) may be used for quantitative and repetitive near-infrared fluorescence imaging of VEGFR expression and translated into clinic for evaluating cancer and other angiogenesis related diseases.",

        "title": "microPET of Tumor Integrin a v b 3 Expression Using 18 F-Labeled PEGylated Tetrameric RGD Peptide ( 18 F-FPRGD4)",
        "abstract": "In vivo imaging of avb3 expression has important diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Multimeric cyclic RGD peptides are capable of improving the integrin avb3-binding affinity due to the polyvalency effect. Here we report an example of 18 F-labeled tetrameric RGD peptide for PET of avb3 expression in both xeno- graft and spontaneous tumor models. Methods: The tetra- meric RGD peptide EfE(c(RGDyK))2g2 was derived with amino- 3,6,9-trioxaundecanoic acid (mini-PEG; PEG is poly(ethylene glycol)) linker through the glutamate a-amino group. NH2-mini- PEG-EfE(c(RGDyK))2g2 (PRGD4) was labeled with 18 F via the N-succinimidyl-4- 18 F-fluorobenzoate ( 18 F-SFB) prosthetic group. The receptor-binding characteristics of the tetrameric RGD pep- tide tracer 18 F-FPRGD4 were evaluated in vitro by a cell-binding assay and in vivo by quantitative microPET imaging studies. Results: The decay-corrected radiochemical yield for 18 F- FPRGD4 was about 15%, with a total reaction time of 180 min starting from 18 F-F 2 . The PEGylation had minimal effect on integ- rin-binding affinity of the RGD peptide. 18F-FPRGD4 has signifi- cantly higher tumor uptake compared with monomeric and dimeric RGD peptide tracer analogs. The receptor specificity of 18 F-FPRGD4 in vivo was confirmed by effective blocking of the uptake in both tumors and normal organs or tissues with excess c(RGDyK). Conclusion: The tetrameric RGD peptide tracer 18 F- FPRGD4 possessing high integrin-binding affinity and favorable biokinetics is a promising tracer for PET of integrin avb3 expres- sion in cancer and other angiogenesis related diseases.",

        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and its receptors, Flt-1/FLT-1 (VEGFR-1) and Flk-1/KDR (VEGFR-2), are key regulators of tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. The purpose of this study was to determine the antiangiogenic and antitumor efficacies of a vasculature-targeting fusion toxin (VEGF(121)/rGel) composed of the VEGF-A isoform VEGF(121) linked with a G(4)S tether to recombinant plant toxin gelonin (rGel) in an orthotopic glioblastoma mouse model by use of noninvasive in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI), MRI, and PET.Tumor-bearing mice were randomized into 2 groups and balanced according to BLI and MRI signals. PET with (64)Cu-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododedane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-VEGF(121)/rGel was performed before VEGF(121)/rGel treatment. (18)F-Fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) scans were obtained before and after treatment to evaluate VEGF(121)/rGel therapeutic efficacy. In vivo results were confirmed with ex vivo histologic and immunohistochemical analyses.Logarithmic transformation of peak BLI tumor signal intensity revealed a strong correlation with MRI tumor volume (r = 0.89, n = 14). PET with (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121)/rGel before treatment revealed a tumor accumulation (mean +/- SD) of 11.8 +/- 2.3 percentage injected dose per gram at 18 h after injection, and the receptor specificity of the tumor accumulation was confirmed by successful blocking of the uptake in the presence of an excess amount of VEGF(121). PET with (18)F-FLT revealed significant a decrease in tumor proliferation in VEGF(121)/rGel-treated mice compared with control mice. Histologic analysis revealed specific tumor neovasculature damage after treatment with 4 doses of VEGF(121)/rGel; this damage was accompanied by a significant decrease in peak BLI tumor signal intensity.The results of this study suggest that future clinical multimodality imaging and therapy with VEGF(121)/rGel may provide an effective means to prospectively identify patients who will benefit from VEGF(121)/rGel therapy and then stratify, personalize, and monitor treatment to obtain optimal survival outcomes.",

However, the limited expression of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) and integrin alpha(v)beta(3) as well as unfavorable in vivo kinetics limited further applications of these imaging agents. We hypothesize that a peptide ligand recognizing both GRPR and integrin will be advantageous because of its dual-receptor-targeting ability.A BBN-RGD heterodimer was synthesized from bombesin(7-14) and c(RGDyK) through a glutamate linker and then labeled with (18)F via the N-succinimidyl-4-(18)F-fluorobenzoate ((18)F-SFB) prosthetic group. The receptor-binding characteristics and tumor-targeting efficacy of (18)F-FB-BBN-RGD were tested in vitro and in vivo.FB-BBN-RGD had comparable integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-binding affinity with c(RGDyK) and comparable GRPR-binding affinity with BBN(7-14). (18)F-FB-BBN-RGD had significantly higher tumor uptake compared with monomeric RGD and monomeric BBN peptide tracer analogs at all time points examined. The PC-3 tumor uptake of (18)F-FB-BBN-RGD was inhibited only partially in the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled BBN(7-14) or c(RGDyK) but was blocked completely in the presence of both BBN(7-14) and c(RGDyK). Compared with (18)F-FB-BBN and (18)F-FB-RGD, (18)F-FB-BBN-RGD also had improved pharmacokinetics, resulting in a significantly higher imaging quality.Dual integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and GRPR recognition showed significantly improved tumor-targeting efficacy and pharmacokinetics compared with (18)F-labeled RGD and BBN analogs.

        "abstract": "In this study, we evaluated the 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced acute and chronic inflammation in living mice by PET imaging of TNF-alpha and integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression.TPA was topically applied to the right ear of BALB/c mice every other day to create the inflammation model. (64)Cu-DOTA-etanercept and (64)Cu-DOTA-E{E[c(RGDyK)](2)}(2) were used for PET imaging of TNF-alpha and integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression in both acute and chronic inflammation. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, ex vivo autoradiography, direct tissue sampling, and immunofluorescence staining were also performed to confirm the non-invasive PET imaging results.The ear thickness increased significantly and the TNF-alpha level more than tripled after a single TPA challenge. MicroPET imaging using (64)Cu-DOTA-etanercept revealed high activity accumulation in the inflamed ear, reaching 11.1 +/- 1.3, 13.0 +/- 2.0, 10.9 +/- 1.4, 10.2 +/- 2.2%ID/g at 1, 4, 16, and 24 h post injection, respectively (n = 3). Repeated TPA challenges caused TPA-specific chronic inflammation and reduced (64)Cu-DOTA-etanercept uptake due to lowered TNF-alpha expression. (64)Cu-DOTA-E{E[c(RGDyK)](2)}(2) uptake in the chronically inflamed ears (after four and eight TPA challenges) was significantly higher than in the control ears and those after one TPA challenge. Immunofluorescence staining revealed increased integrin beta(3) expression, consistent with the non-invasive PET imaging results using (64)Cu-DOTA-E{E[c(RGDyK)](2)}(2) as an integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-specific radiotracer. Biodistribution and autoradiography studies further confirmed the quantification capability of microPET imaging.Successful PET imaging of TNF-alpha expression in acute inflammation and integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression in chronic inflammation provides the rationale for multiple target evaluation over time to fully understand the inflammation processes.",

        "abstract": "As a result of therapy-induced apoptosis, peripheral blood monocytes are recruited to tumors, where they become tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). To date, few studies have investigated noninvasive molecular imaging for assessment of macrophage infiltration in response to therapy-induced apoptosis. Here, noninvasive assessment of changes in tumor accumulation of TAMs was proposed as a new way to measure early tumor response to anticancer therapy. Three different nanoparticles, QD710-Dendron quantum dots (QD710-D), Ferumoxytol, and PG-Gd-NIR813, were used for near-infrared fluorescence imaging, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and dual optical/T1-weighted MR imaging, respectively, in the MDA-MB-435 tumor model. Treatment with Abraxane induced tumor apoptosis and infiltrating macrophages. In spite of markedly different physicochemical properties among the nanoparticles, in vivo imaging revealed increased uptake of all three nanoparticles in Abraxane-treated tumors compared with untreated tumors. Moreover, imaging visualized increased uptake of QD710-D in MDA-MB-435 tumors but not in drug-resistant MDA-MB-435R tumors grown in the mice treated with Abraxane. Our results suggest that infiltration of macrophages due to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was partially responsible for increased nanoparticle uptake in treated tumors. Noninvasive imaging techniques in conjunction with systemic administration of imageable nanoparticles that are taken up by macrophages are a potentially useful tool for assessing early treatment response.",

        "abstract": "A peptide heterodimer comprises two different receptor-targeting peptide ligands. Molecular imaging probes based on dual-receptor targeting peptide heterodimers exhibit improved tumor targeting efficacy for multi-receptor expressing tumors compared with their parent single-receptor targeting peptide monomers. Previously we have developed bombesin (BBN)-RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide heterodimers, in which BBN and RGD are covalently connected with an asymmetric glutamate linker (J Med Chem 52:425-432, 2009). Although (18)F-labeled heterodimers showed significantly better microPET imaging quality than (18)F-labeled RGD and BBN monomers in a PC-3 xenograft model which co-expresses gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, tedious heterodimer synthesis due to the asymmetric nature of glutamate linker restricts their clinical applications. In this study, we report the use of a symmetric linker AEADP [AEADP = 3,3'-(2-aminoethylazanediyl)dipropanoic acid] for the synthesis of BBN-RGD peptide heterodimer. The (18)F-labeled heterodimer ((18)F-FB-AEADP-BBN-RGD) showed comparable microPET imaging results with glutamate linked BBN-RGD heterodimers, indicating that the replacement of glutamate linker with AEADP linker did not affect the biological activities of BBN-RGD heterodimer. The heterodimer synthesis is rather easy and straightforward. Because tumors often co-express multiple receptors, the use of a symmetric linker provides a general method of fast assembly of various peptide heterodimers for imaging multi-receptor expressing tumors.",

On the basis of its high delta selectivity, H-Dmt-Tic--Lys(Z)-OH (reference compound 1) is a useful starting point for the synthesis of (18)F-labeled compounds prepared by the coupling of N-succinimidyl 4-[ (18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) with Boc-Dmt-Tic--Lys(Z)-OH under slightly basic conditions at 37 degrees C for 15 min, deprotection with TFA, and HPLC purification. The total synthesis time was 120 min, and the decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [(18)F]- 1 was about 25-30% ( n = 5) starting from [(18)F]SFB ( n = 5) with an effective specific activity about 46 GBq/micromol. In vitro autoradiography studies showed prominent uptake of [ (18)F]- 1 in the striatum and cortex with significant blocking by 1 and UFP-501 (selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist), suggesting high specific binding of [(18)F]- 1 to delta-opioid receptors. Noninvasive microPET imaging studies revealed the absence of [(18)F]- 1 in rat brain, since it fails to cross the blood-brain barrier. This study demonstrates the suitability of [ (18)F]- 1 for imaging peripheral delta-opioid receptors.",

Abnormal expression of AATs is often associated with cancer, addiction, and multiple mental diseases. Although methods to evaluate in vivo expression of AATs would be highly useful, efforts to develop them have been hampered by a lack of appropriate tracers. We describe a new class of AA mimics-boramino acids (BAAs)-that can serve as general imaging probes for AATs. The structure of a BAA is identical to that of the corresponding natural AA, except for an exotic replacement of the carboxylate with -BF3 (-). Cellular studies demonstrate strong AAT-mediated cell uptake, and animal studies show high tumor-specific accumulation, suggesting that BAAs hold great promise for the development of new imaging probes and smart AAT-targeting drugs.",

The tumor imaging ability of (64)Cu-PTSM and (64)Cu-PEI was investigated in U87MG human glioblastoma xenograft model. (64)Cu-PEI-polyethylene glycol (PEG) was also synthesized, and the cell uptake, efflux, cytotoxicity, and the biodistribution were carried out and compared with (64)Cu-PEI.Both (64)Cu-PEI and (64)Cu-PEI-PEG were obtained in high labeling yield without the need of macrocyclic chelating agents. (64)Cu-PEI showed lower cell labeling efficiency than (64)Cu-PTSM. Small-animal PET images of living mice indicate that tail-vein-injected U87MG cells labeled with (64)Cu-PTSM or (64)Cu-PEI traffic to the lungs and liver. In a subcutaneous U87MG xenograft model, (64)Cu-PEI had higher tumor uptake (18.7 +/- 2.2 %ID/g at 24 h) than (64)Cu-PTSM (12.4 +/- 1.7 %ID/g at 24 h). In comparison with (64)Cu-PEI, (64)Cu-PEI-PEG had decreased toxicity and increased cell uptake in cell culture, as well as higher tumor uptake and better tumor-to-background contrast in U87MG xenograft model.(64)Cu-labeled polyethylenimine can be used for both cell trafficking and tumor imaging. PEGylation reduces the toxicity of (64)Cu-PEI and improves the tumor imaging ability.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Abegrin is a monoclonal antibody to human integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, a cell adhesion molecule highly expressed on actively angiogenic endothelium and glioblastoma multiforme tumor cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel 90Y-Abegrin radioimmunotherapeutic agent in murine xenograft glioblastoma models with noninvasive in vivo molecular imaging modalities. Experimental Design: A s.c. U87MG human glioblastoma xenograft model was used to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), biodistribution, dose response, and efficacy of 90Y-Abegrin. An titumor efficacy was also characterized in an orthotopic U87MG and in a HT-29 colorectal cancer model, a low integrin-expressing carcinoma. Small-animal positron emission tomography imaging was used to correlate histologic findings of treatment efficacy. Results: MTD and dose response analysis revealed 200 \u03bcCi per mouse as appropriate treatment dose with hepatic clearance and no organ toxicity. 90Y-Abegrin-treated U87MG tumor mice showed partial regression of tumor volume, with increased tumor volumes in 90Y-IgG, Abegrin, and saline groups. 18F-FDG imaging revealed a reduction of cell proliferation and metabolic activity whereas 18F-FLT reflected decreased DNA synthesis in the 90Y-Abegrin group. Ki67 analysis showed reduced proliferative index and quantitative terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive analysis revealed increased DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in 90Y-Abegrin animals. CD31 and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining showed increased vascular fragmentation and dysmorphic vessel structure in 90Y-Abegrin animals only. Orthotopic U87MG tumors treated with 90Y-Abegrin displayed reduced tumor volume. HT-29 tumors showed no significant difference among the various groups. Conclusion: Radioimmunotherapy with 90Y-labeled Abegrin may prove promising in the treatment of highly vascular, invasive, and heterogeneous malignant brain tumors. \u00a92008 American Association for Cancer Research.",

This new method was exemplified in the synthesis of 64Cu-labeled RGD peptide for PET imaging of tumor integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression in vivo. The catalyst-free click chemistry reaction proceeded with a fast rate and eliminated the contamination problem of the catalyst Cu(I) ions interfering with the 64Cu radiolabeling procedure under the conventional Cu-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition condition. The new strategy is simple and robust, and the resultant 64Cu-labeled RGD probe was obtained in an excellent yield and high specific activity. PET imaging and biodistribution studies revealed significant, specific uptake of the \"click\" 64Cu-labeled RGD probe in integrin \u03b1v\u03b2 3-positive U87MG xenografts with little uptake in nontarget tissues. This new approach is versatile, which warrants a wide range of applications for highly diverse radiometalated bioconjugates for radioimaging and radiotherapy. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "CD13 receptor as a tumor vasculature biomarker has attracted great attention in cancer research. Through phage display screening, NGR-containing peptides have been characterized as specific ligands binding to CD13 receptor. In this study, a (64)Cu-labeled dimeric NGR peptide based on sarcophagine cage was synthesized and evaluated for micropositron emission tomography (PET) imaging of CD13 expression in vivo. Macrocyclic chelating agent (sarcophagine cage) was conjugated with two azide moieties, followed by mixing with an alkyne-containing NGR peptide to rapidly provide the Sar-NGR2 peptide by click chemistry. Radiolabeling of Sar-NGR2 with (64)Cu was achieved in >90% decay-corrected yield with radiochemical purity of >99%. The cell uptake study showed that (64)Cu-Sar-NGR2 binds to CD13-positive HT-1080 cells, but not to CD13-negative MCF-7 cells. MicroPET imaging results revealed that (64)Cu-Sar-NGR2 exhibits good tumor uptake in CD13-positive HT-1080 xenografts and significantly lower tumor uptake in CD13-negative MCF-7 xenografts. The CD13-specific binding of (64)Cu-Sar-NGR2 was further verified by significant reduction of tumor uptake in HT-1080 tumor xenografts with coinjection of a nonradiolabeled NGR peptide. The biodistribution results demonstrated good tumor/muscle ratio (8.28 \u00b1 0.37) of (64)Cu-Sar-NGR2 at 24 h pi in HT-1080 tumor xenografts, which is in agreement with the quantitative analysis of microPET imaging. In conclusion, sarcophagine cage has been successfully applied to the construction of a (64)Cu-labeled dimeric NGR-containing peptide. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that (64)Cu-Sar-NGR2 is a promising PET probe for imaging CD13 expression in living mice.",

        "abstract": "We and others have reported that 18F- and 64Cu-labeled arginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartate (RGD) peptides allow positron emission tomography (PET) quantification of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression in vivo. However, clinical translation of these radiotracers is partially hindered by the necessity of cyclotron facility to produce the PET isotopes. Generator-based PET isotope 68Ga, with a half-life of 68\u00a0min and 89% positron emission, deserves special attention because of its independence of an onsite cyclotron. The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of 68Ga-labeled RGD peptides for tumor imaging.",

        "abstract": "It is widely accepted that disassembly of the North China ancient craton and the thinning process of lithosphere at depth are essential for the dynamic evolution model of the China mainland since Mesozoic and Cenozoic times. To address these issues, the deep structure of the lithosphere beneath North China should be well delineated, which relies on a new generation of geophysical technology including ultra-broadband high-precision magnetotelluric (MT) sounding. In 2001 and 2005, MT survey was carried out along the Yingxian\u2013Shanghe (HB-MT01) and Wenshui\u2013Rizhao (HB-MT02) profiles in eastern North China, respectively. The results show that the crust and upper mantle along the profiles can be divided into four electric sections, and high-conductivity zones and high-conductivity layers exist in the lower crust and upper mantle, respectively. It is inferred that decoupling between crust and mantle is present beneath eastern North China which is associated with large-scale tectonic movements. The thickness of the lithosphere in eastern North China is estimated to be 50\u201380 km, which has apparently thinned with respect to usual continental cratonic regions. It involves the northern Taihangshan uplift, northern North China rifted basin and Luxi (western Shandong) fault-bounded uplift, which is different from the previous claim that the lithospheric thinning is confined to east of the Taihangshan gravity gradient zone. This study also demonstrates the importance of the modern high-precision MT sounding and combination of geophysics, geology, and geochemistry in the research of continental dynamics.",

Both the overseas literatures and the domestic applications indicate that when the detecting device is working on the seafloor, losing the data occasionally happens because of various unexpected factors. Compared with continental operation, there are higher risk and expenses in detecting and more difficult in acquisition repeatedly on the marine magnetotellurics. Therefore, it is of great scientific significance to study the technique prospecting doubly and simultaneously so as to extract the whole medium electric information in exploration areas and ensure the integrality of the real acquisition data. The project chooses the PC104 computer as microcontroller and also comprises of the interface circuit, which converts the PC104 bus to the USB bus and saves the real time data acquired on the marine magnetotellurics into the IDE disk and U disk simultaneously. The chips adopted by the circuit include CPLD in encoding and logic controlling, bidirectional data received and transmitted and CH375A of interface conversion, and the source program of PC104 also contains their corresponding instructions. With that function, it has insured the full preservation of the acquisition because of redundant data. The practicality has been approved by Huanghai Sea experimentation.",

        "abstract": "Magnetotelluric (MT) sounding is an important geophysical method to probe crust and upper mantle structure. The long-period MT instrument is essential during the project \"Deep Exploration Technology and Experimentation (SinoProbe)\" in China. However, China cannot produce the long-period MT instrument by itself now and only relies on LEMI-417 imported from Ukraine. When using this instrument, we find the resolution of telluric field meter is 0.01 mV/km and the resolution of magnetometer is 0.01 nT through its data file Final.asc, which shows its accuracy is low compared with other MT instruments. And the LEMI-417 did not work normally without GPS signal when data acquisition using LEMI-417 was conducted by our group team. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a set of long-period MT instrument which meets the need of our project. As MT signals, include telluric field signal and magneto signal, are weak and easy to be embedded in noise, they need to be amplified. Thus, the amplifier CS3301 with low noise and least distortion of harmonic waves is selected. The CS3301 provides four input choices and seven gain selections, which are made through using the MUX and GAIN pins. After analysis and testing, CS3301 is set under Gain\u00d764 and input mode 2 in the telluric field signal acquisition circuit. In this case, if the polar distance exceeds 100 meter, the resolution of telluric field meter is 0.001 mV/km. It is set under Gain\u00d764 and input mode 3 in the magneto signal acquisition circuit, which uses the feedback method to deduct the constant signal and makes the amplifier only amplify variable signals. And in this case, the resolution of magneto meter is 0.006 nT. As comparison tests, the instrument with CS3301 and LEMI-417 were used to collect MT data at several measuring points in the same time, such as measuring point 9005 in south China and measuring point 1600 in northeast China. The results show that their time series curves are consistent and the MT sounding curves after data processing are also consistent, indicative of success of the instrument design.",

The data acquisition of remote reference is used to suppress interference and acquire the high quality data due to the magnetotelluric regional noise. The base station on land and surveying net under the water should follow simultaneous observation and the same location coordinates in the acquisition process. In order to solve the problems above, the high-precision clock, detecting posture device and automatic measurement circuit are equipped in marine magnetotelluric instrument. The instruments are placed point-to-point when the ship carries out marine experiments along scheduled routes. The characteristic of instrument flotage changes by remote control to let it automatic return to offing after the acquisition completes. Recent marine experiments indicate that the seafloor magnetotelluric prospecting in China have achieved utility and can offer high technology support in marine prospecting.",

To design a receiver that performs well and overcomes the abovementioned problems, we performed forward modeling of the E-field abnormal response and established the receiver\u2019s characteristics. We describe the design optimization and the properties of each component, that is, low-noise induction coil sensor, low-noise Ag/AgCl electrode, low-noise chopper amplifier, digital temperature-compensated crystal oscillator module, acoustic telemetry modem, and burn wire system. Finally, we discuss the results of onshore and offshore field tests to show the effectiveness of the developed seafloor electromagnetic receiver and its performance: typical E-field noise of 0.12 nV/m/rt(Hz) at 0.5 Hz, dynamic range higher than 120 dB, clock drift lower than 1 ms/day, and continuous operation of at least 21 days.",

        "abstract": "To test the frequency response of a magnetotelluric (MT) receiver, a broadband source, especially white noise is more efficient and intuitive than single frequency signals. In view of the absence of an appropriate source generator for MT receiver indoor testing, we designed a broadband signal generator based on a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS). Firstly, we divided the whole MT band into two segments to avoid data redundancy and simplify calculation in data processing and designed a generator composed of several modules: a clock module, a PRBS logic module, and a voltage level conversion module. We conducted a detailed analysis of the optimal parameter selection methods for each module, and key parameters including clock frequency, order, the primitive polynomial and the original states of the linear registers were determined. The generator provides four-channel PRBS signals with two effective bandwidths of 5 \u00d7 10\u22124\u2013714 Hz and 0.1 Hz\u201314 kHz which are broad enough to cover the frequency range for different MT methods. These four-channel signals were used to simulate two modes of sources (xy and yx) with strong auto-correlation and weak cross-correlation. The power spectral density is quite stable in the whole passband. The new generator is characterized by broadband output in low-frequency bands, low power consumption, simple operation and reliable performance. Indoor and field tests indicated that the generator can provide an analog MT source and is a practical tool for MT receiver indoor testing.",

These marine EM data are used for offshore gas hydrate and petroleum exploration. Although many conventional receivers are used for offshore data acquisition, they have deficiencies, such as a large size, high cost, and low operational efficiency. To address these limitations, we have developed a micro ocean-bottom E-field (micro-OBE) receiver. It reduces costs and deck-space use, while providing improved horizontal resolution and operational efficiency. Based on conventional receiver specifications, including low noise levels, low power consumption, and low clock-drift error, we reduced the receiver size, provided a low-cost release mechanism, integrated an acoustic telemetry module, improved the operational efficiency, and reduced the field acquisition cost. The resulting micro-OBE is comprised of a compact nylon frame, 17\u00a0inch glass sphere, log...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Spectral induced polarization (SIP) measurement requires synchronous current acquisition and real-timetransmission devices or precise phase-measuring apparatus. To carry out SIP investigations in the absence of these auxiliary devices, a new SIP measurement has been developed in this research. The new method uses high-accuracy phase-calculation technology based on all-phase spectrum analysis (APSA) to obtain the initial phase of the emission current and uses time information recorded in the file header of the voltage data file and the \u2018Frequency-Time Table\u2019 of the emission current to calculate the current phase information at any given moment. The phase-calculation method for the voltage data was the same as that used for the current initial phase. Subsequently, the phase of the complex resistivity was obtained by subtracting the current phase from the voltage phase, and the amplitude was obtained by normalization. Simulation tests showed that the algorithm was superior for absolute phase measurement compared with other spectrum analysis methods and confirmed that the accuracy of the new method was equal to that of the measurement that collects voltage and current synchronously. Indoor and field tests showed that the new APSA-based SIP method can successfully measure the complex resistivity without a synchronous current- or phase-measuring device. Moreover, this method reduces the requirement for synchronization of the transmitter and receiver.",

        "abstract": "Electrical and electromagnetic methods have long played an important role in mineral exploration. For example, in active source prospecting methods, when measuring the values of many electrical parameters, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by increasing the transmitting power. In this paper, we present a multifunction borehole ground electromagnetic transmitting system that transmits rectangular waves at a frequency of 0.01\u201310\u00a0kHz with a frequency error less than 10 \u22128 \u00a0Hz @ 1\u00a0Hz (depending on the high-precision temperature compensation crystal) and the initial synchronization error between the transmitter and receiver is less than   $ pm text{0.1},mu {text{s}}$  . During operation, either the maximum transmitting voltage output can reach 950\u00a0V or the maximum transmitting current can exceed 90\u00a0A, but both cannot be achieved simultaneously. We tested the transmitting system at its maximum power output continuously for over 8 h and the power output was more than 48\u00a0kW at a current above 60 A. The energy was delivered above ground or underground using existing drill casings to produce the high-power transmissions. The field experiments show that the system meets the demands of the controlled-source audio-frequency magnetotelluric and induced polarization methods used in mineral exploration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Qiongdongnan Basin (QB) is an important prospecting area for gas hydrates in the South China Sea (SCS). However, it is difficult to infer gas hydrates using a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) under the influence of flat seabed, multiples and bubble effects. In the QB, the upper limit of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) and the distribution of gas hydrates in the shallow seabed are still not well understood. A marine controlled-source electromagnetic (MCSEM) survey was completed in order to collect electric resistivity information along a 4.5-km profile. Electromagnetic data were acquired and processed at nine sites. The seafloor receiver orientations were evaluated using the orthogonal procrust rotation analysis (OPRA) method. As a result of isotropic, vertical transverse-isotropic (VTI), and triaxial anisotropic inversion of electric field Pmax data, a 2-D resistivity image of the seabed was presented. Preliminary results show that the shallow seabed can be divided into four electric layers. According to thermodynamic conditions in the QB, the estimated thickness of GHSZ is approximately 320\u202fm for biogenic methane and 272\u202fm for thermogenic gas in the study area. The BSR and hydrates were interpreted by integrating the resistivity model along with thermodynamic calculation and seismic reflection data. The MCSEM result indicates there are abundant natural gas originating or partly originating from a microbial source beneath the GHSZ.",

        "abstract": "Polar codes under cyclic redundancy check-aided successive cancellation list (CA-SCL) decoding can outperform the turbo codes and the LDPC codes when code lengths are configured to be several kilobits. In order to reduce the decoding complexity, a novel tree-pruning scheme for the SCL/CA-SCL decoding algorithms is proposed in this letter. In each step of the decoding procedure, the candidate paths with metrics less than a threshold are dropped directly to avoid the unnecessary computations for the path searching on the descendant branches of them. Given a candidate path, an upper bound of the path metric of its descendants is proposed to determined how much pruning this candidate path would affect frame error rate (FER) performance. By utilizing this upper bounding technique and introducing a dynamic threshold, the proposed scheme deletes as many as possible of the redundant candidate paths while keeping the performance deterioration in a tolerant region, thus it is much more efficient than the existing pruning scheme. With only a negligible loss of FER performance, the computational complexity of the proposed pruned decoding scheme is only about 40% of the standard algorithm in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region (where the FER under CA-SCL decoding is about 0.1 ~ 0.001), and it can be very close to that of the successive cancellation (SC) decoder in the moderate- and high-SNR regions.",

The mechanics of injection process is investigated. A theoretical model is established to evaluate the injection pressure under system conditions (nozzle diameter, ampoule dimension, voice-coil discharging voltage, etc.). An experimental system is set up to measure the injection pressure dynamically. The experimental results agree well with the predicted values given by the theoretical model. In-vitro injections using the current needle-free system are carried out with needle injection as control. Results show that the current magnetic force injection technology can generate enough injection pressure to pierce into skin, and the administration is absorbed in vivo faster than that through needle. The current system features simple structure, two-way operation, and controllable driving force, thus overcoming the disadvantages of traditional needle-free injection systems, and laying the foundation for the product development of novel needle-free injection system. \u00a9 2011 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

        "abstract": "The three-dimensional solid models of butterfly-shaped cervical spine plates were imported into ANSYS software for FEM analysis. According to the anti-fatigue test requirements, the mechanical model was simplified as a pair of compressive load or a bending moment load model for stress cloud calculation. Static FEM analysis was performed for four different types of butterfly-shaped cervical plates, subjected to compressive loads and bending moments respectively. The dangerous nodes with maximum stress were obtained after calculation. Based on the mathematical formula of the S-N curve and Goodman curve, the fatigue life (N) was obtained. It turned out that the stress and strain at the edge of center slot and screw holes are larger than those of the surroundings, and are vulnerable to fatigue fracture. Among four plate types, the fatigue life of three-orifice plate is the largest, and the six-orifice plate the minimum under the same loads.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to understand the acoustic properties of human vertebral cancellous bone and to study the feasibility of ultrasound-based navigation for posterior pedicle screw fixation in spinal fusion surgery. Fourteen human vertebral specimens were disarticulated from seven un-embalmed cadavers (four males, three females, 73.14 \u00b1 9.87 years, two specimens from each cadaver). Seven specimens were used to measure the transmission, including tests of attenuation and phase velocity, while the other seven specimens were used for backscattered measurements to inspect the depth of penetration and A-Mode signals. Five pairs of unfocused broadband ultrasonic transducers were used for the detection, with center frequencies of 0.5 MHz, 1 MHz, 1.5 MHz, 2.25 MHz, and 3.5 MHz. As a result, good and stable results were documented. With increased frequency, the attenuation increased (P<0.05), stability of the speed of sound improved (P<0.05), and penetration distance decreased (P>0.05). At about 0.6 cm away from the cortical bone, warning signals were easily observed from the backscattered measurements. In conclusion, the ultrasonic system proved to be an effective, moveable, and real-time imaging navigation system. However, how ultrasonic navigation will benefit pedicle screw insertion in spinal surgery needs to be determined. Therefore, ultrasound-guided pedicle screw implantation is theoretically effective and promising.",

However, there is no culturally adapted SSS Questionnaire for use in mainland China.This was a prospective clinical validation study. The adaption was conducted according to International Quality of Life Assessment Project guidelines. To examine the psychometric properties of the adapted SC-SSS Questionnaire, a sample of 105 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis were included. Thirty-two patients were randomly selected to evaluate the test-retest reliability. Reliability assessment of the SC-SSS Questionnaire was determined by calculating Cronbach \u03b1 and intraclass coefficient values. Concurrent validity was assessed by correlating SC-SSS Questionnaire scores with relevant domains of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey.Cronbach \u03b1 of the symptom severity scale, physical function scale, patients, and satisfaction scale of SC-SSS Questionnaire are 0.89, 0.86, 0.91, respectively, which revealed very good internal consistency. The test-retest reproducibility was found to be excellent with the intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93, 0.91, and 0.95. In terms of concurrent validity, SC-SSS Questionnaire had good correlation with physical functioning and bodily pain of 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (r = 0.663, 0.653) and low correlation with mental health (r = 0.289). The physical function scale had good correlation with physical functioning of 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (r = 0.637), whereas the rest had moderate correlation. The satisfaction scale score was highly correlated with the change in the symptom severity (r = 0.71) and physical function (r = 0.68) scale score.The SC-SSS Questionnaire showed satisfactory reliability and validity in the evaluation of functionality in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis who are experiencing neurogenic claudication. It is simple and easy to use and can be recommended in clinical and research practice in mainland China.3.",

In order to explore the influence of genetic factors on the mechanism of osteosarcoma by analyzing the inter relationship between osteosarcoma and its related genes, and then provide potential genetic references for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of osteosarcoma, we collected osteosarcoma related gene sequences in Genebank of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and local alignment analysis for a pair of sequences was carried out to identify the measurement association among related sequences. Then fuzzy clustering method was used for clustering analysis so as to contact the unknown genes through the consistent osteosarcoma related genes in one class. From the result of fuzzy clustering analysis, we could classify the osteosarcoma related genes into two groups and deduced that the genes clustered into one group had similar function. Based on this knowledge, we found more genes related to the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma and these genes could exert similar function as Runx2, a risk factor confirmed in osteosarcoma, this study may help better understand the genetic mechanism and provide new molecular markers and therapies for osteosarcoma.",

        "abstract": "Osteosarcoma, which is the most common type of highly malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents, has poor diagnosis and 2-year survival rates of 15-20% following surgery or radiotherapy, and has therefore generated marked attention. In order to investigate the potential biomarkers for diagnosing osteosarcoma, the expression profiling data from normal and disease tissues were compared, respectively, and the differentially\u2011expressed genes were analyzed by three different statistical tests. Interacting proteins were determined and an interaction network was constructed by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database. Subsequently, the protein interaction network was decomposed and Gene Otology annotation using Cytoscape, Mcode and Bingo, was conducted on the function modules. Finally, three differentially\u2011expressed genes GJA1, COL1A2 and COL5A2 were identified, and an interaction network was successfully generated with COL1A2 and COL5A2 at the core. From the results, it was observed that COL1A2 and COL5A2 interact with a number of genes of the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family, including MMP1, MMP2, MMP3 and MMP14, TGF\u03b2 and RUNX2. Furthermore, these genes have been confirmed to be important in the tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma. It was hypothesized that the upregulation of the COL gene family may be considered as a diagnostic marker for osteosarcoma and collagen may be administered as a therapy.",

Firstly, the traditional attitude matching algorithm attitude angle matching algorithm (AAMA) and the improved algorithm attitude matrix matching algorithm (AMMA) are introduced. Then, the measurement misalignment is introduced, which is the product of the attitude matrixes of the master inertial navigation system (INS) and the slave INS, then the measurement misalignment matching algorithm (MMMA) is derived. The above three attitude matching algorithms are derived on the condition that the mount angles of the slave INS are small. Finally, the MMMA is improved which is more suitable when the multiple ejector racks are used to carry more weapons, and the improved MMMA is called OAMA. The relationships among four kinds of algorithms are proved in theory. The velocity plus attitude matching method is used in the simulation study of transfer alignment, and the results show that the four proposed algorithms have the same precisions when the input condition is same, and that the OAMA can be used in the condition when the mount angles of the slave INS are larger angles, which is more suitable for modern wars.",

        "abstract": "Aim. Ref. 3 authored by Kain et al presented an attitude match measurement equation (AMME) without derivation} it is much simpler than traditional ones. We utilize Ref. 3's AMME after derivation. The insight gained through such derivation allows us to propose an algorithm that is different from that of Ref. 3. It is better than Ref. 3's algorithm in that it is not limited to rapid transfer alignment. It is better than traditional algorithms because it is much simpler and the computation load is much less. In the full paper, we explain our algorithm in some detail. In this abstract, we just add some pertinent remarks to listing the two topics of explanation. The first topic is:the modeling of AMME. In this topic, we utilize after deriving the relationship given by Kain et al in Ref. 3 among the platform misalignment, measurement misalignment and physical misalignment as shown in Fig. 1 of the full paper. The second topic is: simulation and analysis. In this topic, we simulate traditional attitude measurement equation, traditional attitude matrix measurement equation and our AMME using the method of both velocity match and attitude match. The simulation results given in Table 1 and Fig. 2 show preliminarily that under the same simulation conditions, all the three measurement equations (two traditional ones and ours) are equally precise in estimating transfer alignment errors, the precision being less than 1 arc second. The simulation results also show that our AMME obtains measurement matrices through utilizing the attitude matrix of the slave SINS, thus reducing computation load.",

        "abstract": "A square-root version of the divided difference Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother is proposed in this paper. The square-root variant essentially propagates the square roots of the covariance matrices and can consistently improve the numerical stability because all the resulting covariance matrices are guaranteed to stay positive semi-definite. Furthermore, the square-root form ensures reliable implementation in an embedded system with fixed or limited precision although it is algebraically equivalent to the standard form. The new smoothing algorithm is tested in a challenging two-dimensional maneuvering target tracking problem with unknown and time-varying turn rate, and its performance is compared with that of other de-facto standard filters and smoothers. The simulation results indicate that the proposed RTS smoother markedly outperforms the associated filters and gives slightly smaller error than an unscented-based RTS smoother.",

The principle of centroid countermeasure of IR decoy was analyzed based on studying the characteristics of movement and IR radiation of self-defence plane , IR decoy and IR guidance missile. Control parameters model of aerial -launched set was built, including start and stop time of aerial -launched set, spacing of sequence aerial -launched decoy and dispensing number.

Meanwhile, the significant maintenance fee to support such monitoring infrastructures motivates us to think about a cost-effective way to manage these systems. In this study, the authors measure, model and evaluate the border gateway protocol (BGP) monitoring system (BGPMon) that is mainly composed of vantage point ASes (i.e. monitors or VPs) peered with Routeviews and RIPE. The results from the authors' experiments show the feasibility to use fewer VPs while still retaining the original monitoring capability of the existing BGPMon. Only 110 VPs out of the original 438 ones are capable of monitoring most of the information for all the six metrics with the optimum VP selection method given in this paper. The authors further evaluate the selected VPs at different times and observe that the performance is encouragingly stable, for example, more than 99% of the information for five out of the six metrics can be constantly captured with less than 110 VPs in random samples. \u00a9 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",

        "abstract": "Our measurements on production data center traffic together with recently reported results suggest that data center networks suffer from long-lived congestion caused by core network over subscription and unbalanced workload placement. In contrast to traditional traffic engineering approaches that optimize flow routing, in this paper, we explore the opportunity to address the continuous congestion via optimizing VM placement in virtualized data centers. To this end, we present Virtual Knotter, an efficient online VM placement algorithm to reduce congestion with controllable VM migration traffic as well as low time complexity. Our evaluation with both real and synthetic traffic patterns shows that Virtual Knotter performs close to the baseline algorithm in terms of link unitization, with only 5%-10% migration traffic of the baseline algorithm. Furthermore, Virtual Knotter decreases link congestion time by 53% for the production data center traffic.",

        "abstract": "As the Internet becomes a critical infrastructure component of our global information-based society, any interruption to its availability can have significant economical and societal impacts. Although many researches tried to improve the resilience through the BGP policy-compliant paths, it has been demonstrated that the Internet is still highly vulnerable when major failures happen. In this paper, we aim to overcome the inherent constraint of the existing BGP-compliant recovery schemes and propose to seek additional potential routing diversity by relaxing BGP peering links and through Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). The focus of this paper is to evaluate the potentiality of these two schemes, rather than on their implementations. By collecting most complete AS link map up-to-date with 31K nodes and 142K links, we demonstrate that the proposed potential routing diversity can recover 40% to 80% of the disconnected paths on average beyond BGP-compliant paths. This work suggests a promising venue to address the Internet failures.",

As a result, recent efforts have advocated oversubscribed networks with the capability to adapt to traffic requirements on-demand. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of OSA, a novel Optical Switching Architecture for DCNs. Leveraging runtime reconfigurable optical devices, OSA dynamically changes its topology and link capacities, thereby achieving unprecedented flexibility to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns. Extensive analytical simulations using both real and synthetic traffic patterns demonstrate that OSA can deliver high bisection bandwidth (60%-100% of the nonblocking architecture). Implementation and evaluation of a small-scale functional prototype further demonstrate the feasibility of OSA.",

        "abstract": "Address auto-configuration is a key problem in data center networks, where servers and switches encode topology information into their addresses for routing. A recent work DAC [2] has been introduced to address this problem. Without malfunctions, DAC can auto-configure all the devices quickly. But in case of malfunctions, DAC requires significant human efforts to correct malfunctions and it can cause substantial operation delay of the whole data center. In this paper, we further optimize address auto-configuration process even in the presence of malfunctions. Instead of waiting for all the malfunctions to be corrected, we could first configure the devices that are not involved in malfunctions and let them work first. This idea can be translated to considerable practical benefits because in most cases malfunctions in data centers only account for a very small portion. To realize the idea, we conceptually remove the malfunctions from the physical data center topology graph and mathematically convert the address configuration problem into induced sub graph isomorphism problem, which is NP-complete. We then introduce an algorithm that can solve the induced sub graph isomorphism quickly by taking advantage of data center topology characteristics and induced sub graph properties. We extensively evaluate our design on representative data center structures with various malfunction scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework and algorithm are efficient and labor-free to deal with the mapping task in the presence of error devices.",

        "abstract": "A basic task in network passive measurement is collecting flow statistics information for network state characterization. With the continuous increase of Internet link speed and the number of flows, flow statistics has become a great challenge due to the demanding requirements on both memory size and memory bandwidth in measurement devices. In this paper, we propose a DIScount COunting (DISCO) method, which is designed for both flow size and flow volume counting. For each incoming packet of length l, DISCO increases the corresponding counter assigned to the flow with an increment that is less than l. With an elaborate design on the counter update rule and the inverse estimation, DISCO saves memory consumption while providing an accurate unbiased estimator. The method is evaluated thoroughly under theoretical analysis and simulations with synthetic and real traces. The results demonstrate that DISCO is more accurate than related work given the same counter size. DISCO is also implemented on network processor Intel IXP2850 for performance test. Using only one MicroEngine (ME) in IXP2850, the throughput can reach up to 11.1Gbps under a traditional traffic pattern, and it increases almost linearly with the number of MEs employed.",

        "abstract": "The publicly available BGP vantage points (VPs) have been heavily used by the research community to build the Internet autonomous system (AS) level topology, which is a key input to many applications, such as routing protocol design, performance evaluation and network security issues. However, a detailed study on the eyeshots of these VPs has received little attention before. In this paper, we inspect these VPs carefully. Specifically, we do a measurement work to evaluate the effect of various factors on the eyeshot of each individual VP as well as the relationship between the eyeshots of different VPs. Based on the measurements, we disclose several counterintuitive observations and explain the possible reasons behind, which will help people to better understand the eyeshots of VPs and make better use of them in practice.",

        "abstract": "An accurate Internet topology graph is important in many areas of networking, from deciding ISP business relationships to diagnosing network anomalies. Most Internet mapping efforts have derived the network structure, at the level of interconnected autonomous sys- tems (ASes), from a limited number of either BGP- or traceroute- based data sources. While techniques for charting the topology continue to improve, the growth of the number of vantage points is significantly outpaced by the rapid growth of the Internet. In this paper, we argue that a promising approach to revealing the hidden areas of the Internet topology is through active measure- ment from an observation platform that scales with the growing In- ternet. By leveraging measurements performed by an extension to a popular P2P system, we show that this approach indeed exposes significant new topological information. Based on tracerou te mea- surements from more than 992, 000 IPs in over 3, 700 ASes dis- tributed across the Internet hierarchy, our proposed heuri stics iden- tify 23, 914 new AS links not visible in the publicly-available BGP data - 12.86% more customer-provider links and 40.99% more peering links, than previously reported. We validate our heuris- tics using data from a tier-1 ISP and show that they correctly filter out all false links introduced by public IP-to-AS mapping. We have made the identified set of links and their inferred relations hips pub- lically available.",

        "title": "Architecture design and management for data center networks",
        "abstract": "Driven by technology advances and economic forces, data centers are being built around the world to serve as the infrastructures for big data analysis services (e.g., GFS, Map-reduce, and Dryad), Internet-based applications (e.g., web search, e-commerce, and online social networking) and cloud computing services (e.g., Amazon EC2, Microsoft Windows Azure, and Google App Engine). Typically, a data center may contain thousands, tens of thousands or even millions of servers with significant inter-node bandwidth requirement between them. How to design efficient and sustainable data center network architectures, and how to manage/configure the networks are two fundamental challenges for data center networking (DCN) research, which form the basis of this Ph.D. dissertation work. Our research focuses on designing efficient DCN from both the architecture perspective and the management perspective. This dissertation is mainly composed of two key components called OSA and DAC. Specifically, OSA is a novel optical switching architecture for data center networks. At its core, by exploiting runtime reconfigurable optical devices, OSA flexibly adapts its topology and link capacities to various traffic patterns, thus achieving high network bisection bandwidth. The key idea we hope to deliver via OSA is that: a thin but flexible architecture, instead of static fat ones, can better support data center networking in a simple, cost-effective and sustainable way. On the other hand, DAC is a management system that can perform address autoconfiguration for both OSA network and other generic data center networks. DAC is motivated by the key observation that data center networks encode locality and topology information into their server and switch addresses for performance, reliability and routing purposes, making the traditional address autoconfiguration protocols, like DHCP, not applicable in the new data center environment. The core of DAC is to reduce the data center address autoconfiguration problem to the graph isomorphism (GI) problem and solve it efficiently by leveraging the data center network topology characteristics. Our designs have been evaluated and validated via extensive analysis, simulations and implementations. Particularly, we have prototyped OSA using the real optical devices and implemented DAC as an application over the Windows network stack.",

        "abstract": "A complete flow statistics report should include both flow size (the number of packets in a flow) counting and flow volume (the number of bytes in a flow) counting. Although previous studies have contributed a lot to the flow size counting problem, it is still a great challenge to well support the flow volume statistics due to the demanding requirements on both memory size and memory bandwidth in monitoring device. In this paper, we propose a DIScount COunting (DISCO) method, which is designed for both flow size and flow bytes counting. For each incoming packet of length l, DISCO increases the corresponding counter assigned to the flow with an increment that is less than l. With an elaborate design on the counter update rule and the inverse estimation, DISCO saves memory consumption while providing an accurate unbiased estimator. The method is evaluated thoroughly under theoretical analysis and simulations with synthetic and real traces. The results demonstrate that DISCO is more accurate than related work given the same counter sizes. DISCO is also implemented on the network processor Intel IXP2850 for a performance test. Using only one microengine (ME) in IXP2850, the throughput can reach up to 11.1 Gb/s under a traditional traffic pattern. The throughput increases to 39 Gb/s when employing four MEs.",

        "abstract": "Optical data center networks (DCNs) are becoming increasingly attractive due to their technological strengths compared with the traditional electrical networks. However, existing optical DCNs are either hard to scale, vulnerable to single point of failure, or provide limited network bisection bandwidth for many practical data center workloads. To this end, we present WaveCube, a scalable, fault-tolerant, high-performance optical DCN architecture. To scale, WaveCube removes MEMS, 1 a potential bottleneck, from its design. WaveCube is fault-tolerant, since it does not have single point of failure and there are multiple node-disjoint parallel paths between any pair of top-of-rack switches. WaveCube delivers high performance by exploiting multi-pathing and dynamic link bandwidth along the path. For example, our evaluation results show that, in terms of network bisection bandwidth, WaveCube outperforms prior optical DCNs by up to 400% and is 70%-85% of the ideal non-blocking network (.e., theoretical upper bound) under both realistic and synthetic traffic patterns. WaveCube's performance degrades gracefully under failures-it drops 20% even with 20% links cut. WaveCube also holds promise in practice-its wiring complexity is orders of magnitude lower than Fattree, BCube, and c-Through at scale, and its power consumption is 35% of them.",

Berberine, palmatine, coptisine and epiberberine were the main alkaloids in this herbal pair and taken as the standard indexes in the quantitative analysis with multi-components by single marker (QAMS) method, in order to calculate absorption rate constant (Ka) and evaluate intestinal absorption characteristics of these four alkaloids extracted by different extraction methods in different intestinal segments in rats. The results showed that the four alkaloids extracted by two different processes in high, medium and low doses had linear absorption properties in the small intestine segment, which conformed to zero-order absorption rate, intestinal segment than 0.99. The absorption rate constant (Ka) of decoction group was higher than that of alcohol extraction group.",

        "abstract": "Commercial Kaolinite was employed as sintering aid to reduce the sintering temperature of BaTiO 3 ceramics. The effects of Kaolinite content and sintering temperature on the densification, microstructure and dielectric properties of BaTiO 3 ceramics have been investigated. The density characterization results show that the addition of Kaolinite significantly lowered the sintering temperature of BaTiO 3 ceramics to about 1200 \u00b0C. XRD results show BaTiO 3 ceramics with a low amount of Kaolinite exhibited perovskite structure, but 10.0 wt% Kaolinite additions resulted in the formation of a secondary phase, BaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 . BaO\u2013TiO 2 \u2013Al 2 O 3 \u2013SiO 2 glass phase was formed and improved the average breakdown strength of ceramics, which was supported by SEM-EDX results. The Kaolinite content had shown a strong influence on the dielectric constant and the diffuse transition. BaTiO 3 ceramic with 4.0 wt% Kaolinite addition possessed well temperature stability of dielectric constant. Keywords Microstructures Dielectric properties BaTiO 3 Kaolinite 1 Introduction As one of the most important ferroelectric materials, BaTiO 3 -based ceramics are widely used in electronic devices such as multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) [1\u20133] and positive temperature coefficient resistors (PTCRs) [4,5] . However, BaTiO 3 ceramics are usually sintered at temperatures above 1350 \u00b0C. Therefore, it is required to develop capacitor materials which can be fully densified at a low sintering temperature. Recently, numerous researches have been applied to the sintering of BaTiO 3 -based ceramics for the purpose of lowering the sintering temperature and optimizing properties of the components and devices as well [6\u201313] . In general, the sintering temperature of BaTiO 3 ceramics can be lowered through methods as following. Firstly, chemical processing [6,7] such as sol\u2013gel method can obtain a high degree of chemical uniformity, make the mixture of reactants at the molecular level, and can obtain grains from nanometer to micrometer-size, thereby reducing the sintering temperature. Secondly, the sintering temperature can be reduced by using small grain and homogenous BaTiO 3 [8,9] , particularly for the superfine powder, since smaller particle has higher surface energy. Moreover, adding glass or oxides as sintering aids is considered to be an effective method. Several glass powders such as ZnO\u2013B 2 O 3 \u2013SiO 2 [6,10] , BaO\u2013B 2 O 3 \u2013SiO 2 [11] , and BaO\u2013SiO 2 [12] compositions have been used to decrease the sintering temperature of BaTiO 3 ceramics. Oxides [13] such as Bi 2 O 3 , B 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , and Al 2 O 3 have been added as the sintering aid, which can effectively lower the sintering temperature of BaTiO 3 -based ceramics. However, the addition of sintering aids may not always result in the desired dielectric properties which include a high and almost temperature independent dielectric constant and a low dielectric loss. This is especially true if the dielectric constant is lowered by the presence of a continuous low \u025b grain boundary phase. Therefore, it is important to choose a suitable sintering aid composition which can reduce the sintering temperature and produce densification without deterioration of dielectric properties of material. Among varieties of additives, Kaolinite which possesses high content of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 used as sintering aid was few reported. In this paper, Kaolinite used as sintering aid was discussed, aiming at obtaining high density dielectrics by low temperature sintering in the presence of an optimal amount of liquid phase without any undesirable phase formation. The microstructures and dielectric properties of BaTiO 3 ceramics were also investigated. 2 Experimental Commercial BaTiO 3 (\u226599.5%, Zhongxing Electronic Material Co. Ltd., Xiantao, China) and Suzhou Kaolinite (\u226598.0%, Impurity content: Fe 2 O 3 \u2264 0.04%, TiO 2 \u2264 0.12%, Na 2 O \u2264 0.22%, MgO \u2264 0.11%, CaO \u2264 0.10%, K 2 O \u2264 0.17%, Kaolinclay Co. Ltd., Longyan, China) powders were used as the starting materials. The Kaolinite powder was added in BaTiO 3 powder in the ratio corresponding to the following chemical composition: (100\u2013 x ) wt% BaTiO 3 \u2013 x wt% Kaolinite, where x = 0\u201310.0. These powders were weighted according to the nominal compositions, and mixed in distilled water by ball milling for 4 h. The slurries were filtered and dried at 90 \u00b0C for 8 h. The powders were granulated in a 3.0 wt% PVA (polyvinyl alcohol solution) in a proportion of 90.0 wt% of powder and 10.0 wt% of PVA solution. Disks with 13.60 mm in diameter were prepared by unidirectional pressing (60 MPa). The disks were baked at 800 \u00b0C for 30 min for binder removal. The samples were sintered at a certain temperature ranging from 1100 to 1390 \u00b0C in air. The soaking time at the sintering temperature was 2 h, while a slow heating rate of 2\u20133 \u00b0C/min aimed to prevent deformation of the samples. The crystal structure of the samples was identified using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Model D-MAX 2200pc, Rigaku Co., Tokyo, Japan), in conjunction with Cu K\u03b1 radiation, operated at 50 kV, 100 mA, and a scanning rate of 3\u02da/min within the range of 2 \u03b8 from 15\u02da to 80\u02da. Lattice parameter of samples was worked out using the Bragg law for the tetragonal system: (1) d = h 2 a 2 + k 2 a 2 + l 2 c 2 \u2212 1 / 2 Two strongest peaks in XRD patterns for each sample were chose to calculate a and c . For dielectric measurements, Ag electrodes were screen printed with Ag paste on both sides of the pellets and heat treated at 650 \u00b0C for 20 min. The DC breakdown measurement was performed using a withstanding voltage tester (Model ET2671B, Entai, Nanjing, PR China) at room temperature. All samples were immersed in silicone oil to prevent surface flashover. The frequency dependence of the dielectric properties were measured using a precision LCR Meter (Model E4980A, Agilent Tech., CA, U.S.) over a frequency range from 20 Hz to 2 MHz at room temperature, and the temperature dependence of dielectric properties were measured over a temperature range from \u221260 to 160 \u00b0C at 1 kHz. The microstructure of the sintered samples was studied on polished and then thermally etched surfaces using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Model JSM-6390A, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer for element analysis. 3 Results and discussion Bulk and relative density of BaTiO 3 ceramics with different Kaolinite additions as a function of sintering temperature were studied. The bulk density of ceramics sintered at different temperatures was measured by the Archimedes method. Nearly 94.5% of the theoretical density was obtained for pure BaTiO 3 when the sintering temperature reached to 1350 \u00b0C. For BaTiO 3 ceramics with Kaolinite addition, since Kaolinite reacted with part of BaTiO 3 during sintering (see XRD analysis), and the amount of generated phase increased with increasing Kaolinite content, it was difficult to accurately calculate the theoretical density of the sample. In order to approximately estimate the densification, assuming no interaction had taken place between Kaolinite and BaTiO 3 , the theoretical density of samples can be calculated from [14] : (2) D = ( W 1 + W 2 ) ( W 1 / D 1 + W 2 / D 2 ) where W 1 and W 2 were the weight percentages of BaTiO 3 and Kaolinite in the mixture, respectively. D 1 and D 2 , representing the theoretical density of BaTiO 3 and Kaolinite, were 6.02 and 2.62 g/cm 3 , respectively. Fig. 1 shows relative density of BaTiO 3 ceramics with different Kaolinite additions as a function of sintering temperature. The relative density of ceramics gradually increased and then decreased with increasing sintering temperature, namely, it had a maximum value. The sintering temperature corresponding to the maximum value was defined as the suitable sintering temperature (SST) [11] . The lower density shown by all samples sintered below the SST might be due to the fact that the liquid phase was too viscous to penetrate the voids between BaTiO 3 particles [15] . While the lower density above the SST can be attributed to the oversintering phenomenon. The ceramics when x = 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 10.0, obtained its SST at 1260, 1240, 1230, 1220, and 1210 \u00b0C with estimated relative densities of 94.9, 95.1, 95.7 95.6, and 95.3%, respectively. It was because more liquid phase was formed with increasing Kaolinite content, thus, solid particles were fully wetted by liquid phase, which resulted in the densification and decreasing of sintering temperature. As for the decrease in relative density when x = 10.0, it was presumably due to the crystallization of liquid phase according to the XRD results which led to less liquid phase presenting in sample and resulted in decrease of densification. It can be concluded that Kaolinite enhanced the densification of BaTiO 3 ceramics at lower sintering temperatures in the presence of liquid phase. In the rest of this paper, all the samples were prepared at their SSTs. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns for BaTiO 3 ceramics with different Kaolinite additions. The crystalline phase of pure BaTiO 3 at room temperature was tetragonal. With the addition of Kaolinite ( x = 2.0\u20138.0), no new crystalline phase was observed in the XRD results. It can be attributed to that additives are incorporated into the perovskite or as a residual glassy phase located at triple points during sintering in the presence of liquid phase. However, the lattice parameters of the perovskite phase were hardly changed, which had been calculated and were listed in Table 1 . It was suggested that the constituents of Kaolinite did not work as dopants incorporating into the perovskite lattice but reacted with part of BaTiO 3 and resulted in the formation of BaO\u2013TiO 2 \u2013Al 2 O 3 \u2013SiO 2 glass [16\u201318] locating at triple points, which was supported by the SEM-EDX evidences (see Fig. 3 ). However, when x = 10.0, tiny barium feldspar (BaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 ) phase, which was reported by Herczog [18] in the BaO\u2013TiO 2 \u2013Al 2 O 3 \u2013SiO 2 system, was formed according to the XRD analysis. It can be attributed to the crystallization of present glass which resulted from inhomogeneous distribution of Ba 2+ in glass phase during sintering. In fact, it was well known that the thermodynamic stability of a glass depended on the connectivity of the glass structure, while BaO acted as a typical glassy network modifier in the present glass, excess modifier cations would break the network linkage and make the glass easy to crystallize. The microstructure of BaTiO 3 ceramics with different Kaolinite additions was observed by SEM. Two effects of Kaolinite addition on the microstructure could be observed. On the one hand, the grain size reduced obviously. As shown in Fig. 3 , pure BaTiO 3 had large grains with an average size of over 4.0 \u03bcm, while the average grain size was reduced to about 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 \u03bcm, respectively ( x = 2.0\u20136.0). No continued reduction in the grain size was observed with further addition of Kaolinite ( x = 8.0\u201310.0). On the other hand, a uniform distribution of grain sizes was observed. It can be interpreted that the liquid phase presented at the grain boundaries hindered the ion diffusion and inhibited the grain growth. According to the EDX spectra for grain ( Fig. 3 (g)) and grain boundary ( Fig. 3 (h)) of ceramic ( x = 2.0), it was proved that a strong interaction between BaTiO 3 particles and Kaolinite occurred and resulted in the formation of BaO\u2013TiO 2 \u2013Al 2 O 3 \u2013SiO 2 glass. But, unfortunately, abnormal growth of grains and decrease in densification of sample were observed in Fig. 3 (f), it was because barium feldspar crystallized from glass phase in accordance with the XRD results. It indicated that the sintering property of BaTiO 3 ceramics can be greatly improved when x = 4.0\u20136.0. Fig. 4 shows the average breakdown strength of BaTiO 3 ceramics with different Kaolinite additions. Ten samples for each composition were measured to obtain average breakdown strength. The pure BaTiO 3 had an average breakdown strength of 3.35 kV/mm, and the breakdown strength of BaTiO 3 ceramics was remarkably improved with increasing addition of Kaolinite but a notable decrease when x = 10.0. Generally, two factors contributed to the breakdown strength of ceramics. One was the densification of sample, and the other was the distribution of grain sizes [19] . With increase in Kaolinite content, grain sizes of ceramics decreased gradually and densification of ceramics was enhanced in the presence of glass phase in accordance with Fig. 3 . However, densification of ceramics when x = 10.0 decreased resulting from crystallization of glass phase according to density analysis. Among all the measured samples, ceramics when x = 8.0 shown the highest average breakdown strength of 8.83 kV/mm, which was 2.64 times higher than that of pure BaTiO 3 . The frequency dependence of dielectric properties for BaTiO 3 ceramics with different Kaolinite additions was presented in Fig. 5 . The dielectric constant of samples gradually decreased with increase in frequency, which was particularly true for Kaolinite containing ceramics. The Kaolinite containing ceramics had higher dielectric constant than pure BaTiO 3 over the frequency range of 20\u2013100 Hz. It resulted from the space charge polarization. The glass phase, locating at the grain boundary or surrounding the grains, impeded the transfer of free charge, and then, resulted in accumulation of charges or ions in intergranular areas and, therefore, formation of macro-dipoles dispersion. In addition, the dielectric constant increased with increase in Kaolinite content ( x = 2.0\u20138.0). It was because more glass phase was formed, and which enhanced the space charge polarization effect. Meanwhile, the dielectric loss increased with increase in Kaolinite content. As for the decrease in dielectric constant when x = 10.0, it was presumably due to the crystallization of glass in accordance with the XRD results, for the barium feldspar possessed a low dielectric constant [20,21] . Conversely, the Kaolinite containing ceramics had lower dielectric constant than pure BaTiO 3 ceramic over the frequency range of 100 Hz\u20132 MHz. It was because the space charge polarization was unable to keep pace with the variation of electric field over this frequency range, and it was the orientation polarization that played a major role in polarization of ceramics. Researches [12,22] have shown that two factors contribute to the dielectric constant, one is the densification and grain size distribution of ceramic, the other is the additive amount and property of glass. In this paper, samples were prepared with well densification and suitable grain sizes. The decrease in dielectric constant with increase in Kaolinite content can be attributed to that low \u025b glass phase dilutes the high \u025b BaTiO 3 phase. As for the higher dielectric loss for Kaolinite containing ceramics over this frequency range, it was because of the higher dielectric loss of glass phase. For BaTiO 3 occupied most of the volume in BaTiO 3 ceramics with different Kaolinite additions, it can be considered as a two-phase system which is composed of a ferroelectric continuous phase (BaTiO 3 ) and a non-ferroelectric spherical phase (Kaolinite). For spherical dispersions, the effective dielectric constant of ceramics can be described using the Maxwell-Garnett (MG) effective medium theory [23,24] : (3) \u03b5 e f f = \u03b5 1 [ \u03b5 2 + 2 \u03b5 1 + 2 v f ( \u03b5 2 \u2212 \u03b5 1 ) ] [ \u03b5 2 + 2 \u03b5 1 \u2212 v f ( \u03b5 2 \u2212 \u03b5 1 ) ] where \u025b 1 is the dielectric constant of the continuous phase, \u025b 2 is the dielectric constant of the spherical phase, and v f is the volume fraction of the spherical phase. At room temperature, BaTiO 3 possesses high dielectric constant of about 2200 at 1 kHz, while Kaolinite only has 15. As shown in Fig. 6 , v f of Kaolinite was calculated from its weight ratio. According to MG theory, effective dielectric constant of BaTiO 3 ceramics with different Kaolinite additions were calculated and illustrated. Experiment data of dielectric constant for ceramics were also presented in Fig. 6 . The significant difference between theory and experiment data of dielectric constant can be attributed to the reaction between BaTiO 3 particles and Kaolinite. With increase in Kaolinite content, more BaTiO 3 particles reacted with Kaolinite, and bigger difference between theory and experiment data of dielectric constant was observed. Fig. 7 illustrates the temperature dependence of dielectric properties for BaTiO 3 ceramics with different Kaolinite additions. All samples exhibited the Curie temperature ( T c ) at about 120 \u00b0C, and the dielectric constant exhibited a broadened and diffuse ferroelectric\u2013paraelectric phase transition for Kaolinite containing samples. The diffuse phase transition was related strongly to the addition of Kaolinite. The glass phase resulting from the reaction between BaTiO 3 and Kaolinite led to the change of dielectric properties and the observation of relaxor behavior and diffuse transitions. Since the grain size decreased with addition of glass phase, more grain boundary emerged, while the phase locating at the grain boundary was mainly non-ferroelectric material. With increase addition of non-ferroelectric material, the content of ferroelectric material in ceramic decreased. According to Smolenski's composition fluctuation theory [25] , assuming the sample was divided into many micro-areas, the phase transition temperatures in each micro-area had shown a certain distribution, and the T c was the statistic of all the micro-phase transition temperatures. Since the increase in non-ferroelectric phase would make the micro-inhomogeneity of components increases, leading to the phase transition temperature varied in different micro-areas, thus causing phase transition in a wide temperature range. It also can be considered [26] the grain boundary caused a large stress against grains, and resulting in a change of the domain structure. So, the stress from the grain boundary was considered to depress the dielectric abnormality at the Curie temperature. As for the temperature dependence of dielectric loss, a dielectric loss peak was observed at about 40 \u00b0C, and this peak increased with increase in Kaolinite content ( x = 2.0\u20138.0). This is presumably due to the relaxation polarization of ceramics. The decrease of dielectric loss peak for ceramic when x = 10.0 can be attributed to the formation of barium feldspar and less glass phase remained in sample. It was proved that BaTiO 3 ceramics with 4.0 wt% Kaolinite addition possessed well temperature stability of dielectric constant. 4 Conclusions BaTiO 3 ceramics with different Kaolinite additions were prepared through conventional solid-state method. Kaolinite had a strong influence on the densification, microstructure and dielectric properties of BaTiO 3 ceramics. The density characterization results show that the addition of Kaolinite significantly lowered the sintering temperature of BaTiO 3 ceramics to about 1200 \u00b0C. BaO\u2013TiO 2 \u2013Al 2 O 3 \u2013SiO 2 glass phase was formed in accordance with the SEM-EDX analysis, leading to the reduction in the grain size and improvement of average breakdown strength of ceramics. A perovskite structure was revealed for all samples but the formation of a secondary phase, BaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 was crystallized from glass phase when the Kaolinite content reaches to 10.0 wt%. The reaction between BaTiO 3 and Kaolinite caused an uneven distribution of BaTiO 3 composition, giving rise to the strong broadening effects of the phase transition. BaTiO 3 ceramic with 4.0 wt% Kaolinite addition possessed well temperature stability of dielectric constant. These results provided useful information for the application of Kaolinite in electronic ceramics.

The microstructure, resistivity, and dielectric properties of the composites were investigated. XRD results indicated that chemical reactions between barium titanate (BaTiO 3 :BT) and molybdenum (Mo) have taken place during sintering, resulting in the formation of BaMoO 4 (BM) and BaTi 2 O 5 (BT 2 ). The resistivity decreased with the increasing amount of Mo in the composites.

The dielectric constant of the composite gradually decreased with increase in frequency at the room temperature.

Composites B. Electron microscopy C. Dielectric properties Barium molybdate 1 Introduction BT is one of the most used ferroelectric ceramic in electronics, especially in the design of electronic devices such as capacitors, dielectrics or electroactive materials [1] due to its high dielectric constant. Because of its extensive use, it has been widely studied and several methods have been proposed to enhance its dielectric constant. Panteny et al. [2] reported an increase in the relative permittivity, conductivity, coercive field and remnant polarization measured for lead zirconate titanate\u2013platinum, BT\u2013Ag, composites. Cho et al. [3] found the SrTiO 3 \u2013Pt composites exhibited high values of dielectric constant at low frequencies. Many researchers had added other metals such as Ni, Cu [1,4] , into BT. These researches indicated that these composites reveal some common and excellent properties such as elevated dielectric constant, enough electrical conductivity, and superior toughness. In this study, a novel composite was prepared by adding metal molybdenum into BT. The polycrystalline phases and dielectric behavior of barium titanate\u2013molybdenum composites were investigated. 2 Experimental The BT powder was mixed with Mo powder in a nylon container with ethanol and pestle for 4 h according to the composites of the BT\u2013 x Mo (when x = 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt.%). Mixed powders were compacted by a cold-isostatic pressing (CIP) at 60 MPa for 3 min to fabricate a 13.6 mm diameter and 1.7 mm thick green disk. The disk samples were sintered at 1280, 1290, 1300 and 1310 \u00b0C for 2 h in an argon atmosphere with a heating and cooling rates of 5\u20136 \u00b0C/min. Some of them were calcined at 750 \u00b0C in air for 2 h again. The crystalline phases of the sintered samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Cu K\u03b1, 50 kV, 100 mA, Model Rad; Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). The scan rate (2 \u03b8 ) was 3\u00b0/min at a step size of 0.02\u00b0, and the scan range was 0\u201370\u00b0. The microstructures of the sintered samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-T330). For the electrical and dielectric measurements the sintered samples were plated with In\u2013Ga electrodes. The temperature dependence of permittivity was carried out in the temperature range 25\u2013160 \u00b0C by the HP4284A impedance tester. The resistance, frequency dependence of permittivity were measured in frequency range of 20\u201310 6 Hz using the Agilent E4980A impedance tester. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of BT ceramics with different proportion of Mo addition. Based on XRD analysis, it is found that BT and BM are presented as the major phases in association with BT 2 and BaTi 4 O 9 (BT 4 ) as minor phases in the composites. The intensity of BM increases with increasing amount of Mo, meanwhile the intensity of BT decreases gradually. In addition, the intensity of BT 4 increases with the decrease of the intensity of BT 2 ( x \u2265 10 wt.%). It is indicated that a chemical reaction have occurred between BT and Mo during sintering, so BM and BT 2 as the products of the chemical reaction generate in these composites. BT 4 can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern of pure BT too, so it may be resulted from the decomposition of BT which was sintered in argon atmosphere. Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the morphologies and grains of BT ceramics with different addition content of Mo. Pure microcrystalline BM have rhombic shape and expose mostly (1 1 1) crystallographic planes [5] , the abundant amount of rhombic shape grains can be observed in the micrographs. The grain size of BM is in range of 2\u20137 \u03bcm, and the grain size of BT is about 10 \u03bcm. With increasing amount of Mo, the smaller grains (BM) appear issued from the larger grains (BT). An increasing number of rod-like BT 2 [6] grains appear in these composites with increasing amount of Mo. It is suggested that the chemical reaction between BT and Mo had occurred during sintering indeed. In order to deepen the understanding of the origin of the dielectric response in the composites, the composites which were sintered in argon gas were calcined at 750 \u00b0C again. Fig. 3 shows that the resistivity of the composite decreases with the increasing amount of Mo and the values of resistivity increase after the composites were calcined at 750 \u00b0C. In argon atmosphere BT was reduced, forming doubly ionized oxygen vacancies and free electrons in BT according to Eq. (1) : (1) O \u2192 V O + 2 e + 1 2 O 2 \u2191 The electrons make the reduced perovskite material highly semiconducting. So after sintering normal BT based dielectrics in reducing atmospheres the insulation resistance (IR) decreases by 10\u201312 orders of magnitude [7,8] . Combining with the analysis of the XRD patterns ( Fig. 1 ), we can deduce that a chemical reaction have occurred among BT, Mo and O 2 during sintering (low oxygen partial pressure), the O 2 may result from the decomposition of BT, so these chemical reactions promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies and free electrons during sintering. With increasing amount of Mo, more O 2 which results from the decomposition of BT is needed to finish these chemical reactions, so the increasing amount of oxygen vacancies and free electrons form in the composites and the resistivity of the composite decreases with increasing amount of Mo. Oxygen vacancies can be eliminated from dielectric materials by the way of re-oxidation [9] . The values of resistivity increase after the composites calcining at 750 \u00b0C, it is indicated that the oxygen atoms backfill to the perovskite lattice of BT, and the quantity of free electrons are trapped by oxygen vacancies. Analysing the dielectric constant of the composites which were sintered in argon atmosphere for the temperatures range from 25 \u00b0C to 160 \u00b0C in Fig. 4 , we observe that the composites (when x = 5 and 20 wt.%) have, lower dielectric constant than pure BT samples, especially, the dielectric constant (when x = 20 wt.%) reaches a minimum value (<10 4 at the whole temperature range). The composites (when x = 10 and 15 wt.%) still show rather high dielectric constant in the temperatures range from 25 \u00b0C to 160 \u00b0C. According to the present studies, Choi et al. reported that the dielectric constants of BM sintered at 800 \u00b0C were 7\u201311 [10] , and Kumar et al. [11] had found that the dielectric constants of specimens prepared using Ba:Ti in 1:4 molar ratio were in the range of 22\u201337 over the temperature range of 30\u2013100 \u00b0C, and the dielectric constants of BT 2 presented low value (230\u2013641) [6,12] , it can be deduced that the decreasing of dielectric constant is caused by the low values of dielectric constant of BM, BT 4 and BT 2 , it may play a leading role of the relatively lower values of dielectric constant (when x = 5 and 20 wt.%). As shown in Fig. 3 , doubly ionized oxygen vacancies and free electrons form in the BT, so the space charge distributions across interfaces generate in the composites [13] . The sharp rise in dielectric constant with temperature particularly in the low frequency range, is attributed to a major contribution from the space charge polarization with temperature [14] , and space charge polarization has a greater effect than the low values of dielectric constant of BM, BT 4 and BT 2 on the dielectric response in the composite, so the composites (when x = 10 and 15 wt.%) still show rather high dielectric constant at the temperatures range from 25 \u00b0C to 160 \u00b0C with a 1 kHz/1 V signal. The composite (when x = 5 wt.%) shows superior dielectric properties. Thus, despite that addition of Mo has the effect of reducing dielectric constant, the composite (when x = 5 wt.%) still show rather high dielectric constant (the dielectric constant >10 4 at the whole temperature range), and the T c of the composite is relatively higher than that (120 \u00b0C) of BT. The T c of the composite (when x = 5 wt.%) is relatively higher than that (120 \u00b0C) of BT, it may due to the higher T c (461 \u00b0C) of BT 2 [12] . Fig. 5 shows the frequency dependence of dielectric constant of the composites which were sintered in argon atmosphere at 1300 \u00b0C. The dielectric constant gradually decreases with increase in frequency at the room temperature. First the dielectric constant increases with increasing amount of Mo (when x = 5\u201315 wt.%), then decreases (when x = 15\u201320 wt.%), when x is 20 wt.%, the dielectric constant reduces to the minimum, it is very similar to the variations of temperature dependence of dielectric constant. It is obvious that both the space charge polarization and the low values of dielectric constant of BM, BT 4 and BT 2 have effect on frequency dependence of dielectric constant of the composites. Because of the maximum chemical composition of BM, BT 4 and BT 2 in the composite (when x = 20 wt.%), the low values of dielectric constant of BM, BT 4 and BT 2 play a leading role of the dielectric response in the composite (when x = 20 wt.%), so the dielectric constant decreases with increasing amount of Mo (when x = 15\u201320 wt.%). It is found that the dielectric constant was influenced not only by grain size but also by pore morphology [15] , a large proportion of pores appearing resulted in low dielectric constant for the materials [16] , we can observe that the largest proportion of pores appear in the composite (when x = 20 wt.%) in Fig. 2 , it may be another reason of the dielectric constant decreasing at x = 20 wt.%. 4 Conclusions A novel composite of barium titanate\u2013molybdenum were sintered in argon atmosphere by solid state reaction method. XRD and SEM results support the idea that a chemical reaction has occurred between BT and Mo during sintering, BM and BT 2 as the products of the chemical reaction generate in these composites, and the composites (when x = 5 and 10 wt.%) have the more dense microstructures in these composites. The resistivity of the composites decreases with increasing amount of Mo, it results from the increase of amount of oxygen vacancies and free electrons. The composite (when x = 5 wt.%) shows superior dielectric properties and the dielectric constant reaches to 10 4 , and the T c value of the composites is relatively higher than that (120 \u00b0C) of BT.

The effects of different volume fractions of O2 (x) on the microstructure and dielectric properties of CCTO ceramics were investigated. The appearance of Cu4O3 phase in the XRD patterns when x\u226520%, suggests that a chemical reaction had occurred between Cu2O and O2. The Gibbs energy of formation of CCTO was closely related to the ternary phase relations of system CaO-CuO/Cu2O-TiO2, and the decrease of x promoted the decomposition of CCTO. All the samples showed high dielectric constant (\u22655\u00d7103) in a broad frequency range from 20 Hz to 100 kHz, which decreased gradually with increasing x. Cole-Cole plots of conductivity suggested that the resistivity of grain and grain boundary both increased with increasing x.

        "abstract": "BaTiO 3 / x Cu composite ceramics with x = 0\u201330 wt.% were fabricated by the traditional mixing oxide method and their microstructure, relative density, electric conductivity, permittivity and dielectric loss were measured as a function of the Cu mass fraction. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicated that the dense composite has no chemical reaction between BaTiO 3 and Cu during sintering, and the relative diffraction intensity of Cu increased with the increase of Cu. The electric properties showed that the percolation threshold of BaTiO 3 /Cu composites was x = 0.25 and its conductivity increased as the Cu content increased after that. With increasing Cu content up to 30 wt.%, the permittivity ( \u025b r ) markedly increased from \u223c3000 for monolithic BaTiO 3 to \u223c8000 at 1 kHz. Additionally, the temperature coefficient of this system was less than 5% in the temperature range of 25\u2013115\u00b0C. Keywords B. Composite C. Dielectric properties Microstructure Percolation theory 1 Introduction The influences of metallic phases in ferroelectric and paraelectric materials have been investigated for various combinations such as PZT/Ag [1] , PZT/Pt [2] , BaTiO 3 /Ni [3] , BaTiO 3 /Cr [4] and SrTiO 3 /Pt systems [5] , which typically show very high dielectric constants and have been of special interest for applications related to energy storage. Often, these metallic doped composites have unique features that are distinct from the regular monolithic material. In general, these features occur in materials filled with inclusions such as highly conducting fibre distributed randomly in a host, which could demonstrate an insulator\u2013metal transition with increasing metal concentration [9] . The results show that the metallic phase acts as a bridge within the ceramic and not only improves the mechanical properties, but, according to the percolative phenomenon [6] , also changes the electrical properties of the matrix, such as the piezoelectrical properties, permittivity ( \u025b r ) and electrical conductivity. However, it has been very difficult to experimentally observe the phenomena occurring at the percolation threshold, and only a few groups have reported the effect of a strongly enhanced permittivity for ceramic\u2013metal composites in the neighborhood of the percolation threshold [7,8] . A dielectric characteristics study of the ceramic\u2013metal composites indicated that the composite's response to an applied electric field may be attributed to different types of polarization, which may be affected by varying the temperature or the electric field frequency [2] . Some high \u025b r ferroelectric BaTiO 3 ceramics could be obtained by doping with Pt, Ag and other noble metals. It is interesting to study the sintering properties and dielectric characteristics of this material that are brought about by adding Cu as the metallic phase in the BaTiO 3 matrix. In our paper, the effects of doping Cu metal into BaTiO 3 on its microstructure and dielectric properties were investigated with the purpose of developing a novel temperature-stable, high \u025b r BaTiO 3 dielectrics. 2 Experimental The starting materials were commercially available BaTiO 3 (>99.9%) and Cu powders (>99.8%). First, BaTiO 3 and Cu powders were mixed with copper content of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 wt.% by ball milling for 4 h. Then, the slurry was dried and sieved with 150 \u03bcm mesh. Next, green compacts were formed by stainless steel mold. The samples were sintered at 1290 \u00b0C in N 2 flow for 2 h. Density measurements of the sintered samples were carried out on the basis of the Archimedes principle. X-ray diffraction (D/max2200pc, 2002, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) was used to identify the phase regarding the sintered composite discs, and the microstructural characterization of composite discs was carried out using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-6390A JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). To visualize the element distributions of Ba, Ti, and Cu, analytical SEM by energy\u2013depressive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed. Finally, the polished samples were coated with In\u2013Ga as the electrodes for measuring of electric properties. The dielectric loss and frequency dependence of permittivity were evaluated in frequency range 10 2 \u201310 6 Hz using the Agilent impedance analyzer (E4980A, Agilent Tech., CA, USA). The temperature dependence of permittivity (HP4284A, Agilent Tech., CA, USA) was carried out from room temperature to 160 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion The XRD patterns of the sintered BaTiO 3 /Cu composites are shown in Fig. 1 . All peaks were attributed to either the BaTiO 3 phase or Cu without any impurities being observed, which suggests that no reaction took place between BaTiO 3 and Cu during the sintering. The relative diffraction intensity of Cu increased with the increase of Cu, which was expected. Fig. 2 shows the apparent and relative density of BaTiO 3 /Cu composites. The apparent density of BaTiO 3 /Cu composites increased with increasing amount of Cu. The SEM images of the composites with different content of Cu and the EDS spectra of x = 30 wt.% are shown in Fig. 3 . It was seen in Fig. 3 (a) and (b) that abnormal grain growth was clearly observed. The normal grain size of pure BaTiO 3 was about 1 \u03bcm, while the abnormal grain size of BaTiO 3 /Cu composites was about 50 \u03bcm. Abnormal grain growth was generally known to occur when particle shape was angular in the presence of liquid phase during sintering [10] . It is indicated that the low eutectic liquid phase formed between Cu and BaTiO 3 during sintering promoted the grain growth [15] . In Fig. 3 (c), lots of big spheroidal copper particles stood in the BaTiO 3 matrix. That is the Cu agglomerated with increasing amount of Cu. The coalescence of Cu may be caused by pores, which also contributes to the decrease of relative density of BaTiO 3 /Cu composites with increasing amount of Cu. And the spheroidal copper particles on the surface of BaTiO 3 matrix ( Fig. 3 (d)) were identified as Cu by EDS analysis ( Fig. 3 (e)). The conductivity of BaTiO 3 /Cu composites is shown in Fig. 4 . When the Cu content was 5 wt.%, the conductivity was \u223c7.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 S m \u22121 , and the percolation threshold, which is denoted by a nonlinear transition, occurred when the Cu concentration was 25 wt.%. Above the percolation threshold, the conductivity of the composites raise further but at a slower rate, which could be explained by the percolative phenomenon and the diagram of the conductivity model in Fig. 5 . According to the percolation theory [11] (1) \u03c3 \u221d \u03c3 M ( f \u2212 f c ) t \u2003 f > f c (2) \u03c3 \u221d \u03c3 D ( f c \u2212 f ) \u2212 q \u2003 f < f c where \u03c3 , \u03c3 M , \u03c3 D are the conductivity of composite materials, conductors and insulators (dielectric), respectively, f c is the percolation threshold, and t and q are the critical exponents though there has not yet been a unified understanding about the critical indices\u2019 values in academia. Still, the conductivity of the BaTiO 3 /Cu composites followed Eq. (1) when the copper content was lower than percolation threshold ( f < f c ), and the conductivity was close to that of the conductor due to the conductive particles dispersed into the matrix in clusters as shown in the model on the left in Fig. 4 . Additionally, when the amount of Cu was higher than percolation threshold ( f > f c ), as described by Eq. (2) , the conductive particles gathered into larger clusters and were interconnected into an infinite cluster; when Cu reached the critical amount, it formed a conductive pathway as shown in the model on the right in Fig. 4 . Fig. 5 shows the permittivity and dielectric loss of BaTiO 3 /Cu composites with different Cu content as a function of the frequency (a and b) of the applied electric field and temperature (c). As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the permittivity increased with increasing Cu content and attained a value of \u223c3000 when the Cu concentration was 5 wt.% and \u223c8000 when concentration was 30 wt.%. Furthermore, the variation in permittivity from a frequency of 100 Hz to 2 MHz decreased distinctly. This variation of the permittivity is due to changes in the four basic mechanisms which affect the polarization, \u03b1 t ; the mechanisms, in the order of their response times, are the electronic polarization [ \u03b1 e ], ionic polarization [ \u03b1 i ], dipolar polarization [ \u03b1 o ] and the space charge [ \u03b1 s ]. These yield the following system \u03b1 t = \u03b1 e + \u03b1 i + \u03b1 o + \u03b1 s [12,13] . The electronic polarization [ \u03b1 e ] is active at atomic vibrations and optical frequencies and beyond, ionic polarization [ \u03b1 i ] is affected at infrared frequencies (\u224810 13 Hz). The space charge [ \u03b1 s ] mechanism could require some time to build up and, therefore, corresponds to fractions of a kHz. The space charge mechanism had an important role in this system, because there were many space charges generated between BaTiO 3 and Cu, and the quantity of space charges rose with the increasing amount of Cu. Consequently, the permittivity of BaTiO 3 /Cu composites increased significantly with increasing Cu content, and the maximum value was \u223c8000 when the concentration was 30 wt.% at 1 kHz. This large increase in permittivity at the lower frequencies was mainly attributed to polarization due to the space charge mechanism as well. When the applied frequency was much higher than the natural frequency of the dipole, the dipole was not able to react and consequently did not contribute to the permittivity. The frequency dependence of dielectric loss of BaTiO 3 /Cu composites is shown in Fig. 5 (b). The dielectric loss increased with increasing Cu content and decreased with increasing frequency from 100 Hz to 1 MHz due to the raised of conductance loss and reduced of the space charge polarization. Dependence of permittivity and dielectric loss of BaTiO 3 /Cu composites on frequency could also be explained by percolation theory [11] (3) \u03b5 = \u03b5 D f c \u2212 f f c \u2212 q where \u025b , \u025b D are the permittivity of composites and the matrix, respectively. When f < f c , as the permittivity increases, the dielectric loss was not increased significantly with increasing Cu content. This was because the introduction of metal phase generally causes the increasing of dielectric loss, but the dielectric properties of BaTiO 3 was closely related to the internal stress and grain size of the BaTiO 3 [14] , the introduced flexible metal particles could reduce the internal stress of the dielectric loss at a great degree, which can be seen from x = 0\u201320 wt.% in Fig. 5 (b). But as Cu content reached to f c , the conductivity increased and the conductance loss increased obviously resulting in dielectric loss began to increase significantly. The variation in the permittivity from room temperature to the peak temperature (130 \u00b0C) was 3.12 \u00d7 10 4 when the Cu concentration was 30 wt.%, as shown in Fig. 5 (c). Below the transition temperature, the permittivity increased very little as the temperature increased to 115 \u00b0C, which indicated that BaTiO 3 /Cu composite ceramics were stable within that temperature range and useful as large \u025b r BaTiO 3 dielectrics. 4 Conclusions BaTiO 3 /Cu composite ceramics without other secondary phases were prepared using a traditional solid-phase method. Resistivity of the BaTiO 3 /Cu composite ceramics increased with increasing Cu content and followed the percolation theory with the percolation threshold of the BaTiO 3 /Cu composite being 25 wt.%. The permittivity increased as the amount of Cu increased and attained the value of \u223c3000 when the concentration was 5 wt.% and \u223c8000 when it was 30 wt.% at 1 kHz. Below the transition temperature (130 \u00b0C), the temperature coefficient of composite ceramics was less than 5% in the temperature range 25\u2013115 \u00b0C, and thus the ceramic would be a highly stable dielectric with high permittivity.

On the basic phenomenon that the laser induced plasma would sustain for a while even after the laser beam passed through out of the workpiece during high power CO2 laser welding, a simple and effective method is developed to record the effect of plasma on the focusing laser beam. It is found that the laser-induced plasma enlarges the diameter of the focused laser beam and the focus shifts downward significantly. This \"lensing effect\" of the laser-induced plasma becomes more serious with the increase of the plasma height. Compared with the absorption of plasma, the \"lensing effect\" is the main mechanism for plasma shielding in the process of high power CO2 laser welding.",

The experiment results show that the addition of the metal powder enhances the energy coupling efficiency during laser welding and a stable welding process can be obtained. Meanwhile, only when the powder beam aims at the appropriate area, it can be sure to enter the weld pool efficiently. When a certain amount of powder is given, welding speeds need to be matched with proper power and power density to make sure that the powder can be utilize availably. Finally, the good appearance of weld with proper reinforcemert height as well as the stable welding process can be obtained through optimizing the parameters.",

The weld metal comes from three parts of stainless steel, powder Ni35, and Cu in W-Cu PMM. It is indicated that some parts of the W-Cu base metal are heated by laser and the metal Cu at the width of 0.06-0.12 mm from the edge is melted into the melting pool in the laser welding process. The formation of firm weld joint is just because that the melting liquid metal could fill the position occupied by metal Cu and surround the metal W granules fully. The analysis results indicate that the mechanism of the laser welding for stainless steel and W-Cu alloy is a special mode of fusion-brazing welding.",

Filler wire technique was employed in laser butt joint, with different gaps, of cast magnesium alloy and the control for the pores and welding quality of cast magnesium alloy was achieved. The results showed that the stability and the pore rate of cast magnesium alloy in laser welding were affected mainly by the pore rate in substrate alloy. For the cast magnesium alloy with the rate of 1-3% , when filler wire technique was adopted the pore rate was from 1. 5% down to 0. 31 %. For the cast magnesium alloy with the rate of 6-10 % , in same way, the pore rate was from 20% down to 3 %. The normal laser welding process could be had in this case.",

In this experimental work reported, CO2 laser beam autogenous welding and wire feed welding are conducted on 4 mm thick 5083-H321 aluminum alloy sheets at different welding variables. The mechanical properties and microstructure characteristics of the welds are evaluated through tensile tests, micro-hardness tests, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experimental results indicate that both the tensile strength and hardness of laser beam welds are affected by the constitution of filler material, except the yield strength. The soften region of laser beam welds is not in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). The tensile fracture of laser beam welded specimens takes place in the weld zone and close to the weld boundary because of different filler materials. Some pores are found on the fracture face, including hydrogen porosities and blow holes, but these pores have no influence on the tensile strength of laser beam welds. Tensile strength values of laser beam welds with filler wire are up to 345.57 MPa, 93% of base material values, and yield strengths of laser beam welds are equivalent to those of base metal (264.50 MPa).",

        "title": "Influence of the wire addition direction in CO2 laser welding of aluminum",
        "abstract": "Laser beam welding of aluminum alloys is expected to offer both the technical and economical advantages. In most cases welding wire addition is necessary from the viewpoints to suppress hot cracks, improve mechanical properties of the weld as well as to reduce demands on the edge preparation, fit-up tolerance, and beam alignment. In practice, the filler wire could be added to the weld pool either in the leading or trailing direction. In this experimental work reported, the influence of the wire addition direction on the weld efficiency and process stability was investigated by using a 5kW CO2 laser to weld aluminum alloy 6009 with a plate thickness of 3mm. Beam-on-plate welds were made either in the autogeneous mode or with filler wire AlSi12. Illuminated by a double frequency Nd:YAG laser, the weld pool dynamics and the wire melting process were observed applying a high speed camera. The experimental results demonstrate that welding with filler wire in the trailing direction is more efficient and stable than in the leading direction. High speed camera photographs show that the filler wire is mainly melted through weld pool heating and plasma heating in the former case and through direct laser irradiation and plasma heating in the later case. The weld pool is of vibration when welding in the autogeneous mode or with filler wire in the leading direction. However, the weld pool is much calmer when the wire is added in the trailing direction to the weld pool.",

The observed result of the experiment is analyzed on the base of the picture collected by the high-speed camera together with the data from the Laserscope UFF100, and the optimized parameters ranges are obtained. The experiment results show that, only when the powder beam aims at the area that is near the crystallization edge, and 0.5-1 mm away from the facula, it can be sure to enter the weld pool efficiently. When a certain amount of powder is given, welding speeds need to be matched with proper power and power density to make sure that the powder can be utilize availably. Finally, the well-formed weld with proper exceeded height as well as the stable welding process can be obtained through optimizing the parameters.",

The laser welding of Al alloy with thin plate was a difficult thing especially in the butt form of the thickness 0.5mm to 0.5mm and the fillet form of unequal thickness case. Blow hole and pore in the welding bead and deformation, usually, were the main defects. The welding parameters were tested and determined in the study. For the butt welding, the parameters of 1200W laser power with pulse mode and 1.8m/min welding rate were used for making a full penetration of weld bead and a smooth weld surface. The blow hole and pore were easily kept in weld bead when the power of 800W and 1500W was used. It was strongly depended on the pore tendency of Al-Mg alloy in the laser welding and the unstable welding process. For the fillet welding, the parameters of 1300W - 1500W laser power with pulse mode, 1.8m/min welding rate, a angle of 15 degree between laser beam and vertical plane were used to get a high quality weld bead. In order to control the distortion of plate, a special method was designed and made for fixing the parts and keeping them in correct position. The experimental data showed that the best result was got when the copper cooling board was employed.",

But it can be eliminated by blowing air with a certain pressure into the beam's guidance system. Also, the behavior of the beam's propagation under the case of the thermal lens deviates from Gaussian theory. This deviation is calculated by the linear and nonlinear models of the atmospheric thermal lens under the conditions of a large beam diameter and high power intensity.

In order to get the theoretic gists for designing the structure of nozzle and adjusting the technological parameter, the jet's form of double-layer nozzle used in laser welding was systemically researched in the experiment by a two-reflector schlieren instrument and analysed with the principle of aerodynamics. The results showed that, in the case without laser kindling, to obtain the satisfying length in laminar flow of shielding gas and velocity of flow, the Reynolds-number of single-layer nozzle's free-jet should range from 400 to 700. Nevertheless, for the double-layer nozzle, the Reynolds-numbers of the inner and the outer layer should be kept close to each other in order to get the best laminar flow form. Several gas outflow forms about nozzles and a protect-curtain are also shown in this paper.",

Experiment results showed that a successful laser welding should be with some technique and skills. So a special clamp apparatus was made for fixing the parts and keeping them in correct position. The welding parameters were tested and determined in the study. For the main part of welding, 3000W laser power, 3m/min welding rate, a angle of 15 degree between laser beam and vertical plane were used and had a full penetration of weld bead and a smooth bead surface. For the beginning and the ending part, the ramp function had to be used to overcome the weld defects of burning though and inadequate joint penetration. Also, the spot position at the beginning and the ending in the welding process should be adapted to make a good joint. In order to eliminate the influence of laser induced plasma that produced from the surface of galvanized sheet when it was heated by laser energy, a flow of argon gas with the rate of 10 1/min as a side gas was employed. The experiment results indicated that the method of a teaching program was not enough for having a good welding quality because of the flutter phenomena by the non-uniform motion of machining head in the processing. Instead of it, the offline program was employed.",

        "abstract": "As a precondition of laser welding, the plate of Al-Li alloy wasn't treated before welding. A DC035 CW CO2 laser, in the TEM00 mode, with output up to 3500 W, was employed to experimentally study the porosity control of 1420 Al-Li alloy by dual-beam laser welding. The experimental results show that the influence from the surface oxide film on the porosity in weld is deeper than that from the backside one when the laser welding is in the form of beam on the surface of plate. However, welding porosity has a distinct connection with the sensibility of backside oxide film and the backside formation in the weld when the butt joint laser welding is carried out. The optimized laser welding techniques were achieved experimentally to decrease the porosity in weld and increase the weld qualities. The tensile strength of welded joints of butt joint laser welding was experimentally tested too. The data indicate that the average tensile strength of the joints could reach up to 336.1 MPa, which is equal to 87.5% of the substrate alloy.",

In this experimental work reported, CO2 laser beam autogenous welding and wire feed welding are conducted on 4 mm thick 5083-H321 aluminum alloy sheets at different welding variables. The mechanical properties and microstructure characteristics of the welds are evaluated through tensile tests, micro-hardness tests, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experimental results indicate that both the tensile strength and hardness of laser beam welds are affected by the constitution of filler material, except the yield strength. The soften region of laser beam welds is not in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). The tensile fracture of laser beam welded specimens takes place in the weld zone and close to the weld boundary because of different filler materials. Some pores are found on the fracture face, including hydrogen porosities and blow holes, but these pores have no influence on the tensile strength of laser beam welds. Tensile strength values of laser beam welds with filler wire are up to 345.57 MPa, 93% of base material values, and yield strengths of laser beam welds are equivalent to those of base metal (264.50 MPa).",

        "abstract": "Affected by phase shifts, the transverse intensity distribution (TID) of high-power blending mode CO2 laser beams will be changed regularly in different position along their propagation path. Because of different defocus value for focal laser beams, when the TID of positive defocus is more concentrated than that of negative defocus, the welding quality of positive defocus will be better than that of negative defocus. Therefore, the conventional knowledge on welding quality that negative defocus is better than that of positive defocus is broken. Moreover, the TIDs of focus in different processing position are also different when using \u2033flying optics\u2033 to guide laser beam so that the welding qualities are different, too. It is generally considered that if one laser beam's quality is definitive, the welding quality should be the same under the same processing parameters. However, for one blending mode laser beam, because of the different TIDs in different processing position, the welding quality is also different. So it is not enough to use beam quality to judge the welding ability of a laser beam. The influence of fine structure of TIDs on laser beam welding quality is more important. The beams studied in this paper is of high-power blending mode CO2 laser beams whose mode composition are about 20% of TEM00 and 80% of TEM02. In different processing position of flying optics, the TIDs of focus will present crater and mountain profiles. The two kinds of profile influence differentially the shape of laser welding seam. It is shown from our research that the welding quality of mountain profile is better than that of crater profile.",

The order of the plasma shielding threshold for different gasses is as following from low to high value: Ar\u2192N2\u2192CO2\u2192He. The high ionization energy and good thermal conductivity of helium, contribute to its excellent specificity to suppress the generation and propagation of the LSC wave.

        "abstract": "Two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, one derived from a cross between Zhongyouzao 8 (indica) and Toyonishiki (japonica) and the other from a cross between Qishanzhan (indica) and Akihikari (japonica), were grown in Liaoning and Sichuan Provinces, China, to study the panicle type index (PTI, the ratio of a number of node position on panicle axis where the secondary branch with the most numerous secondary branch grains is located to the number of primary branches) and its relationships with subspecies characteristics and yield traits. With continuous distribution of PTI and numerous of lines with different PTIs in the progenies, indica-japonica hybridization could be a method for breeding cultivars with ideal panicle type. PTI was significantly influenced by environments, with a significant decrease from Liaoning to Sichuan. A significantly negative correlation was found between PTI and most of subspecies characteristics. PTI varied remarkably with different subspecies types. As a whole, it showed a trend of indica (H)>indicalinous (H')>japonicalinous (K')>japonica (K). However, it is not appropriate to regard PTI as a parameter for subspecies classification in rice because it was recombined in the filial generations of cross between indica and japonica rice. The negative correlations were found between PTI and most of panicle characteristics, as well as yield-related traits. Based on PTI, most of lines from the two populations were middle dominant panicle type (the number of grains on the secondary branch is numerous in middle position of the panicle) and lower dominant panicle type (the number of grains on the secondary branch is numerous in lower position of the panicle and becomes less towards the top of panicle) with significant yield advantages.",

        "abstract": "In 2006-2007,the F8 (92 lines) and F9 (142 lines) generations of the recombinant inbred lines (RILs) populations derived from a cross between Qishanzhan (indica cultivar) and Akihikari (japonica cultivar) were used to investigate the Cheng's index (ChI) and performance of indica/japonica diagnostic SSR markers (Dj value),and 11 rice quality traits. In the study,ChI was used to represent morphological differentiation (ChI<14,indica type; ChI\u226514,japonica type) and Dk value was to display genetic differentiation,which is number of SSR loci identical to those of Akihikari divided by total number of SSR loci identical to Akihikari and Qishanzhan (Dj<50,indica type; ChI\u226550,japonica type). Both F8 and F9 populations showed a normal distribution in the ChI and Dj values. The number of lines with indica type was similar to those with japonica type based on the ChI values,whereas an obvious japonica-inclined distribution was found based on the Dj values in the two populations. There was no significant difference in most rice quality traits except milled rice width between indica and japonica types classified by the ChI values. Based on the Dj values,the two RILs populations could be divided into japonicalinous type (Dj<75) and japonica type (Dj\u226575). The japonica type showed significantly higher brown rice rate,milled rice rate and milled rice width,and significantly lower ratio of milled rice length to width than the japonicalinous type. The Cheng's index had no significant relationship with all the rice quality traits in the two generations. The Dj value had significantly positive correlations with brown rice rate,milled rice rate and milled rice width,and significantly negative correlation with the ratio of milled rice length to width. It is suggested that there was no significant correlation between the morphological differentiation and rice quality traits in japonica rice in northern China,and the milled rice quality could be improved through increasing japonica component in genetic differentiation.",

Expression of hTM mRNA was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, hTM antigen on HUVECs membrane by immunohistochemistry, and activated protein C (PC) in HUVECs by chronometry. By using a semiautomatic coagulator, the effect of the reacting liquid from transfected HUVECs mixed with PC from normal peripheral blood was assayed.About 10% HUVECs were transfected by pcDNA3.1/hTM with high-level hTM mRNA and protein expression. Activated PC produced by pcDNA3.1/hTM group, pcDNA3.1(+)/neo group and untransfected group was (2.80 +/- 0.43) microg/ml, (0.75 +/- 0.08) microg/ml and (0.85 +/- 0.11) microg/ml, respectively.

We identified 61 patients who received NAC before breast-conserving surgery. A nonrandomized unmatched cohort of 295 patients without history of receiving NAC were also included in this study. Clinicopathological features and follow-up data were abstracted and analyzed. Patients in the NAC-treated group had more advanced diseases when compared with patients in the nonNAC-treated group. With a median follow-up of 42 months, the LRR-free survival rate of patients with positive CMs was significantly lower than that of patients with negative CMs in the NAC-treated group. This distinction was not observed in the nonNAC-treated group. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that positive CM was the only independent predictive factor for LRR in the NAC-treated group but not in nonNAC-treated patients. CM status had different predictive efficacy for LRR in different settings. Association between CM status and LRR was observed in NAC-treated patients rather than nonNAC-treated patients. More extensive surgical treatment might be needed in NAC-treated patients when their CMs are positive.",

Five different surrogate subtypes were created using combined expression of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2. Locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were calculated.The 5-year LRRFS, DMFS, and DFS rates were 90.5%, 88.2%, and 81.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that young age, node-positive disease, and HER2 enrichment were independent prognostic factors in LRRFS patients. There was also an independent prognostic role of lymph node-positive disease in DMFS and DFS patients. Patients with luminal A tumors had the most favorable prognosis, with LRRFS, DMFS, and DFS rates of 93.2%, 91.5%, and 87.5% at 5 years, respectively. Conversely, HER-2-enriched tumors exhibited the highest rate of recurrence (27.5%) and locoregional recurrence (11.4%).Surrogate subtypes present with significant differences in RFS, DMFS, and LRRFS. Luminal A tumors have the best prognosis, whereas HER2-enriched tumors have the poorest.",

The purpose of this study was to validate and compare these models in Chinese patients. A total of 159 breast cancer patients with positive SLNs treated at our institution were included. Among them, 81 (50.9%) patients had at least one NSLN involvement. The Cambridge, Mou, Mayo, Tenon, MDA, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), Ljubljana, SNUH, Turkish, Louisville, Stanford, and Saidi models were evaluated and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and false negative (FN) rates. The Cambridge and Mou models outperformed the others, both with area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of 0.73. The Mayo, Tenon, MDA, MSKCC, Turkish, Ljubljana, SNUH, and Louisville models had AUCs of 0.68, 0.66, 0.66, 0.64, 0.63, 0.62, 0.61, and 0.60, respectively. The Stanford and Saidi models did not present any discriminative capabilities, with AUCs of 0.54 and 0.50, respectively. The Cambridge, MSKCC, and Mayo models were well calibrated. With adjusted thresholds, the Mayo model outperformed the others by classifying the highest proportion of patients (20%) into the low-risk group. Our study revealed that the Cambridge and Mou models performed well in Chinese patients. The ROC curves, calibration plots, and FN rates should be used together for the accurate evaluation of prediction models. Selection of these models should be based on the clinicopathological features of the targeted population. The models specifically designed for patients with micrometastases or macrometastases of SLNs are needed in the future.",

        "abstract": "This prospective cohort study aimed to compare the efficacy of cavity margins (CMs) and lumpectomy margins (LMs) for pathological assessment in breast-conserving surgery.We assessed the CMs and LMs of 163 breast cancer patients during breast-conserving surgery. We compared and analyzed the positivity rates of CM and LM.The positivity rate of CM at the case level and individual margin level was 30.7% and 8.0%, respectively. The positivity rate of LM was 12.3%, 33.1%, and 45.4% at the case level and 1.8%, 6.2%, and 9.1% at the individual margin level, when we used the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project criteria (ink-free), 1 mm-free criteria and 2 mm-free criteria, respectively. The positivity rate of LM with 1 mm-free criteria was similar to that of CM. Delivery of neoadjuvant chemotherapy increased the positivity rate of CM (50.0% versus 25.2%; P < 0.01) but not LM (41.6% versus 30.7%; P > 0.05) at the case level, whereas the positivity rate of CM and LM both increased after neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the margin level (CMs: 15.5% versus 5.6%, P < 0.001; and LMs: 10.7% versus 4.9%, P < 0.001). In univariate and multivariate analysis, delivery of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, higher node-positive stage, and presence of ductal carcinoma in situ component were correlated with positive CM, whereas positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status and higher node-positive stage were associated with positive LM.Ink-free criteria may be insufficient for LM assessment in breast-conserving surgery, and at least 1 mm width LM is suggested. After the delivery of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, CM assessment should be routinely performed in addition to LM assessment.",

        "abstract": "Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard treatment for breast cancer patients with clinically negative axilla. For patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was required. However, approximately a half of the SLNs-positive patients were found to have clear axillary lymph nodes after ALND, indicating that they had received unnecessary ALND without therapeutic benefit. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis for solution of this clinical problem. We defined the second echelon lymph nodes (SELNs) as those nodes receiving lymphatic drainage directly from the SLNs. For patients with positive-SLNs, SELNs can be biopsy and assessed. If SELNs are negative, no more ALND was needed in these patients even if their SLNs are positive. If our hypothesis were confirmed to be true, we can tailored our axillary treatment to more breast cancer patients, avoiding unnecessary ALND and its complications.",

Research has revealed an elevated expression of miR-221 in adriamycinresistant MCF-7/ADR cells.

The correlations between miR-221 and clinicopathological features and chemosensitivity were also analysed.The expression level of miR-221 was significantly associated with hormone receptor (HR) status (p = 0.008). Patients with higher plasma miR-221 levels tended to be HR-negative. Patients with different miR-221 levels had significant differences in the overall response rate (p = 0.044) but not in the pathologic complete response rate (p = 0.477).Our results indicate that plasma miR-221 may be a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to NAC in breast cancer patients.",

We focused on the six nomograms (Cambridge, MSKCC, Mayo, MDA, Tenon, and Stanford) that are the most widely validated. The AUCs were converted to odds ratios for the meta-analysis. In total, the Cambridge, Mayo, MDA, MSKCC, Stanford, and Tenon models were validated in 2,156, 2,431, 843, 8,143, 3,700, and 3,648 patients, respectively. The pooled AUCs for the Cambridge, MDA, MSKCC, Mayo, Tenon, and Stanford models were 0.721, 0.706, 0.715, 0.728, 0.720, and 0.688, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that in populations with a higher micrometastasis rate in the SLNs, the Tenon and Stanford models had a significantly higher predictive accuracy. A meta-regression analysis revealed that the SLN micrometastasis rate, but not the NSLN-positivity rate, was associated with improved predictive accuracy in the Tenon and Stanford models. The performance of the MSKCC and Cambridge models was not influenced by these two factors. All of these prediction models perform better than random chance. The Stanford model seems to be relatively inferior to the other models. The accuracy of the Tenon and Stanford models is influenced by the tumor burden in the SLNs.",

After an initial lumpectomy with intent to obtain \u22651-cm margins, separate specimens 1 \u00d7 1 cm, 0.5-cm thick were taken from the cavity margin circumferentially. These were frozen without reference to the side of the new margin as a time-saving measure, and parallel sections of the resected surface were evaluated.After a median follow-up of 55.5 months, a cumulative 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival rate of 95.3%, metastasis-free survival rate of 97.8%, disease-free survival rate of 88.3%, and overall survival rate of 96.0%, was achieved. The CM positivity rates were of no statistical difference when <7, 7-8, and >8 CMs were assessed. The second operation rate was 3.5% because of the false-negative results of the frozen section analysis on CMs. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that a higher pN stage and cT stage as well as a lack of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation demonstrated significantly worse clinical outcomes. Locoregional recurrences and metastasis are both correlated with worse overall survival. The number of the CMs assessed was not associated with clinical outcomes.The modified CM assessment presented here is a rapid, accurate, and oncologically safe approach for margin evaluation in BCS patients. Lumpectomy margin assessment might be spared when this method is used.",

        "abstract": "In premenopausal women, endocrine adjuvant therapy for breast cancer primarily consists of tamoxifen alone or with ovarian suppressive strategies. Toremifene is a chlorinated derivative of tamoxifen, but with a superior risk-benefit profile. In this retrospective study, we sought to establish the role of toremifene as an endocrine therapy for premenopausal patients with estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer besides tamoxifen.Patients with early invasive breast cancer were selected from the breast tumor registries at the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital (China). Premenopausal patients with endocrine responsive breast cancer who underwent standard therapy and adjuvant therapy with toremifene or tamoxifen were considered eligible. Patients with breast sarcoma, carcinosarcoma, concurrent contralateral primary breast cancer, or with distant metastases at diagnosis, or those who had not undergone surgery and endocrine therapy were ineligible. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were the primary outcomes measured. Toxicity data was also collected and compared between the two groups.Of the 810 patients reviewed, 452 patients were analyzed in the study: 240 received tamoxifen and 212 received toremifene. The median and mean follow up times were 50.8 and 57.3 months, respectively. Toremifene and tamoxifen yielded similar overall survival values, with 5-year overall survival rates of 100% and 98.4%, respectively (p = 0.087). However, recurrence-free survival was significantly better in the toremifene group than in the tamoxifen group (p = 0.022). Multivariate analysis showed that recurrence-free survival improved independently with toremifene (HR = 0.385, 95% CI = 0.154-0.961; p = 0.041). Toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups with no women experiencing severe complications, other than hot flashes, which was more frequent in the toremifene patients (p = 0.049). No patients developed endometrial cancer.Toremifene may be a valid and safe alternative to tamoxifen in premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Over the past four decades, chemotherapy has played an important role in prolonging survival in breast cancer patients. However, it may also result in undesirable side effects such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation seen in this study. With the increasing use of chemotherapy paralleling the rise in breast cancer incidence, the occurrence of HBV reactivation is likely to further increase. Several strategies use lamivudine to deal with this problem. Initially, lamivudine had been used to treat patients who developed alanine transaminase elevation attributable to HBV reactivation during chemotherapy. However, using this strategy, fatal reactivation has also been reported. Later studies have suggested that prophylactic lamivudine significantly reduces HBV reactivation and its associated morbidity. However, these studies were based mainly on patients with lymphoma, whereas studies on breast cancer patients were few. Moreover, these studies were retrospective. Recently, a prospective study has recommended that deferred preemptive lamivudine could be a comparable alternative to the prophylactic strategy. However, it was not a randomized controlled study. In this study, it was examined the efficacy of the prophylactic strategy in hepatitis B s-antigen seropositive breast cancer patients during chemotherapy using a prospective, randomized controlled study. Two groups were studied. One group consisted of 21 patients who were treated with prophylactic lamivudine, the other group consisted of 21 patients who were not treated with prophylactic lamivudine. The results showed that the prophylactic lamivudine strategy significantly decreased the incidence of HBV reactivation (0 vs. 28.6%, P = 0.021). It was conclude that the prophylactic lamivudine strategy significantly reduces the incidence of HBV reactivation for hepatitis B s-antigen seropositive breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.",

Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that multiple lesions, a larger lesion size, and a hematoma were independent risk factors for recurrence. Patients with in situ recurrence tended to have fewer lesions and more samples taken per lesion. Patients with new lesions tended to have multiple lesions. After re-excisions, there was no second recurrence events observed in the patients with local recurrence (0/30), whereas 5 patients with new lesions (5/14) were noted to have second recurrence events.Ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy for the complete excision of breast benign diseases is safe and effective. Local recurrence and new lesions may have different clinicopathological features and underlying mechanisms. Different management might be given to patients with a different pattern of recurrence.",

        "abstract": "With the purpose of minimizing arm lymphedema after axillary staging surgeries in breast cancer patients, the axillary reverse mapping (ARM) technique has been developed to identify and preserve arm drainage system during axillary surgery. This study aimed to clarify risk factors for metastasis in arm lymphatic drainage system in breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillary nodes.Sixty-nine patients who underwent successful both sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) and ARM from October 2009 to August 2010 were enrolled in this study. Radioactive tracer was used for SLN localization and blue dye was used for ARM. All of the identified SLNs and ARM nodes were sent for pathological assessment.ARM nodes metastasis occured in 6 of 69 patients. Age, pathological tumor size (pT) and pathological lymph node status (pN) were not associated with ARM nodes metastasis (P > 0.01). Interestingly, in these 6 patients, all metastatic ARM nodes coincided with SLN-ARM nodes (hot SLN and blue ARM node were the same lymph node). In 50 of 69 patients whose ARM nodes did not coincided with SLNs, all ARM nodes were negative, even in 12 patients with metastatic SLNs.Crossover between breast and ipsilateral arm lymphatic drainage system contributes for ipsilateral arm lymph node metastasis. When ARM and SLNB are simultaneously performed in a patient, selectively preservation of the ARM nodes that do not coincided with SLNs would be safe, even if the SLNs are positive. Pathological lymph node status does not account for the occurrence of metastasis in ARM nodes. ARM nodes could be preserved safely, independent of the pathological lymph node status.",

        "abstract": "Recent observational studies showed that breast-conserving surgery (BCS) resulted in superior survival compared to mastectomy in breast cancer patients. This study compared the clinical outcomes of BCS and mastectomy using propensity score (PS) matching analysis, which had advantages over conventional methods in reducing bias. Nonmetastatic breast cancer patients who underwent BCS and mastectomy were matched 1:1 based on their PS. We used the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox-regression model to estimate the treatment effects. A total of 2,866 patients with a median follow-up time of 67 months were included in the original study population. Although the mastectomy cohort (N=1,219) had more advanced disease compared to the BCS cohort (N=1,647), LRFS was similar between the two groups (93.8% vs. 92.4%, P>0.05). BCS (vs. mastectomy) was associated with improved DFS (73.8% vs. 58.7%, P<0.01) and CSS (91% vs. 78.2%, P<0.01) in the original population. In the PS-matched population (N=1,668), clinicopathological features were equally distributed between the two cohorts. BCS (vs. mastectomy) was not associated with improved DFS (70.7% vs. 66.9%, P>0.05) or CSS (87.5% vs. 84.9%, P>0.05). We found that PS methods reduce bias when estimating treatment effects using observational data. BCS and mastectomy show equivalent outcomes in nonmetastatic breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "This study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to compare breast-conserving surgery (BCS) rates across patients with different molecular subtypes.We identified female breast cancer patients who were diagnosed between 2010 and 2012 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients without available critical clinicopathological information were excluded. The chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to investigate factors associated with BCS.This study identified 85,415 T1\u20132N0\u20133M0 breast cancer patients. Among the patients with HR+/HER2\u2212, HR+/HER2+, HR\u2212/HER2+, and HR\u2212/HER2\u2212 diseases, 63.5% (38,823/61,142), 51.2% (4850/9473), 43.2% (1740/4030), and 55.7% (6000/10,770), respectively, received BCS (P\u200au003c\u200a0.01). Patients with HR\u2212/HER2+ (odds ratio 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.54\u20130.62) disease were significantly less likely to receive BCS than patients with HR+/HER2\u2212 disease after adjustment for T-stage, N-stage, age, tumor grade, county type, and race. Differences in BCS rates between the HR+/HER2\u2212 and HR\u2212/HER2+ subgroups were 29.1%, 14.0%, 10.1%, 8.5%, and 0.2% in patients with tumor sizes u003c10\u200amm, 10 to 20\u200amm, 20 to 30\u200amm, 30 to 40\u200amm, and 40 to 50\u200amm, respectively. Differences in BCS rates between the HR+/HER2\u2212 and HR\u2212/HER2+ subgroups were 20.3% and 5.7% in node-negative and node-positive patients, respectively. BCS rates in patients with grades I, II, and III tumors in the HR+/HER2\u2212 and HR\u2212/HER2+ subgroups were 72.2% and 34.6%, 62.7% and 42.3%, and 54.7% and 43.4%, respectively.Our study demonstrated that BCS rates varied significantly across molecular subtypes, especially in patients with lower tumor burden. HR+/HER2\u2212 and HR\u2212/HER2+ patients exhibited the highest and lowest BCS rates, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Proceedings: AACR 107th Annual Meeting 2016; April 16-20, 2016; New Orleans, LABackground: Breast cancer patients with high proportion of cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are more chemotherapy-resistant and have unfavorable clinical outcomes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, which regulate key features of BCSCs. Since BCSCs have unique miRNA expression profile, we hypothesized that a biology-driven model based on BCSC-associated miRNAs could provide prognostic information for low recurrent-risk HR+HER2- breast cancer patients.Methods: A systematic literature reviewing suggested 50 BCSC-associated miRNAs that regulate the BCSC features. We excluded 15 of these miRNAs as they were not constantly detectable in the 40 paraffin embedded tumor samples by qRT-PCR (A pilot assay). A total of 35 BCSC-associated miRNAs were identified. We randomly assigned 303 patients into a training group (n = 202) and an internal validation (n = 101) group. We built a 10-miRNA-based classifier using a LASSO Cox model in the training group and validated its prognostic in the internal validation group, and two external independent groups of 308 patients.Results: In this multicenter study, we developed build a 10-miRNA classifier to predict disease-relapse free survival (DRFS). With this classifier, HR+HER2- breast cancer patients were classified into high-risk and low-risk group of diseases recurrence. The DFS was significantly different between these two groups in all of the patient groups. In the training group, the 5-year DRFS was 90.83% and 35.0% for the low-risk and the high-risk group, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 15.85, 95% CI 8.15-30.82; pu003c0\u20220001). In the internal validation group, the 5-year DRFS was 91.95% and 7.14% for the low-risk and the high-risk group, respectively (HR 20.62, 95% CI 8.31-51.20; pu003c0\u20220001). Furthermore, in the 1st external validation group, the 5-year DRFS for low-risk group and high-risk group were 87.50% and 37.50%, respectively (HR 6.623, 95% CI 3.54-12.39; pu003c0\u20220001). In the 2nd external validation group, it was 91.74% for the low-risk group and 57.14% for the high-risk group (HR 6.99, 3.12-15.64; pu003c0\u20220001). Moreover, the 10-miRNA-based classifier outperformed the traditional clinicopathological risk factors and IHC4 scoring in predicting the 5-year DRFS. In addition, the patients in the high-risk group were associated with a more favorable response to chemotherapy than the low-risk group (HR 1.806, 95% CI 1.10-2.98; p = 0.0278).Interpretation: Our 10-miRNA-based classifier provides a reliable prognostic model for disease recurrence in HR+HER2- breast cancer patients. This classifier may facilitate patient counseling and serve in personalized treatment for breast cancer patients.Citation Format: Chang Gong, Weige Tan, Kai Chen, Na You, Shan Zhu, Wei Luo, Xinhua Xie, Yunjie Zeng, Nengtai Ouyang, Zhihua Li, Mushen Zeng, ShiMei Zhuang, Wan-Yee Lau, Qiang Liu, Fengxi Su, Xueqin Wang, Erwei Song.

        "abstract": "T1 breast cancer patients have favorable clinical outcomes, so that whether axillary stating (AS) surgery can be omitted in these patients is still unclear. This retrospective cohort study developed a nomogram to predict the cancer-specific survival (CSS) of T1 breast cancer patients with and without AS and estimate the survival benefit of AS in these patients.We used surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database to identify 232,195 breast cancer patients with T1 tumors diagnosed between 1990 and 2008. In the training cohort, we used the Kaplan-Meier method and the competing risk analysis, with non-CSS as the competing risk, to screen for prognostic factors for CSS. A nomogram to predict the CSS, with receiving AS or not as one of the predictors, was developed and externally validated, using the C-index and calibration plots. The survival benefit of AS can be estimated by the difference of 2 predicted CSS, when the patient was considered as having and not having AS.With a median follow-up of 109 months, the CSS of the study population were 96.3%, 92.3%, and 88.5% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Significant predictors for CSS identified in the training cohort were used to develop a nomogram, which was validated internally [C-index\u200a=\u200a0.707, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.702-0.712] and externally (C-index\u200a=\u200a0.704, 95% CI 0.698-0.710). The nomogram was well calibrated. With this nomogram, AS was predicted to have less than 2% benefit of 5-, 10-, and 15-year CSS in 60.6% (140,599/232,195), 15.5% (36,074/232,195), and 8.6% (20,043/232,195) of the entire study population, respectively.The new nomogram can accurately predict the CSS of T1 breast cancer patients, and also be able to estimate the survival benefit of AS in these patients. Prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

        "abstract": "To develop polarizer functioning in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray region, the polarization performance of synthetic mica has been investigated theoretically with a simulation code using Fresnel equations and optical constants from the Henke database. The reflectance of synthetic mica crystal for s and p polarization was measured to investigate its polarization performance in a home-made synchrotron radiation soft X-ray polarimeter at beamline 3W1B, Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The reflectivity of the synthetic mica crystal at an angle of grazing incidence of 48\u00b0 was obtained from the experimental data, which is about 4.8\u00d710 -3 at 25 nm and 6.0\u00d710 -4 at 12 nm, and the linear polarizance of the X-ray reflected by the synthetic mica crystal that we measured using an analyzer-rotating method increases from 80% to 96.6% in this EUV region, while higher than 98.2% in the simulation. The result indicates that this synthetic mica crystal works as a practical polarizer in this EUV region of 12-25 nm, and also in an extensive wavelength region higher than 25 nm. \u00a9 2011 Chinese Physical Society and the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

We find that crystals KTP (KTiOPO4) (011) crystal is an ideal one among large d-spacing crystals. We propose an experimental method to measure diffraction efficiencies of crystals with synchrotron radiation source. In particular, we find that the diffraction efficiency is closely related to the source emittance.

Three measuring methods were used to obtain the layer thickness of super thin films, which are reflectance curve fitting in soft X-ray region method, Bragg diffraction equation method and reflectance Fourier transform method. The reflectance of super thin films were measured using soft X-ray of synchrotron radiation, and X-ray diffraction were also measured at the same time. Two samples, single layer of W film based on silicon substrate and bilayer of C/W film based on silicon substrate, were used to test the accuracy of the results obtained from the three methods. The single layer W film's the thicknesses measured by the three methods are (15.21 \u00b1 0.60) nm, (14.0 \u00b1 1.0) nm and (13.8 \u00b1 1.5) nm; while for the sample of bilayer C/W film, the thicknesses of W layer are (12.64 \u00b1 0.60) nm, (13 \u00b1 1.0) nm and (13.9 \u00b1 1.5) nm. It is indicated that the method of reflectance curve fitting is most accurate while Fourier transform is least. The accuracy of the layer thickness measured by the three methods depends on the accuracy of reflectance data and X-ray diffraction data.",

The beamline covers the soft X-ray energy range from 1.2\u00a0keV up to 6\u00a0keV. There are three pairs of crystals (Si (111), InSb (111), KTP(011)) for the monochromator, separately. The performance of the crystals in respect to flux, resolving power and higher orders is discussed, and some representative results from the beamline are given. The beamline is used for a variety of experiments, for example, calibration detector, measurements of optics element characteristics and soft X-ray spectroscopy (SXS).",

A polarization analysis of the final state of the transmitted radiation from the Ni film is employed to determine the Faraday rotation at the edges. The MO effect becomes resonantly enhanced at the M2,3 edges, and accordingly large values for the rotation angle \u03b2 of 1.85 0.19\u00b0 for this ferromagnetic Ni film with thickness of 31 nm are measured. Without the magnetic field, the azimuthal angles do not shift; with parallel and antiparallel magnetic field the rotation angles shift in the opposite way and they are symmetrical. The uncertainty of Faraday rotation angles mainly comes from the data fitting and the state change of the beamline when the angles are measured. \u00a9 2008 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The optical constant of tungsten film has been obtained with least square curve fitting from the data of reflectance. The results show that the result of the first and the second sample are nearly the same with previously reported data, but the third one accord with the body material almost. It is also found that as the thickness of the film decreased, the imaginary number part (absorption) increased and the real number part (dispersive) changed little. The spectral impurity and stability of the light source has significant effect on calibration.",

Four titanium samples with different thickness were used, and ratio of transmission through different samples was used to obtain the photoabsorption cross-section. The K-edge has width of 20\u00b12 eV, compared to zero in all X-ray tables based on atomic form factors. The values we got far from the edge were in good agreement with published data. Those within 300 eV of the edge were larger than published data, due to the fine structure. The uncertainty in the measurements comes mainly from uncertainty in the density and the thickness of the titanium thin films. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The method is based on the model for Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling current across the gate oxide with correction in gate voltage to account for the polysilicon-gate depletion. By fitting the model to measured data, both the gate oxide thickness and the effective poly doping are unambiguously determined. Unlike the traditional capacitance-voltage ( ) technique that overestimates thin-oxide thickness and requires large area ca- pacitor, this approach results in true physical thickness and the measurement can be performed on a standard sub-half micron transistor. The method is suitable for oxide thickness monitoring in manufacturing environments.",

The power-voltage characteristic of PV arrays operating under partial shading conditions exhibits multiple local maximum power points (LMPPs). In this paper, a new method has been presented to track the global maximum power point (GMPP) of PV. Compared with the past proposed global MPPT techniques, the method proposed in this paper has the advantages of determining whether partial shading is present, calculating the number of peaks on P-V curves, and predicting the locations of GMPP and LMPP. The new method can quickly find GMPP, and avoid much energy loss due to blind scan. The experimental results verify that the proposed method guarantees convergence to the global MPP under partial shading conditions.",

Including the major physical effects in state-of-the art MOS devices, the model describes current characteristics from subthreshold to strong inversion as well as from the linear to the saturation operating regions with a single I-V expression, and guarantees the continuities of Ids, conductances and their derivatives throughout all Vgs, Vds, and Tbs, bias conditions. Compared with the previous BSIM models, the improved model continuity enhances the convergence property of the circuit simulators. Furthermore, the model accuracy has also been enhanced by including the dependencies of geometry and bias of parasitic series resistances, narrow width, bulk charge, and DIBL effects. The new model has the extensive built-in dependencies of important dimensional and processing parameters (e.g., channel length, width, gate oxide thickness, junction depth, substrate doping concentration, etc.). It allows users to accurately describe the MOSFET characteristics over a wide range of channel lengths and widths for various technologies, and is attractive for statistical modeling. The model has been implemented in the circuit simulators such as Spectre, Hspice, SmartSpice, Spice3e2, and so on",

The results show that the result of the first and the second sample are nearly the same with previously reported data,but the third one accord with the body material almost.It is also found that as the thickness of the film decreased,the imaginary number part (absorption) increased and the real number part(dispersive)changed little.The spectral impurity and stability of the light source has significant effect on calibration.",

Although the first proof-of-principle demonstration was reported in 1997 by the Innsbruck4 and Rome groups5, long-distance teleportation has so far only been realized in fibre with lengths of hundreds of metres6, 7. An optical free-space link is highly desirable for extending the transfer distance, because of its low atmospheric absorption for certain ranges of wavelength. By following the Rome scheme5, which allows a full Bell-state measurement, we report free-space implementation of quantum teleportation over 16 km. An active feed-forward technique has been developed to enable real-time information transfer. An average fidelity of 89%, well beyond the classical limit of 2/3, is achieved. Our experiment has realized all of the non-local aspects of the original teleportation scheme and is equivalent to it up to a local unitary operation5. Our result confirms the feasibility of space-based experiments, and is an important step towards quantum-communication applications on a global scale.",

The crucial issue in quantum key distribution is its security. Unfortunately, all recent experiments are, in principle, insecure due to real-life imperfections. Here, we propose a method that can for the first time make most of those experiments secure by using essentially the same hardware. Our method is to use decoy states to detect eavesdropping attacks. As a consequence, we have the best of both worlds--enjoying unconditional security guaranteed by the fundamental laws of physics and yet dramatically surpassing even some of the best experimental performances reported in the literature.",

Compared with fibre-based demonstrations, free-space links could provide the most appealing solution for communication over much larger distances. Despite significant efforts, all realizations to date rely on stationary sites. Experimental verifications are therefore extremely crucial for applications to a typical low Earth orbit satellite. To achieve direct and full-scale verifications of our set-up, we have carried out three independent experiments with a decoy-state QKD system, and overcome all conditions. The system is operated on a moving platform (using a turntable), on a floating platform (using a hot-air balloon), and with a high-loss channel to demonstrate performances under conditions of rapid motion, attitude change, vibration, random movement of satellites, and a high-loss regime. The experiments address wide ranges of all leading parameters relevant to low Earth orbit satellites. Our results pave the way towards ground-satellite QKD and a global quantum communication network. \u00a9 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.",

Our proposal provides not only superior efficiency, but also new insights on the connection between CSS-states and bipartite graph states. We then apply our distillation schemes to the tri-partite case for three cryptographic tasks|namely, (a) conference key agreement, (b) quantum sharing of classical secrets and (c) third-man cryptography. Moreover, we construct \"prepare-and-measure\" protocols for the above three cryptographic tasks which can be implemented with the generation of only a single entangled pair at a time. This gives significant simplification over previous experimental implementations which require two entangled pairs generated simultaneously. We also study the yields of those protocols and the threshold values of the fidelity above which the protocols can function securely. Rather surprisingly, our protocols will function securely even when the initial state does not violate the standard Bell-inequalities for GHZ states.",

Verifying high-order entanglement without the restriction of system complexity is a critical need in any experiments on general entanglement. Here, we introduce a scheme to efficiently detect genuine high-order entanglement, such as states close to genuine qudit Bell, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger, and cluster states as well as multilevel multi-DOF hyperentanglement. All of them can be identified with two local measurement settings per DOF regardless of the qudit or DOF number. The proposed verifications together with further utilities such as fidelity estimation could pave the way for experiments by reducing dramatically the measurement overhead.",

A functional relation is established relating concurrence, the Peres-Horodecki criterion, and the realignment criterion. We demonstrate that our bound is exact for some mixed quantum states. The significance of our method is illustrated by giving a quantitative evaluation of entanglement for many bound entangled states, some of which fail to be identified by the usual concurrence estimation method.",

This is achieved by constructing the whole QKD system operating at 320 MHz repetition rate, and developing high-speed transmitter and receiver modules. A novel and economic way of synchronization method is designed and incorporated into the system, which allows to work at a low frequency of 40kHz and removes the use of highly precise clock. A final key rate of 15 Hz is distributed within the experimental time of 3089 seconds, by using super-conducting single photon detectors. This is longest decoy-state QKD yet demonstrated up to date. It helps to make a significant step towards practical secure communication in long-distance scope.",

Previously, data post-processing schemes based on one-way\nclassical communications were considered for use with decoy states. In this\npaper, we develop two data post-processing schemes for the decoy-state method\nusing two-way classical communications. Our numerical simulation (using\nparameters from a specific QKD experiment as an example) results show that our\nscheme is able to extend the maximal secure distance from 142km (using only\none-way classical communications with decoy states) to 181km. The second scheme\nis able to achieve a 10% greater key generation rate in the whole regime of\ndistances.",

        "abstract": "Quantum effects, besides offering substantial superiority in many tasks over classical methods, are also expected to provide interesting ways to establish secret keys between remote parties. A striking scheme called \"counterfactual quantum cryptography\" proposed by Noh [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 230501 (2009).] allows one to maintain secure key distributions, in which particles carrying secret information are seemingly not being transmitted through quantum channels. We have experimentally demonstrated, for the first time, a faithful implementation for such a scheme with an on-table realization operating at telecom wavelengths. To verify its feasibility for extension over a long distance, we have furthermore reported an illustration on a 1 km fiber. In both cases, high visibilities of more than 98% are achieved through active stabilization of interferometers. Our demonstration is crucial as a direct verification of such a remarkable application, and this procedure can become a key communication module for revealing fundamental physics through counterfactuals.",

Furthermore, an additional link in another city of 60 km fiber (up to 130 km) is seamless integrated into this network based on a trusted relay architecture. On all the links, we have implemented protocol of decoy state scheme. All of necessary electrical hardware, synchronization, feedback control, network software, execution of QKD protocols are made by tailored designing, which allow a completely automatical and stable running. Our system has been put into operation in Hefei in August 2009, and publicly demonstrated during an evaluation conference on quantum network organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences on August 29, 2009. Real-time voice telephone with one-time pad encoding between any two of the five nodes (four all-pass nodes plus one additional node through relay) is successfully established in the network within 60 km.",

The method used is based on\nthe realignment method [K. Chen and L.A. Wu, Quant. Inf. Comput. 3, 193\n(2003)]. The new separability criterion naturally generalizes the reduction\nseparability criterion introduced independently in previous work of [M.\nHorodecki and P. Horodecki, Phys. Rev. A 59, 4206 (1999)] and [N.J. Cerf, C.\nAdami and R.M. Gingrich, Phys. Rev. A 60, 898 (1999)]. In special cases, it\nrecovers the previous reduction criterion and the recent generalized partial\ntransposition criterion [K. Chen and L.A. Wu, Phys. Lett. A 306, 14 (2002)].\nThe criterion involves only simple matrix manipulations and can therefore be\neasily applied.",

        "abstract": "The heralded generation of entangled states is a long-standing goal in\nquantum information processing, because it is indispensable for a number of\nquantum protocols. Polarization entangled photon pairs are usually generated\nthrough spontaneous parametric down-conversion, but the emission is\nprobabilistic. Their applications are generally accompanied by post-selection\nand destructive photon detection. Here, we report a source of entanglement\ngenerated in an event-ready manner by conditioned detection of auxiliary\nphotons. This scheme benefits from the stable and robust properties of\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion and requires only modest experimental\nefforts. It is flexible and allows the preparation efficiency to be\nsignificantly improved by using beamsplitters with different transmission\nratios. We have achieved a fidelity better than 87% and a state preparation\nefficiency of 45% for the source. This could offer promise in essential\nphotonics-based quantum information tasks, and particularly in enabling optical\nquantum computing by reducing dramatically the computational overhead.",

        "abstract": "A precise representation for attacks can benefit the detection of malware in both accuracy and efficiency. However, it is still far from expectation to describe attacks precisely on the Android platform. In addition, new features on Android, such as communication mechanisms, introduce new challenges and difficulties for attack detection. In this paper, we propose abstract attack models to precisely capture the semantics of various Android attacks, which include the corresponding targets, involved behaviors as well as their execution dependency. Meanwhile, we construct a novel graph-based model called the inter-component communication graph (ICCG) to describe the internal control flows and inter-component communications of applications. The models take into account more communication channel with a maximized preservation of their program logics. With the guidance of the attack models, we propose a static searching approach to detect attacks hidden in ICCG. To reduce false positive rate, we introduce an additional dynamic confirmation step to check whether the detected attacks are false alarms. Experiments show that DroidEcho can detect attacks in both benchmark and real-world applications effectively and efficiently with a precision of 89.5%.",

Here, going beyond this bipartite concept, we develop a novel formalism to explore a large class of EPR steering from generic multipartite quantum systems of arbitrarily high dimensionality and degrees of freedom, such as graph states and hyperentangled systems. All of these quantum characteristics of genuine high-order EPR steering can be efficiently certified with few measurement settings in experiments. We faithfully demonstrate for the first time such generality by experimentally showing genuine four-partite EPR steering and applications to universal one-way quantum computing. Our formalism provides a new insight into the intermediate type of genuine multipartite Bell nonlocality and potential applications to quantum information tasks and experiments in the presence of untrusted measurement devices.

        "abstract": "Hypergraph states, a generalization of graph states, constitute a large class of quantum states with intriguing non-local properties and have promising applications in quantum information science and technology. In this paper, we generalize hypergraph states to qudit hypergraph states, i.e., each vertex in the generalized hypergraph (multi-hypergraph) represents a $d$-level quantum system instead of a qubit. It is shown that multi-hypergraphs and $d$-level hypergraph states have a one-to-one correspondence. We prove that if one part of a multi-hypergraph is connected with the other part, the corresponding subsystems are entangled. More generally, the structure of a multi-hypergraph reveals the entanglement property of the corresponding quantum state. Furthermore, we discuss their relationship with some well-known state classes, e.g., real equally weighted states and stabilizer states. These statesu0027 responses to the generalized $Z$ ($X$) operations and $Z$ ($X$) measurements are studied. The Bell non-locality, an important resource in fulfilling many quantum information tasks, is also investigated.",

Here we propose a one-sided MDI-QKD (1SMDI-QKD) protocol, which enjoys detection loophole-free advantage, and at the same time weakens the state preparation assumption in MDI-QKD. The 1SMDI-QKD can be regarded as a modified MDI-QKD, in which Bobu0027s encoding system is trusted, while Aliceu0027s is uncharacterized. For the practical implementation, we also provide a scheme by utilizing coherent light source with an analytical two decoy state estimation method. Simulation with realistic experimental parameters shows that the protocol has a promising performance, and thus can be applied to practical QKD applications.",

        "abstract": "The Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen (EPR) steering is a subtle intermediate correlation between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. It not only theoretically completes the whole picture of non-local effects but also practically inspires novel quantum protocols in specific scenarios. However, a verification of EPR steering is still challenging due to difficulties in bounding unsteerable correlations. In this survey, the basic framework to study the bipartite EPR steering is discussed, and general techniques to certify EPR steering correlations are reviewed.",

Methods The clinic manifestations, treatments and follow-up results of 300 cases in our hospital in recent years were retrospectively analyzed. Postnasal drip is mainly complicated with sinus nasalis and nasopharynx diseases and it often induces chronic cough and various kinds of discomforts in the pharyngeal portion. Results All cases mainly had chronic and various kinds of discomfort in the pharyngeal portion related to sinus nasalis and nasopharynx diseases. Of the total, 243 cases related to diseases in the nasal cavity and the sinus nasalis, of which rhinitis happened in 30, periodic rhinitis in 59, naso-sinusitis in 64, naso-sinusitis polypus in 77 and tumor in the nasal cavity and the sinus nasalis in 13. Also, 57 cases related to nasopharynx diseases, including 50 cases of inflammatory diseases and 7 cases of neoplastic diseases. The misdiagnosis rate was up to 78.7 percent. After anti-infective treatment, anti-allege, necessary surgeries and radiotherapies, the cough symptoms of 290 cases disappeared and of 10 cases apparently improved. During a 1-2 year follow-up, 8 cases relapsed, but the same treatment measures still had an effect. Conclusions Strengthening the knowledge of postnasal drip syndrome is an important step to diagnose, reduce the rate of misdiagnosis and guide therapy. In order to reduce the misdiagnosis rate, it is necessary to use the standard check. Also the all-round treatments according to the causes are guarantees for curative effects.",

        "abstract": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), despite being two dramatically different entities, have overlapping phenotypes. As it is easy to misdiagnose between ARVC and DCM, there is a need to establish a new differential diagnostic parameter to differentiate the two. We investigated the utility of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) for the differential diagnosis, and our study had three aims. The first was to verify the EMB high diagnostic efficacy. The second was to investigate the EMB perforation risk at the right ventricle (RV) free wall of end-stage ARVC. The third was to determine the best EMB sampling site in differential diagnosis between ARVC and DCM. Transmural tissues were sampled at six sites on the ventricular free walls and interventricular septum of recipient hearts (35 ARVCs and 35 DCMs). Participants with wall thickness <1.7 mm were included in the subgroup with high perforation risk, and the rest were included in a subgroup with low perforation risk. The best EMB sampling site was determined by the largest area under curve (AUC) among receiver operating characteristic curves. We found significant differences (P<.01) in percentages of tissue components in transmural sections between ARVC and DCM. In the subgroup with high perforation risk, there were 12 ARVCs and no DCMs, and paper-like RV walls and transmural fat replacement were their features in the cardiac enhancement computed tomography images. In the subgroup with low perforation risk, the largest AUC was on the myocardium at the ARV: AUC=0.839, cutoff=74.76%, sensitivity=73.68%, specificity=97.14%. We conclude that EMB high differential diagnostic efficacy is a meaningful fact regardless of limited sampling range, that EMB perforation risk at the RV free wall of end-stage ARVC cannot be neglected, and that the best EMB sampling site is the ARV. Among participants with low perforation risk, ARV is still recommended as an EMB sampling site with good differential diagnostic efficacy.",

The stability of candidate housekeeping genes was evaluated by geNorm and Normfinder softwares. GAPDH showed the least variation in all heart samples. Results also indicated the difference of gene expression existed in heart failure left and right ventricles. GAPDH had the highest expression stability in both heart failure and normal heart samples.

Furthermore, the bridged carbonyl group of bicyclo[3.2.1]alkanones could be easily attacked by nucleophiles to give the ring-opened cycloheptenone products or bicyclo[4.2.1]amide in excellent yields. These reactions provide rapid access to a diverse range of cyclic structures from simple starting materials or naturally occurring compounds. ",

        "abstract": "An efficient method for the synthesis of polysubstituted aziridines utilizing enynones and imines is described. This transformation is achieved through the reaction of imines with donor/donor carbene intermediates, which were generated in situ from the cyclization of enynones. Furthermore, the resulted aziridines were good 1,3-dipoles, which could be efficiently trapped by dipolarophiles to give five-membered heterocycles. The obvious advantages of wide substrate scopes, mild reaction conditions, and high atom efficiency make this system highly appealing for construction of polysubstituted aziridines, 2,5-dihydropyroles, and 1,2,4-triazolidines.",

In the past decades, the transition-metal-catalyzed nucleophilic addition of a carbonyl group to an alkyne has attracted great interest for the high reactivity, good selectivity, excellent functional-group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions. Most importantly, versatile intermediates, such as pyrylium-ion, metal-carbene, 1,3-dipole, and metal-vinyl species, make it highly attractive for both the development of synthetic methodologies and applications in the synthesis of bioactive compounds or complex naturally occurring skeletons. This review focuses on the transition-metal-catalyzed nucleophilic addition of carbonyl groups to alkynes with an emphasis on the scope and limitations, the mechanisms, and applications in organic synthesis.",

        "abstract": "An experimental test of designed [8 + 2] reaction of vinylphenylfuran and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) has been carried out, showing that the reaction gave unexpected addition products under different conditions. When the reaction was conducted under thermal conditions in toluene, expoxyphenanthrene, which was named as a [8 + 2] isomer, was generated. The scope of this reaction has been investigated in the present study. In addition, experiments and DFT calculations have been conducted to investigate how the reaction between vinylphenylfuran and DMAD took place. Surprisingly, the reaction did not involve the expected [8 + 2] intermediate, o-quinodimethane. Instead, the reaction starts from intermolecular Diels\u2013Alder reactions between DMAD and the furan moiety of vinylphenylfuran, followed by unexpected intramolecular alkene\u2013alkene coupling. This step generates a diradical species, which then undergoes [1,3]-H shift to give the experimentally observed expoxyphenanthrene. DFT calculations revealed...",

        "title": "Open-Source Change Logs",
        "abstract": "A recent editorial in Empirical Software Engineering suggested that open-source software projects offer a great deal of data that can be used for experimentation. These data not only include source code, but also artifacts such as defect reports and update logs. A common type of update log that experimenters may wish to investigate is the ChangeLog, which lists changes and the reasons for which they were made. ChangeLog files are created to support the development of software rather than for the needs of researchers, so questions need to be asked about the limitations of using them to support research. This paper presents evidence that the ChangeLog files provided at three open-source web sites were incomplete. We examined at least three ChangeLog files for each of three different open-source software products, namely, GNUJSP, GCC-g++, and Jikes. We developed a method for counting changes that ensures that, as far as possible, each individual ChangeLog entry is treated as a single change. For each ChangeLog file, we compared the actual changes in the source code to the entries in the ChangeLog file and discovered significant omissions. For example, using our change-counting method, only 35 of the 93 changes in version 1.11 of Jikes appear in the ChangeLog file\u2014that is, over 62% of the changes were not recorded there. The percentage of omissions we found ranged from 3.7 to 78.6%. These are significant omissions that should be taken into account when using ChangeLog files for research. Before using ChangeLog files as a basis for research into the development and maintenance of open-source software, experimenters should carefully check for omissions and inaccuracies.",

We used our categorization of common coupling in kernel-based software to highlight future maintenance problems. An unsafe definition is a definition of a global variable that can affect a kernel module if that definition is changed. For each operating system we determined a number of measures, including the number of global variables, the number of instances of global variables in the kernel and overall, as well as the number of unsafe definitions in the kernel and overall. We also computed the value of each our measures per kernel KLOC and per KLOC overall. For every measure and every ratio, Linux compared unfavorably with FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. Accordingly, we are concerned about the future maintainability of Linux.",

Furthermore, when building a new software product by reusing an existing component, it is important that the reusability of the reused component is not destroyed in the new product. In this paper, we use common coupling, a measure of software dependency, to represent software reusability. We have studied Darwin, an open-source operating system that was built by reusing two open-source operating systems, Mach and FreeBSD. We show that, in the course of building Darwin, much of the reusability in Mach and FreeBSD was retained, and that Darwin is therefore a good example of how to reuse software. Unfortunately, the code written specifically for Darwin is less reusable than the reused code.",

Understanding software dependency is directly related to improving software understandability, maintainability, and reusability. In this paper, we analyze the difference between component coupling and component dependency, introduce a two-parameter component coupling metric and a three-parameter component dependency metric. An important parameter in both these metrics is coupling distance, which represents the relevance of two coupled components. These metrics are applicable to layered component-based software. These metrics can be used to represent the dependencies induced by all types of software coupling. We show how to determine coupling and dependency of all scales of software components using these metrics. These metrics are then applied to Apache HTTP, an open-source web server. The study shows that coupling distance is related to the number of modifications of a component, which is an important indicator of component fault rate, stability and subsequently, component complexity.",

We examined three versions of Linux in detail: versions 1.2.0, 2.2.10, and 2.4.20. For each of those versions, w e display the common coupling induced by current within that version using a graphical notation that reflects definitions and uses. We also measured the relationship between the number of instances of current and the size of Linux. We found that the number of instances increased m uch faster than the size of the kernel but slower than the total size of the product. Furthermore, nonkernel modules were the major source of the increase of instances of global variable current. These increases were largely within nonkernel folder arch, which contains architecture-dependent source code, and in nonkernel folder drivers, which contains all the driver programs. Consequently, as more drivers are added to Linux and as more platforms are supported, problems with maintainability caused by current will be exacerbated.",

        "abstract": "Data coupling between modules, especially common coupling, has long been considered a source of concern in software design, but the issue is somewhat more complicated for products that are comprised of kernel modules together with optional nonkernel modules. This paper presents a refined categorization of common coupling based on definitions and uses between kernel and nonkernel modules and applies the categorization to a case study. Common coupling is usually avoided when possible because of the potential for introducing risky dependencies among software modules. The relative risk of these dependencies is strongly related to the specific definition-use relationships. In a previous paper, we presented results from a longitudinal analysis of multiple versions of the open-source operating system Linux. This paper applies the new common coupling categorization to version 2.4.20 of Linux, counting the number of instances of common coupling between each of the 26 kernel modules and all the other nonkernel modules. We also categorize each coupling in terms of the definition-use relationships. Results show that the Linux kernel contains a large number of common couplings of all types, raising a concern about the long-term maintainability of Linux.",

        "abstract": "An editorial in empirical software engineering suggested that open-source software projects offer a great deal of data that can be used for experimentation. These data include artifacts such as source code and defect reports. In this paper we show that sources of open-source maintenance data, such as defect-tracking systems, change logs, and source code, cannot, in general, be used for measuring maintainability. We further show that approaches such as using defect distributions and the average lag time to fix a defect can be equally unusable. We conclude that, despite the plethora of open-source maintenance data, it is extremely hard to find data for determining the maintainability of open-source software.",

        "abstract": "In a public mobile ad hoc network (MANET), users may be selfish and refuse to forward packets for other users. Therefore, an incentive mechanism must be in place. In this paper, we adopt the \"pay for service\" model of cooperation, and propose an auction-based incentive scheme (called iPass) to enable cooperative packet forwarding behavior in MANET. Each flow pays the market price of packet forwarding service to the intermediate routers. The market pricing mechanism in our scheme is based on the generalized Vickrey auction with reserve pricing. In this auction, it is incentive compatible for the users to bid their true utilities, which greatly simplifies their bidding strategy. We prove that the outcome of our scheme is efficient, and a packet forwarding action always leads to higher social welfare for the whole network. We also design a signaling protocol to implement the scheme, and show that it incurs only small storage and computational overhead at the routers. Our simulation results show that our scheme can quickly and precisely determine the market price, and that router's resource is efficiently utilized. I. INTRODUCTION A multi-hop mobile ad hoc network (MANET) consists of mobile hosts connected by wireless links. In this network, user's cooperation is usually assumed, i.e., each node agrees to forward packets for other nodes if needed. Such coopera- tive behavior does exist in military and emergency missions, however, it is not a realistic assumption in a public MANET formed by a random group of strangers. Mobile users with a small computing device usually face limited resources, such as battery, CPU and memory. In order to save these resources, they are likely to behave selfishly , for example, by refusing to forward other users' packets, and hence paralyze the whole network.",

        "abstract": "Distributed weighted fair scheduling schemes for QoS support in wireless local area networks have not yet become standard. In this paper we propose an Admission Control and Dynamic Bandwidth Management scheme that provides fairness in the absence of distributed link level weighted fair scheduling. In case distributed fair scheduling is available, our system assists it by supplying the scheduler with the weights and adjusting them dynamically as network and traffic characteristics vary. We convert the bandwidth requirement of the application into channel time requirement for the application''s flow. The Bandwidth Manager in our scheme then allots each flow a share of the channel time depending on its requirement relative to the requirements of other flows in the network. The flow controls its packet transmission rate so it only occupies the channel for a fraction of time that is equal to the channel time proportion allotted to it by the Bandwidth Manager. As the available bandwidth in the network changes and the traffic characteristics of various flows change, the channel time proportion allotted to the individual flows by the Bandwidth Manager also dynamically varies. Our experiments with the proposed scheme show that, at the cost of a very low overhead, there is a high probability that every flow in the network will receive at least its minimum requested share of the network bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is formed by a group of mobile nodes connected by wireless links. The nodes can talk to each other by direct wireless communication when they are close to each other, or by multi-hop forwarding via the intermediate nodes when they are far away. In this thesis, we focus on the flow control problem in this network. Depending on whether the routers agree to forward packets for each other, different flow control solutions are proposed. In cooperative flow control, we provide an augmentation to improve TCP performance, and discover several limitations of applying equation-based flow control to the MANET domain. Prompted by the deficiencies of these implicit flow control schemes, we design an explicit rate-based flow control scheme (called EXACT), where routers give explicit rate signals to the passing flows. Our results show that EXACT achieves better performance than the implicit flow control schemes. Therefore, we advocate using router-assisted explicit flow control, as exemplified by EXACT, in the MANET domain. Traditionally, flow control has been studied in a cooperative network environment. Such cooperative behavior is not a realistic assumption in a public MANET formed by a random group of strangers. Users in this network are likely to behave selfishly, by refusing to forward other users' packets. Under this non-cooperative environment, flow control and incentive engineering are two problems closely related to each other. To this end, we propose a joint flow control and incentive engineering scheme called iPass. iPass adopts the \u201cpay for service\u201d model of cooperation, and utilizes an auction mechanism at each router to fairly allocate bandwidth resources to the passing flows. At the same time, the auction markets give explicit rate signals to the end-hosts for flow control purpose. We show that iPass achieves several desirable system properties, such as truthful bidding of user's utility. Our simulation results also show that iPass is able to achieve the fairness and efficiency goals of flow control. Therefore, it provides an innovative and graceful solution for the flow control and incentive engineering problems in a non-cooperative MANET.",

        "abstract": "Flow control in mobile ad hoc network (MANET) must face many new challenges such as frequent re-routing and bandwidth fluctuation of wireless links. Im- plicit flow control such as AIMD performs poorly in this en- vironment, because its slow convergence of packet sending rate often cannot keep up with the dynamics of the network. In this paper, we propose an EXplicit rAte-based flow ConTrol (EXACT) framework as our solution. It relies on explicit bandwidth signaling from the routers to notify the end-hosts their allowed data sending rates. Each router computes the data rates for its current flows according to the max-min fairness criterion, and modifies the flow con- trol header of each packet to reflect this rate. As a result, this flow control scheme reacts quickly and precisely to re- routing and bandwidth fluctuation, which makes it espe- cially suitable for a dynamic MANET. On top of the EXACT rate-based flow control scheme, we also design a reliable transport layer called TCP-EXACT, which combines SACK and a safety window to guard against feedback packet loss. Our simulation results show that the EXACT flow control scheme is very effective even in a fast moving multi-hop MANET network, and is superior to the traditional AIMD algorithm in many aspects.",

        "abstract": "In many safety-critical applications of embedded systems, the system dynamics exhibits hybrid behaviors. To enable automatic analysis of these embedded systems, many analysis tools have been developed based on hybrid automata model. These tools are constructed by their own domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) but they are different in various aspects. To enable meaningful semantic interpretation of DSMLs, we propose an infrastructure for semantic anchoring that facilitates the transformational specification of DSML semantics. In the semantic anchoring infrastructure, the semantics of a DSML can be anchored to a well-defined semantic unit, which captures the operational semantics of hybrid automaton, via model transformation. The Abstract State Machine (ASM) is used as the underlying formal framework for the semantic unit. The semantics of a DSML is defined by specifying the transformation between the abstract syntax metamodel of the DSML and that of the semantic unit. The infrastructure can also enable model exchange among DSMLs while referring to the common semantic unit. Hence, hybrid automata based DSMLs can be integrated to form a meaningful tool chain by deploying this proposed infrastructure. In this paper, we demonstrate how effective the tool-chain infrastructure is by considering a practical case study involving the hybrid automata DSMLs, HyVisual and ReachLab.",

However, with sel?sh nodes in the network, multihop packet forwarding cannot take place without an incentive mechanism. In this paper, we adopt the \"pay for service\" incentive model. i.e., clients pay the relaying nodes for their packet forwarding service. Our focus in this paper is to determine a \"fair\" pricing for packet forwarding. To this end, we model the system as a market where the pricing for packet forwarding is determined by demand and supply. Depending on the network communication scenario, the market models are different. We classify the network into four different scenarios and propose different pricing mechanisms for them. Our simulation results show that the pricing mechanisms are able to guide the market into an equilibrium state quickly. We also show that maintaining communication among the relaying nodes is important for a stable market pricing.",

        "title": "Toward a semantic anchoring infrastructure for domain-specific modeling languages",
        "abstract": "Metamodeling facilitates the rapid, inexpensive development of domain-specific modeling languages (DSML-s). However, there are still challenges hindering the wide-scale industrial application of model-based design. One of these unsolved problems is the lack of a practical, effective method for the formal specification of DSML semantics. This problem has negative impact on reusability of DSML-s and analysis tools in domain specific tool chains. To address these issues, we propose a formal well founded methodology with supporting tools to anchor the semantics of DSML-s to precisely defined and validated \"semantic units\". In our methodology, each of the syntactic and semantic DSML components is defined precisely and completely. The main contribution of our approach is that it moves toward an infrastructure for DSML design that integrates formal methods with practical engineering tools. In this paper we use a mathematical model, Abstract State Machines, a common semantic framework to define the semantic domains of DSML-s.",

        "abstract": "Group communication has become increasingly im- portant in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). Current multicast routing protocols in MANET have been shown to have large over- head due to dynamic network topology. To overcome this problem, there is a recent shift towards stateless multicast in small groups (DDM (1)). DDM queries the underlying unicast routing protocol to forward data packets towards members of a multicast group. The multicast distribution tree in DDM is implicit and cannot be controlled by the upper transport and application layers. In this paper, we introduce another small group multicast scheme, based on packet encapsulation, which uses novel packet distribution tree construction algorithms for efficient data deliv- ery. The packet distribution tree is constructed explicitly with the goal of minimizing the overall bandwidth cost of the tree. The tree construction algorithms include a location-guided k-ary (LGK) tree and a location-guided Steiner (LGS) tree. Both of them uti- lize the geometric locations of the destination nodes as heuristics to compute the trees, and are accompanied by a hybrid location update mechanism to disseminate location information among a group of nodes. Our simulation results show that LGS tree has lower bandwidth cost than LGK tree when the location informa- tion of the nodes is up-to-date, and its cost is similar to that of an optimal Steiner multicast tree. When location information of the nodes is out-dated, LGK tree outperforms LGS tree due to its lower computational complexity.",

        "abstract": "Improving TCP performance has long been the focus of many research efforts in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). In this paper, we address one aspect of this endeavor: how to properly set TCP's congestion window limit (CWL) to achieve optimal performance. Past research has shown that using a small CWL improves TCP performance in certain scenarios [M. Gerla et al., Feb. 1999], [Z. Fu et al., Apr. 2003], however, no comprehensive study has been given. To this end, we turn the problem of setting TCP's optimal CWL into identifying the bandwidth-delay product (BDP) of a path in MANET. We first show and prove that, independent of the MAC layer protocol being used, the BDP of a path in MANET cannot exceed the round-trip hop-count (RTHC) of the path. We further refine this upper bound based on the IEEE 802.11 MAC layer protocol, and show that in a chain topology, a tighter upper bound exists, which is approximately 1/5 of the RTHC of the path. Based on this tighter bound, we propose an adaptive CWL setting strategy to dynamically adjust TCP's CWL according to the current RTHC of its path. Using ns-2 simulations, we show that our simple strategy improves TCP performance by 8% to 16% in a dynamic MANET environment.",

        "title": "Distributed End-to-end Proportional Delay Differentiation in Wireless LAN",
        "abstract": "Providing service differentiation in wireless net- works has attracted much attention in recent research. Existing studies so far have focused on the design of MAC layer protocols to achieve distributed priority scheduling. While these works have been shown to achieve certain differentiation (higher throughput or lower delay for higher priority packets) at MAC layer, they did not consider the problem of service differentiation from end- to-end perspective. Moreover, these approaches did not present a formalized service differentiation model that quantifies the degree of differentiation, which is critical for service class selection and provision. This paper addresses above problems by introducing a clear service differentiation model, proportional service differentiation, to the domain of wireless network which targets at providing proportional delay differentiation in wireless LAN. Due to the unique characteristic of distributed medium sharing, the scheduling algorithm employed in wireline networks can not be applied directly to the context of the wireless network. We argue that delay differentiation in wireless LAN can be only achieved through a joint packet scheduling at network layer and distributed coordination at MAC layer. Hereby, we present a distributed waiting time priority scheduling (DWTP) algorithm which is deployed on a cross-layer architecture. DWTP consists of two tiers: an intra-node predictive WTP scheduler at network layer and an inter-node priority-based distributed coordination at MAC layer. These two tiers coordinate via cross-layer priority mapping to achieve proportional delay differentiation. Simulation results show that the cross-layer DWTP algorithm can effectively achieve proportional delay differentiation in wireless LAN.",

MIC places strong emphasis on the use of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) and model transformation techniques in design flows. Metamodeling facilitates the rapid, inexpensive development of DSMLs. However, the semantics specification for DSMLs is still a hard problem. In this thesis, we propose a semantic anchoring infrastructure including a set of reusable \"semantic units\" that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine framework. A tool suite for the semantic anchoring methodology is developed to facilitate the transformational specification of DSML semantics. If the semantics of a DSML can be directly mapped onto one of the basic behavioral categories, its semantics can be defined by simply specifying the semantic anchoring rules between the DSML and a semantic unit. However, in heterogeneous systems, the semantics is not always fully captured by a predefined semantic unit. If the semantics is specified from scratch it is not only expensive but we lose the advantages of anchoring the semantics to a set of common and well-established semantic units. Therefore, we extend the semantic anchoring framework to heterogeneous behaviors by developing an approach for the composition of semantic units. The compositional semantics specification approach reduces the required effort from DSML designers and improves the quality of the specification. This thesis also includes three case studies for different purposes. The FSM domain in Ptolemy is used as a case study to explain the semantic anchoring methodology and to illustrate how the semantic anchoring tool suite is applied to design DSMLs. The Timed Automata Semantic Unit is defined as an example to illustrate how to specify semantic units. An industrial-strength modeling language, EFSM, is employed as a case study to explain the compositional semantics specification approach.",

MIC places strong emphasis on the use of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) and model transformations in design flows. Building on our earlier work on transformational specification of semantics for DSMLs, the paper proposes a \"semantic unit\" - a common semantic model - for timed automata behavior.

We show that the precise semantics of a wide range of timed automata based modeling languages (TAMLs) can be defined through specifying model transformations between a domain-specific TAML and the semantic unit.

        "title": "Effective location-guided overlay multicast in mobile ad hoc networks",
        "abstract": "Group communication has become increas- ingly important in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). Current multicast routing protocols in MANET have been shown to incur large overhead due to dynamic network topology. To overcome this problem, there is a trend towards stateless multicast. For example, DDM (1) queries the underlying unicast routing protocol to forward data packets towards members of a multicast group without keeping the multicast session state information. In this paper, we introduce another stateless multicast scheme based on packet encapsulation. Multicast packets are forwarded among the group nodes via unicast routing in an overlay fashion. To construct the overlay multicast tree, we propose several novel tree construction algorithms with the goal of minimizing the overall bandwidth cost of the tree. These algorithms include: location-guided k-ary (LGK) tree, location-guided directional (LGD) tree, and location-guided Steiner (LGS) tree. All of them rely on the geometric locations of the group nodes as heuristics to compute the tree. To augment and enhance our location- guided tree construction algorithms, we propose several companion mechanisms, including location update, address compression and route caching. Our simulation results confirm that location-guided heuristics is very effective in constructing low-cost overlay multicast trees in a MANET. When location information is up-to-date, the bandwidth cost of a LGS tree is similar to that of an optimal router-assisted Steiner multicast tree. We also discover the inherent trade-off among the proposed algorithms. Our study in this paper strongly suggests that using the Location-Guided Tree (LGT) construction algorithms, overlay multicast is an effective, efficient and practical solution for group communication in MANET.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of building high-level, class-specific feature detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a deep sparse autoencoder on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200\u00d7200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting from these learned features, we trained our network to recognize 22,000 object categories from ImageNet and achieve a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Bandwidth-delay product (BDP) and its upper bound (BDP-UB) have been well-understood in wireline networks such as the Internet. However, they have not been carefully studied in the multi-hop wireless ad hoc network (MANET) domain. In this paper, we show that the most significant difference of computing BDP and BDP-UB in MANET is the coupling of bandwidth and delay over a wireless link, where only one packet is allowed to be transmitted over the channel at a time. Based on this observation, we prove that BDP-UB of a path in MANET is upper bounded by N, where N is the number of round-trip hops of the path. We then further obtain two tighter bounds of BDP-UB, and verify them through ns-2 simulations. The understanding of BDP and BDP-UB also contributes to the solution of how to properly set TCP's congestion window limit (CWL) in MANET, in order to mitigate TCP's congestion window overshooting problem. Past studies have shown that using a small CWL improves TCP performance in certain MANET scenarios, however, no quantitative guideline has been given. In this paper, we provide a systematic solution to this problem, by dynamically applying the path's BDP-UB as TCP's CWL. Simulation results show that our solution effectively improves TCP performance in a MANET environment.",

        "title": "A Semantic Anchoring Infrastructure for the Design of Embedded Systems",
        "abstract": "Embedded systems are a key enabling technology for the recent vast increase in functionality of a huge list of critical infrastructures. Hybrid automata can be used to model system-level behaviors for the large category of systems that exhibit strong couplings between discrete and continuous dynamics. Many software tools have been developed for hybrid automata to enable model-based design of embedded systems and these software tools are constructed by using their own modeling languages. Model-based design frameworks, such as Model-Integrated Computing (MIC), Model Driven Architecture (MDA), and Model Driven Design (MDD), have been advocated to raise the level of abstraction in software tool design by placing stronger emphasis on the use of software models in the software tool design process. In particular, MIC places strong emphasis on the use of Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) and model transformations in design flows. Practical and effective development of formal specifications for DSML semantics within model-based tools can be challenging, but could positively impact adoption and reuse of these tools. The semantic anchoring methodology was developed to address this challenge by formally tying DSMLs to a \"semantic unit\u0094, which is a formal specification that captures the operational semantics of a specific model of computation. Leveraging our prior work with semantic units, we develop a semantic unit for hybrid automata. In this paper, we explicitly specify the operational semantics of hybrid automata, and develop the corresponding semantic unit and model transformation rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the infrastructure in a practical case study involving the hybrid automata DSMLs, HyVisual and ReachLab.",

        "abstract": "Flow control in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) must face many new challenges such as frequent re-routing and bandwidth variation of the wireless links. TCP's implicit AIMD flo w control performs poorly in this environment, because it often cannot keep up with the dynamics of the network. In this paper, we explore the potential utility of explicit flo w control in the MANET domain. To this end, we propose an end- to-end rate-based flo w control scheme (called EXACT), where a flo w's allowed rate is explicitly conveyed from intermediate routers to the end-hosts in each data packet's special control header. As a result, EXACT reacts quickly and precisely to re-routing and bandwidth variation, which makes it especially suitable for a dynamic MANET network. We also discuss several supporting mechanisms required for such a scheme at the MAC and the transport layers. By ns-2 simulations, we show that EXACT outperforms TCP in terms of fairness and efficiency , especially in a highly dynamic MANET environment. I. INTRODUCTION",

        "abstract": "In a public mobile ad hoc network (MANET), users may be sel.sh and refuse to forward packets for other users. Therefore, an incentive mechanism must be in place. In this paper, we adopt the \"pay for service\" model of cooperation, and propose an auction-based incentive scheme (called iPass) to enable cooperative packet forwarding behavior in MANET. Each flow pays the market price of packet forwarding service to the intermediate routers. The resource allocation mechanism in our scheme is based on the generalized Vickrey auction with reserve pricing. We prove that in our scheme, user's truthful bidding of utility remains adominant strategy, users and routers have incentive to participate in the scheme, and packet forwarding always leads to higher social welfare for the whole network. We design a signaling protocol to implement the scheme, and show that it can serve as an explicit rate-based flow control mechanism for the network. Therefore, iPass is a joint solution of incentive engineering and flow control in a non-cooperative MANET. Simulation results show that iPass is able to determine the auction outcome quickly, and at the same time achieve the goals of flow control.",

        "title": "Achieving proportional delay differentiation in wireless LAN via cross-layer scheduling",
        "abstract": "Summary Providing service differentiation in wireless networks has attracted much attention in recent research. Existing studies so far have focused on the design of differentiated media access algorithms. Some quality of service (QoS) metrics, such as queueing delay cannot be completely addressed by these approaches. Moreover, without a formalized service differentiation goal that quantifies the outcome of differentiation, the performance of most of the approaches fluctuates, especially in short time-scales. This paper addresses above problems by introducing the concept of proportional service differentiation, to the domain of wireless network and focuses on providing proportional delay differentiation in wireless LANs. Due to the unique characteristic of distributed medium sharing, the scheduling algorithm employed in wireline networks can not be applied directly to the context of wireless LANs. We argue that delay differentiation in wireless LAN can only be achieved through a joint packet scheduling at the network layer and distributed coordination at the media access control (MAC) layer. Therefore, we present a cross-layer waiting time priority (CWTP) scheduling algorithm. CWTP consists of two tiers: an intra-node waiting time priority (WTP) scheduler at the network layer and an inter-node distributed coordination function at the MAC layer. These two tiers coordinate via a mapping function, which maps the normalized waiting time at the network layer to the backoff time at the MAC layer. Two mapping schemes, namely linear mapping and piecewise linear mapping, are presented and evaluated in this paper. Extensive simulation results show that the CWTP algorithm can effectively achieve proportional delay differentiation in wireless LANs. Copyright # 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "An emerging common trend in model-based design of embedded software and systems is the adoption of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs). While abstract syntax metamodeling enables the rapid and inexpensive development of DSMLs, the specification of DSML semantics is still a hard problem. In previous work, we have developed methods and tools for the semantic anchoring of DSMLs. Semantic anchoring introduces a set of reusable \"semantic units\" that provide reference semantics for basic behavioral categories using the Abstract State Machine (ASM) framework. In this paper, we extend the semantic anchoring framework to heterogeneous behaviors by developing a method for the composition of semantic units. Semantic unit composition reduces the required effort from DSML designers and improves the quality of the specification. The proposed method is demonstrated through a case study.",

The fasting blood glucose of mice were tested 15 days later and that greater than 13.9 mmol/L were regarded as the diabetic mice which were divided randomly into the model and TFC groups. TFC dissolved by physiological saline (P.O, 80 mg/kg) was administrated to the TFC group for successive 8 weeks since the 15th day.Compared to the control group, the weight index increased significantly. The level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was markedly decreased and malondialdehyde(MDA), the inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-6) were obviously increased in myocardium. The histopathological examination suggested that myocardial cells disarranged, swelling and the intercellular space increased in model group. It also showed the infiltration of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts in TFC group. The above change was improved significantly.TFC ameliorated the alterations of cardiomyopathy in diabetic mice induced by alloxan. the mechanism might be related to decrease blood glucose, antioxidative stress and inflammatory factors.",

All rats were anaesthetized and then were killed to remove kidneys. The renal function and redox enzyme system parameters were tested. Glomerular morphology was observed by a light microscopy. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays were employed to determine the protein levels of TGF-\u03b21.TTAs attenuated the levels of urinary protein, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, although it did not significantly reduce the level of glucose. In addition, TTAs decreased the malondialdehyde while increased superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxide activities in diabetic rats. The renal pathological changes in TTAs treatment group were ameliorated. Furthermore, TTAs also ameliorated the expression of TGF-\u03b21.TTAs improved renal function via reducing oxidative stress and down-regulation the expression of TGF-\u03b21 in diabetic rats.",

        "abstract": "Trichoderma is a dominant component of the soil mycoflora. During the field investigations of northern, central, and southwestern China, three new species in the Stromaticum clade were encountered from soil, and named as T. hebeiense, T. sichuanense, and T. verticillatum. Their phylogenetic positions were determined by analyses of the combined two genes: partial sequences of translation elongation factor 1-alpha and the second largest RNA polymerase subunit-encoding genes. Distinctions between the new species and their close relatives were discussed. Trichoderma hebeiense appeared as a separate terminal branch. The species is distinctive by its oblong conidia and aggregated pustules in culture. Trichoderma sichuanense features in concentric colony and produces numerous clean exudates on aerial mycelium in culture. Trichoderma verticillatum is characterized by its verticillium-like synanamorph and production of abundant chlamydospores. In vitro antagonism towards the new species was tested by dual culture technique.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of Android malware poses great challenges to anti-malware systems because the sheer number of malware samples overwhelm malware analysis systems. A promising approach for speeding up malware analysis is to classify malware samples into families so that the common features in malwares belonging to the same family can be exploited for malware detection and inspection. However, the accuracy of existing classification solutions is limited because of two reasons. First, since the majority of Android malware is constructed by inserting malicious components into popular apps, the malwareu0027s legitimate part may misguide the classification algorithms. Second, the polymorphic variants of Android malware could evade the detection by employing transformation attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that constructs frequent subgraph (fregraph) to represent the common behaviors of malwares in the same family for familial classification of Android malware. Moreover, we propose and develop FalDroid, an automatic system for classifying Android malware according to fregraph, and apply it to 6,565 malware samples from 30 families. The experimental results show that FalDroid can correctly classify 94.5% malwares into their families using around 4.4s per app.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel systematic method on the evaluation of quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) errors from the perspective of rain-area shape verification is proposed. The method aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of conventional station-based verifications (i.e., standard skill scores), which are insensitive to the biases of station location and rain-area shape and tend to ignore the continuity of precipitation in time and space. The method develops and combines the shape verification indexes, which include the overlap ratio of a forecasted rain-area (Ratio  f  ), the overlap ratio of the ground rain-area (Ratio  t  ), the Jaccard similarity coefficient between the shape of the QPF area, the shape of the ground rain-area (Jaccard shape ), the critical success index (CSI) for the rain-area shape (CSI shape ), the probability of detection (POD) for the rain-area shape (POD shape ), and the false alarm ratio (FAR) for the rain-area shape (FAR shape ). This definition of QPF verification is applied to a rain event from 2016/08/02 00:30 to 2016/08/02 03:24 in the Guangdong Province. The decomposition of QPF errors into station-based errors and shape error components provides powerful insight into the effects of overall forecasting performance. The experimental results of this investigation show that the proposed method provides an opportunity to assess QPFs objectively and further promote advanced forecasting technologies from this perspective.",

        "abstract": "Developmentally programmed genome rearrangement accompanies differentiation of the silent germline micronucleus into the transcriptionally active somatic macronucleus in the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. Internal eliminated sequences (IES) are excised, followed by rejoining of MAC-destined sequences, while fragmentation occurs at conserved chromosome breakage sequences, generating macronuclear chromosomes. Some macronuclear chromosomes, referred to as non-maintained chromosomes (NMC), are lost soon after differentiation. Large NMC contain genes implicated in development-specific roles. One such gene encodes the domesticated piggyBac transposase TPB6, required for heterochromatin-dependent precise excision of IES residing within exons of functionally important genes. These conserved exonic IES determine alternative transcription products in the developing macronucleus; some even contain free-standing genes. Examples of precise loss of some exonic IES in the micronucleus and retention of others in the macronucleus of related species suggest an evolutionary analogy to introns. Our results reveal that germline-limited sequences can encode genes with specific expression patterns and development-related functions, which may be a recurring theme in eukaryotic organisms experiencing programmed genome rearrangement during germline to soma differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Identification of stage- and tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements will enable more precise genomic editing. In previous studies of the silkworm Bombyx mori, we identified and characterized several tissue and sex-specific cis-regulatory elements using transgenic technology, including a female- and fat body-specific promoter, vitellogenin; testis-specific promoters, Radial spoke head 1 (BmR1) and beta-tubulin 4 (Bm\u03b24). Here we reported a cis-regulatory element specific for a somatic and germ cell expressed promoter, nanos (Bmnos). We investigated activities of three truncated promoter sequences upstream of the transcriptional initiation site sequences of Bmnos in vitro (nos-0.6kb, nos-1kb, and nos-2kb, respectively) and in vivo (nos-2kb). In BmN cultured cells, all three lengths drove expression of the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), although nos-2kb had the highest fluorescence activity. In transgenic silkworms, nos-2kb drove EGFP expression at the early embryonic stage, and fluorescence was concentrated in the gonads at later embryonic stages. In addition, this cis-regulatory element was not sex difference. The fluorescence intensity gradually weakened following the larval developmental stage in the gonads and broadly express in the whole body. The nos-2kb promoter drove the Cas9 system with efficiency comparable to that of the broad-spectrum strong IE1 promoter. These results indicate that Bmnos is an effective endogenous cis-regulatory element in the early embryo and in the gonad that can be used in applications involving the CRISPR/Cas9 system.

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Similarity assessment is the fundamentally important to various remote sensing applications such as image classification, image retrieval and so on. The objective of similarity assessment is to automatically distinguish differences between images and identify the contents of an image. Unlike the existing feature-based or object-based methods, we concern more about the deep level pattern of image content. The association rule mining is capable to find out the potential patterns of image, hence in this paper, a fast association rule mining algorithm is proposed and the similarity is represented by rules. More specifically, the proposed approach consist of the following steps: firstly, the gray level of image is compressed using linear segmentation to avoid interference of details and reduce the computation amount; then the compressed gray values between pixels are collected to generate the transaction sets which are transformed into the proposed multi-dimension data cube structure; the association rules are then fast mined based on multi-dimension data cube; finally the mined rules are represented as a vector and similarity assessment is achieved by vector comparison using first order approximation of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experimental results indicate that the proposed fast association rule mining algorithm is more effective than the widely used Apriori method. The remote sensing image retrieval experiments using various images for example, QuickBird, WorldView-2, based on the existing and proposed similarity assessment show that the proposed method can provide higher retrieval precision.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Short-term precipitation commonly occurs in south part of China, which brings intensive precipitation in local region for very short time. Massive water would cause the intensive flood inside of city when precipitation amount beyond the capacity of city drainage system. Thousands people\u2019s life could be influenced by those short-term disasters and the higher city managements are required to facing these challenges. How to predict the occurrence of heavy precipitation accurately is one of the worthwhile scientific questions in meteorology. According to recent studies, the accuracy of short-term precipitation prediction based on numerical simulation model still remains low reliability, in some area where lack of local observations, the accuracy may be as low as 10%. The methodology for short term precipitation occurrence prediction still remains a challenge. In this paper, a machine learning method based on SVM was presented to predict short-term precipitation occurrence by using FY2-G satellite imagery and ground in situ observation data. The results were validated by traditional TS score which commonly used in evaluation of weather prediction. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can present overall accuracy up to 90% for one-hour to six-hour forecast. The result implies the prediction accuracy could be improved by using machine learning method combining with satellite image. This prediction model can be further used to evaluated to predicted other characteristics of weather in Shenzhen in future.",

        "abstract": "Sex is often hailed as one of the major successes in evolution, and in sexual organisms the maintenance of proper sex ratio is crucial. As a large unicellular eukaryotic lineage, ciliates exhibit tremendous variation in mating systems, especially the number of sexes and the mechanism of sex determination (SD), and yet how the populations maintain proper sex ratio is poorly understood. Here  Tetrahymena thermophila , a ciliate with seven mating types (sexes) and probabilistic SD mechanism, is analyzed from the standpoint of population genetics. It is found based on a newly developed population genetics model that there are plenty of opportunities for both the co-existence of all seven sexes and the fixation of a single sex, pending on several factors, including the strength of natural selection. To test the validity of predictions, five experimental populations of  T. thermophila  were maintained in the laboratory so that the factors that can influence the dynamics of sex ratio could be controlled and measured. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing was employed to examine the impact of newly arisen mutations. Overall, it is found that the experimental observations highly support theoretical predictions. It is expected that the newly established theoretical framework is applicable in principle to other multi-sex organisms to bring more insight into the understanding of the maintenance of multiple sexes in a natural population.",

        "abstract": "In remote sensing fusion, the spatial details of a panchromatic (PAN) image and the spectrum information of multispectral (MS) images will be transferred into fused images according to the characteristics of the human visual system. Thus, a remote sensing image fusion quality assessment called feature-based fourth-order correlation coefficient (FFOCC) is proposed. FFOCC is based on the feature-based coefficient concept. Spatial features related to spatial details of the PAN image and spectral features related to the spectrum information of MS images are first extracted from the fused image. Then, the fourth-order correlation coefficient between the spatial and spectral features is calculated and treated as the assessment result. FFOCC was then compared with existing widely used indices, such as Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthese, and quality assessed with no reference. Results of the fusion and distortion experiments indicate that the FFOCC is consistent with subjective evaluation. FFOCC significantly outperforms the other indices in evaluating fusion images that are produced by different fusion methods and that are distorted in spatial and spectral features by blurring, adding noise, and changing intensity. All the findings indicate that the proposed method is an objective and effective quality assessment for remote sensing image fusion.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we report a high performance electroluminescent (EL) device based on a green light-emitting iridium complex tris(2-(4-tolyl)phenylpyridine)iridium Ir(mppy)3 by employing another iridium(III) complex tris(phenylpyrazole)iridium Ir(ppz)3 as the sensitizer. Due to the high-lying energy levels of Ir(ppz)3, the co-doped Ir(ppz)3 molecules within the light-emitting layer function as hole trappers, which are beneficial in broadening the recombination zone and facilitating the carriersu0027 balance on the emitter molecules. In addition, the experimental results demonstrated that the co-doped Ir(ppz)3 molecules also function as the ladders of energy transfer between the host and emitter molecules. Consequently, the co-doped devices displayed a slower efficiency roll-off and higher EL efficiencies compared with those displayed by the reference device because of improved recombination probability and suppressed exciton quenching. Finally, the 0.6 wt% co-doped device with a single light-emitting layer achieved the maximum brightness, external quantum efficiency, current efficiency and power efficiency of up to 121000 cd m\u22122, 31.8%, 111.0 cd A\u22121 and 101.6 lm W\u22121, respectively. Even at a high brightness value of 10000 cd m\u22122, external quantum efficiency and current efficiency as high as 29.2% and 102.0 cd A\u22121, respectively, can still be retained.",

The calculation results indicate that the dirhodium catalyst is essential for generating a reactive Rh2\u2013nitrene intermediate having radical character; however, it is not essential for controlling final product selectivities. For substrates involving a three-membered ring, the experimentally obtained C\u2013N bond formation product is a thermodynamically favored product. In contrast, for substrates having a larger ring, the kinetically favored product is the main product. The DFT calculations presented here account for previous experimental findings, and throw light on other dirhodium-catalyzed reactions involving nitrene or carbene intermediates.",

Here we collected the genome information and comparative genomics analysis results for 10 species in the Tetrahymena genus, including the previously sequenced model organism Tetrahymena thermophila and 9 newly sequenced species, and constructed a genus-level comparative analysis platform, the Tetrahymena Comparative Genomics Database (TCGD). Genome sequences, transcriptomic data, gene models, functional annotation, ortholog groups and synteny maps were built into this database and a user-friendly interface was developed for searching, visualizing and analyzing these data.

        "abstract": "A morphospecies is defined as a taxonomic species based wholly on morphology, but often morphospecies consist of clusters of cryptic species that can be identified genetically or molecularly. The nature of the evolutionary novelty that accompanies speciation in a morphospecies is an intriguing question. Morphospecies are particularly common among ciliates, a group of unicellular eukaryotes that separates 2 kinds of nuclei-the silenced germline nucleus (micronucleus [MIC]) and the actively expressed somatic nucleus (macronucleus [MAC])-within a common cytoplasm. Because of their very similar morphologies, members of the Tetrahymena genus are considered a morphospecies. We explored the hidden genomic evolution within this genus by performing a comprehensive comparative analysis of the somatic genomes of 10 species and the germline genomes of 2 species of Tetrahymena. These species show high genetic divergence; phylogenomic analysis suggests that the genus originated about 300 million years ago (Mya). Seven universal protein domains are preferentially included among the species-specific (i.e., the youngest) Tetrahymena genes. In particular, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) genes make the largest contribution to the high level of genome divergence of the 10 species. LRR genes can be sorted into 3 different age groups. Parallel evolutionary trajectories have independently occurred among LRR genes in the different Tetrahymena species. Thousands of young LRR genes contain tandem arrays of exactly 90-bp exons. The introns separating these exons show a unique, extreme phase 2 bias, suggesting a clonal origin and successive expansions of 90-bp-exon LRR genes. Identifying LRR gene age groups allowed us to document a Tetrahymena intron length cycle. The youngest 90-bp exon LRR genes in T. thermophila are concentrated in pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions of the 5 micronuclear chromosomes, suggesting that these regions act as genome innovation centers. Copies of a Tetrahymena Long interspersed element (LINE)-like retrotransposon are very frequently found physically adjacent to 90-bp exon/intron repeat units of the youngest LRR genes. We propose that Tetrahymena species have used a massive exon-shuffling mechanism, involving unequal crossing over possibly in concert with retrotransposition, to create the unique 90-bp exon array LRR genes.",

        "abstract": "Ciliates are unicellular eukaryotes with separate germline and somatic genomes and diverse life cycles, which make them a unique model to improve our understanding of population genetics through the detection of genetic variations. However, traditional sequencing methods cannot be directly applied to ciliates because the majority are uncultivated. Single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful tool for studying genetic variation in microbes but no studies have been performed in ciliates. We compared the use of single-cell WGS and bulk DNA WGS to detect genetic variation, specifically single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in the model ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. Our analyses showed (i) Single-cell WGS has excellent performance regarding mapping rate and genome coverage but lower sequencing uniformity compared with bulk DNA WGS due to amplification bias (which was reproducible); (ii) false-positive SNP sites detected by single-cell WGS tend to occur in genomic regions with particularly high sequencing depth and high rate of C:G to T:A base changes; (iii) SNPs detected in three or more cells should be reliable (an detection efficiency of 83.4-97.4% was obtained for combined data from three cells). This analytical method could be adapted to measure genetic variation in other ciliates and broaden research into ciliate population genetics. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "The authors have discovered that vanadium disulfide (VS) nanosheets, synthesized by a hydrothermal method, exert stable peroxidase-like activity. The catalytic activity, with HO as a cosubstrate, follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics and varies with temperature, pH value and HO concentration. Two-dimensional VS sheets acting as peroxidase (POx) mimics can replace horseradish peroxidase due to their availability, robustness, and reusability. The POx-like activity of VS sheets was exploited to design a colorimetric glucose assay by using 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate and by working at an analytical wavelength of 652\u00a0nm. The assay covers the 5 to 250\u00a0\u03bcM glucose concentration range with a 1.5\u00a0\u03bcM detection limit. It was applied to the analysis of glucose in fruit juice. In our perception, the peroxidase-like nanozyme out of the family of transition metal dichalcogenides presented here has a wide scope in that it may stimulate promising biocatalytic applications in biotechnology and analytical chemistry. Graphical abstract Layered VS nanosheets were prepared via hydrothermal synthesis and are shown to exert superior peroxidase-mimicking activity. Using these POx nano-mimics, a sensitive colorimetric assay for glucose was developed and applied to fruit juice analysis. This work unlocks the access of VS to biocatalysis and bioassays.",

Herein, we proposed a novel strategy to conquer these disadvantages relying on the facet-selective response of external trigger molecule which boosts the oxidase-like catalysis of nanoceria. Results indicate that the trigger molecule (i.e., sulfate ion) prefers to bind to the rod-like nanoceria (on its unique {1\u00a01\u00a00} facets) rather than nanopolyhedra or nanocubes. Sulfate ion-treated CeO 2  nanorods (SO 4  2\u2212 /CeO 2  NRs) became modulatable oxidase mimetics of high efficiency, and the catalytic efficiency ( k cat  / K m  ) of SO 4  2\u2212 /CeO 2  NRs improved by nearly 20-fold (versus that of the naked CeO 2  NRs) for 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) oxidation. This modulating strategy, together with the mechanism behind, is finally applied to develop colorimetric biosensors, which paves the way for embedding the system in biological and environmental networks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Although the salt-adjusted properties of nanomaterials have been extensively used for colorimetric assays of all kinds of analytes, their applications in the design of fluorescence sensor are very limited. Herein, a novel fluorescence aptasensor was developed for the sensitive determination of Bisphenol S (BPS) by the salt-adjusted fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the zero-dimensional emitter (CQDs) and the two-dimensional absorber (MoS 2  nanosheets) and the roles of specific discrimination and protective effect of anti-BPS aptamer to layered MoS 2 . It is shown that layered MoS 2  can serve as a good fluorescent quencher towards carbon dots with decent quenching efficiency. Importantly, the established fluorescent method achieved satisfactory results for the determination of BPS with a good linear correlation from 0.05\u202f\u03bcM to 2\u202f\u03bcM and a detection limit of 2\u202fnM. It is expected that this method may offer a new direction for the application of the phenomenon of salt-assisted aggregation of nanomaterials in designing high-performance fluorescent biosensors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Defect WO 3 -carbon hybrid nanosheets (D-WO 3 @C), synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method, is utilized as an effective visible-light driven photocatalyst for sustainable inactivation of bacteria .  Detailed characterization through SEM-EDS, XRD, FT-IR, HRTEM, and XPS confirmed the formation of the nanohybrids. As a result, the as-synthesized D-WO 3 @C exhibited the best sterilization efficiency among all of the WO 3  photocatalysts, and 7 log inactivation of  E. coli  or  S. aureus  was obtained after treating samples for 45\u202fmin with 1000\u202f\u03bcg/mL D-WO 3 @C. It was found that D-WO 3 @C exhibited enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic sterilization in killing bacteria compared with D-WO 3  and P-WO 3 . The results show that the oxygen vacancies and carbon matrix were able to promote photocatalytic performance by triggering a faster interfacial transfer and a higher efficient separation of electron-hole pairs, which most likely is the reason behind the improved bactericidal effect. Furthermore, fluorescent-based cell viability/death tests and SEM technology were employed to demonstrate the lethal effect as well as the integrity of bacterial membranes during photocatalytic process. Photoelectrochemical techniques and UV\u2013visible diffuse reflectance revealed the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs between D-WO 3  and carbon matrix. More importantly, after being tested in four cycles, D-WO 3 @C showed good photocatalytic performance due to its chemical stability. The excellent properties associated with the novel D-WO 3 /C indicated that they could be considered as a promising light-visible driven photocatalyst to remove, in practice, microbial contamination of water.",

In this contribution, we report a state-of-art oxidase-like and ssDNA-tunable nanozyme for biomolecular recognition. In detail, the spinel-type manganese cation substituted cobalt oxide (MnCo 2 O 4 ) submicrospheres can imitate oxidase for efficiently catalytic oxidation of colorimetric substrate, superior to current metal oxide-based oxidase nanozymes. More importantly, the nanozyme activity of spinel MnCo 2 O 4  can be reversibly inhibited by the attachment/detachment of aptamer strands on MnCo 2 O 4  surface via the aptamer-target binding event, enabling a new colorimetric access for detecting biomolecules. Taking highly toxic ochratoxin A (OTA) as model molecule, we can selectively determine OTA in maize samples with a limit of detection (3\u03b4/ S ) of 0.08\u202fng/mL. The unique nanozyme property of spinel MnCo 2 O 4 , together with the principle of our approach, reveals the potential of ssDNA-tailorable oxidase nanozymes in biocatalytic and biosensing fields.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Glutathione (GSH) as a biothiol is an essential endogenous antioxidant related to various diseases. Since all the biothiols possess similar structures and reaction activities, it is still challenging to detect GSH over cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy). In this contribution, we propose a novel approach to sensitively and selectively detect GSH based on Fe 3 O 4 /MIL-88-H 2 O 2 -methylene blue (MB) heterogeneous system via enhanced Fenton-like reaction. The magnetic metal organic framework (Fe 3 O 4 /MIL-88) exhibits synergistic effect on Fenton-like reaction by combining Fe 3 O 4  with MIL-88. In this system, GSH can facilitate the degradation of MB in the presence of Fe 3 O 4 /MIL-88 and H 2 O 2 , so a detection method for GSH is established via a turn-off colorimetric process. Under the optimal conditions, this approach presents a good linear response to GSH concentration in the ranges of 0\u20130.55\u202f\u03bcM and 0.55\u20133\u202f\u03bcM, with a detection limit of 36.9\u202fnM (3 \u03b4 / S ). Furthermore, the excellent sensitive and selective responses to GSH in serum sample make this assay a promising tool for biological applications due to its simplicity, high efficiency and low cost.",

Here, with PBNPs as labels, a PBNP-based competitive lateral flow assay (LFA) for efficient and sensitive detection of clenbuterol was developed. With unique control structure, PBNPs are quite larger than most of the commonly used labels, meaning much fewer antibodies are needed in the probe to produce clearly visible results, which will bring a more sensitive dose-response relation between the analyte concentration and signal intensity. Under optimal conditions, the PBNP-based LFA showed a great linear relationship over the range of 0.5\u20135\u2009ng mL \u22121  for clenbuterol. The visual limit of detection was 1.0\u2009ng mL \u22121 , 5-fold improvement in sensitivity compared with that of the traditional gold nanoparticles based LFA. In our perception, our work opens new possibilities to choose metal organic frameworks as labeling matrices in immunoassays.",

In this paper, the temperature-gradient-aware bionic optimization (TGBO) is developed for heat source distribution problem in heat conduction. Mathematical analysis is conducted to figure out the influence of the added heat source on the temperature gradient field. Based on the analyzed result, the placement strategy of the heat sources is proposed for bionic optimization, which suggests the added heat source be located at the position with the maximum magnitude of temperature gradient. Three typical numerical cases are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method and to compare the solutions with the ones of the temperature-aware bionic optimization (TBO) in previous study. The optimized results indicate that TBO is likely to arrange the heat sources with some certain distances among each other and is more suitable for the problems with relatively symmetric boundary conditions. While for TGBO, the final solutions are likely to locate the heat sources adjacent to each other. TGBO performs better for the problems with asymmetric boundary conditions. Moreover, the total calculation of TGBO is less than the one of TBO in general, especially for the cases with symmetric boundary conditions. The influence of the initial position of the first heat source on the performance of bionic optimization method is also investigated. The results show that the first heat source is better to be placed at the position with the best heat transfer condition, which can help to improve the performance of the final solution and reduce the number of the steps during the adjusting stage. It is suggested that temperature-gradient-aware bionic optimizations is an effective method to optimize the heat source distribution for heat conduction enhancement.",

In this paper, the heat source layout optimization in two-dimensional heat conduction is investigated using simulated annealing (SA) method. Mathematical analysis is conducted to transform the heat source layout problem into a combinatorial optimization problem, which can be solved by SA. Three typical cases with various boundary conditions are introduced to validate the effectiveness of SA for heat source layout optimization. The solutions of SA are compared to the ones of random distribution (RD) and the ones of bionic optimization (BO). The results indicate that the maximum temperature of the domain can be remarkably reduced after optimizing the heat source layout using SA compared to RD. Compared to BO, it needs more computational time for SA to obtain the solution. Furthermore, the maximum temperature after optimizing by BO is lower than the ones by SA for the cases with symmetric boundary conditions. While for the case with asymmetric boundary conditions, SA performs better and the maximum temperature lower than BO is obtained. It can be concluded that simulated annealing method is effective to optimize the heat source layout problem in heat conduction.",

The numerical results show that the velocities in the cooling channels calculated by the flow resistance network model are in good agreement with the ones calculated by CFD method, validating the effectiveness of the model. Furthermore, the model can save much calculation time, which is applicable to combine with the optimization approaches for structure optimization of BTMS. Subsequently, the structure of the BTMS is optimized through arranging the widths of the inlet divergence plenum and the outlet convergence plenum without changing the layout of the battery cells. Newton method is introduced to combine with the flow resistance network model to obtain the optimal plenum widths, with the target of minimizing the standard deviation of airflow velocities in the cooling channels. The optimization with fixed inlet flow rate and the one with fixed power consumption are both conducted. Three-dimensional CFD calculations for both the original BTMS and the optimized BTMS are performed, respectively. The results show that the cooling performance of the BTMS can be improved significantly after optimization using the proposed method. For the situation with fixed inlet flow rate and constant heat generation of the battery pack, the maximum temperature difference of the battery pack is reduced by 45% after optimization. For the situation with fixed power consumption and constant heat generation of the battery pack, the maximum temperature difference of the battery pack is reduced by 41% after optimization. Moreover, the maximum temperature of the battery pack is also reduced slightly after optimization. For the situation with fixed power consumption and unsteady heat generation of the battery pack, the maximum temperature differences of the battery pack are still reduced by 35% and 32% respectively for 4C and 5C discharge processes after optimization. It can be concluded that Newton method combined with the flow resistance network model is an effective method to optimize the structure of the parallel air-cooled BTMS and to improve the cooling performance of the system.",

Among the various battery thermal management technologies, the air cooling is one of the most commonly used solutions. In this paper, the cooling performance of the parallel air-cooled BTMS is improved through using the secondary vent. Computational fluid dynamics is introduced to calculate the flow field and the temperature field, finally evaluating the cooling performance of the BTMS. Mathematical analysis is conducted to explore the influences of the inlet air temperature and the heat generation rate on the battery cell temperature. The analysis results demonstrate that the temperature rise and the temperature difference of the battery pack are independent of the inlet air temperature, and are proportional to the heat generation rate for the situation of the constant heat generation rate. Subsequently, the influences of the position and the size of the secondary vent on the cooling performance of the BTMS are investigated through using the typical numerical cases. The results show that the position of the secondary vent strongly affects the maximum temperature and the maximum temperature difference of the battery pack. When the vent is on the convergence plenum, it is suggested to be located against the cooling channel around the battery cell with the maximum temperature. Compared to the vent located on the convergence plenum, the one against the outlet performs better. In this situation, the maximum temperature of the battery pack is reduced by 5\u00a0K or more, and the maximum temperature difference is reduced by 60% or more compared to the BTMS without vent for the situation of the constant heat generation rate. Moreover, the cooling performance of the BTMS becomes better as the size of the secondary vent increased, and similar conclusion can be obtained when the heat generation rate is unsteady.",

        "abstract": "In electric vehicles, the battery pack is one of the most important components that strongly influence the system performance. The battery thermal management system (BTMS) is critical to remove the heat generated by the battery pack, which guarantees the appropriate working temperature for the battery pack. Air cooling is one of the most commonly-used solutions among various battery thermal management technologies. In this paper, the cooling performance of the parallel air-cooled BTMS is improved through choosing appropriate system parameters. The flow field and the temperature field of the system are calculated using the computational fluid dynamics method. Typical numerical cases are introduced to study the influences of the operation parameters and the structure parameters on the performance of the BTMS. The operation parameters include the discharge rate of the battery pack, the inlet air temperature and the inlet airflow rate. The structure parameters include the cell spacing and the angles of the divergence plenum and the convergence plenum. The results show that the temperature rise and the temperature difference of the batter pack are not affected by the inlet air flow temperature and are increased as the discharge rate increases. Increasing the inlet airflow rate can reduce the maximum temperature, but meanwhile significantly increase the power consumption for driving the airflow. Adopting smaller cell spacing can reduce the temperature and the temperature difference of the battery pack, but it consumes much more power. Designing the angles of the divergence plenum and the convergence plenum is an effective way to improve the performance of the BTMS without occupying more system volume. An optimization strategy is used to obtain the optimal values of the plenum angles. For the numerical cases with fixed power consumption, the maximum temperature and the maximum temperature difference at the end of the five-current discharge process for the optimized BTMS are respectively reduced by 2.1 K and 4.3 K, compared to the original system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper investigated the effect of slot-jet position on the cooling performance of the hybrid trapezoid channel and impingement module. Cooling performances of trapezoid channels with different slot-jet positions were comparatively discussed using the realizable  k -e turbulent model. Apart from the channel with  \u03b1 \u202f=\u202f0.25 (the dimensionless distance that the slot-jet deviates from the symmetry axis of trapezoid channel), both the temperature and the temperature difference (the difference between maximum temperature and minimum temperature) of the module bottom surface firstly decline and then rise with the increase of  \u03b1 . When the slot jet is at the position of  \u03b1 \u202f=\u202f1.00, the module achieves the minimum bottom temperature. While the slot jet is at the position of  \u03b1 \u202f=\u202f0.50, the module reaches the minimum bottom temperature difference. Considering the bottom temperature and bottom temperature difference, the slot-jet position  \u03b1 \u202f=\u202f0.75 is recommended in the practical application. Besides, the difference among the cooling performances of channels with different slot-jet positions gradually decreases with the increase of pump power. Furthermore, the cooling performance of the channel with  \u03b1 \u202f=\u202f0.25 is deeply affected by the pump power. At the low pump power, both bottom temperature and bottom temperature difference of the channel with  \u03b1 \u202f=\u202f0.25 are larger than that of the channel with  \u03b1 \u202f=\u202f0.00. While at the high pump power, not only is bottom temperature of the channel with  \u03b1 \u202f=\u202f0.25 lower than that of the channel with  \u03b1 \u202f=\u202f0.00, but also temperature difference of the former is smaller than that of the latter.",

Combining the large heat storage capacity of the PCM with the excellent cooling effect of heat pipe, the as-constructed heat pipe-assisted PCM based BTM is feasible and effective with a relatively longer operation time and more suitable temperature. The experimental results show that the temperature maldistribution of battery module can be influenced by heat pipes when they are activated under high discharge rates of the batteries. Moreover, with forced air convection, the highest temperature could be controlled below 50\u00a0\u00b0C even under the highest discharge rate of 5C and a more stable and lower temperature fluctuation is obtained under cycling conditions. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of further increasing air velocity (i.e., more fan power consumption) is limited when the highest temperature continues to reduce at a lower rate due to the phase transition process of PCM. These results are expected to provide insights into the design and optimization of BTM systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, the cell spacing distribution of the battery pack in the parallel air-cooled BTMS is designed to improve the cooling efficiency of the system. The flow resistance network model is used to calculate the airflow rates in the cooling channels. A modification factor is introduced to reduce the error of the model. The effectiveness of the model is verified by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation, and the CFD method is validated by the experimental air-cooled system with aluminum blocks. Combining with the improved flow resistance network model, an optimization strategy is adopted to optimize the battery cell spacings for the homogenization of the airflow rates among the cooling channels. Then an adjustment coefficient is introduced to adjust the airflow rates in the cooling channels for more uniform cell temperatures. The results of typical numerical cases indicate that the cooling efficiency of the BTMS is improved remarkably after the cell spacing optimization using the developed strategy. Compared to the original BTMS, the maximum temperature of the battery pack for the optimized BTMS is reduced by about 4.0\u202fK, and the maximum cell temperature difference is reduced by more than 69% for various inlet airflow rates. Compared to the optimized BTMS in previous study, the maximum cell temperature difference for the present optimized BTMS is reduced by more than 25% for various inlet airflow rates.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Electric vehicles with green power system are viable alternatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil energy resources. The power source such as Li-ion battery has high sensitivity to temperature, which is a challenge related to battery thermal management. Battery thermal management system plays a vital role in the high efficiency, dependability and security of these batteries. Modern commercial electric vehicles normally use liquid based battery thermal management system, which has high heat transfer efficiency with the function of cooling or heating. This paper firstly looks at the effects of temperature on the battery performance from three aspects: low temperature, high temperature and differential temperature. Then the battery management system is discussed with the main emphasis on battery modeling methods and thermal management strategies. Further, a systematic review of liquid based system is presented in terms of direct and indirect contact mode. Progress made in liquid channel configuration and heat transfer fluid aiming at improving the overall thermal performance is also discussed. With the function of liquid-gas phase change process, the heat pipe based battery thermal management is feasible and effective for its high heat transfer efficiency. To further facilitate vehicle-mounted energy optimization, an integrated vehicle thermal management system with appropriate energy allocation is required. In addition, the battery thermal management system connected with the other subsystems (e.g., heating ventilation air conditioning system) by utilizing the liquid circulation in vehicle thermal management has great potential in energy-saving and efficiency promotion.",

Various models are employed to describe the problem, including the linear wake model, the power-law power curve model with power control mechanisms, Weibull distribution, and the profit function. The incremental calculation method is developed to consider the influence of the adding turbine on other turbines in the wind farm and accelerate the wind power assessment process. The repeated adjustment strategy is used to improve the optimized result. Three cases with simple models and a case with realistic models are used to test the present method. The results show that the greedy algorithm with repeated adjustment can obtain a better result than bionic algorithm and genetic algorithm in less computational time.

This paper studies the wind turbine layout optimization with multiple hub heights wind turbines using greedy algorithm. The linear wake model and the particle wake model are used for wake flow calculation over flat terrain and complex terrain, respectively. Three-dimensional greedy algorithm is developed to optimize wind turbine layout with multiple hub heights for minimizing cost per unit power output. The numerical cases over flat terrain and complex terrain are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed greedy algorithm for the optimization problem. The results reveal that it incurs lower computational costs to obtain better optimized results using the proposed greedy algorithm than the one using genetic algorithm. Compared to the layout with identical hub height wind turbines, the one with multiple hub height wind turbines can increase the total power output and decrease the cost per unit power output remarkably, especially for the wind farm over complex terrain. It is suggested that three-dimensional greedy algorithm is an effective method for more benefits of using wind turbines with multiple hub heights in wind farm design.",

By decoupling the solving of wake flow from that of the velocity field, the proposed model treats the wake flow intensity as a kind of convective and diffusive virtual matter. The particle random walk method is utilized to simulate the motion of the virtual matter. Comparing to the existing linear model for turbine wake flow, the proposed model can predict the distributions of velocity decay and turbulence of wake flow in a non-uniform flow field above complex terrain. Experimental data from wind tunnel and real wind farm is used to validate the model, demonstrating its effectiveness on estimating the velocity decay and the turbulence intensity, and additionally, the power yield of a wind farm. The model proposed in this paper can be integrated into algorithms for numerical assessment and micro-siting optimization of wind farms on complex terrains.",

The X-ray diffraction patterns indicated the crystal phase of nanoflakes was varied from \u03b2-In2S3 to tetragonal-CuInS2 as the Cu/In molar ratio was increased. The In2S3 nanoflakes exhibited absorption band at 450 nm, while new absorption peaks in turn appeared at 550 nm and 670 nm as the Cu/In molar ratio was increased. In addition, the two-dimensional ultrathin nanoflakes exhibited intense photocurrent response.",

        "abstract": "An antenna-reactor hybrid coupling plasmonic antenna with catalytic nanoparticles is a new strategy to optimize photocatalytic activity. Herein, we have rationally proposed a Au/XS/Au (X = Re, Mo) antenna reactor, which has a large Au core as the antenna and small satellite Au nanoparticles as the reactor separated by an ultrathin two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenide XS shell (\u223c2.6 nm). Due to efficient charge transfer across the XS shell as well as energy transfer via coupling of the Au antenna and Au reactor, the photocatalytic activity has been largely enhanced: Au/ReS/Au exhibits a 3.59-fold enhancement, whereas Au/MoS/Au exhibits a 2.66-fold enhancement as compared to that of the sum of the three individual components. The different enhancement in the Au/ReS/Au and Au/MoS/Au antenna-reactor hybrid is related to the competition and cooperation of charge and energy transfer. These results indicate the great potential of the Au/XS/Au antenna-reactor hybrid for the development of highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.",

This electrode shows a superior HER and OER ratio, high current density and stable working state in electrocatalytic water splitting. Moreover, by lowering the pressure behind the GDL, we further improved the water-splitting rate (the current density was three times higher than that of a bare MoS2 diphase electrode at -0.37 V for HER and 1.62 V for OER) and stability by eliminating the appearance of bubbles, even under a current density as high as 100 mA cm-2. Our work manifests the significance of constructing a triphase system for water splitting, and the system is also available for other gas evolution reactions.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we synthesized CdS/(Au-ReS2) nanospheres that have highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production activity induced by dielectric-plasmon hybrid antenna resonance. As the diameter (D) of ReS2 nanospheres consisting of 2D nanosheets increases from 114 \u00b1 11 to 218 \u00b1 25 nm, the resonance wavelength of the ReS2 dielectric antenna is tuned from 380 to 620 nm and the hydrogen production rate for the CdS/(Au-ReS2) nanospheres increases by more than 1.85 times and reaches a value as high as 3060 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1, with a 9% weight percentage of Au. Due to the enhancements of the local electromagnetic field and excitation energy transfer by the ReS2-Au dielectric-plasmon hybrid antenna, the hydrogen production rate for the CdS/(Au-ReS2) nanospheres (D = 218 \u00b1 25 nm) is 797, 319, 105 and 12 times larger than that for pure ReS2, Au-ReS2, CdS, and CdS-ReS2, respectively. Additionally, the persistence and reusability measurements indicate a favorable stability of CdS/(Au-ReS2). These results provide a strategy to prepare a new class of dielectric-plasmon hybrid antennas consisting of 2D materials and metal nanoparticles, which have promise in applications ranging from photocatalysis to nonlinear optics.",

We report an efficient hydrothermal method for the synthesis of well-defined ceria (CeO2)-coated gold nanorods (AuNRs) by employing the original hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide as the ligands and soft-template. Importantly, the Au/CeO2 core/shell NRs have well maintained the tunable longitudinal plasmon resonance of AuNRs in the near-infrared (NIR) region. We demonstrate that this heteronanostructure can accelerate the ceria-dependent Fenton-like reaction through the plasmon-induced hot-electron injection under NIR light illumination. The generation of hot-electrons is further revealed by detecting the NIR-light-driven photocurrent of a photoelectrochemical cell based on the Au/CeO2 core/shell NRs modified electrode.",

In Au-AlGaAs hybrid nano-antennas, electric-anapole and quasi magnetic-anapole modes are observed, leading to the suppressions of electric and magnetic dipoles. Introducing gain material to AlGaAs nanodisk to increase the strength of electric quadrupole Fano resonance leads to the suppression of electric quadrupole. Then, ideal quadrupole magnetic scattering is achieved at the wavelength of total scattering cross-section dip. The increase of signal-to-noise ratio of magnetic quadrupole results in the great enhancement of near-field inside AlGaAs nanodisk. Additionally, the strong magnetic quadrupole resonance exhibits great capability for boosting second-harmonic generation by proper mode matching. These findings achieved in subwavelength geometries have important implications for functional metamaterials and nonlinear photonic nanodevices.",

The absorption spectrum of the monolayer (HA)2PbBr4 perovskite NPLs shows about 138 nm blue shift from that of 3D MAPbBr3 perovskites, which is attributed to strong quantum confinement effect. We further investigate the two-photon photoluminescence (PL) of the NPLs and measure the exciton binding energy of monolayer perovskite NPLs using linear absorption and two-photon PL excitation spectroscopy. The exciton binding energy of monolayer perovskite NPLs is about 218 meV, which is far larger than tens of meV in 3D lead halide perovskites.",

        "abstract": "We synthesize Au@WS2 hybrid nanobelts and investigate their third-order nonlinear responses mediated by a strong anti-Stokes effect. By using the femtosecond Z-scan technique and tuning the excitation photon energy (Eexc), we find the sign reversals of both nonlinear absorption coefficient \u03b2 and nonlinear refractive index \u03b3 to be around 1.60 eV, which is prominently higher than the bandgap (1.35 eV) of WS2 bulk owing to the strong anti-Stokes processes around the bandgap of the indirect semiconductors. The saturable absorption and self-defocusing of the WS2 nanobelts are significantly enhanced by the plasmon resonance of the Au nanoparticles when Eexc > 1.60 eV. But the excited state absorption assisted by the anti-Stokes processes and the self-focusing observed at Eexc < 1.60 eV are suppressed by the surface plasmon. Furthermore, by using population rate equations, we theoretically analyze the sign reversals of both \u03b2 and \u03b3 and reveal the physical mechanism of the unique nonlinear responses of the hybrids with the plasmon resonance and anti-Stokes effect. These observations enrich the understanding of the nonlinear processes and interactions between the plasmon and exciton and are helpful for developing nonlinear optical nanodevices.",

        "abstract": "The design of new functional materials with excellent hydrogen production activity under visible-light irradiation has critical significance for solving the energy crisis. A well-controlled synthesis strategy is developed to prepare an Au\u2013Pt\u2013CdS hetero-nanostructure, in which each component of Au, Pt, and CdS has direct contact with the other two materials; Pt is on the tips and a CdS layer along the sides of an Au nanotriangle (NT), which exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production under light irradiation (\u03bb u003e 420 nm). The sequential growth and surfactant-dependent deposition produce the three-component Au\u2013Pt\u2013CdS hybrids with the Au NT acting as core while Pt and CdS serve as a co-shell. Due to the presence of the Au NT cores, the Au\u2013Pt\u2013CdS nanostructures possess highly enhanced light-harvesting and strong local-electric-field enhancement. Moreover, the intimate and multi-interface contact generates multiple electron-transfer pathways (Au to CdS, CdS to Pt and Au to Pt) which guide photoexcited electrons to the co-catalyst Pt for an efficient hydrogen reduction reaction. By evaluating the hydrogen production rate when aqueous Na2SO3\u2013Na2S solution is used as sacrificial agent, the Au\u2013Pt\u2013CdS hybrid exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity that is about 2.5 and 1.4 times larger than those of CdS/Pt and Au@CdS/Pt, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Semiconductor-based photocatalytic H2 generation is a promising approach to convert solar energy, but single-component photocatalysts still suffer from low efficiency limited by the fast charge recombination. Here, we investigate the high-efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation of (MoS2\u2013CdS)/Au and (MoS2\u2013CdS)/Pt hybrids, and demonstrate the plasmon-induced electron and energy transfer as well as the co-catalytic effect of metallic nanoparticles (NPs). In these hybrids, visible-light-harvester CdS NPs as well as plasmonic Au NPs or co-catalyst Pt NPs were grown on the monolayer MoS2 nanosheets. The photocatalytic H2 generation under visible light irradiation of (MoS2\u2013CdS)/Au and (MoS2\u2013CdS)/Pt is respectively 3.2 times and 2.4 times that of MoS2\u2013CdS. Intriguingly, the co-effect of Au NPs and Pt NPs leads to the 17 times enhancement. The plasmonic Au NPs in the hybrids play multiply significant roles to increase efficiency of H2 generation: (1) enhance light-harvesting and charge separation in the MoS2\u2013CdS subunit; (2) provide multiply plasmon-mediated hot electron injection channels; (3) amplify the co-catalyst effect of Pt. The present work offers a promising approach for the rational integration of multi-component photocatalyst to improve photocatalytic performance.",

However, growing semiconductor heterojunctions with both counterparts in direct contact with the plasmonic metal nanostructures remains challenging. Herein, we report a three-step method to grow CdS\u2013Cu2\u2212xS lateral heteroshells on Au nanoparticles with all components directly connected with each other. Ag2S semi shells are initially grown on the Au nanoparticles as an interim layer, Cu2\u2212xS semi shells are then grown on the uncovered surface of the Au nanoparticles, and CdS is generated by replacing Ag2S and the Au core complex with CdS\u2013Cu2\u2212xS lateral heteroshells Au/CdS\u2013Cu2\u2212xS is finally obtained. These complexes integrate the plasmon resonances of Au in the visible region and that of Cu2\u2212xS in the near-infrared region, and therefore show improved photocatalytic activity and high photothermal efficiency. This study offers a synthetic approach to grow metal sulfides on Au nanostructures which have diverse applications in photocatalysis and photothermal therapy.",

        "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular zoonotic protozoan parasite, is possibly the most widespread parasite of warm-blooded animals and can cause serious public health problems and economic losses worldwide. TgCDPK2, a member of the T. gondii calcium-dependent protein kinase family, was recently identified as an essential regulator for viable cyst development in T. gondii. In the present study, we evaluated the protective immunity induced by DNA vaccination based on a recombinant eukaryotic plasmid, pVAX-TgCDPK2, against acute toxoplasmosis in mice. BALB/c mice were intramuscularly immunized with pVAX-TgCDPK2 plasmid and then challenged by infection with the highly virulent RH strain of T. gondii. The specific immune responses and protective efficacy against T. gondii were analyzed by cytokine and serum antibody measurements, lymphocyte proliferation assays, flow cytometric on lymphocytes and the survival time of mice after challenge. Our results showed that mice immunized with pVAX-TgCDPK2 could elicit special humoral and cellular responses, with higher levels of IgG antibody, and increased levels of Th1-type cytokines IFN-\u03b3, IL-12(p70), and CD3\u2009+\u2009CD4\u2009+\u2009CD8\u2009- and CD3\u2009+\u2009CD8\u2009+\u2009CD4\u2009- T cells, and had a prolonged survival time (14.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.32 days) compared to control mice. These results demonstrate that pVAX-TgCDPK2 is a potential vaccine candidate against acute toxoplasmosis.",

There is no information about the prevalence and genetic characterization of T. gondii in badgers (Melogale moschata) in China. Here, a total of 367 badgers were captured from different cities in Jiangxi province, Southern China. Genomic DNA was extracted from brain tissues of each badgers, and 57 (15.45%) of them were positive for T. gondii by semi-nested PCR of the B1 gene. The positive DNA samples were typed at 11 genetic markers, including 10 nuclear loci (SAG1, 5'-SAG2 and 3'-SAG2, alternative SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1) and an apicoplast locus (Apico), with multilocus polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technology. Among them, 4 were completely typed at all loci, and 2 was genotyped for 9 loci, showing that they belong to ToxoDB#9. This is the first report of prevalence and genetic characterization of T. gondii isolates from badgers in China, which contributes to broader understanding of population structure of T. gondii in China. It is important for the prevention and control of T. gondii infection in wild animals.",

The parasite's ability to invade and replicate within the host cell is dependent on many effectors, such as dense granule proteins (GRAs) released from the specialized organelle dense granules, into host cells. GRAs have emerged as important determinants of  pathogenesis. However, the functions of some GRAs remain undefined. In this study, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technique to disrupt 17  genes (, and ) in the virulent  RH strain. The CRISPR-Cas9 constructs abolished the expression of the 17  genes. Functional characterization of single \u0394 mutants was achieved  using cell-based plaque assay and egress assay, and  in BALB/c mice. Targeted deletion of these 17  genes had no significant effect neither on the  growth and egress of the mutant strains from the host cells nor on the parasite virulence in the mouse model of infection. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomics data of the 17  genes suggest that  may serve different functions in different genotypes and life cycle stages of the parasite. In sum, although these 17 GRAs might not be essential for RH strain growth  or virulence in mice, they may have roles in other strains or parasite stages, which warrants further investigations.",

        "abstract": " is an obligatory intracellular apicomplexan protozoan which can infect any warm-blooded animal and causes severe diseases in immunocompromised individuals or infants infected in utero. The survival and success of this parasite require that it colonizes the host cell, avoids host immune defenses, replicates within an appropriate niche, and exits the infected host cell to spread to neighboring non-infected cells. All of these processes depend on the parasite ability to synthesis and export secreted proteins. Amongst the secreted proteins, rhoptry organelle proteins (ROPs) are essential for the parasite invasion and host cell manipulation. Even though the functions of most ROPs have been elucidated in the less virulent  (type II), the roles of ROPs in the highly virulent type I strain remain largely un-characterized. Herein, we investigated the contributions of 15 ROPs (ROP10, ROP11, ROP15, ROP20, ROP23, ROP31, ROP32, ROP33, ROP34, ROP35, ROP36, ROP40, ROP41, ROP46, and ROP47) to the infectivity of the high virulent type I  (RH strain). Using CRISPR-Cas9, these 15 ROPs genes were successfully disrupted and the effects of gene knockout on the parasite's ability to infect cells  and BALB/c mice  were investigated. These results showed that deletions of these ROPs did not interfere with the parasite ability to grow in cultured human foreskin fibroblast cells and did not significantly alter parasite pathogenicity for BALB/c mice. Although these ROPs did not seem to be essential for the acute infectious stage of type I  in the mouse model, they might have different functions in other intermediate hosts or play different roles in other life cycle forms of this parasite due to the different expression patterns; this warrants further investigations.",

        "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii, an obligatory intracellular protozoan, can cause serious public health problems and economic losses worldwide. Two novel dense granule proteins (GRA17 and GRA23) were recently identified as T.\u00a0gondii-secreted proteins which are localized to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) and can mediate the movement of small molecules between the host cell and parasitophorous vacuole (PV). In the present study, we evaluated the protective immunity induced by DNA vaccination with genes encoding GRA17 and GRA23 against acute toxoplasmosis in mice. Eukaryotic expressing plasmids pVAX-TgGRA17 and pVAX-TgGRA23 were constructed. Then, BALB/c mice were intramuscularly immunized with pVAX-TgGRA17, pVAX-TgGRA23, or pVAX-TgGRA17\u00a0+\u00a0pVAX-TgGRA23 followed by challenge infection with the highly virulent RH strain of T.\u00a0gondii. The specific immune responses and protective efficacy against T.\u00a0gondii were examined by cytokine and serum antibody measurements, lymphocyte proliferation assays, flow cytometry of lymphocytes and the survival time after challenge. Our results showed that mice immunized with pVAX-TgGRA17, pVAX-TgGRA23, or pVAX-TgGRA17\u00a0+\u00a0pVAX-TgGRA23 induced specific humoral and cellular responses, with higher level of IgG antibody, increased levels of Th1-type cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 (p70), and CD3CD4CD8 and CD3CD8CD4 T cells, as well as prolonged survival time (9.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32 days for pVAX-TgGRA17, 10.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79 days for pVAX-TgGRA23, and 12.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.55 days for pVAX-TgGRA17\u00a0+\u00a0pVAX-TgGRA23) compared to the blank control (7.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33 days), PBS control (7.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.44 days), and pVAX I control (7.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33 days). These results demonstrated that both TgGRA17 and TgGRA23 are potential vaccine candidates, TgGRA23 has a better immunogenicity, and co-immunization of pVAX-TgGRA17 and pVAX-TgGRA23 induces better protective efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligatory intracellular apicomplexan protozoan which can infect any warm-blooded animal and causes severe diseases in immunocompromised individuals or infants infected in utero. The survival and success of this parasite require that it colonizes the host cell, avoids host immune defenses, replicates within an appropriate niche, and exits the infected host cell to spread to neighboring non-infected cells. All of these processes depend on the parasite ability to synthesis and export secreted proteins. Amongst the secreted proteins, rhoptry organelle proteins (ROPs) are essential for the parasite invasion and host cell manipulation. Even though the functions of most ROPs have been elucidated in the less virulent T. gondii (type II), the roles of ROPs in the highly virulent type I strain remain largely un-characterized. Herein, we investigated the contributions of 15 ROPs (ROP10, ROP11, ROP15, ROP20, ROP23, ROP31, ROP32, ROP33, ROP34, ROP35, ROP36, ROP40, ROP41, ROP46, and ROP47) to the infectivity of the high virulent type I T. gondii (RH strain). Using CRISPR-Cas9, these 15 ROPs genes were successfully disrupted and the effects of gene knockout (KO) on the parasite\u2019s ability to infect cells in vitro and BALB/c mice in vivo were investigated. These results showed that deletions of these ROPs did not interfere with the parasite ability to grow in cultured human foreskin fibroblast cells (HFF) and did not significantly alter parasite pathogenicity for BALB/c mice. Although these ROPs did not seem to be essential for the acute infectious stage of type I T. gondii in the mouse model, they might have different functions in other intermediate hosts or play different roles in other life cycle forms of this parasite due to the different expression patterns; this warrants further investigations.",

        "abstract": "Infection with the apicomplexan protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is an ongoing public health problem. The parasite\u2019s ability to invade and replicate within the host cell is dependent on many effectors, such as dense granule proteins (GRAs) released from the specialized organelle dense granules, into host cells. GRAs have emerged as important determinants of T. gondii pathogenesis. However, the functions of some GRAs remain undefined. In this study, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technique to disrupt 17 GRA genes (GRA11, GRA12 bis, GRA13, GRA14, GRA20, GRA21, GRA28-31, GRA33-38 and GRA40) in the virulent T. gondii RH strain. The CRISPR-Cas9 constructs abolished the expression of the 17 GRA genes. Functional characterization of single \u0394GRA mutants was achieved in vitro using cell-based plaque assay and egress assay, and in vivo in BALB/c mice. Targeted deletion of these 17 GRA genes had no significant effect neither on the in vitro growth and egress of the mutant strains from the host cells nor on the parasite virulence in the mouse model of infection. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomics data of the 17 GRA genes suggest that GRAs may serve different functions in different genotypes and life cycle stages of the parasite. In sum, although these 17 GRAs might not be essential for RH strain growth in vitro or virulence in mice, they may have roles in other strains or parasite stages, which warrants further investigations.",

A member of the T. gondii calcium-dependent protein kinases family, TgCDPK1 was recently identified as an essential regulator of exocytosis in T. gondii, and participated in direct parasite motility, host-cell invasion and egress. In the present study, the protective immunity of recombinant TgCDPK1 protein (rTgCDPK1) was evaluated against acute toxoplasmosis in mice. rTgCDPK1 were expressed and purified, BABL/c mice were intraperitoneally immunized with rTgCDPK1 and challenged with the highly virulent RH strain of T. gondii. The specific immune responses were analyzed by measuring the cytokine and serum antibody, and lymphocyte proliferation assays, flow cytometry of lymphocytes and the survival curve were employed to evaluate the protective efficacy. From the results we found that special humoral and cellular responses could be elicited in vaccine mice, and higher level of IgG antibody, and the significant increased levels of Th1-type cytokines IFN-\u03b3, IL-12 (p70), IL10 and CD3CD4CD8- and CD3CD8CD4- T cells could also be detected comparing to control mice (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). All vaccinated mice prolonged survival time (14.90\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.89 days) challenge with 1000 tachyzoites of RH, while the control mice died within 8 days. These results indicated that TgCDPK1 protein was a potential vaccine candidate against acute toxoplasmosis.",

Linkage QTL mapping and association studies are usually applied to genetically dissect related traits, which could be further facilitated by high density SNP markers and gene annotation based on reference genome to rapid identify candidate genes associated with interested traits. Here, we carried out an association study for apparent amylose content (AC), gel consistency (GC), gelatinization temperature (GT) and PC evaluated in two environments using a diverse panel of 258 accessions from 3\u2009K Rice Genome Project. Wide phenotypic variations were observed in this panel. Genome-wide association study using 22,488 high quality SNPs identified 19 QTL affecting the four traits. Combining gene-based association study and haplotype analyses plus functional annotation allowed us to shortlist nine candidate genes for four important QTL regions affecting AC, GC and GT, including two cloned genes (Wx and ALK), and seven novels. The research suggested that GWAS and gene-based association analysis followed by haplotype analysis is an effective way to detect candidate genes. The identified genes and QTL provided valuable sources for future functional characterization and genetic improvement of rice eating and cooking quality and PC.",

        "abstract": "Drought and low nitrogen are the most common abiotic stresses limiting rice productivity in the rainfed rice areas of Asia and Africa. Development and adoption of green super rice (GSR) varieties with greatly improved drought tolerance (DT) and low nitrogen tolerance (LNT) are the most efficient way to resolve this problem. In this study, using three sets of trait-specific introgression lines (ILs) in a  variety Huanghuazhan (HHZ) background, we identified nine DT-QTL and seven LNT-QTL by a segregation distortion approach and a genome-wide association study, respectively. Based on performances of DT and LNT and genotypes at the detected QTL, two ILs M79 and M387 with DT and LNT were selected for cross-making to validate the identified QTL and to develop DT and LNT rice lines by pyramiding two DT-QTL ( and  and two LNT-QTL  and ). Using four pairs of kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) SNP markers, we selected 66 F individuals with different combinations of the target DT- and LNT-QTL favorable alleles and they showed expected improvement in DT and/or LNT, which were further validated by the significant improvement in DT and/or LNT of their F progeny testing. Based on evaluation of pyramiding lines in F lines under drought, low nitrogen (LN) and normal conditions, four promising pyramiding lines having different QTL favorable alleles were selected, which showed significantly improved tolerances to drought and/or LN than HHZ and their IL parents. Our results demonstrated that trait-specific ILs could effectively connect QTL mapping and QTL pyramiding breeding, and designed QTL pyramiding (DQP) using ILs could be more effective in molecular rice breeding for complex quantitative traits.",

        "abstract": "A novel QTL cluster for appearance quality on Chr07 was identified using reciprocal introgression populations in different locations in China. Two secondary F  populations validated QTL with significant effect on appearance quality. Appearance quality (AQ) is the main determinants of market value of rice. Identification of QTL affecting AQ is the prerequisite for efficient improvement of AQ through marker-assisted selection (MAS). Two sets of reciprocal introgression lines derived from indica Minghui 63 and japonica 02428 were used to dissect the stability of QTL affecting five AQ traits, including grain length, grain width, length to width ratio, percentage of grains with chalkiness, and degree of endosperm chalkiness using 4568 bin genotype produced from 58,000 SNPs across five different environments. A total of 41 and 30 main-effect QTL were identified in MH63 and 02428 backgrounds, respectively. Among them, 9 background-independent QTL\u00a0(BI-QTL) were found. There were also 13 and 10 stable-expressed QTL (SE-QTL) across at least two environments in MH63 and 02428 backgrounds, respectively. Two important BI- and SE-QTL regions (BISERs) including BISER-I harboring qPGWC5, qDEC5, qGW5.1, and qLWR5 on chromosome 5 and BISER-II harboring qGL7, qLWR7, qPGWC7, and qDEC7 on chromosome 7 were identified. The BISER-II was newly reported and validated by two secondary F populations in the reciprocal backgrounds. Among 59 epistatic QTL (E-QTL) detected in this study, there were only four SE- but no BI-E-QTL detected in different environments, indicating that genetic background has stronger effect on AQ traits than the environmental factors, especially for percentage of grains with chalkiness (PGWC) and degree\u00a0of endosperm chalkiness (DEC) with lower heritability. BISER-I and BISER-II harboring many BI- and SE-QTL with favorable alleles from slender grain rice are much important for improvement of rice AQ by MAS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Iron and zinc are two trace elements that are essential for rice. But they are toxic at higher concentrations, leading to severe rice yield losses especially in acid soils and inland valleys. In this study, two reciprocal introgression line (IL) populations sharing the same parents were used with high-density SNP bin markers to identify QTL tolerant to iron and zinc toxicities. The results indicated that the  japonica  variety 02,428 had stronger tolerance to iron and zinc toxicities than the  indica  variety Minghui 63. Nine and ten QTL contributing to iron and zinc toxicity tolerances, respectively, were identified in the two IL populations. The favorable alleles of most QTL came from 02,428. Among them,  qFRRDW2 ,  qZRRDW3 , and  qFRSDW11  appeared to be independent of genetic background. The region C11S49\u2013C11S60 on chromosome 11 harbored QTL affecting multiple iron and zinc toxicity tolerance-related traits, indicating partial genetic overlap between the two toxicity tolerances. Our results provide essential information and materials for developing excellent rice cultivars with iron and/or zinc tolerance by marker-assisted selection (MAS).",

        "abstract": "Recurrent selection has not been extensively applied in rice breeding practices due to lack of male sterility genes. Recently, a male sterile line (named as \u2018Jiabuyu\u2019) controlled by a novel single dominant gene was found, which provides an ideal tool for rice recurrent selection breeding. Here, two different kinds of recurrent selection populations facilitated for outcrossing by the dominant male sterile line \u2018Jiabuyu\u2019 were developed, that included one population using 31 abiotic stress tolerance introgression lines with common recipient parent as founders, and the other one using 25 popular restorers lines applied in hybrid breeding as founders. After two cycles of recurrent selection through natural outcrossing, the seeds from male fertile progeny plants were screened for higher grain yield under normal irrigated, drought, and salt-stressed natural field conditions. Finally, we identified 11 promising high-yielding lines under irrigated conditions, 12 drought-tolerant and 12 salt-tolerant lines. Among them, one line gave higher grain yield across all three conditions, three lines yielded high in both irrigated and drought conditions and another three lines gave high yields in both drought and salt-stressed conditions. The present study was a commendable attempt at utilizing recurrent selection population facilitated by dominant male sterile line to improve rice complex traits, which provided valuable lessons for other rice breeders. The developed lines are promising to be rice varieties with high yield, drought and/or salinity tolerances.",

Because the different levels of economic growth, urbanization, resource endowments, etc. in different regions generate apparently different ecological responses, a better description and comparison across different regions will provide more valuable implications for ecological improvement and policymaking. In this study, seven typical bays in southeast China that are a rapid developing area were selected to quantitatively analyze the relationship between socioeconomic development and coastal environmental quality. Based on the water quality data from 2007 to 2015, the multivariate statistical method was applied to analyze the potential environmental risks and to classify the seven bays based on their environmental quality status. The possible variation trends of environmental indices were predicted based on the cross-regional panel data by Environmental Kuznets Curve. The results showed that there were significant regional differences among the seven bays, especially Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Luoyuan Bays, suffered from severer artificial disturbances than other bays, despite their different development patterns. Socioeconomic development level was significantly associated with some water quality indices (pH, DIN, PO-P); the association was roughly positive: the areas with higher GDP per capita have some worse water quality indices. In addition, the decreasing trend of pH values and the increasing trend of nutrient concentration in the seven bays will continue in the foreseeable future. In consideration of the variation trends, the limiting nutrient strategy should be implemented to mitigate the deterioration of the coastal environments.",

The heavy metal content varied from 6.72 to 25.95 mg/kg for Cu, 16.99 to 57.98 mg/kg for Pb, 73.15 to 112.25 mg/kg for Zn, 0.03 to 0.12 mg/kg for Cd, and 20.69 to 56.47 mg/kg for Cr, respectively. With respect to the Chinese sediment quality criteria, sediments in the eastern Beibu Gulf have not been significantly affected by coastal metal pollutions. The results deduced from the geoaccumulation index (I) showed that the study area has been slightly polluted by Pb, which might be caused by non-point sources. Relatively high concentrations of Cu, Pb and Cd were found around the coastal areas of Guangxi province, the Leizhou Peninsula and the northwest coast of Hainan Island, whereas the highest concentrations of Zn and Cr were found on the northwest coast of Hainan Island. Spatial distribution patterns of the heavy metals showed that bioavailable fractions of Pb were higher than in the residual fractions, while Cu and Cd concentrations in exchangeable and carbonate fractions were relatively higher than those in the bioavailable fractions. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the sampling stations could be separated into three groups with different geographical distributions. Accompanying their similar spatial distribution in the study area, significant correlation coefficients among Cu, Cd and Pb were also found, indicating that these three metals might have had similar sources. Overall, the results indicated that the distribution of these heavy metals in the surface sediments collected from the Beibu Gulf was complex.",

        "abstract": "Microplastics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated to study the influence of human activities and to find their possible relationship on the coastal environments, where the coastal areas around Xiamen are undergoing intensive processes of industrialization and urbanization in the southeast China. The abundance of microplastics in Xiamen coastal areas was 103 to 2017particles/m in surface seawater and 76 to 333 particles/kg in sediments. Concentrations of dissolved PAHs varied from 18.1 to 248ng/L in surface seawater. The abundances of microplastics from the Western Harbor in surface seawater and sediments were higher than those from other areas. Foams were dominated in surface seawater samples, however, no foams were found in sediments samples. The microscope selection and FTIR analysis suggested that polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were dominant microplastics. The cluster analysis results demonstrated that fibers and granules had the similar sources, and films had considerably correlation with all types of PAHs (3 or 4-ring PAHs and alkylated PAHs). Plastic film mulch from agriculture practice might be a potential source of microplastics in study areas. Results of our study support that river runoff, watershed area, population and urbanization rate influence the distribution of microplastics in estuarine surface water, and the prevalence of microplastic pollution calls for monitoring microplastics at a national scale.",

        "abstract": "Environmental monitoring is fundamental in assessing environmental quality and to fulfill protection and management measures with permit conditions. However, coastal environmental monitoring work faces many problems and challenges, including the fact that monitoring information cannot be linked up with evaluation, monitoring data cannot well reflect the current coastal environmental condition, and monitoring activities are limited by cost constraints. For these reasons, protection and management measures cannot be developed and implemented well by policy makers who intend to solve this issue. In this paper, Quanzhou Bay in southeastern China was selected as a case study; and the Kriging method and a geographic information system were employed to evaluate and optimize the existing monitoring network in a semienclosed bay. This study used coastal environmental monitoring data from 15 sites (including COD, DIN, and PO-P) to adequately analyze the water quality from 2009 to 2012 by applying the Trophic State Index. The monitoring network in Quanzhou Bay was evaluated and optimized, with the number of sites increased from 15 to 24, and the monitoring precision improved by 32.9%. The results demonstrated that the proposed advanced monitoring network optimization was appropriate for environmental monitoring in Quanzhou Bay. It might provide technical support for coastal management and pollutant reduction in similar areas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coastal environment has been disturbed by human activities for a long time, especially in the rapidly urbanizing and industrializing areas. Although the surrounding area has achieved great economic success in the past 30 years, Western Xiamen Bay (China) is seriously affected by pollutants and is facing increasing ecological pressure. Because of this, Xiamen was selected in 1994 as a demonstration site for implementing an integrated coastal management program, which included a series of measures for protecting the coastal environment. However, coastal environment is dynamic, complex and site-specific, and thus a scientific quantitative evaluation framework is necessary for environment quality analysis and effective coastal management. In this study, we used oceanographic knowledge together with quantitative methods (Bai-Perronu0027s structural break test) to analyze the long-term variations of water quality indices (pH, DO, COD, DIN, PO 4 -P and Oil) in Western Xiamen Bay. In addition, we compared with other coastal areas to identify the effectiveness of phosphorus-based nutrient management measures and predicted the probable variation trend in the future. The results show that in Western Xiamen Bay: (1) the concentrations of DO and Oil in seawater are effectively controlled by local coastal management measures; (2) seawater acidification will continue to worsen based on the present situation; and (3) the P-limitation treatment strategies are effective and PO 4 -P concentration starts to fall according to the multiple statistical analysis and Environmental Kuznets Curve. This paper hopes to provide an epitome of the conflicts and consolations between socioeconomic development and environmental quality in the past, and hints for coastal management in the future.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we report the first large-scale, systematic study on the security qualities of emerging push-messaging services, focusing on their app-side service integrations. We identified a set of security properties different push-messaging services (e.g., Google Cloud Messaging) need to have, and automatically verified them in different integrations using a new technique, called Seminal. Seminal is designed to extract semantic information from a service's sample code, and leverage the information to evaluate the security qualities of the service's SDKs and its integrations within different apps. Using this tool, we studied 30 leading services around the world, and scanned 35,173 apps. Our findings are astonishing: over 20% apps in Google Play and 50% apps in mainstream Chinese app markets are riddled with security-critical loopholes, putting a huge amount of sensitive user data at risk. Also, our research brought to light new types of security flaws never known before, which can be exploited to cause serious confusions among popular apps and services (e.g., Facebook, Skype, Yelp, Baidu Push). Taking advantage of such confusions, the adversary can post his content to the victim's apps in the name of trusted parties and intercept her private messages. The study highlights the serious challenges in securing push-messaging services and an urgent need for improving their security qualities.",

        "title": "Hare Hunting in the Wild Android: A Study on the Threat of Hanging Attribute References",
        "abstract": "Android is characterized by the complicated relations among its components and apps, through which one party interacts with the other (e.g., starting its activity) by referring to its attributes like package, activity, service, action names, authorities and permissions. Such relations can be easily compromised during a customization: e.g., when an app is removed to fit an Android version to a new device model, while references to the app remain inside that OS. This conflict between the decentralized, unregulated Android customization process and the interdependency among different Android components and apps leads to the pervasiveness of hanging attribute references (Hares), a type of vulnerabilities never investigated before. In our research, we show that popular Android devices are riddled with such flaws, which often have serious security implications: when an attribute (e.g., a package/authority/action name) is used on a device but the party defining it has been removed, a malicious app can fill the gap to acquire critical system capabilities, by simply disguising as the owner of the attribute. More specifically, we discovered in our research that on various Android devices, the malware can exploit their Hares to steal the user's voice notes, control the screen unlock process, replace Google Email's account settings activity and collect or even modify the user's contact without proper permissions. We further designed and implemented Harehunter, a new tool for automatic detection of Hares by comparing attributes defined with those used, and analyzing the references to undefined attributes to determine whether they have been protected (e.g., by signature checking). On the factory images for 97 most popular Android devices, Harehunter discovered 21557 likely Hare flaws, demonstrating the significant impacts of the problem. To mitigate the hazards, we further developed an app for detecting the attempts to exploit Hares on different devices and provide the guidance for avoiding this pitfall when building future systems.",

        "abstract": "On modern operating systems, applications under the same user are separated from each other, for the purpose of protecting them against malware and compromised programs. Given the complexity of today's OSes, less clear is whether such isolation is effective against different kind of cross-app resource access attacks (called XARA in our research). To better understand the problem, on the less-studied Apple platforms, we conducted a systematic security analysis on MAC OS~X and iOS. Our research leads to the discovery of a series of high-impact security weaknesses, which enable a sandboxed malicious app, approved by the Apple Stores, to gain unauthorized access to other apps' sensitive data. More specifically, we found that the inter-app interaction services, including the keychain, WebSocket and NSConnection on OS~X and URL Scheme on the MAC OS and iOS, can all be exploited by the malware to steal such confidential information as the passwords for iCloud, email and bank, and the secret token of Evernote. Further, the design of the app sandbox on OS~X was found to be vulnerable, exposing an app's private directory to the sandboxed malware that hijacks its Apple Bundle ID. As a result, sensitive user data, like the notes and user contacts under Evernote and photos under WeChat, have all been disclosed. Fundamentally, these problems are caused by the lack of app-to-app and app-to-OS authentications. To better understand their impacts, we developed a scanner that automatically analyzes the binaries of MAC OS and iOS apps to determine whether proper protection is missing in their code. Running it on hundreds of binaries, we confirmed the pervasiveness of the weaknesses among high-impact Apple apps. Since the issues may not be easily fixed, we built a simple program that detects exploit attempts on OS~X, helping protect vulnerable apps before the problems can be fully addressed.",

        "title": "Finding Unknown Malice in 10 Seconds: Mass Vetting for New Threats at the Google-Play Scale",
        "abstract": "An app market's vetting process is expected to be scalable and effective. However, today's vetting mechanisms are slow and less capable of catching new threats. In our research, we found that a more powerful solution can be found by exploiting the way Android malware is constructed and disseminated, which is typically through repackaging legitimate apps with similar malicious components. As a result, such attack payloads often stand out from those of the same repackaging origin and also show up in the apps not supposed to relate to each other. Based upon this observation, we developed a new technique, called MassVet, for vetting apps at a massive scale, without knowing what malware looks like and how it behaves. Unlike existing detection mechanisms, which often utilize heavyweight program analysis techniques, our approach simply compares a submitted app with all those already on a market, focusing on the difference between those sharing a similar UI structure (indicating a possible repackaging relation), and the commonality among those seemingly unrelated. Once public libraries and other legitimate code reuse are removed, such diff/common program components become highly suspicious. In our research, we built this \\\"Diff-Com\\\" analysis on top of an efficient similarity comparison algorithm, which maps the salient features of an app's UI structure or a method's control-flow graph to a value for a fast comparison. We implemented MassVet over a stream processing engine and evaluated it nearly 1.2 million apps from 33 app markets around the world, the scale of Google Play. Our study shows that the technique can vet an app within 10 seconds at a low false detection rate. Also, it outperformed all 54 scanners in VirusTotal (NOD32, Symantec, McAfee, etc.) in terms of detection coverage, capturing over a hundred thousand malicious apps, including over 20 likely zero-day malware and those installed millions of times. A close look at these apps brings to light intriguing new observations e.g., Google's detection strategy and malware authors' countermoves that cause the mysterious disappearance and reappearance of some Google Play apps.",

        "title": "Following Devil's Footprints: Cross-Platform Analysis of Potentially Harmful Libraries on Android and iOS.",
        "abstract": "It is reported recently that legitimate libraries are repackaged for propagating malware. An in-depth analysis of such potentially-harmful libraries (PhaLibs), however, has never been done before, due to the challenges in identifying those libraries whose code can be unavailable online (e.g., removed from the public repositories, spreading underground, etc.). Particularly, for an iOS app, the library it integrates cannot be trivially recovered from its binary code and cannot be analyzed by any publicly available anti-virus (AV) systems. In this paper, we report the first systematic study on PhaLibs across Android and iOS, based upon a key observation that many iOS libraries have Android versions that can potentially be used to understand their behaviors and the relations between the libraries on both sides. To this end, we utilize a methodology that first clusters similar packages from a large number of popular Android apps to identify libraries, and strategically analyze them using AV systems to find PhaLibs. Those libraries are then used to search for their iOS counterparts within Apple apps based upon the invariant features shared cross platforms. On each discovered iOS PhaLib, our approach further identifies its suspicious behaviors that also appear on its Android version and uses the AV system on the Android side to confirm that it is indeed potentially harmful. Running our methodology on 1.3 million Android apps and 140,000 popular iOS apps downloaded from 8 markets, we discovered 117 PhaLibs with 1008 variations on Android and 23 PhaLibs with 706 variations on iOS. Altogether, the Android PhaLibs is found to infect 6.84% of Google Play apps and the iOS libraries are embedded within thousands of iOS apps, 2.94% among those from the official Apple App Store. Looking into the behaviors of the PhaLibs, not only do we discover the recently reported suspicious iOS libraries such as mobiSage, but also their Android counterparts and 6 other back-door libraries never known before. Those libraries are found to contain risky behaviors such as reading from their host appsu0027 keychain, stealthily recording audio and video and even attempting to make phone calls. Our research shows that most Android-side harmful behaviors have been preserved on their corresponding iOS libraries, and further identifies new evidence about libraries repackaging for harmful code propagations on both sides.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the boom of the consumer IoT market, many device manufacturers, start-up companies and technology giants have jumped into the space. Unfortunately, the exciting utility and rapid marketization of IoT, come at the expense of privacy and security. Industry reports and academic work have revealed many attacks on IoT systems, resulting in privacy leakage, property loss and large-scale availability problems. To mitigate such threats, a few solutions have been proposed. However, it is still less clear what are the impacts they can have on the IoT ecosystem. In this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive study on reported attacks and defenses in the realm of IoT aiming to find out what we know, where the current studies fall short and how to move forward. To this end, we first build a toolkit that searches through massive amount of online data using semantic analysis to identify over 3000 IoT-related articles. Further, by clustering such collected data using machine learning technologies, we are able to compare academic views with the findings from industry and other sources, in an attempt to understand the gaps between them, the trend of the IoT security risks and new problems that need further attention. We systemize this process, by proposing a taxonomy for the IoT ecosystem and organizing IoT security into five problem areas. We use this taxonomy as a beacon to assess each IoT work across a number of properties we define. Our assessment reveals that relevant security and privacy problems are far from solved. We discuss how each proposed solution can be applied to a problem area and highlight their strengths, assumptions and constraints. We stress the need for a security framework for IoT vendors and discuss the trend of shifting security liability to external or centralized entities. We also identify open research problems and provide suggestions towards a secure IoT ecosystem.",

Although protection has already been put in place, little has been done to understand the security risks of navigating an app's WebView through an URL, a legitimate need for displaying the app's UI during cross-app interactions. In our research, we found that the current design of such cross-WebView navigation actually opens the door to a cross-app remote infection, allowing a remote adversary to spread malicious web content across different apps' WebView instances and acquire stealthy and persistent control of these apps. This new threat, dubbed Cross-App WebView Infection (XAWI), enables a series of multi-app, colluding attacks never thought before, with significant real world impacts. Particularly, we found that the remote adversary can collectively utilize multiple infected apps' individual capabilities to escalate his privileges on a mobile device or orchestrate a highly realistic remote Phishing attack (e.g., running a malicious script in Chrome to stealthily change Twitter's WebView to fake Twitter's own login UI). We show that the adversary can easily find such attack \"building blocks\" (popular apps whose WebViews can be redirected by another app) through an automatic fuzz, and discovered about 7.4% of the most popular apps subject to the XAWI attacks, including Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and others. Our study reveals the contention between the demand for convenient cross-WebView communication and the need for security control on the channel, and makes the first step toward building OS-level protection to safeguard this fast-growing technology.\n\n",

        "title": "Filtering for Malice Through the Data Ocean: Large-Scale PHA Install Detection at the Communication Service Provider Level.",
        "abstract": "As a key stakeholder in mobile communications, the communication service provider (CSP, including carriers and ISPs) plays a critical role in safeguarding mobile users against potentially-harmful apps (PHA), complementing the security protection at app stores. However a CSP-level scan faces an enormous challenge: hundreds of millions of apps are installed everyday; retaining their download traffic to construct their packages entails a huge burden on the CSP side, forces them to change their infrastructure and can have serious privacy and legal ramifications. To control the cost and avoid trouble, today\u2019s CSPs acquire apps from download URLs for a malware analysis. Even this step is extremely expensive and hard to meet the demand of online protection: for example, a CSP we are working with runs hundreds of machines to check the daily downloads it observes. To rise up to this challenge, we present in this paper an innovative \u201capp baleen\u201d (called Abaleen) framework for an on-line security vetting of an extremely large number of app downloads, through a high-performance, concurrent inspection of app content from the sources of the downloads. At the center of the framework is the idea of retrieving only a small amount of the content from the remote sources to identify suspicious app downloads and warn the end users, hopefully before the installation is complete. Running on 90 million download URLs recorded by our CSP partner, our screening framework achieves an unparalleled performance, with a nearly 85(times ) speed-up compared to the existing solution. This level of performance enables an online vetting for PHAs at the CSP scale: among all unique URLs used in our study, more than 95% were processed before the completion of unfettered downloads. With the CSP-level dataset, we revealed not only the surprising pervasiveness of PHAs, but also the real impact of them (over 2 million installs in merely 3 days).",

        "abstract": "Android allows developers to build apps with app installation functionality themselves with minimal restriction and support like any other functionalities. Given the critical importance of app installation, the security implications of the approach can be significant. This paper reports the first systematic study on this issue, focusing on the security guarantees of different steps of the App Installation Transaction (AIT). We demonstrate the serious consequences of leaving AIT development to individual developers: most installers (e.g., Amazon AppStore, DTIgnite, Baidu) are riddled with various security-critical loopholes, which can be exploited by attackers to silently install any apps, acquiring dangerous-level permissions or even unauthorized access to system resources. Surprisingly, vulnerabilities were found in all steps of AIT. The attacks we present, dubbed Ghost Installer Attack (GIA), are found to pose a realistic threat to Android ecosystem. Further, we developed both a user-app-level and a system-level defense that are innovative and practical.",

        "title": "Demystifying Hidden Privacy Settings in Mobile Apps",
        "abstract": "Mobile apps include privacy settings that allow their users to configure how their data should be shared. These settings, however, are often hard to locate and hard to understand by the users, even in popular apps, such as Facebook. More seriously, they are often set to share user data by default, exposing her privacy without proper consent. In this paper, we report the first systematic study on the problem, which is made possible through an in-depth analysis of user perception of the privacy settings. More specifically, we first conduct two user studies (involving nearly one thousand users) to understand privacy settings from the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective, and identify these hard-to-find settings. Then we select 14 features that uniquely characterize such hidden privacy settings and utilize a novel technique called semantics- based UI tracing to extract them from a given app. On top of these features, a classifier is trained to automatically discover the hidden privacy settings, which together with other innovations, has been implemented into a tool called Hound. Over our labeled data set, the tool achieves an accuracy of 93.54%. Further running it on 100,000 latest apps from both Google Play and third-party markets, we find that over a third (36.29%) of the privacy settings identified from these apps are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hidden\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Looking into these settings, we observe that they become hard to discover and hard to understand primarily due to the problematic categorization on the apps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 user interfaces and/or confusing descriptions. Further importantly, though more privacy options have been offered to the user over time, also discovered is the persistence of their usability issue, which becomes even more serious, e.g., originally easy-to-find settings now harder to locate. And among all such hidden privacy settings, 82.16% are set to leak user privacy by default. We provide suggestions for improving the usability of these privacy settings at the end of our study.",

        "abstract": "Two Gram-stain negative, coccoid to oval-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria (LR4T and LR4-1), isolated from the soil of a pesticide factory in Nanjing, China, were investigated for their taxonomic allocation by using a polyphasic approach. Both strains grew optimally at pH\u20097.0, 30\u2009\u00b0C and in the absence of NaCl. Both strains were positive for catalase and oxidase activities. Q-10 was the predominant respiratory ubiquinone. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and two unknown aminolipids. The major fatty acids (u003e10\u2009% of the total fatty acids) were C18:1\u03c97c/C18:1\u03c96c (summed feature 8) and C17:1 iso I/C17:1 anteiso B (summed feature 4). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed that the two isolates formed a distinct line within a clade containing the genera Chelatococcus, Bosea, Camelimonas, Salinarimonas, Psychroglaciecola, Microvirga, Methylobacterium, Albibacter, Hansschlegelia and Methylopila in the order Rhizobiales, with the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Chelatococcus asaccharovorans TE2T (94.12\u2009%), followed by Bosea thiooxidans DSM 9653T (93.25\u2009%). Strains LR4T and LR4-1 were closely related on the basis of DNA\u2013DNA reassociation and therefore represent a single novel species. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strains LR4T and LR4-1 represent a novel species of a new genus in the order Rhizobiales, for which the name Qingshengfania soli gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is LR4T (\u2009=\u2009CCTCC AB 2015036T\u2009=\u2009KCTC 42463T).",

This strain is able to degrade several commonly used chloroacetamide herbicides, such as butachlor, acetochlor and alachlor. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain Y1T is a member of the genus Sphingomonas and shows high sequence similarities with S. starnbergensis 382T (95.7\u00a0%), S. sanxanigenens NX02T (95.7\u00a0%) and S. haloaromaticamans A175T (95.3\u00a0%), and shows low (<95\u00a0%) sequence similarities to all other Sphingomonas species. Chemotaxonomic analysis revealed that strain Y1T possesses Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone, C14:0 2-OH as the major 2-hydroxy fatty acid and sym-homospermidine as the major polyamine. The main cellular fatty acids of strain Y1T were found to be C18:1 \u03c97c (38.2\u00a0%), C16:1 \u03c96c/C16:1 \u03c97c (28.5\u00a0%), C16: 0 (10.7\u00a0%) and C14:0 2-OH (14.3\u00a0%). The main polar lipids were determined to be diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingoglycolipids (SGL1-SGL3), phosphatidyl dimethylethanolamine and aminophospholipid. The DNA G+C content was found to be 66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0mol%. Based on phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic data, strain Y1T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas chloroacetimidivorans sp. nov. is proposed.

        "abstract": "\uf06e ABSTRACT: Phenylurea herbicides (PHs) are frequently detected as major water contaminants in areas where there is extensive use. In this study, Diaphorobacter sp. strain LR2014-1, which initially hydrolyzes linuron to 3,4-dichloroanaline, and Achromobacter sp. strain ANB-1, which further mineralizes the produced aniline derivatives, were isolated from a linuron-mineralizing consortium despite being present at low abundance in the community. The synergistic catabolism of linuron by the consortium containing these two strains resulted in more efficient catabolism of linuron and growth of both strains. Strain LR2014-1 harbors two evolutionary divergent hydrolases from the amidohydrolase superfamily Phh and the amidase superfamily TccA2, which functioned complementarily in the hydrolysis of various types of PHs, including linuron (N-methoxy-N-methyl-substituted), diuron, chlorotoluron and fluomethuron (N,N-dimethyl-substituted) and siduron. These findings show that a bacterial consortium can contain catabolically synergistic species for PH mineralization and one strain could harbor functionally complementary hydrolases for a broadened substrate range.",

        "abstract": "Chemical pesticides are frequently applied in modern agricultural system to ensure good harvests.However, the extensive use of chemical pesticides may easily lead to widespread environmental pollution.The control of pesticides pollutants is of great importance because they are toxic and recalcitrant.The use of microorganisms for bioremediation of pesticides-contaminated sites may prove to be a viable alternative to physical and chemical clean-up methods, because a variety of microorganisms are known to utilize pesticides as their sole carbon or energy source.Because of the various kinds of pesticide-residues present in environment, multifunctional genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) play key roles in the bioremediation of pesticides contaminated sites.However, the difficulty of the conservation of Gram negative GEMs would be an obstacle to the application of GEMs.Our previously constructed GEMs cabaple of simultaneous degrading methyl parathion and carbofuran belong to Sphingomonas genus.The genetically engineered bacterium declined quickly in liquid medium because it was easily polluted and the conservation of GEMs in liquid phase was dissatisfaction.So it is necessary to find some solid carriers which can absorb a large quantity of GEMs and keep the livingness of GEMs.Plant ash, vermiculite, mica, kieselguhr and zeolite were used as solid carriers to study the conservation of the GEMs.The maxium adsorptive amount of GEMs of every carrier was studied and it was found that plant ash had the maxium adsorptive amount of about(19.7\u00b18.78~33.1\u00b15.32)\u00d7 1010 CFU\u00b7g-1.The effect of different carriers, different inoculum amount and protection additive on the conservation were also carried out.It was found that plant ash was the best carrier.The number of GEMs in plant ash was kept above 1010 CFU\u00b7g-1 in 120 days.The GEMs conserved for 120 days could still degrade methyl parathion and carbofuran completely in 25 days in soil pot experiment, indicating that conservation had not any negative influence on the GEMs' application.It was economic to inoculate 109 CFU\u00b7g-1 plant ash GEMs for conservation and addition of protection additive to plant ash would not promote the conservation significantlly.This work will provide some useful information for the conservation and application of GEMs.",

Strain DDT-3(T) grew at temperatures ranging from 20 to 40 \u00b0C (optimum 30-37 \u00b0C) and a pH of between 5.0 and 10.0 (optimum pH 7.0-8.0). The G+C content of the total DNA was 70.1 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain DDT-3(T) showed the highest similarity to that of Pseudoxanthobacter soli CC4(T) (99.6%), followed by Kaistia dalseonensis B6-8(T) (93.3%), Kaistia soli 5YN9-8(T) (93.0%) and Amorphus orientalis YIM D10(T) (93.0%). Strain DDT-3(T) showed less than 92.6\u200a% similarity with other species of the family Xanthobacteraceae. The major cellular fatty acids of strain DDT-3(T) were C19:0 cyclo \u03c98c (42.6%), C16:0 (33.2%) and C18:1\u03c97c (10.0%). The only respiratory quinone was ubiquinone Q-10. The characteristic diamino acid of the peptidoglycan was meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major polar lipids were glycolipid, lipid, phosphatidylcholine, aminolipid, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol. The polyamine profile consisted of major amounts of putrescine (92.9%) and minor amounts of spermidine (5.0%) and spermine (2.1%). These chemotaxonomic data support the affiliation of strain DDT-3(T) with the genus Pseudoxanthobacter. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between strain DDT-3(T) and strain CC4(T) was 47.8% (reciprocal 44.3%). DNA-DNA hybridization data as well as the biochemical and physiological characteristics strongly supported the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain DDT-3(T) and strain CC4(T). Strain DDT-3(T), therefore, represents a novel species of the genus Pseudoxanthobacter, for which the name Pseudoxanthobacter liyangensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DDT-3(T) ( = KACC 16601(T) = CCTCC AB 2013167(T)).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives To characterize a novel dimethoate amidohydrolase from Sphingomonas sp. DC-6. Results A gene, dmhA, encoding the dimethoate amidohydrolase responsible for transforming dimethoate to dimethoate carboxylic acid and methylamine, was cloned from Sphingomonas sp. DC-6. Sequence analysis and molecular modeling indicate that DmhA shares 31\u201357 % amino acid sequence identities with other functionally confirmed amidohydrolase. DmhA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni\u2013NTA affinity chromatography. The purified DmhA could hydrolyze 4-acetaminophenol, dimethoate and propanil. DmhA activity was optimal at 30 \u00b0C and pH 7.5. Hg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Tween 80, Triton X-100 or SDS strongly inhibited its activity. The K m and k cat values of DmhA for dimethoate are 0.02 mM and 1.2 s\u22121, respectively. Conclusions DmhA was confirmed to be a novel dimethoate amidohydrolase which could eliminate the toxicity of dimethoate, providing a novel gene resource for the development of pesticide-degrading enzyme preparation and mechanistic study of dimethoate hydrolysis.",

        "abstract": "Key environmental factors and the mechanisms of their influence on the physicochemical habitats and macroinvertebrate communities of streams may vary among ecoregions. We studied the differences in environmental (land use and physicochemical) factors and the mechanisms of their influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages between mountain and lowland ecoregions in central China. We applied generalized linear models to identify key environmental factors that influence macroinvertebrate metrics consisting of taxa richness, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa, percentages of EPT and intolerant individuals, and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Environmental factors and macroinvertebrate metrics significantly differed between the ecoregions. Mountain streams had significantly lower nutrients and %silt, but had twice higher total taxa richness than lowland streams. Watershed land uses were key drivers that influenced the physical habitat in the mountain ecoregion and were the main drivers that influenced both physical and chemical conditions in the lowland ecoregion. Correspondingly, watershed scale land uses, as well as physical and chemical variables, explained more variance in macroinvertebrate metrics than local-scale land uses in both mountain and lowland ecoregions. The overall biological variation was explained better by watershed-scale than by reach-scale land uses, whereas the spatial scale over which land use and physicochemical variables influence streams varied across ecoregions. Our results suggest that better landscape planning should be adopted for watershed management to improve water quality and physical habitat, and thus the conservation and restoration of macroinvertebrate biodiversity.",

        "abstract": "Strain C3-5, a Gram-negative, asporogenous, rod-shaped bacterium, was isolated from a tetrabromobisphenol A contaminated soil. Growth was observed at 10-37\u00a0\u00b0C (optimum 30\u00a0\u00b0C) and at pH 5.5-9.5 (optimum pH 7.0). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain C3-5 is a member of the genus Terrimonas and exhibits high sequence similarities with Terrimonas pekingensis QH (99.0%) and Terrimonas rhizosphaerae CR94 (97.3%), and exhibits low (<97%) sequence similarities with other known Terrimonas species. Chemotaxonomic analysis revealed that strain C3-5 possesses menaquinone-7 (MK-7) as the major isoprenoid quinone and iso-C, iso-C G, iso-C 3-OH and summed feature 3 (C \u03c96c and/or C \u03c97c) as the major (>5% of total) fatty acids. The polar lipids were determined to be a lipid, glycolipid, phospholipid, phosphoaminolipid and phosphatidylethanolamine. The DNA G+C content was found to be 42.6\u00a0mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness values with the closely related strains T. pekingensis QH and T. rhizosphaerae CR94 were 25.2 and 48.5%, respectively. Based on phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic data, strain C3-5 is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Terrimonas, for which the name Terrimonas suqianensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is C3-5 (=\u00a0CCTCC AB 2017042\u00a0=\u00a0KCTC 52676).",

        "abstract": "A novel Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterial strain designated LIP-1T was isolated from the contaminated soil of a pesticide factory in Xinyi, China, was investigated for its taxonomic allocation by a polyphasic approach. Cell growth occurred at 16-37\u2009\u00b0C (optimum, 30\u2009\u00b0C), in the presence of 0-2.0\u2009% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0\u2009%) and at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 7.0). The major fatty acids of strain LIP-1T were anteiso-C15\u2009:\u20090 (50.8\u2009%), iso-C16\u2009:\u20090 (17.6\u2009%) and anteiso-C17\u2009:\u20090 (17.4\u2009%). The cell-wall peptidoglycan type was B2\u03b4 with 2,4-diaminobutyric acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified glycolipids. The major menaquinones were MK-12 and MK-11. The genomic DNA G+C content was approximately 63.8 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain LIP-1T formed a distinct clade within the radiation of the family Microbacteriaceae and had the highest sequence similarity with Microbacterium ginsengisoli Gsoil 259T (96.01\u2009%) followed by Cryobacterium arcticum SK1T (94.94\u2009%). On the basis of the phylogenetic analyses and distinct phenotypic characteristics, a new genus, namely Huakuichenia gen. nov., is proposed, harbouring the novel species Huakuichenia soli gen. nov., sp. nov. with the type strain LIP-1T (=CCTCC AB 2015422T=KCTC 39698T).",

The G\u00a0+\u00a0C content of the total DNA of strain NK8 was found to be 65.5\u00a0mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain NK8 showed high similarity to that of Aquamicrobium aerolatum Sa14 (97.3%), followed by Aquamicrobium lusatiense S1 (96.7%) and Mesorhizobium sangali SCAU7 (96.6%). The DNA-DNA relatedness between strain NK8 and A. aerolatum Sa14 was 35.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9%. The major fatty acids of strain NK8 were determined to be C cyclo \u03c98c (45.6%), C \u03c97c (33.4%) and C (8.4%). The respiratory quinone was found to be ubiquinone Q-10. The major polyamine was found to be spermidine. The polar lipid profile include the major compounds phosphatidylcholine and diphosphatidylglycerol, and moderate amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, aminolipid and phospholipid. Based on the differential biochemical and physiological characteristics, the geno-, chemo- and phenotypic characteristics, strain NK8 is proposed to represent a novel species of the genus Aquamicrobium, Aquamicrobium soli sp. nov.

        "abstract": "Comamonas plasmids play important roles in shaping the phenotypes of their hosts and the adaptation of these hosts to changing environments, and understanding the evolutionary strategy of these plasmids is thus of great concern. In this study, the sequence of the 119-kb 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile-catabolizing plasmid pBHB from Comamonas sp. strain 7D-2 was studied and compared with those of three other Comamonas haloaromatic catabolic plasmids. Incompatibility group determination based on a phylogenetic analysis of 24 backbone gene proteins, as well as TrfA, revealed that these four plasmids all belong to the IncP-1\u03b2 subgroup. Comparison of the four plasmids revealed a conserved backbone region and diverse genetic-load regions. The four plasmids share a core genome consisting of 40 genes (u003e50% similarities) and contain 12 to 50 unique genes each, most of which are xenobiotic-catabolic genes. Two functional reductive dehalogenase gene clusters are specifically located on pBHB, showing distinctive evolution of pBHB for haloaromatics. The higher catabolic ability of the bhbA2B2 cluster than the bhbAB cluster may be due to the transcription levels and the character of the dehalogenase gene itself rather than that of its extracytoplasmic binding receptor gene. The plasmid pBHB is riddled with transposons and insertion sequence (IS) elements, and ISs play important roles in the evolution of pBHB. The analysis of the origin of the bhb genes on pBHB suggested that these accessory genes evolved independently. Our work provides insights into the evolutionary strategies of Comamonas plasmids, especially into the adaptation mechanism employed by pBHB for haloaromatics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Multimetric indices (MMIs) are widely used for assessing ecosystem condition and they have been developed for a variety of biological assemblages. However, when multiple assemblages are assessed at sites, the assessment results may differ because of differing physiological sensitivities to particular stressor gradients, different organism size and guilds, and the effects of different scales of disturbances on the assemblages. Those differences create problems for managers seeking to avoid type-1 and type-2 statistical errors. To alleviate those problems, we used an anthropogenic disturbance index for selecting and weighting metrics, modeled metrics against natural variability to reduce the natural variability in metrics, and developed an MMI based on both fish and aquatic insect metrics. We evaluated eight different ways of calibrating and combining candidate metrics and found that MMIs with unweighted and modeled aquatic insect and fish metrics were the preferred MMI options.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Elucidating the effects of asymmetric warming during winter and spring will help develop a feasible crop management strategy for climate change. Field experiments were conducted using the Yangmai-13 (vernal type) and Yannong-19 (semi-winter type) winter wheat cultivars to investigate the effects of night-warming during winter (warming by 1.47\u20131.53\u202f\u00b0C from tillering to jointing), spring (warming by 1.68\u20131.77\u202f\u00b0C from jointing to booting), and winter\u202f+\u202fspring (warming by 1.53\u20131.60\u202f\u00b0C from tillering to booting) on plant growth and N utilization in 2014\u20132016. The results showed that the grain yield, N agronomic efficiency (NAE), and N recovery efficiency (NRE) of both cultivars were highly increased in response to night-warming, which were associated with enhanced dry matter and N accumulation, and winter\u202f+\u202fspring night-warming resulted in greater increases than winter night-warming and spring night-warming. Furthermore, the increase in pre-anthesis N accumulation was much higher than after anthesis, resulting in a greater increase in post-anthesis dry matter accumulation due to more leaf N distribution at anthesis to support photosynthetic production. Root growth characteristics (i.e., root length, surface area and volume, and root bleeding intensity) were significantly promoted, which favored plant N uptake. Soil urease and protease activity as well as the net N mineralization rate, which are involved in soil N supply capacity, were increased, whereas soil inorganic N content and apparent N surplus were clearly decreased, which indicated that plant N uptake capacity was highly improved in response to night-warming conditions. In conclusion, winter and spring night-warming improve pre-anthesis root growth and N uptake ability to promote plant growth, resulting in increased N utilization efficiency with reduced N fertilizer loss, and winter\u202f+\u202fspring night-warming has more advantages for N uptake and utilization of winter wheat.",

        "abstract": "Taxonomic-based multimetric indices (MMIs) have been widely employed for assessing ecosystem status, particularly through the use of stream macroinvertebrate assemblages. However, the functional diversity and composition of assemblages is also important for maintaining stream ecosystem condition. Nonetheless, aquatic insect functional diversity and composition have not commonly been included in MMIs. Our goal was to advance our understanding of the performance and ecological interpretation of an MMI that potentially combined functional and taxonomic metrics. We sampled aquatic insects and natural and land-use variables at 74 temperate Chinese streams. We selected a candidate set of 36 functional and 20 taxonomic metrics that were screened by range tests, natural variation, responsiveness to anthropogenic disturbance, and redundancy for subsequent inclusion in MMIs. We determined if natural variation adjustments improved the performance of a functional-taxonomic MMI. Finally, we evaluated the degree to which the functional-taxonomic MMI served as an early-warning indicator of land use intensity. Natural variation explained between 19.62% and 71.02% of metric variability, indicating that functional metrics changed systematically along natural gradients. The final functional-taxonomic MMI adjusted for natural variation incorporated multiple aspects of assemblage characteristics: functional richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, abundance-weighted frequency of soft bodies, abundance-weighted frequency of predators, and number of Diptera taxa. In contrast to the natural variation unadjusted MMI, the functional-taxonomic adjusted MMI clearly distinguished least-disturbed sites from most-disturbed sites, exhibited high precision and low bias, and showed a significant negative response to land uses. The slope of a linear regression relative to 0-10% urban and 0-20% agriculture was significantly steeper for the functional-taxonomic adjusted MMI than that of the taxonomic adjusted MMI. We conclude that functional-taxonomic adjusted MMIs are more effective indicators of ecological condition and risks to biota from human pressures than are purely taxonomic unadjusted MMIs because functional-taxonomic MMIs are more sensitive to subtle anthropogenic pressures.",

        "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous malignancy. Despite the advances in past decades, the clinical outcomes of AML patients remain poor. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) is the major cause of the recurrence of AML even after aggressive treatment making, promoting development of LSC-targeted agents is an urgent clinical need. Although the antitumor activity of disulfiram (DS), an approved anti-alcoholism drug, has been demonstrated in multiple types of tumors including hematological malignancies such as AML, it remains unknown whether this agent would also be able to target cancer stem cells like LSCs. Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo activity of DS in combination with copper (Cu) against CD34/CD38 leukemia stem-like cells sorted from KG1\u03b1 and Kasumi-1 AML cell lines, as well as primary CD34 AML samples. DS plus Cu (DS/Cu) displayed marked inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and suppression of colony formation in cultured AML cells while sparing the normal counterparts. DS/Cu also significantly inhibited the growth of human CD34/CD38 leukemic cell-derived xenografts in NOD/SCID mice. Mechanistically, DS/Cu-induced cytotoxicity was closely associated with activation of the stress-related ROS-JNK pathway as well as simultaneous inactivation of the pro-survival Nrf2 and nuclear factor-\u03baB pathways. In summary, our findings indicate that DS/Cu selectively targets leukemia stem-like cells both in vitro and in vivo, thus suggesting a promising LSC-targeted activity of this repurposed agent for treatment of relapsed and refractory AML.",

Mounting studies have suggested an involvement of angiogenesis signaling in NHLs progression and resistance to treatment. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of CS2164, a novel receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor selectively targeting VEGFR-2 and Aurora B in NHL cells. By in vitro culture system and in vivo xenograft model, we found that CS2164 significantly inhibited cell growth and abolished clonogenicity in NHL cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, CS2164 significantly induced NHL cells apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Moreover, CS2164 suppressed NHL cells growth and progression in an in vivo xenograft model. Mechanistically, CS2164-induced cytotoxicity was closely associated with inhibition of VEGFR2 and Aurora B as well as their downstream signaling cascades, including P38, ERK and H3 pathways. In conclusion, CS2164 exerts its cytotoxic effect via inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis by modulating VEGFR2 and Aurora B signaling pathway, supporting a potential role for CS2164 in the treatment of NHLs.",

        "abstract": "Backgrounds : The long term prognosis of adult B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is poor when compared with pediatric B-ALL. The current therapeutic regimen for adult B-ALL often results in refractory and relapsing diseases. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore novel approaches to treat adult B-ALL. Disulfiram (DS) has been used clinically as a safe anti-alcoholism drug for over 6 decades. Recent studies demonstrated that disulfiram/cooper mixture (DS/Cu) was cytotoxic to multiple solid cancers, but its effects on B-ALL cells are still unclear. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of the cytotoxicity of DS/Cu to tumor cells was poorly defined. In this study, we investigated the effects of DS/Cu on B-ALL cells in vitro and its related cytotoxic mechanism.Results: Firstly, CCK8 assay indicated that DS/Cu markedly inhibited Nalm6 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Secondly, colony-forming assay showed that DS/Cu also abolished the clonogenicity of Nalm6 cells (Pu003c0.001). Thirdly, FACS analyses revealed that DS/Cu mixture could induce apoptosis of Nalm6 cells, as well as primary B-ALL cells (n=16) in a dose-dependent manner. We additionally analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics of B-ALL patients, including age, WBC counts, immunophenotype, cytogenetics, risk stratification and Ph chromosome, with the efficacy of DS/Cu on B-ALL cells. The apoptosis isolated from pro-B and cytogenetic abnormality B-ALL pastients was higher. Therefore, our results demonstrated that DS/Cu mixture could induce significant cytotoxicity against B-ALL cells in vitro.To decipher the cytotoxic mechanism of DS/Cu mixture, JC-1 staining was done and the results showed that DS/Cu mixture could significantly reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in Nalm6 cells (Pu003c0.01) and 7 cases of primary B-ALL cells (Pu003c0.05). Consistently, Western Blot analysis showed that DS/Cu induced B-ALL cell apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 and Bcl-XL, as well as activating caspase-3 and its substrate PARP. Hence, our results indicated that DS/Cu induced apoptosis of B-ALL cells at least partly through the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that DS/Cu not only significantly inhibit proliferation and clonogenicity, but also induce apoptosis of B-ALL cells in vitro.The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway might be the molecular mechanism of DS/Cu-induced apoptosis of B-ALL cells.Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",

        "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneity disease initiating from a rare population of cells known as leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which have been a major hurdle for the success of acute myeloid leukemia chemotherapy. Therefore, new drugs targeting LSCs is urgently needed.  Disulfiram (DS) has been used clinically as a safe anti-alcoholism drug for over 6 decades. Recent studies demonstrated that disulfiram combined with cooper (DS/Cu) have the antitumor activity in a wide range of cancer cell lines. CD34 +  CD38 -  KG1a cells were previous found to have the characteristics of stem cells. Here, we explored whether DS/Cu could induce acute myeloid leukemic stem-like KG1a cells apoptosis and further investigated the molecular mechanism.  CD34 +  CD38 -  KG1a cells were sorted from KG1a cell lines by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis confirmed the percentage of CD34 +  CD38 -  KG1a cells was 95.37\u00b11.84%. To determine the effect of DS/Cu induced apoptosis in LSC-like KG1a cells, CD34 +  CD38 -  KG1a cells were exposed to DS (5nM) with or without Cu (0.5nM) for 24h. FCM analysis showed the apoptotic proportion of CD34 +  CD38 -  KG1\u03b1 cells exposed to DS was 11.87\u00b11.30%, while 27.43\u00b11.65% to DS/Cu (P=0.00). To explore the role of ROS in DS/Cu induced apoptosis, ROS levels were detected using DCFH-DA after KG1a cells being treated with DS and DS/Cu for 24h. DS and DS/Cu could induce ROS acumulation by 1.39\u00b10.115 fold and 2.81\u00b10.109 fold, respectively (P  To explore the upstream pathway of ROS accumulation induced by DS and DS/Cu in CD34+CD38-KG1\u03b1 cells, We examined the expression of apoptosis-related moleculars include TNF-a,CD40, TNFRSF11B, TNFRSF1B, Hrk in LSC-like KG1a cells exposed to DS, DS/ Cu and DS/Cu+NAC for 24h. DS and DS/Cu up-regulated TNF-a, CD40, TNFRSF11B, TNFRSF1B, Hrk expression at the mRNA level (P  To further investigate the role of TNF-a in DS/Cu induced accumulation of ROS, CD34 +  CD38 -  KG1\u03b1 cells were pretreated with neutralizing antibody TNF-a mAb (2\u03bcg/mL) , control antibody IgG (2\u03bcg/mL) for 2h, then cells were exposed to DS/Cu for 24h. ROS accumulation induced by DS/Cu was inhibited by pretreatment with TNF-a mAb (2.78\u00b10.25 vs. 1.28\u00b10.17 folds, P=0.00), while pretreatment with IgG had no impact on ROS accumulation induced by DS/Cu (P=0.23). TNF-a mAb and IgG alone had no effect on ROS accumulation in KG1a cells ( Pu003e0.05). These results confirmed that TNF-a is upstream molecular of ROS induced by DS/Cu in leukemia stem-like KG1a cells.  In conclusion, our data demonstrated that DS/Cu could induce leukemia stem-like KG1a cells apoptosis, and the underlying mechanisms may be related with TNF-a/ROS pathway.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the co-expression of these two molecules and the clinical prognosis of pancreatic cancer. Methods We investigated the expression of TN-C and MMP-9 in 103 pancreatic cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry and used statistical analyses to investigate the correlations of individual expression or co-expression of these two molecules with clinicopathological parameters and survival of pancreatic cancer. Results The expression of MMP-9 and TN-C were increased in pancreatic cancer. The co-expression of MMP-9 and TN-C was also detected. The expression of MMP-9 and TN-C were correlated with vascular invasion, lymph node invasion, liver metastases and TNM stage. The co-expression of MMP-9 and TN-C was significantly related to the pancreatic cancer metastases. The individual overexpression of MMP-9 or TN-C significantly decreased the overall survival rates. The co-expression of MMP-9 and TN-C had the lowest overall survival rates. The co-expression of MMP-9 and TN-C was an independent predictor of survival for pancreatic cancer patients. Conclusions Co-expression of MMP-9 and TN-C was associated with poorer prognosis and was found to be an independent predictor of survival.",

However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of exosomal circ-RNA in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor progression remain unclear. Here, we identified a circular RNA (circ-PDE8A) from liver-metastatic PDAC cells by microarray analysis, detected its expression levels in clinical tissues and found that high circ-PDE8A expression was correlated with lymphatic invasion, TNM stage and a poor survival rate of PDAC patients. Further study revealed that circ-PDE8A promotes the invasive growth of PDAC cells via upregulating MET. Circ-PDE8A acts as a ceRNA for miR-338 to regulate MACC1 and stimulates invasive growth via the MACC/MET/ERK or AKT pathways. We further imaged the exosome communication between tumor cells and identified the tumor secreted exosomes in blood circulation. Finally, we analyzed the circ-PDE8A expression in plasma exosomes of PDAC patients and found that exosomal circ-PDE8A was associated with progression and prognosis in PDAC patients. Thus, circ-PDE8A may play an important role in tumor invasion, and exosomal circ-PDE8A may be a useful marker of PDAC diagnosis or progression.",

Their postoperative clinical behaviors and the exact HBV Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) thresholds that distinguish good and poor prognoses are unknown. This study aimed to compare clinicopathological, pre- and postoperative clinical factors and overall and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between HBV-HCC patients and nonhepatitis B and nonhepatitis C HCC (NBC-HCC) patients to determine the optimal prognostic HBV DNA threshold.Data from 1440 patients with HBV-HCC and NBC-HCC who underwent curative hepatectomy were retrospectively analyzed.Liver function in the HBV-HCC group was significantly worse than in the NBC-HCC group. Compared with NBC-HCC patients, HBV-HCC patients had significantly more vascular invasion and advanced HCC. The HBV-HCC patients also had significantly worse liver function and more complications. Further survival analysis showed significantly lower overall and RFS rates and a higher early recurrence rate in the HBV-HCC group. Univariate analysis indicated that HBV was a risk factor for overall and RFS. Finally, X-tile analysis revealed that the optimal HBV DNA cutoff points for predicting RFS and overall survival in HCC patients were 10,100 and 12,800\u200aIU/mL, respectively.After hepatectomy for HCC, HBV-HCC patients had more complications and a worse prognosis than NBC-HCC patients. Antiviral therapy should be considered before hepatectomy in patients with high (more than approximately 104\u200aIU/mL) HBV DNA levels.",

The device consists of a plasmonic perfect absorber with a built-in pyroelectric ZnO layer: It consists of a ZnO layer sandwiched by a Au microhole array as a top electrode and a Pt bottom electrode as a template for the uniaxially grown ZnO film. The geometrical design of the plasmonic Au (hole array)/ZnO/Pt system is determined by the numerical electromagnetic simulation and then fabricated by colloidal-mask lithography combined with reactive-ion etching. The fabricated detectors exhibit excellent spectral selectivity at the predesigned plasmonic resonances, which are tunable by changing the Au hole diameters. The results obtained here open up a route for realizing a new type of uncooled spectroscopic infrared detectors with a compact design and simple fabrication process.",

Using numerical electromagnetic simulations, we optimize the geometrical parameters of Al perfect absorbers (AlPAs) with resonances at desired wavelengths depending on the applications. The fabricated AlPAs exhibit narrowband absorptions with high efficiency up to 98 %. By tuning AlPAs parameters, the resonance of AlPAs can be tuned from the visible to the middle infrared region. The AlPAs can be applied for spectrally selective infrared devices such as selective thermal emitters, selective surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy (SEIRA) for molecular sensing and selective IR detectors. In this report, we demonstrate applications of AlPAs for selective thermal emitters and SEIRA. The results obtained here reveal a simple technique to fabricate scalable plasmonic perfect absorbers as well as their potential applications in optoelectronic and photonic devices.",

The multiple sizes and shapes of Au nano-islands on patchy Au nanoshells and their plasmonic coupling exhibit broadband resonances ranging from the near infrared (NIR) region to the middle infrared (MIR) region, making patchy Au particles ensemble suitable for both SEIRA and SERS applications. In the SEIRA application, we demonstrate  in situ  and real-time monitoring of monolayer of reduced glutathione molecules (GSH) adsorbed on the plasmonic Au surface. By using GSH as the molecular linker, we also demonstrate  in situ  detection of trace amount of mercuric ions in water at nanomolar level.

In this work, at first mode analysis of a subwavelength sphere in a complex permittivity plane is provided to simultaneously examine the Mie and plasmon resonances at once, which are often discussed separately. Electromagnetic calculations show enhanced absorption of germanium nanospheres at Mie resonances. To experimentally confirm the predicted results, germanium nanoparticles are successfully fabricated through reactive thermal arc plasma method. The size distribution of germanium nanoparticles enables broad extinction from UV to near infrared even though the Mie resonance peak of individual nanoparticles is rather narrow. Enhanced absorption is confirmed by a solar photothermal experiment. The work proves the applicability of strong Mie resonances excited at subwavelength germanium particles.",

        "abstract": "Plasmonic nanoantennas afford significantly enhanced near-fields that can be exploited for ultrasensitive molecular sensing in plasmon-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy. While elemental gold is usually used in plasmonic biosensing due to its stability and well-established surface functionalization, compound plasmonic materials with versatile surface functionalization, low-cost, and lower optical loss especially in the infrared range are receiving considerable attention. This study demonstrates the application of protein-functionalized single-crystalline indium-tin oxide (ITO) nanorod arrays for biosensing in infrared spectroscopy. The ITO nanorod arrays show angle-dependent plasmon resonances in the mid-infrared range, whose position and intensity can be readily tuned by varying the incident angle, thereby providing an easy means for selective enhancement of targeted molecular vibrations. The use of phosphonic-acid-derived biotin molecules is examined to chemically functionalize the antennas, and the specific adsorption of streptavidin onto them is subsequently demonstrated. The successful surface functionalization of the ITO nanorods demonstrated here facilitates the detection of functional biomolecules and proteins with high specificity.",

The precisely designed plasmonic resonator with dual-band perfect absorption (DPA) shows strongly-enhanced nearfield intensity and polarization independence, at both resonances, providing a powerful antenna platform for the multi-band vibrational sensing. As a proof of concept, we experimentally apply the plasmonic DPAs in bond-selective dual-band infrared sensing of an ultrathin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, simultaneously amplifying two representative vibrational bands (asymmetric C-H stretching of CH3 at 2962 cm-1 and CH3 deformation of Si-CH3 at 1263 cm-1) by surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA). The plasmonic DPA was successfully adopted for the in situ monitoring of reaction kinetics, by recording the spectral changes in C-H stretching and Si-CH3 deformation modes of a 10 nm PDMS elastomer, which are selectively enhanced by the two antenna resonances, during its gelation process. Our systematic study of the SEIRA spectra has demonstrated mode splitting and a clear avoided-crossing in the dispersion curve as a function of resonance frequency of DPA, manifesting itself as a promising basis for future polaritonic devices utilizing the hybridization between the molecular vibrational states and the enhanced light field.",

Following Kirchhoff\u2019s law, their emission spectra exhibited sharp single emission peaks indicating high potential as narrow-band infrared emitters. The results obtained here demonstrate that earth-abundant aluminum is a high-performance plasmonic materials in the mid-infrared range, and open up a route for fabricating cost-effective scalable plasmonic devices such as efficient light harvesting structures, thermal emitters, and infrared sensors.",

        "abstract": "Iron(III) titanates are composed of earth-abundant elements and are attracting rapidly growing interest as highly promising candidates for solar-energy as well as optoelectronics applications. In this article, we report on the successful synthesis of pseudobrookite Fe2TiO5 thin films with RF sputtering followed by post-deposition annealing in air. The chemical composition, crystal structure, surface morphology, and optical properties of the films were characterized both experimentally and theoretically. The film was confirmed to be single phase and exhibited a highly crystalline orthorhombic structure with a preferential crystal orientation of (131) with excellent adhesion on both glass and silicon substrates, indicating that an epitaxial substrate is not required. Dielectric functions from spectroscopic ellipsometry and density functional theory (DFT) also provide a good understanding of the optical characteristics of the films.",

The results show the following: (1) the friction torque declines rapidly at the beginning of the experiments, and meanwhile, the maximum normal load and the torsional angle amplitude show very little effect on the steady value; (2) the wear loss decreases with the increased torsional angle amplitude but increases with the increased maximum normal load; additionally, as the cycle times increase, the wear rate decreases, and the wear is minimal; (3) unloading and secondary loading significantly reduce the friction and wear of the materials, and thus, patients should rest after prolonged exercise to reduce wear; (4) the margins of UHMWPE and CoCrMo are worn, and the wear mechanism is abrasive wear; (5) around the center of the UHMWPE, the surface is peeled off, and the wear mechanism is fatigue wear; and (6) in terms of the compressive stress and shear stress, the calculated results from a finite element model match the experimental results well.",

Proper function of the equipment involves controlled frictional contact between a rope and a lining. While there has been a lot of empirical testing of friction hoist materials, studies of the effects of their microstructure and basic properties on friction and wear have largely been neglected. Three commercial grade linings with similar compositions were investigated (trade names: K25, G30, and GM-3). Their thermo-physical properties were measured using XPS, FTIR and TGA. Their hardness and other properties were correlated with their microstructures and frictional behavior. The DTG curves of the three linings follow a similar pattern and their weight loss rate peaks occur in the second stage due to the cyclodehydration of phenolic hydroxyl and fracture of methylene. GM-3, which is highest content of inorganic filler, had the smallest weight loss. Reciprocating sliding friction and wear tests indicated that higher contents of methylene and filler improve the friction coefficient. Adhesive wear is observed when the friction material hardness is relatively low. When the sliding velocity increases, the friction coefficient of two of the linings (K25 and GM-3) increases, but that of G30 first rises then falls. The reasons for these differences in behavior are discussed.",

The static and dynamic viscoelasticity behaviors of hydrogel grafted with ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) were studied by finite-element method (FEM) and dynamic mechanical analysis in this article. The results show that creep deformation presents an exponential function with the pore fluid velocity of hydrogel material. During the first period of stress relaxation, the internal fluid pore pressure of hydrogel material is less than partial pressure, which leads to the increasing fluid exudation, and the stress relaxation rate changes quickly. With the loss of fluid, the pore pressure and partial pressure achieve balance. Then, finally, stress relaxation reaches relative equilibrium. The storage modulus of hydrogel material increases with the increasing frequency, and there is a logarithmic regression between them.

        "abstract": "CoCrMo alloy and UHMWPE have been widely used in knee joint prosthesis implantation materials. In this paper, swing friction behavior of the contact interface between CoCrMo alloy and UHMWPE is studied under dynamic loading. Swing friction characteristic and damage mechanism are discussed. The results show that swing friction coefficients increase with the rising of maximum normal load and swing angular amplitude. Unloading-standing could play alleviative roles in friction and wear to a large degree. As the cycle number gradually increases, the surface roughness of UHMWPE decreases, while the roughness of CoCrMo increases. During the swing friction, the main damage mechanism of CoCrMo is abrasive wear and the main damage mechanisms of UHMWPE are abrasive wear, fatigue wear and plastic deformation. Besides, it is easier to generate surface damages with small angle and heavy load.",

Therefore, cartilage covering the joint surface bears the repeated friction which is caused by the different movements during the whole life. So sliding, swing and torsion friction behavior of hydrogels need to be researched as synthetic articular cartilage. In this paper, PVA/HA composite hydrogel is cross-linked on the UHMWPE surface through chemical grafting and freezing-thawing method. Biotribology behavior and fluid load support are researched. The results show that swing and torsion friction coefficients are negligibly small, while sliding friction coefficient is largest. There is a negative linear relationship between fluid load support and friction coefficient. Fluid load supports are relative high under swing and torsion friction, so the swing and torsion friction coefficients are relative low. Hydrogel can be replenished by re-swelling to sustain the fluid pressurization during friction under lubrication condition. Both fluid load support and biphasic lubrication due to its porous structure with large amount of water contribute to the low friction coefficient.",

The tension and longitudinal vibration characteristics of the rope are obtained through experiments. The dynamics of rope and friction transmission are obtained by a validated simulation model. The results show that the rope tension is divided into the dynamic tension regime and inertial tension regime due to the multi-frequency cross-linking. The longitudinal rope vibration is embodied as random perturbation. The reduction of the friction coefficient will increase the sliding between the rope and lining, and it will be beneficial to narrowing the dynamic tension regime. The increase in the longitudinal rope vibration will reduce the friction force between the rope and lining.",

Friction and wear mechanisms were analysed by dynamically monitoring the viscoelastic slippage and temperature of the friction interface. The results show that the friction coefficient was positively correlated with the loss factor. Friction and wear both decreased with the increase of the interfacial friction temperature. The wear increased exponentially with the increase of the loss factor. Friction and wear properties of three types of friction linings were compared; the loss factor of K25 lining was the largest (0.21); the sticking time of the K25 lining was the longest (0.27\u202fs), and its friction coefficient was the largest (0.67) in the early stage of the friction experiment. As the friction experiment progressed, the temperature of the interface increased. The loss factor and the friction coefficient decreased noticeably with the increase of temperature. This resulted in less friction, less surface damage and fewer cracks and debris. The wear of the K25 lining was the smallest (0.32\u202fg).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The life of damaged wire rope is difficult to judge and the damaged wire rope is prematurely replaced resulting in an enormous economic waste. This paper studies the effect of different distributions of pre-broken wires on bending fatigue behavior of wire ropes using a self-made bending fatigue test facility. The fatigue lives of wire ropes with different distributions of pre-broken wires were studied using both visual inspection and commercial non-destructive inspection technology, combined with electron microscopy. It is found that broken wires on the surface reduce the bending fatigue life of wire ropes. The broken wires increase the stress in the inner wire strands as well as the contact force between the wires. This leads to a concentration of severe wear, which accelerates the density of broken wires locally, leading to short fatigue lives especially in the case with the most concentrated number of pre-broken wires (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04). After numerous wires fail by wear and fatigue, others fail by tensile overload, as evidenced microscopically by necking and ductile failure. The damage in the rope at failure defined by counting broken wires is nearly 50% smaller than the damage value given by the commercial non-destructive damage value, based on magnetic measurements.",

Fretting fatigue behavior and the influence of crossing angles on this behavior are studied by analyzing the  F   t  - D-N  curve. The results show that contact load increases as total wear volume and the friction coefficient of steel wire decrease with the crossing angle of 18\u00b0 in the mixed and partial slip regimes. In the slip regime, both variables increase. When the strain ratios decrease, fretting amplitude increases and the fretting regime shifts from the partial slip one to the mixed and slip regimes, the total wear volume, friction coefficient, and friction surface area of the loaded steel wire all increase, whereas the contact load in the fretting area of this wire decreases. Lower contact load, total wear volume and friction coefficient and longer fretting fatigue life were induced by the crossing angle of 18\u00b0 than when this angle is 90\u00b0. Few wear particles and furrows are observed in the three fretting regimes of the wearing surface. The main wear mechanisms are adhesive and fatigue wear. However, more obvious wear particles and furrows can be observed with the crossing angle of 90\u00b0.",

These studies are helpful to understand the interaction between SF, GT and n-HA, and provide a theoretical basis for the preparation of better silk fibroin-based composite scaffolds.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A deep gradient wear-resistant layer is applied to 20CrMnTi gear steel with high hardness and thick case. The tribological properties of wear-resistant layers are studied with different relative rolling-sliding ratios. The results indicate that the overall wear resistance of the deep-gradient-layer sample is 1.8\u20136 times higher than that of the conventional heat treatment sample. The deep-gradient-layer sample is less sensitive to tangential force compared with the conventional heat treatment sample and the work hardening degree is decreased to 41.8%, 60.7% and 62.6% with different relative rolling-sliding ratios. The wear mechanism of the conventional heat treatment sample is mainly surface failure caused by contact fatigue, which is manifested by pitting and surface exfoliation. The wear mechanism of the deep-gradient-layer sample is surface failure caused by scratch, which causes surface bruising and ploughing.",

        "abstract": "Ancient Jian wares are famous for their lustrous black glaze that exhibits unique colored patterns. Some striking examples include the brownish colored \"Hare's Fur\" (HF) strips and the silvery \"Oil Spot\" (OS) patterns. Herein, we investigated the glaze surface of HF and OS samples using a variety of characterization methods. Contrary to the commonly accepted theory, we identified the presence of \u03b5-Fe2O3, a rare metastable polymorph of Fe2O3 with unique magnetic properties, in both HF and OS samples. We found that surface crystals of OS samples are up to several micrometers in size and exclusively made of \u03b5-Fe2O3. Interestingly, these \u03b5-Fe2O3 crystals on the OS sample surface are organized in a periodic two dimensional fashion. These results shed new lights on the actual mechanisms and kinetics of polymorphous transitions of Fe2O3. Deciphering technologies behind the fabrication of ancient Jian wares can thus potentially help researchers improve the \u03b5-Fe2O3 synthesis.",

Preservation of the single crystalline nature and prevention of thermal mechanical failure are two of the most essential issues for the application of this technique. Here we employ synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction to evaluate the quality in terms of crystal orientation and defect distribution of a Ni-based superalloy DZ125L directly formed by a laser additive process rooted from a single crystalline substrate of the same material. We show that a disorientation gradient caused by a high density of geometrically necessary dislocations and resultant subgrains exists in the interfacial region between the epitaxial and stray grains. This creates a potential relationship of stray grain formation and defect accumulation. The observation offers new directions on the study of performance control and reliability of the laser additive manufactured superalloys.",

Nanoindentation tests show the hardness to be uniformly lower in the bulk of the substrate and constantly higher in the epitaxial cladding layer. A gradient of hardness through the heat affected zone is also observed, resulting from an increase in dislocation density, as indicated by the broadening of the synchrotron X-ray Laue microdiffraction reflections. The hardening mechanism of the cladding region, on the other hand, is shown to originate not only from high dislocation density but also and more importantly from the fine \u03b3/\u03b3\u2032 microstructure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Laser 3D printing is a promising technique to repair damaged Ni-based superalloy components. However, the occurrence of heat affected zone (HAZ) cracking severely limits its applicability. Here we unravel the cracking mechanism by studying the element, phase, defect, and strain distribution around an intergranular crack that initiated from the primary HAZ. Using synchrotron X-ray Laue microdiffraction, we measured high tensile strain/stress transverse to the building direction in both the primary HAZ and the cladding layers, as well as high-density dislocations, which resulted from the thermal contraction and rapid precipitation of \u03b3\u2032 phase. The crack initiated because the transverse tensile strain/stress tore up the liquid film formed by the low-melting point preexisting phases in the primary HAZ, such as \u03b3/\u03b3\u2032 eutectics and coarse \u03b3\u2032 precipitates. The incoherent carbide particles were frequently observed near the crack root as local strain concentrators. In the cladding layers, micro-segregation could not be completely avoided, thus the hot crack continued to propagate over several layers with the assistance of the transverse tensile stress. Our investigations provide a useful guideline for the optimization of the 3D printing process to repair Ni-based superalloys with high susceptibility to hot cracking.",

Osteoclasts play important roles in bone resorption whose hyperfunction are closely related to osteolytic lesions. Studies on osteoclast differentiation and function assist in the prevention of excessive bone loss associated diseases. We screened a variety of natural compounds with anti-inflammatory effect and found that poria cocos polysaccharide (PCP) inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and bone resorption via TRAcP staining, immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and western blot. PCP down-regulated phosphorylation of STAT3, P38, ERK and JNK, and thus repressed the expression of NFAcT1 and c-Fos during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Besides, the expression of bone resorption related genes such as TRAcP and CTSK was suppressed by PCP. The results suggest that PCP can be invoked as a candidate for the treatment of osteolytic diseases by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic balance between bone resorption and bone formation is crucial to maintain bone mass. Osteoclasts are key cells that perform bone resorption while osteoblasts and osteocytes function in bone formation. Osteoporosis, a bone metabolism disease characterized by bone loss and degradation of bone microstructure, occurs when osteoclastic bone resorption outstrips osteoblastic bone synthesis. The interaction between receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) and RANK on the surface of bone marrow macrophages promotes osteoclast differentiation and activation. In this study, we found that lumichrome, a photodegradation product of riboflavin, inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption as determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, immunofluorescence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and western blot. Our results showed that lumichrome represses the expression of osteoclast marker genes, including cathepsin K (Ctsk) and Nfatc1. In addition, lumichrome suppressed RANKL-induced calcium oscillations, NFATc1, NF-\u03baB, and MAPK signaling activation. Moreover, lumichrome promoted osteoblast differentiation at an early stage, as demonstrated by upregulated expression of osteoblast marker genes Alp, Runx2, and Col1a1. We also found that lumichrome reduces bone loss in ovariectomized mice by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. In summary, our data suggest the potential of lumichrome as a therapeutic drug for osteolytic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a metabolic disease characterized by osteopenia and bone microstructural deterioration. Osteoclasts are the primary effector cells that degrade bone matrix and their abnormal function leads to the development of osteoporosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation during cellular metabolism promotes osteoclast proliferation and differentiation, therefore, playing an important role in osteoporosis. Cistanche deserticola polysaccharide (CDP) possesses antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity. However, the impact of CDP on osteoclasts is unclear. In this study, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, immunofluorescence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analysis were utilized to demonstrate that CDP inhibited osteoclastogenesis and hydroxyapatite resorption. In addition, CDP also inhibited the expression of osteoclast maker genes including Ctsk, Mmp9, and Acp5 and had no effect on receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB (RANK) expression. Mechanistic analyses revealed that CDP increases the expression of antioxidant enzymes to attenuate RANKL-mediated ROS production in osteoclasts and inhibits nuclear factor of activated T cells and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. These results suggest that CDP may represent a candidate drug for the treatment of osteoporosis caused by excessive osteoclast activity.",

        "abstract": "Osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption during the process of bone remodeling. Increased osteoclast numbers and bone resorption activity are the main factors contributing to bone loss-related diseases such as osteoporosis. Therefore, modulating the formation and function of osteoclasts is critical for the effective treatment of osteolysis and osteoporosis. Kavain is the active ingredient extracted from the root of the kava plant, which possesses known anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effects of kavain on osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption remain unclear. In this study, we found that kavain inhibits receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation and fusion using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, kavain inhibited bone resorption performed by osteoclasts. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, we found that kavain downregulates the expression of osteoclast marker genes, such as nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1), v-atpase d2 (Atp6v0d2), dendrocyte expressed seven transmembrane protein (Dcstamp), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (Mmp9), cathepsin K (Ctsk), and Acp5. Additionally, kavain repressed RANKL-induced calcium oscillations, nuclear factor of activated T cells activation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, while leaving NF-\u03baB unaffected. We found no effects of kavain on either osteoblast proliferation or differentiation. Besides, kavain inhibited bone loss in ovariectomized mice by suppressing osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, these data suggest a potential use for kavain as a candidate drug for the treatment of osteolytic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is the most common osteolytic disease characterized by excessive osteoclast formation and resultant bone loss, which afflicts millions of patients around the world. Madecassoside (MA), isolated from Centella asiatica, was reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, but its role in osteoporosis treatment has not yet been confirmed. In our study, MA was found to have an inhibitory effect on the RANKL-induced formation and function of OCs in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. These effects were attributed to its ability to suppress the activity of two transcription factors (NFATc1 and c-Fos) indispensable for osteoclast formation, followed by inhibition of the expression of bone resorption-related genes and proteins (Acp5/TRAcP, CTSK, ATP6V0D2/V-ATPase-d2, and integrin \u03b23). Furthermore, we examined the underlying mechanisms and found that MA represses osteoclastogenesis by blocking Ca oscillations and the NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways. In addition, the therapeutic effect of MA on preventing bone loss in\u00a0vivo was further confirmed in an ovariectomized mouse model. Therefore, considering its ability to inhibit RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis and the underlying mechanisms, MA might be a potential candidate for treating osteolytic bone diseases.",

        "abstract": "Excessive osteoclast formation and function are considered as the main causes of bone lytic disorders such as osteoporosis and osteolysis. Therefore, the osteoclast is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of osteoporosis or other osteoclast-related diseases. Helvolic acid (HA), a mycotoxin originally isolated from Aspergillus fumigatus , has been discovered as an effective broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and has a wide range of pharmacological properties. Herein, for the first time, HA was demonstrated to be capable of significantly inhibiting receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vitro by suppressing nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) activation. This inhibition was followed by the dramatically decreased expression of NFATc1-targeted genes including Ctr (encoding calcitonin receptor), Acp5 (encoding tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase [TRAcP]), Ctsk (encoding cathepsin K), Atp6v0d2 (encoding the vacuolar H+ ATPase V0 subunit d2 [V-ATPase-d2]) and Mmp9 (encoding matrix metallopeptidase 9) which are osteoclastic-specific genes required for osteoclast formation and function. Mechanistically, HA was shown to greatly attenuate multiple upstream pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, c-Fos signaling, and intracellular Ca  oscillation, but had little effect on nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation. In addition, HA also diminished the RANKL-induced generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Taken together, our study indicated HA effectively suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and function. Thus, we propose that HA can be potentially used in the development of a novel drug for osteoclast-related bone diseases.",

In our study, we investigated the anti-osteoclastogenic effect of evodiamine (EVO) in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro, as well as the underlying mechanism. By using an in\u00a0vitro bone marrow macrophage (BMM)-derived osteoclast culture system, we found that EVO inhibited osteoclast formation, hydroxyapatite resorption and receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast marker gene and protein expression. Mechanistically, we found that EVO inhibited the degradation and RANKL-induced transcriptional activity of I\u03baB\u03b1. RANKL-induced Ca oscillations were also abrogated by EVO. In vivo, an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model was established to mimic PMO, and OVX mice received oral administration of either EVO (10\u00a0mg/kg) or saline every other day. We found that EVO can attenuate bone loss in OVX mice by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, our findings suggest that EVO suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through NF-\u03baB and calcium signalling pathways and has potential value as a therapeutic agent for PMO.",

        "abstract": " Growing evidence indicates that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation is a critical factor in the development of osteoporosis by triggering osteoclast formation and function. Pseurotin A (Pse) is a secondary metabolite isolated from Aspergillus fumigatus with antioxidant properties, recently shown to exhibit a wide range of potential therapeutic applications. However, its effects on osteoporosis remain unknown. This study aimed to explore whether Pse, by suppressing ROS level, is able to inhibit osteoclastogenesis and prevent the bone loss induced by estrogen-deficiency in ovariectomized (OVX) mice.  The effects of Pse on receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorptive function were examined by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAcP) staining and hydroxyapatite resorption assay. 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (HDCFDA) was used to detect intracellular ROS production . Western blot assay was used to identify proteins associated with ROS generation and scavenging as well as ROS-mediated signaling cascades including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), NF-\u03baB pathways, and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) signaling. The expression of osteoclast-specific genes was assessed by qPCR. The  potential of Pse was determined using an OVX mouse model administered with Pse or vehicle for 6 weeks.  ROS production was assessed by intravenous injection of dihydroethidium (DHE) into OVX mice 24h prior to killing. After sacrifice, the bone samples were analyzed using micro-CT and histomorphometry to determine bone volume, osteoclast activity, and ROS level .  Pse was demonstrated to inhibit osteoclastogenesis and bone resorptive function , as well as the downregulation of osteoclast-specific genes including  (encoding TRAcP),  (encoding cathepsin K), and  (encoding matrix metalloproteinase 9). Mechanistically, Pse suppressed intracellular ROS level by inhibiting RANKL-induced ROS production and enhancing ROS scavenging enzymes, subsequently suppressing MAPK pathway (ERK, P38, and JNK) and NF-\u03baB pathways, leading to the inhibition of NFATc1 signaling. Micro-CT and histological data indicated that OVX procedure resulted in a significant bone loss, with dramatically increased the number of osteoclasts on the bone surface as well as increased ROS level in the bone marrow microenvironment; whereas Pse supplementation was capable of effectively preventing these OVX-induced changes.  Pse was demonstrated for the first time as a novel alternative therapy for osteoclast-related bone diseases such as osteoporosis through suppressing ROS level.",

        "abstract": ": Osteoporosis is a severe bone disorder that is a threat to our aging population. Excessive osteoclast formation and bone resorption lead to changes in trabecular bone volume and architecture, leaving the bones vulnerable to fracture. Therapeutic approaches of inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption have been proven to be an efficient approach to prevent osteoporosis. In our study, we have demonstrated for the first time that Loureirin B (LrB) inhibits ovariectomized osteoporosis and explored its underlying mechanisms of action . : We examined the effects of LrB on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, and its impacts on RANKL-induced NFATc1 activation, calcium oscillations and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in osteoclasts . We assessed the  efficacy of LrB using an ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis model, which was analyzed using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and bone histomorphometry. : We found that LrB represses osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, F-actin belts formation, osteoclast specific gene expressions, ROS activity and calcium oscillations through preventing NFATc1 translocation and expression as well as affecting MAPK-NFAT signaling pathways . Our  study indicated that LrB prevents OVX-induced osteoporosis and preserves bone volume by repressing osteoclast activity and function. : Our findings confirm that LrB can attenuate osteoclast formation and OVX-induced osteoporosis. This novel and exciting discovery could pave the way for the development of LrB as a potential therapeutic treatment for osteoporosis.",

This method allows the site- and diastereoselective fluorination of \u03b2-methylene C(sp3)\u2013H bonds of \u03b1-amino acid derivatives. A range of substrates containing both aliphatic and benzylic C(sp3)\u2013H bonds were compatible with this protocol, leading to an array of \u03b2-fluorinated \u03b1-amino acids. Stoichiometric fluorination of an isolated palladacycle intermediate takes place rapidly under very mild reaction conditions (room temperature, 5\u201310 min). Data from preliminary mechanistic studies are consistent with direct C\u2013F reductive elimination from a high-valent intermediate.",

        "abstract": "Cantharidin, one of the active components of mylabris, is believed to have antitumor activity. Cantharidin selectively inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which can repress multiple oncogenic kinases (ERK, JNK, PKC, and NF-\u03baB). Researches in vitro have shown that cantharidin suppresses cell viability and metastasis in pancreatic cancer cells. This study aims to investigate the effects of cantharidin on pancreatic cancer xenografts in vivo. Xenograft models were established using cells stably expressing luciferase. Xenograft growth was evaluated by living imaging. Gene expression was determined using a microarray, real-time PCR, a RayBiotech antibody array, and the Milliplex assay. Surprisingly, cantharidin significantly accelerated xenograft growth. Living imaging showed a rapid distribution of D-luciferin in cantharidin-treated xenografts, suggesting a rich blood supply. Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased angiogenesis. Microarray and antibody array identified upregulated proangiogenic and downregulated antiangiogenic factors. The Milliplex assay suggested elevated secretion of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and VEGF. Inhibitors of ERK, JNK, PKC, and NF-\u03baB pathway attenuated the cantharidin-induced changes to proangiogenic gene expression. PKC pathway-inhibiting tamoxifen or antiangiogenic therapeutics, including Ginsenoside Rg3, bevacizumab, Apatinib, and Endostar, antagonized the proangiogenic effect of cantharidin or its derivatives. These regimens presented remarkable additive antitumor effects in vivo. Although cantharidin presents antitumor effects in vitro and has been applied in clinical practice, we revealed an unfavorable proangiogenic side effect. We recommend that the clinical application of cantharidin should be performed on the premise of antivascularization therapy.",

Activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis. We investigated the inhibitory effect of FH535 on the metastasis and growth of pancreatic cancer cells. Western blotting and luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that FH535 markedly inhibited Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway viability in pancreatic cancer cells. In vitro wound healing, invasion, and adhesion assays revealed that FH535 significantly inhibited pancreatic cancer cell metastasis. We also observed the inhibitory effect of FH535 on pancreatic cancer cell growth via the tetrazolium and plate clone formation assays. Microarray analyses suggested that changes in the expression of multiple genes could be involved in the anti-cancer effect of FH535 on pancreatic cancer cells. Our results indicate for the first time that FH535 inhibits pancreatic cancer cell metastasis and growth, providing new insight into therapy of pancreatic cancer. ",

Although there are standard treatments for pancreatic AC, no precise therapies exist for pancreatic SCC. Here, we screened 1033 cases of pancreatic cancer and identified 2 cases of pure SCC, which were pathologically diagnosed on the basis of finding definite intercellular bridges and/or focal keratin peal formation in the tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry assay confirmed the positive expression of CK5/6 and p63 in pancreatic SCC. To verify the genomic characteristics of pancreatic SCC, we employed in-solution hybrid capture targeting 137 cancer-related genes accompanied by high throughput sequencing (HTS) to compare the different genetic variants in SCC and AC of pancreas. We compared the genetic alterations of known biomarkers of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in different pancreatic cancer tissues, and identified nine mutated genes in SCC of pancreas: C7orf70, DNHD1, KPRP, MDM4, MUC6, OR51Q1, PTPRD, TCF4, TET2, and nine genes (ABCB1, CSF1R, CYP2C18, FBXW7, ITPA, KIAA0748, SOD2, SULT1A2, ZNF142) that are mutated in pancreatic AC. This study may have taken one step forward on the discovery of potential biomarkers for the targeted treatment of SCC of the pancreas.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality. C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin (ALB), globulin (GLB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have been identified as general parameters for systemic inflammatory response (SIR). Furthermore, these parameters are also associated with tumor development and metastasis. The present study aimed to investigate the predictive values of these SIR parameters in patients with resectable lung cancer. In total, 101 patients with resectable lung cancer were recruited in the present study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the median value of pre-treatment CRP, ALB, GLB, LDH, NLR or PLR values. The post-/pre-treatment ratios were defined as the ratio of pre-treatment blood parameter values and the corresponding values obtained following therapy. A ratio of \u22641.1 indicated that the values were not increased, while a ratio of >1.1 suggested that the values were increased following treatment. Patients with lower pre-treatment ALB levels had poorer overall survival (OS) rates, whereas GLB, LDH, CRP, NLR or PLR levels were not associated with outcomes. Whole course treatment (surgery combined with adjuvant chemotherapy) significantly increased the value of ALB, but decreased the value of NLR, whereas it had no effect on the values of LDH, CRP or PLR. Post-/pre-treatment LDH and PLR were associated with outcomes. Post-/pre-treatment ALB, GLB, CRP and NLR were not associated with outcomes. Multivariate analysis revealed that a low pre-treatment ALB level and increased post-/pre-treatment PLR were independent risk factors affecting OS. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that an ALB value of 47.850 g/l was considered to be the optimal cut-off value for prognosis; the sensitivity was 28.8% and specificity was 95.9%. It was suggested that the pre-treatment ALB and post-/pre-treatment PLR may be potential prognostic factors in resectable lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "The count and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) may be used as prognostic markers in certain types of cancer. The present study investigated the prognostic potential of the counts of WBCs, including lymphocytes (LYs), monocytes (MOs), neutrophils (NEs), eosinophils (EOs) and basophils (BAs), in the prognosis of resectable colorectal cancer. The present study recruited 153 resectable colorectal cancer cases retrospectively, which were pathologically confirmed. All patients were divided into two groups, according to the median value of LY (low LY, \u22641.632x109/l or high LY, >1.632x109/l), MO (low MO, \u22640.330x109/l or high MO, >0.330x109/l), NE (low NE, \u22643.600x109/l or high NE, >3.600x109/l), EO (low EO, \u22640.085x109/l or high EO, >0.085x109/l), BA (low BA, \u22640.010x109/l or high BA, >0.010x109/l), or WBC (low WBC, \u22645.780x109/l or high WBC, >5.780x109/l). To evaluate the alterations in WBC counts following surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy; all samples received oxiplatin and capecitabine (XELOX) for 6\u20118\u00a0cycles or 5\u2011fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) for 10\u201112\u00a0cycles. XELOX included oxaliplatin administered intravenously at a dose of 130\u00a0mg/m2 on day 1 and 850\u20111,250\u00a0mg/m2 capecitabine twice daily for days 1\u201114, repeated every 3\u00a0weeks. mFOLFOX6 included oxaliplatin administered intravenously at a dose of 85\u00a0mg/m2, 400\u00a0mg/m2 leucovorin and 400\u00a0mg/m2 5\u2011FU on day 1 followed by 1,200\u00a0mg/m2/days continuous infusion for 2\u00a0days (in total, 2,400\u00a0mg/m2 over 46\u201148\u00a0h), repeated every 2\u00a0weeks. The present study investigated the post/pre\u2011treatment of LY, MO, NE, EO, BA and WBC ratios (\u22641 indicated that LY, MO, NE, EO, BA and WBC counts were not increased following therapy; whereas, >1 suggested increased counts). Kaplan\u2011Meier curves were constructed to demonstrate overall survival (OS). A multivariate and univariate logistic regression analyses model was employed to identify the independent risk factors. Low pre\u2011treatment BA counts were associated with larger tumor size (>5\u00a0cm); pre\u2011treatment BA levels were positively associated with OS. Surgery significantly decreased the count of BAs and increased the count of EOs; whereas, no effect was observed on LYs, MOs, NEs or WBCs. Adjuvant chemotherapy markedly decreased the counts of LY, NE and WBC; whereas, no notable effects on MOs, EOs or BAs were observed. Whole course treatment (surgery combined with adjuvant chemotherapy) significantly decreased the values of LY, NE and WBC; however, increased the value of EO; no effects on the MO or BA counts were observed. An increased post\u2011/pre\u2011treatment NE ratio suggested poorer prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that sex, tumor size, pre\u2011treatment BA count and the post\u2011/pre\u2011treatment NE ratio were independent prognostic factors affecting OS. The results of the present study suggested that the pre\u2011treatment BA count and post\u2011/pre\u2011treatment NE ratio may be potential prognostic factors for resectable colorectal cancer.",

Methods: The expression level of mature miR-34a in breast cancer tissues (n = 93) and benign breast lesions (n = 5, as the control) was detected by TaqMan probe-based real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (TaqMan\u00ae MicroRNA Assay Kit). The bisulfite conversion and purification of genomic DNA from each formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded breast cancer samples were performed by EpiTect Fast FFPE Bisulfite Kit. The methylation status of miR-34a gene promoter in breast cancer samples was assessed by methylation-specific PCR. The relationship between miR-34a expression and miR-34a gene methylation was statistically analyzed. The prognostic value of miR-34a gene methylation was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curve. Results: The expression level of miR-34a in breast cancer was significantly lower than that in benign breast lesions (P = 0.006). The expression of miR-34a was negative correlated with tumor size (r = -0.312, P = 0.021), lymph node metastasis (r = -0.378, P = 0.004) and tumor grade (r = \uff0d0.341, P = 0.011). However, the expression of miR-34a was not associated with estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) (all P u003e 0.05). The level of mature miR-34a in unmethylated group was significantly higher than that in methylated/unmethylated group or methylated group (both P u003c 0.001). Compared with unmethylated group and methylated/unmethylated group, the recurrence-free survival (P u003c 0.001, P = 0.019) and overall survival (P = 0.002, P u003c 0.001) of patients with breast cancer were significantly reduced in miR-34a gene methylated group. Conclusion: In some patients with breast cancer, the methylation of miR-34a gene may lead to the down-regulation of mature miR-34a expression. Furthermore, the methylation status of miR-34a gene is associated with the risk of tumor recurrence and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer.  DOI:10.3781/j.issn.1000-7431.2016.33.687",

We evaluated the correlation between aberrant \u03b2-catenin pathway activation and the prognosis pancreatic cancer, and the potential of applying the \u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor FH535 to pancreatic cancer treatment. Meta-analysis and immunohistochemistry showed that abnormal \u03b2-catenin pathway activation was associated with unfavorable outcome. FH535 repressed pancreatic cancer xenograft growth  in vivo . Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of microarray data indicated that target genes responding to FH535 participated in stemness maintenance. Real-time PCR and flow cytometry confirmed that FH535 downregulated CD24 and CD44, pancreatic cancer stem cell (CSC) markers, suggesting FH535 impairs pancreatic CSC stemness. GO analysis of \u03b2-catenin chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data identified angiogenesis-related gene regulation. Immunohistochemistry showed that higher microvessel density correlated with elevated nuclear \u03b2-catenin expression and unfavorable outcome. FH535 repressed the secretion of the proangiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and also inhibited angiogenesis  in vitro  and  in vivo . Protein and mRNA microarrays revealed that FH535 downregulated the proangiogenic genes  ANGPT2, VEGFR3, IFN-\u03b3, PLAUR, THPO, TIMP1,  and  VEGF . FH535 not only represses pancreatic CSC stemness  in vitro , but also remodels the tumor microenvironment by repressing angiogenesis, warranting further clinical investigation.",

Raman measurements show that the crystallization process of a-Si:H sublayers strongly depends on die post-treatment process. RTA is advantageous for nucleation, in which the size of the nuclei increases with higher annealing temperatures, and the crystalline volume ratio increases with longer annealing times. In FA, however, higher temperatures are required for further crystallization such as increasing the grain size and crystalline volume ratio, The ultimate size of nc-Si grains can be accurately determined by the thickness of the a-Si:H sublayer. Moreover, the mechanism of the constrained crystallization will also be discussed in accordance with the thermodynamic theory.",

        "abstract": "A supramolecular polycatenane stabilized by outer surface interactions between cucurbit[6]uril (Q[6] or CB[6]) cations and [CdCl ] is reported. The arrangement of the poly-interlocked supramolecular framework is evidently constructed by a favorable combination of weak non-covalent interactions such as hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonding, ion-dipole interactions, and C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Cl interactions in the solid state. Further study suggests that such 3D poly-interlocked species could be rapidly precipitated from the mixture solution in high yield owing to electrostatic interaction of the [CdCl ] anion with the electropositive outer surface of Q[6] host. This work thus demonstrates a simple, low-cost, and efficient non-covalent approach for the construction of a infinite 3D interlocked structure in water besides through coordination or covalent bonds.",

X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis has revealed that the interaction of CyPQ[6] and a series of Lncations unexpectedly results in the formation of at least seven different CyPQ[6]-based coordination complex adduct and supramolecular assemblies groups, including with (1) La, Cecations; (2) Pr, Ndcations; (3) Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy with P1\u0305 or P1 space group, in which CyPQ[6] molecules coordinate alternatively with Lncations and form linear coordination polymers; (4) CyPQ[6] molecules interact alternatively with [Ho(HO)] aqueous complexes and form linear supramolecular chains; CyPQ[6] molecules can assemble two different Ln free porous supramolecular assemblies from CyPQ[6]-Ln(NO)-ZnCl-HCl systems, Ln = Tm, Yb, and Lu; however, no solid crystals were obtained from system containing Ercation. Thus, these differences could lead CyPQ[6] to be useful in not only the isolation of lighter lanthanides from their heavier lanthanides but also special selectivity for different volatile organic compounds.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cucurbit[ n ]urils (Q[ n ]s), a relatively new class of macrocyclic hosts with a rigid hydrophobic cavity and two identical carbonyl-fringed portals, have attracted much attention in supramolecular chemistry. Compared to the chemistry of cyclodextrins and calixarenes, the development of cucurbit[ n ]uril chemistry has been relatively slow, mainly due to the high chemical stability of Q[ n ]s, which makes them difficult to functionalize. The discovery of the direct oxidation method to yield perhydroxylated cucurbit[ n ]urils {(HO) 2   n  Q[ n ]s} greatly promoted Q[ n ] chemistry, since (HO) 2   n  Q[ n ]s can serve as a platform trigger for the synthesis of many other functionalized cucurbit[ n ]urils. The resulting products have attracted much attention for numerous potential applications. In this review, we summarize developments based on derivatives of cucurbit[ n ]urils hydroxylated at the \u201cequatorial\u201d positions, as well as the potential applications of these molecules.",

        "abstract": "The interaction of a series of lanthanide cations (Ln3+) with a di-hydroxylated symmetrical octamethyl-substituted cucurbituril {(OH)2OMeQ[6]} has been investigated. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis has revealed that the interaction results in the formation of adducts of (OH)2OMeQ[6] with aqua complexes of lanthanide cations ([Ln(H2O)8]3+), Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu in (OH)2OMeQ[6]\u2013Ln(NO3)3\u2013H2O systems. However, no solid crystals were obtained from systems containing La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm. X-ray diffraction analysis has revealed that although the solid adducts fall into two isomorphous groups, there are no significant differences in the interactions between (OH)2OMeQ[6] and [Ln(H2O)8]3+ complexes and in the corresponding supramolecular assemblies. Thermodynamic parameters for the interaction between (OH)2OMeQ[6] and [Ln(H2O)8]3+ complexes based on isothermal titration calorimetry experiments show two periods corresponding to the above two systems, with the lighter lanthanide cations preferring to remain in solution and the heavier lanthanide cations forming crystalline solids. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) has shown that the interaction of OMeQ[6] with lanthanide cations could provide a means of isolating heavier lanthanide cations from their lighter counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Polycrystalline samples La1\u2212x\n Ca\n x\n MnO3 (x=0.17, 0.15, 0.10) and La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 were prepared in order to investigate the Griffiths-like features induced by disorder compared with their counterpart single\n crystals. The magnetization data exhibit the traditional transition from ferromagnetic phase to paramagnetic phase. From the\n temperature dependence of inverse susceptibility, it can be testified that the Griffiths-like features still exist in as-prepared\n Ca doped samples, while non-Griffiths-like features exist in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. All these samples, however, exhibit the large effective spins resulting from formation of the short-order ferromagnetic\n clusters. The O K-edge X-ray absorption spectra indicate the Jahn\u2013Teller (J-T) distortions are definitely present due to the J-T ion Mn3+, which indicate that static J-T distortion is not a sufficient condition for the existence of Griffiths phase in Sr-doped\n system. And, the size of J-T distortion is a little larger in polycrystalline La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 than that in polycrystalline samples La1\u2212x\n Ca\n x\n MnO3 (x=0.17, 0.15, 0.10), revealed by X-ray diffraction parameters and extended X-ray fine structure absorption data of Mn K-edge. It also testifies that the disorder in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 caused by both chemical doping and J-T distortions is lower than that in polycrystalline samples La1\u2212x\n Ca\n x\n MnO3, which may be the reason of non-Griffiths-like phase existing in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 samples.",

        "abstract": "The Griffiths phase has been investigated in terms of oxygen vacancy in polycrystalline samples La0.75Ca0.15MnO3 (LCMO-1) and La0.75Ca0.15MnO3\u2212\u0394 (LCMO-2). The latter of the two samples is prepared by annealing the former (with existence of Griffiths phase) in N2 atmosphere. Experimental results demonstrate that for the latter sample Griffith\u2019s phase disappears (according to its obeying Curie\u2013Weiss law in the temperature dependence of inverse susceptibility) due to redistribution of magnetic disorder between Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions induced by the increment of crystal lattice structure parameters. XRD patterns of the two samples show an increase of crystal lattice structure parameters. X-ray absorption fine structure data manifest that the degree of structural disorder in LCMO-2 sample is higher than that of LCMO-1, indicating that local structural disorder in this system is not the key role to affect the existence of Griffiths phase, while magnetic distribution/disorder is an important character.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the distinctions in survival and toxicity between patients with cervical cancer with common iliac node or para-aortic node involvement, who were treated with extended-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (EF-IMRT) and patients with or without lower involved pelvic nodes, who were treated with pelvic IMRT. A total of 55 patients treated with EF-IMRT and 52 patients treated with pelvic IMRT at the Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients treated with EF-IMRT had the highest level of lymph node involvement to the para-aortic or common iliac nodes, while patients treated with pelvic IMRT had no para-aortic or common iliac nodes involved (P<0.001). The median follow-up time was 29.5 months. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates of EF-IMRT and pelvic IMRT were 79.4 and 82.3% (P=0.45), respectively, and the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates of EF-IMRT and pelvic IMRT were 61.0 and 73.7% (P=0.55), respectively. Cox's regression analysis revealed that EF irradiation was a protective prognostic factor for OS and DFS. A total of 16 patients in the EF-IMRT group and 13 patients in the pelvic IMRT group experienced treatment failure (P=0.67), with the patterns of failure being the same for the two groups (P=0.88). The cumulative incidence of grade 3 and 4 acute toxicities in the EF-IMRT group was 34.5%, in comparison with 19.2% in the pelvic group (P=0.048). The results of the present study suggest that patients with cervical cancer with grossly involved common iliac or para-aortic nodes should be electively subjected to EF irradiation to improve the survival and alter patterns of recurrence. Notably, EF irradiation delivered via IMRT exhibits an increased toxicity incidence, however, this remains within an acceptable range.",

        "abstract": " Brachytherapy (BT) is one of the techniques available for retreatment of patients with locally recurrent nasopharyng eal carcinoma (rNPC). In this study, we evaluated the treatment outcome and late toxicities of three-dimensional high-dose-rate brachytherapy (3D-HDR-BT) for patients with locally rNPC.  This is a retrospective study involving 36 patients with histologically confirmed rNPC from 2004 to 2011. Of the 36 patients, 17 underwent combined-modality treatment (CMT) consisting of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) followed by 3D-HDR-BT, while the other 19 underwent 3D-HDR-BT alone. The median dose of EBRT for the CMT group was 60 (range, 50-66) Gy, with an additional median dose of BT of 16 (range, 9-20) Gy. The median dose for the 3D-HDR-BT group was 32 (range, 20-36) Gy. The measured treatment outcomes were the 5- and 10-year locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and late toxicities.  The median age at recurrence was 44.5 years. The median follow-up period was 70 (range, 6-142) months. The 5-year LRFS, DFS, and OS for the entire patient group were 75.4, 55.6, and 74.3%, respectively, while the 10-year LRFS, DFS, and OS for the entire patient group were 75.4, 44.2, and 53.7%, respectively. The 10-year LRFS in the CMT group was higher than that in the 3D-HDR-BT-alone group (93.8 vs. 58.8%, HR: 7.595, 95%CI: 1.233-61.826,  = 0.025). No grade 4 late radiotherapy-induced toxicities were observed.  3D-HDR-BT achieves favorable clinical outcomes with mild late toxicity in patients with locally rNPC.",

        "title": "Characterization of eukaryotic DNA N6-methyladenine by a highly sensitive restriction enzyme-assisted sequencing",
        "abstract": "Although extensively studied in prokaryotes, the prevalence and significance of DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA or m6dA) in eukaryotes had been underappreciated until recent studies, which have demonstrated that 6mA regulates gene expression as a potential heritable mark. To interrogate 6mA sites at single-base resolution, we report DA-6mA-seq (DpnI-Assisted N6-methylAdenine sequencing), an approach that uses DpnI to cleave methylated adenine sites in duplex DNA. We find that DpnI cuts other sequence motifs besides the canonical GATC restriction sites, thereby expanding the utility of this method. DA-6mA-seq achieves higher sensitivity with nanograms of input DNA and lower sequencing depth than conventional approaches. We study 6mA at base resolution in the Chlamydomonas genome and apply the new method to two other eukaryotic organisms, Plasmodium and Penicillium. Combined with conventional approaches, our method further shows that most 6mA sites are fully methylated on both strands of DNA at various sequence contexts. DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) is the most prevalent DNA modification in prokaryotes but rare in eukaryotes1, 2. Only certain unicellular eukaryotic organisms, such as the green algae Chlamydomonas3 and the ciliate Tetrahymena4, have been known to possess detectable 6mA in the genomic DNA previously5. Benefiting from the latest developments of highly sensitive detection methods, recent studies have revealed the presence of 6mA in metazoans C. elegans6 and Drosophila7 in additional to green algae8, 9, as well as potential 6mA methyltransferases and demethylases, raising the possibility that 6mA may be more prevalent in eukaryotes1, 10. A latest study further reports discoveries of 6mA, albeit in very low abundances, in the genomes of vertebrates, highlighting the prevalence of 6mA in more extensive eukaryotes11. Besides modern mass spectrometry that can accurately quantify the amount of DNA modifications, next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides another powerful tool to gain crucial genome-wide distribution information of these DNA modifications12, 13. 6mA specific antibodies have been used to recognize and enrich 6mA-containing DNA fragments for sequencing studies6, 7. 6mA can be profiled by coupling immunoprecipitation (IP) with NGS. A quantitative map at single-base resolution with the modification percentage information is more desirable, however. Unfortunately, a bisulfite-treatment equivalent of deamination approach has yet to be developed for the sequencing of methylated adenines. Although single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing can distinguish 6mA from A and has been successfully applied in prokaryotes containing small-sized genomes14, 15, the relatively high expense and low throughput have prevented its wide applications in eukaryotic organisms with much larger genomes. Restriction\u2013modification systems are widely adopted in bacteria to resist phage infections16. Restriction enzymes specifically digest invading phage DNA while the host DNA is modified and resists digestion. In the co-evolutionary arm race between phages and bacteria, certain phages have evolved to modify their own DNA to escape restriction enzyme-based digestion; in response, certain bacteria have evolved to attack modified phage DNA17, 18, 19. Although restriction\u2013modification systems are not thought to exist in eukaryotes, collections of various restriction enzymes provide invaluable toolkits for the study of DNA modifications in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes20, 21. In our recent work, we reported a restriction enzyme-assisted sequencing approach to identify single 6mA sites in the genome of Chlamydomonas8. Two restriction enzymes, CviAII and DpnII, were introduced which cleave DNA at CATG and GATC sites, respectively, leaving methylated sites C(6mA)TG and G(6mA)TC intact22, 23. However, these two enzymes cannot distinguish fully methylated (symmetric methylation on double-stranded DNA) or hemi-methylated sites (only one strand is methylated), and incomplete digestion may generate false-positive methylation assignments because of the dominance of unmethylated restriction sites8. To control the false-positive rate, a minimal 10 \u00d7 whole-genome coverage of sequencing depth is usually necessary, leading to high costs in studies of large genomes. In the current study, we show that a 6mA-sensitive restriction enzyme, DpnI, preferentially cleaves duplex DNA at fully methylated sites24. With reduced sequencing depth, a new approach using DpnI obtains the equivalent 6mA map of Chlamydomonas at single-base resolution. Importantly, the new method requires much less starting material (as low as 10\u2009ng) and reduced sequencing cost, but achieves higher sensitivity, making it particularly suitable for characterizations of sites with relatively low 6mA abundances and processes with limited materials. In addition, DpnI not only recognizes a canonical GATC sequence motif, but also cleaves fully methylated double-stranded DNA at CATC/GATG sites (CATC and GATG are complementary to each other), which further expands the application scope of this method. By combining results using this new approach with previous data, we conclude that most 6mA sites in Chlamydomonas are fully methylated at various sequence contexts, further supporting the role of 6mA as an epigenetic mark in eukaryotes9. This method is particularly good for the study of low abundance 6mA sites because of its high sensitivity. We apply the method to two other eukaryotic organisms with relatively low 6mA abundance in genomic DNA (Plasmodium falciparum and Penicillium chrysogenum), and characterize 6mA distributions in the genomes of these organisms. Because DpnI is known to cut methylated G(6mA)TC, we envisioned a restriction enzyme-assisted, high-throughput sequencing approach to identify single 6mA sites genome-wide (Fig. 1a) and validated it using Chlamydomonas. Genomic DNA from log-phase sample cultured under constant light was extracted and purified. After treatment with DpnI, long DNA fragments were sonicated to ~300\u2009bp in length, and then a standard Illumina DNA library was constructed for NGS sequencing. After testing different amounts of input DNA, we were able to use as low as 10\u2009ng input DNA for the digestion step and subsequent library construction (Supplementary Fig. 1). The G(6mA)TC sites should be cleaved by DpnI, and represented as the reads ends in the sequencing output. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to interrogate the methylation status of each A at GATC context. To overcome the false-positive sites generated by random shearing, a binomial probability distribution was used to determine the cutoff of minimum read ends at GATC sites where the A site could be identified as 6mA while maintaining a false-positive rate below 1%; therefore, <1% of identified 6mA sites might be erroneously assigned. A parallel library was also constructed by using DpnII, which specifically cleaves unmethylated GATC sites (Fig. 1a). In total, we uncovered 92% GATC sites genome-wide, among which 2.3% were identified as methylated. We compared the identified sites to the 6mA map determined using the DpnII-assisted approach as described previously8, and found that at least 91% of sites agreed in two data sets (Fig. 1b). By aligning the single 6mA sites to gene loci, we found that >70% of these 6mA sites are located at promoters defined as \u22121\u2009kb to +1\u2009kb regions around transcription start sites (Fig. 1c). The periodic distribution pattern (Fig. 1d), a key feature of 6mA distribution associated with nucleosome positioning in the Chlamydomonas genome, was recapitulated8. DpnI efficiently cleaves G(6mA)TC sites based on previous reportes22, 24. However, our sequencing results have revealed cleavage of a large fraction of methylated non-GATC sites (Fig. 2a). Specifically, 76% of the identified 6mA sites are located in the CATC/GATG context while only 19% are located in the GATC context (Fig. 2b). This high proportion of non-GATC 6mA sites prompted us to confirm the cleavage of C(6mA)TC by DpnI in addition to G(6mA)TC. In fact, a previous report suggested that DpnI could also recognize motifs other than GATC (ref. 25). We synthesized oligonucleotides with 6mA site in the CATC/GATG context, and annealed them to form double-stranded DNA. After treatment with DpnI, the DNA probes with C(6mA)TC and G(6mA)TG motifs were explicitly cleaved at the 6mA site after 12\u2009h of incubation (Fig. 2c). As negative controls, double-stranded DNA probes containing unmethylated GATC or CATC were resistant to cleavage even with overnight incubation. Therefore, the non-GATC sites identified by DA-6mA-seq should be genuine 6mA sites. Indeed, these sites overlap very well with the previous 6mA map determined by using IP followed by sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 2a)8. We then inspected the genomic distribution of these non-GATC sites, and found that they were highly enriched at promoter regions (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Furthermore, these 6mA sites form a clear periodic pattern around transcription start sites, which is almost identical to the pattern of G(6mA)TC in the same genomic DNA (Fig. 2d). The remaining 5% of the 6mA sites are comprised of random sites (Supplementary Fig. 2c). We have previously identified C(6mA)TG sites in the Chlamydomonas genome8; DA-6mA-seq failed to identify these sites, however, showing the high specificity of DpnI to 6mA-methylated GATC and CATC/GATG sequences, which is consistent with the crystal structure of DpnI bound to duplex DNA25, 26. About 1.8% of all CATC/GATG sites were detected to be methylated across the Chlamydomonas genome, which is analogous to the percentage of 6mA in the GATC context. The methylated adenines occupy only a small fraction of all motifs in the genome, ruling out a possible methylation mechanism similar to that observed in bacteria, which methylates target loci based on the restriction sequence motif. On the other hand, the percentages of the methylated sites in these sequence contexts that we identified are consistently higher than random (6mA accounts for ~0.4% of the total adenines in the genome8), suggesting that these ApT centred sequences are favourably recognized by the methylation machinery. The previous approach using CviAII- or DpnII-assisted digestion cannot distinguish fully methylated and hemi-methylated sites since these two enzymes are hindered by both fully- or hemi- methylation8. To explore the sensitivity of DpnI to different methylation status, we synthesized single-stranded DNA probes with or without 6mA at specific sequence motifs, and annealed them to afford double-stranded DNA representing fully and hemi-methylated probes. Consistent with the previous report22, DpnI cleaves fully methylated DNA much faster than hemi-methylated DNA containing the GATC motif (Fig. 3a). Specifically, DpnI barely cleaved hemi-methylated CATC/GATG sites, even if the reaction time was excessively prolonged; fully methylated CATC/GATG sites were cleaved by overnight incubation, however (Fig. 3b). We treated the same batch of DNA with DpnI for 30\u2009min or 12\u2009h (overnight), and performed DA-6mA-seq in parallel. Both G(6mA)TC and C(6mA)TC/G(6mA)TG sites in the two data sets concurred (>90% overlapping, Supplementary Fig. 3). These results suggest that the vast majority of the 6mA sites identified by DA-6mA-seq are fully methylated. The additional ~500 6mA sites that were identified only by using DpnII-based digestion are most likely hemi-methylated8. Genome-wide analysis showed no preferences of these sites to promoters, exons or introns (Supplementary Fig. 3), and the abundances at each sites are low, which may indicate aberrant methylation or roles yet to be identified. Previous studies indicate the presence of 6mA in more extensive eukaryotes5, 10, 27, 28, 29, 30, including the human malarial parasite Plasmodium5 and the fungi Penicillium31. To validate the existence of 6mA in these other organisms, we employed liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) to quantify the 6mA abundance in four candidate organisms: Leishmania major, Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum and Penicillium chrysogenum8, 32, 33 (Fig. 4a); the genomes of Plasmodium and Penicillium were found to contain relatively abundant 6mA (~0.05\u20130.15% 6mA/A). We then applied DA-6mA-seq to map 6mA in the genomes of these two organisms. Surprisingly, the distribution patterns of 6mA in the genomes of Plasmodium and Penicillium are very different from that in Chlamydomonas. In Plasmodium, ~1/5 of GATC sites are extensively methylated all across the genome with methylated CATC or GATG detected at very low level (<1%; Fig. 4b). The extensive G(6mA)TC sites identified are inconsistent with the gross 6mA abundance of the genome. We reasoned that the methylation level of each site might be relatively low; in other words, only a small proportion of individual cells contain 6mA at specific sites, whereas other cells do not. To validate this speculation, we re-analysed the sequencing data and considered the randomly sheared reads overlapping with each GATC sites. If random reads are more than enzyme-digested reads, we defined the site as partially methylated (Fig. 4c). The ratio of random reads to enzyme-digested reads can also help to estimate the percentage of methylation at each specific site8. Under this definition, the majority of G(6mA)TC sites (97%) were methylated with a methylation percentage below 10% in Plasmodium (Supplementary Fig. 4a); in contrast, only 9% of G(6mA)TC sites were partially methylated in the Chlamydomonas genome, which is consistent with much lower 6mA abundance measured in the genome of Plasmodium than that in Chlamydomonas (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4a). The wide-spread G(6mA)TC sites are distributed randomly across the genome without any enrichment to gene context (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Far fewer 6mA sites were detected in the genome of Penicillium, corresponding to even lower 6mA abundances at individual sites. Similar to Plasmodium, most of the G(6mA)TC sites were partially methylated with a low percentage of methylation ratio (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In comparison, the DpnII-assisted approach detected very limited G(6mA)TC sites (~100 in Plasmodium and ~20 in Penicillium) in these two genomes (Supplementary Fig. 4c), presumably because of the low sensitivity of the DpnII-assisted approach to detect G(6mA)TC sites with low levels of methylation. The application of DA-6mA-seq in Plasmodium and Penicillium demonstrated high sensitivity of this method for studying genomes with low 6mA abundance. The uncovered distribution pattern of 6mA in the genomes of Plasmodium and Plasmodium may suggest complicated roles of 6mA in different organisms. Recent studies have revealed unique distribution patterns and potential biological significances of 6mA as a new epigenetic DNA mark in eukaryotes9. The genome-wide distributions of 6mA have been profiled in the genomes of C. elegans6, Drosohpila7 and Chlamydomonas8; however, the functional roles of 6mA in more extensive organisms remain largely unexplored10. IP-based methods require a large amount of input DNA, whereas single-molecule real-time sequencing is restricted to organisms with small genome sizes due to throughput and cost issues. Increasing body of evidence shows the presence of 6mA in early embryos of Drosohpila7 and vertebrates (unpublished data and correspondences), highlighting the urgency of new effective and economical sequencing methods to carry out large-scale studies. DA-6mA-seq takes advantage of the restriction enzyme, DpnI, which sensitively and specifically cleaves 6mA-containing motifs. DA-6mA-seq requires far fewer sequencing reads to obtain base-resolution information than previous methods, which significantly increases detection accuracy. The optimized procedure reduces the initial DNA amount to 10\u2009ng for standard library construction, while maintaining high sensitivity. DpnI is known to specifically cleave methylated GATC sites25, 26. Here we found that DpnI not only recognizes the canonical G(6mA)TC sites, but also cleaves C(6mA)TC or G(6mA)TG sites, which further expands the scope of its utility. DpnI could serve as a platform to engineer additional restriction enzymes that recognize other sequence motifs with modification. The wide-spread C(6mA)TC and G(6mA)TG sites in Chlamydomonas indicate that palindromic sequence is not a necessary factor to determine the target loci, suggesting a methylation system in eukaryotes distinct from those in prokaryotes34. DpnI only cleaves fully methylated sites in a limited time period; therefore, 6mA sites identified by DA-6mA-seq are symmetrically and fully methylated. In Chlamydomonas, the prevalence of symmetric methylated ApT suggests the presence of methyltransferase(s) working on hemi-methylated adenines, which faithfully maintains fully methylated status after DNA replication; it is also a hallmark of eukaryotic 5mC DNA methylation. In prokaryotes, methyltransferases recognize sequence motifs as target sites. We have shown that the majority of 6mA sites in the genome of Chlamydomonas occur at the core sequence ApT, without flanking sequence preference. Our results here confirmed the fully methylated nature of the majority of 6mA sites without the pre-requisite palindromic motif in Chlamydomonas. All of this evidence further indicates that 6mA is a heritable epigenetic mark in this organism. Limited by the detection method, the presence of 6mA in many eukaryotic organisms is controversial1, 5, 10. Mass spectrometry-based methods, although sensitive enough to detect the very low abundance of nucleotide modifications, can only provide the overall ratio of the modification in total DNA. In the case of 6mA, bacterial contaminations could easily confound the mass spectrometry signal. High-throughput sequencing coupled with bioinformatic analysis is a powerful strategy to assure eukaryotic origin and to reveal the distribution pattern of 6mA and other modifications35, 36, 37, 38. The DA-6mA-seq presented here is highly sensitive and requires only nanograms of input DNA, making it an ideal method to study low abundance 6mA sites as well as biological processes that yield only limited materials. We applied DA-6mA-seq to two selected eukaryotes, Plasmodium and Penicillium, both of which possess low 6mA abundances in their genomes. DA-6mA-seq effectively identified thousands of single 6mA sites, which not only confirms the wide-spread presence of 6mA, but also showcases the power of this new approach. DA-6mA-seq offers a highly sensitive, rapid, easy-to-use but low-cost method to investigate 6mA in more uncharacterized organisms or biological processes with limited materials. Chlamydomonas DNA was extracted from log-phase strain CC 1609 cultured in standard tris-acetate-phosphate medium at 25\u2009\u00b0C under constant light. Genomic DNA of Leishmania major, Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Cat. no. 30012D, 50174D, PRA-405D, respectively). Penicillium chrysogenum DNA was extracted by DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. no. 69104). Approximately 10\u2009ng purified genomic DNA was digested in 0.5h or 12\u2009h by using 20 U DpnI (NEB, Cat. no. R0176S). Digested DNA segments were further sheared by Bioruptor (Diagenode) to ~300\u2009bp. After purification by AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat. no. A63880), DNA segments were end-repaired, followed by 3\u2032-adenylation and adaptor ligation according to standard Illumina TruSeq DNA sample preparation procedures. Adaptor-ligated DNA segments were PCR amplified for 15 cycles, purified by AMPure XP beads and suspended in 20\u2009\u03bcl of resuspension buffer to yield the sequencing library. Quality control and concentration measurement were performed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 Chip and qPCR. Library was sequenced by using Illumina HiSeq 2500. After adaptor trimming and quality control, reads were aligned to reference genome (Cre4 for Chlamydomonas, PlasmoDB-24 for Plasmodium and Pench1 for Penicillium) by Bowtie39. The positions of 5\u2032 ends were analysed genome-wide as the potential DpnI cleavage sites (assigned as x). A binominal distribution model was assumed that each read could be randomly sheared and mapped with a probability P=1/gs (gs=genome size) or cleaved by DpnI. The total number of reads was assigned as n. The P value of each genomic locus with 5\u2032 reads ends was calculated as . The P-values were further corrected by Bonferroni correction, and FDR<0.01 was set as the cutoff to determine a real DpnI cleavage site. Oligonucleotides containing 6mA were prepared using Applied Biosystems 392 DNA synthesizer with phosphoramidites from Glen Research and purified following standard protocols. Oligonucleotides without 6mA were ordered from IDT. The sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The double-stranded DNA sequences were obtained by annealing single-stranded complementary oligonucleotides. Double-stranded DNA (10\u2009pmol) was digested by 20\u2009U\u2009DpnI for 30\u2009min or overnight. After the digestion reaction, the DpnI enzyme was heat-inactivated; then, the product mixture was separated by denaturing electrophoresis using Novex 15% TBE-Urea PAGE gel (Life Technologies, Cat. no. EC6885BOX) and visualized by Bio-Rad Molecular Imager PharosFX system. Genomic DNA was denatured and digested by nuclease P1 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no. N8630) in 10\u2009mM NH4OAc pH 5.3 at 42\u2009\u00b0C overnight. Then, 1\u2009\u03bcl of venom Phosphodiesterase I (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no. P3243) was added to further digest the DNA sample at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h. Finally, NH4HCO3 (1\u2009M, 2\u2009ml) was added which was followed by 1\u2009U of alkaline phosphatase from E. coli (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no. P5931). Before being uploaded into LC\u2013MS/MS, solution was diluted four times. The ratio of 6mA to A was calculated and normalized based on a standard curve, according to the detailed procedure described by Jia et al.32.

        "abstract": "Phenotypic differences within populations and between closely related species are often driven by variation and evolution of gene expression. However, most analyses have focused on the effects of genomic variation at regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers that control transcriptional activity, and little is understood about the influence of post-transcriptional processes on transcript evolution. Post-transcriptional modification of RNA by -methyladenosine (mA) has been shown to be widespread throughout the transcriptome, and this reversible mark can affect transcript stability and translation dynamics. Here we analyze mA mRNA modifications in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from human, chimpanzee and rhesus, and we identify patterns of mA evolution among species. We find that mA evolution occurs in parallel with evolution of consensus RNA sequence motifs known to be associated with the enzymatic complexes that regulate mA dynamics, and expression evolution of mA-modified genes occurs in parallel with mA evolution.",

        "abstract": "N-methyladenosine (mA) regulates mRNA metabolism and translation, serving as an important source of post-transcriptional regulation. To date, the functional consequences of mA deficiency within the adult brain have not been determined. To achieve mA deficiency, we deleted Mettl14, an essential component of the mA methyltransferase complex, in two related yet discrete mouse neuronal populations: striatonigral and striatopallidal. Mettl14 deletion reduced striatal mA levels without altering cell numbers or morphology. Transcriptome-wide profiling of mA-modified mRNAs in Mettl14-deleted striatum revealed downregulation of similar striatal mRNAs encoding neuron- and synapse-specific proteins in both neuronal types, but striatonigral and striatopallidal identity genes were uniquely downregulated in each respective manipulation. Upregulated mRNA species encoded non-neuron-specific proteins. These changes increased neuronal excitability, reduced spike frequency adaptation, and profoundly impaired striatal-mediated behaviors. Using viral-mediated, neuron-specific striatal Mettl14 deletion in adult mice, we further confirmed the significance of mA in maintaining normal striatal function in the adult mouse.",

Although mRNA mA modifications have been extensively studied and shown to play critical roles in many cellular processes, the identity of mA methyltransferases for rRNAs and the function of rRNA mA modifications are unknown. Here we report a new mA methyltransferase, ZCCHC4, which primarily methylates human 28S rRNA and also interacts with a subset of mRNAs. ZCCHC4 knockout eliminates mA4220 modification in 28S rRNA, reduces global translation, and inhibits cell proliferation. We also find that ZCCHC4 protein is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tumors, and ZCCHC4 knockout significantly reduces tumor size in a xenograft mouse model. Our results highlight the functional significance of an rRNA mA modification in translation and in tumor biology.",

        "abstract": "Nucleic acids carry a wide range of different chemical modifications. In contrast to previous views that these modifications are static and only play fine-tuning functions, recent research advances paint a much more dynamic picture. Nucleic acids carry diverse modifications and employ these chemical marks to exert essential or critical influences in a variety of cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms. This review covers several nucleic acid modifications that play important regulatory roles in biological systems, especially in regulation of gene expression: 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidative derivatives, and  N  6 -methyladenine (6mA) in DNA;  N  6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A), pseudouridine (\u03a8), and 5-methylcytidine (m 5 C) in mRNA and long non-coding RNA. Modifications in other non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA, miRNA, and snRNA, are also briefly summarized. We provide brief historical perspective of the field, and highlight recent progress in identifying diverse nucleic acid modifications and exploring their functions in different organisms. Overall, we believe that work in this field will yield additional layers of both chemical and biological complexity as we continue to uncover functional consequences of known nucleic acid modifications and discover new ones.",

        "abstract": "The main challenges of visual object tracking arise from the arbitrary appearance of the objects that need to be tracked. Most existing algorithms try to solve this problem by training a new model to regenerate or classify each tracked object. As a result, the model needs to be initialized and retrained for each new object. In this paper, we propose to track different objects in an object-independent approach with a novel two-flow convolutional neural network (YCNN). The YCNN takes two inputs (one is an object image patch, the other is a larger searching image patch), then outputs a response map which predicts how likely and where the object would appear in the search patch. Unlike the object-specific approaches, the YCNN is actually trained to measure the similarity between the two image patches. Thus, this model will not be limited to any specific object. Furthermore, the network is end-to-end trained to extract both shallow and deep dedicated convolutional features for visual tracking. And once properly trained, the YCNN can be used to track all kinds of objects without further training and updating. As a result, our algorithm is able to run at a very high speed of 45 frames-per-second. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm can also be proved by the experiments on two popular data sets: OTB-100 and VOT-2014.",

        "abstract": "Recently, discriminatively learned correlation filters (DCF) has attracted much attention in visual object tracking community. The success of DCF is potentially attributed to the fact that a large number of samples are utilized to train the ridge regression model and predict the location of an object. To solve the regression problem in an efficient way, these samples are all generated by circularly shifting from a searching patch. However, these synthetic samples also induce some negative effects which weaken the robustness of DCF based trackers. In this paper, we propose a new approach to learn the regression model for visual tracking with single convolutional layer. Instead of learning the linear regression model in a closed form, we try to solve the regression problem by optimizing a onechannel- output convolution layer with gradient descent (GD). In particular, the kernel size of the convolution layer is set to the size of the object. Contrary to DCF, it is possible to incorporate all \"real\" samples clipped from the whole image. A critical issue of the GD approach is that most of the convolutional samples are negative and the contribution of positive samples will be suppressed. To address this problem, we propose a novel objective function to eliminate easy negatives and enhance positives. We perform extensive experiments on four widely-used datasets: OTB-100, OTB-50, TempleColor, and VOT-2016. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performance and outperforms most of the existing DCF based algorithms.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we aim to build a robust correlation-based visual object tracking system. The function of traditional correlation filters for visual tracking is to search the most likely position of target by circularly shifting the search image patch. However, the search image patch needs to be large enough to cover both the object and background, which results in the algorithm being sensitive to changes in background. To alleviate this problem, we first propose an efficient object-surrounding histogram model to suppress the background. In this model, we build a Bayes classifier based on the initial given object, and we then apply it to each pixel in subsequent frames. With this model, the original image can be enhanced in order to eliminate the impact of circular shifting. Moreover, we develop a structural correlation filter that consists of both holistic and local object parts. The multiple object parts are adaptively weighted and further aggregated to predict the relative motion from the last frame. We conduct extensive experiments on frequently used benchmarks with 51 video sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performance, especially in terms of heavy occlusion and severe deformation.",

        "abstract": "Learning a large-scale regression model has proven to be one of the most successful approaches for visual tracking as in recent correlation filter (CF)- based trackers. Different from the conventional CF-based algorithms in which the regression model is solved based on circulant training samples, we propose learning linear regression models via a single-convolutional layer with the gradient descent (GD) technique. In our convolution-based approach, the samples are cropped from an image in a sliding-window manner rather than being circularly shifted from one base sample. As a result, the abundant background context in the images can be fully exploited to learn a robust tracker. The proposed tracker is based on two independent regression models: a holistic regression model and a texture regression model. The holistic regression model is trained based on the entire object patch to predict the object location, whereas the texture regression model is trained based on the local object textures. The foreground map outputted by the texture regression model is not only helpful to boost the location prediction in the case of large variations, but is also an important clue for estimating the object size. With the foreground map outputted by the texture regression model, we are able to estimate the object size by optimizing a novel objective function based on object-background contrast. Our extensive experiments on four popular visual tracking datasets OTB-50, OTB-100, VOT-2016, and TempleColor have proved that the proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performance and outperforms most CF-based trackers.",

The SCC crack growth rate under SCW environments can be regarded as the cracking induced by the combined effect of corrosion and creep, while the  CGR  in inert gas environment can be taken as the portion of creep induced cracking. Results showed that the CW Alloy 690 sustained high susceptibility to intergranular (IG) cracking, and creep played a dominant role in the SCC crack growth behavior, contributing more than 80% of the total crack growth rate at each testing temperature. The temperature dependence of creep induced  CGR s follows an Arrhenius dependency, with an apparent activation energy ( Q  E ) of about 225\u00a0kJ/mol.",

The results show that the weight gain curves of AFA and ODS 316 SS follow near-parabolic law. Both AFA and ODS 316 SS show higher corrosion resistance in SCW than normal 316 SS, which is because that Al-Cr rich oxide and Cr-rich oxide layer are formed on AFA and ODS 316 SS, respectively. The corrosion process and mechanism of AFA and ODS 316 SS are discussed.",

The wear behavior of alloy 690 steam generator (SG) tube fretting against AISI 405 stainless steel, and exposed to 285\u202f\u00b0C water and argon, was investigated using a fabricated apparatus. Compared with argon, high temperature water contributes to the removal of wear particles and the formation of oxide scale on the wear scar. Fretting promotes tribo-corrosion of alloy 690 in high temperature water and that results in the formation of a stable oxide scale. That oxide scale on the wear scar reduces the wear coefficient of the material and progressively changes the wear mode from one of delamination to one dominated by abrasion.",

Results showed that in-situ sensitization and creep occurred on the specimens during the SCC tests in SCW environment. Higher degree of Cr-depletion at the grain boundary ahead of the SCC crack tip was identified in the Fe- 25 Cr steel specimen, which has suffered severer in-situ sensitization because of the lower Cr content than the Ni- 29.3 Cr alloy specimen, and this in turn increased the creep susceptibility.",

Experimental results indicated that stress intensity factor  K , loading ratio, and frequency control the CGRs of materials along with corrosion potential, chloride, and pH also significantly influencing the cracking behavior. Similar CGRs under various conditions were observed in the base metal and its weld, with low SCC susceptibility in hydrogenated water, but high SCC susceptibility in oxygenated water. The weld metal showed lower SCC CGRs than base metal in oxygenated high purity water but shifted to higher values after adding ppb levels of chloride because of the presence of \u03b4-ferrite in the weld.",

Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) are conducted on the cross-section of the surface oxide film, revealing a double-layered structure. Results from SSRT tests at 600\u202f\u00b0C show an intergranular fracture mode, and SCC susceptibility of 310-ODS steel increases with the increasing of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. SSRT tests at 650\u202f\u00b0C show ductile fracture mode, and SCC susceptibility is minimum. ODS enhances the yield strength of 310-ODS steel to over 480\u202fMPa, tensile strength to over 750\u202fMPa, and still keeps elongation rate to over 12% at 600\u202f\u00b0C.

The corrosion resistances of candidate materials (including ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steel, austenitic stainless steel, alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steel and oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steel) in supercritical water are discussed and analyzed. High Cr content austenitic stainless steel, proper Cr content AFA stainless steel and ODS steel are promising cladding materials for SCWR since they generally have satisfactory corrosion resistance even in 650\u202f\u00b0C SCW.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to provide references for designing boilers with separated over-fire air (SOFA), numerical simulation was applied for studying the effect of SOFA on temperature, heat flux and fuel combustion in a 3\u00a0MW pilot-scale facility. Simulation results agrees well with measureable data. Results show the temperature and the sensible heat flux of the flue-gas at the furnace outlet first decrease, and then increase with the excess air ratio in the combustion zone. As the SOFA ports rises, the temperature and the sensible heat flux of flue-gas decrease at the furnace outlet. These variations are caused by variations of the sensible heat flux of air injected into furnace. Moreover, as the SOFA ratio increases, both the total heat flux from furnace walls and the fuel combustion heat decrease. The maximum decrease of the heat flux from furnace walls occupies 10% of the total in the case without SOFA. The maximum decrease of the fuel combustion heat occupies 8% of the total, which is caused by the unburnt carbon in bottom ash. The SOFA position has little influence on the total heat flux and the fuel combustion heat. These results are valuable for designing boilers with SOFA.",

Based on the water wall structure and heat flux distribution of the SCFB boiler, the connection style, pressure drop, mass flux, metal temperature, and phase transition position in water wall were optimally selected and numerically analyzed. The calculation results show that the minimum deviation of mass flux among water wall presents at connection style 1, in which outer-front wall, outer-left (right) wall, inner-front wall, and inner-left (right) wall are connected to the same steam-water separator. The gravitational pressure drop decreases while the frictional pressure drop increases with the rise of fluid temperature. Moreover, vertical upward parallel tubes present positive flow response characteristic with low mass flow rate. The subcooled length and superheated length shrink while the saturated length expands with the reduction of partial loads.",

The simulation results show that the fuel type exhibits certain effect on the temperature distributions and the NO  x   emissions. Moreover, higher excess air ratio could restrain the CO formation but promote NO  x   emission. The temperature and the species distributions are highly related to the SOFA arrangement. In addition, SOFA technology is still an effective approach to control the NO  x   emissions during blended coal combustion, while the disadvantageous effect on char burnout should be considered.",

We apply broad-band ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy to resolve the evolution of fluorescence spectra for dilute solutions of conjugated oligothiophenes, where no energy transfer is possible. Fluorescence spectra evolve from a mirror image of absorption, which lacks vibronic structure, toward a spectrally narrower and vibronically structured species on the hundreds of femtosecond to early picosecond time scale. Our analysis of this fluorescence spectral evolution shows that a broad distribution of torsional conformers is driven to rapidly planarize in the excited state, including in solid films, which is supported by Raman spectroscopy and quantum chemical modeling. Our data have important implications for understanding different energy-transfer regimes that are delineated by structural relaxation. ",

        "abstract": "Relative to electron donors for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs), electron acceptors that absorb strongly in the visible and even near-infrared region are less well developed, which hinders the further development of OSCs. Fullerenes as traditional electron acceptors have relatively weak visible absorption and limited electronic tunability, which constrains the optical and electronic properties required of the donor. Here, high-performance fullerene-free OSCs based on a combination of a medium-bandgap polymer donor (FTAZ) and a narrow-bandgap nonfullerene acceptor (IDIC), which exhibit complementary absorption, matched energy levels, and blend with pure phases on the exciton diffusion length scale, are reported. The single-junction OSCs based on the FTAZ:IDIC blend exhibit power conversion efficiencies up to 12.5% with a certified value of 12.14%. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that exciting either the donor or the acceptor component efficiently generates mobile charges, which do not suffer from recombination to triplet states. Balancing photocurrent generation between the donor and nonfullerene acceptor removes undesirable constraints on the donor imposed by fullerene derivatives, opening a new avenue toward even higher efficiency for OSCs.",

        "abstract": "A polymer fibril assembly can dictate the morphology framework, in forming a network structure, which is highly advantageous in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). A fundamental understanding of how to manipulate such a fibril assembly and its influence on the BHJ morphology and device performance is crucially important. Here, a series of donor-acceptor polymers, PBT1-O, PBT1-S, and PBT1-C, is used to systematically investigate the relationship between molecular structure, morphology, and photovoltaic performance. The subtle atom change in side chains is found to have profound effect on regulating electronic structure and self-assembly of conjugated polymers. Compared with PBT1-O and PBT1-S, PBT1-C-based OSCs show much higher photovoltaic performance with a record fill factor (FF) of 80.5%, due to the formation of optimal interpenetrating network morphology. Such a fibril network strategy is further extended to nonfullerene OSCs using a small-molecular acceptor, which shows a high efficiency of 12.7% and an FF of 78.5%. The results indicate the formation of well-defined fibrillar structure is a promising approach to achieving a favorable morphology in BHJ OSCs.",

        "abstract": "Following the introduction of perovskites for photovoltaic solar energy conversion, the use of these materials as a general purpose opto-electronic material for displays, lighting and lasing has been explored. However, while reports on stimulated emission and lasing by perovskites show great promise, a comprehensive quantification of their optical gain characteristics is lacking. Here, we measure gain coefficients, clarify the gain mechanism, and explore the gain dynamics of colloidal cesium lead bromide nanocrystals by deploying a unique combination of broadband transient absorption and ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy. Opposite from current literature, we show that optical gain in such nanocrystals is supported by stimulated emission from free carriers, and not from excitons or bi-excitons. Importantly, we demonstrate that the concomitant gain coefficients and thresholds agree with literature results reported for perovksite thin films. Finally, we show that, even in the case of fully inorganic lead halide perovskites, a cooling bottleneck hampers the development of net stimulated emission at high excitation density. Based on these results, we propose that bulk-like colloidal nanocrystals in general offer a unique testbed to quantify optical gain of novel photonic materials and in particular for lead halide perovskites.",

The FREA-perovskite hybrid films exhibit larger grain sizes and stronger crystallinity than the pristine perovskite films. Moreover, the FREA molecules can form coordination bonding with undercoordinated Pb atoms and passivate the trap states in the perovskite films. Time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements reveal that FREA facilitates efficient electron extraction and collection. Transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements suggest faster charge transfer and reduced charge recombination in solar cells based on FREA-perovskite hybrid films. Consequently, solar cells based on FREA-perovskite hybrid films yield a champion efficiency of 21.7% with enhanced stability, which is higher than that of the control devices based on pristine perovskite films (19.6%).",

Understanding of these processes in hybrid perovskites has advanced, but remains incomplete. Using femtosecond transient absorption and photoluminescence, it is observed that the luminescence signal shows a rise over 2 ps, while initially hot photogenerated carriers cool to the band edge. This indicates that the luminescence from hot carriers is weaker than that of cold carriers, as expected from strongly radiative transitions in direct gap semiconductors. It is concluded that the electrons and holes show a strong overlap in momentum space, despite recent proposals that Rashba splitting leads to a band offset suppressing such an overlap. A number of possible resolutions to this, including lattice dynamics that remove the Rashba splitting at room temperature, and localization of luminescence events to length scales below 10 nm are considered.",

Here we present unique insights into the processes leading to photon emission in these materials. We employ ultrafast broadband photoluminescence (PL) and transient absorption spectroscopies to directly link density dependent ultrafast charge dynamics to PL. We find that exceptionally strong PL at the band edge is preceded by thermalization of free charge carriers. Short-lived PL above the band gap is clear evidence of nonexcitonic emission from hot carriers, and ultrafast PL depolarization confirms that uncorrelated charge pairs are precursors to photon emission. Carrier thermalization has a profound effect on amplified stimulated emission at high fluence; the delayed onset of optical gain we resolve within the first 10 ps and the unusual oscillatory behavior are both consequences of the kinetic interplay between carrier thermalization and optical gain.

We present a new method, transient grating photoluminescence spectroscopy (TGPLS), that addresses this challenge by exploiting a focusing geometry where ultrafast broadband spectra are transiently diffracted away from the background PL. We show that TGPLS can resolve the complex spectral relaxation observed in conjugated polymer and oligomer solutions, with an essentially flat spectral response throughout the visible region and potentially beyond. The benefits we demonstrate using TGPLS could expand access to spectral information, particularly for other multichromophoric and heterogeneous materials where complex spectral relaxation is expected.

        "abstract": "Modest exciton diffusion lengths dictate the need for nanostructured bulk heterojunctions in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, however, this morphology compromises charge collection. Here, we reveal rapid exciton diffusion in films of a fused-ring electron acceptor that, when blended with a donor, already outperforms fullerene-based OPV cells. Temperature-dependent ultrafast exciton annihilation measurements are used to resolve a quasi-activationless exciton diffusion coefficient of at least 2 \u00d710-2 cm2 / s - substantially exceeding typical organic semiconductors, and consistent with the 20-50 nm domain sizes in optimized blends. Enhanced 3-dimensional diffusion is shown to arise from molecular and packing factors; the rigid planar molecular structure is associated with low reorganization energy, good transition dipole moment alignment, high chromophore density, and low disorder - all enhancing long-range resonant energy transfer. Relieving exciton diffusion constraints has important implications for OPVs; large, ordered, and pure domains enhance charge separation and transport, and suppress recombination, thereby boosting fill factors. Further enhancements to diffusion lengths may even obviate the need for the bulk heterojunction morphology.",

        "abstract": "Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials have received much attention in the past years for a wide variety of photonic applications because of their pronounced room-temperature excitonic features, leading to unique properties in terms of light-matter interaction. However, only a few studies focus on light amplification and the complex photophysics at high excitation density. The beneficial nature of strong excitonic effects on optical gain remain hence unquantified, and despite the increased binding energies of the excitonic species, it remains unclear what the involvement of 2D excitons would be in optical gain. Here, we use colloidal CdSe nanoplatelets as a model system for colloidal 2D materials and show, using a quantitative and combinatory approach to ultrafast spectroscopy, that several excitation density-dependent optical gain regimes exist. At low density, optical gain originates from excitonic molecules delivering large material gains up to 20 000 cm  -1  with an Auger limited lifetime of a few hundred picoseconds. At increasing pair density, we observe a persistence of this excitonic gain regime and the unexpected coexistence of blue-shifted and significantly enhanced optical gain up to 10  5  cm  -1  . We show that this peculiar situation originates from a carrier cooling bottleneck at high density that limits further exciton formation from unbound charge carriers. The insulating (multi-)exciton gas is found to coexist with the conductive phase, indicating the absence of a full Mott transition. Our results shed a new light on the photophysics of excitons in strongly excited 2D materials and pave the way for the development of more efficient (broadband) optical gain media and/or high exciton density applications.",

        "abstract": "We show that optical gain in 2D CdSe colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) shows little saturation and co-exists with exciton absorption over a broad range of excitation densities, in stark contrast with 0D CdSe colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). In addition, we demonstrate that photo-excited CQWs can absorb or emit light through the thermodynamically driven formation or radiative recombination of singlet excitonic molecules. Invoking stimulated emission through the molecule-exciton transition, we can quantify all the remarkable gain characteristics of CQWs using only experimentally determined parameters, an advance that highlights a fundamental difference between multi-excitons in CQWs and CQDs. While strong confinement prohibits the dissociation of multi-excitons into separate excitons in 0D CQDs, excitons and excitonic molecules coexist in a 2D CQW at room temperature, with densities governed by an association/dissociation equilibrium, not by state-filling. Our finding points out future directions to optimize stimulated emission by excitonic 2D materials in general.",

SF as measured by the decay of S1 has been shown to occur efficiently and independently of temperature, even when the energy of S1 is as much as 200\u2005meV less than that of 2T1. Here we study films of triisopropylsilyltetracene using transient optical spectroscopy and show that the triplet pair state (TT), which has been proposed to mediate singlet fission, forms on ultrafast timescales (in 300\u2005fs) and that its formation is mediated by the strong coupling of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. This is followed by a slower loss of singlet character as the excitation evolves to become only TT. We observe the TT to be thermally dissociated on 10\u2013100\u2005ns timescales to form free triplets. This provides a model for \u2018temperature-independent\u2019 efficient TT formation and thermally activated TT separation. Download references",

        "abstract": "We have developed a new method, transient grating photoluminescence spectroscopy (TGPLS), allowing the collectionof broadband ultrafast photoluminescence spectroscopy with low photoluminescence background. In TGPLS, twoultrafast laser pulses generate a multiplexed transient grating (TG) by the optical Kerr effect. The gated signal isdiffracted by the TG and spatially separated from background fluorescence. This high performance nonlinear optical gatedelivers time resolution less than 200 fs, spectral bandwidth covering the entire visible region with extremely lowfluorescence background. Here we present two applications of TGPLS that provide deeper insight into ultrafast energytransfer in multi-chromophore perylene arrays and ultrafast structural relaxation in oligothiophenes.",

But can we assume that these materials are in the strong confinement regime? Here, we report an ultrafast transient absorption study of cubic CsPbBr3 NCs as a function of size, compared with the bulk material. For NCs above \u223c7 nm edge length, spectral signatures are similar to the bulk material\u2013characterized by state-filling with uncorrelated charges\u2013but discrete new kinetic components emerge at high fluence due to bimolecular recombination occurring in a discrete volume. Only for the smallest NCs (\u223c4 nm edge length) are strong quantum confinement effects manifest in TA spectral dynamics; focusing toward discrete energy states, enhanced bandgap renormalization energy, and departure from a Boltzmann statistical carrier cooling. At high fluence, we find that a hot-phonon bottleneck effect ...",

        "abstract": "It is commonly believed that excess PbI2 has beneficial effects for perovskite solar cells owing to the modification of charge-transport behavior at interfaces, by surface passivation and by blocking electron-hole recombination. Here, we introduce a dynamically dispensed spin-coating technique in a two-step deposition to form a perovskite layer with controllable quantities of crystalline PbI2. Using this technique, the concentration of CH3NH3I solution is kept constant at the reaction interface, ensuring smooth growth of films. By changing the spinning rate during the reaction, the PbI2 conversion ratio and perovskite cuboid size can be optimized, resulting in a power conversion efficiency improvement over control devices. This dynamically dispensed technique represents a repeatable method for compositional control in perovskite solar cells and improves our understanding of how a PbI2 blocking layer improves the performance of perovskite solar cells.",

SF as measured by the decay of S1 has been shown to occur efficiently and independently of  even when the energy of S1 is as much as 200 meV less than 2T1. Here, we study films of TIPS-tetracene using transient optical spectroscopy and show that the initial rise of the triplet pair state (TT) occurs in 300 fs, matched by rapid loss of S1 stimulated emission, and that this process is mediated by the strong coupling of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. This is followed by a slower 10 ps morphology-dependent phase of S1 decay and TT growth. We observe the TT to be thermally dissociated on 10-100 ns timescales to form free triplets. This provides a model for temperature independent, efficient TT formation and thermally activated TT separation.",

Here we present a new class of size-, composition-, and shape-tunable nanocrystals made from Tl3PbX5 (X= Cl, Br, I). These can be synthesized via colloidal methods to produce faceted spheroidal nanocrystals, and perovskite TlPbI3 nanowires. Crystal structures for the orthorhombic and tetragonal phase materials, for both pure and mixed halide species, are compared to the literature and also calculated from first-principles in VASP. We show the ability to tune the band gap by halide substitution to create materials that can absorb strongly between 250 and 450 nm. In addition, we show evidence of the confinement effect in pure halide Tl3PbBr5 nanocrystals suggesting size-tuning is possible as well. By tuning the band gap we can create materials with specific absorption spectra suitable for photodetection that display conduction and photoresponse pro...",

TR exhibits full miscibility with PTB7-Th and efficient energy transfer to PTB7-Th, enhances stacking of PTB7-Th, hole mobility and charge generation of the blends, and ultimately improves device performance. Compared with the binary PTB7-Th/FOIC blend, the ternary device with 25% TR (w/w) yields simultaneously improved open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density and fill factor. Finally, single-junction OSCs based on the ternary PTB7-Th/TR/FOIC blend yield power conversion efficiency as high as 13.1%, higher than the binary OSCs (12.1%). The ternary device efficiency exhibits high tolerance to thickness variation (u003e12% in the range of 80\u2013200 nm). Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms the importance of long-range resonant energy transfer from donor to acceptor phases.",

        "abstract": "Multichromophore perylene arrays were designed and synthesized to have extremely efficient resonance energy transfer. Using broadband ultrafast photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopies, transfer timescales of approximately 1 picosecond were resolved, corresponding to efficiencies of up to 99.98%. The broadband measurements also revealed spectra corresponding to incoherent transfer between localized states. Polarization resolved spectroscopy was used to measure the dipolar angles between donor and acceptor chromophores, thereby enabling geometric factors to be fixed when assessing the validity of F\u00f6rster theory in this regime. F\u00f6rster theory was found to predict the correct magnitude of transfer rates, with measured \u223c2-fold deviations consistent with the breakdown of the point-dipole approximation at close approach. The materials presented, along with the novel methods for quantifying ultrahigh energy transfer efficiencies, will be valuable for applications demanding extremely efficient energy transfer, including fluorescent solar concentrators, optical gain, and photonic logic devices.",

Compared with homogeneous catalysts, MOF catalysts can be easily recycled and reused for several times; while compared with traditional heterogeneous catalysts, they possess tunable size and catalytic centers via exchange or modification of their components. This review will sketch typical successful MOF-catalyzed reactions and summarize various catalytic centers, including the open metal sites, bifunctional acid-base sites in MOFs, as well as catalytic centers introduced to MOFs via PSM. The periodic order and site isolation of the catalytic struts in MOFs eliminate the multimolecular catalyst deactivation pathways to extend the catalytic centers\u2019 functional lifetime and facilitate the studies of their activities and reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, detailed discussion on how the catalytic centers play the roles in the catalytic reactions and how to control the activity and selectivity of them will be given via typical reported examples.",

In this work, the organic ligand 2-(4-((E)-2-(pyridine-2-yl)vinyl)styryl)pyridine (2-bpeb), which possesses a large \u03c0-conjugated system was employed to react with d10 metal ions to obtain novel luminescent coordination polymers. Three complexes [Cd(2-bpeb)0.5(CNA)(H2O)] (CP1), [Cd(2-bpeb)0.5(NDC)] (CP2) and [Zn(2-bpeb)(BDC)] (CP3) were synthesized successfully by introducing carboxylic acids of 4-carboxycinnamic acid (H2CNA), 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid (H2NDC) and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) as auxiliary ligands. Because of the existence of the large \u03c0-conjugated system and d10 metal ions, all of these coordination polymers exhibit striking fluorescence properties. Impressively, all of them can function as sensors for detection of high oxidizing anions MnO4- and Cr2O72- and they have more sensitivity for MnO4-.",

        "title": "Mannan-Binding Lectin Attenuates Inflammatory Arthritis Through the Suppression of Osteoclastogenesis.",
        "abstract": "Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a vital element in the host innate immune system, which is primarily produced by the liver and secreted into the circulation. Low serum level of MBL is reported to be associated with an increased risk of arthritis. However, the underlying mechanism by which MBL contributes to the pathogenesis of arthritis is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the precise role of MBL on the course of experimental murine adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). MBL-deficient (MBL) AIA mice showed significantly increased inflammatory responses compared with wild-type C57BL/6 AIA mice, including exacerbated cartilage damage, enhanced histopathological features and high level of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells. MBL protein markedly inhibited the osteoclast formation from human blood monocytes induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) . Mechanistic studies established that MBL inhibited osteoclast differentiation  down-regulation of p38 signaling pathway and subsequent nuclear translocation of c-fos as well as activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1) pathway. Importantly, we have provided the evidence that concentrations of MBL correlated negatively with the serum levels of amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (\u03b2-CTX), serum markers of bone turnover, in patients with arthritis. Our study revealed an unexpected function of MBL in osteoclastogenesis, thus providing new insight into inflammatory arthritis and other bone-related diseases in patients with MBL deficiency.",

Despite their importance and much effort devoted to quantifying them, significant inconsistencies in the reported values for the same given material exist. We report a self-consistent method to quantify both \u03b8 and \u03bb of nonmagnetic materials by spin pumping with various ferromagnetic (FM) pumping sources. We characterize the spin-charge conversion for Pt and Pd with various FM combinations using (i) effective spin-mixing conductance, (ii) microwave photoresistance, and (iii) inverse spin Hall effect measurements and find that the pumped spin current suffers an interfacial spin loss (ISL), whose magnitude varies for different interfaces. By properly treating the ISL effect, we obtained consistent values of \u03b8 and \u03bb for both Pt and Pd regardless of the ferromagnet used.",

        "abstract": "We theoretically study magnon transport in an insulating spin valve (ISV) made of an antiferromagnetic insulator sandwiched between two ferromagnetic insulator (FI) layers. In the conventional metal-based spin valve, the electron spins propagate between two metallic ferromagnetic layers, giving rise to giant magnetoresistance and spin transfer torque. Here, the incoherent magnons in the ISV serve as angular momentum carriers and are responsible for the angular momentum transport between two FI layers across the antiferromagnetic spacer. We predict two transport phenomena in the presence of the temperature gradient: a giant magneto-spin-Seebeck effect in which the output voltage signal is controlled by the relative orientation of the two FI layers and magnon transfer torque that can be used for switching the magnetization of the FI layers with a temperature gradient of the order of 0.1 Kelvin per nanometer.",

Degradation patches are extracted from other documents and applied to the target document in the gradient domain. Working in the gradient domain has not been done for this purpose in document images analysis so far. It has the advantage to prevent color inconsistencies and allows to efficiently avoid border effects. This paper contains the detailed description of our novel method, with a focus on the mathematical aspect of the transition to and from the gradient domain. Furthermore, we perform quantitative experiments where we investigate the effects of using synthetically generated training data on historical documents with different kind of degradations.",

We consider page segmentation as a pixel-labeling problem, i.e., each pixel is assigned to one of a set of labels. Features are learned from pixel intensity values with stacked convolutional autoencoders in an unsupervised manner. The features are used for the purpose of initial classification with a multilayer perceptron. Then a CRF model is introduced for modeling the local and contextual information jointly in order to improve the segmentation. For the purpose of decreasing the time complexity, we perform labeling at superpixel level. In the CRF model, graph nodes are represented by superpixels. The label of each pixel is determined by the label of the superpixel to which it belongs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that, compared to previous methods, the proposed method achieves more accurate segmentation results and is much faster.",

The immobilized pectinase was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Immobilization conditions were optimized by Box-Behnken design and the response surface method. The activity of the immobilized pectinase prepared under optimal conditions reached 1236.86\u202f\u00b1\u202f40.21 U/g, with an enzyme activity recovery of 83.5%. The optimal pH of free pectinase was 4.5, while that of immobilized pectinase was shifted to 4.0. The optimal temperature of immobilized pectinase was increased to 60\u202f\u00b0C, which was 10\u202f\u00b0C higher than that of free form. Furthermore, the immobilized pectinase possessed a superior thermal stability and storage stability to those of free pectinase. Reusability studies indicated that the immobilized pectinase retained 73% of initial activity after six times cycles. Due to these good properties, such immobilized pectinase may find application in food industry.",

Their iron chelating ability was demonstrated by UV/Visible spectrometry and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The iron binding affinities were also investigated by the competition with a fluorescent iron chelator CP691. The result indicated that these dendrimers possesses a high affinity for iron with a very high pFe value, which is close to that of an isolated hexadentate unit. These dendrimeric chelators were found to exhibit inhibitory effect on the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.",

        "abstract": "Bovine pancreatic lipase was immobilized onto N-succinyl-chitosan beads by using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2032-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) as the activating agent. The immobilized lipase was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra and scanning electron microscopy. The activity of the immobilized lipase obtained under the optimized immobilization conditions was found to reach 1,480 U/g, with enzyme activity recovery of 74.5%. Compared to the free lipase, thermal stability of the immobilized lipase was greatly improved. The reusability study indicated that the immobilized lipase retained 76.6% of its initial activity after being recycled five times. A preliminary study indicated that the prepared immobilized lipase can effectively enrich the polyunsaturated fatty acid in fish oil (increasing from 45.1 to 67.7%), of which the combined docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid contents increased from 16.3 to 27.1%.Practical applicationsTo overcome the drawbacks of using free lipase, an effective method was developed by immobilization of lipase onto N-succinyl-chitosan beads using EDC/NHS as the activating agent. The immobilized lipase prepared by this method may find application in the enrichment of polyunsaturated fatty acids of fish oil.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to explore the potential of a novel tyrosinase inhibitor, namely the hydroxypyridinone derivative (5-hydroxy-1-octyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-2-carbaldehyde O-ethyl oxime, HPO), for shrimp preservation, six bacterial isolates from shrimp ( Penaeus vannamei ) (S1, S2, S3, S5, S6 and S7) were investigated. These bacteria were identified as  Shewanella amazonensis ,  Shewanella haliotis ,  Microbacterium oxydans ,  Photobacterium damselae ,  Staphylococcus haemolyticus  and  Bacillus cereus . The antimicrobial effect of HPO on these bacteria was evaluated by an inhibition zone test, together with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays. The results indicated that HPO possessed a stronger inhibitory effect than kojic acid. The antioxidant activity of HPO was evaluated by determining its 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and superoxide anion radical scavenging ability. The preservation effect on shrimp ( Penaeus vannamei ) of HPO was assessed by determining the quality indicators of the shrimp during the storage, including total bacterial count, pH value, total basic volatile nitrogen content, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and by sensory evaluation. It was found that treatment of shrimp with HPO effectively extended the shelf life to 10 days at 4\u202f\u00b0C. In the same assay, the shelf life of shrimps treated with 4-hexylresorcinol, kojic acid, and the control group was found to be 10, 6, and 4 days, respectively. The treatment of shrimps with HPO in combination with 0.1% citric acid further extended its shelf life to 12 days. Clearly, HPO could be applied as a shrimp preservative due to its potent anti-browning, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.",

Instability of synthesised crystals will degrade the properties of the photoelectrical device constructed by such perovskites. MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 in cubic crystal structure have been demonstrated to be the most stable at room temperature. Herein we synthesised MA(EA)PbI3 and FA(MA)PbI3 single crystals using an inverse-temperature crystallization strategy by partially substituting the methylammonium (MA) with ethylammonium (EA) and the formamidinium (FA) with methylammonium (MA) respectively. The XRD results show that both crystal structures are cubic, which means organic incorporation can stabilize the crystal structure of lead halide perovskites. The lattice distortion decrease and strain relaxation in single crystals were considered to be the reason leading to higher stability. The single crystals of MA(EA)PbI3 and FA(MA)PbI3 with low trap state density exhibit excellent light-absorbing properties, indicating their potential applications in photoelectric devices.",

The fabricated device exhibits a typical rectification behavior in dark and excellent photovoltaic characteristics under 365 nm and 254 nm light illumination. The device shows an extremely high responsivity of 54.43 mA W\u22121, a fast decay time of 0.08 s, a high Ilight/Idark ratio of 152 and a high detectivity of 1.23 \u00d7 1011 cm Hz1/2 W\u22121 under 365 nm light with a light intensity of 1.7 mW cm\u22122 under zero bias. Such excellent performances under zero bias are attributed to the rapid separation of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs driven by built-in electric field in the interface depletion region of GaN/Ga2O3 p\u2013n junction.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The metastable cubic  \u03b3  phase Ga 2 O 3  with a defect spinel structure presents several fascinating properties, which may be a more attractive material than the stable  \u03b2  form. Herein, we found that the metastable  \u03b3 -Ga 2 O 3  can be stabilized by copper (Cu) doping through a simple operation and low cost method of sol-gel. The  \u03b3 -Ga 2 O 3  thin films were prepared under the annealing of 700\u00a0\u00b0C in nitrogen atmosphere for Cu doping. The  \u03b2  phase Ga 2 O 3  ones were obtained at the same condition without the Cu dopant. While the Cu doped  \u03b3  phase Ga 2 O 3  will transform to  \u03b2  phase for a high annealing temperature above 800\u00a0\u00b0C. The grain size of Cu doped  \u03b3 -Ga 2 O 3  and undoped  \u03b2 -Ga 2 O 3  thin films increases with the increase of the annealing temperature. The UV\u2013Vis absorption spectrum of the  \u03b2 -Ga 2 O 3  thin film exhibits a sharp intrinsic absorption edge at \u223c250\u00a0nm, whilst Cu doped  \u03b3 -Ga 2 O 3  thin film displays an obvious red-shift. The band gap decreases from 4.90\u00a0eV to 4.38\u00a0eV for the Cu doping. The photoluminescence intensity at the ultraviolet and blue region of Cu doped  \u03b3- Ga 2 O 3  thin films are stronger than undoped  \u03b2 -Ga 2 O 3 , which can be attributed to the introduction of more defects such as oxygen vacancies in  \u03b3  phase by Cu doping.",

Herein, the monoclinic \u03b2-Ga2O3 NRAs with an average diameter/length of 500 nm/1.287 \u03bcm were prepared by the hydrothermal and post-annealing method.

This study established a modified protocol for intervertebral disc (IVD) decellularization and prepared its extracellular matrix (ECM). By culturing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)(3, 7, 14 and 21 days) and human degenerative IVD cells (7 days) in the ECM, implanting it subcutaneously in rabbit and injecting ECM microparticles into degenerative disc, the biological safety and efficacy of decellularized IVD was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrated that cellular components can be removed completely after decellularization and maximally retain the structure and biomechanics of native IVD. We revealed that allogeneic ECM did not evoke any apparent inflammatory reaction in vivo and no cytotoxicity was found in vitro. Moreover, IVD ECM can induce differentiation of MSCs into IVD-like cells in vitro. Furthermore, allogeneic ECM microparticles are effective on the treatment of rabbit disc degeneration in vivo. In conclusion, our study developed an optimized method for IVD decellularization and we proved decellularized IVD is safe and effective for the treatment of degenerated disc diseases. ",

        "abstract": "Combined intravenous and local intrathecal administration of meropenem in patients after craniotomy is widely used to treat intracranial infections. However, the optimal dosing regimen of meropenem has not been investigated, posing a risk to treatment efficacy. We aimed to identify significant factors associated with inter-individual variability in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pharmacokinetics of meropenem and to evaluate potential intravenous and intrathecal meropenem dosing regimens for the treatment of patients with intracranial infections. After the diagnosis of intracranial infection, 15 patients with an indwelling drain tube received intravenous and intrathecal administration of meropenem. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained at the scheduled time to measure meropenem concentration. Plasma and CSF concentration-time data were fit simultaneously using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. A 3-compartmental model was selected to characterize the in vivo behavior of meropenem. Through population modeling, multiple covariates were tested about their impact on the meropenem pharmacokinetics. Considering CSF outflow via drain tube leading to a drug loss, the drug clearance in CSF (CL) was added to describe this drug loss. The covariate selection indicated that the drainage volume (mL/d) had a significant positive correlation with CL. Bootstrap and visual predictive check suggested a robust and reliable pharmacokinetic model was structured. The established final population model was useful to apply with simulation to identify meropenem dosing regimens for the treatment of patients with intracranial infections. With the goal of CSF concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration during the therapy, we created a simple to use dosage regimen table to guide clinicians with drug dosing.",

        "abstract": "For the purpose of SO2 reduction and stabilizing ice wine, a new antibacterial technique was developed and verified in order to reduce the content of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and simultaneously maintain protein stability during ice wine aging process. Hazardous bacterial strain (lactic acid bacteria, LAB) and protein stability of Italian Riesling ice wine were evaluated in terms of different amounts of lysozyme, SO2, polyphenols, and wine pH by single-factor experiments. Subsequently, a quadratic rotation-orthogonal composite design with four variables was conducted to establish the multiple linear regression model that demonstrated the influence of different treatments on synthesis score between LAB inhibition and protein stability of ice wine. The results showed that, synthesis score can be influenced by lysozyme and SO2 concentrations on an extremely significant level (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Furthermore, the lysozyme-combined antibacterial system, which is specially designed for ice wine aging, was optimized step by step by response surface methodology and ridge analysis. As a result, the optimal proportion should be control in ice wine as follows: 179.31\u00a0mg L(-1) lysozyme, 177.14\u00a0mg L(-1) SO2, 0.60\u00a0g L(-1) polyphenols, and 4.01 ice wine pH. Based on this system, the normalized synthesis score between LAB inhibition and protein stability can reach the highest point 0.920. Finally, by the experiments of verification and comparison, it was indicated that lysozyme-combined antibacterial system, which was a practical and prospective method to reduce SO2 concentration and effectively prevent contamination from hazardous LAB, can be used to stabilize ice wine during aging process.

        "abstract": "In order to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) level in ice wine making, the effects of low SO2, lysozyme and oligomeric proanthocyanidin (OPC) on the volatile compounds were, respectively, studied during 1 year aging process. Based on the previous study, seven treatments of Italian Riesling ice wine were carried out for monitoring the evolution of volatile compounds. Results of gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that, about 180 mg/L SO2 not only increased total alcohols content in Italian Riesling ice wine, but also significantly correlated with certain higher alcohols during 1 year aging process. Meanwhile, the final concentration of medium-chain fatty acid ethyl esters and the corresponding fatty acids were found highly related to lysozyme adding. Moreover, OPC played a positive role in stabilizing the total content of esters at a level around 200 mg/L, it mainly due to its excellent ability of free oxygen scavenging. Finally, principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to reclassify major volatile compounds and 14 typical volatile components were defined.Practical ApplicationThis article was technically supported by our previous research: Development of lysozyme-combined antibacterial system to reduce sulfur dioxide and to stabilize Italian Riesling ice wine during aging process and mainly studied three volatile compounds evolution (alcohols, acids and esters) in Italian Riesling ice wine during 1 year aging process. It not only illustrated SO2 can not be totally replaced after alcohol fermentation because of its extraordinary contribution on alcohols and esters composition, but also indicated an appropriate range of SO2 addition (180\u2013200 mg/L) contributes to the synthesis of fruity and floral bouquet for aging. On the other hand, the addition of lysozyme and OPC not only improved the activity of LAB inhibition and antioxidant for ice wine aging, but also promoted certain esters evolution, which contributed more complexities for ice wine bouquet. It further proved the utilization of our system can be very promising and beneficial for reducing SO2 concentration and stabilizing Italian Riesling ice wine during aging process.",

        "abstract": "Li-ion-conducting solid electrolytes can simultaneously overcome two grand challenges for Li-ion batteries: the severe safety concerns that limit the large-scale application and the poor electrolyte stability that forbids the use of high-voltage cathodes. Nevertheless, the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes is typically low, compromising the battery performances. Precisely determining the ionic transport mechanism(s) is a prerequisite for the rational design of highly conductive solid electrolytes. For decades, the research on this subject has primarily focused on the atomic and microscopic scales, where the main features of interest are unit cells and microstructures, respectively. Here, it is shown that the largely overlooked mesoscopic scale lying between these extremes could be the key to fast ionic conduction. In a prototype system, (Li0.33La0.56)TiO3, a mesoscopic framework is revealed for the first time by state-of-the-art scanning transmission electron microscopy. Corroborated by theoretical calculations and impedance measurements, it is demonstrated that such a unique configuration maximizes the number of percolation directions and thus most effectively improves the ionic conductivity. This discovery reconciles the long-standing structure\u2013property inconsistency in (Li0.33La0.56)TiO3 and also identifies mesoscopic ordering as a promising general strategy for optimizing Li+ conduction.",

It is found that the reaction mechanism of the LLZO formation is as follows: 7Li 2 O+3La 2 O 3 +4ZrO 2 =2Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 . The LLZO phase forms at about 680 \u00b0C according to the XRD patterns, which is in agreement with the thermic peak at 700 \u00b0C in DTA/TG curves, and the peak arises from the formation of LLZO phase. The temperature range of stable LLZO phase is wider, from 720 to 1000 \u00b0C. However, LLZO is thermally unstable at the high temperatures ( 2 Zr 2 O 7 . And the amount of the decomposed products increases, and LLZO decreases gradually with the increase of the calcination temperature. When the reactant mixture is calcined at low temperature, the produced phases are identified to be lanthanum compounds because La 2 O 3  absorbs moisture and CO 2  very easily. The chemical reactions at lower temperature are mainly related with the reactions among lanthanum compounds. LLZO powder could be synthesized by solid state reaction at 800 \u00b0C. It is found that the LLZO crystal belongs to the tetragonal symmetry. SEM observation shows that the obtained LLZO powder is nano-sized.",

        "abstract": "Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) FEZF1-AS1 was demonstrated to facilitate cell proliferation and migration in some cancers.However, the functions of FEZF1-AS1 and its molecular mechanism in osteosarcoma remain to be elucidated. In our study, we found that the expression of FEZF1-AS1 was up-regulated in osteosarcoma samples and cell lines compared with normal tissues or cells. Besides, we showed that the expression levels of FEZF1-AS1 in osteosarcoma patients were positively correlated with tumor metastasis and TNM stage. Additionally, FEZF1-AS1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in U2OS and MG63 cells, and vice versa in vitro. Moreover, FEZF1-AS1 depletion inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. In mechanism, we found that FEZF1-AS1 sponged miR-4443 to promote NUPR1 expression in U2OS and MG63 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-4443 abrogated FEZF1-AS1 silence-induced inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion in osteosarcoma. Finally, we found that restoration of NUPR1 rescued the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of FEZF1-AS1-depleted U2OS and MG63 cells. In collection, our study indicated that FEZF1-AS1 could promote osteosarcoma progression by sponging miR-4443 to promote NUPR1 expression. The FEZF1-AS1/miR-4443/NUPR1 axis may act as a novel therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma treatment.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS After exclusion, 63 patients were enrolled in this study: 20 patients were classified into the emergency group (group A, within 24 h after injury), 26 into the early surgery group (group B, from 4 to 14 days after injury), and 17 into the delayed surgery group (group C, more than 14 days after injury). All patients underwent the same approach, and elbow motion and complication rates were recorded and compared. RESULTS Fifty-eight patients were followed up (mean 20.5\u00b11.9 months), and 5 patients had lost partial final data. At 1 month after the operation, elbow motion in group A was higher than in group B and group C (P<0.01); however, 3 or more months later, there was no distinct difference between group A and group B (P>0.05), while both group A and group B showed better outcomes than group C at all time points (P<0.05). Moreover, group A and group B had better higher elbow motion, MEPS, excellent and good rate than group C at the final clinical visit (all P<0.05). No postoperative pain or complication rate differences were found among the 3 groups except for elbow stiffness (2 in group A, 3 in group B, and 7 in group C) (P<0.05) which required reoperation to enhance elbow function.

Moreover, group A and group B had better higher elbow motion, MEPS, excellent and good rate than group C at the final clinical visit (all P<0.05). No postoperative pain or complication rate differences were found among the 3 groups except for elbow stiffness (2 in group A, 3 in group B, and 7 in group C) (P<0.05) which required reoperation to enhance elbow function. CONCLUSIONS Emergency or early operation for TTE patients were more effective than delayed operation.",

However, the traditional mathematical model of PMSM cannot absolutely reflect the reason of torque ripple and variation on the different operation performance of the motor for HEV. The purpose lies in the fact that electromagnet factor originated torque ripple and variation have been taken into account in the mathematic model of PMSM. Based on the classical Parku0027s transformation theory and the Fourier series analysis of magnetic field, a general nonlinear mathematical model of PMSM considering saturation and magnetic field spatial harmonics and time harmonics is presented in this paper. The general analytical model cannot only taking into account the variation of electromagnetic parameters caused by electric vehicle operating, but also can explain the frequency and the order of torque ripple theoretically. The modelu0027s effectiveness is tested through finite element analysis simulations and some experimental results. The analytical model presented here can be used for the characteristic analysis, the drive system dynamic precise analysis and fault diagnose of PMSM for HEV.",

There is much significant electro-mechanical coupling phenomenon in the mechanical installations. The aim of this paper is the analytical study of a planetary gearbox by using the stator current signature analysis in the PMSM based on the electro-mechanical coupling mechanism. This paper proposes a mathematical framework based on the electro-mechanical coupling model of the PMSM-planetary gearbox system, considering the load torque oscillation and the time-varying mesh stiffness. The model simulation result shows that from the mathematical framework, the load torque oscillation frequency and the time-varying mesh stiffness frequency can be predicted through the current frequency. The proposed mathematical model is verified by the model simulation. And a test-bed based on a 60\u00a0kW three-phase PMSM connected to a planetary gearbox has been used. Fourier transform is applied to the demodulated torque signal and current signal for denoising and removing the intervening neighbouring features.",

In this study, we analyzed the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the electromechanical coupling system. First, considering the electromechanical coupling effect of the system, differential equation of the system was obtained by combining the Park equation of a permanent-magnet synchronous motor with the rotor dynamics equation. Then, the coordinate plane projection method was used to analyze the chaotic phenomenon of the electromechanical coupling system. Through calculating the weight value of the 10 projection planes of the electromechanical coupling system, four projection planes with smaller weight values were chosen. Finally, the analysis of the four projection planes of the system indicated that the whole system could reach to the stable state by only controlling the rotational speed in the steady state.

The effects of pH and CSAD polymer concentration on the self-assembled behavior and particle size of CSAD were investigated by fluorescence measurement (FM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). In the presence of Ca, the cholesteryl-grafted sodium alginate derivative was used for fabricating self-assembled nanoparticles that can effectively encapsulate the drug acetamiprid. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The encapsulation efficiency (EE) and acetamiprid drug release behavior from the nanoparticles were also studied. The results reveal that CSAD self-assembled nanoparticles had a diameter of 100nm and were nonaggregated in aqueous media; Moreover, the encapsulation efficiency and the release behavior of nanoparticles were influenced by the MW of CSAD. The mechanism of acetamiprid release was found to vary from non-Fickian (anomalous) to Fickian transport with a decrease in the molecular weight of CSAD.",

Compared with pristine SiO-x, modified SiO-x is more sensitive to pH. Three stable liquid paraffin-in-water emulsions were prepared with Alg-SiO2-1, Alg-SiO2-2, and Alg-SiO2-4. Alg-SiO-2 exhibited satisfactory emulsification ability. The emulsions became more stable as emulsion pH varied from 2.0 to 6.2 because of polymer chain interactions that led to the formation of a three-dimensional network. When the emulsion pH varied from 6.2 to 8.0, the particle charge increased, in turn increasing interparticle the electrostatic interactions that increased emulsion stability. When the emulsion pH was 9.0, the subsequent decrease in particle charge, decreased the emulsion stability. The model drug \u03bb-cyhalothrin was embedded in the emulsions. A sustained-release assay demonstrated that increasing emulsion pH from 3.0 to 8.0 decreased cumulative drug release from the emulsion from 99.7% to 13.5%. This result indicated that the emulsion is a pH triggered drug delivery system. The sustained-release curves of \u03bb-cyhalothrin are describable by the Weibull model.",

        "abstract": "Amphiphilic polymers that form self-assembled structures in aqueous media have been investigated and used for the diagnosis and therapy of various diseases, including cancer. In our work, a series of environment-sensitive hydrophobic alginates (Ugi-Alg) with various weight-average molecular mass values (Mw~6.7\u00d710-6.7\u00d710g/mol) were synthesized via Ugi reaction. The structure of Ugi-Alg was characterized by HNMR spectrometer. The electrostatic self-assembly of different molecular weight (Mw) and composition (M/G ratio) of Ugi-Alg chain under various Na concentrations, was investigated by dynamic light scattering, electron spin resonance experiments, and transmission electron microscopy. Result showed that by comparing to other Ugi-Alg, the mid-Mw Ugi-Alg (Mw~2.8\u00d710g/mol) could form stable and homogeneous nanoparticles in low Na concentration solution. However, G/M values exerted no obvious effect on nanoparticles structure. Additionally, steady-shear flow, thixotropy and dynamical viscoelasticity tests were performed to characterize the rheological behavior of Ugi-Alg aqueous solutions as influenced by Mw and M/G ratio. All of the samples exhibited a non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior above a critical shear rate (\u03b3\u0307). The greater the Mw, the more sensitive the temperature-dependent behavior will be. The upward-downward rheograms showed that all of the systems evaluated in this study displayed a hysteresis loop, indicating a strong thixotropic behavior, and the thixotropic of mid-Mw Ugi-Alg was the strongest. The dynamical viscoelastic properties were characterized by oscillatory frequency sweep, revealing the gel-like viscoelastic behavior of mid-low Ugi-Alg and the fluid-like viscoelastic behavior of high-Mw Ugi-Alg.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sono-photo-Fenton, sono-Fenton and photo-Fenton methods combined with heterogeneous TiO 2  nanoparticles are adopted to investigate the degradation of sodium alginate (NaAlg), and the kinetics mechanism is also explored. Experimental results suggest that the reaction order of NaAlg degradation ( n ) is 0.51 and the extent of photocatalytic degradation can increase with the loading of TiO 2  nanoparticles. Meanwhile, as the catalyst concentration increases from 0.05 to 0.5\u00a0gL \u22121 , the degradation rate constant ( k ) is decreased. In addition, the structure of degraded NaAlg is characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR),  1 H NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses. The FT-IR and  1 H NMR spectra results indicate that the C2-C3 bond in the structure of NaAlg is broken and intra-molecular esters are formed during the degradation process due to the strong oxidization of the Fenton system. In general, the sono-photo-Fenton process with TiO 2  nanoparticles could provide an efficient way to degrade the NaAlg to low-molecular-weight.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Four different surface fractal dimensions ( D sf  \u2019s) of anisotropic silica (SiO 2 -x) similar in size were synthesized by layer-by-layer molecular imprinting strategy. Grafting was confirmed by FT-IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface and interfacial properties of particles were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption, dynamic light scattering, and contact-angle measurement. Results showed that  D sf   \u2019s of SiO 2 -1, SiO 2 -2, SiO 2 -4, and SiO 2 -6, were 2.47, 2.55, 2.62, and 2.56, respectively. Moreover, the modified silica shape varied from spherical to anisotropic particle, and particle hydrophobicity decreased with increased the  D sf  . Stable emulsions were prepared by these particles. The effects of particle concentration, hydrophobicity, and  D sf   on the formation, stability, and rheology of emulsions were investigated using an optical microscopy and rheometer. Optical microscopy images showed that unmodified silica failed to form stabilized emulsions due to excellent hydrophility, and particles with  D sf   = \u00a02.62 and 0.2\u00a0wt% concentration were the best for stabilized emulsions. Moreover, increased  D sf   led to decreased droplets size smaller and easier network formation. Rheology measurement further showed that increased  D sf   led to increased viscoelasticity and thermal stability of emulsions due to the formation of rigid volume-filling networks. This finding indicated that the particle fractal structure strongly affected the structures in the suspension to immobilize the emulsion droplets in these networks. Emulsion also exhibited longer \u03bb-cyhalothrin release speed with increasing  D sf   using \u03bb-cyhalothrin as model hydrophobic drug. The \u03bb-cyhalothrin release kinetics well-fitted the Weibull model.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a pH-responsive amphiphilic alginate (Ugi-Alg) was synthesized via Ugi reaction without using a catalyst. The structure of Ugi-Alg was confirmed by FT-IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Amphiphilic alginate can form micelles in an aqueous medium due to itu0027s amphiphilic nature.. The impacts of Na+ concentration and pH on the micelle size were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The dynamic light scattering observations showed that micelle size increases with the decrease in Na+ concentration in aqueous solution. However, the micelle size decreases first and then increases as the pH value decreases from 5.3 to 2.0. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the mean size of micelles is 30\u2013200 nm. In addition, a model hydrophobic pesticide (acetamiprid) was loaded in the micelles. The encapsulation efficiency and release behavior of micelles were studied, which could be controlled by Na+ concentration and pH. The results indicated that encapsulation efficiency of acetamiprid increases from 55% to 96% due to the increase in Na+ concentration from 0.01 M to 0.3 M. Moreover, with the decrease in pH from 5.3 to 2.0, encapsulation efficiency increases from 55% to 80%. Furthermore, the data of acetamiprid release kinetics could be well-fitted by the Weibull model.",

Results showed that DGP and CSAD exhibit competitive adsorption behaviour at the water\u2013gas interface and that this competitive behaviour can be intensified by NaCl. EPR revealed that the cholesterol groups of CSAD participate in the formation of micellar structures. The steric effect of the cholesterol groups reduces the microviscosity of the micellar structure, but high-concentration NaCl can weaken the polarity and increase the microviscosity of the formed micellar structure. In addition, at a high DGP concentration, high-concentration NaCl can facilitate DGP precipitation; this condition causes abnormal phenomena of surface tension, fluorescence spectroscopy, and EPR. For the emulsion system, analysis of particle size and rheology indicated that DGP and CSAD form a network structure between oil and water interfaces through interaction and thus enhance the non-Newtonian fluid properties of the emulsion. Owing to the competitive adsorption between CSAD and DGP at the oil\u2013water interface, DGP gradually replaces CSAD with the increase in DGP concentration. With a further increase in DGP concentration, the stable steric effect of polymers between oil drops may disappear, and oil drops may aggregate mutually.",

The shear-stress transport turbulence model was used and the numerical model was validated by comparison with experimental results for jet impingement heating with hot water at supercritical pressures. Radial conduction in the jet impingement plate was also considered. The sharp variations of the thermal-physical properties of the fluid near the pseudocritical point significantly influence heat transfer on the target wall. For a given heat flux, the high specific heat near the wall for the proper inlet temperature and pressure maximizes the average heat transfer coefficient.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Jet impingement cooling is widely used due to its high heat transfer rates, especially within the stagnation region. Jet impingement cooling by supercritical pressure fluids has even higher heat transfer coefficients with the proper working conditions than regular fluids with no burnout. This paper presents a numerical investigation of supercritical pressure carbon dioxide jet impingement cooling of a low thermal conductivity plate. Predictions of 11 RANS turbulence models were first validated against the published experimental data done by our research group. The effects of the inlet temperatures and pressures on the heat transfer were studied numerically for a wide range of heat fluxes with the flow phenomena observed in the experiment further explained by the numerical results. The SST  k - \u03c9  and Transition SST models gave more accurate predictions of the average heat transfer coefficient with differences of less than 15% for the validated case. The maximum average heat transfer coefficient occurred when the inlet temperature was lower than and the surface temperature was slightly higher than the pseudocritical temperature. The maximum average heat transfer coefficient increased with increasing inlet temperature when the inlet temperature was lower than the pseudocritical temperature and decreased with increasing pressure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Jet impingement cooling with carbon dioxide at supercritical pressures on micro pin fin structured surfaces was studied experimentally to enhance the impingement cooling heat transfer. The effects of the microstructure, mass flow rate and heat flux on the heat transfer were studied using the MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) based silicon chips for heating and simultaneous surface temperature measurement. The pressure was 7.85\u202fMpa, which is higher than the critical pressure of carbon dioxide of 7.38\u202fMPa. The jet inlet temperature was 19.0\u202f\u00b0C, which is lower than the pseudocritical temperature of 33.78\u202f\u00b0C at 7.85\u202fMPa. The mass flow rates were 14.4\u202fkg/h and 20.7\u202fkg/h with the heat flux varying from 0.01 to 0.35\u202fMW/m 2 . The results showed that the surface area increased by the micro structured surfaces was the major reason for heat transfer enhancement with the circular pin fins giving greater heat transfer enhancement than the square pin fins with the same total surface area. The high specific heat fluid layer near the cooled surface at supercritical pressures enhanced the heat transfer rate with the average heat transfer coefficient first increasing with increasing heat flux and then decreasing with further increases in the heat flux.",

The cross-sectional view from the numerical result agrees well with the experimental observations. The material distribution at different plunge depths calculated by the model illustrates the formation of the hook during the welding process. The force and thermal history generated by the numerical work also correspond well with the experimental data. A force history generated through a tool with a smaller shoulder diameter is studied to further validate the model. The developed model can be useful for better understanding the effect of the welding tool on FSSW and optimization of the tool geometry.",

After that, the tool travels along a circular path to refill the original keyhole. The process is applied for joining aluminum alloy 6061 to Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel. It increases the joint strength by 56.33% compared with that of conventional FSSW joints. A ductile failure mode is observed. The process can be implemented in any universal CNC machine and needs only one simple FSSW tool. An additional pure circular path welding process shows the enhanced performance of the keyhole refilled FSSW joints relies on three bonding mechanisms: the refilled original keyhole, the increased bonding area between steel and aluminum as well as the hook structure generated from the regular FSSW process. Three distinct layers of grain structures can be observed on the hook, which reveal the material flow pattern during the process.",

        "abstract": "Due to the security and privacy-preserving requirements from cloud computing platforms, it is sometimes desired that the video content is accessible in encrypted form. Reversible data hiding in the encrypted domain has gained increasing attention, as it can perform data hiding in encrypted medias without decryption which preserves the confidentiality of the content. In this paper, an efficient reversible data hiding scheme for encrypted H.264/AVC videos is proposed. During H.264/AVC encoding, the intra-prediction mode (IPM), motion vector difference (MVD), and the sign bits of residue coefficients are encrypted using a standard stream cipher. Then, every two adjacent coefficients are grouped into coefficient pairs. Based on the resulting coefficient pairs, the data-hider may reversibly embed secret data into the encrypted H.264/AVC video by using two-dimensional histogram modification. In addition, dynamic threshold is utilized to determine the embedding region. With an encrypted video containing hidden data, data extraction can be carried out either in encrypted or decrypted domain. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to design a time-controlled pulsatile release (TCPR) system containing propranolol (PNH) as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Here, the developed dosage forms were coated with hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) and other excipients as barrier layer using dry-coated technology. The influence of HPMC, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), and lactose in the outer coating and the coating weight on drug release were investigated. Then, a three-factor, five-level central composite design (CCD) and response surface method were used to optimize the formula of the coating. After data processing, the optimal prescription was found to be as follows: HPMC E50(X) 86.2\u00a0mg, MCC(X) 43.8\u00a0mg, and lactose (X) 21.3\u00a0mg in the coating. Moreover, the in vitro tests showed that the optimized formulation of TCPR had a lag time of 4\u00a0h followed by a 4-h drug release. Also, determination of the extent of erosion of the TCPR tablets revealed that the lag time is related to the coating erosion speed. The in vivo test in beagle dogs and comparison of the parameters for the TCPR tablets and reference preparations showed significant differences for T (7.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.408 and 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00) and C (185.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.561 and 587\u00a0\u00b1\u00a045.27\u00a0ng/ml) but no significant differences in the AUC (1757.876\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0208.832 and 1779.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0229.02\u00a0ng h/ml). These results demonstrated that the TCPR tablets successfully prolonged the lag time and controlled the release of propranolol.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to design a polyethylene oxide (PEO) binary hydrophilic matrix controlled system and investigate the most important influence(s) on the in vitro water-insoluble drug release behavior of this controlled system. Direct-compressed PEO binary matrix tablets were obtained from a variety of low viscosity hydrophilic materials as a sustained agent, using anhydrous drugs as a model drug. Water uptake rate, swelling rate, and erosion rate of matrices were investigated for the evaluation of the PEO hydrophilic matrix systems. The effect of the dose, the solubility of water-insoluble drug, and the rheology of polymers on in vitro release were also discussed. Based on the in vitro release kinetics study, three optimized PEO binary matrices were selected for further research. And, these PEO binary matrices had shown the similar release behavior that had been evaluated by the similarity factor f . Further study indicated that they had identical hydration, swelling, and erosion rate. Moreover, rheology study exhibited the similar rheological equation of Herschel-Bulkley and their viscosity was also within the same magnitude. Therefore, viscosity plays the most important role to control drug release compared to other factors in PEO binary matrix system. This research provides fundamental understanding of in vitro drug release of PEO binary hydrophilic matrix tablets and helps pharmaceutical workers to develop a hydrophilic controlled system, which will effectively shorten the process of formulation development by reducing trial-and-error.",

        "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, detecting objects in a new context remains a challenging task. Detectors learned from a public dataset can only work with a fixed list of categories, while training from scratch usually requires a large amount of training data with detailed annotations. This work aims to explore a novel approach u0026#x2013; learning object detectors from documentary films in a weakly supervised manner. This is inspired by the observation that documentaries often provide dedicated exposition of certain object categories, where visual presentations are aligned with subtitles. We believe that object detectors can be learned from such a rich source of information. Towards this goal, we develop a joint probabilistic framework, where individual pieces of information, including video frames and subtitles, are brought together via both visual and linguistic links. On top of this formulation, we further derive a weakly supervised learning algorithm, where object model learning and training set mining are unified in an optimization procedure. Experimental results on a real world dataset demonstrate that this is an effective approach to learning new object detectors.",

        "title": "Optimizing Video Object Detection via a Scale-Time Lattice.",
        "abstract": "High-performance object detection relies on expensive convolutional networks to compute features, often leading to significant challenges in applications, e.g. those that require detecting objects from video streams in real time. The key to this problem is to trade accuracy for efficiency in an effective way, i.e. reducing the computing cost while maintaining competitive performance. To seek a good balance, previous efforts usually focus on optimizing the model architectures. This paper explores an alternative approach, that is, to reallocate the computation over a scale-time space. The basic idea is to perform expensive detection sparsely and propagate the results across both scales and time with substantially cheaper networks, by exploiting the strong correlations among them. Specifically, we present a unified framework that integrates detection, temporal propagation, and across-scale refinement on a Scale-Time Lattice. On this framework, one can explore various strategies to balance performance and cost. Taking advantage of this flexibility, we further develop an adaptive scheme with the detector invoked on demand and thus obtain improved tradeoff. On ImageNet VID dataset, the proposed method can achieve a competitive mAP 79.6% at 20 fps, or 79.0% at 62 fps as a performance/speed tradeoff.1",

        "abstract": "Region anchors are the cornerstone of modern object detection techniques. State-of-the-art detectors mostly rely on a dense anchoring scheme, where anchors are sampled uniformly over the spatial domain with a predefined set of scales and aspect ratios. In this paper, we revisit this foundational stage. Our study shows that it can be done much more effectively and efficiently. Specifically, we present an alternative scheme, named Guided Anchoring, which leverages semantic features to guide the anchoring. The proposed method jointly predicts the locations where the center of objects of interest are likely to exist as well as the scales and aspect ratios at different locations. On top of predicted anchor shapes, we mitigate the feature inconsistency with a feature adaption module. We also study the use of high-quality proposals to improve detection performance. The anchoring scheme can be seamlessly integrated to proposal methods and detectors. With Guided Anchoring, we achieve $9.1%$ higher recall on MS COCO with $90%$ fewer anchors than the RPN baseline. We also adopt Guided Anchoring in Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet, respectively improving the detection mAP by $2.2%$, $2.7%$ and $1.2%$.",

        "abstract": "It is a common paradigm in object detection frameworks to treat all samples equally and target at maximizing the performance on average. In this work, we revisit this paradigm through a careful study on how different samples contribute to the overall performance measured in terms of mAP. Our study suggests that the samples in each mini-batch are neither independent nor equally important, and therefore a better classifier on average does not necessarily mean higher mAP. Motivated by this study, we propose the notion of Prime Samples, those that play a key role in driving the detection performance. We further develop a simple yet effective sampling and learning strategy called PrIme Sample Attention (PISA) that directs the focus of the training process towards such samples. Our experiments demonstrate that it is often more effective to focus on prime samples than hard samples when training a detector. Particularly, On the MSCOCO dataset, PISA outperforms the random sampling baseline and hard mining schemes, e.g. OHEM and Focal Loss, consistently by more than 1% on both single-stage and two-stage detectors, with a strong backbone ResNeXt-101.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The polymer solar cell (PSC) with Ca/Al electrode always suffers from low stability mainly due to the incorporation of oxygen and moisture-sensitive Ca electron-transport interlayer (ETL). To alleviate this problem, air-stable alternatives to Ca ETL are highly desired. Herein, we report two solution-processable, air-stable, effective and inexpensive ETLs based on potassium-neutralized perylene tetracarboxylic derivative (K 4 PTC) and its rGO composite (rGO-K 4 PTC), respectively. These ETL materials were facilely prepared and characterized by means of UV-vis, FL, FTIR, XPS and UPS. Importantly, both ETLs exhibited a low work function (WF) of 4.0\u00a0eV, which well matches the LUMO level of fullerene acceptors and allows their use as ETL in PSCs. As a result, the P3HT and PTB7-th-based devices with respective ETL remarkably outperformed those without ETL yielding increases of \u223c35% in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), which indicates good electron-transporting capabilities of K 4 PTC and rGO-K 4 PTC interlayers. The high-performance PSCs with the ETL gave average PCEs of 6.17\u20136.18% (for PTB7-th:PC 61 BM-based devices) and 7.26% (for PTB7-th:PC 71 BM-based devices), respectively, fairly comparable to those of Ca/Al devices (6.50% and 7.50%). Furthermore, the rGO-K 4 PTC device exhibited stability higher than that of the K 4 PTC device probably due to the fact that the rGO-K 4 PTC layer can provide more efficient protection for the active layer against degradation. Thus, rGO-K 4 PTC layer might be more suitable for real applications as compared to the K 4 PTC layer.",

Importantly, as-prepared Cu-Au NPs are highly stable, solution-processable and exhibit a broad localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band at long wavelengths of 550\u2013850\u00a0nm. Highly efficient plasmonic organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated by embedding Cu-Au NPs in an anodic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer. The average power conversion efficiency (PCE) was enhanced from 3.21% to 3.63% for poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 61 BM) based devices, from 6.51% to 7.13% for poly[(ethylhexyl-thiophenyl)-benzodithiophene -(ethylhexyl)-thienothiophene](PTB7-th):PC 61 BM based devices and from 7.53% to 8.48% for PTB7-th:PC 71 BM based devices, corresponding to 9.5\u201313.4% PCE improvement. Such an improvement is very comparable to that (12.5%) obtained in those with plasmonic Au NPs but achieved at lower cost. This study thus demonstrates a novel and cost-effective approach to enhance the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, in combination with the broad-band plasmonic Cu-Au bimetallic nanostructures.",

        "abstract": "Novel types of N,S,P-codoped carbons with varied nanostructures are developed as efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The carbon catalysts were facilely prepared using poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4\u2032-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS) nanospheres as single precursors through a pyrolysis procedure in the presence or absence of melamine. The as-prepared microporous carbon nanospheres NSP-PC-1 with a high surface area (967 m2 g\u22121) exhibit a significantly enhanced ORR catalytic activity compared to their solely N-doped counterpart (N-PC-1), suggesting the remarkable contribution of additional S,P-doping on the ORR performance. More importantly, the as-prepared mesoporous carbon nanosheets NSP-PC-2 with a moderately high surface area (613 m2 g\u22121) and comparable overall NSP content show greatly improved ORR catalytic activity relative to that of NSP-PC-1, which is even slightly superior to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. The excellent performance of NSP-PC-2 is mainly attributed to its proper N,S,P-codoping as well as advanced structural features.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, we report a series of defective carbon catalysts prepared through a facile and scalable \u201cN-doping-removal\u201d process using seaweed biomass sodium alginate (SA) as precursor. Our systematic studies reveal that the defect content, porosity characteristic and conductivity of defective carbons can be finely tuned by manipulating the pyrolysis temperature and viscosity of precursor polymer SA, which significantly affect the ORR performance. The optimized defective porous carbon catalyst (i.e., D-PC-1(900)) that was revealed to possess abundant ORR-active defects, large surface area of 1377 m 2 g -1 , abundant hierarchical porosity and good conductivity, exhibited very nice ORR activity and selectivity in 0.1\u202fM KOH, comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In 0.5\u202fM\u202fH 2 SO 4 , considerable ORR activity was also observed for D-PC-1(900), which is among the highest reported for defective carbons and comparable to many of N-doped carbons. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the carbon defect can create the active sites for ORR in acidic media. More importantly, in both alkaline and acidic media, D-PC-1(900) shows much better stability and methanol tolerance than those of the Pt/C catalyst. All these results demonstrate that the seaweed biomass derived defective carbon is an excellent candidate for non-precious-metal ORR catalyst in various fuel cells.",

The cysteine endopeptidase legumain is expressed in adult solid tumors, but its expression in NB has not been examined. In this study, we assayed legumain expression in two NB cell lines and in microarrays of tumor tissues collected from 46 children with undifferentiated NB, differentiated NB, and ganglioneuroblastoma. Correlation analyses showed that legumain was expressed in all NB cell lines tested and that expression correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation. The efficacy, specificity, and toxicity of EMC-AANL-DOX, a novel doxorubicin-based legumain-activated prodrug, were then evaluated in mouse model of NB. Compared with DOX, EMC-AANL-DOX showed greater inhibition of tumor growth and a lower toxicity at high doses. Neither leukocyte or platelet counts nor renal function or cardiac anatomy differed significantly between the EMC-AANL-DOX and control groups (p\u00a0>\u00a0.05), suggesting that the prodrug caused minimal bone marrow depression and did not induce renal or cardiac damage. The good specificity and efficacy of EMC-AANL-DOX and low toxicity recommend its use in the treatment of NB. Correlation analyses of NB differentiation and legumain expression may reveal a novel anti-tumor-related functions of the drug and a new strategy for the treatment of pediatric solid tumors.",

        "abstract": "Hepatoblastoma is the most common type of malignant liver tumor in children. While outcomes have been greatly improved in the past decades, the treatment of advanced hepatoblastoma has remained challenging. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a member of the polycomb group regulators of gene activity, is amplified and overexpressed in a variety of cancers. However, the role of EZH2 in hepatoblastoma has remained to be fully elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expression patterns of EZH2 in hepatoblastoma cells and to assess the anti\u2011cancer effects of EZH2 depletion. Western blot analysis revealed that EZH2 expression was significantly higher in hepatoblastoma specimens compared with that in peri\u2011tumor tissues, while p27 was reduced in hepatoblastoma. Suppression of EHZ2 using lentiviral small hairpin RNA inhibited hepatoblastoma cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and enhanced the expression of G1/S\u2011phase checkpoint protein p27. These results suggested that EZH2 may represent a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatoblastoma.",

        "abstract": "Specific primers targeting Penicillium digitatum were developed based on fungal genes RPB1 and cmd, which are conserved among the genomes of Penicillium spp. The specific primers were designed based on the mutational sites in the homologous regions of the conserved genes. The results indicated that primer pairs RPB1\u20131 and cmd-3 were specific enough to distinguish Penicillium digitatum (N1) from Penicillium chrysogenum (Q), Penicillium italicum (A10) and Penicillium expansum (L) when the DNA samples were diluted 100-fold. To further verify the effectiveness and specificity of the two primer pairs RPB1\u20131 and cmd-3, 38 strains of fungal isolates from sources related to citrus were detected using both primer pairs, and 14 candidate P. digitatum strains were identified. Then, the fourteen candidate P. digitatum strains were further identified as P. digitatum by morphological and molecular methods, which confirmed the detection accuracy and reliability of the specific primer pairs RPB1\u20131 and cmd-3 as molecular markers of P. digitatum. This work may significantly facilitate the rapid identification of P. digitatum in the citrus industry.",

        "abstract": "Kloeckera apiculata, as the anamorphic state of Hanseniaspora uvarum from the Ascomycota phylum, plays an important role in the inhibition of fungal diseases in plants and spontaneous wine fermentation. This study was performed to sequence and analyze the whole genome of K. apiculata strain 34-9; This analysis provides further genomic features and assists functional research. The complete genome was determined using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system applying paired-end and mate-pair methods to construct four reads libraries. The data assembly of all the reads resulted in a total genome size of 8.1 Mb, including 106 contigs, which were assembled into 41 scaffolds with a 31.95 % G+C content and a 234X sequence coverage. The performance of the gene prediction and functional annotation revealed that 2724 of 3786 protein-coding genes matched the KOG database, and 1127 genes were classified into GO categories. Further genome features analyses found 1066 microsatellite sites, 71 tRNAs, 3 rRNAs and 3 microRNAs in the genomic DNA. A prediction of the metabolic pathways identified potentially crucial genes for explaining the phenylalanine pathway involved in biocontrol. Comparisons with the typical yeasts Lachancea thermotolerans, Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed the particularity and difference of K. apiculata strain 34-9. The genome alignments among Hanseniaspora vineae T02/19AF, K. apiculata DSM 2768 and 34-9 indicated numerous homologous regions distributed over the genomes between strain DSM2768 and 34-9. A SSR analysis identified that mono- and tri- nucleotide repeat types were more abundant in all six types, likely affecting the evolution of K. apiculata.",

These genetically encoded proteins are readily optimized by directed evolution, function in , and act on structurally diverse substrates with high efficiency and selectivity, providing an effective route to many chiral strained structures.

Biochemists have addressed this challenge by screening nature's diversity to discover enzymes that catalyze the formation of complementary stereoisomers. We show here that the same approach can be applied to a new-to-nature enzymatic reaction, alkene cyclopropanation via carbene transfer. By screening diverse native and engineered heme proteins, we identified globins and serine-ligated \"P411\" variants of cytochromes P450 with promiscuous activity for cyclopropanation of unactivated alkene substrates. We then enhanced their activities and stereoselectivities by directed evolution: just 1-3 rounds of site-saturation mutagenesis and screening generated enzymes that transform unactivated alkenes and electron-deficient alkenes into each of the four stereoisomeric cyclopropanes with up to 5,400 total turnovers and 98% enantiomeric excess. These fully genetically encoded biocatalysts function in whole  cells in mild, aqueous conditions and provide the first example of enantioselective, intermolecular iron-catalyzed cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes.",

Recent advances in C-H functionalization technology have begun to transform this logic, while emphasizing the importance of and\u00a0challenges associated with selective alkylation at a sp carbon. Here we describe iron-based catalysts for the enantio-, regio- and chemoselective intermolecular alkylation of sp C-H bonds through carbene C-H insertion. The catalysts, derived from a cytochrome P450 enzyme in which the native cysteine axial ligand has been substituted for serine (cytochrome P411), are fully genetically encoded and produced in bacteria, where they can be tuned by directed evolution for activity and selectivity. That these proteins activate iron, the most abundant transition metal, to perform this chemistry provides a desirable alternative to noble-metal catalysts, which have dominated the field of C-H functionalization. The laboratory-evolved enzymes functionalize diverse substrates containing benzylic, allylic or \u03b1-amino C-H bonds with high turnover and excellent selectivity. Furthermore, they have enabled the development of concise routes to several natural products. The use of the native iron-haem cofactor of these enzymes to mediate sp C-H alkylation\u00a0suggests that\u00a0diverse haem proteins could serve as potential catalysts for this abiological transformation, and will facilitate the development of new enzymatic C-H functionalization reactions for applications in chemistry and synthetic biology.",

        "abstract": "Transfers of carbene moieties to heterocycles or cyclic alkenes to obtain C(sp2)\u2012H alkylation or cyclopropane products are valuable transformations for synthesis of pharmacophores and chemical building blocks. Through their readily tunable active site geometries, hemoprotein \"carbene transferases\" could provide an alternative to traditional transition metal catalysts by enabling heterocycle functionalizations with high chemo-, regio- and stereocontrol. However, carbene transferases accepting heterocyclic substrates are scarce; the few enzymes capable of heterocycle or cyclic internal alkene functionalization described to date are characterized by low turnovers or depend on artificially introduced, costly iridium-porphyrin cofactors. We addressed this challenge by evolving a cytochrome P450 for highly efficient carbene transfer to indoles, pyrroles, and cyclic alkenes. We first developed a spectrophotometric high-throughput screening assay based on 1 methylindole C3-alkylation that enabled rapid analysis of thousands of P450 variants and comprehensive directed evolution via random and targeted mutagenesis. This effort yielded a P450 variant with 11 amino acid substitutions and a large deletion of the non-catalytic P450 reductase domain, which chemoselectively C3-alkylates indoles with up to 470 turnovers per minute and 18,000 total turnovers. We subsequently used this optimized alkylation variant for parallel evolution towards more challenging heterocycle carbene functionalizations, including C2/C3 regioselective pyrrole alkylation, enantioselective indole alkylation with ethyl-2-diazopropanoate, and cyclic internal alkene cyclopropanation. The resulting set of efficient biocatalysts showcases the tunability of hemoproteins for highly selective functionalization of cyclic targets and the power of directed evolution to enhance the scope of new-to-nature enzyme catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Early reproductive development in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important process have been conducted for common wheat (). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early wheat reproductive development, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. -means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence development alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral development may be conserved in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the  () gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of  in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more infertile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence development that may be pivotal for floral and grain development, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The CRISPR/Cas9 technology is evolved from a type II bacterial immune system and represents a new generation of targeted genome editing technology that can be applied to nearly all organisms. Site-specific modification is achieved by a single guide RNA (usually about 20 nucleotides) that is complementary to a target gene or locus and is anchored by a protospacer-adjacent motif. Cas9 nuclease then cleaves the targeted DNA to generate double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are subsequently repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanisms. NHEJ may introduce indels that cause frame shift mutations and hence the disruption of gene functions. When combined with double or multiplex guide RNA design, NHEJ may also introduce targeted chromosome deletions, whereas HDR can be engineered for target gene correction, gene replacement, and gene knock-in. In this review, we briefly survey the history of the CRISPR/Cas9 system invention and its genome-editing mechanism. We also describe the most recent innovation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, particularly the broad applications of modified Cas9 variants, and discuss the potential of this system for targeted genome editing and modification for crop improvement.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has been the most popular feature learning method used for a variety of computer vision applications in the past 3 years. Not surprisingly, this technique, especially the convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) structure, is exploited to identify the human actions, achieving great success. Most algorithms in existence directly adopt the basic ConvNets structure, which works pretty well in the ideal situation, e.g., under stable lighting conditions. However, its performance degrades significantly when the intra-variation in relation to image appearance occurs within the same category. To solve this problem, we propose a new method, integrating the semantically meaningful attributes into deep learning's hierarchical structure. Basically, the idea is to add simple yet effective attributes to the category level of ConvNets such that the attribute information is able to drive the learning procedure. The experimental results based on three popular action recognition databases show that the embedding of auxiliary multiple attributes into the deep learning framework improves the classification accuracy significantly.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Hashing, which seeks for binary codes to represent data, has drawn increasing research interest in recent years. Most existing Hashing methods follow a projection-quantization framework which first  projects  high-dimensional data into compact low-dimensional space and then  quantifies  the compact data into binary codes. The projection step plays a key role in Hashing and academia has paid considerable attention to it. Previous works have proven that a good projection should simultaneously 1) preserve important information in original data, and 2) lead to compact representation with low quantization error. However, they adopted a greedy two-step strategy to consider the above two properties  separately . In this paper, we empirically show that such a two-step strategy will result in a sub-optimal solution because the optimal solution to 1) limits the feasible set for the solution to 2). We put forward a novel projection learning method for Hashing, dubbed  Optimized Projection  (OPH). Specifically, we propose to learn the projection in a unified formulation which can find a good  trade-off  such that the  overall  performance can be optimized. A general framework is given such that OPH can be incorporated with different Hashing methods for different situations. We also introduce an effective gradient-based optimization algorithm for OPH. We carried out extensive experiments for Hashing-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor search and Content-based Data Retrieval on six benchmark datasets. The results show that OPH significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art related Hashing methods.",

        "abstract": "The recent years have witnessed the success of deep convolutional neural networks for image classification and many related tasks. It should be pointed out that the existing training strategies assume there is a clean dataset for model learning. In elaborately constructed benchmark datasets, deep network has yielded promising performance under the assumption. However, in real-world applications, it is burdensome and expensive to collect sufficient clean training samples. On the other hand, collecting noisy labeled samples is much economical and practical, especially with the rapidly increasing amount of visual data in theWeb. Unfortunately, the accuracy of current deep models may drop dramatically even with 5% to 10% label noise. Therefore, enabling label noise resistant classification has become a crucial issue in the data driven deep learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a DEep COnfiDEnce network, DECODE, to address this issue. In particular, based on the distribution of mislabeled data, we adopt a confidence evaluation module which is able to determine the confidence that a sample is mislabeled. With the confidence, we further use a weighting strategy to assign different weights to different samples so that the model pays less attention to low confidence data which is more likely to be noise. In this way, the deep model is more robust to label noise. DECODE is designed to be general such that it can be easily combine with existing architectures. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets and the results validate that DECODE can improve the accuracy of deep models trained with noisy data.",

        "abstract": "Transferrin (Tf) plays an important function in iron homeostasis and metabolism of organisms. In this study, we identified and characterized the Tf gene in Megalobrama amblycephala and evaluated its expression in basal conditions as well as after iron overload and experimental infection with Aeromonas hydrophila. Furthermore, we studied the iron binding properties of recombinant Tf. The full-length M. amblycephala Tf complementary DNA (cDNA) (GenBank accession no.: KX698308) of 2245\u00a0bp was cloned and contained a 1953\u00a0bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 650 amino acid residues and flanked by a 68\u00a0bp 5' and a 204\u00a0bp 3' untranslated regions (UTR). Predicted conservative structure illustrated that M. amblycephala Tf consisted of two conservative Tf domains. Amino acid sequence alignment revealed that M. amblycephala Tf had high similarity with that of cyprinids deposited in Genbank, and phylogenetic analysis showed that M. amblycephala Tf clustered with Ctenopharyngodon idella and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix. Tissue expression pattern analyses demonstrated that the liver was the main Tf mRNA expressing organ, being significantly higher than other tissues (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the liver, Tf mRNA expression in fish artificially injected with the pathogenic bacteria A. hydrophila was significantly upregulated, reaching a peak at 12\u00a0h post injection (hpi) and then decreasing afterward. The expression in FeCl-injected fish showed a similar tendency, but reached a peak at 8\u00a0hpi. Meanwhile, fish serum iron significantly decreased following A. hydrophila injection, but increased to peak at 4\u00a0hpi and then decreased in FeCl-injected fish. The recombinant M. amblycephala Tf showed iron binding capacity using CAS analysis. These results are helpful to understand the structure and regulation of expression of Tf, as well as the specific function of Tf for both immune responses and iron homeostasis.",

To comprehensively understand the impact of catecholamine stress hormone norepinephrine (NE) on the pathogenicity of Aeromonas hydrophila, we assessed variations in bacterial growth, virulence-related genes expression and virulence factors activity after NE addition in serum-SAPI medium. Further, we assessed the effects of NE on A.\u00a0hydrophila virulence in vivo by challenging fish with pathogenic strain AH196 and following with or without NE injection. The NE-associated stimulation of A.\u00a0hydrophila strain growth was not linear-dose-dependent, and only 100\u00a0\u03bcM, or higher concentrations, could stimulate growth. Real-time PCR analyses revealed that NE notably changed 13 out of the 16 virulence-associated genes (e.g. ompW, ahp, aha, ela, ahyR, ompA, and fur) expression, which were all significantly upregulated in A.\u00a0hydrophila AH196 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). NE could enhance the protease activity, but not affect the lipase activity, hemolysis, and motility. Further, the mortality of crucian carp challenged with A.\u00a0hydrophila AH196 was significantly higher in the group treated with NE (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Collectively, our results showed that NE enhanced the growth and virulence of pathogenic bacterium A.\u00a0hydrophila.",

This paper provides the first reliable evidence about the occurrence of C. laticeps in northern China that is based on detailed morphological characteristics and mitochondrial cox1 sequences. C. laticeps was found in freshwater bream Abramis brama (L.), in the River Irtysh, with the prevalence of 40% and mean intensity of infection 8. The tapeworms were rather similar in their morphological characters to the morphotype 1 of C. laticeps which is typified by the possession of a slender body with a flabellate wide scolex, narrow neck, robust, long and clearly visible vas deferens, large, and almost spherical cirrus-sac containing well-developed internal seminal vesicle and the first vitelline follicles and first testes beginning far from anterior margin of the body. Subsequent molecular analysis confirmed the morphological identification of the species. Our results show that the studied specimens were firmly clustered into the C. laticeps clade and formed a monophyletic group with C. laticeps morphotype 1 and 2 from Europe and Russia. In China, C. laticeps is a non-indigenous fish parasite, which has the most probably been introduced into the Irtysh River basin with its typical host inhabiting Russia. ",

Six actinospore types were detected exclusively from the oligochaete Branchiura sowerbyi Beddard with very high prevalence (18%). Five out of the six types were identified as the same actinosporeans described in previous reports, the sixth actinosporean was identified as a new Neoactinomyxum type and described here based on morphological and molecular characterisation. Spore body of the actinospore was globular, much smaller than caudal processes. Three caudal processes were disc-like in apical view, hemispherical in side view, closer together and encircling the spore body. The number of sporoplasm cells was detected as eight in one specimen. The new actinosporean markedly differed from other Neoactinomyxum types in literature having much bigger caudal processes. DNA sequence analyses further confirmed the morphological identification, and revealed the actinosporean described here (KU641392) possessed less than 94% sequence similarity with myxozoans available in the GenBank database.",

The sugar yield of pretreated sample achieved 410.67\u202fmg/g in 48\u202fh, which suffered from optimized microwave-assisted [TBA][OH] pretreatment. The work mechanism was illuminated by chemical composition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), C cross polarization/magic-angle spinning solid state NMR (C solid NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses. The combined effect of microwave and [TBA][OH] leads to the violent deconstruction of lignin, removal of hemicelluloses, destruction of crystalline region and an eroded, pored and irregular micro-morphology.

Herein, we developed a novel magnetic effervescent tablet containing ionic liquid microextraction (MET-ILM) for determination of pyrethroids in dairy milk. It contains only NaCO as an alkali source (no acidic source) in the FeO magnetic tablet; the CO-forming reaction is initiated in the acidic solution containing the analytes, and thus the prepared tablet can be stored for long time periods without deterioration. The combined action of extractant and sorbent vastly increase the extraction efficiency. The optimized procedure consisted of an effervescent tablet, 2:1 HCl:NaCO, and 60\u202f\u03bcL [CMIM]PF as extraction solvent. The LODs for five pyrethroids were 0.024-0.075\u202f\u03bcg\u202fkg with recoveries of 78.3-101.8%. The RSDs were <4.8% and <6.3% for intra- and inter-day precisions. Overall, the method is very feasible for use in the field.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects and related mechanisms of natural organic matter (NOM) on the photolysis of methyltriclosan (MTCS), a metabolite of triclosan. Addition of two representative NOM isolates, Pony Lake fulvic acid (PLFA-microbial origin) and Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA-terrestrial origin), significantly inhibited the direct photolytic rate of MTCS by \u223c70%. The MTCS photolytic rate in the presence of PLFA was greater than for SRFA. NOM not only suppressed photolysis by light-shielding, but also produced ROS to oxidatively degrade MTCS and/or triplet NOM (3NOM*) to sensitize degradation. The dual effects of light-screening and photo-sensitization led to an overall decrease in photolysis of MTCS with a positive concentration-dependence. Upon addition of NOM, EPR documented the occurrence of 1O2 and \u02d9OH in the photolytic process, and the bimolecular k value for the reaction of 1O2 with MTCS was 1.86 \u00d7 106 M\u22121 s\u22121. ROS-quenching experiments indicated that the contribution of \u02d9OH (19.1\u201329.5%) to indirect photolysis of MTCS was lower than for 1O2 (38.3\u201358.7%). Experiments with D2O further demonstrated that 1O2 participated in MTCS photodegradation. Moreover, the addition of sorbic acid and O2 gas to the reaction confirmed the participation of 3NOM* as a key reactant in the photochemical transformation of MTCS. This is the first comprehensive analysis of NOM effects on the indirect photolysis of MTCS, which provides new insights for understanding the environmental fate of MTCS in natural environments.",

In single-phase region, EG-in-IL (EG/IL), bicontinuous (B.C.), and IL-in-EG (IL/EG) subregions can be identified by the dc conductivity. The inflection points of the relaxation parameters (dielectric intensity and relaxation time) are consistent with the phase boundaries between IL/EG and B.C. and B.C. and EG/IL subregions, which imply that the change of microstructure of this system can be detected by the dielectric response. Furthermore, in IL/EG microregion, phase parameters of constituent phases were calculated based on interface polarization theory. The trends of relaxation times for both of the calculated values \u03c4 MW and experimental values \u03c4 as a function of IL content in IL/EG microregion are almost the same, which infers that the dielectric relaxation originates from the interfacial polarization. This work is helpful to understand the dynamics and phase behavior of nonaqueous microemulsions.",

The contents of water and toluene were varied separately while the ratios of the other two components were fixed. Remarkable dielectric relaxations were observed around 1\u00a0MHz and dielectric intensity shows different variation with the increase of the contents of water or toluene. Dielectric parameters were obtained by fitting the data using the Cole\u2013Cole equation with one dispersion term. The reverse micelles, water-in-oil, and oil-in-water micro-regions of the microemulsions were identified by the dependence of conductivity of the dispersed phase and continuous phase on the contents of water or toluene. Hanai theory and the corresponding analysis method were used to calculate the phase parameters of the constituent phases. The analysis results suggest that the dielectric relaxation probably arises from the interfacial polarization.",

        "abstract": "Following the discovery of the primary culture of neural stem cells, the spheroid culture has been recognized as one of the selective culture methods for somatic stem cells. Since then, various methods were reported to generate spheroids, which can enrich the potent stem cell population. However, the fundamental factors affecting spheroid formation remain unclear. In this study, we focused on the surface property of the culture dishes, in particular, hydrophobicity. Primary mouse skin culture cells were prepared with conventional two-dimensional culture, and then, the cells were transferred to culture dishes with varying hydrophobicity, which was confirmed with the water contact angles. Of these, a culture dish possessing an almost 90-degree water contact angle was the only one that successfully exhibited spheroid formation. The spheroid formation was spontaneous, efficient and stable. Since this outcome was achieved with a conventional culture medium with serum but without any additives such as EGF, bFGF and B27, the spheroid formation from this process was not affected by serum and was also not dependent on additives. The results from immunofluorescence and quantitative real-time PCR testing showed the expression of ES cell markers such as SSEA-1, SOX2, OCT4 and Nanog, which confirmed that the spheroids with this method are comparable to those from other methods. This outcome was reproducible and could be applied not only to skin-derived cells but also to oral mucosa-derived cells, cortical bone-derived cells and 3T3 cells, also suggesting the generality and robustness of this phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "The results from our recent study showed the presence of two distinct spheroid-forming mechanisms, i.e., spontaneous and mechanical. In this study, we focused on the spontaneously formed spheroids, and the character of spontaneously formed spheroids from mouse compact bone-derived cells (CBDCs) was explored. Cells from (C57BL/6J) mouse leg bones were isolated, and compact bone-derived cells were cultured after enzymatic digestion. Spontaneous spheroid formation was achieved on a culture plate with specific water contact angle as reported. The expression levels of embryonic stem cell markers were analyzed using immunofluorescence and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Then, the cells from spheroids were induced into osteogenic and neurogenic lineages. The spontaneously formed spheroids from CBDCs were positive for ES cell markers such as SSEA1, Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog. Additionally, the expressions of fucosyltransferase 4/FUT4 (SSEA1), Sox2, and Nanog were significantly higher than those in monolayer cultured cells. The gene expression of mesenchymal stem cell markers was almost identical in both spheroids and monolayer-cultured cells, but the expression of Sca-1 was higher in spheroids. Spheroid-derived cells showed significantly higher osteogenic and neurogenic marker expression than monolayer-cultured cells after induction. Spontaneously formed spheroids expressed stem cell markers and showed enhanced osteogenic and neurogenic differentiation capabilities than cells from the conventional monolayer culture, which supports the superior stemness.",

As a result, each component has its own pattern of impact on the reliability problem of LED packages, such as chip failure, package failure, and interconnection failure and so on. Among these failures, the fatigue failure of wire bonds those work as the interconnection is a common but severe issue that will cause a catastrophic failure of the LED package. Therefore developing a precise prediction method for the fatigue lifetime of the wire bonds has attracted many attentions of LED manufacturers and researchers. In this paper, the thermal, mechanical stress distributions on a high power LED package driven by different currents were simulated from a thermal-mechanical finite element simulation with the ANSYS Multiphysics module. Then the mean cycles to failure could be estimated based on the semi-empirical fatigue model.",

In this paper, the nonlinear and linear simplified physical model of shaft system is established. The control equations of hull-bearing-oil film-shafting systems are derived. Power flow transfer characteristics of the coupling model are analyzed. Condition monitoring theory of large ship propulsion shafting energy flow distribution is proposed to provide methods and technical supports for optimal design, installation, performance monitoring and maintenance of large ship propulsion shafting, which can also be provided as a reasonable basis for extending the service life of the ship.",

        "abstract": "Due to the complicated structure, vibration signal of rotating machinery is multicomponent with nonstationary and nonlinear features, so it is difficult to diagnose faults effectively. Therefore, effective extraction of vibration signal characteristics is the key to diagnose the faults of rotating machinery. Mode mixing and illusive components existed in some conventional methods, such as EMD and EEMD, which leads to misdiagnosis in extracting signals. Given these reasons, a new fault diagnosis method, namely, variation mode decomposition (VMD), was proposed in this paper. VMD is a newly developed technique for adaptive signal decomposition, which can decompose a multicomponent signal into a series of quasi-orthogonal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) simultaneously, corresponding to the components of signal clearly. To further research on VMD method, the advantages and characteristics of VMD are investigated via numerical simulations. VMD is then applied to detect oil whirl and oil whip for rotor systems fault diagnosis via practical vibration signal. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VMD method.",

        "abstract": "There is still an unmet demand for materials with excellent biocompatibility, controlled hydrolytic capability, and elegant responsiveness to chemical or physical stimuli. To engineer biocompatible materials from \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD), in this study, we synthesized acetalated \u03b2-CDs (Ac-\u03b2CDs) by one-pot acetalation using 2-ethoxypropene as an acetonation reagent, which can be further processed into nanoparticles (NPs) via the emulsion technique. Ac-\u03b2CD NPs showed pH-labile hydrolysis and pH-triggered release of docetaxel (DTX) payload. Both properties were mainly dominated by the molar ratio of linear to cyclic acetal, which can be conveniently modulated by the acetalation time used for materials synthesis. Ac-\u03b2CD NPs were found to be biocompatible in both in vitro cell culture and in vivo acute toxicity evaluations following intravenous injection. In vitro cell culture experiments demonstrated that antitumor activity of DTX against both sensitive and resistant cancer cells was remarkably improved by formulation into Ac-\u03b2CD nanomedicines. In vivo antitumor study also substantiated the dramatically enhanced efficacy of DTX/Ac-\u03b2CD NPs in a melanoma-bearing nude mouse model. These studies demonstrated that NPs derived from Ac-\u03b2CDs may serve as biocompatible and effective carriers for drug delivery.",

Currently it remains challenging for discovering new biomolecules that can prominently enhance cellular internalization and tissue retention of nanoparticles (NPs). Herein we report for the first time that a mussel-inspired engineering approach may notably promote cellular uptake and tissue retention of NPs. In this strategy, the catechol moiety is covalently anchored onto biodegradable NPs. Thus, fabricated NPs can be more effectively internalized by sensitive and multidrug resistant tumor cells, as well as some normal cells, resulting in remarkably potentiated in vitro activity when an antitumor drug is packaged. Moreover, the newly engineered NPs afford increased tissue retention post local or oral delivery. This biomimetic approach is promising for creating functional nanomaterials for drug delivery, vaccination, and cell therapy.",

From September 2010 to November 2013, 151 patients with intra-articular calcaneus fractures were treated at our department by ORIF. They were 95 men and 56 women, 18 to 69 years of age. According to the Sanders classification, there were 24 cases of type II, 76 ones of type III and 51 ones of type IV. Medial distraction was used in 27 cases but not in 124 ones. The 2 groups were compatible, without significant differences in preoperative general data (p > 0.05). The two groups were compared in intraoperative indexes and follow-up radiological data. The mean duration of surgery in the distraction group (71.6 \u00b1 18.3 minutes) was significantly shorter than that in the non-distraction group (80.4\u00b120.7 minutes), and the varus angle in the distraction group (5.3\u00b0 \u00b1 4.4\u00b0) was significantly smaller than that in the non-distraction group (10.6\u00b0 \u00b1 6.5\u00b0) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in intraoperative bleeding, postoperative drainage, hospital stay, bone union time, follow-up duration, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society score, B\u00f6hler angle, Gissane angle, calcaneal axis, calcaneal horizontal length, tuberosity height, hillock calcaneal height, calcaneal width, or talar inclination angle (p > 0.05). ORIF assisted by medial distraction technique is effective for intra-articular calcaneal fractures, especially in correcting the calcaneal axis.",

        "abstract": "Although the bin-normalized frequency domain block LMS (NFBLMS) algorithm has theoretically very fast convergence speed, it suffers from convergence to a biased steady state solution when causality is not met or when the adaptive filter is of deficient length. A modified FBLMS (MFBLMS) algorithm with guaranteed optimal steady state performance has been proposed, but the theoretical analysis on its convergence properties has not been presented. This paper analyzes the convergence behavior of the algorithm by using the theory of asymptotically equivalent matrices. The eigenvalues of the matrix controlling the convergence behavior is proven to have the tendency to be equally distributed, and a theoretical eigenvalue spread is derived based on the first-order autoregressive (AR) signal model, which is significantly lower than that of the time domain LMS (TDLMS) algorithm. Therefore the convergence speed of the MFBLMS is significantly higher than that of the TDLMS algorithm for colored reference signal. Simulations are carried out to validate the convergence behavior predicted from the theoretical analysis. The convergence behavior of the newly developed MFBLMS algorithm is investigated.Eigenvalues is proven to have the tendency of equal distribution.Theoretical eigenvalue spread for AR-1 signals is obtained.Simulations validate the convergence properties.",

        "abstract": "The Android OS not only dominates 78.6% of the worldwide smartphone market in 2014, but importantly has been widely used for mission critical tasks (e.g., medical devices, auto/aircraft navigators, embedded in satellite project). The core of Android, System Server (SS), is a multi-threaded process that contains most of the system services and provides the essential functionalities to support applications (apps). Considering the complicated design of the SS and its easily-accessible system services (e.g., via Android APIs), we conjecture that the SS may face DoS attacks. As the SS plays the important role in Android, serious DoS attacks could cause single-point-of-failure to the phone system. By studying the source code, we discovered a general design trait in the concurrency control mechanism of the SS that could be vulnerable to DoS attacks. To validate our hypothesis, we design a tool to cost efficiently explore high-risk methods in the SS. After a systematic analysis of 2,154 candidate-risky methods, we found four unknown vulnerabilities in critical services (e.g., the ActivityManager and the WindowManager), which are named the Android Stroke Vulnerabilities ({\\\\it ASVs}). Exploiting the ASVs would continuously block all other requests for system services, followed by killing the SS and soft-rebooting the OS. Results of a further threat analysis show that by writing a loop to invoke Android APIs in an app, an attacker can continually freeze (reboot) the device at targeted critical moments (e.g., when patching vulnerable apps). Furthermore, ASVs can be exploited to enhance malware with anti-removal capability or to design the ransomware by putting the devices into continuous DoS loops. After being informed, Google confirmed our findings promptly. We also proposed to their Android framework team several improvements in their concurrency control design and a fine-grained failure recovery mechanism for the SS.",

        "abstract": "Android Framework is a layer of software that exists in every Android system managing resources of all Android apps. A vulnerability in Android Framework can lead to severe hacks, such as destroying user data and leaking private information. With tens of millions of Android devices unpatched due to Android fragmentation, vulnerabilities in Android Framework certainly attract attackers to exploit them. So far, enormous manual effort is needed to craft such exploits. To our knowledge, no research has been done on automatic generation of exploits that take advantage of Android Framework vulnerabilities. We make a first step towards this goal by applying symbolic execution of Android Framework to finding bugs and generating exploits. Several challenges have been raised by the task. (1) The information of an app flows to Android Framework in multiple intricate steps, making it difficult to identify symbolic inputs. (2) Android Framework has a complex initialization phase, which exacerbates the state space explosion problem. (3) A straightforward design that builds the symbolic executor as a layer inside the Android system will not work well: not only does the implementation have to ensure the compatibility with the Android system, but it needs to be maintained whenever Android gets updated. We present novel ideas and techniques to resolve the challenges, and have built the first system for symbolic execution of Android Framework. It fundamentally changes the state of the art in exploit generation on the Android system, and has been applied to constructing new techniques for finding vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "Android Application Framework is an integral and foundational part of the Android system. Each of the 1.4 billion Android devices relies on the system services of Android Framework to manage applications and system resources. Given its critical role, a vulnerability in the framework can be exploited to launch large-scale cyber attacks and cause severe harms to user security and privacy. Recently, many vulnerabilities in Android Framework were exposed, showing that it is vulnerable and exploitable. However, most of the existing research has been limited to analyzing Android applications, while there are very few techniques and tools developed for analyzing Android Framework. In particular, to our knowledge, there is no previous work that analyzes the framework through symbolic execution, an approach that has proven to be very powerful for vulnerability discovery and exploit generation. We design and build the first system, Centaur, that enables symbolic execution of Android Framework. Due to some unique characteristics of the framework, such as its middleware nature and extraordinary complexity, many new challenges arise and are tackled in Centaur. In addition, we demonstrate how the system can be applied to discovering new vulnerability instances, which can be exploited by several recently uncovered attacks against the framework, and to generating PoC exploits.",

It has a high requirement for cyber security analystsu0027 capabilities of information processing and expertise in cyber defense. However, the present situation is that most novice analysts who are responsible for performing data triage tasks suffer a great deal from the complexity and intensity of their tasks. To fill the gap, we propose to provide novice analysts with on-the-job suggestions by presenting the relevant data triage operations conducted by senior analysts in previous tasks. In a previous study, a tracing method has been developed to track an analystu0027s data triage operations. This paper mainly presents a data triage operation retrieval system that (1) models the context of a data triage analytic process, (2) uses a centroid similarity matching method to compare contexts, and (3) presents the matched traces to the novice analysts as suggestions. We have implemented and evaluated the performance of the system through both automated testing and human evaluation. The results show that the proposed retrieval system can effectively identify the relevant traces based on an analystu0027s current analytic process.",

Under the excitation of 345\u00a0nm, BiBa 2 V 3 O 11 : Eu 3+  phosphors show the strongest emission peaks located at 622\u00a0nm corresponding to the electric dipole  5 D 0 \u00a0\u2192\u00a0 7 F 2  transition. The critical quenching concentrations of Sm 3+ /Eu 3+  in the BiBa 2 V 3 O 11  lattice were 5\u00a0mol% and 8\u00a0mol%. The thermal stability of Eu 3+  doped BiBa 2 V 3 O 11  and CIE coordinates of BiBa 2 V 3 O 11 : Sm 3+ /Eu 3+  phosphors were also investigated.

The spectral line of CI 247. 856 nm was chosen to analyze the excitation properties of laser-induced plasma of different carbon speciations. The chemical compositions, molecular binding forces of materials on were used to account for the differences of spectral properties among different forms of carbons. The results show that the excitation energy of carbon in compound with complex structure and greater chemical bond energy requires relatively more energy.",

        "abstract": "Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is an important component of vascular homeostasis. During vascular disease, endothelial cells are exposed to excess reactive oxygen species that can alter cellular phenotype by inducing various signaling pathways. In the current study, we examined the implications of H(2)O(2)-induced signaling for eNOS phosphorylation status and activity in porcine aortic endothelial cells. We found that H(2)O(2) treatment enhanced eNOS activity and NO bioactivity as determined by the conversion of l-[(3)H]arginine to l-[(3)H]citrulline and cellular cGMP content. Concomitant with eNOS activation, H(2)O(2) also activated Akt, increased eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177, and decreased eNOS phosphorylation at Thr-495. H(2)O(2)-induced promotion of eNOS activity and modulation of the eNOS phosphorylation status at Ser-1177 and Thr-495 were significantly attenuated by selective inhibitors of Src kinase, the ErbB receptor family, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K). We found that Akt activation, eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation, and eNOS activation by H(2)O(2) were calcium-dependent, whereas eNOS dephosphorylation at Thr-495 was not, suggesting a branch point in the signaling cascade downstream from PI 3-K. Consistent with this, overexpression of a dominant negative isoform of Akt inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 but not dephosphorylation of eNOS at Thr-495. Together, these data indicate that H(2)O(2) promotes calcium-dependent eNOS activity through a coordinated change in the phosphorylation status of the enzyme mediated by Src- and ErbB receptor-dependent PI 3-K activation. In turn, PI 3-K mediates eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation via a calcium- and Akt-dependent pathway, whereas eNOS Thr-495 dephosphorylation does not involve calcium or Akt. This response may represent an attempt by endothelial cells to maintain NO bioactivity under conditions of enhanced oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorylation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is a critical event in the up-regulation and activation of p53 during cellular stress. In this study, we characterized the signaling pathway linking oxidative stress to p53 through the platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGF beta) receptor and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. In response to H2O2, we observed phosphorylation of p53 specifically at serine 15, but not serine 9, 20, or 392. Phosphorylation of Ser-15 was correlated with enhanced induction and functional activation of p53 manifest as transcription of the p53 target p21CIP/WAF. We found that H2O2 induced phosphorylation of the PDGF beta receptor and increased ATM kinase activity, two events integral to p53 activation as either AG1433 (a PDGF beta receptor inhibitor) or caffeine (an ATM kinase inhibitor) inhibited Ser-15 phosphorylation. Similarly, p53 activation by H2O2 was inhibited by kinase-inactive forms of the PDGF beta receptor or ATM. Inhibition of ATM kinase had no effect on H2O2-induced PDGF beta receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas PDGF beta receptor suppression with RNA interference impaired H2O2-induced ATM activation, indicating that ATM lies downstream to the PDGF beta receptor in this signaling cascade. Functionally, inhibition of the PDGF beta receptor abrogated the inhibition of cell proliferation, and promotion of apoptosis due to H2O2 treatment. Thus, these data link PDGF beta receptor transactivation to H2O2-induced p53 phosphorylation and suggest a functional role for growth factor receptors in modulation of p53 function.",

        "abstract": "Endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO) is dependent on adequate cellular levels of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an important cofactor for the nitric oxide synthases. Vascular diseases are often characterized by vessel wall inflammation and cytokine treatment of endothelial cells increases BH4 levels, in part through the induction of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH I), the rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 biosynthesis. However, the molecular mechanisms of cytokine-mediated GTPCH I induction in the endothelium are not entirely clear. We sought to investigate the signaling pathways whereby cytokines induce GTPCH I expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced endothelial cell GTPCH I protein and BH4 modestly, whereas high-level induction required combinations of IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In the presence of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha increased GTPCH I mRNA in a manner dependent on nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), as this effect was abrogated by overexpression of a dominant-negative IkappaB construct. HUVEC IFN-gamma treatment resulted in signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) activation and DNA binding in a Jak2-dependent manner, as this was inhibited by AG490. Conversely, overexpression of Jak2 effectively substituted for IFN-gamma in supporting TNF-alpha-mediated GTPCH I induction. The role of IFN-gamma was also Stat1-dependent as Stat1-null cells exhibited no GTPCH I induction in response to cytokines. However, Stat1 activation with oncostatin M failed to support TNF-alpha-mediated GTPCH I induction because of concomitant Stat3 activation. Consistent with this notion, siRNA-mediated Stat3 gene silencing allowed oncostatin M to substitute for IFN-gamma in this system. These data implicate both NF-kappaB and Stat1 in endothelial cell cytokine-stimulated GTPCH I induction and highlight the role of Stat3 in modulating Stat1-supported gene transcription. Thus, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha exert distinct but cooperative roles for BH4 biosynthesis in endothelium that may have important implications for vascular function during vascular inflammation.",

        "abstract": "A warming climate is anticipated to increase the future heat-related total mortality in urban areas. However, little evidence has been reported for cause-specific mortality or nonurban areas. Here we assessed the impact of climate change on heat-related total and cause-specific mortality in both urban and rural counties of Jiangsu Province, China, in the next five decades. To address the potential uncertainty in projecting future heat-related mortality, we applied localized urban- and nonurban-specific exposure response functions, six population projections including a no population change scenario and five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and 42 temperature projections from 21 global-scale general circulation models and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Results showed that projected warmer temperatures in 2016-2040 and 2041-2065 will lead to higher heat-related mortality for total non-accidental, cardiovascular, respiratory, stroke, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes occurring annually during May to September in Jiangsu Province, China. Nonurban residents in Jiangsu will suffer from more excess heat-related cause-specific mortality in 2016-2065 than urban residents. Variations across climate models and RCPs dominated the uncertainty of heat-related mortality estimation whereas population size change only had limited influence. Our findings suggest that targeted climate change mitigation and adaptation measures should be taken in both urban and nonurban areas of Jiangsu Province. Specific public health interventions should be focused on the leading causes of death (stroke, IHD, and COPD), whose health burden will be amplified by a warming climate.",

We compared intermittent Pringle with continuous half-Pringle maneuver in laparoscopic liver resections of tumors in segment 7. A retrospective analysis was conducted in a total of 36 consecutive patients with tumors in segment 7 undergoing laparoscopic liver resections between July 2011 and February 2016 (16 in the Pringle group versus 20 in the half-Pringle group). The two groups were well matched in baseline characteristics. The operative time (274.5\u2009\u00b1\u200934.3 versus 237.6\u2009\u00b1\u200941.8\u00a0min), overall declamping time (28.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6 versus 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5\u00a0min), and ischemic duration (69.7\u2009\u00b1\u200916.5 versus 52.7\u2009\u00b1\u200913.2\u00a0min) were significantly longer in the Pringle group (\u2009<\u20090.05). The amount of intraoperative blood loss (612.5\u2009\u00b1\u2009222.3 versus 417.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009163.8\u00a0mL) and transfusion (335.2\u2009\u00b1\u200958.7 versus 224.8\u2009\u00b1\u200976.2\u00a0mL) was significantly greater in the Pringle group (\u2009<\u20090.05). The Pringle group was associated with significantly lower postoperative albumin and higher C-reactive protein levels on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7 (\u2009<\u20090.05). Laparoscopic hepatectomy for tumors in segment 7 can be performed safely and effectively with successful exposure of surgical field and proper hepatic blood flow occlusion. Continuous half-Pringle maneuver offers the advantages of less operative time and blood loss, less injury, and better recovery.",

There are five connotations including water shutoff on total block, deep water shutoff, selective water shutoff, water shut-off for different water sources and water shutoff combining with other stimulations. These connotations are mutual relations as a whole, and each of them has its technical keys. The water shutoff on total block needs a decision-making method for selecting wells in water shutoff. The deep water shutoff needs proper agents, placement method and determining method for reasonable depth. The selective water shutoff makes use of selective water shut off agent and selective injecting method. According to the characteristics of the sources of water, different methods for water shutoff in oil wells should be designed. Better results of water shutoff combining with other stimulations can be obtained by the complement of action with each other. Comprehending those connotations of water shutoff and its technical keys can make water shutoff in oil wells as an important method for enhancing oil recovery.",

This technique took fully advantages of selective plugging effect of water-based blocking agent and gravity segregation resulted from density contrast of oil and water and could control water coning by gel barrier in vicinity of oil-water interface. Three operating fluids including high-density brine, gellant and over-displacing fluids were used for this technique. The behaviors of these fluids and their construction process were tested and theoretically researched. Since October 2003, eight oil wells in thin oil reservoir with bottom water in Luliang Oilfield have been constructed using this technique successfully. By August 2005, the oil production of these wells increased by 2622 tons, and the water production decreased by 4968 cubic meters. Declined water cut of mass production ranged from 11.3% to 38.4%. The result of field experiment confirmed that the technique is effective for controlling water coning in thin oil reservoir with bottom water.",

Due to the rapid developments of mobile devices, especially smart phones, more and more sensitive information is now stored or accessible on smart phones. How to protect smart phonesu0027 security is now more important than ever. Unfortunately, because of the special features of smart phones such as computational limitations and input constraints, existing MFA schemes could not be directly used on smart phones. In this paper, we propose a new concept of Variable-Factor Authentication (VFA) for smart phones. VFA dynamically adjusts the number of authentication factors based on whether a user is suspicious or not. We implement a prototype to exam the performance. The experiment results show that, compared to MFA, VFA provides significant convenience to legitimate users whereas maintain the security protection to suspicious users.

However, in recent, based on the convenience of random domains, some cybercriminals have utilized them to launch DNS water torture attack, a kind of DDoS attack targeting on the authoritative servers. Most of the Researchers dedicate in analyzing the random domains used for DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) malware C&C communication rather than the DNS water torture attack. In order to get more facts about the nature of this kind of attacks, we compare behaviors of the DNS water torture attack with the DGA malware and disposable service from three aspects, i.e., time pattern, lexical property and the participants (clients and victims). Based on a month of real-world DNS traffic, we find that, first, the volume of the DNS water torture attack is significantly larger than the volume of disposable domains and DGA queries. Second, the character distribution of domains generated in the DNS water torture attacks are more random than disposable domains and DGA domains. Third, the client IP launching the DNS water torture attack are all random generated fake addresses. Fourth, the victims are themselves lawbreaker, e.g., pornographic website and gambling website. At last, we give some advices based on the analysis result to mitigate the DNS water torture attack.\n\n",

        "abstract": "SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system is the core component of industrial and critical infrastructure, and cyber security of SCADA system has become the key consideration of system managers and engineers. Therefore, a great many of standards, guidelines and best practices have been developed to give reference of SCADA system cyber security, hoping to provide some instructions for system managers. Unfortunately, there is little consensus on what to do. Whats worse, it is difficult to choose the right one for a particular industrial scene. These standards are usually long and complex texts, whose reading and understanding often takes much time and effort. We provide a comprehensive and structured review of SCADA cyber security standards, guidelines and best practices with three dimensions: release time, geographic location and intended audience. Finally, we use the theory of defense-in-depth as a reference to evaluate these standards. It is concluded that no standard performs better than others on all the criteria and that we should integrate different standards to apply them to a specific industrial scene.",

        "abstract": "Extreme learning machine (ELM) for regression has been used in many fields because of its easy-implementation, fast training speed and good generalization performance. However, basic ELM with \u017a2-norm loss function is sensitive to outliers. Recently, \u017a1-norm loss function and Huber loss function have been used in ELM to enhance the robustness. However, the \u017a1-norm loss function and the Huber loss function can also be effected by outliers because of their linear correlation with the errors. Moreover, existing robust ELM methods only use \u017a2-norm regularization or have no regularization term. In this study, we propose a unified model for robust regularized ELM regression using iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), and call it RELM-IRLS. We perform a comprehensive study on the robust loss function and regularization term for robust ELM regression. Four loss functions (i.e., \u017a1-norm, Huber, Bisquare and Welsch) are used to enhance the robustness, and two types of regularization (\u017a2-norm and \u017a1-norm) are used to avoid overfitting. Experiments show that our proposed RELM-IRLS with \u017a2-norm and \u017a1-norm regularization is stable and accurate for data with 0 ~ 40 % outlier levels, and that RELM-IRLS with \u017a1-norm regularization can obtain a compact network because of the highly sparse output weights of the network.",

        "abstract": "Learning to rank algorithm has become important in recent years due to its successful application in information retrieval, recommender system, and computational biology, and so forth. Ranking support vector machine (RankSVM) is one of the state-of-art ranking models and has been favorably used. Nonlinear RankSVM (RankSVM with nonlinear kernels) can give higher accuracy than linear RankSVM (RankSVM with a linear kernel) for complex nonlinear ranking problem. However, the learning methods for nonlinear RankSVM are still time-consuming because of the calculation of kernel matrix. In this paper, we propose a fast ranking algorithm based on kernel approximation to avoid computing the kernel matrix. We explore two types of kernel approximation methods, namely, the Nystr\u00f6m method and random Fourier features. Primal truncated Newton method is used to optimize the pairwise L2-loss (squared Hinge-loss) objective function of the ranking model after the nonlinear kernel approximation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method gets a much faster training speed than kernel RankSVM and achieves comparable or better performance over state-of-the-art ranking algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Though it has been easier to build large face datasets by collecting images from the Internet in this Big Data era, the time-consuming manual annotation process prevents researchers from constructing larger ones, which makes the automatic cleaning of noisy labels highly desirable. However, identifying mislabeled faces by machine is quite challenging because the diversity of a person's face images that are captured wildly at all ages is extraordinarily rich. In view of this, we propose a graph-based cleaning method that mainly employs the community detection algorithm and deep CNN models to delete mislabeled images. As the diversity of faces is preserved in multiple large communities, our cleaning results have both high cleanness and rich data diversity. With our method, we clean the extremely large MS-Celeb-1M face dataset (approximately 10 million images with noisy labels) and obtain a clean version of it called C-MS-Celeb (6,464,018 images of 94,682 celebrities). By training a single-net model using our C-MS-Celeb dataset, without fine-tuning, we achieve 99.67% at Equal Error Rate on the LFW face recognition benchmark, which is comparable to other state-of-the-art results. This demonstrates the data cleaning positive effects on the model training. To the best of our knowledge, our C-MS-Celeb is the largest clean face dataset that is publicly available so far, which will benefit face recognition researchers.",

Researchers have been increasingly trying to model the potential relations between different candidate algorithms for the algorithm selection. In this study, we propose an instancespecific algorithm selection method based on multi-output learning, which can manage these relations more directly. Three kinds of multi-output learning methods are used to predict the performances of the candidate algorithms: (1) multi-output regressor stacking; (2) multi-output extremely randomized trees; and (3) hybrid single-output and multioutput trees. The experimental results obtained using 11 SAT datasets and 5 MaxSAT datasets indicate that our proposed methods can obtain a better performance over the state-of-the-art algorithm selection methods.",

Over expression of MPS1 correlated with a wide range of human tumors makes it an attractive target for finding an effective and specific inhibitor. In this work, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of protein MPS1 itself as well as protein bound systems with the inhibitor and natural substrate based on crystal structures. The reported orally bioavailable 1h-pyrrolo [3,2-c] pyridine inhibitors of MPS1 maintained stable binding in the catalytic site while natural substrate ATP could not stay. Comparative study of stability and flexibility of three systems reveals position shifting of \u03b2-sheet region within the catalytic site, which indicates inhibition mechanism was through stabilizing the \u03b2-sheet region. Binding free energies calculated with MM-GB/PBSA method shows different binding affinity for inhibitor and ATP. Finally, interactions between protein and inhibitor during molecular dynamic simulations were measured and counted. Residue Gly605 and Leu654 were suggested as important hot spots for stable binding of inhibitor by molecular dynamic simulation. Our results reveal an important position shifting within catalytic site for non-inhibited proteins. Together with hot spots found by molecular dynamic simulation, the results provide important information of inhibition mechanism and will be referenced for designing novel inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The development of biocompatible chemosensors is becoming increasingly important for chemical analyses in environmental sampling, the food industry, and clinical medicine. Many current chemosensors have limited utility as they represent potential secondary pollutants. To circumvent this problem, researchers are evaluating peptide-based fluorescent chemosensors because of their well-established synthesis protocols, good biological compatibility, and generally low cytotoxicity, which makes them suitable for bioimaging. In this study, we report the development of a peptide-based fluorescent chemosensor  HL  (fluorophore-Cys-Pro-Gly-His) for divalent zinc ions (Zn 2+ ). The objective of this study was to select a suitable peptide sequence and associated fluorophore exhibiting high selectivity and sensitivity to Zn 2+ -binding, and enhanced fluorescent response. Results of this study, both  in vitro  and in living cells, indicated that  HL  exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity for Zn 2+ , with a limit of detection (LOD) of about 82\u00a0nM. The sensor also exhibited very low cell cytotoxicity and strong fluorescence emission in living cells, which indicates that it may find application as a novel chemosensor for selective Zn 2+  detection in biological environments.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the design and application of peptide-based fluorescent chemical sensors has been the subject of extensive research due to several technological advantages, including the technological maturity of solid phase peptide synthesis and side chain modifications, and the fact that peptide-based fluorescent chemical sensors exhibit good water solubility, biocompatibility and low toxicity, making them widely-applicable in environmental monitoring, bioimaging, medical diagnosis and disease treatment. The recognition mode of peptide-based fluorescent chemical sensors can be easily realized by different recognition mechanisms, such as photoinduced electron transfer (PET), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF). Here we report the design and synthesis of a peptide-based fluorescent chemical sensor (DSH sensor: Dansyl-Ser-Pro-Gly-His-Trp-Gly) for detecting Zn2+, based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from tryptophan (donor) to the dansyl fluorophore (acceptor). Results of this study indicate that the DSH sensor has potent selectivity and sensitivity to Zn2+, with an approximate limit of detection (LOD) of 124 nM in vitro. In addition, the DSH sensor can penetrate cells, exhibit low toxicity and stable fluorescence emission intensity, and may detect the concentration of Zn2+ in a complex biological environment for live cell imaging.",

        "abstract": "Recently, character model based on integrated convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep bidirectional long short-term memory (DBLSTM) has been demonstrated to be effective for online handwritten Chinese text recognition (HCTR). However, the reported CNN-DBLSTM topologies are too complex to be practically useful. In this paper, we propose a compact CNN-DBLSTM which has small footprint and low computation cost yet be able to accommodate multiple receptive fields for CNN-based feature extraction. By using the training set of a popular benchmark database, namely CASIA-OLHWDB, we trained a compact CNN-DBLSTM by a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion with a multi-step training strategy. Combined this character model with a character trigram language model, our online HCTR system with a WFSTbased decoder has achieved state-of-the-art performance on both CASIA and ICDAR-2013 Chinese handwriting recognition competition test sets.",

        "abstract": "The accuracy of a typical state-of-the-art optical character recognition (OCR) system benefits greatly from using a language model (LM). However, a conventional LM has a limited vocabulary, resulting in out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words that cannot be recognized by the OCR system. In this paper, we present an open vocabulary OCR system based on a hybrid LM. The vocabulary of the hybrid LM consists of both words and subwords. OOV words can be generated by combinations of subwords. A refined hybrid LM training scheme is applied by interpolating a standard hybrid LM, a word-based LM and a subword-based LM. An efficient word combination method is performed by modeling optional space symbols in a decoding network. The overall system deals with OOV words in a general, data-driven and language-independent way. We conduct experiments on an English handwriting OCR task. Evaluations on three testing sets demonstrate that the OCR system with the proposed method achieves a word error rate of 33.4% on an OOV-only testing set, yet without degrading the recognition accuracies on the other two testing sets mainly consisting of in-vocabulary words.",

        "abstract": "Recently, character model based on integrated convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep bidirectional long short-term memory (DBLSTM) has achieved excellent performance for offline handwriting recognition (HWR). To deploy CNN-DBLSTM model in products, it is necessary to reduce the footprint and runtime latency as much as possible. In this paper, we study two methods to compress the CNN part: (1) Use Tucker decomposition to decompose pre-trained weights with low-rank approximation, followed by fine-tuning; (2) Use grouped convolution to construct sparse connections in channel domain. Experiments have been conducted on a large-scale offline English HWR task to compare the effectiveness of the above two techniques. Our results show that using Tucker decomposition alone offers a good solution to building a compact CNN-DBLSTM model which can reduce significantly both the footprint and latency yet without degrading recognition accuracy.",

In this paper, we use a teacher-student learning approach to achieve this goal, where a new objective function is proposed to match the extracted CNN feature sequences of the teacher and student models under the guidance of the succeeding LSTM layer.

Al(OH) nanoparticles modified hydroxyapatite (Al-HAP) nanowires were developed and made into Al-HAP membrane. The adsorption data of Al-HAP adsorbent could be well described by Freundlich isotherm model while the adsorption kinetic followed pseudo-second-order model. The maximum of adsorption capacity was 93.84mg/g when the fluoride concentration was 200mg/L. The adsorption mechanism was anion exchanges and electrostatic interactions. The contribution rates of HAP nanowires and Al(OH) nanoparticles in fluoride removal were 36.70% and 63.30%, respectively. The fixed-bed column test demonstrate that the Al-HAP was biocompatible and in a good stability during the process of water treatment. The fluoride removal abilities of Al-HAP membrane with 0.3mm thickness could reach 1568L/m when fluoride concentrations were 5mg/L. This study indicated that the Al-HAP membrane could be developed into a very viable technology for highly effective removal of fluoride from drinking water.",

Both the adsorption and membrane technique were used for the removal of organic micropollutants. The hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the HAP adsorbent and membrane were tunable by controlling the surface structure of HAP. The adsorption of organic micropollutants on the HAP adsorbent was studied in batch experiments. The adsorption process was fit with the Freundlich model, while the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model. The HAP membrane could remove organic micropollutants effectively by dynamic adsorption in both aqueous and ethanol solutions. The removal efficiencies of organic micropollutants depended on the solution composition, membrane thickness and hydrophilicity, flow rate, and the initial concentration of organic micropollutants. The adsorption capacities of the HAP membrane with a sandwich structure (membrane thickness was 0.3\u00a0mm) were 6700, 6510, 6310, 5960, 5490, 5230, 4980 and 4360\u00a0L\u00a0m for 1-naphthyl amine, 2-naphthol, bisphenol S, propranolol hydrochloride, metolachlor, ethinyl oestradiol, 2,4-dichlorophenol and bisphenol A, respectively, when the initial concentration was 3.0\u00a0mg\u00a0L. The biocompatible HAP adsorption membrane can be easily regenerated by methanol and was thus demonstrated to be a novel concept for the removal of organic micropollutants from both aqueous and organic solutions.",

        "abstract": "Novel ultralong hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanowires were successfully prepared for fluoride removal for the first time. The fluoride adsorption on the HAP nanowires was studied on a batch mode. The results revealed that the adsorption data could be well described by the Freundlich model, and the adsorption kinetic followed the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum of adsorption capacity was 40.65mg/g at pH 7.0 when the fluoride concentration is 200mg/L. The thermodynamic parameters suggested that the adsorption of fluoride was a spontaneous endothermic process. The FT-IR, XPS and Zeta potential analysis revealed that both anion exchange and electrostatic interactions were involved in the adsorption of fluoride. Furthermore, the HAP nanowires were made into HAP membrane through a simple process of suction filtration. Membrane filtration experiments revealed that the fluoride removal capabilities depended on the membrane thickness, flow rate and initial concentration of fluoride. The as-prepared membrane could remove fluoride efficiently through continues filtration. The filtered water amount could reach 350, 192, and 64L/m(2) when the fluoride concentrations were 4, 5 and 8ppm, respectively, using the HAP membrane with only 150\u03bcm thickness. The as-synthesized ultralong HAP nanowires were thus demonstrated to be very effective and biocompatible adsorbents for fluoride removal from contaminated water.",

The adsorbent was characterized and its performance in fluoride (F(-)) removal was evaluated for the first time. Kinetic data reveal that the F(-) adsorption is rapid in the beginning followed by a slower adsorption process; 75.9% adsorption can be achieved within 1min and only 16% additional removal occurred in the following 239min. The F(-) adsorption kinetics was well described by the pseudo second-order kinetic model. The calculated adsorption capacity of this adsorbent for F(-) by Langmuir model was 400mgg(-1) at pH 6.5, which is one of the highest capabilities of today's materials. The thermodynamic parameters calculated from the temperature-dependent isotherms indicate that the adsorption reaction of F(-) on the HAO is a spontaneous process. The FT-IR spectra of HAO before and after adsorbing F(-) show adsorption mechanism should be hydroxyl and oxalate interchange with F(-).",

Foaming agent HY-6 of salt resistance can be used for the profile control of the high salinity formation of some oilfields. The enhanced oil recovery mechanism of foam displacement systems are studied by means of visual glass sand pack. The results show that injecting a certain amount of polymer slug before injecting foam system is advantageous to increasing sweep efficiency. The best one among four foam injection patterns is 0.1% (mass fraction) polymer YG100 slug of 0.1PV+0.3% (mass fraction) surfactant HY-6 slug of 0.3PV + main foam slug of 0.5PV. The enhanced oil recovery mechanism of foam system is mainly Jamin effect, plugging high-permeability regions and increasing the sweep efficiency of low-permeability regions. In addition, gas driving and diluted surfactant driving are formed in the front of foam slug because of the defoaming effect of oil, which can obviously improve the displacement efficiency of high-permeability regions.",

Honokiol, a pharmacologically active natural compound derived from the bark of Magnolia officinalis, has antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus which provides a great inspiration for the discovery of potential antibacterial agents. Herein, honokiol derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against S. aureus ATCC25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC25922 in vitro. 7c exhibited better antibacterial activity than other derivatives and honokiol. The structure-activity relationships indicated piperidine ring with amino group is helpful to improve antibacterial activity. Further more, 7c showed broad spectrum antibacterial efficiency against various bacterial strains including eleven gram-positive and seven gram-negative species. Time-kill kinetics against S. aureus ATCC25923 in vitro revealed that 7c displayed a concentration-dependent effect and more rapid bactericidal kinetics better than linezolid and vancomycin with the same concentration. Gram staining assays of S. aureus ATCC25923 suggested that 7c could destroy the cell walls of bacteria at 1\u00d7MIC and 4\u00d7MIC.",

Honokiol, as a well-known natural product in Chinese herbal medicine Houpu, is finally being studied in a Phase I clinical trial (CTR20170822) in patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLS) in China this year. During the honokiol liposome formulation process, five major impurities were present in the range of 0.05-0.1% based on the HPLC analysis. These five major impurities were obtained from the forced degradation product of honokiol through countercurrent chromatography and prep-HPLC. The structure were elucidated with H NMR, C NMR, 2D NMR and MS spectral data. The proposed HPLC method was validated for specificity, linearity (concentration range 0.01-1.62, 0.003-0.96, 0.05-7.98, 0.04-6.52, 0.03-5.18\u202f\u03bcg/ml for impurities I-V respectively, R2\u202f>\u202f0.9988), accuracy (99.11-100.67%), precision (CV\u202f<\u202f1.6%), and sensitivity (LOD 3.3, 0.1, 16.7, 13.3, 10.0\u202fng/ml for impurities I-V respectively). The validated method was employed in the further study of the honokiol drug substance.",

        "abstract": "EGFR T790\u202fM accounts for 50% to 60% of cases of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) resistance to the first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, identifying novel compounds with activity against TKIs resistant is of great value. In this study, twenty honokiol and magnolol derivatives were isolated from the EtOH extract of Magnolia officinalis and the antiproliferative activity was evaluated on HCC827 (19del EGFR mutation), H1975 (L858\u202fR/T790\u202fM EGFR mutation), and H460 (KRAS mutation) cell lines. Among the isolated compounds, piperitylmagnolol (a 3-substituted magnolol derivative) showed the best antiproliferative activity against those three cell lines with the IC values of 15.85, 15.60 and 18.60\u202f\u03bcM, respectively, which provided a direction for the structural modification of magnolol. Further structural modification led to the synthesis of thirty-one magnolol derivatives, and compounds A13, C1, and C2 exhibited significant and broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity with the IC values ranging from 4.81 to 13.54\u202f\u03bcM, which were approximately 4- and 8-fold more potent than those of honokiol and magnolol, respectively. Moreover, their aqueous solubility was remarkably improved with 12-, 400- and 10 fold greater than those of honokiol and magnolol. Anti-tumor mechanism research revealed that these three compounds were able to induce cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, cause efficient apoptosis in H1975\u202fcells, and also prevent the migration of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner through Cdk2, Cdk4, Cyclin E, and Cyclin D1 inhibition as well as up-regulation of cleaved-PARP and cleaved-caspase 3 levels. In in\u00a0vivo antitumor activity, C2 (10, 30 and 100\u202fmg/kg, po) dose-dependently inhibited the tumor growth in H1975 xenograft model with the tumor inhibition rate of 46.3%, 59.3% and 61.2% respectively, suggesting that C2 is a potential oral anticancer agent deserving further investigation.",

The structures of the new compounds were determined by 1D and 2D NMR, and by HRMS. The anti-inflammatory activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 cells. Among the isolated compounds, compounds  1 ,  2  and  14  showed significant anti-inflammatory activity with IC 50  values of 20.4, 2.1 and 35.7\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively and no obvious toxicities were observed at 100\u00a0\u03bcM. Western blot and PCR assay further showed that inhibition of nitric oxide production by compound  2  was associated with suppression of iNOS expression. Modeling studies suggested that the amino group, phenyl ring as well as the isopentenyl tails of compound  2  could help bind to iNOs.",

The structures of these compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including IR, 1D and 2D NMR as well as by high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis. The anti-inflammatory activities and the cytotoxic effects were evaluated on lipopolysaccharide induced nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 cells and two tumor cell lines (MCF-7 and A2780s), respectively. Results showed that compounds  1  and  3  exhibited weak anti-inflammatory activity with the IC 50  value of 18.50 and 10.51\u202f\u03bcM respectively, while all compounds were inactive in both cell lines (IC 50  u003e 20\u202f\u03bcM).",

        "abstract": "In this study, systematic separation and subsequent pharmacological activity studies were carried out to identify cytotoxic natural products from the dried stems of  Drake. Five previously undescribed isoflavones, pachyvones A-E; one previously undescribed xanthone, pachythone A; and twenty-two known compounds were obtained. The structures of these compounds were assigned on the basis of 1D/2D NMR data and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy analysis. Preliminary activity screening with HeLa and MCF-7 cells showed that ten compounds (-, , , -, , and ) had potential cytotoxicity. Further in-depth activity studies with five cancer cell lines (HeLa, HepG2, MCF-7, Hct116, and MDA-MB-231) and one normal cell line (HUVEC) revealed that these ten compounds showed specific cytotoxicity in cancer cells, with IC values ranging from 5 to 40\u202f\u03bcM, while they had no effect on normal cell lines. To investigate whether the cytotoxicity of these ten compounds was associated with autophagy, their autophagic effects were evaluated in GFP-LC3-HeLa cells. The results demonstrated that compound  (durmillone) significantly induced autophagy in a concentration-dependent manner and had the best activity as an autophagy inducer among all of the compounds. Therefore, compound  was selected for further study. The PI/Annexin V double staining assay and Western blotting results revealed that compound  also induced obvious apoptosis in HeLa and MCF-7 cells, which suggests that it mediates cytotoxic activity through activation of both apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, this study identified ten natural cytotoxic products from the dried stems of  Drake, of which compound  induced apoptosis and autophagy and could be an anticancer drug candidate.",

The cellular mechanisms of the conjugate were explored, and the therapeutic indexes were studied as well. The high molecular weight (MW) polymeric conjugate (94 kDa) was degraded into products with low MW (45 kDa) in the presence of lysosomal cathepsin B and also showed pH-responsive drug release behavior. In vitro cellular mechanism studies revealed that the polymeric conjugate was uptaken by the 4T1 cells, leading to cell apoptosis and cytotoxicity to cancer cells, while the polymeric conjugate demonstrated excellent in vivo biosafety even at a high dose. Compared to free DOX, the conjugate has a much longer half-life in pharmacokinetics and accumulates in tumors with a much higher amount. The conjugate therefore has a much greater in vivo anticancer efficacy against 4T1 xenograft tumors and shows subtle side-effects, which were confirmed via tumor size and weight, immunohistochemistry and histological studies. Overall, this polymeric conjugate may be used as an enzyme/pH-sensitive anticancer agent.",

        "abstract": "Advances of nanoscale systems for cancer treatment have been involved in enabling highly regulated site-specific localization to sub cellular organelles hidden beneath cell membranes. Thus far, the cellular entry of these nanoscale systems has been not fully understood. Endocytosisis a form of active transport in which cell transports elected extracellular molecules (such as proteins, viruses, micro-organisms and nanoscale systems) are allowed into cell interiors by engulfing them in an energy-dependent process. This process appears at the plasma membrane surface and contains internalization of the cell membrane as well as the membrane proteins and lipids of cell. There are multiform pathways of endocytosis for nanoscale systems. Further comprehension for the mechanisms of endocytosis is achieved with a combination of efficient genetic manipulations, cell dynamic imaging, and chemical endocytosis inhibitors. This review provides an account of various endocytic pathways, itemizes current methods to study endocytosis of nanoscale systems, discusses some factors associated with cellular uptake for nanoscale systems and introduces the trafficking behavior for nanoscale systems with active targeting. An insight into the endocytosis mechanism is urgent and significant for developing safe and efficient nanoscale systems for cancer diagnosis and therapy.",

        "abstract": "A PEGylated multi-stimuli responsive dendritic copolymer-doxorubicin prodrug-based nanoscale system was developed as a delivery model for hydrophobic drugs. In this system, PEGylation did not only prolong circulation of the nanoscale system in the body (average half-life of 14.6 h, four time longer than that of free drug), but also allowed the system to aggregate into nanoscale particles (NPs) due to interactions between hydrophilic (PEG) and hydrophobic (dendritic prodrug) moieties for better uptake through endocytosis (around 150 nm of particle size with a neutrally charged surface for the PEGylated dendritic prodrug with 12.1 wt% of DOX). The dendritic structure was built by bridging poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (polyHPMA) segments with enzyme-responsive GFLG linkers, and DOX was released by hydrolyzing the hydrazone bond between DOX and the copolymer framework in the acidic endosomes/lysosomes. In vitro studies on 4T1 cells DOX released from the NPs induced mitochondrial dysfunction during apoptosis. By Imaging main organs and tumor tissues from mice treated with the NPs, boosted accumulation of this nanoscale medicine was found in tumor tissues, leading to a decrease in toxic and side effects to normal tissues and enhancement in drug tolerance. In the 4T1 breast cancer model, these NPs exhibited a superior antitumor efficacy confirmed by inhibiting angiogenesis, proliferation of tumor tissues and inducing procedural apoptosis of tumor cells. The highest tumor growth inhibition (TGI) value mediated by the NPs was up to 86.5%. Therefore, this PEGylated multi-stimuli responsive dendritic copolymer-DOX prodrug-based nanoscale system may be further explored as an alternative to traditional chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "In an attempt to improve the therapeutic indices of gemcitabine (GEM), a prodrug was designed by conjugating GEM with a stimuli-responsive dendritic polyHPMA copolymer (dendritic polyHPMA-GEM) and synthesized using the one-pot method of RAFT polymerization. The prodrug with dendritic architectures was able to aggregate and form stable nanoscale systems in the order of 46 nm. The high molecular weight (HMW, 168 kDa) dendritic prodrug could biodegrade into segments of low molecular weight (LMW, 29 kDa) for excretion. The prodrug demonstrates enzyme-responsive drug release features; over 95% GEM was released from the carrier in the presence of cathepsin B within 3 h. Investigation of the cellular mechanism underlying the dendritic prodrug suggests that cytotoxicity is associated with cellular uptake and cell apoptosis. The prodrug shows good hemocompatibility and in vivo biosafety. In particular, the dendritic polymer prodrug displays high accumulation within tumors and markedly improved in vivo antitumor activity in the 4T1 murine breast cancer model compared to free GEM. The in vivo antitumor activities are characterized by a marked suppression in tumor volumes indicating much higher tumor growth inhibition (TGI, 83%) than that in GEM treatment (TGI, 36%). In addition, some tumors were eliminated. The tumor xenograft immunohistochemistry study clearly indicates that tumor apoptosis occurs through antiangiogenic effects. These results suggest that the stimuli-responsive dendritic polymer-gemcitabine has great potential as an efficient anticancer agent.",

        "abstract": "Polymer-drug conjugates has significantly improved the anti-tumor efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs and alleviated their side effects. N-(1,3-dihydroxypropan-2-yl) methacrylamide (DHPMA) copolymer was synthesized via RAFT polymerization and polymer-doxorubicin (DOX) (diblock pDHPMA-DOX) were formed by conjugation, resulting in a self-aggregation-induced nanoprodrug with a favorable size of 21 nm and great stability. The nanoprodrug with a molecular weight (MW) of 95 kDa released drugs in response to tumor microenvironmental pH variations and they were enzymatically hydrolyzed into low MW segments (45 kDa). The nanoprodrug was transported through the endolysosomal pathway, released the drug into the cytoplasm and some was localized in the mitochondria, resulting in disruption of the cellular actin cytoskeleton. Cellular apoptosis was also associated with reduction in the mitochondrial potential caused by the nanoprodrug. Notably, the nanoprodrug had a significantly prolonged blood circulation time with an elimination half time of 9.8 h, displayed high accumulation within tumors, and improved the in vivo therapeutic efficacy against 4T1 xenograft tumors compared to free DOX. The tumor xenograft immunohistochemistry study clearly indicated tumor inhibition was through the inhibition of cell proliferation and antiangiogenic effects. Our studies demonstrated that the diblock pDHPMA-DOX nanoprodrug with a controlled molecular structure is promising to alleviate adverse effects of free DOX and have a great potential as an efficient anticancer agent. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this work, we prepared a biodegradable diblock DHPMA polymer-doxorubicin conjugate via one-pot of RAFT polymerization and conjugate chemistry. The conjugate-based nanoprodrug was internalized by endocytosis to intracellularly release DOX and further induce disruption of mitochondrial functions, actin cytoskeleton alterations and cellular apoptosis. The nanoprodrug with a high molecular weight (MW) (95 kDa) showed a long blood circulation time and achieved high accumulation into tumors. The nanoprodrug was degraded into low MW (\u223c45 kDa) products below the renal threshold, which ensured its biosafety. Additionally, the multi-stimuli-responsive nanoprodrug demonstrated an enhanced antitumor efficacy against 4T1 breast tumors and alleviated side effects, showing a great potential as an efficient and safe anticancer agent.",

        "abstract": "It is in a great demand to design a biodegradable, tumor microenvironment-sensitive drug delivery system to achieve safe and highly efficacious treatment of cancer. Herein, a novel pH/enzyme sensitive dendritic pdiHPMADOX conjugate was designed. diHPMA dendritic copolymer with GFLG segments in the branches which are sensitive to the intracellular enzyme of the tumor was prepared through RAFT polymerization. DOX was attached to dendritic diHPMA polymer through a pH-sensitive hydrazone bond. The dendritic pdiHPMA-DOX conjugate self-assembled into nanoparticles with an ideal spherical shape at a mean size of 103 nm. The DOX attached to the polymeric carrier was released in an acidic environment, and the GFLG linker for synthesizing the dendritic vehicle with a high molecular weight (MW, 220 kDa) was cleaved to release low MW segments (<40 kDa) in the presence of cathepsin B. The dendritic polymeric conjugate was internalized via an endocytic pathway, and then released the anticancer drug, which led to significant cytotoxicity for tumors. The blood circulation time was profoundly prolonged, resulting in high accumulation of DOX into tumors. In vivo anti-tumor experiments with 4T1 tumor bearing mice demonstrated that the conjugate had a better antitumor efficacy in comparison with free DOX. Additionally, body weight measurements and histological examinations indicated that the conjugate showed low toxicities to normal tissues. This dendritic polymeric drug carrier in a response to intracellular enzyme and acidic pH of tumor tissue or cells holds great promise in tumor-targeted therapy.",

        "abstract": "In an attempt to improve the therapeutic indices of gemcitabine (GEM), a prodrug was designed by conjugating GEM with a stimuli-responsive dendritic polyHPMA copolymer (dendritic polyHPMA-GEM) and synthesized using the one-pot method of RAFT polymerization. The prodrug with dendritic architectures was able to aggregate and form stable nanoscale systems in the order of 46 nm. The high molecular weight (HMW, 168 kDa) dendritic prodrug could biodegrade into segments of low molecular weight (LMW, 29 kDa) for excretion. The prodrug demonstrates enzyme-responsive drug release features; over 95% GEM was released from the carrier in the presence of cathepsin B within 3 h. Investigation of the cellular mechanism underlying the dendritic prodrug suggests that cytotoxicity is associated with cellular uptake and cell apoptosis. The prodrug shows good hemocompatibility and in vivo biosafety. In particular, the dendritic polymer prodrug displays high accumulation within tumors and markedly improved in vivo antitumor activity in the 4T1 murine breast cancer model compared to free GEM. The in vivo antitumor activities are characterized by a marked suppression in tumor volumes indicating much higher tumor growth inhibition (TGI, 83%) than that in GEM treatment (TGI, 36%). In addition, some tumors were eliminated. The tumor xenograft immunohistochemistry study clearly indicates that tumor apoptosis occurs through antiangiogenic effects. These results suggest that the stimuli-responsive dendritic polymer-gemcitabine has great potential as an efficient anticancer agent.",

        "abstract": "DNA methylation increases with age. The objective of this study was to investigate whether compound H, a potential activator of DNA demethylases, attenuates aging-related arterial stiffness and hypertension. Aged mice (24-27\u00a0months) and adult mice (12\u00a0months) were used. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), a direct measure of arterial stiffness, and blood pressure (BP) were increased significantly in aged mice. Notably, daily treatments with compound H (15\u00a0mg/kg, IP) for 2\u00a0weeks significantly attenuated the aging-related increases in PWV and BP. Compound H abolished aging-associated downregulation of secreted Klotho (SKL) levels in both kidneys and serum likely by enhancing DNA demethylase activity and decreasing DNA methylation. Aging-related arterial stiffness was associated with accumulation of stiffer collagen and degradation of compliant elastin which are accompanied by increased expression of MMP2, MMP9, TGF-\u03b21, and TGF-\u03b23. These changes were effectively attenuated by compound H, suggesting rejuvenation of aged arteries. Compound H also rescued downregulation of Sirt1 deacetylase, AMPK\u03b1, and eNOS activities in aortas of aged mice. In cultured smooth muscle cells (SMCc) Klotho-deficient serum upregulated expression of MMPs and TGF\u03b2 which, however, was not affected by compound H. In conclusion, compound H attenuates aging-associated arterial stiffness and hypertension by activation of DNA demethylase which increases renal SKL expression and consequently circulating SKL levels leading to activation of the Sirt1-AMPK-eNOS pathway in aortas of aged mice.",

However, the underlying mechanisms of heart aging are less clear. Methods and Results: We found that the overall heart size, heart weight, and cardiomyocyte size were increased in aged mice (24 months). Cardiac fibrosis was also found in old mice. Therefore, aging induced cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. Concomitantly, heart function declined significantly in aged mice, as evidenced by decreases in fraction shorting, ejection fraction, left ventricular stroke volume, and cardiac output. Renal and circulating Klotho levels were dramatically decreased, suggesting that there may be association between a decrease in Klotho and heart failure in aged mice. Using Klotho mutant homozygous (KL-/-) mice, we found that Klotho deficiency caused cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Interestingly, treatment with secreted Klotho prevented cardiac hypertrophy, remodeling and heart failure in aged ...",

        "abstract": "Background: Aortic valve calcification and aortic stenosis is one of the most prevalent forms of cardiovascular disease in the developed countries. Currently there is no effective therapeutic treatment for aortic valve disease (AVD) due to its unclear mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to explore the molecular mechanism of the initiation of aortic valve calcification and the role klotho is playing in the prevention of the development of the calcification. Methods u0026 Results: Western blots showed impaired canonical NF-\u03baB(P65) pathway and osteoclast functions in the calcified human aortic valves. Homozygous Klotho knock-out (KL-/-) mice developed hyperphosphatemia, decreased osteoclast activities (NF-\u03baB P65, TRAP and Cathespin K expression level) and showed severe calcification on the aortic valves. In cultured human aortic valve interstitial cells (HAVICs), treatment of osteogenesis condition medium disrupted RANK-RANKL/OPG axis and the NF-\u03baB P65-dependent osteoclast function within 2 hours, which wer...",

        "abstract": "Background u0026 Objective: The heart function declines in the aged population. At age 80 years, LV contractile function is less than half of what it was at age 20 years. Aging is a recognized risk factor for heart diseases. For instance, the prevalence of heart disease increases with age. The mortality from heart diseases is higher in the aged than in the young population. Klotho is a recently discovered anti-aging gene that is primarily expressed in kidneys. The secreted Klotho is released into blood. The objective of this study is to investigate if a decline serum Klotho levels contributes to aging-related heart failure. Method u0026 Results: The results showed that ejection fraction, stroke volume and cardiac output were decreased in aged mice (24 months) vs. the adult mice (10 months), indicating that aging impairs heart function. The serum level of Klotho was decreased significantly in aged mice. Interestingly, daily injection of recombinant Klotho protein rescued the aging-related decline in heart function...",

        "abstract": "Deficiency of the antiaging gene Klotho (KL) induces renal damage and hypertension through unknown mechanisms. In this study, we assessed whether KL regulates expression of CYP11B2, a key rate-limiting enzyme in aldosterone synthesis, in adrenal glands. We found that haplodeficiency of KL(+/-) in mice increased the plasma level of aldosterone by 16 weeks of age, which coincided with spontaneous and persistent elevation of BP. Blockade of aldosterone actions by eplerenone reversed KL deficiency-induced hypertension and attenuated the kidney damage. Protein expression of CYP11B2 was upregulated in adrenal cortex of KL(+/-) mice. KL and CYP11B2 proteins colocalized in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells. Silencing of KL upregulated and overexpression of KL downregulated CYP11B2 expression in human adrenocortical cells. Notably, silencing of KL decreased expression of SF-1, a negative transcription factor of CYP11B2, but increased phosphorylation of ATF2, a positive transcription factor of CYP11B2, which may contribute to upregulation of CYP11B2 expression. Therefore, these results show that KL regulates adrenal CYP11B2 expression. KL deficiency-induced spontaneous hypertension and kidney damage may be partially attributed to the upregulation of CYP11B2 expression and aldosterone synthesis.",

        "abstract": "Introduction There are concerns that the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patients with brain injury may potentially elevate intracranial pressure (ICP). However, the transmission of PEEP into the thoracic cavity depends on the properties of the lungs and the chest wall. When chest wall elastance is high, PEEP can significantly increase pleural pressure. In the present study, we investigate the different effects of PEEP on the pleural pressure and ICP in different respiratory mechanics.Methods and analysis This study is a prospective, single-centre, physiological study in patients with severe brain injury. Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with ventricular drainage will be enrolled. An oesophageal balloon catheter will be inserted to measure oesophageal pressure. Patients will be sedated and paralysed; airway pressure and oesophageal pressure will be measured during end-inspiratory occlusion and end-expiratory occlusion. Elastance of the chest wall, the lungs and the respiratory system will be calculated at PEEP levels of 5, 10 and 15\u2005cm\u2005H2O. We will classify each patient based on the maximal \u0394ICP/\u0394PEEP being above or below the median for the study population. 2 groups will thus be compared.Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and consent forms were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Fujian Provincial Hospital. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.Trial registration number [NCT02670733][1]; pre-results.

        "abstract": "Local misalignment caused by global homography is a common issue in image stitching task. Content-Preserving Warping (CPW) is a typical method to deal with this issue, in which geometric and photometric constraints are imposed to guide the warping process. One of its essential condition however, is colour consistency, and an elusive goal in real world applications. In this paper, we propose a Generalized Content-Preserving Warping (GCPW) method to alleviate this problem. GCPW extends the original CPW by applying a colour model that expresses the colour transformation between images locally, thus meeting the photometric constraint requirements for effective image stitching. We combine the photometric and geometric constraints and jointly estimate the colour transformation and the warped mesh vertexes, simultaneously. We align images locally with an optimal grid mesh generated by our GCPW method. Experiments on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that our new method is robust to colour variations, outperforming other state-of-the-art CPW-based image stitching methods.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method that stitches multiple videos captured with a fixed camera rig. We propose an Extended-MeshFlow motion model for video stitching. Firstly, uniform features are detected and matched at the overlapping region, from which the Exended-MeshFlow model is estimated. The model then warps the adjacent views to the common central view to eliminate the spatial misalignment. The motions located on the feature positions are interpolated to the mesh vertexes by Multilevel B-Spline Approximation(MBA). Collecting the motions on the vertexes form the vertex profiles, which are smoothed for temporal consistency. During the smoothing, only previous frames are required, thus the proposed method can stitch videos in an online mode. Experimental results on various of videos demonstrate that the proposed method can produce comparable stitching results in aspects of spatial alignment and temporal coherence.",

        "title": "Generalized Content-Preserving Warp: Direct Photometric Alignment Beyond Color Consistency.",
        "abstract": "Motion estimation is vital in many computer vision applications. Most existing methods require high quality and large quantity of feature correspondence and may fail for images with few textures. In this paper, a photometric alignment method is proposed to obtain better motion estimation result. Since the adopted photometric constraints are usually limited to the required illumination or color consistency assumption, a new generalized content-preserving warp (GCPW) framework, therefore, is designed to perform photometric alignment beyond color consistency. Similar to conventional content-preserving warp (CPW), GCPW is also a mesh-based framework, but it extends CPW by appending a local color transformation model for every mesh quad, which expresses the color transformation from a source image to a target image within the quad. Motion-related mesh vertexes and color-related mapping parameters are optimized jointly in GCPW to get more robust motion estimation results. Evaluation of tens of videos reveals that the proposed method achieves more accurate motion estimation results. More importantly, it is robust to significant color variation. Besides, this paper explores the performance of GCPW in two popular computer vision applications: image stitching and video stabilization. Experimental results demonstrate GCPW\u2019s effectiveness in dealing with typical challenging scenes for these two applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  In this paper, we propose a unified framework for efficiently completing streetview and indoor 360\u00b0 panoramas due to the lack of bottom areas caused by the occlusion of the acquisition platform. To greatly reduce the severe distortion at the bottom of the panorama, we first reproject it onto the ground perspective plane containing the whole occluded region to be completed. Then, we formulate the image completion problem in an improved graph cuts optimization framework based on the statistics of similar patches by strengthening the boundary constraints. To further eliminate image luminance differences and color deviations and conceal geometrical parallax among the optimally selected patches for completion, we creatively apply a multi-bland image blending algorithm for perfect image mosaicking from the completed patches and the originally reprojected image. Finally, we back-project the completed and blended ground perspective image into the cylindrical-projection panorama followed by a simple feathering to further reduce artifacts in the panorama. Experimental results on some representative non-panoramic images and streetview and indoor panoramas demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method even in some challenging cases.",

        "abstract": "Several approaches to image stitching use different constraints to estimate the motion model between image pairs. These constraints can be roughly divided into two categories: geometric constraints and photometric constraints. In this paper, geometric and photometric constraints are combined to improve the alignment quality, which is based on the observation that these two kinds of constraints are complementary. On the one hand, geometric constraints (e.g., point and line correspondences) are usually spatially biased and are insufficient in some extreme scenes, while photometric constraints are always evenly and densely distributed. On the other hand, photometric constraints are sensitive to displacements and are not suitable for images with large parallaxes, while geometric constraints are usually imposed by feature matching and are more robust to handle parallaxes. The proposed method therefore combines them together in an efficient mesh-based image warping framework. It achieves better alignment quality than methods only with geometric constraints, and can handle larger parallax than photometric-constraint-based method. Experimental results on various images illustrate that the proposed method outperforms representative state-of-the-art image stitching methods reported in the literature.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the surgical experience and clinical outcome between minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty (THA) and conventional THA. METHODS: A total of 30 cases (30 hips) underwent THA through a minimal incision posterolateral surgical approach (MIS group) and another 30 cases received THA through a standard posterolateral approach at the same period (standard group). The age, gender and body mass index between two groups were similar (P > 0.05), and their disease spectrum was similar. They were treated by cementless prosthesis (Smith &Nephew Company). The operation time, blood loss, incision length, functional recovery, and prosthetic position were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in average incision length, amount of bleeding, postoperative drainage and transfusion between two groups (P < 0.05), and the MIS group was superior to the standard group. There were no significant differences in operation time, postoperative imaging evaluation and acetabular angle between two groups (P > 0.05). Functional recovery of MIS group was rapid than standard group at the early stage, but the functions of joint were similar in middle-stage in both groups. Follow-up period after operation, the prosthesis position was good both in MIS and standard groups. There was no complication in MIS group with the exception of skin abrasin in two cases. The advantages of MIS THA are less traumatic blood loss, good cosmetic incision and rapid recovery of function. The MIS THA can only be used by surgeons rich in experience in THA and in hospitals provided with necessary instruments.",

The gFEX is intended to identify patterns of energy associated with the hadronic decays of high momentum Higgs, W u0026 Z bosons, top quarks and exotic particles in real time at the LHC crossing rate. A prototype v1 with one System-on-Chip Xilinx ZYNQ FPGA, and one Vertex-7 FPGA for technology validation has been designed and tested in 2015. With the lessons learned from the prototype v1, a prototype v2 with three UltraScale FPGAs and one ZYNQ FPGA is implemented on an ATCA module. This board will receive coarse-granularity information from the entire ATLAS calorimeter on 276 optical fibers at the speed up to 12.8 Gb/s synchronous to the 40 MHz LHC clock. The test results of the prototype v2 show that the main gFEX functionalities are working well. Currently it is being used as the test platform for trigger algorithm development and integration with other detector systems. Based on the prototype v2 design, a prototype v3 design, the final prototype before production, has been started. This features a ZYNQ UltraScale+ FPGA and more fiber optical links to provide compatibility for the High-Luiminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC).",

The existing tuning methodologies for fractional order PID are not always satisfy the given gain crossover frequency and phase margin simultaneously. To overcome the drawbacks in the existing synthesis of fractional order controller, the synthesis of optimal fractional order PI controller for higher-order process is proposed. According to the specified phase margin, the corresponding upper boundary of gain crossover frequency and stability surface in parameter space are obtained. Sweeping the order parameter over \u03bb\u2208(0,2), the complete set of stabilizing controller which guarantees both pre-specifying phase frequency characteristic can be collected. Whereafter, the optimal fractional order PI controller is applied to the speed governing systems of steam turbine generation units. The numerical simulation and hardware-in-the-loop simulation demonstrate the effectiveness and satisfactory closed-loop performance of obtained fractional order PI controller.",

We demonstrate that the convex hull of ellipsoids can be made invariant for saturating actuators if each ellipsoid with a bounded control of the saturating actuators is invariant.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Natural rubber ( Hevea brasiliensis ) is a high-valued industrial crop in tropical areas. Reasonable fertilization can improve the quality and production of the natural rubber. Hence, there is a great interest in developing an accurate and robust model to detecting the nitrogen content of rubber tree to improve the production. In this study, we propose a new method for detecting the nitrogen content using fractional calculus augmented NIR spectra. Fractional calculus is applied as a tool to extract additional information from the original spectra. Three different mathematical transforms ( R , 1/ R ,  log ( R )) are utilized before the fractional order derivative analysis. After derivative analysis with different orders (0\u20132), the PLS regression method is utilized to develop the estimation models with the wavelengths selected by significant test of correlation coefficient at 0.01 level. The optimal prediction result  R   P  \u00a0=\u00a00.9245 is achieved by reciprocal spectrum with the order 0.6. Results show that fractional calculus with NIR can be utilized to build a more accurate nitrogen estimation model for rubber tree. The result presented here provides us a fast and non-destructive strategy to evaluate the nitrogen condition of rubber tree and provides a direct way to support the field management.",

The design is derived in several constraints: a flat phase constraint, a gain crossover frequency and a phase margin. With the specified phase margin, it can reach the corresponding upper boundary of gain crossover frequency and the stability region. The complete surface of stabilizing controllers is achieved by guaranteeing the open-loop system to fulfil the pre-set phase margin. Afterwards, a stability line on the relative stable surface can then be obtained. For a set of controllers on the stability line, the flat phase constraint is used to make sure the uniqueness of the designed controller.

        "abstract": "Background/aim  Recent epidemiological studies investigating the modifying effect of air temperature in ozone-mortality associations lack consensus as how to adjust for nonlinear temperature effect in addition to including an interaction term.  Methods  We evaluated the influence of temperature confounding control on temperature-stratified ozone-mortality risks in a time-series setting in eight European cities and 86 U.S. cities, respectively. To investigate potential residual confounding, we additionally incorporated next day\u2019s ozone in models with differing temperature control.  Results  Using only a categorical variable for temperature or only controlling nonlinear effect of low temperatures yielded highly significant ozone effects at high temperatures, but also significant residual confounding in both regions. Adjustment for a nonlinear effect of temperature, especially high temperatures, substantially reduced ozone effects at high temperatures and residual confounding. For example, when using a distributed lag nonliner temperature term, risk estimates at low, medium, and high temperatures were 0.23% (95% CI: \u22120.09% to 0.55%), 0.23% (95% CI: \u22120.06% to 0.53%), and 0.36% (95% CI: 0.04% to 0.68%) in European cities, and 0.11% (95% CI: \u22120.31% to 0.54%), 0.17% (95% CI: \u22120.07% to 0.41%), and 0.59% (95% CI: 0.32% to 0.85%) in U.S. cities.  Conclusion  Inadequate control for confounding by air temperature leads to residual confounding and an overestimation of the temperature modifying effect in studies of ozone-related mortality.",

        "abstract": "Background/aim  Epidemiological studies show that changes in air temperature affect mortality and morbidity. So far these changes have been observed mainly on a temporal scale while spatial changes have rarely been considered. We used land-use regression (LUR) models to predict the spatial variability of temperature and relative humidity and to detect urban heat islands in the Augsburg region, Germany.  Methods  We measured temperature and relative humidity at more than 80 sites between December 2012 and October 2017 in the city centre of Augsburg and the two surrounding counties. Seasonal averages were calculated for monitors with at least 14 days of measurements. Discontinuous measurements were adjusted using data from a reference station. We compiled a large set of predictors, which will be offered as potential explanatory variables to separately model the spatial variation of temperature and relative humidity. As geographic predictors we will offer traffic and land use variables, altitude, population, building density and sky view factor. As remote sensing predictors we will offer albedo, normalised difference vegetation index and. K-fold cross-validation will be used to validate our models.  Results  For each season, we could include five rounds of measurements ranging from 29 to 73 available monitors. The seasonal averages of the monitors ranged between 13\u00b0C and 23.2\u00b0C for the summers and between \u22122.4\u00b0C and 7.1\u00b0C for the winters. For the springs they ranged between 5.2\u00b0C and 14\u00b0C, while between 2\u00b0C and 19.3\u00b0C during autumns. The final LUR models are intended to reflect the spatial distribution of temperature and relative humidity in the study area for the different seasons and will be presented at the conference. Air temperature values are expected to increase within the city centre where building density and traffic rates are higher. Instead, values of relative humidity are supposed to decrease with scarce presence of water bodies and vegetation.  Conclusion  We are developing spatial models to predict seasonal mean temperature and relative humidity for a typical city of Southern Germany. On the basis of these models, we aim to investigate potential health effects in subsequent epidemiological analyses as we will apply the final LUR models to the residential addresses of our KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region) participants.",
