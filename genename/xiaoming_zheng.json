The results show that either CuO or Ce02 activity is quite low for CO oxidation. However, when CuO and Ce02 are mixed, the oxidative activity of the catalyst increases significantly, probably owing to the valency status of copper species (Cu2+ and Cu+) on the CeO2 surface, the dispersion and reducibility. XPS surface analysis shows that CuO loading is very important in forming of either Cu2+ or Cu+. Rietveld analysis shows that some CuO, which has smaller ion radius than Ce4+, enters the Ce02 lattice after CuO and CeO2 are mixed. When the CuO loading reaches 5.0%, the size of CuO crystals is a minimum (6.1 nm) and the micro-strain value is a maximum (2.86\u00d710-3), resulting in high surface energy and the best activity for CO oxidation.",

        "abstract": "The activities of CuO supported on Ti0.5Zr0.5O 2 have been examined with a microreactor-GC NO+CO reaction system and the catalysts characterized by BET, TPR, TG-DTA, XRD and NO-TPD. Experimental results show that the CuO/Ti0.5Zr0.5O2 activities increase with increase in CuO loading. To obtain 99% NO conversion, the reaction temperature needed to be 350\u00b0C in air but only 200\u00b0C in H2 atmosphere. TPR analysis shows two peaks (\u03b1 and \u03b2 peaks) at CuO loading of \u226412%, while a third peak (\u03b3 peak) occurs with higher CuO loading at 300\u00b0C. The \u03b1 peak is attributed to highly dispersed CuO, the \u03b2 peak to isolated CuO and the \u03b3 peak to crystal CuO. TG-DTA also shows endothermic peak at low temperature (120\u00b0C) and exothermic peak at high temperature (725\u00b0C), indicating the completion of ZrTiO4 crystallization. From the XRD analysis, it has been found that there is no CuO crystal diffraction peaks at 12% CuO loading, but two CuO crystal diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 35.5\u00b0 and 38.7\u00b0 are present at 18% CuO loading. With increase in CuO loading, the intensity of CuO diffraction peaks is increased. In addition, NO-TPD analysis shows that NO adsorption and desorption by Ti0.5Zr0.5O2 in air are similar to those in H2 atmosphere. In air atmosphere, both CuO/Ti 0.5Zr0.5O2 and Ti0.5Zr 0.5O2 have two adsorption peaks, but the former has lower desorption peak temperature than the latter, suggesting that the activity of NO decomposition by CuO/Ti0.5Zr0.5O2 is higher than that by Ti0.5Zr0.5O2. In H2 atmosphere, the high temperature desorption peak disappears and there only exists one low temperature desorption peak at 150\u00b0C, inferring that the high temperature adsorption site is probably Cu2+ and the low temperature adsorption site is Cu\u00b0.",

It was found that the types of plasma carrier gases exert great effect on the conversion of adsorbed NOx. The conversion of adsorbedNO xis much lower in N2 plasma than in Ar plasma, which is attributed to the reverse reaction,NO xformation reaction. The momentary increase of oxygen species derived from the decomposition of adsorbed NOx is considered to be the main cause as their collisions with nitrogen species can generateNO xagain. Thus, solid carbon was added to the catalyst to act as a scavenger for active oxygen species to improve the conversion of adsorbedNO xin N2 plasma. A NOx removal rate of 97.8% was obtained on 8.5wt.% carbon mixed H-ZSM-5 at an energy efficiency of 0.758 mmol NOx/Wh. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Supported CuO catalysts have been employed to investigate the catalytic combustion of acetonitrile, ethylenediamine and nitromethane. The catalytic activity depends on the nature of support. The difference in activity of supported CuO catalyst is because of the reducibility of CuO over catalyst, as confirmed by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies. When carbon atom in nitrogen-containing compound is oxidized totally to form CO2, N atom is oxidized to form N2, N2O and NO2. N2 selectivity in the case of nitromethane oxidation decreases monotonously with reaction temperature. However, N2 selectivity in the case of acetonitrile and ethylenediamine oxidation goes through a minimum. The possible reason of the minimum in N2 selectivity is that product NO2 and/or NO reacts with the -CN and -NH2 groups of acetonitrile and ethylenediamine molecule, and produces N2 at higher temperature. The N2 selectivity also depends on the nature of nitrogen-containing compound.",

        "abstract": "Bifunctional mesoporous organic-inorganic hybrid silica incorporating both platinum and organosulfonic acid groups were synthesized for use in simultaneously catalyzing the one-step hydrogenation/esterification (OHE) of acetic acid and acetaldehyde, which was considered as a model reaction for the upgrading of biomass-derived bio-oil. The work explored optimizing the synthesis procedure to generate a bifunctional catalyst with enhanced combined activity for the OHE reaction. The presence of Pt was found to enhance the acidic properties of the organosulfonic acid functionalized silica. The mechanism by which the Pt incorporation affected the acid sites was investigated by the using XPS, FT-IR, FT-Raman characterization. The XPS results indicated the presence of electron transfer between the Pt and -SO3H groups. The FT-IR and FT-Raman results, which were in agreement with XPS, demonstrated an electron density increase for S and a S-O bond energy increase, which was proposed to be the reason for the acidity enhancement due to the presence of Pt. Additionally, arenesulfonic acid groups were substituted for propylsulfonic acid groups and the resulting material had higher catalytic activity due to the increased acid strength. An optimal synthesis procedure was demonstrated in which the Pt was first impregnated on the mesoporous silica using reductive deposition. Then Pt was activated and the material further modified by grafting on arenesulfonic acid groups. The resulting catalyst was about four times more active than the original base case bifunctional material. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

Pd/CeO2 exhibits high catalytic activity for the oxidation of CO, showing markedly enhanced catalytic activities due to the combined\n effect of palladium and cerium dioxide. The Pd/CeO2 catalyst is superior to Pd/ZrO2, Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2, Pd/ZSM-5 and Pd/SiO2 catalysts with regard to the activity under the conditions examined.

CeO2 inhibits the hydrogen reduction of PdO. CO-TPR measurements have shown the existence of three peaks. The low-temperature\n peak (\u03b1) is due to the Pd hydroxide species. The \u03b2 peak has been attributed to finely dispersed PdO. The high-temperature\n peak (\u03b3) has been attributed to crystal phase PdO.

        "abstract": "Hydrogenation properties of p -chloronitrobenzene (CNB) have been studied over alumina, zirconium dioxide and titania prepared by different ways supported platinum catalysts in ethanol at 303 K and atmospheric pressure. Pt/TiO 2 catalyst exhibits good catalytic activity and selectivity of p -chloroaniline (CAN). The conversion of p -CNB is over 99% and p -CAN is main product on the hydrogenation of p -CNB over TiO 2 -supported platinum catalysts. PtM/TiO 2 catalysts (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) have also been investigated for the hydrogenation of p -CNB to p -CAN. A significant influence on the catalytic properties is showed with introduction of transition metals to Pt/TiO 2 catalyst. Both catalytic activity and selectivity of p -CAN are all improved. Among all the catalysts, PtFe/TiO 2 catalyst shows the best catalytic activity (TOF, 1.39 s \u22121 ) and the highest yield of p -CAN (98.0 mol%) on the hydrogenation of p -CNB. Keywords Chloronitrobenzene Chloroaniline Hydrogenation 1 Introduction There is a growing interest to develop supported metallic catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of a specific function in polyfunctional organic molecules. To achieve this goal the properties of catalyst can be tuned by modifying the dispersion of the metal particle, by alloying or by initiating some kind of interaction between the metal particle and the carrier. The catalysts can be easily removed from the reaction mixtures and wastes could be largely diminished. Aromatic haloamines are important intermediates in the chemistry of dyes, drugs, herbicides and pesticides. Nitro-submitted aromatic compounds can be effectively reduced to aromatic amines in the presence of various catalysts, including precious metal catalysts. However, where the nitro compound contains an aromatic halogen, reduction of the nitro group without dehalogenation presents a particularly difficult problem [1] . Special catalyst has been proposed as a method of reducing hydrogenolysis of the halogen group [1\u20136] . Among these catalysts, platinum-based catalysts have received much attention for minimizing dehalogenation combined with a fast rate of nitro-group reduction. To improve selectivity, the catalyst preparations are modified (alloying [7] and metal/support interaction [8] , etc.) or specific additives (promoters or inhibitors) [9\u201313] are used in the reaction system. Catalytic hydrogenation reactions are influenced by many factors, which include the presence of catalytic activators or poisons, temperature, pressure, solvent agitation and other conditions specific to the particular process. One of the more important considerations is the catalyst support. Suitable carriers such as carbon, alumina, barium carbonate, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, kieselguhr, silica, titania-supported platinum catalysts have been reported for the hydrogenation of chloronitrobenzene. It has been reported that Pt/TiO 2 catalyst reduced at high temperature is more efficient in preventing dehalogenation. It is proposed [8] that the migration of suboxide TiO x species ( x <2) on to the Pt particles, in a strong metal/support interaction state, is responsible for this behavior. Migrating TiO x adspecies on Pt activate the N\ue605O bond which becomes highly susceptible to hydrogen attack. However, high selectivity of p -chloroaniline accompanies low catalytic activity. In our experiment, we prepared different TiO 2 supports and found good catalytic activity and selectivity for TiO 2 -supported platinum catalyst. The aim of the present work is to determine the influence of support on the hydrogenation of chloronitrobenzene (abbreviated as CNB) over supported Pt catalysts. Substrate concentration, reaction temperature and bimetallic effect are also studied on the hydrogenation of CNB over TiO 2 -supported Pt catalysts in the liquid phase. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of supported platinum catalysts Supported platinum catalysts are prepared by conventional impregnation with an aqueous solution of hexachloroplatinic acid. The loading of platinum is 0.3 wt.%. The sample impregnated is reduced by KBH 4 , filtered and washed with large amount of water, dried at 373 K overnight, and then calcined at 673 K for 4 h. TiO 2 support is prepared by hydrolyzation of TiCl 4 , then calcined at 673 K for 2 and 21 h, the platinum catalyst supported over prepared TiO 2 is abbreviated as Pt/TiO 2 (I) and Pt/TiO 2 (II), respectively. The TiO 2 support of Pt/TiO 2 (III) catalyst is purchased from chemical company. The TiO 2 support of Pt/TiO 2 (IV) catalyst is prepared by sel\u2013gol. The bimetallic PtM/TiO 2 (II) catalysts (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) are also prepared by impregnation, i.e. platinum is impregnated after the transition metal is impregnated on TiO 2 . The preparation process is similar to monometallic Pt catalyst, and the content of M and Pt is 0.04 and 0.3 wt.%, respectively. 2.2 Characterization Surface areas of the supported platinum catalysts were determined by N 2 adsorption at 77 K using the BET method in an OMNISORP 100CX apparatus. The catalysts and crystal sizes of various supports were charactered by XRD (Rigaku-D/max-B automated power X-ray diffractometer, Cu K\u03b1, 45 kV, 40 mA). Dispersion of platinum was measured by H 2 chemisorption, following a procedure described elsewhere [14] . By assuming a stoichiometry for H 2 adsorption on surface platinum atoms (Pt s ) of unity, the dispersion of Pt is given by D = Pt s /Pt t = H/Pt t . The sizes of platinum particles were obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The above results are shown in Table 1 . 2.3 Catalytic reaction Hydrogenations of m -, o - and p -CNB are carried out at 303 K and atmospheric pressure of hydrogen in a thermostated glass reactor closed with silicon rubber cap and connected with hydrogen gas burette. The atmosphere is replaced with hydrogen several times after 0.1 g platinum catalyst is added to the reactor, and then 10 mL of ethanol solution is added. The catalyst is activated under hydrogen with magnetic stirring at 303 K for 1 h before 10 mL ethanol solution of chloronitrobenzene (4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol of substrate) is injected into the reactor. The hydrogenation consumption is monitored with a graduated gas burette. Chemical analysis of the products is performed by gas chromatography Perkin-XL, equipped with an FID detector and SE-30 capillary column. Reactants and products are identified by comparison with authentic samples. Biphenyl is used as internal standard. Several experiments using different amounts of catalyst and different speed of agitation were carried out in order to determine the diffusion control region in order to eliminate mass transfer limitations during our studies. 3 Results and discussion It is known that hydrogenation rates are influenced by many factors in catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Catalytic properties of TiO 2 , \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 -supported platinum catalysts have been examined for the hydrogenation of p -CNB, and the results are listed in Table 2 . From Table 2 , we can see that Pt/TiO 2 (I) catalyst shows the best catalytic property for the hydrogenation of p -CNB under normal pressure and 303 K. The hydrogenation rates increase in the order: Pt/TiO 2 (I)>Pt/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 >Pt/ZrO 2 , and the selectivities of p -CAN improve in the order: Pt/TiO 2 (I)>Pt/ZrO 2 >Pt/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 . We propose that there is part strong metal/support interaction (SMSI) in Pt/TiO 2 (I) catalyst when calcined at high temperature, although the catalyst is not reduced by H 2 at high temperature. Part SMSI is responsible for the good hydrogenation properties of Pt/TiO 2 (I) catalyst. In addition, catalytic activity increases with increasing the amount of catalyst, but the yield of p -CAN decreases. Different reductants have also influence on both catalytic activity and yield of p -CAN. All catalysts reduced by hydrazine hydrate show low catalytic activity and high yield of p -CAN. Pt/ZrO 2 catalyst has no catalytic activity, and Pt/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 and Pt/TiO 2 (I) also show low catalytic activity, however, the yield of p -CAN is improved significantly. The catalyst reduced by KBH 4 exhibits good catalytic activity. In our experiment, we also investigated the effect of K and B. We find that K shows negligible effect. Thus we suggested that good effects are also related to the presence of B [15] . The level of B measured by ICP is 0.027 wt.%. The hydrogenation properties of different preparation of TiO 2 -supported platinum catalysts are also investigated, and the results are listed in Table 3 . From Table 3 , we can see that different preparation of TiO 2 has significant influence on the hydrogenation of p -CNB. Pt/TiO 2 (II) shows the best catalytic activity, the value of TOF is 1.45 s \u22121 . Pt/TiO 2 (I) shows lower catalytic activity and yield of p -CAN. It is interesting that catalytic activity increases significantly when the support is calcined for a longer time (Pt/TiO 2 (II) catalyst). The different catalytic activity is related to phase composition of the support from XRD. Pt/TiO 2 catalyst that has certain extent of rutile and anatase phase shows better catalytic behavior. Similar phenomenon was found on the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over different phase composition of TiO 2 -supported platinum catalyst [16] . Base on above experiment results, we study the influence of substrate concentration and reaction temperature on the hydrogenation of p -CNB over Pt/TiO 2 (II) catalyst in particular. The results are listed in Tables 4 and 5 . In our experiment, we also find that the yield of p -CAN increases with increasing the concentration of substrate on the hydrogenation of p -CNB. High concentration of substrate probably prevents products from contacting with active sites, which partly inhibits hydrogenolysis of C\ue5f8Cl bond [17] . From Table 4 , we can see that the reaction rate strongly depends on substrate concentration. Under constant hydrogen pressure, reaction temperature and catalyst concentration, the reaction rate equation may be expressed as follows: (1) R=kC n where R , k, C and n are the reaction rate, rate constant, concentration of p -CNB and reaction order, respectively. A plot of log R versus log C results in a straight line, and the reaction order \u201c n \u201d is 0.55. Hydrogenation rate often increases with increasing reaction temperature. In our experiment, we also obtain similar results, but the yield of p -CAN decreases (see Table 5 ). The main reason is that hydrogenolysis rate of the C\ue5f8Cl bond increases with increasing reaction temperature. The partial hydrogen pressure in the reaction flask at 40 \u00b0C will decrease for the evaporation of solvent and a lower hydrogenation rate is observed. At a higher than 40 \u00b0C temperature, high catalytic activity resumed but selectivity of p -CAN decreases sharply. The activation energy was determined for Pt/TiO 2 (II) catalyst. The value found, i.e. 11 \u00b1 2 kJ mol \u22121 , is lower than those reported by Coq et al. [17] for the hydrogenation of p -CNB over Pt/Al 2 O 3 (25 \u00b1 2 kJ mol \u22121 ), or by Moreau et al. [18] , who found a value of 27 kJ mol \u22121 for CNB hydrogenation over sulfide catalysts. The stability of Pt/TiO 2 (II) catalyst was also investigated, and the results are summarized in Table 6 . In the recycling experiment, five recycles were carried out for the hydrogenation of p -CNB. It is found that the catalytic activity decrease very slightly, but the yield of p -CAN increases. Ninety eight mole percentage of yield of p -CAN is obtained when catalyst is used for four recycles. Lower catalytic activity is influenced by many factors on the hydrogenation of p -CNB. For example, a part of Pt could be lost when the catalyst is reused (the level of Pt measured by ICP still is 0.28 wt.%), and results in decreasing in the number of active sites for hydrogen of the Pt surface. Some intermediates could be also adsorbed on the surface of catalyst and partly cover active center, and which decrease catalytic activity. After Pt/TiO 2 (II) catalyst is used for five recycles, the catalyst is reduced by KBH 4 again, filtered and washed with large amount of water, and then dried at 373 K. We find that catalytic activity is partly resumed. The result shows that loss part of B is also a reason of lower catalytic activity. Transition metal complexes have been studied widely as catalysts for the hydrogenation of organic compounds. They have also been used as co-catalyst in a large variety of chemical reactions. The addition of the transition metal ions and metal complexes to the noble metal catalysts can considerably modulate both the activity and the selectivity of the catalysts. Table 7 lists the results of hydrogenation of p -CNB catalyzed by Pt/TiO 2 (I) catalysts modified by transition metals. From Table 7 , we can see that the additions of small amount of transition metals to Pt/TiO 2 (I) catalyst improve obviously catalytic activity and yield of p -CNB to p -CAN. PtFe/TiO 2 (I) catalyst exhibits the best hydrogenation rate (the value of TOF is 1.39 s \u22121 ) and the highest yield of p -CAN (98.0 mol%). The effect of transition metal on hydrogenation properties of supported Pt catalyst may be usually interpreted by electronic effect and/or geometric effect. As reported by literature, catalytic activity is enhanced at low M/Pt ratio for most of the bimetallic catalysts, i.e. good hydrogenation properties are obtained on large Pt particles. Such behavior was also reported by Galvagno et al. [19] for nitrobenzene hydrogenation over PtSn/nylon catalysts and Coq [17] for p -CNB hydrogenation over Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. It was explained in part by a redispersion of the Pt particles. This interpretation cannot be applied in the present work for Pt particles in Pt/TiO 2 (I) and PtFe/TiO 2 (I) catalysts had a mean particle size of 1.7\u20132.0 nm (see Table 7 ). We prefer the second interpretation proposed by Galvagno et al. [19] , suggesting that the tin species on the N\ue5f8O bond, which becomes more reactive towards the attack by chemisorbed hydrogen. PtFe/TiO 2 catalyst shows better hydrogenation properties than that of catalysts. Ionic and electron deficient species act as Lewis sites. These sites interact with the lone electron pair of the oxygen atom of the N\ue605O group, polarizing the bond, and favoring its hydrogenation by hydridic hydrogen adsorbed on the Pt metal. It is well known that copper metal catalysts usually show better catalytic properties on the selective hydrogenation of various organic compounds. However, copper metal catalysts are easily poisoned by sulfide and chloride. In our experiment, PtCu/TiO 2 catalyst shows low catalytic activity, which may be related to the chlorine from the hydrogenolysis of the C\ue5f8Cl bond and/or from hexachloroplatinic acid. The presence of B is also responsible for its lower catalytic activity. Similar phenomenon was reported on the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over cobalt\u2013copper catalyst reduced by NaBH 4 [20] . 4 Conclusions TiO 2 , \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 -supported platinum catalysts can catalyze the hydrogenation of p -CNB to p -CAN at 303 K and normal pressure. TiO 2 -supported platinum catalysts show good hydrogenation properties. Different preparation of TiO 2 -supported platinum catalyst shows different hydrogenation properties. Pt/TiO 2 (II) catalyst shows the best catalytic activity (TOF is 1.45 s \u22121 ) and good yield of p -CAN, and also has good stability. The yield of p -CAN increases with increasing the concentration of substrate on the hydrogenation of p -CNB over Pt/TiO 2 (II) catalyst. Both catalytic activities and yields of p -CAN are all improved over Pt/TiO 2 (I) catalyst with the introductions of transition metals(M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) on the hydrogenation of p -CNB. The effect of transition metal may be interpreted by electronic effect. Electron deficient species of the second element promote the turnover frequency of Pt atoms by activating the nitrogen\ue5f8oxygen bond. Addition of Fe improves the yield of p -CAN from 92.8 to 98.0 mol% at high p -CNB conversion. References [1] R. Baltzly A.P. Phillips J. Am. Chem. Soc. 68 1946 261 [2] A.A. Strel\u2019tsova, N.D.

        "abstract": "A novel palladium supported on cerium, lanthanum, praseodymium and zirconium-pillared montmorillonite (MMT) catalysts are prepared and for the catalytic combustion of toluene, acetone and ethyl acetate. The order of catalytic activity is consistent with the different support: La\u2013Zr/MMT \u2248 Ce\u2013Zr/MMT > Pr\u2013Zr/MMT. X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment revealed that the basal spacing of MMT enhanced from 0.97\u00a0nm to 1.73\u00a0nm after Zr-pillared treatment. After doping of Ce, La and Pr, the interlayer spacing increased to 1.94, 2.02 and 1.85\u00a0nm on Ce\u2013Zr/MMT, La\u2013Zr/MMT and Pr\u2013Zr/MMT support. N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) helped to understand the catalytic performance of these palladium supported and rare earth oxides doped MMT catalysts. Keywords Zirconium pillared montmorillonite Rare earth oxides Volatile organic compounds purification 1 Introduction Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are considered as significant pollutants due to their toxicity and malodorous to human being, even in their smog formation. Catalytic combustion is regarded as an attractive way for purification VOCs emissions. The function of the catalysts can convert the polluting compounds into relatively harmless compounds at low operating temperatures. Among them, such as Pt, Pd supported on \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 was the most active catalysts. Currently, MMT clay is considered to be a most probable material in various catalysis reactions as catalyst support. Appeared as a new family of clays, a number of different cations, such as aluminium [1] , titanium [2] , and zirconium [3] polycations have been used for the preparation of pillared MMT. Recently, the rare earth oxides is verified effective in the total oxidation catalysts [4,5] . However, little work has been carried out on use MMT as catalyst support, in the oxidation of VOCs, by doping rare earth oxides into zirconium-pillared MMT. The objective of the present work is to preparation a new material of rare earth oxides doped and Zr-pillared MMT and then use it supported palladium as efficient catalysts for catalytic oxidation of toluene, acetone and ethyl acetate. The support effect and microstructure was studied. 2 Experimental MMT (Mongolia, ion exchange capacity of 108.4\u00a0mmol/100\u00a0g) was used as the starting material. Zr/MMT was obtained by successive ion exchanges with a given content of ZrOCl 2 \u00b78H 2 O (0.1\u00a0M), which was added dropwise to the 0.1\u00a0wt.% MMT solution while successively stirred at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h. Then, thus obtained material was kept at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h. Afterwards, a 1.2\u00a0M Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \"6H 2 O, (La(NO 3 ) 3 \"6H 2 O and Pr (NO 3 ) 3 \"6H 2 O aqueous solution was added drop to Zr/MMT at a certain rate by stirring continuously at 80\u00a0\u00b0C. The mol ratio of rare earth oxides with zirconium was 1:8. Finally, all samples were washed many times with distilled water to remove the Cl - completely and then dried at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h in air and calcined at 500\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h; the obtained samples were named as Ce/Zr-MMT, La/Zr-MMT and Pr/Zr-MMT, respectively. The supported PdO on Ce/Zr-MMT, La/Zr-MMT and Pr/Zr-MMT were prepared by the conventional wet impregnation method. The catalysts of 0.1\u00a0wt.% PdO supported on Ce/Zr-MMT, La/Zr-MMT and Pr/Zr-MMT are denoted as PdO/CZM, PdO/LZM, and PdO/PZM, respectively. The catalytic activity test was measured using a fixed bed flow type reacter (0.6\u00a0cm i.d.). A reaction mixture consisted of air/toluene (acetone or ethyl acetate) was introduced to the catalyst at a flow rate of 10,000\u00a0h \u2212 1 . Analysis of the products was carried out on a line gas chromatography (GC-8A, Japan) with a FID attachment. The activity of the catalyst was characterized by temperatures at which VOCs conversion reaches 98%, as expressed by T 98 , respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-IIIB diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation. BET specific surface areas and the pore size of the samples were tested on OMNISORP\u00b7100 CX instrument. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to examine the morphology of the samples. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic activity tests Fig. 1 shows the catalytic activity of PdO/CZM, PdO/LZM, and PdO/PZM for toluene, acetone and ethyl acetate oxidation. Firstly, the tested catalytic activity of raw MMT clay is quite low; the T 98 of raw MMT for toluene, acetone and ethyl acetate is at 520, 500 and 560\u00a0\u00b0C; and the T 98 of Zr/MMT is respectively at 420, 380 and 430\u00a0\u00b0C (not shown in Fig. 1 ), indicating the activity of Zr/MMT is higher than that of raw MMT. It can be seen that the conversion of toluene oxidation reaches 98% at 210\u00a0\u00b0C lower temperature on PdO/LZM sample. At this temperature, toluene conversion for PdO/CZM catalyst is about 90%, and is about 75% for PdO/PZM catalyst. The catalytic activity of the three catalysts for acetone was in this sequence: PdO/LZM \u2248 PdO/CZM > PdO/PZM. And for ethyl acetate oxidation, PdO/LZM also exhibits higher activities in comparison with PdO/CZM and PdO/PZM. This fact denotes that PdO supported on La/Zr-MMT is more active for the total oxidation of the three VOCs substances than that supported on Ce/Zr-MMT and Pr/Zr-MMT. 3.2 XRD characterizations Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of samples obtained by Zr/MMT with and without doping of cerium, lanthanum, and praseodymium oxides. The interlayer spacing in the sample of MMT clay increases from 0.97 to 1.73\u00a0nm after Zr-pillared treatment, corresponding to the d (001) plane peak increase ( Fig. 2 A). This proves that the bigger Zr 4+ ion must be located in the interlayer space of MMT layer and cause partial structural changes. Furthermore, the interlayer spacing of Zr/MMT increases from 1.73\u00a0nm to 1.94, 2.02 and 1.85\u00a0nm after doped cerium, lanthanum, and praseodymium oxides into Zr-pillared MMT. Concerning Pr, Ce, and La-doped Zr/MMT samples ( Fig. 2 B\u2013D), the d (001) reflection for basal spacing was much wider and the intensity was higher in those samples than on Zr/MMT ( Fig. 2 A), which indicates praseodymium, cerium and lanthanum oxides are still present in the Zr-pillared MMT and remodel the order of the layered structure. 3.3 Specific surface area and N 2 adsorption results The BET surface area of Zr/MMT is 102.8\u00a0m 2 /g, higher than raw MMT clay of 45.70\u00a0m 2 /g. In addition, the surface areas of La\u2013Zr/MMT, Ce\u2013Zr/MMT and Pr\u2013Zr/MMT appeared as 295.8, 255.2 and 126.0\u00a0m 2 /g, indicating the doped materials exhibited much higher surface areas. The N 2 sorption isotherms of raw MMT clay, Pr\u2013Zr/MMT, Ce\u2013Zr/MMT and La\u2013Zr/MMT were illustrates in Fig. 3 . It is interesting to note that the pore volume was higher in these cerium, lanthanum, praseodymium doped and zirconium-pillared samples than that of raw MMT sample, the total pore volume is 2 \u2013 3.5 times higher than raw MMT clay, respectively. The adsorbed volume sequence is: La\u2013Zr/MMT > Ce\u2013Zr/MMT > Pr\u2013Zr/MMT > MMT. Thus, a good correlation between the surface area and pore volume with the catalytic activity can be found. The good oxidation activity of PdO supported La\u2013Zr/MMT catalyst might due to La\u2013Zr/MMT support in which appears maximum surface area and adsorbed volume among the three supports. 3.4 SEM analysis As can be seen in Fig. 4 , raw MMT clay appears a mass of flake shape ( Fig. 4 A). An obvious variation suggests some mass of flake decreased in Zr/MMT and many leaf-like layers were appeared and the interlayer was changed after Zr-pillared. It seems that Zr-pillared treatment caused a structural change in raw MMT, leading to some exfoliated sheets as showed in Fig. 4 B. After doping of lanthanum into Zr/MMT, the morphology changed remarkably, as displayed in Fig. 4 C, the cell of mass in Zr/MMT appeared agglomeration. This morphology change indicated that some La 3+ ions would enter the interlayer space of Zr/MMT and appear an interaction with them. 4 Conclusions Series catalysts of palladium supported on Ce\u2013Zr/MMT, La\u2013Zr/MMT and Pr\u2013Zr/MMT were prepared, their morphologies properties and catalytic activity was studied. New materials of Ce\u2013Zr/MMT, La\u2013Zr/MMT and Pr\u2013Zr/MMT used as catalyst support, might be necessary in VOCs oxidative applications.

LBF is a very complex mixture, and the three groups in LBF: acids, aldehydes and phenols, are primarily responsible for deterioration in the quality. The upgrading reactions were carried out over Pt/Al(2)(SiO(3))(3), Pt/C or Pt/MgO in supercritical methanol. It is demonstrated that supercritical condition can greatly facilitate the esterification process, and after 6 h reaction, all the acids can be converted into esters even without adding any catalyst.

        "abstract": "The decomposition of CO 2 in a dielectric packed-bed plasma reactor has been studied. It was found that the dielectric properties and morphology of packing dielectric pellets play important roles in the reaction due to their influence on the electron energy distribution in the plasma. The acid-base properties of the packing materials also affect the reaction through the chemisorption of CO 2 on basic sites of the materials. Heterogeneous reactions on the solid surfaces of the dielectric materials also play a role in the reaction, which was also confirmed through the investigation of the influence of the discharge length on the reaction. The reverse reaction of CO 2 decomposition, the oxidation of CO, was also investigated to further understand the role of dielectric materials in the plasma and their effect on plasma reactions. Both the decomposition of CO 2 and the oxidation of CO in nonpacked or dielectric packed reactors are first-ordered. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",

        "abstract": "CO 2 reforming of propane was studied in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma and in the association of plasma with Ni/\u03b3-Al 2O 3 catalyst. The main products of the reaction in DBD plasma were hydrogen, CO, and a large amount of hydrocarbons, indicating the reforming reaction could occur in DBD plasma without catalysts. C-C coupling and cracking reactions also played important roles. The presence of propane and CO 2 promoted the conversion of each other through the attachment of a series of radicals generated by the plasma. When the reaction was performed in association of plasma with Ni/\u03b3-Al 2O 3 catalyst, the activation temperature of the catalyst was reduced and the synergistic function between plasma and the catalyst was obtained. Vibrationally excited molecules and radicals produced by the plasma enhanced reactant conversions in the association reaction mode. The inhibition of methanation reaction in the association mode was due to the further reaction of excited methane with CO 2 to produce H 2 and CO. The synergistic function between the plasma and the catalyst improved the selectivity of preferable H 2 and CO in the association mode.

The relationship between the area of metallic copper and the activity of methanol synthesis has also been investigated. The catalytic activity over Cu-Ti/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation is higher than that of Cu/\u03b3-Al2O3. The adding of titanium is beneficial in enhancing the dispersion of the supported copper oxide and make the reduction behavior of Cu-Ti/\u03b3Al2O3 catalyst different from the individual supported copper oxide calalysts. For the CuO/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst there are two reducible copper oxide species: \u03b1 and \u03b2 peaks are attributed to the reduction of highly dispersed copper oxide species and bulk CuO species respectively. For the Cu-Ti/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst, four reduction peaks are observed. Two TPR peaks with lower temperatures (namely \u03b11 and \u03b12) have been attributed to the hydrogen uptake of nested oxygen ions and temptable oxygen ions, respectively. \u03b21 and \u03b22 peaks are attributed to the reduction of bulk CuO with different particle size of copper. XPS results reveal that there exists strong interaction between the copper oxide and titania which makes the binding energy of Cu(2P3/2) shift to higher value.",

The results of pulse surface reactions showed that Ni/SiO 2 catalysts containing Gd 2 O 3 promoter could increase the activity for CH 4 decomposition, and Raman analysis confirmed that reactive carbon species mainly formed on the Ni/SiO 2 catalysts containing Gd 2 O 3 promoter. In this work, it was found that methane activation and reforming reactions proceeded according to different mechanisms after Gd 2 O 3 addition due to the formation of carbonate species. In addition, Ni/SiO 2 catalysts containing Gd 2 O 3 promoter demonstrated higher activity and stability in both CRM and MATR reactions in a fluidized bed reactor than Ni/SiO 2 catalysts without Gd 2 O 3 even at a higher space velocity.

        "abstract": "Pt-Co/Al2O3 catalyst has been studied for CO2 reforming of CH4 to synthesis gas. It was found that the catalytic performance of the catalyst was sensitive to calcination temperature. When Co/Al2O3 was calcined at 1473 K prior to adding a small amount of Pt to it, the resulting bimetallic catalyst showed high activity, optimal stability and excellent resistance to carbon deposition, which was more effective to the reaction than Co/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. At lower metal loading, catalyst activity decreased in the following order: Pt-Co/ Al2O3 < Pt/Al2O3 \u226b Co/Al2O3. With 9% Co, the Co/Al2O3 calcined at 923 K was also active for CO2 reforming of CH4, however, its carbon formation was much more fast than that of the Pt-Co/Al2O3 catalyst. The XRD results indicated that Pt species well dispersed over the bimetallic catalyst. Its high dispersion was related to the presence of CoAl2O4, formed during calcining of Co/Al2O3 at high temperature before Pt addition. Promoted by Pt, CoAl2O4 in the catalyst could be reduced partially even at 923 K, the temperature of pre-reduction for the reaction, confirmed by TPR. Based on these results, it was considered that the zerovalent platinum with high dispersion over the catalyst surface and the zerovalent cobalt resulting from CoAl2O4 reduction are responsible for high activity of the Pt-Co/Al2O3 catalyst, and the remain CoAl2O4 is beneficial to suppression of carbon deposition over the catalyst.",

        "abstract": "A large number of Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 nanorods have been synthesized by using nonionic triblock copolymer P123 as structure directing agents. The nanorods have average diameters of 10 \u00b1 1 nm and lengths of 50 \u00b1 5 nm, which has been characterized by N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption, XRD, EDX and TEM. The nanorods should provide promising materials for lean-burn NO x reduction. Keywords Template Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 Nanomaterials Characterisation methods 1 Instruction Mesoporous binary and mixed metal oxides are particularly promising as heterogeneous catalysts because of their tunable surface compositions, metal oxidation states (via organic\u2013inorganic interfacial chemistry), and wall structures \u2014 amorphous or nanocrystalline. Furthermore, their electronic properties and the surface structure, which are critical parameters for the catalytic performance of any catalyst, are expected to change greatly in the nano regime [1] , thereby offering new, exciting possibilities for the molecular engineering of binary and mixed metal oxides with unique catalytic, optical, and electrical properties. During the past decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of binary and mixed oxides with 1D nanostructures (nanowires, nanotubes, or nanorods) such as TiO 2 [2] , In 2 O 3 [3] , ZnO [4] , Al 2 O 3 [5] , Eu 2 O 3 [6] , Ga 2 O 3 [7] , PbO 2 and Pb 3 O 4 [8] , WO 3 [9] , CuO [10] , MnO 2 [11] , MgO [12] , SiO 2 [13] , GeO 2 [14] , Ga 2 O 3 \u2013ZnO [15] . In recent years, Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 has attracted much attention because the catalysts showed relatively high activity for lean-burn NO x reduction [16\u201323] . Generally, Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 can be prepared by impregnation [16\u201319] , Sol\u2013gel [20\u201323] and coprecipitation [23] . Nonetheless, the non-uniform pore size, relatively small surface (BET surface area below 200 m 2 /g) may limit its potential application for the reaction. Therefore, significant researches are still needed in further synthesizing, understanding and predicting the size and shape of the nanostructure from a specific synthesis condition. Although several papers has been published in synthesis of ordered mesoporous alumina and alumina nanostructure with template as structure directing agents [24,25] , to the best of our knowledge, no studies that describe the preparation of gallium oxide\u2013alumina composite oxide with 1D nanostructure have been reported. In this paper, we report a convenient and controllable approach for the synthesis of Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 nanorods with high BET surface area. Nonionic triblock copolymer EO 20 PO 70 EO 20 (designated Pluronic P123; Aldrich) was used as a structure-directing agent. Aluminum tri-isopropoxide (AIP) and gallium nitrate were used as aluminium and gallium source, respectively. 2 Experimental In a typical synthesis, 10.2 g AIP and a small amount of concentration nitric acid was added into 80 ml hot distilled water (90 \u00b0C) with vigorously stirring to produce aluminum boehmite sol. At the same time, 2.4 g P123 was dissolved in 60 ml distilled water with vigorously stirring at room temperature (RT). After P123 was dissolved completely, the solution and calculated gallium nitrate (containing 0.8 g Ga 2 O 3 ) was added to aluminum boehmite sol and the reaction mixture was stirred at 90 \u00b0C for 6 h. Ammonium hydroxide was slowly added into the reaction mixture under gently stirring conditions to achieve the pH value near 8.5, and the white sol was aged for 24 h under RT. Subsequently, the products were filtered, washed with large amounts of deionized water to remove the NH 4 NO 3 byproduct and dried at 110 \u00b0C for 24 h. Finally, the samples were calcined at 600 \u00b0C in air for 6 h. XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max 2550PC diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation, operating at 40 kV and 300 mA. Nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption experiments were carried out at \u2212 196 \u00b0C on an Omnisorp Coulter 100CX (USA). The pore size distributions were calculated using Barret\u2013Joyner\u2013Hallender (BJH) method on the desorption branch. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum of Ga 2 O 3 samples were obtained on a SIRION scanning electron microscope (FEI, Netherlands) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopic images were obtained on a JEM-1200EX microscope (JEOL, Japan). 3 Results and discussion Small angle powder XRD patterns of reaction products are shown in Fig. 1 A . The presence of a single diffraction peak in 2 \u03b8 region blow 2\u00b0 for both as-made and calcined products is indicative of a mesostructure. After calcination in air at 600 \u00b0C for 5 h, the diffraction peak shifts slightly to 2 \u03b8 larger values (from 2 \u03b8 = 0.91\u00b0 to 1.20\u00b0). The change is accord with the reports on SBA-15 [26] , ZrO 2 and TiO 2 [27] , and Nb 2 O 5 [28] . In the wide-angle region of the XRD patterns ( Fig. 1 B), the diffraction peaks of as-made Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 are in accord with boehmite (JCPDS Card 21-1307). As can be seen by comparing Fig. 1 B, the calcined Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 sample show broad, small-angle reflections consistent with \u03b3-alumina (JCPDS Card No. 50-0741, a = 7.9103\u00c5). To further confirm the phase composition of the calcined product, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were recorded in Fig. 2 . The result exhibits the presence of O, Al and Ga, which indicates the surfactants were removed completely. Further quantitative analysis shows that the phase composition of all areas is near to an approximate atomic ratio of 1 : 0.61 : 0.08. On the basis of XRD and EDX analysis results, we concluded that the calcined product is a nearly pure Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 . N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution (PSD) for Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 nanorods are provided in Fig. 3 . A typical, type IV adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms with a clearly H 1 hysteresis loop is observed. The step-like uptake of N 2 in the range 0.75\u20130.90 P / P 0 corresponds to capillary condensation within framework pores with a BJH diameter of 159.4\u00c5. Besides the well-defined mesoporous, interparticle (textural) porosity is also detected, as evidenced by the adsorption step at high relative pressures of > 0.9 [29] . Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 nanorods show a narrower pore size distribution than that of Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 prepared with sol\u2013gel method [21] . The morphology of Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 nanorods was further measured with TEM. From bright/dark TEM images, the nanorods with average diameter of 10 \u00b1 1 nm and average length of 50 \u00b1 5 nm is observed, as shown in Fig. 4 . The diameter of nanorods, in good agreement with XRD data ( d = 84.1 \u00c5), is smaller than the average pore diameter calculated from N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption measurement. The difference may be attributed to isopropoxide, generated from AIP hydrolysis, which may function in part as a cosurfactant or more likely, that the rapid hydrolysis rate of the AIP limits the lath size of the boehmite precursor, creating a scaffold structure with greater mesostructured space between the randomly intergrown particles. In conclusion, we have developed a new route for the synthesis of Ga 2 O 3 \u2013Al 2 O 3 nanorods, and the reaction products has been characterized by N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption, XRD, EDX, and TEM. The nanorods with diameters of 10 \u00b1 1 nm and lengths of 50 \u00b1 5 nm should provide promising materials for lean-burn NO x reduction.

The nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm and pore-size distribution curve of TiO 2 represented type IV of the BDDT system and a typical mesoporous sample, respectively. After ZrO 2 addition, the diffraction peak of ZrO 2 was not detected and the diffraction peak intensity of CuO did not increase either, likely due to the strong interaction between CuO and ZrO 2 that enhanced the catalytic activity and stability. In the H 2 atmosphere, CuO produced dispersed Cu 0 species. Four desorption species (NO, N 2 O, N 2 and O 2 ) were detected during the thermal desorption of NO by CuO/TiO 2 and CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 treated in both air and H 2 . Addition of ZrO 2 onto CuO/TiO 2 shifted the NO dissociation peaks towards low temperature, indicating that the activity of NO decomposition was higher by CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 than by CuO/TiO 2 . The NO+CO reaction formed intermediary product N 2 O at low temperature but formed N 2 at high temperature. In addition, the peak temperature of NO desorption was related to the catalytic activity under both air and H 2 , and the dissociation of NO on catalysts surface was a rate - determining step in NO+CO reaction. Keywords CuO/TiO 2 catalysts ZrO 2 NO+CO reaction NO-TPD 1 Introduction Nitric oxide (NO x ) is the major toxic pollutant in urban atmosphere, and catalytic reduction of NO with CO is one of the most important reactions for NO x controlling. At present, noble metal catalysts are mainly used for DeNO x . Due to high prices and scarcity of noble metals, it is necessary to find an alternative catalytic component to reduce using or even replace the noble metal. Therefore, studies of non-noble metal catalysts have attracted much attention for the last 10 years. TiO 2 is good at resisting water and trace SO 2 along with high N 2 selectivity in the course of DeNO x . By comparison, ZrO 2 has better thermal stability, unique surface acidity and alkalescence and redox properties. Meanwhile, ZrO 2 is a semiconductor, which means it can easily produce cavity and has strong interaction with active component. So it is possible to improve the performance of catalysts by changing the composition of carrier. However, there have been few studies of the Ti\u2013Zr complex oxide supported CuO for NO + CO reaction. In 1989, Iwamoto et al. [1,2] found that Cu-ZSM5 catalyst had much higher catalytic activity for NO dissociation. From then on, catalytic reduction of NO has been extensively studied, and variety of transition and noble metal catalysts were prepared [3,4] . Recently, the use of TiO 2 as catalyst\u2019s carrier has attracted much attention and TiO 2 -based catalysts are widely applied in NO reduction [5\u20138] . The TiO 2 -based catalysts overcome the shortcoming of TiO 2 and SO x interaction that produces sulphate and causes structural collapse of the carrier, particle gathering of active components and reduction of active surfaces. As a result, the catalytic reduction of NO can be achieved in a sulphur-containing atmosphere, and obtain an excellent NO conversion and N 2 selectivity. Various physicochemical methods are also used to investigate the state of copper ion in CuO/TiO 2 catalysts, and inconsistent results have been reported. Komova et al. [7] found that TiO 2 -supported CuO could exist as Cu 2+ ions, bulk CuO, chain stabilized Cu 2+ ions, and two different oxide clusters with a structure similar to CuO. In contrast, Xu et al. [8] reported two Cu 2+ ions with significantly different reducibility on the anatase surface\u2014CuO phase and highly dispersed Cu 2+ , similar to CuO/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 . Larsson and co-workers [9,10] suggested that low temperature peak in Cu3\u2013Ti of the H 2 -temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles was monomeric copper containing Cu + , and that in Cu12\u2013Ti was polymeric copper containing Cu 2+ . They also found that catalysts using TiO 2 as carrier displayed a high catalysis in CO oxidation, and that CuO catalyst had much higher activity than MoO x , FeO x and CoO x catalysts and its activity at low temperature was even superior to Pt/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. In this study, CuO/TiO 2 and CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 catalysts with different amount of CuO loadings were prepared by impregnating the TiO 2 carrier, and these catalysts in the NO + CO reaction were examined by means of BET, TG-DTA, XRD and NO-temperature programmed desorption (TPD). 2 Experimental 2.1 TiO 2 preparation TiO 2 was prepared by sol\u2013gel method from TiCl 4 with ammonia solution as precipitating agent and ethanol as dispersing agent. A 25 ml TiCl 4 was dissolved in 20 ml distilled water in an ice-water bath. The titanium solution was then slowly mixed with 30 ml distilled water and 20 ml ethanol, and ammonia was added dropwise until pH=9. During the ammonic addition, an intensive precipitation occurred. After the solvent was evaporated at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h, the precipitates were dried at 300 \u00b0C for 2 h to remove NH 4 Cl, and then calcined in an air stream of 450 \u00b0C for 4 h. 2.2 Catalyst preparation The CuO/TiO 2 and CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method using Cu(NO 3 ) 2 and Zr(NO 3 ) 4 aqueous solutions of desired concentrations. After these catalysts being rested for 24 h, catalysts were dried at 120 \u00b0C for 2 h, followed the catalysts were put into a muffle furnace by calcinations in an air stream of 500 \u00b0C for 2 h ( \u03b2 =15 K min \u22121 ). They were denoted as w % CuO/TiO 2 and w % CuO\u2013 w \u2032% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 , where w and w \u2032 are the amount of CuO and ZrO 2 loading, respectively. 2.3 Measurements of catalytic characters The BET surface area of catalysts was determined by N 2 adsorption at 77 K using a Coulter OMNISORP-100 instrument. The TG-DTA experiment was carried out using PE-TGA7 thermo-gravimetric analyzer and DTA/9050311 high temperature differential thermal analyzer. Ten mg of fresh catalysts were taken and measured in air atmosphere, and then treated in 150 ml min \u22121 of dry pure N 2 . The TG-DTA spectra were obtained with temperatures ramped at a linear heating rate of 20 \u00b0C min \u22121 from 50 to 800 \u00b0C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained at 25 \u00b0C using a horizontal Rigaku B/Max lllB powder diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation and a power of 40 mA \u00d730 mA. To measure the NO-TPD, 250 mg of fresh catalysts were loaded onto a quartz reactor ( \u03a6 =5 mm) and reduced in H 2 atmosphere at 500 \u00b0C for 1 h, and followed by two treatments. In treatment 1, catalysts were heated in He at 600 \u00b0C for 1 h, and then cooled to 40 \u00b0C in a flow of He and exposed to a 10% NO\u2013He mixture gas. Excessive NO was removed, and the catalysts were kept in He flow until no significant amount of adsorbates could be detected. The catalysts were then ramped at 600 \u00b0C at a linear heating rate of 20 \u00b0C min \u22121 in He flow. The effluent gases were analysed with a mass spectrometer. In treatment 2, after the catalysts were heated in He at 500 \u00b0C for 1 h, the procedures followed were the same as those in treatment 1. 2.4 Measurements of catalytic activity in NO + CO reaction Catalytic activity was determined under the steady state in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (6 mm). The particle size of catalysts was 20\u201340 mesh, and 120 mg of the catalysts were used. The reaction gas (i.e. feed stream) consisted of a fixed composition of 6.0% NO, 6.0% CO and 88% He (v/v) as a dilute. The catalysts were treated using either H 2 or air at 500 \u00b0C for 1 h. After cooled to room temperature, they were allowed to react with the mixed gas. The reactions were operated at different temperatures with a space velocity of 5000 h \u22121 . Two columns and thermal conduction detectors were used for analyzing the catalytic activity. Column A was packed with 13\u00d7 molecular sieve for separating N 2 , NO and CO, and Column B was packed with Paropak Q for separating N 2 O and CO 2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Textural and structural properties of TiO 2 Fig. 1 shows the nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm and pore-size distribution curve of TiO 2 . The TiO 2 was prepared from TiCl 4 with a N 2 isotherm corresponding to type IV of the BDDT system and was typical of a mesoporous sample. The specific surface area and total pore volume of TiO 2 were 64.5 m 2 /g and 0.441 ml/g, and average pore diameter and stochastic pore diameter were 27.3 nm and about 10 nm, respectively. The DTA curves of TiO 2 showed an absorption heat peak at around 120 \u00b0C, where a weight-lose occurred in its TG curve ( Fig. 2 ). This peak could be due to the evaporation and removal of adsorbed H 2 O and organic substance. Corresponding to an obvious weight-lose step of TiO 2 around 320 \u00b0C, an absorption heat peak was also observed as a result of NH 4 Cl decomposition. 3.2 Activities of CuO/TiO 2 in NO+CO reaction As shown in Fig. 3 , the activities of CuO/TiO 2 in NO + CO reaction increased with the increase in reaction temperature, ranging from low temperatures around 150 \u00b0C to high temperatures above 300 \u00b0C. The catalysts calcined at 500 \u00b0C had very low activity at a CuO loading of 1\u20133%. The NO conversion temperature ( T 50% ) was 450 \u00b0C for 6% CuO/TiO 2 and 375 \u00b0C for 18% CuO/TiO 2 . Calcining heat also affected the catalytic activities. For example, 6% CuO/TiO 2 calcined at 750 \u00b0C had higher activity than those calcined at 500 or 850 \u00b0C ( Fig. 4 ). The catalyst calcined at 500 \u00b0C had higher activity than that calcined at 850 \u00b0C at low reaction temperatures, compared to an opposite finding at high reaction temperatures. When calcined at 850 \u00b0C, the catalytic activity began to decrease at the temperatures of above 500 \u00b0C, probably due to the SMSI action [11] . 3.3 Activities of CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 in NO + CO reaction As shown in Fig. 5 , the NO conversion temperatures of 6% CuO/TiO 2 were 280 \u00b0C at T 50% and 450 \u00b0C at T 99% . By comparison, both 6% CuO\u20135% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 and 12% CuO\u20135% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 had a NO conversion temperature of 350 \u00b0C at T 99% . We assume that ZrO 2 addition increased the catalytic activity in NO + CO reaction, whereas CuO addition made little contribution to the catalytic activity even if the loading of CuO increased to 12%. It was also found that both 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 and 6% CuO\u201315% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 had a NO conversion temperature of 325 \u00b0C at T 99% ( Fig. 6 ), suggesting that excessive addition of ZrO 2 would not further increase the catalytic activity. At low reaction temperature, 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 calcined at 500 \u00b0C had higher activity in NO + CO reaction than that calcined at 750 or 850 \u00b0C, and similar catalytic activities were observed when calcined at 750 and 850 \u00b0C ( Fig. 7 ). However, the catalysts calcined at 500, 750 or 850 \u00b0C had almost the same conversion temperature ( T 99% ), indicating that 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 calcined at 750 \u00b0C had better heat stability. 3.4 Effects of reaction temperature on NO, CO conversion and N 2 selectivity Table 1 shows the effects of reaction temperature on NO, CO conversion and N 2 selectivity of 6% CuO/TiO 2 and 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 catalysts. It was found that NO and CO concentrations decreased but N 2 and CO 2 concentrations increased with the increase in reaction temperature. At 150 \u00b0C, the amount of N 2 , CO 2 and N 2 O and the conversions of NO and CO increased markedly. A continuous increase in N 2 and CO 2 but a decrease in N 2 O was observed at 200 \u00b0C. At 300 \u00b0C, NO and CO conversions were 66.7, 70.6% by 6% CuO/TiO 2 , and 98.9, 96.9% by 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 , respectively. At 350 \u00b0C, NO and CO were almost completely converted by 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 compared with 91.3 and 85.6% by 6% CuO/TiO 2 , respectively. These results indicate that N 2 O was formed during the initial stage of the reaction at lower temperature and increased with the increase in temperature until a maximal amount of N 2 O was reached. Further increase in temperature, however, caused a gradual decrease in N 2 O. In contrast, the amount of N 2 increased continuously with increase in temperature. It can be suggested that in the process of NO reduction with CO, the reactant molecules (NO and CO) were firstly adsorbed on the adsorption sites of catalyst surface in forms of NO(a) and CO(a), and the adsorbed NO(a) then dissociated into N(a) and O(a), followed by reactions of N(a) with NO(a) and CO(a) with O(a) to produce N 2 (ads) and CO 2 , and N 2 formation by two N(a). This study also showed that the rate of NO(a) dissociation on the catalyst surface was slower at low temperature and its reaction with N(a) formed N 2 O(ads). As the reaction temperature increased, the rate of NO(a) dissociation became faster, causing a decrease in NO(a) concentration. As a result, high temperature was not beneficial to N 2 O(a) formation. Therefore, the catalytic activities in the NO + CO reaction were not only related to the dispersion state of active components on TiO 2 but also to the rate of NO adsorption and dissociation on the catalyst surfaces. 3.5 Activities of CuO/TiO 2 catalysts in H 2 atmosphere Fig. 8 shows the activities of CuO/TiO 2 with different CuO loading in H 2 atmosphere for NO + CO reaction. The sample treated in H 2 possessed higher catalytic activity than that treated in air. The catalytic activity increased with the increase in temperature and the CuO loading from 1 to 18%. The catalysts treated in H 2 had higher activity than that treated in air. For example, 6% CuO/TiO 2 showed 50% NO conversation at reaction temperature of 450 \u00b0C in air compared to 150 \u00b0C in H 2 . Calcining temperature also affected the catalytic activity in NO + CO reaction. As shown in Fig. 9 , the NO conversion of 6% CuO/TiO 2 decreased with the increase in calcining temperature. The reaction temperature of 99% NO conversion was 300 \u00b0C and 375 \u00b0C in H 2 atmosphere when the calcining temperature was 500 and 750 \u00b0C, respectively. At reaction temperature of 500 \u00b0C, the catalyst calcined at 850 \u00b0C only had 74.84% NO conversion. Fig. 10 displays the effects of H 2 treatment and ZrO 2 addition on catalytic activity of the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts in NO + CO reaction. After treatment in H 2 , the catalytic activity increased significantly, especially for 6% CuO/TiO 2 . The order of the catalytic activities was, 6% CuO/TiO 2 > 12% CuO\u20135% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 > 6% CuO\u20135% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 . The activity of 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 calcined at 500 \u00b0C was similar to that calcined at 750 \u00b0C, but decreased dramatically at calcining temperature of 850 \u00b0C in H 2 atmosphere ( Fig. 11 ), indicating that calcination at high temperature suppressed the catalytic activities. The NO conversion temperature ( T 99% ) were 300 and 350 \u00b0C for the catalysts calcined at 750 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively, which attributed to the different selectivities of N 2 O. 3.6 XRD analysis of CuO/TiO 2 and CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 As shown in Fig. 12 (line 1), there was a diffraction peak of anatase at 2 \u03b8 25.2\u00b0, 37.0\u00b0 and 48.1\u00b0 but not a rutile phase after TiO 2 was calcined at 450 \u00b0C for 4 h. Two CuO diffraction peaks were obvious between 2 \u03b8 35.5\u00b0 and 38.7\u00b0 plus a diffraction peak of anatase phase (line 2), indicating that the CuO on TiO 2 had transformed from highly dispersion CuO species to a CuO crystal phase. After addition of ZrO 2 (5\u201315%), the diffraction peak of ZrO 2 was not detected (lines 3 and 4) and the diffraction peak intensity of CuO did not increase either. Likely, it was the strong interaction between CuO and ZrO 2 that enhanced the activity and stability of catalyst. XRD also detected a mixture phase of anatase and rutile after the catalysts were calcined at 750 \u00b0C for 2 h (line 5). After 6% CuO/TiO 2 and 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 were pretreated at 500 \u00b0C for 1 h in H 2 , the CuO diffraction peaks ( d =2.52 and 2.33) disappeared but Cu diffraction peaks ( d =2.09 and 1.80) were detected, as shown in lines 6\u20138. By comparison, the catalysts calcined at 750 \u00b0C for 2 h in both H 2 and air atmospheres, the diffraction peaks of rutile ( d =3.25, 2.48 and 1.68) became much stronger additional to the conversion of CuO to Cu. The results indicate that the components changed and a strong interaction took place between the CuO and ZrO 2 \u2013TiO 2 compound. Based on the results of this study and a previous study by Yasuaki and Hideki [12] , we suggest that in H 2 atmosphere CuO produced dispersed Cu 0 species, and after one NO molecule on the Cu 0 sites formed a mononitrosyl Cu 0 species another NO molecule reacted with the mononitrosyl Cu 0 species to produce N 2 O and an unstable dinitrosyl intermediate, and then returned back to Cu 0 species, i.e. a continuous redox cycle involving Cu 2+ and Cu 0 . It was likely that NO reacted with a mononitrosyl Cu 0 species to form N 2 and dispersed Cu 0 species. 3.7 NO-TPD analysis After the surface of 6% CuO/TiO 2 adsorbed NO, thermal desorption took place as a dissociation reaction, and four desorption species (NO, m / e =30; N 2 O, m / e =44; N 2 , m / e =28 and O 2 , m / e =32) were detected ( Figs. 13 and 14 ). A 6% CuO/TiO 2 pretreated in air atmosphere had three NO desorption peaks, i.e. three and four NO adsorption centers, and the desorption peak temperatures were 100, 160 and 200 \u00b0C. When the catalyst was pretreated in H 2 , its NO desorption also had three desorption peaks, one peak due to NO adsorption at weak sites and the other two peaks due to NO adsorption at strong sites, and desorption peak temperatures were 100, 150 and 220 \u00b0C. After 10% ZrO 2 was added into 6% CuO/TiO 2 , four NO desorption peaks occurred at 60, 100, 150 and 180 \u00b0C, indicating that NO desorption by CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 was easier than that by CuO/TiO 2 . In addition, desorption peak temperature of NO by 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 was lower than that by 6% CuO/TiO 2 , i.e. the former catalyst had higher NO dissociation activity than the latter catalyst. Both catalysts also showed N 2 O desorption peak at low temperatures but N 2 desorption peak at high temperatures, indicating the production of N 2 O and N 2 in NO + CO reaction. The NO-TPD analysis of both catalysts also detected NO but not O 2 desorption peak. It was likely that NO dissociation produced atomic oxygen (O) that dispersed or entered into the bulk of Cu [13,14] , and the desorption of atomic oxygen could only occur at high temperatures. As all the NO-TPD spectra have shown that NO is the major desorption species, we compared the NO-TPD spectra of NO after NO adsorption by 6% CuO/TiO 2 with that by 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 in order to explain the higher catalytic activity in H 2 atmosphere than in air atmosphere. The adsorption\u2013desorption process of NO absorbed on the different active sites of catalyst surface is very complex because of the complexity of catalyst structure. As shown in Fig. 15 , while the desorption temperature decreased markedly and the number of adsorption sites increased in H 2 atmosphere, the total amount of NO desorption in H 2 atmosphere was almost the same as that in air atmosphere, indicating that catalytic activity increased with the decrease in NO desorption temperature and the increase in active cites but was not related to the amount of NO desorption. In addition, since CuO became Cu in the process of H 2 reduction, we suggest that the desorption peak at 100 \u00b0C corresponded to the Cu adsorption site and played some role in the increment of catalytic activity. The NO desorption peaks of 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 (750 \u00b0C) showed little change in shapes before and after H 2 pretreatment ( Fig. 16 ). However, the amount of NO desorption increased after H 2 pretreatment, followed by increment in dissociation activity and N 2 desorption, and as a result, the catalytic activity increased. 3.8 The mechanisms of NO + CO reaction by CuO/TiO 2 and CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 catalysts It is widely known that the mechanisms of NO + CO reaction are as the followings [12,15,16] : (1) CO + s \u2194 CO(a) (2) NO + s \u2194 NO(a) (3) NO ( a )+ s \u2192 N ( a )+ O ( a ) (4) CO ( a )+ O ( a )\u2192 CO 2 +2 s (5) NO ( a )+ N ( a )\u2192 N 2 O ( a )+ s (6) NO ( a )+ N ( a )\u2192 N 2 + O ( a )+ s (7) N 2 O ( a )\u2192 N 2 O + s (8) N 2 O ( a )\u2192 N 2 + O ( a ) (9) N ( a )+ N ( a )\u2192 N 2 +2 s where \u2018s\u2019 represents the adsorption site and \u2018a\u2019 the adsorption status. We think the above mechanisms also apply to the NO + CO reaction by CuO/TiO 2 and CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 and the dissociation of NO(a) might be the rate-determining step of NO + CO reaction. NO(a) hardly dissociated at low temperature and the rate of step (9) was also very slow, and thus more NO(a) would exist on the catalyst surface and easily reacted with the N(a) to form N 2 O (step (5)). As a result, N 2 O was detected as main intermediate product at low temperatures. The formation of N 2 may mainly attribute to the reaction between absorbed N atom and absorbed N molecule (step (6)). By comparison, the rate of NO(a) dissociation was very fast at high temperature (step (3)) and the amount of NO(a) on the catalyst surface was very little, suppressing the formation of N 2 O. Moreover, N 2 O dissociation easily at high temperature also decreased the amount of N 2 O, and N 2 was the main product at high temperature. The Cu species also have great effect in the process of NO(a) dissociation beside temperature. The catalytic activity in H 2 atmosphere was higher than in air, so we think that the process of dissociation occurred at the Cu 0 active sites, forming more N(a) and O(a) but remaining less undissociated NO(a). Comparing to step (7), the reaction rate of step (9) was very fast, so at the same temperature the undissociated NO(a) would be less on the catalysts having Cu 0 , and more N 2 and less N 2 O were formed. 4 Conclusions (1) The activities of CuO/TiO 2 catalysts pretreated in H 2 were much higher than those pretreated in air at 500 \u00b0C for 1 h. The NO conversion temperatures of 6% CuO/TiO 2 were 280 \u00b0C at T 50% and 450 \u00b0C at T 99% , compared to 325 \u00b0C at T 99% for 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 . In H 2 atmosphere, the NO conversion temperature of 6% CuO\u201310% ZrO 2 /TiO 2 decreased to 300 \u00b0C at T 99% . (2) An addition of 5% ZrO 2 into CuO/TiO 2 calcined at 750 and 850 \u00b0C for 2 h caused small changes in anti-high temperature property, whereas 10% ZrO 2 addition significantly increased the catalytic activities, thermal stability and N 2 selectivity in the NO + CO reaction. (3) The catalysts pretreated in air displayed CuO diffraction peaks, whereas those pretreated in H 2 displayed Cu diffraction peaks. (4) Four desorption species (NO, N 2 O, N 2 and O 2 ) were produced during the thermal desorption of NO adsorbed on CuO/TiO 2 and CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 . ZrO 2 addition into CuO/TiO 2 shifted the NO desorption peaks towards low temperature, indicating that the NO dissociation activity of CuO\u2013ZrO 2 /TiO 2 was higher than that of CuO/TiO 2 .

        "abstract": "A series of novel catalysts consisting of V-Cs-Cu-Tl supported on TiO 2 and SiC were prepared by impregnation method and tested for their catalytic properties to selectivity oxidation from p - tert -butyl toluene to p - tert -butyl benzaldehyde. A very significant effect was obtained with a selectivity of about 80 mol% and the conversion of 12 mol% over the series of catalysts. The surface properties of the series of V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst were discussed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The results of XPS analysis pointed out the small decrease of the vanadium binding energies and increase in the peak area of nucleophilic oxygen (O 2\u2212 ) with the promoter thallium adding into V-Cs-Cu catalyst. The optimum catalytic activity for the series of V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst was probably ascribed to the promoter thallium which effectively enhanced the redox cycle of V 5+ \u2194V 4+ . In addition, O 1s analysis of catalyst indicated that the nucleophilic oxygen on the catalyst surface plays an important role in this selectivity oxidation. Such typical results were summarized and the role of thallium promoter was explained. Keywords XPS Selective oxidation Catalyst Thallium promoter",

The results indicate that when Cr/Mo molar ratio is 0.07, the CH4 conversion and aromatics selectivity reach 11.6% and 97-2% respectively. Raising temperature is beneficial to the CH4 conversion and a 15.8% of CH4 conversion is obtained at 1 023 K. The catalyst pretreated with N2 is better than that with H2 and CH4. The NH3-TPD-MS results show that the Mo-Cr/HZSM-5 catalyst has more sites of strong acidity and mid-strong acidity than Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. The results of decomposition of isopropanol show that the surface acidity on Mo-Cr/HZSM-5 is increased at high temperature. This might be one of the reasons that the activity for methane aromatization is increased over Mo-Cr/HZSM-5 catalyst.",

        "abstract": "Supported silver catalysts showed good activity for hydrogen production from partial oxidation of methanol (POM) at a low temperature of 160 \u00b0C. Ag/CeO 2 \u2013ZnO catalysts, prepared by the method of redox coprecipitation, displayed distinguished hydrogen selectivity ( S H 2 ) and methanol conversion. In preparation of the catalysts, Ag + ions were found reduced into metal clusters by Ce 3+ ions. X-ray diffraction study revealed that the active silver crystallites were dispersed amorphously on the catalysts. Thermal characterization of temperature programmed hydrogen reduction and temperature programmed hydrogen desorption further suggested that CeO 2 and ZnO played different roles in the high S H 2 over Ag/CeO 2 \u2013ZnO. Promoter CeO 2 served as a spillover sink to collect hydrogen dissociated on silver crystallites while ZnO acted as a porthole for a fast desorption of hydrogen from the catalyst. These two oxides corporately raised the high S H 2 over Ag/CeO 2 \u2013ZnO catalysts.",

The catalysts have been characterized by using TPR and XRD. Only a small amount of Mn (10%) is needed to form active sites for CO oxidation, and the excess Mn oxide form bulk MnO2 particles which may cover a part of the active Mn oxide species resulting in the decrease of the catalytic activity. The catalytic activity also depends on the calcination temperature. The optimum calcination temperature is 600\u00b0C. Two reduction peaks are observed in all Mn/CeO2(400\u00b0C) catalyst. The low-temperature peak is attributed to reduction of MnO2 or/and Mn2O3 to form Mn3O4; while the high-temperature peak is attributed to the reduction of Mn3O4 forming MnO. The MnO species on the reduced catalyst is more easily reoxidized to Mn3O4 than to MnO2. The average valence number of Mn atom in the catalyst decreases with increase in calcination temperature, and increases with Mn loading.",

        "abstract": "Four perovskite-type precursors (LaNiO 3 , La 2 NiO 4 , LaCoO 3 and La 2 CoO 4 ) were successfully prepared by Pechini method and were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction technique (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After reduction, their catalytic activity toward CO 2 reforming of CH 4 was tested in a fixed-bed reactor. It was found that Ni-based La 2 NiO 4 catalyst, after calcinations at 850 or 1100 \u00b0C, was quite active and stable with CH 4 conversion of 72% and 75%, respectively. It was proposed that the well-defined structure and La 2 O 2 CO 3 phase might be responsible for the unusual catalytic behavior observed over the catalyst.",

Characterizations (NH 3 -TPD-MS and pore structure) disclosed that the catalytic activity of various zeolites depends mainly on its strong acid site and accessibility of the internal pores. H-beta zeolite, with a unique pore sized in 0.66 nm and higher proportion of stronger acid site, exhibited the highest activity and stereo-selectivity (86.5%). Small sized H-beta zeolite was more active due to the enhanced accessibility of its acid site, and this kind of zeolite remained a higher stereo-selectivity (>80%) even at higher temperature, longer reaction time and recycle usage. The best yield of para \u2013 para \u2032-DMDPM reached 71.1% at 140\u00b0C over H-beta zeolite and it could be used in recycle without loss of its structure, activity and stereo-selectivity.",

The results showed that the activity of these catalysts follows the order of Amberlite resin >SO 4 2-/ZrO 2 > HZSM-5. These catalysts are also different in their tolerance to water present in the bio-oil. The catalytic activity of SO 4 2-/ZrO 2 decreases obviously with increasing water concentration in the reaction mixture, while Amberlite resin still exhibits a high catalytic activity in the presence of water. After catalytic upgrading of crude bio-oil under microwave heating with the cation exchange resin as the catalyst, most of the organic acids are converted into various esters through esterification with ethanol. Microwave heating is more effective than conventional heating and the components of bio-oil are then better upgraded under microwave heating.",

Compared to Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 , the Ni/MgO-\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 and Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalysts exhibit higher activity and better stability using a stoichiometric feed ratio (1:1). The MgAl 2 O 4 spinel layer in Ni/MgO-\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 can effectively suppress the phase transformation to form NiAl 2 O 4 spinel phases and can stabilize the Ni tiny crystallites, to which the good stability of the catalyst contributes. The application of magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl 2 O 4 ) prepared by the co-precipitation method as a support of Ni catalysts can give a high active catalytic system with excellent stability under reaction conditions. The high sintering-resistance ability and low acidity of MgAl 2 O 4 compared to \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 and the interactions between Ni and MgAl 2 O 4 might be responsible for its high activity and resistant to coking and sintering, because it can produce a highly dispersed active Ni species.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an optimal way to prepare a new material of nano-sized Ce\u2013Zr\u2013Ba mixed oxide powder is firstly reported. It was found that macromolecule surface modified and azeotropy distill treatment are key factors for controlling particle size and increasing surface area. This new preparation method has the advantages of convenience and inexpensive. Under the optimized preparation conditions, the particle size and surface area of obtained powder are 30\u201350 nm and 119.0 m 2 /g, respectively. The new material of Ce\u2013Zr\u2013Ba mixed oxide offers certain advantages in the use of TWC catalyst. The physical and chemistry properties, crystalline structure, particle sizes, and thermostability are characterized by using XRD, TEM, BET and TGA\u2013DTA techniques. As a comparison, the sample prepared by sol\u2013gel method is also discussed. Keywords Preparation method Ce\u2013Zr\u2013Ba High surface area Nano-sized",

        "abstract": "The activities of CuO supported on TiO2 and ceria-modified TiO2 in catalyzing the NO reduction by CO have been examined with a microreactor-GC NO+CO reaction system, and the catalysts characterized by physical adsorption, TPR, XRD and NO-TPD. The CuO/TiO2 and CuO/CeO2-TiO2 catalysts increase the NO reduction by CO, probably due to the surface dispersed CuO and fine CuO crystallites. Pore structure data show that the pore size distribution of TiO2 is mainly as micro-pores and meso-pores, and the adsorption-desorption isotherm is the type IV of BDDT classification. TPR profiles indicate that Cu-Ti has four TPR peaks, \u03b1 peak from highly dispersed CuO species, \u03b2 peak from oxide clusters with a structure similar to CuO, \u03b3 peak from CuO crystallites and \u03b4 peak from the interaction of CuO and TiO2, TiO2 surface oxygen reduction. In addition, the phase change of TiO2 doesn't show negative influence in catalytic activities. Among the tested catalysts, the catalyst with 12% CuO loading has the highest activity for NO+CO reaction, but at CuO loading of \u22653%, a crystallite of CuO has already been formed, which means that besides highly dispersed CuO, the CuO crystallite also plays an important role in NO+CO reaction, and the catalytic activities have a close relation with the CuO crystallite size and its micro structure data. NO-TPD profile also shows that the catalytic activities are closely related to NO dissociation - a rate-determining step for the NO+CO reaction, but are not affected by the amount of adsorbed NO.",

The etherification of glycerol performed on acid catalysts, such as H-ZSM5, H-\u03b2, tungstophosphoric acid (HPW), FeCl 3, AlCl 3, and H 2SO 4, was found. Basic catalysts (such as alkaline earth oxides, MgO) are inactive for the reaction. Bulk HPW and SiO 2-supported HPW catalysts exhibited the highest activity among the tested catalysts, with a 97.1% conversion of glycerol. Over the HPW catalyst, the etherification reactions were carried out at different temperatures, varied ratios between ethanol and glycerol, different catalyst amounts, and different reaction times. The SiO 2-supported HPW catalyst has a high initial activity, but it deactivated gradually because of the leaching of HPW. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

The XRD results indicate that the interlayer spacing of the montmorillonite is increased from 1.27 nm to 1.78 nm after zirconium and yttrium cation pillaring. N2 adsorption-desorption results show that a great increase in BET specific surface area (from 62 to 395 m~2\u00b7g~-1) is found for Na-MMT pillared with zirconium and yttrium. It is also found that Zr-Y-MMT is more active than Na-MMT for the complete oxidation of acetone, toluene and ethyl acetate, and the temperature for the said catalytic oxidation can be lowered to 320 \u2103, 350 \u2103 and 290 \u2103, respectively.

The Ce-Zr-O solid solution prepared with different methods shows the different reduction properties owing to different phase composition.

        "title": "Dimethyl ether synthesis via methanol and syngas over rare earth metals modified zeolite Y and dual Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn catalysts",
        "abstract": "A series of zeolite Y modified with La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu were prepared via ion-exchange, and characterized by XRD, FT-IR and NH 3 -TPD. It was found that these rare earth metals were encapsulated in the supercage of zeolite Y and resulted in its enhanced acidity. Among them, La-, Ce-, Pr- and Nd-modified zeolite Y exhibited higher activity and stability (than pure HY) for methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether (DME). For DME synthesis directly from CO hydrogenation using the dual Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/modified-Y catalysts, it was found that Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/La\u2013Y and Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Ce\u2013Y were more active than Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/pure-HY. The conversion of CO on Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Ce\u2013HY achieved 77.1% in an isothermal fixed bed reactor at 245 \u00b0C, 2.0 MPa, H 2 /CO = 3/2 and 1500 h \u22121 . Keywords Dimethyl ether Methanol Zeolite Y 1 Introduction Dimethyl ether (DME) has been utilized as alternate fuel for vehicle engines instead of diesel, and as fuel additive and family cooking gas instead of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [1] . Compared with the traditional chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs, Freon) and newer R-134a (HFC-134a), DME and fluoro-dimethyl ether are also widely used in environmental friendly aerosol spray and green refrigerant because of their zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and lower globe warming potential (GWP) [2] . Therefore, production and utilization of DME have attracted ever-increasing attentions due to both the need of environmental protection and the increased price of crude oil. DME is traditionally produced via methanol dehydration Eq. (1) catalyzed by liquid sulfate acid (or phosphate acid) and/or solid acids [3\u201312] : (1) 2 CH 3 OH \u2192 CH 3 OCH 3 + H 2 O ( \u0394 G = - 12.1 kJ , 250 \u00b0 C ) And methanol is synthesized from CO hydrogenation: (2) CO + 2 H 2 \u2192 CH 3 OH ( \u0394 G = 26.7 kJ , 250 \u00b0 C ) Several solid-acid catalysts such as HZSM-5, H-beta, alumina and SAPOs were reported for methanol dehydration in a temperature range of 250\u2013400 \u00b0C [3\u201312] . However, most of these solid-acid catalysts produce undesirable side products such as hydrocarbons (and coke) due to the presence of strong acid sites and the high dehydration temperature [8,9] . Thus, extensive research has been focused on finding better catalysts that have higher selectivity for the DME formation and less tendency to generate hydrocarbons (and coke formation) [6] . It has recent been found that DME formation is mainly related to these active sites with weak and medium acidity, and those catalysts with strong acid sites may be preferable for coke deposition [6\u201312] . And the strong acid sites must be diluted (such as modification of ZSM-5 with Na and/or \u03b3-alumina matrix) in order to achieve a high stability against coke formation and formed water [13] . In addition, recent efforts have focused on the directly synthesis of DME from the synthesis gas (CO + H 2 ) using a mechanically mixed methanol synthesis catalyst (Cu\u2013Zn\u2013Al) and methanol dehydration catalyst (alumina or zeolite) in the same reactor, a process termed \u201csynthesis gas to dimethyl ether\u201d (abbreviated as STD) [14\u201320] . (3) 2 CO + 4 H 2 \u2192 CH 3 OCH 3 + H 2 O ( \u0394 G = 41.3 kJ , 250 \u00b0 C ) (4) CO + H 2 O \u2192 CO 2 + H 2 ( \u0394 G = - 19.5 kJ , 250 \u00b0 C ) During STD, steam formed in hydrogenation step Eq. (3) reacts quickly with CO via a water\u2013gas shift reaction Eq. (4) , and the overall stoichiometric reaction is expressed as follows: (5) 3 CO + 3 H 2 \u2192 CH 3 OCH 3 + CO 2 ( \u0394 G = 21.7 kJ , 250 \u00b0 C ) The overall process seems more favorable thermodynamically than the separated methanol synthesis Eq. (2) [21] , and very high CO conversion was reported in a temperature-gradient reactor [22] . Moreover, this process also has several advantages in terms of both economical and technical aspects including lower energy requirement. CuO\u2013ZnO\u2013Al 2 O 3 /NaHZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst exhibits high activity and stability for this process at 275 \u00b0C even when CO 2 is fed and there is a high water concentration in the medium [23,24] . In this process, methanol synthesis and dehydration take place consecutively on the dual catalyst. However, the hydrogenation step (from CO to methanol) and dehydration step (from methanol to DME) must be matched completely in order to achieve a higher DME yield. Traditionally, the dual catalysts for synthesizing DME from syngas were prepared using a mechanically mixed methanol synthesis catalyst (Cu\u2013Zn\u2013Al or Cu\u2013Zn\u2013Zr) and methanol dehydration catalyst (Al 2 O 3 or zeolite) [14\u201322] . Up to now, only a few solid acids, such as \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 [15,19\u201324] , HZSM-5 [16\u201324] , silica\u2013alumina [16,18,20] , have been utilized as dehydration catalysts for the STD process. Among them, \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 received most attention because of its lower cost and less byproducts. It is also well known that the STD process must be carried out at higher temperature (>280 \u00b0C) because the acidity of \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 is not strong enough for the consecutive methanol dehydration [15,20\u201326] . Under such severe conditions, carbon deposition happens on the surface of CuO\u2013ZnO\u2013Al 2 O 3 /\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalyst [23] . However, in theory, this reaction requires a much lower reaction temperature because it is an exothermic process [21] . Consistent with this hypothesis, previous work demonstrated that Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y prepared via a coprecipitation impregnation procedure could catalyze the STD process at 245 \u00b0C with a moderate activity, whereas the physically mixed Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn and \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 must be operated at a higher temperature (>260 \u00b0C) [25\u201327] . In this report, the dehydration component (zeolite Y) was modified with several rare earth metals, and used as the catalyst for methanol dehydration and as the dehydration component of the dual catalyst for the DME synthesis. The properties of these catalysts were fully characterized by XRD, FT-IR and NH 3 -TPD. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation A powder zeolite NH 4 Y (Si/Al = 6, BET surface area 420 m 2 /g) was firstly ion-exchanged in each of an acidic aqueous solution of La 3+ , Ce 3+ , Pr 2+ , Nd 3+ , Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ at 90 \u00b0C under reflux for 4 h, then the solid was filtered, washed, dried and finally calcined at 500 \u00b0C for 5 h. This process was repeated 3\u20135 times in order to obtain an equal amount of rare earth metal in the modified zeolite. Atom adsorption spectroscopy (AAS) analysis indicated that rare earth metal in modified zeolite were in 1.9\u20132.0 wt%. At the same time, each of 2 wt% of La 2 O 3 and CeO 2 modified zeolite HY was prepared via mechanically mixing method (denoted as La 2 O 3 \u2013HY and CeO 2 \u2013HY), calcined at 500 \u00b0C for 5 h and utilized as the reference samples for methanol dehydration and discussion. Hydrogenation catalyst, Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn (Cu/Mn/Zn = 2/4/1 mol ratio), was prepared by traditional coprecipitation method. An aqueous solution containing Cu 2+ , Mn 2+ and Zn 2+ with the total metal ion concentration of 1.0 mol/L was dropwise mixed with an aqueous solution of Na 2 CO 3 (0.5 mol/L) under stirring at 50 \u00b0C. In the course of coprecipitation, pH was controlled at 10 by the simultaneous dripping of an aqueous NaOH solution (3.0 mol/L). This suspension was maintained at 50 \u00b0C for 24 h with stirring, then filtered off and washed with distilled water, dried overnight at 120 \u00b0C in air and calcined at 450 \u00b0C for 3 h. The dual catalysts were prepared via mechanically mixing of the modified zeolite Y (10 g) and the Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn catalyst (20 g). A controlled amount of water (about 0.8 g/g-solid) was added in order to make the two components mixed completely. The mixed powder was dried at 110 \u00b0C for 5 h, and further calcined at 450 \u00b0C for 3 h. These powder catalysts were compressed, ground and sieved to 20\u201340 mesh for catalytic reaction. 2.2 Characterizations XRD analysis was performed in an automated power X-ray diffraction system (Cu K\u03b1 radiation, 45 kV, 40 mA) (Rigaku RINT 2500, Japan). IR spectra were obtained using the KBr method in a Nicolet 560 (USA) system. NH 3 -TPD experiment was performed in an auto-catalytic adsorption system (AMI-200, Zeton Altamira, Pittsburgh, USA), using an on-line thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and quartz tubular reactor. Sample was pretreated at 500 \u00b0C in argon flow for 1 h and then cooled to 50 \u00b0C. Ammonia (20% NH 3 /Ar) was introduced at a flow rate of 30 mL/min for 0.5 h at 50 \u00b0C, and then blown by argon until a constant TCD level was attained; the reactor temperature was programmed to increase at a ramp rate of 10 \u00b0C/min, and the amount of ammonia in effluent was measured via TCD and recorded as function of temperature. 2.3 Catalytic reaction Methanol dehydration experiment was carried out in a high-pressure microreactor system (MRCS8400, Huayang, China) under the following procedure: sample (0.5 g) was placed into a stainless-steel isothermal fixed bed reactor, pretreated at 270 \u00b0C in Ar for 3 h, cooled to 245 \u00b0C and then shifted to a mixed 20% methanol/Ar gas (50 ml/min). Products in effluent were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (HP5890, Series II, Hewlett-Packard) with a thermal conductivity detector. Carbon formed on spent catalysts during methanol dehydration process was detected by TG (SDT Q600, USA) in 10% O 2 (100 mL/min, Ar in balance) from 100 to 750 \u00b0C, 10 \u00b0C/min. DME synthesis from synthesis gas (CO + H 2 ) was performed in the same equipment under 245 \u00b0C, 2.0 MPa, and a space velocity of 1500 h \u22121 (H 2 30 ml/min and CO 20 ml/min). Catalyst (20\u201340 mesh, 2 mL, about 2.0 g) was reduced in H 2 at 270 \u00b0C for 3 h under atmospheric pressure. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis The XRD spectrum of HY and La-, Ce-, Pr-, Nd-, Sm-, Eu-modified zeolite Y prepared via ion-exchange and La 2 O 3 \u2013HY, CeO 2 \u2013HY prepared via mechanically mixing are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . It was found that no free rare earth metals were detected in samples prepared via ion-exchange and there are distinctive changes in the main crystal structure of zeolite Y. The relative intensity of (3 1 1), (3 3 1) and (5 3 3) planes increased in modified zeolite Y, with the intensity of plane (3 3 1) being the strongest compared with the plane (1 1 1) in pure zeolite Y ( Fig. 1 ). La 2 O 3 \u2013HY and CeO 2 \u2013HY prepared via mechanically mixing exhibited quite similar XRD spectrum as that of pure zeolite Y, and free La(OH) 3 and CeO 2 were detected in these samples ( Fig. 2 ). Based on the standard XRD spectrum of pure zeolite Y (JCPDS card 81-2467) [28] and La-modified zeolite Y (JCPDS card 77-0029) [29] , it clearly suggests that rare earth metals enter the supercage of zeolite Y. The increased intensity of (3 1 1), (3 3 1) and (5 3 3) planes in modified zeolite Y indicate that these rare earth atoms have strong contact interaction with the matrix of the zeolite. Furthermore, the rare earth metal is covalently bonded to three O(3) and with weaker bonding to the other three O(3) in the supercage (S(I), S(I\u2032) and S(II)) of zeolite Y [30] . FTIR analysis results also confirmed that free La(OH) 3 (at 1467 and 1502 cm \u22121 , [31] ) and CeO 2 (1500\u20131600 cm \u22121 , [32] ) existed on the surface of La 2 O 3 \u2013HY and CeO 2 \u2013HY prepared via mechanically mixing, whereas no rare earth metal was detected in those samples prepared via ion-exchange ( Fig. 3 ). XRD spectrum of these dual catalysts of Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn catalyst mixed with pure HY and La-, Ce-, Pr-, Nd-, Sm- and Eu-modified zeolite Y (prepared via ion-exchange) are shown in Fig. 4 . Beside zeolite Y, CuMn 2 O 4 (JCPDS card 84-0543) and Zn 2 Mn 3 O 8 (JCPDS card 32-1472) were detected [14,26,27] . These results demonstrated that Mn played a very important role in bonding Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn strongly in the dual catalysts. Free \u03b1-MnO 2 (JCPDS card 44-0141) and ZnO (JCPDS card 03-0752) were detected in Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Pr\u2013Y, Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Nd\u2013Y and Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Sm\u2013Y. The appearance of free \u03b1 -MnO 2 and ZnO might be derived from the decomposition of Zn 2 Mn 3 O 8 after mixing because of the strong acidity of Nd\u2013Y and Sm\u2013Y. 3.2 Surface acidity of modified Y prepared via ion-exchange NH 3 -TPD profiles of HY and each of La-, Ce-, Pr-, Nd-, Sm- and Eu-modified zeolite Y prepared via ion-exchange are shown in Fig. 5 . Three NH 3 desorption peaks were detected in the range of 140\u2013340 \u00b0C ( T 1 ), 340\u2013490 \u00b0C ( T 2 ) and 490\u2013640 \u00b0C ( T 3 ). These peaks were deconvoluted, and the acidity of each peak was calculated according to the desorbed amount of NH 3 (and summarized in Table 1 ). It was found that the acidity of the first peak ( T 1 ) in all samples is similar, and this part of acid sites was designated as the contribution of the matrix of the zeolite [5\u20137,33\u201335] . The amount of acid sites in middle strength (peak T 2 ) increased obviously in La\u2013Y, Ce\u2013Y and Pr\u2013Y, and the amount of acid sites in strong strength (peak T 3 ) increased in Nd\u2013Y and Sm\u2013Y. Except Eu\u2013Y, the total amount of acid sites increased in rare earth metal modified zeolite Y. According to the XRD analysis results and published papers [28\u201330] , it was inferred that the distorted coordination of Ln\u2013O bond in supercage would enhance the acidity of zeolite Y. 3.3 Methanol dehydration over HY and modified Y The activity of HY and each of La-, Ce-, Pr-, Nd-, Sm-, Eu-modified zeolite Y prepared via ion-exchange and La 2 O 3 \u2013HY and CeO 2 \u2013HY prepared via mechanically mixing for methanol dehydration to DME are summarized in Table 2 . It was found that the initial methanol conversion increased with the acidity of modified Y (acidity was summarized in Table 1 ). HY had a lower initial methanol conversion (87.5%) and a lower DME selectivity (92.1%), and these data decreased quickly to 46.2% and 85.2% during 10 h on stream. On La\u2013Y, Ce\u2013Y, Pr\u2013Y and Nd\u2013Y, the initial methanol conversion increased (>92.0%), and their performance kept in a high level during 10 h on stream. Sm\u2013Y and Eu\u2013Y also exhibited higher activity for methanol conversion, but their stability changed little compared with that of HY. La 2 O 3 \u2013HY and CeO 2 \u2013HY showed similar performance as HY for methanol dehydration. That is, La 2 O 3 and/or CeO 2 added to zeolite Y via mechanically mixing has no promotion on the performance of methanol dehydration. Table 2 summarized the amount of coke formed on spent catalysts of methanol dehydration during 10 h on stream. Small amount of coke formed on spent La\u2013Y, Ce\u2013Y and Pr\u2013Y. But large amount of coke were detected on spent Nd\u2013Y, Sm\u2013Y, HY, La 2 O 3 \u2013HY and CeO 2 \u2013HY, which would be the main reason for their deactivation. Published references confirmed that coke formed during methanol dehydration was mainly long-chain hydrocarbons on the strong Br\u00f6nsted acid centers inside the pores of pure zeolite Y [35,36] . Fig. 6 shows the durability of HY and Ce\u2013Y for methanol dehydration. The detected methanol conversion on HY decreased quickly from 87.5% (2 h) to 83.4 (7 h), 46.2% (10 h), and 19.0% (14 h). An accelerated deactivation was detected after 7 h on stream. But the conversion of methanol on Ce\u2013Y decreased slowly from 94.5% to 74.8% during 120 h on stream, and no clear accelerative deactivation was detected. 3.4 DME synthesis from synthesis gas The activity of HY and each of La-, Ce-, Pr-, Nd-, Sm- and Eu-modified zeolite Y prepared via ion-exchange mixed Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn catalysts for direct DME synthesis from synthesis gas are summarized in Table 3 . The conversion of CO on Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/HY was 66.6% at 245 \u00b0C, 2.0 MPa, CO/H 2 = 2/3 and 1500 h \u22121 . The selectivity of methanol and hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, ethylene and propane, abbreviated as HCs) are 1.6% and 0.1%, respectively. Water\u2013gas shift reaction Eq. (4) took place quickly as the detected selectivity of CO 2 is higher than 30% (nearly half of DME). On Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Ce\u2013Y and Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/La\u2013Y catalysts, the conversion of CO increased to 77.1% and 76.7%, and the product distribution is similar as that of Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/HY. But Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu either depressed the conversion of CO or depressed the selectivity of DME. The selectivity of methanol increased obviously over Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Sm\u2013Y and Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Eu\u2013Y, hydrocarbons increased over Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Pr\u2013Y and Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Sm\u2013Y. These data indicated that those catalysts that have big proportion of middle acid site exhibited higher CO conversion and higher DME selectivity (except Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Pr\u2013Y). The selectivity of hydrocarbons depended mainly on the amount of strong acid site. Fig. 7 shows the durability of Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/HY and Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Ce\u2013Y catalysts for DME synthesis via CO + H 2 . The conversion of CO decreased from 66.5% to 55.2% in 72 h over Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/HY catalyst. While on Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Ce\u2013HY, the conversion of CO only decreased slightly from 77.1% (2 h on stream) to 72.8% during the 210 h on stream. 4 Conclusions In this work, we found that the acidity of zeolite HY was enhanced by the addition of La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm prepared via ion-exchange. These new zeolites exhibited higher activity for methanol dehydration to DME than traditional catalysts. Among them, La- and Ce-modified zeolite Y possess a high proportion of moderate strength acid sites and are more stable for methanol dehydration to DME. More importantly, these new catalysts are particularly useful for \u201csynthesis gas to dimethyl ether\u201d process because the activity of the dual catalyst depends mainly on the amount of moderate strength acid site in its dehydration component since strong acid sites could lead to the formation of hydrocarbons and the decomposition of Zn 2 Mn 3 O 8 in its hydrogenation component.

The prepared catalysts were used to produce syngas from a combined reaction of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane in a fluidized-bed reactor. Ni/SiO2 exhibited excellent resistance to carbon deposition and stable catalytic performance upon promotion with La2O 3. The promoter (La2O3) increased the dispersion of nickel crystallites and prevented their sintering during the reaction. Consequently, the adsorption abilities of oxygen and CO2 were enhanced, and the rate of carbon elimination was therefore increased. Temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray diffraction characterization revealed that the promotion effect of La 2O3 originated from its strong interaction with nickel. \u00a9 American Chemical Society.",

        "title": "Hydrogenolysis of glycerol over homogenously dispersed copper on solid base catalysts",
        "abstract": "Graphical abstract Research highlights \u25b6 Homogenously dispersed copper on layered solid base catalyst was synthesized. \u25b6 The dispersion of Cu was characterized by TEM, N 2 O adsorption and in-situ XRD. \u25b6 This catalyst is extremely effective for hydrogenolysis of glycerol at 180 \u00b0C. \u25b6 The conversion of glycerol depends strongly on the particle size of copper. \u25b6 Solid base can suppress the cleavage of C\u2013C bond in glycerol. Abstract Homogenously dispersed copper on layered solid base (Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP, with 80.1% dispersion of copper) was synthesized via thermal decomposition of the as-synthesized Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 layered double hydroxides. This bi-functional highly dispersed Cu-solid base catalyst is extremely effective for hydrogenolysis of aqueous glycerol. The detected conversion of glycerol reached 80.0% with a 98.2% selectivity of 1,2-propanediol at 180 \u00b0C, 3.0 MPa H 2 and 20 h. But copper dispersed poorly in those catalysts prepared via impregnation and ion-exchange, and their activities were lower. These precursors and catalysts were characterized by N 2 -adsorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscope, transmission electronic microscope, thermo-gravimetry, temperature-programmed reduction with H 2 , in-situ XRD, dissociative N 2 O adsorption and CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption. It was confirmed that the as-synthesized Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 showed a well crystallized layer-structure of hydrotalcite and copper dispersed homogenously on the layer-structure of hydrotalcite after thermal decomposition and H 2 reduction. Keywords Biodiesel Glycerol Hydrogenolysis Cu-solid base 1,2-Propanediol 1 Introduction Highly dispersed copper catalysts show good activity and selectivity in a series of reactions such as steam reforming [1\u20133] , hydrogenation [4\u20137] , ester hydrogenolysis [8] , reduction of NO x [9\u201311] , oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons [12,13] . A lot of methods were reported to prepare highly dispersed copper catalyst, of which the most common routines are impregnation and sol\u2013gel. Whereas drawbacks such as inhomogeneous agglomeration of copper species at higher content resulting in large-sized particles in impregnation and lower activities due to encapsulation of active phase in some sol\u2013gel catalysts were brought about [14] . Hydrotalcite-type compounds, also known as \u201canionic clays\u201d have attracted much attention in recent years because of their potential applications in biodiesel synthesis [15,16] , environmental protection [17,18] , catalysts [19\u201321] , catalysts supports [22] and polymer additives [23] . Their empirical formula is [M II 1\u2212 x M III x (OH) 2 ] x + [A n \u2212 x / n ] x \u2212 \u00b7 m H 2 O, where M II is a divalent metal such as Mg, Zn, Ni, Co or Cu, M III is a trivalent metal such as Al, Cr, Fe or Ga. A n \u2212 is an anion of charge n such as NO 3 \u2212 , Cl \u2212 , CO 3 2\u2212 and others, m is the molar amount of co-intercalated water. The values of x generally vary between 0.20 and 0.40 which determines the charge density of the positive layer and the anion exchange capacity [24] . The structure of these hydrotalcite-like compounds can be interpreted through comparing it to the brucite [Mg(OH) 2 ] lattice, in which magnesium cations (Mg 2+ ion) occupy the centers of hydroxide octahedra. In hydrotalcite-type compounds, partial Mg 2+ ion (M II ) is substituted by aluminum (Al 3+ ion) or other isomorphous trivalent cations, and the resulted net positive charge in cationic sheet is compensated by anions such as CO 3 2\u2212 , Cl \u2212 and OH \u2212 that present in the gallery between the brucite-like sheets [24,25] . The well-defined structure of hydrotalcite is shown in Fig. 1 . Herein, we report another method to obtain the highly dispersed copper catalyst through thermal decomposition of Cu/Mg/Al hydrotalcite-like compound. Homogenously dispersed copper catalysts with a large surface area, strong basic properties and high stability against sintering can be obtained through controlling the decomposition of the hydrotalcite-like precursors. Glycerol, as a byproduct, is produced in large amounts in the production of biodiesel via transesterification of triglycerides with methanol in the presence of basic or acidic catalysts. Finding out new outlets to make good use of this surplus glycerol can accelerate the development of biodiesel. Up to now, many efforts have been put toward the conversion of glycerol to more valuable chemicals such as propanediols [26,27] , glyceric acid [28\u201331] and glycols. Among of which, converting glycerol to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) by selective catalytic hydrogenolysis ( Scheme 1 ) has attracted much attention in recent years [32\u201338] . Over hybrid Ru/C (or Rh/SiO 2 ) + solid acids [35\u201337] and ruthenium-doped acidic heteropoly salt Cs 2.5 H 0.5 [PW 12 O 40 ] [32] catalysts, glycerol hydrogenolysis performs in dehydration of glycerol to acetol (on acid sites) and followed by acetol hydrogenation to 1,2-PDO (on the metal particles). But the conversion of glycerol was low and mainly noble metals were reported. In basic solutions, glycerol could dehydrogenate to glyceraldehydes in first, followed by dehydration to 2-hydroxyacrolein and then hydrogenate to 1,2-PDO over Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts [39\u201343] . But the added alkali such as NaOH in glycerol hydrogenolysis system caused the cleavage of C\u2013C bond. According to the mechanisms of the glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO, a solid bi-functional catalyst consisting of metal and acidic/basic sites should be capable for this reaction. Choosing solid base and/or solid acid as a component and support of metal catalyst would be an alternative of the hybrid catalysts. In our previous works, hydrotalcite, MgO, Al 2 O 3 , H-ZSM5 and H-Beta supported Pt catalysts were tested for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO. And it was found that solid base (such as hydrotalcite and MgO) supported Pt catalysts exhibited the predominant activity and higher 1,2-PDO selectivity than that of solid acids (Al 2 O 3 , H-ZSM5 and H-Beta) [44] . More recently, we found that MgO supported copper is also an efficient catalyst for glycerol hydrogenolysis with high selectivity of 1,2-PDO [45] . In present work, we want to report a homogenously dispersed Cu on solid base catalyst prepared via thermal decomposition of layered double hydroxides of Cu x Mg 6\u2212 x Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 , and this bi-functional catalyst was used in glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO. These catalysts were characterized by N 2 -adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), in-situ XRD, temperature-programmed reduction with H 2 (H 2 -TPR), dissociative N 2 O adsorption and CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD). The relation between the performance for hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO and the structure of the catalysts were discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Three hydrotalcite-like compounds with Cu:Mg:Al molar ratios of 0.4:5.6:2, 0.8:5.2:2 and 1.5:4.5:2 were prepared by coprecipitation. Required amounts of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b73H 2 O, Al(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O and Mg(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O (Shanghai Chemicals, China, AR) were dissolved in 400 mL distilled water under stirring, and this solution was referred as A, in which Al 3+ /(Cu 2+ + Mg 2+ + Al 3+ ) = 0.25 and (Cu 2+ + Mg 2+ + Al 3+ ) = 0.2 mol/L. Solution B was an aqueous of NaOH and Na 2 CO 3 , in which the concentration of Na 2 CO 3 and NaOH are 0.25 and 0.8 mol/L, respectively. Then solution A and solution B were added slowly (in around 2 h) to a 2 L breaker under vigorously stirring at room temperature, the pH was maintained at 9.5 during dripping process. The resulted suspension was transferred to a 1 L round-bottom flask and processed in circumfluence at 110 \u00b0C for 12 h, filtered off and washed thoroughly with distilled water until the pH of filtrate reached 7.0. Precipitate was then dried at 80 \u00b0C for 12 h followed by calcination at 300 \u00b0C for 4 h. Catalysts prepared according to this method were identified as Cu x Mg 6\u2212 x Al 2 O 9 -CP, x referred the amount of Cu 2+ . After hydrogen reduction at 300 \u00b0C for 1 h, these catalysts were identified as Cu x /Mg 6\u2212 x Al 2 O 9\u2212 x -CP. Mg\u2013Al hydrotalcite supported copper catalysts were also prepared by impregnation and ion-exchange, and compared as references. Mg 6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 hydrotalcite (Shanghai Chemicals, China, AR) was firstly pretreated at 60 \u00b0C in vacuum for 12 h, and impregnated in an aqueous solution of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b73H 2 O for 4 h. Then the precursor was treated in ambient air at 80 \u00b0C overnight followed by calcination at 300 \u00b0C for 4 h. Catalyst prepared in this method was identified as Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM, in which Cu:Mg:Al molar ratio was controlled as 0.4:5.6:2. Required amounts of pretreated Mg 6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 hydrotalcite were added into an aqueous solution of CuCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O, ion-exchanged in circumfluence at 50 \u00b0C for 24 h under vigorously stirring. Then the suspension was washed with distilled water thoroughly and treated in ambient air at 80 \u00b0C overnight followed by calcination at 300 \u00b0C for 4 h. Catalyst prepared in this method was identified as Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IE, in which Cu:Mg:Al molar ratio was controlled as 0.4:5.6:2. 2.2 Characterizations Element chemical analysis of Cu, Mg and Al was carried out by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP, Plasma-Spec-II spectrometer), and actual amount of these metals in prepared catalysts were confirmed and summarized in Table 1 . N 2 adsorption was measured at its normal boiling point (\u2212196 \u00b0C) using an ASAP 2010 analyzer (Micromeritics) after samples were pretreated at 250 \u00b0C for 4 h in vacuum. BET surface area and pore structure were calculated on adsorption branch. XRD patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 diffractometer in a 2 \u03b8 range of 5\u201370\u00b0 using Cu K \u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5). The particle sizes of CuO and Cu were estimated by using Scherrer equation. In-situ XRD in a 10% H 2 /Ar flow (30 mL/min) was carried out on the same system connected to an Anton-Paar high-temperature XRK assembly in which sample was mounted in a high-temperature cell, heated at 10 \u00b0C/min, and stabilized for 5 min before measurements. TG-DSC was carried out on a Netzsch STA 409 thermo-balance. Analysis was done from 30 to 530 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under nitrogen (30 mL/min). SEM images of these hydrotalcite-like samples were taken on a microscope (Leo Series VP 1430, Germany) having silicon detector equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) facility (Oxford instruments). Samples were coated with gold using sputter coating to avoid charging. Analysis was carried out at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. TEM images of reduced catalysts were recorded using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV (JEOL-2010 F). Before TEM analysis, catalysts were reduced in a stream of H 2 at 300 \u00b0C for 1 h, the reduced powders were poured into alcohol under the protection of H 2 and suspended with an ultrasonic dispersion for 10 min, and then the resulted solution was dropped on carbon film of nickel grid. TPR experiments were conducted on a quartz reactor. Samples were first loaded and pretreated at 350 \u00b0C for 1 h under N 2 flow (30 mL/min). After sample was cooled to room temperature, reduction agent (10% H 2 /N 2 mixture, 30 mL/min) was shifted; sample was heated to 350 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. Effluent gas was dried by powder KOH and consumption of hydrogen was analyzed by thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The amounts of hydrogen consumption were calibrated using known amounts of CuO. The number of surface metallic copper sites was determined by dissociative N 2 O adsorption at 50 \u00b0C using the procedure described by Van Der Grift et al. [46] . Catalysts were first reduced in the procedure described in above TPR experiment in 10% H 2 /N 2 mixture (30 mL/min) until 350 \u00b0C. The amount of hydrogen consumption in first TPR was denoted as X . And then, the catalyst bed was purged with He and cooled to 50 \u00b0C. Surface copper atoms were oxidized in a 20% N 2 O/N 2 (30 mL/min) at 50 \u00b0C for 0.5 h. Finally, samples were flushed with He to remove the oxidant and cooled to room temperature to start another TPR run. Hydrogen consumption in the second TPR was denoted as Y . The dispersion of Cu and exposed Cu surface area are calculated on the equations reported by Van Der Grift et al. [46a] , repeat: All copper atoms were reduced in the first TPR: CuO + H 2 \u2192 Cu + H 2 O, hydrogen consumption = X Surface copper atoms that were oxidized to Cu 2 O by N 2 O at 50 \u00b0C were reduced in the second TPR: Cu 2 O + H 2 \u2192 2Cu + H 2 O, hydrogen consumption = Y And the dispersion of Cu and exposed Cu surface area were calculated as: D = ( 2 \u00d7 Y / X ) \u00d7 100 % S = 2 \u00d7 Y \u00d7 N av / ( X \u00d7 M Cu \u00d7 1.4 \u00d7 10 19 ) = 1353 \u00d7 Y / X ( m 2 -Cu / g-Cu ) where N av = Avogadro's constant, M Cu = relative atomic mass (63.456 g/mol), 1.4 \u00d7 10 19 comes from that an equal abundance of an average copper surface atom area of 0.0711 nm 2 (equivalent to 1.4 \u00d7 10 19 copper atoms per square meter). The alkalinity of Cu x Mg 6\u2212 x Al 2 O 9 -CP catalysts were carried out via temperature-programmed desorption of CO 2 . Sample was first reduced at 300 \u00b0C in H 2 flow of 30 mL/min for 1 h, and then cooled to 100 \u00b0C in purified Ar, exposed to 50% CO 2 /Ar for 30 min, purged by Ar for 5 h at 100 \u00b0C in order to eliminate the physical adsorbed CO 2 . Temperature-programmed desorption was conducted by ramping to 550 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C/min and CO 2 ( m / e = 44) in effluent was detected and recorded as a function of temperature by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (OmniStarTM, GSD301, Switzerland). 2.3 Catalytic reactions The discontinuous glycerol reaction was carried out in a custom-designed 50-mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with a thermoelectric couple. Unless specifically stated, all samples were pre-reduced in a stream of H 2 at 300 \u00b0C for 1 h before they were used for catalytic hydrogenolysis of glycerol. Aqueous solution of glycerol (8.0 mL, 75 wt%) and 1.0 g reduced catalyst were added to the reactor. The autoclave was purged with H 2 to 3.0 MPa and placed in an oil bath preheated to required temperature and maintained at that temperature for a given period time under vigorously stirring with a magnetic stirrer (MAG-NEO, RV-06 M, Japan). Reactant solution was cooled to room temperature after reaction and vapor phase was collected by a gas-bag and analyzed using a TCD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, 8A) equipped with an active carbon column. Liquid phase was centrifuged to remove solid catalyst powder and analyzed using a FID gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, 14 B) equipped with a 30 m capillary column (DB-WAX 52 CB, USA). All products detected in the liquid phase and gas phase were quantified via external calibration method. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 N 2 -adsorption Nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP, Cu 0.8 Mg 5.2 Al 2 O 9 -CP and Cu 1.5 Mg 4.5 Al 2 O 9 -CP are shown in Fig. 2 . All of them are type II according to the IUPAC classification, while the location of hysteresis loop shifted to higher pressure with increasing of Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ . These results inferred that there is a large amount of slit-slapped pore channels formed because of aggregation of plate-like layers. The closure points of hysteresis loops occurred at a relative pressure of 0.48 in Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP and Cu 0.8 Mg 5.2 Al 2 O 9 -CP, suggesting that they have similar pore architecture. But the closure points of loop of Cu 1.5 Mg 4.5 Al 2 O 9 -CP increased to a relative pressure of 0.68, which inferred that the pore diameter increased. BET surface area, pore volume and average pore size of Cu x Mg 6\u2212 x Al 2 O 9 -CP samples (calculated from their adsorption isotherms) are summarized in Table 2 . It can be seen that the calculated surface area and pore volume of Cu x Mg 6\u2212 x Al 2 O 9 -CP decreased slightly with increasing Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ ratio, whereas average pore diameter increased. This could be contributed to the orderliness of crystallites decreased with increasing of copper content. 3.2 XRD XRD patterns of as-synthesized Cu x Mg 6\u2212 x Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 hydrotalcite are shown in Fig. 3 . Sharp and symmetrical reflections at 11.7\u00b0, 23.2\u00b0, 60.6\u00b0 and 61.8\u00b0 were detected in all samples, which are ascribed to diffraction of (0 0 3), (0 0 6), (1 1 0) and (1 1 3) planes in layered structure. Broad and asymmetric reflections at 34.7\u00b0, 38.8\u00b0 and 46.0\u00b0 were also appeared due to the diffraction of (1 0 2), (1 0 5) and (1 0 8) planes. All characteristic reflection peaks of a well-crystallized hydrotalcite (JCPDS 41-1428) were detected, indicating that Mg 2+ ion in brucite-like layers are replaced by Cu 2+ ion, which can be attributed to the similar ionic radii of Cu 2+ ion (0.73 \u00c5) and Mg 2+ ion (0.72 \u00c5) [47] . It can be seen that the intensity and sharpness of (1 1 0) and (1 1 3) reflections decrease with increasing Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ ratio, which means the orderliness of the crystallite decreases in the hydrotalcite with higher copper content. Chemical composition and structural characteristics of these samples are summarized in Table 1 . The detected composition of as-synthesized samples are close to that of starting mixed aqueous solutions within experimental errors, suggesting that all cations in hydrotalcite structure are approximately completely incorporated. Lattice parameters a (cation\u2013cation distance in brucite-like layer) and c = 3 c \u2032 ( c \u2032 is the thickness of one brucite-like layer and one interlayer) were calculated from the (0 0 3), (0 0 6) and (1 1 0) reflections on base of the rhombohedral symmetry of hydrotalcite and are summarized in Table 1 . The calculated a is nearly the same in all samples in this work, and this value is quite close to that of Mg\u2013Al hydrotalcite published in reference [48] , indicating Mg 2+ ion were substituted by Cu 2+ ion isomorphously in brucite layers. Because the width of brucite-like layers is 4.8 \u00c5 [49] , the interlayer distance is close to 2.9-3.0 \u00c5, which is can be calculated from c = 3 c \u2032. And these data inferred that the location of carbonate anions with their molecular planes parallels to the brucite-like layers ( Fig. 1 ). After calcination, the characteristic lamellar structure of Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al hydrotalcite still remained in Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP, whereas the framework collapsed partially in Cu 0.8 Mg 5.2 Al 2 O 9 -CP and disappeared completely in Cu 1.5 Mg 4.5 Al 2 O 9 -CP. CuO (JCPDS 48-1548) and Cu(OH) 2 (JCPDS 42-0638) were detected in calcined Cu 1.5 Mg 4.5 Al 2 O 9 -CP ( Fig. 4 ). These results mean that the lamellar structure with lower Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ is more stable. This higher thermal stability of Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP could protect the homogenous dispersion of Cu. Inter-planar spacing calculated from the (0 0 3) reflection decreased in calcined Cu 0.8 Mg 5.2 Al 2 O 9 -CP, and the range of lamellar structure becomes out-of-order after calcination, both of which can be ascribed to partially loss of carbonate and water in the gallery of hydrotalcite during calcination. Lamellar structure in Cu 1.5 Mg 4.5 Al 2 O 9 -CP collapsed completely after calcination, which lead to sintering of CuO to bigger particles. The framework collapsed in samples with higher Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ ratio might be explained by Jahn\u2013Teller distortion which brings about the poor long rang ordering [50] . Fig. 5 compared the XRD patterns of Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 , Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IE and Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM that have the same Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ /Al 3+ ratio (Cu/Mg/Al = 0.4/5.6/2). It can be found that Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 possesses perfect characteristic lamellar structure of hydrotalcite. Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IE also shows characteristic lamellar structure of hydrotalcite, but separated Cu 2+ ions (that just adsorbed on the surface of hydrotalcite) were detected at 16.3\u00b0 and 18.2\u00b0. Another unwanted phase detected at 31.2\u00b0 can be ascribed to Mg 2+ resorted on the surface of hydrotalcite and contacted with Cl \u2212 and OH \u2212 . Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM shows characteristic of hydrotalcite with most of Cu 2+ adsorbed on the surface of hydrotalcite. In other words, rarely Cu 2+ ions can insert into the structure of hydrotalcite by impregnation. These results can be summarized in that Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 prepared by coprecipitation exhibited the most perfect structure of hydrotalcite with all Cu 2+ dispersed homogenously in the matrix. But Cu/Mg/Al catalysts prepared via ion-exchange and impregnation showed poor lamellar structure and only part amount of Cu 2+ can substitute Mg 2+ . 3.3 TG-DSC Fig. 6 shows the TG-DSC profiles of as synthesized Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 . TG profile indicates two major weight losses at around 135\u2013220 \u00b0C and 330\u2013430 \u00b0C, which can be identified as the losses of adsorbed surface water bound to gallery or external surfaces and H-bound water in interlayer [51] . The overall weight loss from 30 \u00b0C to 530 \u00b0C is 36.4%, which is conformed with the formula of as-synthesize Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 and calcined Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 . 3.4 SEM analysis Fig. 7 (a)\u2013(c) shows micrographs of as-synthesized Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 , Cu 0.8 Mg 5.2 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 and Cu 1.5 Mg 4.5 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 , respectively. The images of separated particles of these samples are shown as insert. It can be clearly seen that single particle appears a shape of ball-flower sized in 1.5\u20132.5 \u03bcm. Under high-resolution, well developed layered and platelet structure could be identified, and the inter-particle space formed by accumulating of platelets became larger with increased copper content, which is consisted with those results detected in N 2 -adsorption (as shown in Table 2 ). And this inter-particle space can be considered as the source of mesopores. The average thickness of platelets in Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 , Cu 0.8 Mg 5.2 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 and Cu 1.5 Mg 4.5 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 are 20, 30 and 40 nm, respectively. Fig. 7 (d) and (e) shows micrographs of Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM and Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IE. Both of them showed indistinct morphologies of layered and platelet structure, which indicated that lamellar structure partially collapsed during catalyst preparation. 3.5 TEM analysis Fig. 8 shows TEM images of reduced Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP, Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IE and Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM that has the same Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ /Al 3+ ratio (Cu/Mg/Al = 0.4/5.6/2). Fig. 8 (a) shows the cross-section of layered platelet in reduced Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP, from which it can be found that the gallery structure of hydrotalcite. The measured d spacing in reduced Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP is 0.8 nm, which fits well with that detected in XRD. No separated Cu particle can be identified, which inferred that copper dispersed homogenously in the matrix of hydrotalcite. On the other hand, a lot of separated copper particles sized in 10\u201320 and 25\u201340 nm were detected in typical TEM images of reduced Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IE and Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM. High resolution TEM images of Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IE and Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM found that Cu particles dispersed unevenly, and the average particle size of Cu detected in HRTEM (summarized in Table 3 ) was calculated as: d TEM = \u2211 n i d i 3 \u2211 n i d i 2 where n i is the number of particles having a characteristic diameter d i . The calculated copper particle sizes in Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IE and Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM in their HRTEM images are 12.5 and 33.0 nm, respectively. 3.6 H 2 -TPR Fig. 9 illustrates H 2 -TPR profiles of calcined Cu/Mg/Al samples prepared by coprecipitation with different Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ . Only one broader peak from 150 to 260 \u00b0C was detected in Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP. This hydrogen consumption could be attributed to the reduction of Cu 2+ ions in lamellar structure of Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP. But Cu 0.8 Mg 5.2 Al 2 O 9 -CP and Cu 1.5 Mg 4.5 Al 2 O 9 -CP have two hydrogen consumption peaks, indicating that different kinds of Cu species formed. The first detected peak in Cu 0.8 Mg 5.2 Al 2 O 9 -CP (at 170 \u00b0C) can be ascribed to the reduction of highly dispersed copper oxide species that existed on outside surface of lamellar and the second peak (at 205 \u00b0C) can be assigned as reduction of Cu 2+ ions in lamellar structure. And similarly, reduction peaks in Cu 1.5 Mg 4.5 Al 2 O 9 -CP can be ascribed to reduction of Cu 2+ ions in lamellar structure (at 205 \u00b0C) and bulk copper oxide particles that were embedded in lamellar structure (at 230 \u00b0C). Fig. 4 confirmed that characteristic lamellar structure in Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP remained after calcination and no separated CuO could be detected. In this suggestion, homogenously dispersed copper could be prepared via the reduction of Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP. Fig. 10 compares the H 2 -TPR profiles of Cu/Mg/Al hydrotalcite samples prepared by different methods with same Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ /Al 3+ ratio (Cu/Mg/Al = 0.4/5.6/2). Both Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM and Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IE exhibited two hydrogen consumption peaks. The first peak at 237 \u00b0C can be ascribed to reduction of bulk copper oxide particles that were embedded in lamellar structure and the second reduction peak at 312 \u00b0C is suggested to reduction of another CuO species with a strong interaction with the surface of Mg/Al mixed oxides [45] . 3.7 In-situ XRD of the catalyst reduction process Fig. 11 shows in-situ XRD spectra of H 2 reduction process of Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP in a 10% H 2 /Ar flow (30 mL/min). The intensity of the basal reflections (0 0 3) decreased gradually and the relative angle shifted to higher position with increasing temperature, whereas the reflection (0 0 6) disappeared completely and the reflection (1 0 2) becomes broader. The peak at 43.5\u00b0 was the reflection of Al 2 O 3 that is added to sample as reference. These changes in diffraction peaks can be ascribed to the disappearance of interlayer water molecules, and consequently shrinkage of interlayer space [47] . It is quite interesting to note that lamellar structure of Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP remains stable in 10% H 2 /Ar flow below 280 \u00b0C. H 2 -TPR ( Fig. 9 ) has disclosed that Cu 2+ ions in lamellar structure of Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP could be reduced completely from 150 to 260 \u00b0C, but no copper species could be detected in this in-situ reduction process. These results also indicated that copper species reduced from the lamellar structure of Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP is homogenously dispersed in the matrix. 3.8 N 2 O adsorption Above XRD, SEM and TEM characterizations confirmed that a well-crystallized Cu x Mg 6\u2212 x Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 hydrotalcite could be synthesized when the added amount of Cu is lower ( x < 0.8), and the lamellar structure in these precursors is stable after calcination and reduction (see Fig. 8 \u2013 TEM image). Cu dispersed homogenously in the hydrotalcite precursor derived Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP lamellar, separated copper specie cannot be detected in XRD or TEM. Chemisorption of N 2 O experiments were carried out in order to identify the dispersion of copper. Fig. 12 shows the reduction profiles of Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP catalyst before and after N 2 O oxidation at 50 \u00b0C. According to the calculated hydrogen consumptions in the TPR of fresh Cu 0.4 Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 9 -CP (curve a ) and in the second TPR of freshly oxidized surface Cu 2 O phase after N 2 O oxidation (curve b ), copper dispersion and exposed copper area could be calculated by these equations reported by Van Der Grift et al. [46a] . These results are summarized in Table 3 . It can be found that the dispersion of copper in reduced Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP and Cu 0.8 /Mg 5.2 Al 2 O 8.2 -CP catalysts reached to 80.1% and 65.9%, respectively. In those catalysts with the same Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ /Al 3+ ratio (Cu/Mg/Al = 0.4/5.6/2), the calculated copper surface area in reduced Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP, Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IE and Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM are 1083, 153 and 30 m 2 /g-Cu, respectively. These values are generally in agreement with that obtained in TEM images. 3.9 CO 2 -TPD CO 2 -TPD of Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP, Cu 0.8 /Mg 5.2 Al 2 O 8.2 -CP and Cu 1.5 /Mg 4.5 Al 2 O 7.5 -CP are shown in Fig. 13 . Because the physical adsorbed CO 2 was blown at 100 \u00b0C for 5 h, mainly one desorption peak at 245 \u00b0C was detected in Cu 1.5 /Mg 4.5 Al 2 O 7.5 -CP. A shoulder peak at 360 \u00b0C appeared in Cu 0.8 /Mg 5.2 Al 2 O 8.2 -CP, and this peak increased in Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP. These results indicated that both the amount and the strength of the alkalinity sites increased with the amount of Mg. 3.10 Glycerol hydrogenolysis The activity of these catalysts for hydrogenolysis of aqueous glycerol at 180 \u00b0C and 3.0 MPa H 2 are summarized in Table 4 . Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP catalyst exhibited the best activity for hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO, conversion of glycerol and selectivity of 1,2-PDO reached 80.0% and 98.2%, respectively. While conversion of glycerol decreased to 51.8% and 29.6% over Cu 0.8 /Mg 5.2 Al 2 O 8.2 -CP and Cu 1.5 /Mg 4.5 Al 2 O 7.5 -CP, because of sintering of copper particles during catalyst preparation. In those catalysts with the same Cu 2+ /Mg 2+ /Al 3+ ratio (Cu/Mg/Al = 0.4/5.6/2), Cu\u2013Mg\u2013Al-IM showed the lowest activity for hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO with a 22.6% glycerol conversion and a 95.3% selectivity of 1,2-PDO. The activity of Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP catalyst is higher than that of solid acids supported copper catalyst [38] , and MgO supported copper and Pt catalysts [44] , and is comparable with that of hybrid Ru/C (or Rh/SiO 2 )-Amberlyst [35,37,38] and Pt/C (or Ru/C)-NaOH [41,42] . And what is more interesting is that cleavage of C\u2013C bond (catalyzed by NaOH in liquid phase) was suppressed efficiently. These results indicated that the conversion of glycerol depends strongly on the particle size of copper, smaller sized copper is extremely active and solid base can suppress the cleavage of C\u2013C bond in glycerol. Unlike to that of Pt/C and Ru/C catalyst, small amount of NaOH further increased the activity of Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP without distinct loss of the selectivity of 1,2-PDO. As it is summarized in Table 4 , conversion of glycerol is further increased to 91.2% (with a 95.5% selectivity of 1,2-PDO) when added NaOH increased to 1.0 g, and the selectivity of C\u2013C cleavage products (methanol and ethanol) only increased slightly from 0.7% to 1.9%. These results imply that increase alkali strength of solid base may further enhance its activity for glycerol hydrogenolysis. This conclusion could be illustrated in that hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO proceeds in a consecutively dehydrogenation (to glyceraldehydes), dehydration (to 2-hydroxyacrolein) and hydrogenation steps [45] . Fig. 14 shows the time course of hydrogenolysis of glycerol over Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP catalyst. Conversion of glycerol increased quickly with reaction time before 20 h, but then increased slowly to 95% at 40 h. The concentration of glycerol in aqueous solution and reaction temperature also exhibited significant impacts on the hydrogenolysis reaction. As it is summarized in Table 5 , both conversion of glycerol and yield of 1,2-PDO increase rapidly with increasing concentration of glycerol. According to the suggested reaction mechanism by Gandarias et al. [52] , this phenomenon could be attributed to that water obstructs the adsorption of glycerol and hydrogen. Raising temperature from 150 \u00b0C to 220 \u00b0C can accelerate the conversion of glycerol rapidly to >99%, and the selectivity of 1,2-PDO remains higher than 97.0%. No distinct cleavage of C\u2013C bond in glycerol occurred even at higher temperature (see Table 6 ). 4 Conclusion In summery, a highly active hydrotalcite-like catalyst containing copper and solid base was synthesized for hydrogenolysis of glycerol in this work. This kind of copper catalyst exhibited predominant activity because of the homogenously dispersion of copper species in the matrix of hydrotalcite-like solid base. And this kind of solid base supported copper catalyst is also a material full of mesopores that enhanced the accessibility of reactants. A little amount of added NaOH further increased the activity for the desired reaction without obvious cleavage of C\u2013C bond. In a word, homogenously dispersed copper on solid base could be synthesized by thermal decomposition of the layered double hydroxides and this bifunctional catalyst is efficient and attractive for glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO.

The activity and the surface component changed greatly with the impregnation step and the calcination temperature. MnO2 and CuO phase were found on the surface of the catalyst when Mn(NO3)2 was first impregnated, which can reduce the conversion of CO. As the calcination temperatures raised to > 450\u00b0C, Mn2O3 phase formed in the catalyst, which can help the formation of DME. The experimental studies were conducted on reaction temperature, space velocity, concentration of CO in the feeding gas, and the reaction pressure. The conversion of CO increased quickly with the increasing pressure, while the selectivity of DME changed little with the pressure and hydrocarbons increased with the pressure.",

        "title": "Effect of copper content on Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y catalysts for the synthesis of dimethyl ether from syngas",
        "abstract": "The activity of Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y catalysts for dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis from syngas can be affected by the content of copper in the catalyst. The appropriate ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) for catalyst activity was above 0.6, and the conversion of CO and the selectivity of DME reached 78% and 67%, respectively, under the reaction conditions of 2.0 MPa, 250 \u00b0C, 1500 h \u22121 . The results of catalyst characterization by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature- programmed desorption (TPD) showed that the excess CuO in conjunction with mixed oxide was easier reduction, much more beneficial to the activation of CO at lower temperature and higher catalytic activity for DME synthesis. Keywords Manganese Zinc Cu-based catalyst Dimethyl ether Synthesis gas 1 Introduction Dimethyl ether (DME) has attracted much more attention as a potential clean fuel for diesel engines due to its higher cetane number, lower concentration of particulates and NO x in emission [1] . Until now, DME is commercially produced via methanol dehydration, and methanol was synthesized from syngas. Synthesise of DME from syngas in a single step is more favorable in thermodynamic and economical [2,3] . A dual catalyst system consists of a methanol synthesis catalyst (mainly composed of Cu/Zn, Cu/Zn/Al, Cu/Zn/Cr, etc.) and a methanol dehydration catalyst (\u03b3-alumina or zeolites), was popularly reported for direct DME synthesis in published papers [4\u201310] . Previous works found that Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was effective for synthesis of dimethyl ether from syngas [11] , and zeolite as a dehydration component is more favorable than Al 2 O 3 in the step of methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether [12] . Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y catalysts showed a higher activity even at lower reaction temperatures [13] . Manganese in the Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y catalyst system improved the dispersion of copper via the strong interaction between manganese and copper to form Cu 1+ x Mn 2\u2212 x O 4 , and zinc improved the reducibility of Cu 1+ x Mn 2\u2212 x O 4 [14] . The \u201csynergistic effect\u201d among Cu, Mn and Zn promoted the activity and selectivity of the catalyst for the directly synthesis of DME from synthesis gas [14] . Recently, we found that the activity of the Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zelolite-Y catalyst could be optimized by adjusting the ratio of Cu/Mn/Zn in the catalyst. In this contribution, we investigated the influence of the content of copper in Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y catalysts for dimethyl ether synthesis from syngas, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of H 2 , CO and NH 3 . 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Catalysts used in this paper were prepared in a coprecipitation impregnation method as follows: an aqueous solution of Cu, Mn and Zn nitrate was dropped with Na 2 CO 3 solution at the same time into a zeolite-Y slurry of water at 60 \u00b0C, under vigorously stirring. The pH value of the slurry was controlled at 7.0\u20138.0 during the coprecipitation. After coprecipitation, the slurry was washed and filtered several times with deionized water, then dried at 160 \u00b0C and calcined in air at 450 \u00b0C for 4 h. The mole ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) in Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y catalysts changed from 0.4 to 0.7, while the mole ratio of Mn/Zn is 2 and the total content of metals is is constant in zeolite. 2.2 Catalytic reaction The catalytic reaction was carried out in high-pressure micro-reactor (MCRS8400, China). Catalyst (20\u201340 mesh, 2 ml, about 1.6 g) was charged into a stainless steel fixed-bed reactor, reduced in H 2 at 270 \u00b0C for 3 h under 0.1 MPa. After cooled to 160 \u00b0C, the reactant gases, controlled by the mass flow controllers (Brook 5850E, USA) with the mole ratio of H 2 /CO = 3/2, were purged to 2.0 MPa. Typical reaction conditions were 250 \u00b0C, 2.0 MPa, and 1500 h \u22121 . The products in effluent were separated by a Propapak-Q column and analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph with a thermal detector (HP5890, series II, USA). All experimental date were obtained under steady-state conditions that were usually maintained for 8 h. 2.3 Characterizations 2.3.1 X-ray powder diffraction analysis Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on an automated power X-ray diffractometer (Rigku-D/max-2550/PC, Japan), using Cu K\u03b1 radiation, at 40 kV and 300 mA. 2.3.2 Temperature-programmed reduction Temperature-programmed reduction with H 2 (H 2 \u2013TPR) experiments was performed on a catalyst characterization system (AMI-200, USA), which equipped with an on-line mass spectrometer. Catalyst (10 mg) was charged in a U-typed quartz cell, pretreated in argon at 400 \u00b0C for 1 h, then reduced under a 10% H 2 /Ar stream (40 ml/min) from 50 to 700 \u00b0C with a ramp of 10 \u00b0C/min. The amount of H 2 ( m / e = 2) in effluent was analyzed by an on-line mass spectrum, and recorded as a function of temperature. 2.3.3 Temperature-programmed desorption of H 2 , CO and NH 3 Temperature-programmed desorption of H 2 , CO and NH 3 were carried out in the same equipment mentioned above in following steps: catalyst (100 mg) was placed in a quartz reactor and first reduced at 270 \u00b0C in H 2 flow of 30 ml/min for 1 h, then purged by argon at 400 \u00b0C for 1 h; the absorbed material (NH 3 , CO or H 2 ) was introduced into the sample with a flow of 20 ml/min for 0.5 h at 50 \u00b0C, then purged by argon steam under the flow of 40 ml/min until the mass spectrum signal reached a constant level. The temperature of rector was programmed to rise with ramp of 10 \u00b0C /min, and the amount of desorbed material in effluent was measured by a mass spectrum (NH 3 : m / e = 17 and 14, CO: m / e = 28 and 16, H 2 : m / e = 2) and recorded as a function of temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of the content of copper on catalytic performance The catalytic performances of the Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y catalyst with different content of copper for DME synthesis are summarized in Table 1 . It can be found that the selectivity of DME remained almost constant with the increased ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn), while the conversion of CO increased from 65.6% to 78.7% with the ratio increased from 0.4 to 0.6, and then changed slightly when the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) up to 0.7. That is, the activity of catalysts for direct synthesis DME depended on the content of copper in a certain extent. 3.2 Characterization of catalysts 3.2.1 XRD analyses The XRD patterns of Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y catalysts with the different ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) are shown in Fig. 1 . In Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) = 0.4 catalyst, the broad diffraction lines were ascribed to Cu 1+ x Mn 2\u2212 x O 4 (0 < x < 0.5). As the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) was up to 0.5, ZnMn 2 O 4 was detected together with a predominant CuO, while the diffraction lines of Cu 1+ x Mn 2\u2212 x O 4 phase became minor. In the Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) = 0.4 catalyst, the calculated atom ratio of Cu/Mn is 1, which favors the formation of Cu 1.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 . Some amount of Zn might enter Cu 1.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 lattice, while its structural changed slightly. In Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) = 0.5 catalyst, the calculated atom ratio of Cu/Mn is 1.5, so copper is excess for the formation of Cu 1.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 , then a segregation of CuO as an independent phase is expected. Mn and Zn with a smaller atom size would enter the CuO lattice, as ZnMn 2 O 4 was detected. Therefore, the structure of the catalysts was changed when the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) was up to 0.5. Similar XRD spectrum of the catalysts (Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) = 0.6, 0.7) was detected, but the intensity of the species phases changed. By correlating the X-ray diffraction data with their catalytic activity, we think that those samples with excess CuO phases in conjunction with the mixed oxide (Cu 1+ x Mn 2\u2212 x O 4 (0 < x < 0.5) and ZnMn 2 O 4 ) are more active than the single mixed oxide phases. Similar observation is also found from the H 2 \u2013TPR. 3.2.2 Temperature-programmed reduction Fig. 2 shows the H 2 \u2013TPR profiles of Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y catalysts with different ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn). A main reduction peak centered at 210 \u00b0C (namely \u03b3) with a minor shoulder peak at 167 \u00b0C (namely \u03b1), appears on Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) = 0.4 catalyst. According to the XRD results, the \u03b3 peak can be attributed to the reduction of copper\u2013manganese oxide (Cu 1+ x Mn 2\u2212 x O 4 (0 < x < 0.5)). The \u03b1 peak is the reduction of the amorphous CuO, which cannot be detected by XRD [15,16] . As the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) increased to 0.5, a new reduction peak at 197 \u00b0C (namely \u03b2) appeared. The intensity of \u03b2 peak increased with the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn), while the intensity of \u03b3 peak decreases, which agrees with the changes of CuO and Cu 1+ x Mn 2\u2212 x O 4 phases in XRD. The \u03b2 peak can be assigned to reduction of the excess CuO, and the \u03b3 peak can be assigned to reduction of Cu 1+ x Mn 2\u2212 x O 4 . The shoulder peak (\u03b1) is the reduction of the amorphous CuO species, because its intensity increases slightly with the increased ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn). Considering the fact that the catalysts with \u03b2 reducing peak exhibited higher activity, we think that the CuO (corresponding to \u03b2 peak) is beneficial to direct synthesis of DME from syngas. 3.2.3 Temperature-programmed desorption of H 2 , CO and NH 3 The TPD profiles of H 2 and CO absorbed on catalysts with different ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. Only one H 2 desorption peak at 145 \u00b0C appears on all catalysts, and the intensity of H 2 desorption peak change slightly with the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn). It means that the strength and number of the adsorbed H 2 sites on the surfaces of these catalysts cannot be affected by the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn). CO\u2013TPD profiles of catalysts (see Fig. 4 ) show that the desorption temperature of CO shifts from 145 to 135 \u00b0C with the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) increasing from 0.4 to 0.6. The intensity of CO desorption peak increases gradually with the increased ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn), and then maintained almost constant as the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) increases from 0.6 to 0.7. It means that the capability of absorbed CO depends on the content of copper in the catalysts. The NH 3 \u2013TPD (seen Fig. 5 ) shows that the catalysts with the different ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) have the similar area of desorption peak of NH 3 at about 270 \u00b0C. It indicates that the number and strength of the acid sites on the catalysts are independent on the content of copper. The acidity of the catalysts for dimethyl ether synthesis comes from the support, such as zeolite in the Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/zeolite-Y. In the preparation process, some amount of metallic ions might be exchanged into the inner pore, and/or supercage of zeolite. Cu 2+ can be precipitated easily compared with Mn 2+ and Zn 2+ , and the following precipitation of manganese and/or zinc covered mainly on the outer surface of zeolite. We think that the content of copper hardly effects on the acidity of the catalysts when the total content of metal is constant. It has been confirmed that the direct synthesis of dimethyl ether from syngas proceeded via the synthesis of methanol on metallic components and a consecutive dehydration of methanol on the acidic support [4,17] . So the activity of the catalysts depends both on the capability of carbon monoxide hydrogenation and the capability of dehydration. The TPD results show that the activity of dehydration and the capability of chemisorption of H 2 are similar in these catalysts, but the strength of chemisorption of CO decreases slightly and the number of the sites increases with the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) increasing. Published papers [18\u201321] showed that CO is mainly adsorbed on the dispersed copper, the strength of CO adsorbed on Cu + is stronger than on Cu 0 and the appropriate ratio of Cu 0 /Cu + is beneficial to enhance the activity of CO hydrogenation. According to the H 2 \u2013TPR and XRD results, we think that the copper in Cu 1+ x Mn 2\u2212 x O 4 phase in the catalyst with a Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) = 0.4 ratio possesses more positive charges than that of excess CuO phase combined with the mixed oxide in the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) up to 0.5 catalyst after reduction. On this assumption, the strength of CO adsorbed decreases with the increased ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn). The higher activity of the catalysts with a Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) ratio up to 0.6, may be due to the appropriate ratio of Cu 0 /Cu + . Therefore, the effect of the Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) ratio on the catalytic activity is their chemisorption capability of CO, which depends strongly on the content of copper and the interaction within copper, manganese and zinc. 4 Conclusions As a conclusion, we think that increasing copper content in Cu\u2013Mn\u2013Zn/Y catalyst is conducive to enhance its activity for direct synthesis of DME from CO hydrogenation. Catalyst with a Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) ratio up to 0.6 exhibits the best performance. XRD results showed that excess CuO phases with the minor mixed oxide phases present in the catalysts when the ratio of Cu/(Cu + Mn + Zn) up to 0.6. H 2 \u2013TPR results showed that the excess CuO phases in conjunction with mixed oxide are easily reduced than the CuO in Cu 1+ x Mn 2\u2212 x O 4 . TPD of H 2 , CO and NH 3 adsorption results show that the content of copper mainly affects the adsorption of CO on catalyst surface, and the copper reduced from the excess CuO phases is beneficial to the activation of CO at lower temperature. These results indicate that the catalysts with the excess CuO phases in conjunction with mixed oxide are more active than the mixed oxide phases.

The catalyst is efficient for Heck arylation of aryl iodides with alkene. The effects of reaction temperature and Pd2+ content on catalytic properties have also been studied. Pd2+ has been found to improve the catalytic performance, reducing the reaction temperature (70\u00b0C) and the induction period. It provides an economic way to synthesize unsymmetrical trans-stilbenes.",

Catalytic activities of Co based catalysts depended greatly on interaction strength between metal and support. Co/\u03b3-Al2O3 and Co/SiO2 catalysts showed poor catalytic activity because the interaction between Co and support was either too strong or too weak. Alternatively, Co/\u03b1-Al2O3 catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity since interaction between Co and \u03b1-Al2O3 was suitable. Co loading on Co/\u03b1-Al2O3 catalysts had great effect on catalytic activity. Low Co loading Co/\u03b1-Al2O3 catalysts made phase transfer from Co0 to CoAl2O4 easy and thus deactivated the catalyst. However, too high Co loading Co/\u03b1-Al2O3 catalysts led to carbon deposition during reaction and large particles of Co metal were the active centers of carbon deposition.",

The catalyst amount and reaction time were important factors affecting the product yield. The \u03b3-butyrolactone could be converted to the product quantitatively under certain reaction conditions, but it was not suitable for industrial application because of its environmental pollution. Thus, some polymer resins were chosen to replace AlCl3 to make this process much more friendly to the environment. Nafion-H was the best among the polymer resins in terms of both the product selectivity and yield. The yield of 4-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)butyric acid increased with the increase of reaction temperature and reached the maximum value of 84.5% at 200\u00b0C, while the selectivity was about 90%. Nafion-H could be reused after simply washing and drying, but its activity decreased by 4-5% with each use. A reaction mechanism under the Nafion-H catalysis was proposed, in which the activation of \u03b3-butyrolactone was the key step.",

Several factors such as impregnation liquid concentration, ion-exchange time, and solvent used in the preparation were examined. Optimal preparation conditions for the ZnCl2-modified ion exchange resin included the use of deionized water as solvent, 0.15% concentration (mass fraction) of the ZnCl2 solution, and ion-exchange time of 30 h. The H+ exchange capacity of the ZnCl2-modified ion exchange resin was investigated by acid-base titration. UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption were used to characterize the catalyst. Gas chromatography was used to determine the catalyst activity for the esterification of ethanol and acetic acid under microwave. The acid strength and catalytic activity of the ion exchange resin were improved after being modified by ZnCl2, and the H+ exchange capacity of the modified catalyst is about 1.5 times that of the original one. Moreover, the skeleton structure of the modified resin has not changed. Only a small blue shift and reduction of the absorption intensity can be observed on the corresponding UV absorption peak, and the BET surface area decreases slightly. The ZnCl2-modified catalyst showed a higher reactivity in the water system and a better repeatability as compared to the unmodified one.",

        "abstract": "The bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of biomass cannot be used effectively as engine fuel because of its high corrosiveness and instability mainly due to substantial amounts of organic acids and reactive aldehydes. In this paper a treatment of acids and aldehydes in the bio-oil was focused on. A novel upgrading method named one-step hydrogenation - esterification (OHE) was established to convert acids and aldehydes to stable and combustible components. Acetaldehyde (butyl aldehyde) and acetic acid were chosen as model compounds for the OHE reaction over platinum catalysts that acidic supports such as HZSM-5 or amorphous aluminum silicate were adopted. The catalysts were bifunctional, which means they have properties of hydrogenation and esterification. Experiments showed this, and it was a feasible route to convert these main unstable components of bio-oil to esters through this simple and effective OHE reaction. The catalysts with high surface area, large pore size distribution, small metal particles,and strong acid sites may be beneficial for the OHE reaction. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "The effect of manganese on the dispersion, reduction behavior and active states of surfaces of \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 supported copper catalysts was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and XPS technologies. The relationship between the area of metallic copper and the activity of dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis from CO/H 2 was also investigated. The catalytic activity over Cu-MnO x /\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalyst for CO hydrogenation is higher than that of Cu/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 . The adding of manganese increases the dispersion of the supported copper oxide. For the CuO/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, there are two reducible copper oxide species; \u03b1- and \u03b2-peaks are attributed to the reduction of highly dispersed copper oxide species and bulk CuO species, respectively. For the CuO-MnO x /\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, four reduction peaks are observed. The \u03b1-peak is attributed to the reduction of high dispersed copper oxide species; \u03b2-peak is ascribed to the reduction of bulk CuO; \u03b3-peak is ascribed to the high-dispersed CuO interacting with Mn; and \u03b4-peak is attributed to the reduction of the manganese oxide interacting with copper oxide. XPS results showed that Cu + mostly existed on the working surface of the Cu-Mn/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Cu promoted the catalytic activity with positive charge, which was formed by means of long path exchange function between Cu\ue5f8O\ue5f8Mn. These results indicate that there are synergistic interactions between the copper and manganese oxide, which are responsible for the high activity of CO hydrogenation.",

        "title": "Characterization and investigation on the difference of hydrothermal stability for ordered mesoporous aluminosilicate sieves",
        "abstract": "Ordered hexagonal mesoporous aluminosilicates molecular sieves, designated as MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2, have been synthesized via re-crystallization of mesoporous SBA-15 within the diluted solution of aluminosilicate sol\u2013gel, glycerol, and both of them, respectively. The three materials have been characterized by XRD, N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption, FT-IR, FE-SEM, 27 Al MAS NMR and 29 Si MAS NMR, and the corresponding hydrothermal stability of these three sieves is in the order of MSAMS-2 > MSAMS-2G \u226b MSAMS-2A. The hydrothermal stability difference between MSAMS-2 and MSAMS-2G might be attributed to the synergistic effect of the higher condensation of silanol groups and insertion of all non-framework Al atoms into the framework of MSAMS-2. The hydrothermal stability of MSAMS-2G is higher than that of MSAMS-2A, which is likely because the high viscosity of glycerol will be in favor of the silanol groups interacting with zeolite-like subunits and moreover glycerol can act as a stabilizing guest molecule. Keywords Ordered mesoporous sieves Synthesis Hydrothermal stability Characterization 1 Introduction Ordered mesoporous molecular sieves (OMMSs) with high surface area, well-defined and tunable pore diameters of 2\u201350 nm have attracted much attention for potential applications as versatile catalysts and catalysts supports, template, adsorption and separation materials [1\u20139] . However, compared with microporous aluminosilicate zeolites, the acidity and hydrothermal stability of OMMSs are relatively low, which severely limit them practical applications as catalytic support and/or catalysts in petroleum refining and fine chemical synthesis [1,2,6\u20139] . In general, both weak acidity and low hydrothermal stability of OMMSs could be attributed to the amorphous nature of their mesoporous pore wall. Therefore, in the past decade years, many efforts have been focused on improving both the hydrothermal stability and the acidity of OMMSs [9\u201319] . One might expect to improve both the stability and acidity of these materials if zeolite-like order could be introduced into the mesopore walls. It is well-documented that the amorphous walls of the mesostructure could indeed be converted to a partially zeolitic product. For instance, van Bekkum et al. reported that the walls of Al-HMS and Al-MCM-41 could be transformed into partially zeolitic structures by ion-exchanged them with a microporous zeolites structure template such as TPA + [10] . Hydrothermally stable mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves have been synthesized via assembly of zeolite seeds of ZSM-5, BEA, TS-1 and FAU by use of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) or HO(CH 2 CH 2 O) 20 (CH 2 CH(CH 3 )O) 70 (CH 2 CH 2 O) 20 H (P123) as a structure-directing agent [11\u201317] . A coated route was used to synthesis of ultrastable mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves through ion-exchanged Al-SBA-15 and Al-MCF with ZSM-5 and FAU seeds, respectively [18,19] . More recently, SBA-16 and MCM-41 type mesoporous aluminosilicates with high hydrothermal stability have been synthesized by the use of the dissolution of zeolite Na-A [20,21] and the dissolved ZSM-5 [22] zeolite as a single-source of silicon and aluminum. In this paper, three well-ordered hexagonal mesoporous aluminosilicates molecular sieves, designated as MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2, have been successfully synthesized via re-crystallization of SBA-15 within the diluted solution of aluminosilicate sol\u2013gel, glycerol, and both of them, respectively. XRD results clearly exhibit that all the three ordered mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves exhibit higher hydrothermal stability than that of SBA-15, and the corresponding hydrothermal stability of them is in the order of MSAMS-2 > MSAMS-2G \u226b MSAMS-2A. Furthermore, the difference of hydrothermal stability among the three ordered mesoporous Aluminosilicate molecular sieves was investigated and discussed in detail via the use of FT-IR, FE-SEM, 27 Al and 29 Si MAS NMR characterization. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of materials 2.1.1 Synthesis of SBA-15 Hexagonal ordered mesoporous SBA-15 molecular sieve was synthesized by using triblock copolymer HO(CH 2 CH 2 O) 20 (CH 2 CH(CH 3 )O) 70 (CH 2 CH 2 O) 20 H (Pluronic P123, Aldrich) as a structure-directing agent, and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica source. The chemical composition of the reaction mixture was 1 mol P123: 60 mol TEOS: 390 mol HCl: 8536 mol H 2 O. Hydrolysis and crystallization temperature is 38 \u00b0C and 96 \u00b0C, and the corresponding time is 20 and 24 h, respectively. Then, the reaction products were filtered, washed and dried at 45 \u00b0C for 48 h. Finally, the samples were calcined at 550 \u00b0C in air for 8 h. 2.1.2 Preparation of diluted solution of aluminosilicate sol\u2013gel Tetrapropylammonium bromide (7.2 g) (27.0 mmol TPA + ) was dissolved in 28.8 ml of deionized water to form a solution. Next to, 13.5 g of TEOS (64.8 mmol), 0.18\u20130.93 g of sodium aluminate (41.1wt% Al 2 O 3 and 25.9 wt% Na 2 O) and 75 ml of H 2 O (4166.7 mmol) were added into the solution. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was stirred at 25 \u00b0C overnight. Finally, the reaction product was diluted with denionized water to yield 450 ml of aluminosilicate sol\u2013gel solution. 2.1.3 Synthesis of MSAMS-2A Calcined SBA-15 (5 g) was added into the diluted solution of aluminosilicate sol\u2013gel (150 ml) under vigorous stirring at room temperature (RT) for 2 h. Next to, the reaction product was transferred into Teflon-lined stainless autoclaves and crystallized at 110\u2013130 \u00b0C for 12\u201336 h. After that, followed by filtered, washed and dried at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. At last, the product was calcined at 550 \u00b0C in air for 8 h. 2.1.4 Synthesis of MSAMS-2G Calcined SBA-15 (5 g) was added into the diluted solution of aluminosilicate sol\u2013gel (150 ml) under vigorous stirring at RT for 2 h. Subsequently, the reaction product was filtered, washed and dried at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. After that, the product was suspended in 12.5 ml of glycerol and crystallized at 130\u2013150 \u00b0C for 48 h. Finally, the product was filtered, washed, dried, and calcined at 550 \u00b0C in air for 8 h. 2.1.5 Synthesis of MSAMS-2 Calcined SBA-15 (5 g) was added into the diluted solution of aluminosilicate sol\u2013gel (150 ml) under vigorous stirring at RT for 2 h. After that, the reaction product was transferred into Teflon-lined stainless autoclaves and crystallized at 110\u2013130 \u00b0C for 12\u201336 h, followed by filtration, washed and dried at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. Subsequently, the product was suspended in 12.5 ml of glycerol and crystallized at 130\u2013150 \u00b0C for 48 h. Finally, the product was filtered, washed, dried, and calcined at 550 \u00b0C in air for 8 h. For comparison purposes, Al-SBA-15 was synthesized according to the procedure reported in Ref. [23] . 2.2 Characterization of materials Powder XRD patterns were performed on a Rigaku D/max 2550 PC diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation, operating at 40 kV and 300 mA. BET surface area and N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms were carried out on an Omnisorp - 100CX apparatus at \u2212196 \u00b0C. All samples were degassed at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h prior to analysis. The BET specific surface area was calculated from adsorption data in the relative pressure range from 0.05 to 0.25. The pore size distribution (PSD) was calculated by employing an algorithm based on the concept of Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda and using the adsorption branch data of the N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms. TEM images were obtained on a JEM-2010 HR transmission electron microscope, operating with an accelerate voltage of 200 kV. The 27 Al and 29 Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DSX 300 spectrometer with a spinning frequency of 12 kHz and 4 kHz, respectively. FT-IR spectra of the samples in the form of KBr pellets were recorded by using a Nicolet 560 IR spectrometer. 2.3 Hydrothermal stability tests The hydrothermal stability of the synthesized samples was investigated by mixing ca. 0.5 g of the calcined sample with 50 g of deionised water and heating in a closed bottle at 100 \u00b0C under static conditions for different time periods. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 illustrates N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and the corresponding XRD patterns of SBA-15, MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2. According to the IUPAC classification, the N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2 are founded to be of type IV, which are similar to that of SBA-15. Moreover, a clear type-H 1 hysteresis loop is observed for each of them. These results indicate that MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2 display the typical behavior of mesoporous materials ( Fig. 1 A). The relative pressure ( P / P 0 ) position of the inflection point is related to a diameter in the mesopore range, and the sharpness of these steps indicates the uniformity of the pore size [24,25] . As shown in Fig. 1 A, the absorption branches of the isotherms for MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2 show the inflection point at lower relative pressure value than that of SBA-15, indicating that the mean pore size of them is smaller than that of SBA-15. A well resolved pattern with a prominent peak (1 0 0) and two weak peaks (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) are detected in the 2 \u03b8 region of 0.5\u20132\u00b0 for all the four samples, which is an indication of good long-range hexagonal ordering. As can be seen by comparing with SBA-15 ( Fig. 1 B), scarcely any changes in the basal spacing (d 1 0 0 ) and the diffraction intensity of (1 0 0) reflection for MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2 are observed, indicating that the unit cell dimensions of them are the same as that of SBA-15. On the basis of the characterization results from N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption and XRD, the smaller pore size along with the unchanging unit cell dimension is an indication of thicker pore wall for MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2. The thicker pore wall is expected to provide significantly improved hydrothermal stability to them [8] , which might be attributed to the five-membered ring subunits overgrow within the channels of SBA-15 with the aid of microporous zeolites structure template TPA + . Fig. 2 provides the XRD patterns of SBA-15, MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2 before and after hydrothermal stability tests. As shown in Fig. 2 A, SBA-15 has maintained a well-ordered hexagonal symmetry mesostructure ( p6mm ) no more than 120 h, which is in excellent agreement with the previous reports [8,26] . MSAMS-2A retains XRD order after treated with 100 \u00b0C water over 120 h, but the mesostructure was almost destroyed after this treatment for 360 h ( Fig. 2 B). XRD results clearly exhibit that MSAMS-2G retains ordered mesostructure after treated with 100 \u00b0C water for 360 h. However, with the treatment time increasing to 434 h, the mesostructure of MSAMS-2G was completely lost ( Fig. 2 C). As for MSAMS-2, an intense (1 0 0) diffraction peak and two well resolved higher order (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) peaks are still observed in spite of the treatment time increasing to 434 h ( Fig. 2 D). Furthermore, there were no significant changes in the basal spacing (d 1 0 0 ), the linewidths and (1 0 0) reflection diffraction intensity of MSAMS-2 resulted from the hydrothermal stability treatment. However, it is noted that the ratio of the diffraction intensity of (200) to (110) decreases with the treatment time increasing, suggesting that the corresponding pore wall thickness becomes thinner [27\u201331] . The N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and corresponding BJH pore size distribution curves for MSAMS-2 before and after hydrothermal stability tests are displayed in Fig. 3 . All the samples after hydrothermal treatment still exhibit type IV isotherms with H 1 hysteresis loops ( Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, a narrow pore size distribution is observed for each of them ( Fig. 3 B). Combining the results of XRD characterization which show that MSAMS-2 retains XRD order, it can be concluded that the mesoporous channels of MSAMS-2 with two-dimensional hexagonally ordered arrays were perfectly maintained after these hydrothermal treatments. Table 1 gives the corresponding physicochemical properties of MSAMS-2 and compares them with those for SBA-15, MSAMS-2A and MSAMS-2G under equivalent hydrothermal treatment conditions. It is very interesting to note that the surface area and mesoporous volume of MSAMS-2 increase slightly even after treated with 100 \u00b0C water for 434 h, while the surface area and total pore volume of SBA-15, MSAMS-2A and MSAMS-2G reduce with the hydrothermal treatment time increasing. In light of these results, the hydrothermal stability of the four samples is in the order of MSAMS-2 > MSAMS-2G \u226b MSAMS-2A > SBA-15. In following of this paper, other characterization methods are used to investigate the difference of hydrothermal stability for SBA-15, MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2 in detail. The band centered in the 550\u2013600 cm \u22121 region is well-expressed in the spectra of MSAMS-2, MSAMS-2A and MSAMS-2G but not for the SBA-15 ( Fig. 4 ), which was assigned to characteristic vibration of five-membered ring subunits [32\u201334] . The band presence indicates that zeolite-like subunits comprised of AlO 4 and SiO 4 tetrahedra were formed within the framework of these ordered mesoporous materials, which should play an important role in improving their hydrothermal stability [12] . A distinct IR vibration centered at 960 cm \u22121 was detected for the four samples, which is the characteristic of non-condensed silanol groups [35,36] . However, the intensity of the band for MSAMS-2, MSAMS-2A and MSAMS-2G is much weaker than that of SBA-15, suggesting that the condensation degree of silanol groups of the three samples was far higher than that of SBA-15, as further confirmed by 29 Si NMR characterization result in the following of the paper. Fig. 5 illustrates 27 Al MAS NMR spectra of MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2. It is clearly that only a single resonance centered near 53 ppm is detected for the 27 Al MAS NMR spectrum of MSAMS-2, which has been attributed to tetrahedral aluminum center (framework Al) and indicated that all the Al atoms were incorporated into the mesoporous framework of MSAMS-2. An intense along with a weak resonance, centered near 53 and 0 ppm, are observed for the 27 Al MAS NMR spectra of MSAMS-2A and MSAMS-2G, and the latter resonance is characteristic of octahedrally coordinated Al (non-framework Al, \u03b4 = 0 ppm) [37,38] . The 27 Al NMR results indicate that non-framework Al atoms can be inserted into the framework of MSAMS-2 by re-crystallization both within the diluted solution of aluminosilicate sol\u2013gel and glycerol. This is likely because the octahedrally coordinated Al atoms interact with the silanol groups (these are the weak links in SBA-15 framework and are known to occur at defect sites), which not only further reduces the concentration of silanol groups but acts to heal defect sites in the structure of SBA-15 [39] , thus stabilizing the structure of MSAMS-2. The result of 27 Al MAS NMR provides a conceivable confirmation to prove that hydrothermal stability of MSAMS-2 is higher than that of MSAMS-2A and MSAMS-2G. Normally, surfactant-containing silica mesostructure, whether assembled from ionic or neutral surfactants, exhibits Q 4 /Q 3 ratios that are less than 2.0, and their calcined derivatives typically have values near 3.0 [40\u201342] . For example, the Q 4 /Q 3 ratio of SBA-15 containing surfactant P123 is 1.9 [26] . The 29 Si MAS NMR spectra of MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2 are shown in Fig. 6 . It is clearly that only a primary resonance at \u03b4 = \u2212110 ppm and a weak peak at \u03b4 = \u2212100 ppm correspond to Si(SiO) 4 (fully cross-linked Q 4 silica unit) and (HO)Si(SiO) 3 (incompletely cross-linked Q 3 silica unit), respectively, are detected for the three samples. As deduced from spectra, the ratio of Q 4 /Q 3 of MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2 is 5.9, 6.3 and 7.2, respectively, which may be due to multistage and high temperature re-crystallization [26,31,43] . It is well-documented that both the insertion of non-framework Al atoms into the framework which act to heal defect sites in the structure of mesoporous materials and the high degree of condensation silanol groups are responsible for significant improving their hydrothermal stability [26,37,41,43,44] . FE-SEM images of SBA-15, MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2 are displayed in Fig. 7 . In general, the morphologies of MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2 are similar to those of parent SBA-15. However, some isolated sphere particles comprised of zeolite-like subunits with diameter from several tens to 200 nm arisen from the diluted solution of aluminosilicates sol\u2013gel are still observed for MSAMS-2A and MSAMS-2G but not for MSAMS-2. As can be seen by comparing Fig. 7 b and c, it is noticeable that the number of isolated sphere particles of MSAMS-2G is far less than that of MSAMS-2A. The most probable explanation for the difference between MSAMS-2A and MSAMS-2G observed here is that glycerol is of benefit to the interaction between the isolated sphere particles and the silanol groups of SBA-15, which is well consistent with the previous reports that various silicate structures are formed during aging due to the interaction of glycerol with silicate species [45,46] . Moreover, the less sphere particles also indicates that the condensation degree of silanol groups for MSAMS-2G is higher than that of MSAMS-2A, as confirmed by 29 Si MAS NMR. Therefore, we postulate that the difference of hydrothermal stability between MSAMS-2A and MSAMS-2G is likely because the high viscosity of glycerol will be in favor of the silanol groups interacting with zeolite-like subunits and moreover glycerol can act as a stabilizing guest molecule. 4 Conclusions In summary, well-ordered hexagonal mesoporous aluminosilicates molecular sieves, designated as MSAMS-2A, MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2, have been successfully synthesized via re-crystallization of SBA-15 within the diluted solution of aluminosilicates sol\u2013gel, glycerol, or both of them. All the three sieves retain XRD order after treated with 100 \u00b0C water over 120 h, and the hydrothermal stability of them is in the order of MSAMS-2 > MSAMS-2G \u226b MSAMS-2A > SBA-15. Compared with SBA-15, the formation five-membered ring subunits within MSAMS-2A taken with thicker pore wall might be responsible for the significant improvement of it hydrothermal stability. The hydrothermal stability difference between MSAMS-2G and MSAMS-2A is likely because the high viscosity of glycerol will be in favor of the silanol groups interacting with zeolite-like subunits and moreover glycerol can act as a stabilizing guest molecule. The hydrothermal stability of MSAMS-2 is higher than that of MSAMS-2G., which might be attributed to the synergistic effect of the higher condensation of silanol groups and insertion of all non-framework Al atoms into the framework of MSAMS-2.

        "abstract": "A series of Pt/C catalysts with different Pt particle size ranged from 1.2 to 26.5 nm were prepared and used for the oxidation of glycerol in a base-free aqueous solution. The morphologies and the dispersion of Pt were characterized by CO adsorption, TEM and XRD. It was found that the dispersion of Pt depends strongly on the surface properties of the support, the amount of reducing agent and preparation temperature. Though bigger sized Pt particles (>10 nm) were less active, smaller sized ones (<6 nm) exhibited higher glycerol conversion, stable selectivity and good recycled activity. Keywords Glycerol Glyceric acid Oxidation Platinum catalysts Base-free 1 Introduction Glycerol (propane 1,2,3-triol) produced in large amounts during the trans-esterification of fatty acids into biodiesel appears to be a potentially valuable building block molecule [1] . Glycerol oxidation is a complex reaction that can produce a large number of products, and many of them are useful intermediates or valuable fine chemicals, e.g. glyceric acid and dihydroxyacetone [2] . An increasing number of studies dealing with the chemoselective oxidation of glycerol in liquid phase were reported followed the pioneer investigations of Gallezot et al. [3\u20135] and Kimura et al. [6,7] . It was found that the activities of Pd and Pt depend strongly on the basicity of the reaction medium and the main reaction products are non-desired C 1 by-products (such as CO 2 , HCHO and HCOOH) in a base-free condition [8,9] . In a stronger basic solution (NaOH/glycerol = 4), monometallic Pt/C catalysts deactivate continuously during the reaction [8] . Recently, Luque et al. reported that the oxidation of glycerol on supported Pd catalyst in base-free conditions with hydrogen peroxide (30%, v/v) under microwave irradiation produced mainly glycolic acid and oxalic acid [10] . Au-based catalysts were also investigated under pressurized pure oxygen (3\u20136 bar) and strong basicity conditions (NaOH/glycerol > 1) [9,11,12] . In an aqueous solution of over stoichiometric NaOH (NaOH/glycerol = 4), Porta and Prati found that the activity of Au decreased with the enlarged particle size from 2 to 16 nm. Larger sized Au (>20 nm) showed constant selectivity from the beginning to the end of the reaction [13,14] , but well-dispersed Au with a mean diameter centered at 6 nm cannot maintain the initial selectivity [13] and Au is totally inactive without the help of NaOH. In a basic solution, mainly sodium glycerate formed and the reaction mixture needs additional neutralization and acidification in order to get the free glycerol acid. These procedures are environmentally unfriendly and would mask the real activity and product distribution. The intrinsic catalytic reaction mechanism of glycerol oxidation would also be masked by the added NaOH because the stability of the reaction intermediates depends on the concentration of added base [15] . At the same time, Ketchie et al. found that NaOH in the reaction mixture would enhance the cleavage of the C\u2013C bond in glycerol [16] . In published works, a systematic study of the effect of the particle size of Pt on the selective oxidation of glycerol in a base-free aqueous solution has seldom been reported. In this work we want to provide a better understanding of the effect of Pt particle size on glycerol oxidation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation and characterizations A commercial active carbon (Tangshan Jianxin Active Carbon Co., Ltd.) was firstly pretreated with a solution of either 68% HNO 3 or 30% H 2 O 2 at 50 \u00b0C for 5 h, washed with distilled water until the pH reached 6.0\u20136.5. Then the suspension was filtered off and dried overnight at 60 \u00b0C in vacuum. The pretreated carbons were denoted as HNO 3 -C and H 2 O 2 -C. Secondly, a solution of platinum chloride was added dropwise to a stirring suspension of 5.0 g H 2 O 2 -C support at 50 \u00b0C and reduced with 4.0 cm 3 formaldehyde (37 wt% of HCHO in H 2 O) at 50 \u00b0C for 1 h in a basic condition (with a final pH value of 9.0). The slurry was filtered off and washed with distilled water until being free of chloride. This catalyst (denoted as S1) was kept in moisture before use. Catalysts S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 were prepared in the similar procedures to S1. The preparation procedures were summarized in detail in Table 1 . The loading amount of Pt in these catalysts was controlled to 5 wt% of the support. The textural structure of modified carbons was measured by nitrogen adsorption at \u2212196 \u00b0C using an OMNISORP 100CX system (COULTER Co., USA). All samples were pretreated at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h in high vacuum. Surface area and pour volume of the carbons were calculated from the adsorption isotherms. The dispersion of Pt was checked by CO adsorption. Sample (0.15 g) was firstly pretreated in hydrogen (50 cm 3 /min) at 150 \u00b0C for 1 h and purged with helium (50 cm 3 /min) for 1 h at the same temperature. And then, the catalyst was cooled to room temperature and CO pulses were injected from a calibrated on-line sampling valve. CO adsorption was assumed to be completed after three successive peaks showed the same peak areas. A CO/Pt stoichiometry of 1 was used for calculations [17] . The morphologies of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD analysis was performed on a Rigaku automated power X-ray diffractometer system (Cu K \u03b1 radiation, 45 kV, 100 mA) (RINT 2500, Japan). Diffraction data was recorded using continuous scanning at 0.02\u00b0/s, step 0.02\u00b0. TEM images were obtained using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV (TEM, JEOL-2020F). Samples were first ground to powder and dispersed on Cu grids in tetrachloromethane under supersonic-wave shaking. 2.2 Catalytic reactions A thermostat equipped with magnetic stirrer, thermocouple, glass reactor (100 cm 3 ) and gas supply system was employed for the oxidation of glycerol. About 50 cm 3 of 0.1 g/cm 3 glycerol solution and 0.5 g catalyst were added into the reactor. Constant flow of oxygen (150 cm 3 /min) was introduced into the suspension when the temperature reached 60 \u00b0C. After reaction (6 h) catalyst was removed by filtration and the aqueous solution was analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a refractive index (RI) detector and a Zorbax SAX column (HPLC, Agilent 1100 series). All products were confirmed with the standard mass spectrum in database and that of the standard products purchased from Alfa Aesar, SIGMA or TCI. The six successive reactions of recycled S1 are carried out in the same procedure as described above. The initial fresh catalyst weighted in 0.5 g was added into the reactor with 50 cm 3 of 0.1 g/cm 3 glycerol solution. After each run the used catalyst was recovered simply by filtration. 3 Results 3.1 The textural structure of carbon supports The surface area and pore structure of parent carbon, HNO 3 -C and H 2 O 2 -C are summarized in Table 2 . It was found that H 2 O 2 -C has a higher surface area (1492 m 2 /g) and a larger pore volume (0.9748 cm 3 /g) than that of parent carbon (1373 m 2 /g and 0.8853 cm 3 /g). However, these data of HNO 3 -C decreased sharply to 621 m 2 /g and 0.4023 cm 3 /g, respectively. These results indicate that the moderate oxidation of H 2 O 2 is favorable to improve the textural structure of parent carbon, while strong oxidation ability of HNO 3 (especially for the one with high concentration) could destroy the textural structure of parent carbon. 3.2 Dispersion of Pt on parent carbon, HNO 3 -C and H 2 O 2 -C Dispersion of Pt detected by CO adsorption is summarized in Table 3 . It can be found that the percentage dispersion of Pt decreased sharply from 29.1% (on H 2 O 2 -C in S1) to 3.4% (on HNO 3 -C in S6), which inferred that surface properties of support exhibited a significant role in the dispersion of Pt. The highest dispersion of Pt (83.2%) was detected in catalyst S4 (on H 2 O 2 -C) indicating that higher amount of reducing agent was unfavorable. The lower dispersion of Pt in S3 (11.8%) than that of S1 and S2 indicated that impregnation and reduction temperature are also important to obtain a well dispersed Pt/C catalyst. These results concluded that the dispersion of Pt depends strongly on the surface properties of support, the amount of reducing agent and the preparation temperature. TEM images of S1, S2, S3 and S6 are shown in Fig. 1 . The percentage histograms of the particle distribution were inserted in the top-right corner of the TEM images. The average Pt particle size in TEM image (summarized in Table 3 ) is calculated by d TEM = \u2211 n i d i 3 \u2211 n i d i 2 where n i is the number of particles having a characteristic diameter d i . Highly dispersed Pt particles were detected in catalyst S1 ( Fig. 1 A) and the majority of Pt particles were concentrated in 2.0\u20134.0 nm (mean 3.2 nm). Catalyst S2 ( Fig. 1 B) also exhibited a similar size distribution of Pt particles to S1 and the detected Pt particles sized mainly in 2.0\u20135.0 nm (mean 3.8 nm), whereas larger particles (in 5.0\u20137.0 nm) were also detected. A broad ranged Pt particles from 1.0 to 9.0 nm, along with a significant number of larger ones over 10 nm appeared in S3 ( Fig. 1 C). Severe aggregation of Pt was detected in S6 ( Fig. 1 D) and the calculated average particle size of Pt reached 26.5 nm. XRD patterns are displayed in Fig. 2 . It can be found that the intensity of the diffraction peaks of Pt enhanced in order of S4, S5, S1, S2, S3 and S6. The diffraction peaks of Pt in S6 became sharp and obvious, which confirmed the severe aggregation of Pt particles as that was detected in TEM ( Fig. 1 D). The crystalline sizes of Pt calculated by Scherrer\u2013Warren equation are summarized in Table 3 . The calculated crystalline size of Pt in S6 is smaller than that detected in CO adsorption and TEM, which could be ascribed to that Pt crystalline aggregated into bigger particles. This aggregation is also clearly displayed in Fig. 1 D. A sharp peak at 26.58\u00b0 that could be contributed to the diffraction of graphite [JCPDS 75-2078] was also detected in S6, which indicated that the oxidation of active carbon with a high concentration HNO 3 caused the graphitization of amorphous carbon. 3.3 Oxidation of glycerol over different sized Pt catalysts The activities of different sized Pt catalysts for glycerol oxidation at 60 \u00b0C in a base-free aqueous solution are summarized in Fig. 3 . It was found that the conversion of glycerol is similar when the particle size of Pt is smaller than 6.0 nm, but it decreased dramatically when the diameter of Pt is larger than 6.0 nm. The lower activity of larger sized Pt catalyst might be contributed to its lower metal surface area (summarized in Table 3 ) which restricted the adsorption of substrate. However, the selectivity of glyceric acid increased gradually with the growing of Pt particles. The glycerol oxidation reaction was carried out repeatedly with catalyst S1 for six times, and these results are summarized in Table 4 . Apart from glyceric acid (GLYA), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), glycolic acid (GLYCA), hydroxypyruvic acid (HPYA), and C 1 products (mainly CO x and formaldehyde) were also detected. It can be found that the conversion of glycerol and the product distribution remain stable during these recycles. The calculated turnover frequency (TOF, (mol of converted glycerol)/(mol of total Pt atom added) per hour) according to detected conversion of glycerol in the first 20 min on the basis of total loading of metals are in same level as that in literatures [18,19] . 4 Discussion In this work, a series of Pt/C catalysts with different Pt particle size were prepared in order to investigate the selective oxidation of glycerol in a base-free solution. N 2 adsorption found that chemical pretreatment of parent carbon with H 2 O 2 increased its surface area and pore volume (see Table 2 ). These alterations improved the dispersion of Pt (see Figs. 1A and 2 A). However, the strong oxidation ability of HNO 3 (especially one with high concentration) could destroy the textural structure of parent carbon (see Table 2 ), bring graphitization of amorphous carbon and decrease its surface area (see Fig. 2 ). CO adsorption, TEM and XRD characterizations indicated that the dispersion of Pt depended strongly on the surface properties of the support, the amount of reducing agent and the preparation temperature. A highly dispersed Pt catalyst with a percentage dispersion of more than 80% and average of Pt particle size less than 2.0 nm was prepared on a H 2 O 2 -pretreated carbon support (S4, Pt/H 2 O 2 -C). However, on the surface of HNO 3 -pretreated carbon, severe aggregation of Pt was detected (in catalyst S6). This aggregation could be contributed to the graphitization of amorphous carbon (see Fig. 2 ) that decreased its surface area (see Table 2 ) and decreased the amount of surface OH concentration. These changes would weaken the interaction between Pt and the support. When the particle size of Pt is smaller than 6 nm, the selective oxidation of glycerol could be performed successfully in a base-free condition. The calculated TOFs are at same level as is reported in literatures in a strong base solution [12,18] and this catalyst can be recycled with a stable activity (see Table 3 ). Most importantly, free glyceric acid can be obtained directly in this base-free solution. 5 Conclusions In this work, we confirmed that the selective oxidation of glycerol to glyceric acid could be performed successfully on small sized Pt catalysts in base-free conditions. Small sized Pt particles (<6 nm) had stable glycerol conversion and glyceric acid selectivity. Characterizations indicated that the dispersion of Pt depended strongly on the surface properties of the support, the amount of reducing agent and the preparation temperature.

        "abstract": "Co/SiO2 catalysts are prepared by impregnation method from different cobalt salt precursors, such as Co (NO3)2, Co(CH3COO)2, CoSO4 and CoCl2, respectively. The effects of cobalt salts, especially Co(NO3)2 and Co(CH3COO)2, on catalyst structure and performance in CO2/CH4 reforming are studied using activity evaluation as well as XRD, TPR, SEM and H2-TPD techniques. Among the catalysts investigated, Co/SiO2 starting from Co(CH3COO)2 exhibits the highest activity and stability. It maintains its high activity during 10 h of reaction at 973 or 1073 K, while the catalyst from Co(NO3)2 shows notable deactivation after reaction at the same temperatures for only 6 h. The higher the cobalt loading or the lower the temperature, the greater the activity difference between the two catalysts. The results of characterization show that Co/SiO2 catalysts prepared from Co(CH3COO)2 and Co(NO3)2 are greatly different in many ways, such as existence of Co species, metal-support interaction, Co0 particle size and resistance to sintering and coking. Combining the results of the reaction with the characterization of catalysts, it is established that CO2/CH4 reforming over Co/SiO2 catalyst is of structure sensitivity, and the activity and stability of the catalyst are close related to the degree of dispersion of metallic cobalt and resistance to sintering and coking, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Temperature-programmed reaction techniques and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize coke species deposited on a 5% Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst for dry reforming of methane. The CH 4 temperature-programmed decomposition profiles showed that the ignited decomposition temperatures of CH 4 increased from 273 to 378 \u00b0C when MgAl 2 O 4 replaced the catalyst support \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 . The temperature-programmed oxidation, temperature-programmed hydrogenation and temperature-programmed CO 2 reaction profiles showed that there were three carbon species (i.e. C \u03b1 , C \u03b2 and C \u03b3 ) on the catalyst surface. Raman spectroscopy showed that C \u03b3 was graphite-like carbon species, which was responsible for catalyst deactivation. The C \u03b3 species was the most inactive species toward H 2 and O 2 , while it was unexpectedly more active toward CO 2 . The unique reactivity of CO 2 with different coke specie could be ascribed to the carbonate, bidentate and formate species formation on MgAl 2 O 4 surface. These surface species enhanced the oxidation of C \u03b3 species and thus contributed to the high stability of Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst.",

The interaction of Zr - Al and surface reaction of CO on the catalysts have been investigated by XRD and TPSR - MS techniques. It was shown that addition of ZrO2 would remarkably increase CO oxidation activity of Pd/\ufffd\ufffd - Al2O3. In CO - TPSR, it was found that, in the presence of ZrO2, the position of the desorption peaks of CO or CO2 shifted toward to lower temperature, and the amount of CO2 in the desorbed product was more than that on Pd/\ufffd\ufffd - Al2O3 catalyst. Therefore, the amount of CO2 desorbed and the peak temperature follow the same order as oxidation activities. Mechanisms of the surface oxidative reaction were suggested.",

        "abstract": "The effect of manganese on the dispersion, reduction behavior and active states of surface of supported copper oxide catalysts have been investigated by XRD, temperature-programmed reduction and XPS. The activity of methanol synthesis from CO2/H2 was also investigated. The catalytic activity over CuO-MnOx/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation is higher than that of CuO/\u03b3-Al2Q3. The adding of manganese is beneficial in enhancing the dispersion of the supported copper oxide and make the TPR peak of the CuO-MnOx/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst different from the individual supported copper and manganese oxide catalysts, which indicates that there exists strong interaction between the copper and manganese oxide. For the CuOx/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst there are two reducible copper oxide species; \u03b1 and \u03b2 peaks are attributed to the reduction of highly dispersed copper oxide species and bulk CuO species, respectively. For the CuO-MnOx/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst, four reduction peaks are observed, \u03b1 peak is attributed to the dispersed copper oxide species; \u03b2 peak is ascribed to the bulk CuO; \u03b3 peak is attributed to the reduction of high dispersed CuO interacting with manganese; \u03b4 peak may be the reduction of the manganese oxide interacting with copper oxide. XPS results show that Cu+ mostly existed on the working surface of the Cu-Mn/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalysts. The activity was promoted by Cu with positive charge which was formed by means of long path exchange function between Cu - O - Mn. These results indicate that there is synergistic interaction between the copper and manganese oxide, which is responsible for the high activity of CO2 hydrogenation.",

The experimental thermodynamic data have been discussed in the light of interaction between molecules of the solvent and solute. Selective intermolecular forces are believed to be the main cause of PEG selectively dissolving and separating solutes. Selectivity of the PEG is not only observed to polar substances but also to apolar ones such as benzene and cyclohexane. We believe that the macromolecule can adjust its conformation when it receives a solute molecule, so as to more strongly interact with the small molecule. When such strong negative electric groups as carbonyl oxygen atom, nitro group approach ethylene of PEG or strongly positive charged hydrogen atom(s) approach(s) an oxygen atom of PEG, strong intermolecular forces occur and solution heats are large. On the other hand, strongly intermolecular force may be caused by a kind of synergistic interaction between the solvent and solute molecules. In such a case, a solute molecule is attracted by two or more sites on the polymer chain.",

Nobel metals (5 wt%, loading amount) showed higher coke resistance ability, while their activity was lower than that of Ni and Co (10 wt%, loading amount). Pulse CO adsorption experiments indicated that the dispersion of noble metals (such as Rh) depended strongly on its loading amount and the surface area of the support. Rh dispersed highly on meso-porous Al2O3 (with high surface area) and exhibited higher coke resistance ability and higher reforming activity. At the same time, small amount of Rh enhanced obviously both the reforming activity and coke resistance ability of Ni. \u00a9 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

        "abstract": "A novel noble metal catalyst supported on stainless steel treated by anodic oxidation for VOC removal was presented. The catalyst showed excellent activity for toluene combustion at 210\u00b0C even after calcination at 1000\u00b0C. The surface of the stainless steel support was comparatively smooth. After the anodic oxidation treatment, it became approximately a nanometer-sized complex oxide film and tightly coalesced with the metal domains. Active components could be dispersed on the surface of the oxide film easily and showed good catalytic activity. The calcination treatment affected the catalyst activity very much. There were large masses on the surface of the catalyst after calcination at 500\u00b0C for 2 hr. This new catalyst offers good prospects for application in the VOC combustion with the advantages of high activity, low noble metal content, and heat resistance.",

        "abstract": "In this study, influence of ethanol washing in precursor on CuO-CeO 2 catalysts in preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen (PROX) was investigated. BET, FTIR and TPR techniques were used. The results showed that ethanol washing was beneficial to improve the catalytic performance of CuO-CeO2 catalysts in the PROX. The CO conversion over CuO-CeO 2 catalysts without ethanol washing was only 85% at 190 \u00b0C, while the highest CO conversion over CuO-CeO2 catalysts with 200 mL ethanol washing was beyond 99% at 120 \u00b0C. XRD and TPR results showed that ethanol washing depressed the growth of CuO-CeO2 catalysts and improved the reducibility of CuO-CeO2 catalysts. The FTIR measurement proved that the absorption water was decreased by the way of ethanol washing, indicating that the amount of the H-O-H bridge between adsorption water and precursor of CuO-CeO2 catalysts was decreased and depressed the growth of CuO-CeO2 catalysts. \u00a9 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

XRD and TPR were used to characterize the phase, reduction property and particle size of the reduced catalyst. The addition of Ti to the CuO/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst made the copper in the catalyst exist in much smaller crystallites and exhibit an amorphous-like structure. The adding of Ti made the reduction peak shift toward lower temperature in comparison with the CuO/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst. The effect of the addition of Ti and the reaction conditions on the activity and selectivity to methanol from CO2 hydrogenation were investigated. The activity was found to increase with increasing surface area of metallic copper, but it is not a linear relationship. This indicated that the catalytic activity of the catalysts depends on both the metallic copper area and the synergy between the copper and titanium dioxide. The effect of contact time on the relative selectivity (\u03ba=SCH30H /SCO) and selectivity of methanol were also investigated. The results indicated that methanol was formed directly from the hydrogenation of CO2.",

        "abstract": "The catalytic activities of Co-Al hydrotalcite and the addition of transition metal oxides in NO+CO reaction were examined with a microreactor-gas chromatography (GC) reaction system. Experimental results show that Co-Al with addition of Cu cation is with higher catalytic activity for NO + CO reaction, and the activity of Co-Cu-Al hydrotalcite is affected by the molar ratio of Co:Cu:Al. When nCo:nCu:nAl was equal to 5:3:1, the activity was the highest with 100% NO conversion at reaction temperature of 120 \u00b0C. There were two CuO diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 35.5\u00b0 and 38.7\u00b0 but not a spinel diffraction peaks after Co-Cu-Al (5:3:1) was calcined at 350 \u00b0C. But a small amount of spinel was formed after Co-Cu-Al being calcined at 450 \u00b0C and the amount of spinel increased with calcination temperature, indicating that spinel formation affected NO reduction. As shown in NO-TPD-MS analysis, the thermal desorption products of NO absorbed on Co-Cu-Al are NO (m/e=30), N2O (m/e=44), N2 (m/ e=28) and O 2 (m/e=32). We suggest that the desorption species of NO occur at the weak positions of Co-Cu-Al in low temperature but at strong positions in high temperature. In addition, the desorption peak temperature of NO on Co-Cu-Al calcined at 400 \u00b0C is slightly lower than that calcined at 600 \u00b0C, indicating that the dissociation of NO on the surface of Co-Cu-Al is a rate-determining step in NO + CO reaction.",

        "abstract": "In this contribution, a commercial spherical SiO 2 was modified with different amounts of La 2 O 3 , and used as the support of Ni catalysts for autothermal reforming of methane in a fluidized-bed reactor. Nitrogen adsorption, XRD and H 2 -TPR analysis indicated that La 2 O 3 -modified SiO 2 had higher surface area, strengthened interaction between Ni and support, and improved dispersion of Ni. CO 2 -TPD found that La 2 O 3 increased the alkalescence of SiO 2 and improved the activation of CO 2 . Coking reaction (via both temperature-programmed surface reaction of CH 4 (CH 4 -TPSR) and pulse decomposition of CH 4 ) disclosed that La 2 O 3 reduced the dehydrogenation ability of Ni. CO 2 -TPO, O 2 -TPO (followed after CH 4 -TPSR) confirmed that only part amount of carbon species derived from methane decomposition could be removed by CO 2 , and O 2 in feed played a crucial role for the gasification of the inactive surface carbons. Ni/ x La 2 O 3 -SiO 2 ( x = 10, 15, 30) possessed high activity and excellent stability for autothermal reforming of methane in a fluidized-bed reactor.

The results indicated that H2O could lower NOx adsorption capacity of H-ZSM-5 at the adsorption stage, due to the competitive adsorption between H2O and NOx on the surface of H-ZSM-5. When the content of H2O was above 2%, the NOx breakthrough adsorption capacity of H-ZSM-5 remained stable at 2.0 mL g-1. At the discharge stage, the introduction of H2O decreased the total NOx conversion from 98.7% to 94.2%, while the conversion of adsorbed NOx to N2 from 94.0% to 83.9%. When increasing the CH4 concentration and the discharge power, the total NOx conversion and the conversion of adsorbed NOx to N2 moved up to 99.5% and 97.4%, respectively. In addition, although Ni-ZSM-5 exhibited better resistance to H2O than H-ZSM-5 for NOx adsorption, it showed inferior efficiency for NOx removal and nearly 15% NOx remained after the discharge stage. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Results were compared to that of the individual catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, H 2 -TPR and O 2 -TPD. For each individual Ag/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, three O 2 desorption peaks are attributed to the decomposition of the crystalline Ag 2 O phase and the dispersed Ag 2 O phase (I) and (II). For binary oxide catalysts, the silver promotes the reduction of manganese oxide and cobalt oxide. This process is attributed to the spillover of hydrogen from silver atoms to manganese oxide or cobalt oxide. However, the manganese oxide, cobalt oxide and cerium oxide can promote the oxygen reproduction of silver oxide catalyst. The activity of binary oxide catalysts is higher than that of individual catalysts for CO, acetone, pyridine oxidation and CO\u2013NO reaction.

This reaction was investigated under different temperatures, space velocities and feed gas composition. Results showed that the structure of the nickel active phase strongly depended on the interaction between Ni and the support, which was related to the support properties, the additives and the preparation methods. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, TPR, CO2-TPD and TEM techniques. Ni sintering was a major reason for the deactivation of pure Ni/SiO2 catalysts, while Ni dispersed highly on a 10 wt% Sr promoted Ni/SrO-SiO 2 catalyst. The enhanced interaction between Ni species and SrO-promoted support might be responsible for its high activity and good resistance to agglomeration of the nickel particles. \u00a9 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy.",

The catalysts, especially 12% CuO/TiO 2/\u03b3-Al2O3, showed high activities in NO+CO reaction. The NO conversion temperatures (T100%) were 300 \u00b0C and 275 deg;C for the catalysts pretreated by air and H2, respectively. The structural and reduction properties of CuO/TiO2/\u03b3-Al 2O3 catalysts were analyzed using the H2-TPR, XRD, and FT-IR methods. It was found that proper amount of TiO2 increased the CuO dispersion on TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O 3. The 12%CuO/TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst had four reduction peaks (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4). The \u03b1 and \u03b3 peaks were attributed to the reductions of highly dispersed CuO and crystalline CuO on the exposed TiO2 of TiO 2/\u03b3-Al2O3, respectively. On the other hand, the \u03b2 and \u03b4 peaks were attributed to the reductions of highly dispersed CuO and crystalline CuO on TiO2/\u03b3-Al 2O3, respectively.

        "abstract": "CuO\u2013CeO 2 is prepared by coprecipitation and ethanol washing and characterized using BET, HR-TEM, XRD and TPR techniques. The results show that CuO\u2013CeO 2 is nanosized ( r TEM = 6.5 nm) and possesses high surface area ( S BET = 138 m 2 g \u22121 ). Furthermore, some lattice defects in the surface of CuO\u2013CeO 2 are found, which are beneficial to enhance catalytic performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2 in preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen (PROX). Consequently, the nanostructured CuO\u2013CeO 2 exhibits perfect catalytic performance in PROX. Namely, CO content can be lowered to less than 100 ppm at 150 \u00b0C with 100% selectivity of O 2 in the presence of 8% CO 2 and 20% H 2 O at 120 , 000 ml g cat - 1 h - 1 . Keywords Preferential oxidation CO CuO\u2013CeO 2 Ethanol washing High surface area 1 Introduction PROX has been attaining an increasing interest in the past years because of the potential application of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells in the future [1\u20133] . Catalysts for this reaction request having a compromise between catalytic performance and cost of catalysts. Novel metal or rare metal catalysts such as Au, Pt, Rh, Ru often possess a very excellent catalytic performance in PROX [4\u20139] . However, they have an unavoidable problem, i.e., they are expensive. Activity of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalysts in PROX exhibits several orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional copper-based catalysts and comparable or superior to platinum catalysts [10\u201312] . Liu and Flytzani-Stepphanopoulos [13] reported that formation of copper clusters and strong interaction of copper with cerium oxide were desirable to achieve a high activity for CO oxidation. Therefore, CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst can obtain easily, due to its low cost, a very good compromise between catalytic performance and cost, and is a promising catalyst in PROX. However, CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalysts reported in literatures [14] often possess surface areas lower than 100 m 2 g \u22121 , which generally cause to the depression of catalytic performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst in PROX. Therefore, preparation of nanostructured CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst with higher surface area is attracting more attentions [15\u201317] . Ethanol is used to dehydration in coprecipitation process to achieve higher surface area and smaller particle size. For example, Xu et al. [18] reported that ethanol was used in ZrO 2 preparation by coprecipitation and found that ZrO 2 with ethanol washing ( S = 53 m 2 g \u22121 , d = 15\u201320 nm) had a higher surface area and smaller particle size in comparison with ZrO 2 without ethanol washing ( S = 27 m 2 g \u22121 , d = 40\u2013200 nm). In this study, we prepared a nanostructured CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst with high surface area by coprecipitation and ethanol washing. The CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic performance in PROX and can reduce CO content to less than 100 ppm with 100% selectivity at 150 \u00b0C in a feed of 1% CO, 1% O 2 , 50% H 2 , 8% CO 2 , 20% H 2 O and Ar in balance. 2 Experimental Sample one (expressed as 5CuC-ET) is synthesized by coprecipitation. The aqueous solution of 0.362 mol L \u22121 KOH is added dropwise within 30 min to the mixture of 0.055 mol L \u22121 Ce(NO 3 ) 2 and 0.008 mol L \u22121 Cu(NO 3 ) 2 solutions with vigorous stirring, and then aged for about 20 min. The pH value of supernate is 12.5 and the pH value of precipitate should be washed to 7.0 with deionized water, following to be washed with 200 ml ethanol before dried at 105 \u00b0C for 1 h. The dried sample is heated for about 2 h at 500 \u00b0C. Obtained product is crushed and sieved to 60\u201380 meshes. The loading of Cu in CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst is 5.0 wt%. BET surface area of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst is 138 m 2 g \u22121 . Sample two (expressed as 5CuC-WA) is synthesized following the above process except the ethanol washing. BET surface area of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst is 117 m 2 g \u22121 . The activity measurement is carried out in a fixed micro-reactor (quartz glass, 4 mm i.d., 6 mm o.d., length 250 mm) at atmospheric pressure. Reactor temperature is measured by K-type thermocouple located at the top of packed catalyst bed and controlled by a temperature controller. The mass of catalyst used in experiments ranges from 50 mg to 200 mg, and CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst is diluted with inert alumina particles (60\u201380 meshes) with a dilution ratio of 1:1 by mass. A desired mixture of gases (i.e. 50% H 2 , 1.0% O 2 , 1.0% CO, 0\u20138% CO 2 and Ar in balance) is achieved by adjusting the ratio of flows with mass flow controllers (Scientific Alicat Int., USA). Water vapor is introduced into reacting gases bubbling through a heated water bath. Reactor inlet and outlet streams are measured using an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionized detector (FID). H 2 and O 2 are separated by a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column and detected using TCD. CO and CO 2 are separated by a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column, then converted to methane by a methanation reactor and analyzed by FID. Taking into consideration of the existence of CO 2 in feedstock, CO conversion is calculated based on the CO decrease as follows: % of conversion of co = [ co ] in - [ co ] out [ co ] in \u00d7 100 And the selectivity is defined as the oxygen consumed by CO oxidation, namely: % of selectivity = 0.5 [ CO ] in - [ CO ] out [ O 2 ] in - [ O 2 ] out \u00d7 100 Specific area of samples is obtained at \u2212196 \u00b0C using a Coulter Omnisorp 100CX. Prior to the measurement, samples are pretreated at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h. TEM profiles are conducted using a JEOL JEM-2010 (HR) microscope operating at 100 kV. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns are recorded on a Rigaku D/Max 2550PC powder diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation. H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is carried out using a conventional reactor equipped with TCD. 50 mg catalyst and 5% H 2 /95% Ar (40 ml/min flowing velocity) are applied in this study. The heating rate is 10 \u00b0C/min from 30 to 350 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 TEM and XRD TEM images of 5CuC-ET are given in Fig. 1 . The average particle size of 5CuC-ET, seen from Fig. 1 a, is about 6.5 nm. Generally speaking, CuO exists in the CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst by several possible forms, that is, CuO clusters, bulk CuO and solid solution of CuO and CeO 2 [18,19] . Due to low copper atomic weight and poor contrast, CuO particles can not be distinguished from cerium even in the high resolution electron microscopy image (shown in Fig. 1 b). However, CeO 2 crystal lattice can be clearly distinguished (seen f area in Fig. 1 b). Especially, some lattice defects are found (seen e area in Fig. 1 b), which are beneficial to form reactive centers or yield active oxygen species [20] . According to the literature [21] , possible oxygen species are showed in following: O 2 = O 2 - = O 2 2 - = O - = O lat 2 - When increasing catalyst treatment temperature, the equilibrium shifts to the right. Therefore, superoxide species and peroxide species are supposed as the reactive oxygen species at low temperature ranges (e.g. from 100 \u00b0C to 170 \u00b0C) in PROX [21] . A superoxide species forms from the adsorption of an oxygen molecule on a single unsaturated surface cerium ion. Formation of peroxide species increases with the extent of reduction of cerium oxide surface. However, reactive oxygen species is not formed on conventionally prepared CeO 2 , and their formation on nano-structured CeO 2 ( S BET = 180 m 2 g \u22121 ; R = 5 nm) is enhanced by the presence of gold [22] . Evidently, high surface area and nano-sized CuO\u2013CeO 2 is beneficial to yield active oxygen species and enhance catalytic performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst in PROX. Fig. 2 illustrates XRD patterns of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalysts and pure CeO 2 . The major peaks are due to CeO 2 crystal phases and no CuO phases are found by XRD within its detection limit. The absence of CuO peaks may be attributed to fine dispersion of CuO or amorphous phase on the surface of ceria [23] , which gives a weak response and can\u2019t be detected. From Fig. 2 , it also can be found that the peaks of 5CuC-ET are broader than those of the other catalysts, which indicate that 5CuC-ET has a smallest particle size and ethanol washing is beneficial to yield nanostructured CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalysts. 3.2 H 2 -TPR H 2 -TPR profiles of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalysts are revealed in Fig. 3 . The over lapping reduction peaks are present: a low-intensity, low-temperature peak at 176 \u00b0C ( \u03b1 peak) and a higher-intensity peak at 196 \u00b0C ( \u03b2 peak). Liu et al. [18] reported that: (a) Isolated Cu 2+ ions can strongly interact with the support. (b) Weak magnetic associates consist of several Cu 2+ ions and these Cu 2+ ions have close contact with each other. (c) Small two- and three-dimensional clusters have structures so loose that they have no specific and regular lattice arrangement. (d) Large three-dimensional clusters and bulk CuO phase have characters and properties identical to those of pure CuO powder. According to the above summary, \u03b1 peak may be attributed to reduction of a and b type copper ions and \u03b2 peak probably represents the reduction of c type CuO particles. Compared with the reduction profile of 5CuC-WA, the reduction temperature of 5CuC-ET is lowered. To examine the stability of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst, CuO\u2013CeO 2 is reduced under the atmosphere of 5 vol% H 2 /Ar at programmed temperatures in a range from 30 \u00b0C to 350 \u00b0C and then cooled in air to ambient temperatures. This cycle is repeated for five times to investigate the stability of CuO\u2013CeO 2 . Seen from Fig. 3 , for the first cycle, the H 2 consumption amount and the ratio of \u03b1 peak to \u03b2 peak have no evident differences in comparison with fresh sample. However, for the fifth cycle, the H 2 consumption amount and the ratio of \u03b1 peak to \u03b2 peak increase slightly, and \u03b2 peak shifts to 203 \u00b0C. This phenomenon demonstrates that copper and cerium atoms redistributed because new sites of low energy became available during repeated reduction\u2013oxidation processes [24] . 3.3 Activity and selectivity of catalyst PROX over CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalysts is illustrated in Fig. 4 . From Fig. 4 , it is found that the concentration of CO in tail gas over 5CuC-ET is reduced to less than 100 ppm (namely, the CO conversion larger than 99.0%) when reaction temperature is increased to 120 \u00b0C and O 2 selectivity of 100% is obtained at temperatures lower than 110 \u00b0C. However, as for 5CuC-WA, the CO conversion is 85.3% at 190 \u00b0C and selectivity of O 2 is 100% at 175 \u00b0C. Obviously, 5CuC-ET has a better catalytic activity in PROX than 5CuC-WA, which is well proved by the above TEM and TPR (namely, ethanol washing can yield nanostructured CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalysts with high surface areas and is beneficial to improve the catalytic performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalysts). Generally, addition of CO 2 and H 2 O into feed has a strong negative influence on catalytic performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalysts which exists in the reformed gas produced by methanol [25] . As shown in Fig. 4 , catalytic activity of 5CuC-ET in PROX is depressed with the addition of CO 2 and H 2 O. At the space velocity of 120,000 ml g cat \u22121 h \u22121 , when CO concentration is less than 100 ppm, the corresponding reaction temperature is 150 \u00b0C in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O. Obviously, the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O in reactant feed has depressed tightly catalytic performance of 5CuC-ET. This is probably due to competitive adsorption of CO and CO 2 and H 2 O on the catalyst surface [26] . The presence of CO 2 and H 2 O in feed has also a significant influence on selectivity of O 2 . Selectivity of O 2 is obviously dismayed in the presence of CO 2 , while selectivity of O 2 is enhanced in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O and is 100% at 120 \u00b0C. It may be the main reason that the reverse water gas-shift reaction plays some influence on selectivity of O 2 in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O. 4 Conclusions In this study, nanostructured CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst exhibits a perfect performance in PROX at low temperatures ranged from 100 \u00b0C to 170 \u00b0C, and CO concentration can be lowered to less than 100 ppm at 150 \u00b0C with selectivity of 100% in the presence of 8% CO 2 and 20% H 2 O at a space velocity of about 120,000 ml g cat \u22121 h \u22121 . And TEM and XRD results exhibit that CuO is well dispersed on nanostructured CeO 2 and some lattice defects are found, which is helpful to enhance catalytic performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst. Therefore, nanostructured CuO\u2013CeO 2 catalyst prepared by coprecipitation and ethanol washing tends to possess an excellent catalytic performance in PROX.

Also, the effects of Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 and promoters, including Na2O, La2O3, and MgO, on activity and coking behavior of the catalyst were investigated. The results show that CH4 decomposition is a main contributor to coke deposition, which is suppressed effectively through increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 and adding promoters. Suppression of coke deposition caused by the promoters is in the following order: Na2O > La2O3 > MgO. Among the promoters, La2O3 and MgO hardly have any effect on the catalyst activity, while when Na2O was added, a drop in catalytic activity was observed. It is suggested that surface acidity of the catalyst is an important factor affecting catalytic activity and resistance to coke deposition.",

The morphology of carbon deposition formed on Ni catalyst surface was characterized by means of TG-DTA, Raman spectroscopy and TEM. CO2(O2)-TPSR-MS was used to prove that the carbon deposition on spent Ni/SiO2 catalyst can be completely removed by O2 after reaction with CO2. The chemical reactivity of carbon deposition were investigated by temperature programmed surface oxidation and hydrogenation. The results show that basic catalyst surface enhances resistance to carbon deposition. Three types of carbon deposition, C\u03b1, C\u03b2 and C\u03b3, are co-existing on Ni catalyst. All carbon deposition can be removed by O2 below 800\u00b0C. Only C\u03b1 can be removed by H2 at this temperature. The C\u03b3 are mainly graphite-like coke which leads to catalyst deactivation.",

Abstract The preferential oxidation of CO in rich hydrogen has been studied for CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts.

Keywords Preferential oxidation CO Excess hydrogen CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x Precipitator 1 Introduction Ceria has been widely used in catalytic systems for the elimination of the pollutants contained in the exhaust gases of automobiles [1] . This material contains a high concentration of highly mobile oxygen vacancies, which act as local sources or sinks for oxygen involved in reactions taking place on its surface [2] . Recently, CeO 2\u2212 x supported CuO catalyst has been attracting attentions because of its activity higher than that of conventional copper-based catalysts and comparable or superior to platinum catalysts for the preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen [3\u20135] . It is believed that the reaction is catalyzed by the interfacial copper oxide\u2013ceria centers in which ceria presents a high number of oxygen vacancies that permits a high mobility of lattice oxygen [6,7] , and the properties of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts have a great dependence on the preparation methods. For CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts, a number of preparation methods have been described, including co-precipitation [8,9] , urea-nitrate combustion method [10,11] , sol\u2013gel peroxo route [12] , etc. CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x prepared by co-precipitation had been studied by Avgouropoulos et al. [13] and Kim and Cha [14] . The catalysts are prepared with Na 2 CO 3 or NaOH solution as precipitators and show superior performance in the preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen at the temperature below 170 \u00b0C for a feed of 1% CO, 1% or 1.25% O 2 , 50% H 2 in the presence of H 2 O and CO 2 . In this work, we prepared the nano-structured CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts by co-precipitation with different ratios of KOH/K 2 CO 3 as precipitators, and the preferential oxidation properties of CO in rich hydrogen over the catalysts were studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts were prepared by co-precipitating aqueous salt solution of the metal with different ratios of KOH/K 2 CO 3 (4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3 and 0:4). The obtained precipitate was washed with de-ionized water to remove residual potassium, and then washed with ethanol before dried at 105 \u00b0C for 1 h. The dried samples were thermally treated at 500 \u00b0C for about 3 h. Thus, treated catalysts were crushed and sieved to 60\u201380 meshes. The Cu content in the catalysts was expressed as the Cu/(Cu + CeO 2 ) % weight ratio and all data below were obtained with the 5.0 wt.% Cu catalysts. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific areas of the catalysts were obtained at \u2212196 \u00b0C using a Coulter Omnisorp 100CX. Prior to the measurement, the catalysts were pretreated at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h. TEM profiles were conducted using a JEOL JEM-2010 (HR) microscope operating at 100 kV. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max 2550PC powder diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The mean particle diameter was calculated from the X-ray line broadening, according to Scherrer's equation. H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out using a conventional reactor equipped with a TCD. 2.3 Catalytic oxidation performance tests The catalytic performance measurement was carried out in a fixed micro-reactor (quartz glass, 4 mm i.d., 6 mm o.d., length 250 mm) at atmospheric pressure. The reactor temperature was measured by a K-type thermocouple located at the top of the packed catalyst bed and controlled by a temperature controller. The mass of catalyst used in the experiments ranged from 50 to 100 mg, and the catalyst was diluted with inert alumina particles (60\u201380 meshes) with a dilution ratio of 1:1 by mass. A desired mixture of gases H 2 , O 2 , CO, CO 2 , and Ar was prepared by adjusting the ratio of flows with mass flow controller (Scientific Alicat). The water vapor was introduced with reacting gases bubbling through a heated water bath. The reactor inlet and outlet streams were measured using an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). H 2 , O 2 , CO and CO 2 were separated using a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column. CO and CO 2 were converted to methane by a methanation reactor and analyzed by FID. The detection limit of CO is less than 5 ppm. Taking into consideration of the existence of CO 2 in feedstock, the CO conversion was calculated based on the CO decrease as follows: % \u2009 of conversion of CO = [ CO ] in \u2212 [ CO ] out [ CO ] in \u00d7 100 The selectivity is defined as the oxygen consumed by CO oxidation, namely: % \u2009 of selectivity = 0.5 ( [ CO ] in \u2212 [ CO ] out ) [ O 2 ] in \u2212 [ O 2 ] out \u00d7 100 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural studies of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts The pH values, the surface area, the particle sizes and the temperature required for 50% conversion of CO of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts are listed in Table 1 . From Table 1 , it can be seen that the addition of KOH results in a decrease in particle sizes from 8.3 to 5.4 nm and increase in pH values from 10.5 to 13.0 and surface area from 40 to 138 m 2 g \u22121 . In addition, when the KOH/K 2 CO 3 ratio, \u03bb , increased from 0:4 to 4:0, the oxidation performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts is improved greatly; i.e., the reaction temperatures with 50% conversion of CO are lowered from 182.6 to 82.5 \u00b0C. TEM images of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts prepared with \u03bb of 0:4 and 4:0, respectively, are presented in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1 , the statistical analysis of the dimension of the CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x particles results in a narrow distribution with a mean diameter around d TEM = 6.5 and 8.5 nm, respectively. In comparison with the data in Table 1 , the trend of size variation for both catalysts is similar, though the Scherrer's equation yields slightly lower values for the crystal size than TEM analysis [15] . The XRD patterns of all CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts are given in Fig. 2 . The distinct fluorite-type oxide structure of CeO 2 is present in all catalysts. It can be seen that with decreasing \u03bb value, the peaks of the catalysts become sharper and more intense, corresponding to an increase in size of the crystalline particles. Obviously, the addition of KOH into precipitator inhibits the growth of CeO 2 particles. No observable shift in the diffraction lines of CeO 2\u2212 x can be found in these catalysts, although Marb\u00e1n and Fuertes [15] reported that the XRD peaks of CeO 2\u2212 x are rather broad and shifts of small magnitude might be undetectable. Therefore, it can be concluded that this is dispersed among the ceria crystallites and not forming a true solid solution. CuO x must be in the form of clusters of XRD amorphous material on the surface of ceria crystals, at least for \u03bb > 0:4, since, as observed in Fig. 3 , at \u03bb = 0:4 small but conspicuous diffraction peaks of CuO are detected, meaning that crystallization of CuO starts to occur. It is evident that the addition of K 2 CO 3 into precipitator causes the growth of CuO and CeO 2\u2212 x particles. 3.2 Redox properties of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts H 2 -TPR profiles of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 and values of the H 2 consumption and peak temperature maxima are listed in Table 2 . From Fig. 3 and Table 2 , it can be seen that the curve of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst prepared with \u03bb of 4:0 shows two reduction peaks at 178 and 196 \u00b0C, respectively. The peak at 178 \u00b0C (called peak \u03b1) is ascribed to the copper ions strongly interacting with ceria, and the peak at 196 \u00b0C (called peak \u03b2) is assigned to the CuO clusters non-associated with ceria [16] . By addition of K 2 CO 3 into the precipitator, the hydrogen consumption peaks shift to higher temperatures and the areas of peak \u03b1 (namely the H 2 consumption) sharply diminish from 22 to 0 \u03bcmol/g cat . When \u03bb = 1:3, it can be seen that peaks \u03b1 and \u03b2 coalesce into overlap to one peak and a new peak, called peak \u03b3, appears at 242 \u00b0C. According to the results of XRD measurements above, peak \u03b3 is assigned to bulk CuO. When \u03bb = 0:4, the peak \u03b1 vanishes and the H 2 -TPR profile of the CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst only shows a main peak of hydrogen consumption at 245 \u00b0C (peak \u03b3) and a shoulder peak at 227 \u00b0C (peak \u03b2) in the range of 100\u2013350 \u00b0C. It is suggested that the addition of KOH into the precipitator is beneficial to the formation of dispersed CuO x clusters; however, the addition of K 2 CO 3 inhibits this process and yield bulk CuO with a large diameter. In addition, we find the observed trend in activity with variation of \u03bb values (seen in Table 2 ) correlates well with that of H 2 consumption of \u03b1 peak in H 2 -TPR of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts. This is in agreement with the proposition [7,17] that the high activity of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts is due to the presence of highly dispersed CuO clusters in strongly interacting with CeO 2\u2212 x , which has a superior reducibility; i.e., the higher reducibility of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts, the higher the catalytic activity. Therefore, the reduction peak \u03b1 appears at the lowest temperature and possesses the largest H 2 consumption for the catalyst with \u03bb = 4:0 among all catalysts, and the catalyst is most active. 3.3 Oxidation performance of catalysts The catalytic behavior toward preferential oxidation of CO in rich hydrogen over CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts are compared in Fig. 4 . The precipitators have an important effect on the catalytic performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst. From Fig. 4 , it can be seen that the CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts prepared with \u03bb of 4:0 shows the highest catalytic activity. Even at 110 \u00b0C, CO conversion higher than 99% is observed at a space velocity of 120,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 in the absence of CO 2 and H 2 O. CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts prepared with \u03bb of 1:3, 2:2, and 3:1 achieve the similar conversion of CO at the temperature of 130, 145, 175 \u00b0C, respectively, while the CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst prepared with \u03bb of 0:4 even cannot achieve the same conversion of CO in the similar temperature range of 70\u2013190 \u00b0C. The selectivity of O 2 for CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts shows a contrary trend. At low temperature range (lower than 120 \u00b0C), the selectivity of O 2 reaches 100%, due to no H 2 -oxidation reaction. However, with the increase of reaction temperatures, H 2 -oxidation reaction emerges and the selectivity of O 2 decreases with a further increase in the reaction temperature. Arias et al. [18] proposed a reaction scheme, in which Ce 4+ \u2013O 2\u2212 \u2013Cu 2+ pairs are rapidly reduced by CO to produce CO 2 . According to these authors CO (and also H 2 ) molecules are adsorbed on the copper\u2013ceria interfacial region of the catalyst and react with lattice oxygen to produce CO 2 (and H 2 O), reducing the copper ion Cu 2+ to Cu + . The ceria lattice then supplies the lost oxygen anion to the copper\u2013ceria interface and finally the so formed vacancies are refilled by gaseous oxygen. It is evident that in the above process, the existence on the catalytic surface of relatively higher amounts of easily reducible well dispersed copper oxide species strongly interacting with ceria is the key to the achievement of the superior catalytic performance. This is consistent with the above TPR results. As for the influence of WGSR (water\u2013gas shift reaction) or reverse WGSR, the catalytic performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst prepared with \u03bb of 4:0 in the feed gas of 1% O 2 , 8% CO 2 , 50% H 2 , and argon in balance is also investigated, and the results is illustrated in Fig. 5 . From Fig. 5 , it is found that the CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst is inactive for H 2 oxidation at temperatures up to 150 \u00b0C, and the concentration of CO is less than 10 ppm at 165 \u00b0C. Liu and Flytzani-Stephanopoulos [7] have also found that the thermodynamic equilibrium constant of the WGSR is at least 25 orders of magnitude lower than the thermodynamic equilibrium constant of CO and H 2 oxidation reactions in the temperature range of performed kinetic experiments, and that no reverse WGS reaction is observed over the CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst at temperatures below 155 \u00b0C. The results show that the reverse water gas shift reaction has a slight influence on the selectivity and activity of the CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst at the temperatures lower than 160 \u00b0C. Therefore, the O 2 selectivity of 100% can be obtained over the CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst when reaction temperatures are lower than 120 \u00b0C, due to no competitive oxidation of H 2 and side reactions. The influence of O 2 /CO is depicted in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6 (left), at a ratio of O 2 /CO up to 0.75, the CO conversion shows a very weak dependence of the O 2 /CO ratio. However, if the stoichiometric ratio of oxygen (O 2 /CO = 0.5) is fed to the reactor in the presence of hydrogen, the CO reaches its maximum value (about 98%) at a temperature of 100 \u00b0C. At higher temperatures, the CO conversion curve lowers again. Correspondingly, the selectivity of O 2 , seen in Fig. 6 (right), decreases as the increase in the O 2 /CO ratio. Because more and more water is formed when O 2 /CO ratio increases, oxygen more than the stoichiometric ratio is available for the H 2 oxidation reaction. We also investigated the influence of space velocity, CO 2 and H 2 O (seen in Fig. 7 ). According to literatures, both increase of space velocity and addition of CO 2 and H 2 O have a negative effect on the performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts. In the case of the space velocity of 120,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 , the curves of CO conversion and selectivity of O 2 over CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst, in comparison with 30,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 , are slightly lower, as seen from both left and right images of Fig. 7 . Similar trends can be seen for the addition of CO 2 and H 2 O. The temperature with CO conversion of 99% in the presence of CO 2 or in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O is 120 and 150 \u00b0C, respectively. It is evident that the addition of CO 2 and H 2 O depresses the performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts. In order to investigate the stability of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst prepared with \u03bb of 4:0, the duration test is run for 24 h at 120 \u00b0C and 120,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 of GHSV in a feed of 1% O 2 , 1% CO, 50% H 2 and Ar in balance. As shown in Fig. 8 , there is no obvious change in conversions of CO and selectivities of O 2 in the 24 h running test. CO conversions are kept at the values higher than 99% and selectivities of O 2 are kept at the values higher than 94% during the duration test. The result shows that the CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst possesses a desirable stability, which is consistent with literatures [5,10] . 4 Conclusions The structural properties as well as the catalytic performance of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts have a strong dependence on precipitators. The BET, XRD and TPR results indicate that the addition of KOH as precipitators inhibits the growth of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x particles and yields nano-structured catalysts ( d XRD = 5.4\u20138.3 nm), increases the surface areas of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts from 39.9 to 138.0 m 2 g \u22121 . It is also find that the intensity of \u03b1 peak in H 2 -TPR of CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts is in a good agreement with the oxidation performance of the CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalysts. Namely, the catalyst prepared with \u03bb of 4:0, maintaining the largest area of \u03b1 peak, achieves the superior activity for the preferential oxidation of CO in rich hydrogen. CO conversion higher than 99% with O 2 selectivity of 100% can be obtained for this CuO\u2013CeO 2\u2212 x catalyst at 90\u2013110 \u00b0C and a space velocity of 30,000\u2013120,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 in the absence of CO 2 and H 2 O or at 150 \u00b0C and a space velocity of 120,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O.

The interlayer space was enlarged and the surface area increased after montmorillonite (MMT) was pillared by zirconium and modified by cerium. The new support seems to play an important role in dispersing CuO. The good catalytic performance and reasonable cost, when comparing with noble metal type catalysts, make CuO/CZM catalysts a promising candidate for industrial processing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) elimination.",

It was found that the catalytic performance of Ni depends strongly on its particle size. The small-sized Ni catalyst exhibited higher activity and higher selectivity in the partial oxidation of COG. The conversion of CH4 was kept at 80.7% at a lower temperature (750 \u00b0C) and a wide space velocity (from 8000 to 80 000 h-1). CO2 reforming of COG is also an efficient route for syngas production. The H2/CO ratio in the COG-derived syngas could be controlled by manipulating the concentration of O2 or CO2 added in the feed. The yield of produced syngas increases with an increase in temperature. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.",

The supported Pd catalysts are characterized by XPS, TPR, TPO and TPSR techniques in order to study the oxidation/reduction properties. Activity tests in methane combustion show that addition of Y to Pd/Ce-Zr/Al 2 O 3 catalyst remarkably promotes its low-temperature and total conversion activity. In addition, the introduction of Y also greatly suppresses deactivation of Pd/Ce-Zr/Al 2 O 3 and endows Pd/Ce-Zr-Y/Al 2 O 3 with higher thermal stability than Pd/Ce-Zr/Al 2 O 3 . The characterization results of catalysts indicate that the addition of Y to Pd/Ce-Zr/Al 2 O 3 catalyst can effectively inhibit the decomposition of PdO particles and improve the reduction\u2013reoxidation properties of the active PdO species, which increases the catalytic activity and thermal stability of the Pd/Ce-Zr/Al 2 O 3 catalyst.",

In addition,different Pd/CuO ratio has different oxidation activity for the oxidation of CO and CH 4. By adjusting and changing the ratio of active component,it is possible to improve the surface oxygen desorption and recovery ability of catalysts,thereby increase the catalytic oxidation activity.",

The catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and O2 temperature-programmed oxidation. The results indicated that the high catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst are caused by taking stainless steel wire meshes as support and whose surface is covered by a porous anodic oxidation membrane. This porous anodic oxidation membrane is extremely efficient for supporting active compounds such as Pt, Pd, and Ce on the metal material.

These combined CeO 2 \u2013ZrO 2 /SiO 2 supports and supported Ni catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, XRD, NH 3 -TPD, CO 2 -TPD and H 2 -TPR. It was found that the combined supports integrated the advantages of SiO 2 and CeO 2 , ZrO 2 . That is, they have bigger surface area (about 300 m 2 /g) than pure CeO 2 and ZrO 2 , stronger acidity and alkalescence than that of pure SiO 2 , and enhanced the mobility of H adatoms. Ni species dispersed highly on these combined CeO 2 \u2013ZrO 2 /SiO 2 supports, and became more reducible. Ni catalysts on the combined supports possess higher CO 2 adsorption ability, higher methane activation ability and exhibited higher activity for MATR.

The catalytic properties of CuO/Ce0.2Ti0.8O2 and CuO/Ce 0.5Ti0.5O2 were examined using a microreactor-gas chromatography (GC) NO + CO reaction system and characterized by the methods of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that 12% CuO/Ce0.2Ti0.8O2 has the highest activity after calcined at 700 \u00b0C, showing a complete NO conversion at 275 \u00b0C. Support Ce0.2Ti0.8O2 had a larger specific surface area but less thermal stability than Ce 0.5Ti0.5O2. The results of TPR analyses indicated that both dispersed CuO and crystalline CuO are the active centers on the surface of the catalysts. The XRD and Raman data showed the formation of new mixed oxides, Ce4Ti9O24 and CeTi 2O6, at 700 \u00b0C.

The catalytic activity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation was found to be decreased after adding aluminum and increased after adding potassium in NiCo 2 O 4 sample. The small particle size of NiCo 2 O 4 was responsible for VOCs oxidation. The potassium was the most effective in promoting NiCo 2 O 4 sample in reducibility and surface area.

The effect of different content of Ni and base has also been investigated over PtNi/ZrO2 catalyst. With introduction of transition metals to Pt/ZrO2 catalyst shows a significant influence on the catalytic properties. PtCo/ZrO2 catalysts show the best yield of cinnamyl alcohol (CMO), and PtNi/ZrO 2 catalyst shows good yield of hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCMA). In the presence of base solution, rate of the hydrogenation of CMA over PtNi/ZrO 2(0.4 wt%) catalyst increases significantly and side reaction is remarkably inhibited. More bare metal atoms situated remote from the interface region on PtNi/ZrO2 catalyst surface are the reason of good selectivity of HCMA for PtNi/ZrO2 catalyst. \u00a9 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The removal of NO and CH4 has been studied with a hybrid system integrating plasma activation and four Cu-based catalysts. The best catalytic performance was observed for catalysts obtained from CuO/CeO2/ TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O3.The efficiency of NO removal decreased with the order: 12%CuO/10%CeO2/15%TiO2/\u03b3- Al2O3 > 12%CuO/15%TiO2/\u03b3-Al 2O3 > 12%CuO/\u03b3-Al2O3 > 12% CuO/TiO2. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD) Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and NO temperature- programmed desorption (NO-TPD) experiments were carried out to gain insight into the synergetic effects with the catalysts. The results revealed that copper species existed as bulk CuO crystalline for all the catalysts, H2-TPR suggested that the Cu2+ incorporated TiO2 or CeO 2 lattice and crystalline CuO might be the most active component for NO removal, and NO-TPD studies indicated that 12%CuO/10%CeO2/ 15%TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst had lower NO desorption temperature and larger peak area, which seemed to be responsible for the better catalytic activity over NO + CH4 reactions than other catalysts. \u00a92013 Elsevier B.V.

The catalytic properties are shown to increase upon introduction of metals to Pt/ZrO2 catalyst. Catalytic activities of the catalysts are enhanced except PtCr/ZrO2 catalyst. PtMn/ZiO2, PtCo/ZrO2 and PtFe/ZrO2 catalysts show good yield of cinnamyl alcohol (CMO), and PtNi/ZrO2 PtSn/ZrO2 catalysts show good yield of hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCMA). In the presence of NaOH and H2O, rate of the hydrogenation of CMA increases significantly and side reaction is remarkably inhibited. PtCo/ZrO 2 catalyst shows best catalytic activity (TOF 7.4\u00d710 -2 s-1) and yield of CMO (84.1 mol%). PtNi/ZrO2 catalyst shows best yield of HCMA (62.8 mol%).

The cytotoxicity of these complexes was tested by MTT and SRB assays. The cell cycle analysis and the levels of total platinum bound to DNA were measured by flow cytometry and ICP-MS. The results indicate that the complexes (a-g) have selectivity against tested carcinoma cell lines; they have weaker cytotoxicity against HCT-8 and MCF-7. Complexes a, b, d and g also exert weaker cytotoxicity against BGC-823 and complexes a, b, e and f have better cytotoxicity against EJ, but their cytotoxicity is weaker than that of cisplatin. Complexes c, e and f, confer substantially greater cytotoxicity against HL-60 with an IC(50) value of 7.68+/-0.23, 3.87+/-0.19 and 2.41+/-0.18 microM, respectively, moreover, cytotoxicity of complex f is equal to that of cisplatin. Complexes c, e and f cause significant G(2)/M arrest and a concomitant decrease of cell population in G(1) and S phases. The total DNA-platination levels of them are higher than that of cisplatin under the same experimental conditions. It suggests that there is no correlation between total DNA-platination levels in HL-60 cells and cytotoxicity of complexes. When leaving groups are aromatic carboxylates, the complexes have better cytotoxicity, moreover, the substituent in benzene ring also influences cytotoxicity. In addition, when leaving groups are dicarboxylates, dicarboxylates coordinating with platinum through oxygen atoms form different chelate cycle and cycle size also affects their cytotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "Esterification with microwave, as a new method to upgrade crude bio-oil, was brought forward according to the composition characteristics of bio-oil. Crude bio-oil was upgraded in ethanol using the 732 # cation exchange resin and ZnCl 2 exchanged resin as catalysts and using the microwave as heating resource. The results show that the ZnCl 2 exchanged resin performs a higher activity duing the upgrading process and the heating by microwave can effectively promote the upgrading process compared to traditional water-bath heating.The analyzed results by GC-MS show that the components of upgraded bio-oil are optimized greatly. Under the best reaction conditions the acetic acid conversion gets to 70.47% and the adverse components such as acids, ketones, aldehydes and phenols in crude bio-oil are removed during upgrading process. The kinematical viscosity of upgraded bio-oil decreases by 36.29% and the density decreases by 19.4% compared to that of crude bio-oil. While the heating value of upgraded bio-oil increases by 48.43%, which indicate that the quality of upgraded bio-oil is obviously improved.",

A bifunctional catalyst is needed for OHE reaction. Among tested bifunctional catalysts, the 5%Pd/Al(2)(SiO(3))(3) shows the best catalytic performance. Compared to the physical mixture of 5%Pd/C+Al(2)(SiO(3))(3), there is a synergistic effect between metal sites and acid sites over 5%Pd/Al(2)(SiO(3))(3) for the OHE reaction. A moderate reaction condition would be required to obtain high yields of alcohol and ester along with lower byproduct yields. In this work, the optimum selectivity to desired products (alcohol and ester) of 66.4% is obtained, where the conversion of furfural is 56.9%. Other components, typically present in bio-oils, have little effects on the OHE of FAL and HAc. This OHE method is a promising route for efficient upgrading of bio-oil.",

The results show that the addition of silica is effective in suppressing a phase transformation and therefore, in maintaining large surface area of alumina after heating at elevated temperatures. The stabilization effect of the silica species increases with the rise of silica content, however, the overabundance of silica species weakens its stabilization effect. The preparation conditions influence the thermal stability of alumina and stabilization effect of silica. Employing solgel and supercritical drying methods, silica-doped alumina materials with high thermal stability were prepared using NaAlO2 and water-soluble sodium silicate.",

During these reactions, esterification and cracking (alcoholysis and hydrocracking) were the two dominant processes. PtNi/MgO exhibited good performance, and gave a high yield (72.4 wt.%) of refined oil. The acid-base properties of the supports have an important effect on the coke deposition on the catalyst surface. The acidic catalysts gave the somewhat lower product yields, but tended to inhibit coking reaction. This would improve the life of the catalysts in the practical applications.

The strong acid sites declined upon introduction of rhenium to HZSM-5, and were not influenced by gallium. Compared with Ga/HZSM-5, Re/HZSM-5 exhibited remarkable enhancement of propane dehydrogenation while the decomposition slowed down with time on stream. Addition of CO 2 (30%) to the feed obviously inhibited the transformation of propane and the selectivity to aromatics. In contrast, addition of methane enhanced the selectivity to aromatic products. Meanwhile, formation of methane from propane was inhibited and the methane from the starting mixture was transformed.",

        "abstract": "Stainless steel monolith was chosen as catalyst support to overcome the drawbacks of poor thermal stability with catalysts using traditional \u03b3-Al2O3 and cordierite honeycomb as the substrate. During the catalyst preparation process, anodic oxidation technique was used to produce a porous membrane over the support surface, leading to effective dispersion of platinum and palladium on stainless steel monolith. The results show that the temperature for the total oxidation of acetone is 160, 160 and 200 \u00b0C, respectively, with the catalyst calcined at 500, 800 and 1 000 \u00b0C. The role of porous membrane over the stainless steel monolith surface is important for fixing active components of platinum and palladium particles, which leads to the enhanced catalytic activity for total acetone oxidation. This 0.1% Pt-0.02% Pd/stainless steel monolith catalyst exhibits the following advantages: a) high temperature stability in the whole temperature range investigated(500 \u223c 1 000 \u00b0C), b) better catalytic activity than those platinum and palladium supported catalysts over \u03b3-Al2O 3 and cordierite honeycomb support previously reported, c) low metal loading of platinum and palladium components (0.1 wt% Pt and 0.02wt% Pd). The microstructures, surface dispersion condition of platinum and palladium active components were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and energy- dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDX).",

The model reagents used were acetic acid and acetaldehyde. Different catalyst synthesis procedures were investigated and compared by varying the functional group incorporation method, platinum loading, reducing agent, etc. The textural and chemical properties of the catalysts made by the different synthesis procedures were characterized and compared with reactivity results. The need to create the organic acid sites prior to platinum incorporation was demonstrated. The efficacy of the bifunctional catalyst system for combined hydrogenation/esterification was demonstrated. Interestingly, the bifunctional Pt/SBA15-PrSO 3 H catalyst exhibited superior esterification activity with about twice the acetic acid turnover number relative to that with the monofunctional SBA15-PrSO 3 H catalyst. By combining metallic Pt nanoparticles with strong acid sites, this bifunctional mesoporous hybrid catalyst improved OHE activity and, therefore, has potential for application in the catalytic upgrading of bio-oil.",

The effects of addition of MnOx on activity and DME selectivity for hydrogenation of Cu - MnOx/Al2O3 catalysts were investigated by a micro reactor - GC system. The crystal structure and reduction property of the catalysts were also studied by means of XRD, TPR. The results indicated that the addition of MnOx increased the activity and DME selectivity of CuO/Al2O3 catalyst for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide, and the most active and selective for DME is the catalyst with a molar ratio of Cu/Mn = 1:1. The addition of MnOx cause the TPR peak of CuO/Al2O3 to move to a high temperature; at the same time, the hydrogen spillover on Cu made MnOx reduction easier. The results of XRD indicated that the addition of MnOx increased the dispersion of CuO on \u03b3 - Al2O3.",

        "abstract": "The CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides at different mole ratios (x=0.1\u20131.0) were prepared by co-precipitation of TiCl4 and Ce(NO3)3. The structural and reductive properties of the CexTi1-xO2 were affected by calcination temperature. At x=0.1\u20130.3, CeTi2O6 phase was formed and mainly as amorphous after calcination at 650\u00b0C. At x=0.3, only CeTi2O6 was formed after calcination at 750\u00b0C and CeTi2O6 crystallized completely after calcination at 800\u00b0C. TPR analyses showed that the amount of H2 consumption by CexTi1-xO2 (650\u00b0C) (except x=0.1) was greater than that by single CeO2, and the valence of CeO2was the lowest (+3.18) at x=0.3. CuO/Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 was prepared by the impregnation method and catalytic properties were examined by means of a GC micro-reactor NO+CO reaction system, BET, TPR, XRD, XPS and NO-TPD. It was found that CuO/Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 calcined at 650\u00b0C had the highest activity in NO+CO reaction with 100% NO conversion at reaction temperature of 300\u00b0C, and at 650\u00b0C Ce0.3Ti0.7O2just began to crystallize. The catalytic activities were largely affected by the pre-treatment conditions. At low reduction temperature (100\u00b0C), CuO species was difficult to reduce. When high degree of reductions took place, both CuO species and Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 reduced and thus a part of CuO species on the support surface would be covered. The XPS and NO-TPD analyses showed that CuO/Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 had four NO absorption centers (Cu+, Cu2+(I), Cu2+(II) and Ce3+). The CuO species involving in NO+CO reaction included Cu2+(I) and Cu+, and CeO2 species (Ce3+ and Ce4+).",

The XRD analysis could only detect \u03b3-Al2O 3 crystal diffraction and weak CuO crystal diffraction peaks after 15%CuO loading. There were two H2-TPR reduction peaks in CuO-TiO 2/\u03b3-Al2O3, the \u03b1 peak due to the highly dispersed CuO which spread on \u03b3-Al2O3 surface and the other peak due to the highly dispersed CuO which dispersed on 15%TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O3 surface. The DRIFTS analysis showed that catalysts with pretreatment in air or H2 atmosphere adsorbed NO+CO gases, and the N2O adsorption peaks appeared at 200 and 150\u00b0C, respectively.",

Abstract The influence of transition metal (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) on the hydrogenation properties of chloronitrobenzene (CNB) over Pt/TiO 2 catalyst has been studied in ethanol at 303 K and normal pressure. The hydrogenation of CNB can be carried out over Pt/TiO 2 catalyst. The order of the hydrogenation rate of CNB is m > p > o , and the yield of chloroaniline (CAN) is p > m > o . The effect of transition metal may be interpreted by electronic effect. Electron deficient species of the second element promote the specific rate constant turnover frequency (TOF) expressed on a per surface Pt atom by activating the nitrogen\u2013oxygen bond. The conversion of CNB is over 99% and chloroaniline is main product on the hydrogenation of CNB over PtM/TiO 2 catalysts. PtFe/TiO 2 catalyst shows the best selectivity of CNB to CAN, and 98.0 mol% for p -CAN, 98.5 mol% for m -CAN and 98.7 mol% for o -CAN, respectively. Both catalytic activity and yield of p -CAN increase with addition of Fe over Pt/TiO 2 on the hydrogenation of p -CNB. Keywords Transition metals Chloronitrobenzene Chloroaniline Hydrogenation 1 Introduction Haloamine is important intermediates for synthesis of organic fine chemicals, such as dyes, drugs, herbicides and pesticides. The main route to these haloamines is through the reduction of the corresponding nitrocompounds, either with metal\u2013acid systems or with hydrogen and a noble metal catalyst. The hydrogenation has been attention for its lower impact on the environment. However, the process of the catalytic reduction is difficult because of extensive dehalogenation. The catalysts of the hydrogenation have been well-studied, such as palladium, platinum, rhodium, nickel and copper chromite catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts have received much attention for minimizing dehalogenation combined with a fast rate of nitro-group reduction [1,2] . To improve the hydrogenation selectivity, special additives (promoters and inhibitors) or modified preparation of platinum catalyst are used [3\u20137] , but none of the catalysts previously proposed are completely satisfactory, each having its own particular limitations. Transition metal complexes have been studied widely as homogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of organic compounds. They have also been used as co-catalyst in a large variety of chemical reactions. Polymer-anchored platinum [8\u201311] , palladium [12] and ruthenium [13\u201315] homogeneous catalysts modified by transition metal cations and its metal complexes show better catalytic properties on the hydrogenation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsturated aldehydes and chloronitrobenzene. However, from the point of view of green chemistry, the development of industrial processes for direct production of organic intermediates using heterogeneous catalysts is an industrially meaningful target, since the catalysts could be easily removed from the reaction mixtures and wastes could be largely diminished. Monometallic-supported catalysts are widely used for this purpose, but bimetallic catalysts show growing attention, as the addition of a second metal can drastically improve the activity and/or selectivity towards the desired product [16] . The aim of the present work is to study the hydrogenation properties of m -, o - and p -chloronitrobenzene (abbreviated as m -, o - and p -CNB) with PtM/TiO 2 catalysts (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) and to compare the selectivity and activity with the monometallic platinum catalysts in the heterogeneous system. 2 Experimental The monometallic Pt/TiO 2 catalyst is prepared by conventional impregnation with an aqueous solution of hexachloroplatinic acid. The content of platinum is 0.3 wt.%. The sample impregnated is reduced by KBH 4 , filtered with large amount of water, dried at 373 K overnight, and then calcined at 673 K for 4 h. The bimetallic PtM/TiO 2 catalysts (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) are also prepared by impregnation, i.e. platinum may be impregnated after the transition metal is impregnated on TiO 2 . The preparation process is similar to Pt/TiO 2 , and the content of M and Pt is 0.04 and 0.3 wt.%, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a conventional method to give detailed information about the shapes, mean size and size distribution of metallic dispersions. The size of the platinum metallic particles is checked by TEM using a JEM-200CX apparatus. The results are shown in Table 2 . A typical hydrogenation procedure is conducted as follows: the catalyst is added into a 50 ml three-necked bottle closed with a self-sealing silicon rubber cap and connected to the vacuum, hydrogen lines and a constant pressure gas burette. The reaction temperature is maintained by a thermostat. After the air in the reactor is replaced with hydrogen, 10 ml of ethanol solution is added. Then the catalyst is activated under hydrogen with magnetic stirring at 303 K for 1 h before 10 ml ethanol solution of chloronitrobenzene (4\u00d710 \u22123 mol of substrate) is injected into the reactor. The course of the reaction is monitored by the hydrogen uptake measured by the constant pressure gas burette. Chemical analysis of the products is performed by gas chromatography Perkin-XL, equipped with a FID detector and SE-30 capillary column. Reactants and products are identified by comparison with authentic samples. Biphenyl is used as internal standard. Several experiments using different amounts of catalyst were carried out in order to determine the diffusion control region in order to eliminate mass transfer limitations during our studies. 3 Results and discussion Hydrogenation of chloronitrobenzene is a complicated process as described elsewhere [17,18] , and it often yields many by-products at the same time. As mentioned preciously, catalyst modified by Fe often shows good hydrogenation properties. We investigate the effect of different Fe amount and different addition way of Fe on the hydrogenation of p -CNB over Pt/TiO 2 catalyst. The results are listed in Table 1 . The conversions of CNB are all over 99%. From Table 1 , we can see that Pt/TiO 2 can catalyze the hydrogenation of p -CNB at 303 K and normal pressure. We also find catalytic activity increases remarkably when a small amount of Fe is added in Pt/TiO 2 catalyst. The hydrogenation rate of p -CNB increases from 38.8\u00d710 \u22122 to 73.2\u00d710 \u22122 mol H 2 g \u22121 min \u22121 , but catalytic activity decreases sharply when the content of Fe is higher than 1.0 wt.%. The yields of p -CAN are all improved with addition of Fe. Addition way of Fe has significant influence on hydrogenation properties for the hydrogenation of p -CNB. The catalytic activity increases slightly with addition of equivalent Fe 3+ to reaction system catalyzed by Pt/TiO 2 catalyst, but the yield of p -CAN is remarkably improved from 92.8 to 98.5 mol%. FePt/TiO 2 catalyst also shows high catalytic activity and yield of p -CAN, but which are slightly lower than that of PtFe/TiO 2 catalyst. The reason is probably that Pt active center is partly covered by Fe. Tables 2\u20134 list the results of hydrogenation of p -, m - and o -CNB catalyzed by Pt/TiO 2 and PtM/TiO 2 catalysts, respectively. From Table 2 , we can see that the additions of small amount of transition metals to Pt/TiO 2 catalyst improve obviously catalytic activity and yield of p -CNB to p -CAN. The hydrogenation rate increases in the order: PtFe/TiO 2 > PtNi/TiO 2 > PtCo/TiO 2 > PtMn/TiO 2 > PtCr/TiO 2 > PtCu/TiO 2 > Pt/TiO 2 , and the yield of p -CAN increases in the order: PtFe/TiO 2 > PtCu/TiO 2 > PtNi/TiO 2 > PtCo/TiO 2 > PtMn/TiO 2 > PtCr/TiO 2 > Pt/TiO 2 . For the hydrogenation of m -CNB, PtM/TiO 2 catalysts show different hydrogenation properties. The results are listed in Table 3 . From Table 3 , we find that PtCr/TiO 2 catalyst shows the best catalytic activity (the value of TOF is 0.66) and lowest yield of m -CAN (90.6 mol%), but the addition of Cu to Pt/TiO 2 decreases the catalytic activity. PtFe/TiO 2 catalyst shows the highest yield of m-CAN (98.5 mol%). The addition of transition metal (Mn, Co and Ni) has no distinct effect on catalytic activity and yield of m-CAN. From Table 4 , we can find that the additions of transition metals have also influence on the hydrogenation of o -CNB over PtM/TiO 2 catalysts. The addition of small amount of transition metals except Cu increase slightly the catalytic activity of the hydrogenation of o -CNB, and has different influence on the yield of o -CNB to o -CAN. PtFe/TiO 2 and PtCo/TiO 2 catalysts show better yield of o -CAN with 98.7 and 97.4 mol%, respectively. For PtNi/TiO 2 catalyst, the catalytic activity is improved but low yield of o -CAN is obtained (84.4 mol%). As indicated above, Pt/TiO 2 catalyst modified by small amount of transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) exhibits different hydrogenation properties for the hydrogenation of CNB. Among the catalysts, PtFe/TiO 2 exhibits the best yield of o -, m - and p -CNB to their corresponding CAN products. The high catalytic activity is also found for PtFe/TiO 2 catalysts on the hydrogenation of p -CNB. The effect of transition metal may be usually interpreted by electronic effect and/or geometric effect. As reported by literature, most of the bimetallic formulations the activity is enhanced at low M/Pt ratio, i.e. good hydrogenation properties is found on large Pt particles. Such behavior was also reported by Galvagno et al. [19] for nitrobenzene hydrogenation over PtSn/nylon catalysts and Coq [20] for p -CNB hydrogenation over Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. It was explained in part by a re-dispersion of the Pt particles. This interpretation cannot be applied in the present work for on the one hand the starting Pt/TiO 2 catalyst had a mean particle size of 1.9 nm, on the other hand these Pt particles did not change in size when adding the second metal (see Table 2 ). We prefer the second interpretation proposed by Galvagno et al. [19] , suggesting that the tin species on the N\u2013O bond, which becomes more reactive towards the attack by chemisorbed hydrogen. PtFe/TiO 2 catalyst shows better catalytic activity than that of catalysts. Ionic and electron deficient Fe species would be the active centers for N\ue605O activation in these bimetallic formations. It is well known that copper metal catalysts usually show better catalytic properties on the selective hydrogenation of various organic compounds. However, copper metal catalysts are easily poisoned by sulfide and chloride. In our experiment, PtCu/TiO 2 catalyst shows low catalytic activity, which may be related to the chlorine from the hydrogenolysis of the C\u2013Cl bond and/or from hexachloroplatinic acid. Fig. 1 gives the kinetic curves of hydrogenation of p-CNB catalyzed by PtM/TiO 2 catalysts. From Fig. 1 , we find that platinum catalysts modified by transition metal show similar catalytic behavior on the hydrogenation of p -CNB. The catalytic activities are all higher than Pt/TiO 2 catalyst is used alone. The hydrogen consumption is lined with reaction time at the start of reaction. Comparison of the results with Tables 2\u20134 reveals that the rates of hydrogenation of CNB are greatly affected by the position of substituent groups for the hydrogenations of CNB catalyzed by Pt/TiO 2 . The rates of the hydrogenations increase in the order: m > p > o , and the yields of CAN increase in the order: p > m > o . However, when metal catalysts such as Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru are used for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene derivatives, the hydrogenation rates usually increase in the order: o > m > p [21] . The different effect may be related with the special nature of support TiO 2 . The strong metal/support interaction state of Pt/TiO 2 is responsible for the good catalytic activity on the hydrogenation of CNB. Our results also indicate that different catalytic process is found on the hydrogenation of o -, m - and p -CNB. 4 Conclusions Pt/TiO 2 catalyst can catalyze the hydrogenation of CNB at 303 K and normal pressure. The conversions of CNB are all over 99%. The order of hydrogenation rate of CNB is m > p > o , and the yield of CAN is p > m > o . Both catalytic activities and yields of p -CAN are all improved over Pt/TiO 2 catalysts with the introductions of transition metal on the hydrogenation of p -CNB. The effect of transition metal may be interpreted by electronic effect. Electron deficient species of the second element promote the turnover frequency of Pt atoms by activating the nitrogen\u2013oxygen bond. Addition of the second metal improves the yield of p -CAN from 92.8 to 98.0 mol% at high p -CNB conversion. For the hydrogenation of m -CNB, only PtCr/TiO 2 shows good catalytic activity. PtFe/TiO 2 catalyst shows 98.5 mol% of m -CAN. There are no distinct effect on the catalytic activity and yield of m -CAN for Pt/TiO 2 catalyst modified by Ni, Co and Mn. The catalytic activity increases slightly on the hydrogenation of o -CNB over PtM/TiO 2 catalysts. However, only PtFe/TiO 2 and PtCo/TiO 2 show good yield of o -CAN with 98.7 and 97.4 mol%, respectively. The content of Fe in PtFe/TiO 2 catalyst has significant influence on catalytic properties for the selective hydrogenation of p -CNB. Both catalytic activity and yield of p -CAN increase with addition of Fe. References [1] J.R. Kosak (to E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co.), US Patent 4,020,107 (1977). [2] L. Cerveny I. Paseka V.

        "abstract": "The effect of rare earths (Sm 3+ , Pr 3+ , Ce 3+ , Nd 3+ and La 3+ ), base (inorganic or organic base) and substrate concentration on the hydrogenation properties of p -chloronitrobenzene ( p -CNB) over poly-vinylpyrrolidone-anchored platinum (PVP\u2013Pt) has been studied in ethanol at 303 K and normal pressure. The addition of rare earths except Nd 3+ and La 3+ to catalytic system improves the selectivity of p -chloroaniline ( p -CAN) but has lower activity when PVP\u2013Pt alone is used. The hydrogenation rate of p -CNB and selectivity of p -CNB to p -CAN increase significantly for PVP\u2013RE\u2013Pt and PVP\u2013Pt catalysts in the presence of NaOH. PVP\u2013Sm\u2013Pt catalyst exhibits the highest selectivity (95.8%) of p -CAN when the molar ratio of NaOH to substrate is 0.12. In the same reaction condition, PVP\u2013Ce\u2013Pt \u2217 catalyst using PVP (90,000) of large molecular weight as support exhibits the highest activity (60.5 mol H 2 mol Pt \u22121 min \u22121 ) and selectivity of p -CAN (98.2%). Keywords Hydrogenation p -Chloronitrobenzene p -Chloroaniline 1 Introduction Aromatic haloamines are important intermediates in the chemistry of dyes, drugs, herbicides and pesticides. The traditional synthesis routes are usually harmful for the environment. It seems to be a best choice by selective hydrogenation of aromatic halonitro compounds to the corresponding haloamine; however, the process is difficult because of extensive dehalogenation [1] . Dehalogenation has been seen to occur with palladium [1\u20133] , platinum [1\u20133] , rhodium [4] , nickel [5] and copper chromite [6] catalysts. Among these, platinum shows better selectivity of haloaniline and fast rate of reduction of the nitro group. To improve selectivity, the catalyst preparations are modified (alloying [7] and metal/support interaction [8] , etc.) or specific additives (promoters or inhibitors) [9\u201311] are used in the reaction system. Catalytic hydrogenation reactions are influenced by many factors, which include the presence of catalytic activators or poisons, the temperature, pressure, solvent agitation and other conditions specific to the particular process. One of the more important considerations is the catalyst support. Water-soluble polymer supports have received much attention in the recent years [12\u201315] , they are often used as support for nano-size ultrafine particles. The polymers work not only as stabilizers of ultrafine particles but also as the materials functionalizing ultrafine particles. Their special features result in cooperative and multi-step catalysts in reaction [16] . Lanthanides (rare earths) have been investigated and utilized in many fields [17] . The first report on the promotion effect of lanthanides appeared in the study of supported catalysts for synthesis gas conversion [18] . For adsorption characteristics, lanthanides and transition metals show higher efficiency when they are used together than when used separately; however, the promotion effect of lanthanides has been observed only in a heterogeneous system, and the promotion effect in a homogeneous system has seldom been successfully reported. In our experiment, we find that lanthanides also decrease catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of p -chloronitrobenzene ( p -CNB), but they show high selectivity of p -chloroaniline ( p -CAN). 2 Experimental Poly-vinylpyrrolidone-anchored platinum (PVP\u2013Pt) catalysts are prepared by alcoholic reduction in the presence of PVP, of average molecular weight 30,000 or 90,000, purchased from BASF. A mixture of 8.7\u00d710 \u22125 mol hexachloroplatinic acid, 30 ml ethanol and 0.222 g PVP (1.00\u00d710 \u22122 mol as monomeric unit) is refluxed in a 50 ml flask for 3 h under air. The black catalyst is abbreviated as PVP\u2013Pt (or PVP\u2013Pt \u2217 ). PVP\u2013rare earth\u2013Pt catalysts are prepared as follows: A mixture of 0.222 g of PVP, 20 ml ethanol and 5.2\u00d710 \u22126 mol rare earth nitrate is refluxed for 1 h, and then 8.7\u00d710 \u22125 mol hexachloroplatinic acid and 7 ml of ethanol are added to it. The mixture is also refluxed for 2 h under air. The orange catalyst is abbreviated as PVP\u2013RE\u2013Pt (or PVP\u2013RE\u2013Pt \u2217 ). Hydrogenation of p -CNB is carried out at 303 K and atmospheric pressure. A mixture of 2.0 ml PVP-anchored platinum catalyst (5.8\u00d710 \u22126 mol Pt), and 8 ml ethanol solution containing NaOH are placed in a 3-necked flask closed with a silicon rubber cap and connected to a hydrogen gas burette. The mixture is treated under hydrogen at 303 K for 30 min before 10 ml ethanol solution of p -CNB (4\u00d710 \u22123 mol substrate) is injected into the reactor. The hydrogen consumption is monitored with a graduated gas burette. Chemical analysis of the products is performed by gas chromatography Perkin-XL equipped with a FID detector and SE-30 capillary column. Reactants and products are identified by comparison with authentic samples. Biphenyl is used as internal standard. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of base concentration and different base Hydrogenation of p -CNB is a tedious process as shown in Scheme 1 [13] , and it often yields many by-products at the same time. It is well known that alkali in large quantities promotes dehalogenation; critical amounts of special inorganic [19] or organic [20] bases can greatly increase the selectivity of platinum catalyst. Base modifies the catalytic activity, probably they can enhance the solubility of hydrogen in ethanol. In our experiment, we also obtain similar results that are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . From Table 1 , it is found that the hydrogenation of p -CNB can also be catalyzed by PVP\u2013Pt under normal pressure of hydrogen at 303 K without the addition of NaOH, but both catalytic activity and selectivity increase remarkably in the presence of NaOH. Only 25 min is required to complete the reaction in the presence of 4.8\u00d710 \u22124 mol NaOH, whereas without NaOH only 94.1% of the conversion takes place in 100 min, and the selectivity of p -CAN is improved from 78.5 to 91.1%. Increasing the amount of NaOH up to 0.05\u20130.31 mol%, the catalytic activity is kept constant, and the selectivity declines appreciably. From Table 2 , we can see that using other inorganic bases, such as KOH, K 2 CO 3 and NaOAc, also gives good catalytic activity but has no effect on the selectivity of p -CAN except when KOH is used. Using n -Bu 3 N and Et 2 NH organic base also give similar results, the catalytic activity and selectivity of p -CAN increased markedly. The catalytic activity decreases slightly in the presence of NH 2 (CH 2 ) 2 NH 2 , but the selectivity of p -CAN reaches 96.5%. The reason is that the amino group in NH 2 (CH 2 ) 2 NH 2 has strong coordination with Pt, which decreases the active sites of the catalyst, and hydrogenolysis of the C\u2013Cl bond is inhibited. The role of the base may be related to its intervention in the catalytic cycle in some way. In our experiment, we also find that the selectivity of p -CAN increases with the increase in the concentration of the substrate. The results are listed in Table 3 . High concentration of the substrate probably prevents the products from contacting with the active sites, which partly inhibits hydrogenolysis of the C\u2013Cl bond [21] . 3.2 Effect of rare earth ions The results of the hydrogenation of p -CNB catalyzed by PVP\u2013RE\u2013Pt are summarized in Table 4 . From Table 4 , we can see that the hydrogenation rate of p -CNB decreases, obviously with the introduction of rare earth ions, but the addition of Sm 3+ , Pr 3+ and Ce 3+ shows positive effect on the selectivity of p -CNB to p -CAN. In the presence of NaOH, catalytic activities and selectivities increase significantly. PVP\u2013Sm\u2013Pt catalyst exhibits the best selectivity of p -CAN (96.8%). Different cross-linking of PVP has a different character. Table 5 lists the results on the hydrogenation of p -CNB over PVP\u2013RE\u2013Pt \u2217 catalysts (the average molecular weight of PVP is 90,000). From Table 5 , we can see that the effect of rare earths except Nd 3+ and La 3+ on the catalytic activity and selectivity is not obvious without the addition of NaOH. In the presence of NaOH, catalytic activity is also improved but the selectivity of p -CNB to p -CAN varies desultorily. PVP\u2013Ce\u2013Pt \u2217 catalyst exhibits the best selectivity of p -CAN (98.2%). On Comparing Table 4 with Table 5 , we can conclude that support takes on an important role for this reaction. Teranishi et al. [15] pointed out that weak coordination between PVP and Nd 3+ is a reason for low activity. Low cross-linking of PVP has a weak coordinative ability to rare earth ions especially for Nd 3+ and La 3+ . Rare earth ions also influence the coordination between PVP and Pt. In the experiment, we find that some platinum black forms for low cross-linking of PVP-supported platinum catalyst, and the phenomena is always accompanied with low activity. In high cross-linking of PVP catalytic system, these phenomena are not observed. The effect of Ce 3+ on the hydrogenation of p -CNB over PVP\u2013Pt \u2217 catalyst is also investigated. Fig. 1 demonstrates the effect on catalytic activity and selectivity with the addition of Ce 3+ . From Fig. 1 , it is found that catalytic activity is inhibited remarkably when a small amount of Ce 3+ is added in PVP\u2013Pt \u2217 catalyst, and selectivity is also low in the presence of NaOH. It is interesting that catalytic activity and selectivity to p -CAN increase monotonously with increasing molar ratio of Ce 3+ /Pt from 0.01 to 0.06. The average rate of the hydrogenation of p -CNB increases from 16.0 to 60.5 mol H 2 mol Pt \u22121 min \u22121 , and the selectivity to p -CAN also increases from 80.5 to 98.2%. However, the catalytic activity decreases sharply again and selectivity also decreases slightly when the molar ratio of Ce 3+ /Pt is higher than 0.06. We suspect that the effect of rare earth ions is related to the interaction of ions with support, reaction substrate, product or metallic catalyst. Further investigations are being done now. 4 Conclusions The addition of Sm 3+ , Ce 3+ and Pr 3+ to catalytic system improves the selectivity of p -CAN but have lower catalytic activity when PVP\u2013Pt is used alone. In the presence of NaOH, the hydrogenation rate of p -CNB and selectivity of p -CNB to p -CAN increases significantly for PVP\u2013RE\u2013Pt and PVP\u2013Pt catalysts. PVP\u2013Sm\u2013Pt catalyst exhibits the highest selectivity (95.8%) of p -CAN when the molar ratio of NaOH to substrate is 0.12. In the presence of other inorganic/organic base, such as KOH, n -Bu 3 N and Et 2 NH, the catalytic activity and selectivity of p -CAN also increase markedly for PVP\u2013Pt catalyst. High cross-linking PVP has strong coordinative ability with rare earth and Pt, which probably increases the catalytic activity. PVP\u2013Ce\u2013Pt \u2217 using PVP (90,000) as support exhibits the best activity (60.5 mol H 2 mol Pt \u22121 min \u22121 ) and selectivity of p -CAN (98.2%) in the presence of 4.8\u00d710 \u22124 mol NaOH. The amount of Ce 3+ in PVP\u2013Ce\u2013Pt \u2217 catalyst influences markedly the catalytic properties. Catalytic activity and selectivity of p -CAN are highest when the molar ratio of Ce 3+ /Pt is 0.06. References [1] R. Baltzly A.P. Phillips J. Am. Chem. Soc. 68 1946 261 [2] A.A.

CuO/CZB series of catalysts were also prepared for comparison. The catalytic activity of the PdOCZB and CuO/CZB series of catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation was investigated. A significant influence of the Ce 0.7 Zr 0.3 Ba 0.1 O 2.1 support on the catalytic performance has been found. Using Ce 0.7 Zr 0.3 Ba 0.1 O 2.1 as catalyst support increased the activity of CO oxidation and promoted the thermal stability significantly. It was found that the transition metal supported catalyst of 10.0 wt % CuO/CZB obtained a good result, as did the precious metal supported catalysts of 0.75 wt % PdO/CZB. The catalytic behaviors and thermal stability of PdO/CZB and CuO/CZB catalysts greatly depended on the support effect. The nature of Ce 0.7 Zr 0.3 Ba 0.1 O 2.1 support was also characterized by surface area (BET method), x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen (H 2 -TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technologies.",

Mo content, pretreatment conditions, space velocity, reaction temperature on the preformance of methane aromatization under oxygen-free conditions over HZSM-5 supported Mo catalyst has been studied, the effect of carbon deposition on catalyst after reaction and regeneration by carbon burning with O2 was investigated. It was found that the initial activity of catalysts prepared by grinding technique was higher than that of catalysts prepared by impregnating technique, but the activity of the former decreased quickly with reaction time increased, and decreased obviously after regeneration, while the activity of the latter was similar to that of fresh catalysts. The catalyst with Mo content of 3. 5%\ufffd\ufffd4. 0% showed the best aromatization activity. Decreasing space velocity and increasing reaction temperature improved the aromatization activity. With reaction time increased, the selectivity for ethylene enhanced while selectivity for benzene decreased. Furthermore, XPS results suggested that the most of Mo6+ in the catalysts prepared by impregnating method dispersed in the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite and those of grinding method dispersed on the surface of HZSM-5 zeolite, the carbon content on the catalyst surface increased rapidly, and Mo6+ in the ground catalysts was reduced to Mo0 after reaction for 4 h. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that molybdena carbene with configuration of MoO3 = CH2 is an initial product of methane aromatization reaction.",

The molecular H 2 was activated on the surface of the catalyst, and the activated hydrogen atom then reacted with CCl 4 in solution and produced chloroform. From this reaction mechanism, a definite kinetic equation could be deduced. The reaction rate coefficient is determined by initial concentration of CCl 4 in the solution, pressure, reaction temperature, and the concentration of active centers. All these factors were studied over Pt-Pd/C catalyst and fit in with the kinetic equation. From the experimental results, the activation energy of the reaction is 86 kJ/mol.",

        "abstract": "The adsorption and activation of CH 4 and CO 2 over the Ni/SiO 2 catalyst with different Ni particle sizes were investigated by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. CH x species ( x = 1\u20133) were observed over the catalysts when CH 4 was adsorbed on the surface. The CH 3 O species was also detected as the result of the reaction of CH x species with surface hydroxyl groups. The dissociation of CH 4 depended intensively on the Ni particle size. CH 4 dissociated more easily over the Ni/SiO 2 catalyst with Ni particles of diameter approximately 8 nm. Dissociation of CO 2 over Ni/SiO 2 was very difficult, whereas the adsorbed H that resulted from CH 4 dissociation promoted the dissociation of CO 2 . Small Ni particles might be helpful for hydrogen spillover to the support for CO 2 activation. With respect to the coadsorption of CH 4 and CO 2 , the monodentate carbonate species was observed over the Ni/SiO 2 catalyst with a small Ni particle size, which indicated that small Ni particles could promote the reaction of CO 2 with surface oxygen species.",

The effect of support on catalytic activity on oxidation of CO and methane has been studied. The activity of the supported Pd catalyst is much higher than that of the supported Pt catalyst. The catalytic activity depends on the nature of the support; the sequence for supported Pd and Pt catalyst being CeO2 > ZrO2 > Al2O3 For both CO and methane oxidation, Pd/CeO2 shows highest activity with a light-off temperature at 45\u00b0 and 310\u00b0C respectively, with no apparent decay. This is mostly due to the Superoxide species over CeO2 Pd/ZrO2, Pd/Al2O3, and Pt/CeO2 catalysts exhibit apparent deacti vation. The heat-stability of Pd/CeO2 is inferior to Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, but the oxidation activity of Pd/CeO2 catalyst for CO and methane is higher than that of Pd/Al2O3 after calcination at 1200\u00b0C for 4h.",

        "abstract": "The catalytic conversion of methane to high value liquid products has drawn much attention in the last few years. Results of methane activation by co-added propane over Zn/HZSM-5 were presented. The catalyst was prepared by impregnating a commercial HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al molar ratio = 50-70) with an aqueous solution of zinc acetate to yield 6% Zn/HZSM-5. After impregnation, the catalyst was dried at 120\u00b0C overnight and calcined in air at 400\u00b0C for 4 hr. The addition of propane into the methane feed gave a surprising promotion of the conversion of methane to aromatics over 6% Zn/HZSM-5. Although pure methane did not react at 600\u00b0C, methane could be efficiently converted with some propane added, e.g., the conversion of methane reached 25.8% when the methane to propane molar ratio was 1, and the conversion of methane was increased to 32.4% at the ratio of 0.6. The conversion of propane remained the same in both cases, while the selectivity for aromatics changed with the methane/propane molar ratio. Methane could be activated by propane addition.",

The effect of Ce-Mn-O powder with different Ce/Mn molar ratio on the catalytic activity and the cohesive ability of washcoat on the cordierite honeycomb substrate was also investigated. The structure and catalytic properties of Ce0.5Mn0.5O1.5 washcoat were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), differential thermal analysis and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TG/DTA), and N2 adsorption and desorption techniques. The results indicated that the Ce0.5Mn0.5O1.5 powder belongs to a novel washcoat with the advantages of strong cohesiveness, high surface area and without agglomeration even after 1000 C calcination. The total oxidation temperature for toluene, acetone and ethyl acetate over the 0.1 wt % Pd/Ce0.5Mn0.5O1.5/cordierite honeycomb catalysts was at 200, 220 and 220 C, respectively. Compaired with the catalysts without Ce0.5Mn0.5O1.5 washcoat, the catalyst with Ce0.5Mn0.5O1.5 as washcoat on the cordierite honeycomb could improve the dispersion of PdO and shows a good catalytic activity for toluene, acetone and ethyl acetate. \u00a9 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

CuO/CZB series of catalysts were also prepared for comparison. The catalytic activity of the PdOCZB and CuO/CZB series of catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation was investigated. A significant influence of the Ce0.7Zr0.3Ba0.1O2.1 support on the catalytic performance has been found. Using Ce0.7Zr 0.3Ba0.1O2.1 as catalyst support increased the activity of CO oxidation and promoted the thermal stability significantly. It was found that the transition metal supported catalyst of 10.0 wt % CuO/CZB obtained a good result, as did the precious metal supported catalysts of 0.75 wt % PdO/CZB. The catalytic behaviors and thermal stability of PdO/CZB and CuO/CZB catalysts greatly depended on the support effect. The nature of Ce 0.7Zr0.3Ba0.1O2.1 support was also characterized by surface area (BET method), x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technologies. \u00a9 2008 MAIK Nauka.",

It was found that small amounts of Pb doped Ni catalysts exhibited excellent coke resistance ability with minor loss of the reforming activity. As the added amount of Pb increased from 0 to 0.015 (mole ratio between Pb/Ni), coke formation rate decreased from 166.7\u00a0mg-coke/g-cat h (on Ni/SiO2) to 0, while the reforming activity decreased slightly from 73.2% to 63.3% (conversion of CO2) at 800 \u00b0C, 60,000\u00a0ml(STP)/g-cat\u00b7h (CH4 CO2=1:1, no dilution gas in feed). Higher amounts of Pb and Sb, Bi, Te made Ni catalyst deactivated for methane reforming with CO2.",

The redox behaviour of these catalysts was investigated by using H 2 -TPR and CO-TPR. The shape and temperature of TPR peaks depend on the nature of reducing agent. Two peaks (\u03b1 1 and \u03b3) were observed when H 2 was used as reducing agent for the fresh catalyst, while three peaks (\u03b1\u2032, \u03b2\u2032 and \u03b3\u2032) were observed when CO was used as a reducing agent. The addition of a noble metal effectively promotes the reduction of Ce 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 support, which is attributed to hydrogen spillover. After re-oxidation treatments, the PdO reduction process splits into two peaks (\u03b1 1 and \u03b1 2 ). On the basis of the catalytic activity and CO-TPR results, the activity of CO oxidation is related to the finely dispersed PdO, while the activity of methane oxidation is related to the large PdO particles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract SiO 2 , MCM-41 and activated carbon supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid (H 3 PW 12 O 40 , HPW) were used in the direct synthesis of dimethyldiphenylmethane (CH 3 C 6 H 4 CH 2 C 6 H 4 CH 3 , DMDPMs) from toluene and formaldehyde, and characterized by FT-IR, XRD and nitrogen adsorption. It was found that SiO 2 supported HPW exhibited higher activity and DMDPMs selectivity, and the yield of DMDPMs increased with the loading amount of HPW. The best yield of DMDPMs reached 61.3% when the loading of HPW increased to 60 wt.% on SiO 2 . FT-IR and XRD analysis indicated that HPW dispersed highly on the surface of these supports. Highly dispersed HPW exhibited higher activity (higher TON) than that of pure HPW. While MCM-41 suffered severe structural distortions when the loading amount of HPW is high. Keywords 12-Tungstophosphoric acid Dimethyldiphenylmethane Toluene Formaldehyde 1 Introduction Dimethyldiphenylmethane (CH 3 PhCH 2 PhCH 3 , DMDPMs) is an important chemical and intermediate in the production of spices, pharmaceutics and dielectric fluid. And diphenylmethane dyes (e.g. auramine, also called as Basic Yellow, such as NH:C[PhN(CH 3 ) 2 ] 2 ) are widely used in wool, paper, leather and silk industries [1] . Typically, DMDPMs is produced by the condensation of xylene with benzyl chloride in the presence of a Friedel\u2013Crafts catalyst such as aluminium chloride or iron chloride, which gives large amount of by-products such as polymers of benzyl chloride and several compounds having three or more benzene rings (Eq. (1) ) [2,3] . (1) CH 3 C 6 H 4 CH 3 + C 6 H 5 CH 2 Cl \u2192 CH 3 PhCH 2 PhCH 3 + HCl Several solid acid catalysts relevant to Friedel\u2013Crafts reactions had been reported in order to replace conventional problematic homogeneous catalysts, such as montmorillonite-supported transition metals, the graphite\u2013aluminum-chloride intercalate, modified alumina, transition-metal cations, sulphated zirconia, calcined nickel sulphate and clays [4\u201315] . But these catalysts had shown drawbacks such as lower selectivity, formation of higher amount of polyalkylated products and drastic reaction conditions [16] . In the past three decades, the use of heteropoly compounds (HPAs) in acid catalyzed reactions had opened new expectations for processes requiring acidities higher than those present on zeolites [17\u201319] . Previous work found that 12-tungstophosphoric acid exhibited good activity for the condensation of benzene and formaldehyde [20\u201322] , and high activity for the condensation of toluene and formaldehyde (Eq. (2) ) [23] . (2) 2C 6 H 5 CH 3 + HCHO \u2192 CH 3 PhCH 2 PhCH 3 + H 2 O This process is economical and environmental favorable as the only by-product is water. While the solid state heteropoly acids catalyst changed into a slurry state after reaction due to the formation of water, which brought difficulties in the following separation process and the loss of catalyst in the recycle usage [23] . In order to use HPAs as solid catalysts, it was desirable to support them on an appropriate carrier since the surface area of these materials was very small (<10 m 2 g \u22121 ). The high dispersed heteropoly acids on carriers with large surface area would increase the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites and enhance the efficiency of the catalyst. At the same time, the solid state catalyst was facile in separation process. The present contribution concerned the immobilization of 12-tungstophosphoric acid on SiO 2 , MCM-41 and activated carbon, and their utilization in the condensation of toluene and formaldehyde. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts 12-Tungstophosphoric acid (H 3 PW 12 O 40 , HPW) and SiO 2 were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. (China) and used directly without further treatment. Pure-silica MCM-41 was synthesized following a procedure as described in literature [24] . A commercial activated carbon (Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co.) was treated in 0.1 M HNO 3 , washed with water and dried at 130 \u00b0C for 3 h in vacuum before the catalyst preparation. SiO 2 , MCM-41 and activated carbon supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalysts with different loading amount were prepared by impregnation an equal volume adsorption (of support materials) of aqueous solution of HPW (with identified amount of HPW). The impregnated precursor was dried at 150 \u00b0C in vacuum for overnight and finally calcined at 300 \u00b0C in nitrogen for 3 h. 2.2 Characterizations The primary structure of the supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalysts were detected by means of FT-IR spectroscopy in a Nikolet 560 apparatus (USA). Samples were prepared by compressing a well mixed 3 mg of catalysts powder with 200 mg of potassium bromide (KBr). The structure of the carriers and the prepared catalysts were measured by nitrogen adsorption at \u2212196 \u00b0C using an OMNISORP 100CX system (COULTER Co., USA). All samples were pretreated at 250 \u00b0C in high vacuum, and the pore structure was calculated from the adsorption isotherm. Pore size (diameter) distribution in the range of 0.55\u20131.8 nm was calculated by the Horvath\u2013Kawazoe method and pore size in the range of 3.0\u2013100.0 nm was calculated by the Barret\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda method. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained with X-ray diffractometer in a D8 ADVANCE (BRUKER, Germany) equipment using nickel-filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Diffraction data were recorded using continuous scanning with a rate of 0.01\u00b0/s. 2.3 Catalytic reaction A custom-designed 150 cm 3 stainless autoclave (Lanzhou, China) was employed in this study. The mixture of toluene (450 mmol), paraformaldehyde (90 mmol of HCHO) and nitrobenzene (20 mmol, internal standard) was poured into the catalyst. The suspension was vigorously stirred with a magnetic stirrer. After reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature, solid catalyst was separated by centrifuging, the organic reactant solution was diluted with ethanol and analyzed using an FID gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry equipped with a 25 m capillary column of a cross-linked 5% phenylmethylsilicone (HP5988A, USA). 4,4\u2032-Dimethyldiphenylmethane (4,4\u2032-DMDPM) was confirmed with the standard mass spectrum in database and that of the standard products purchased from TCI (Beijing Branch, China). 2,2\u2032-Dimethyldiphenylmethane (2,2\u2032-DMDPM), 2,4\u2032-dimethyldiphenylmethane (2,4\u2032-DMDPM) and three-benzene-ring products (3-rings) were confirmed with the standard mass spectrum in database. And the amount of dimethyldiphenylmethanes was calculated on the basis of external standard (commercial 4,4\u2032-DMDPM). The selectivity of the dimethyldiphenylmethanes was calculated on the basis of HCHO according to the following equations: mol \u2009 of \u2009 DMDPM total \u2009 mol \u2009 of \u2009 DMDPMs + 2 \u00d7 mol \u2009 of \u2009 three \u2009 ring \u2009 products \u00d7 100 % . In this contribution, the mass balance calculated on the basis of HCHO lying in 96\u2013100%. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterizations of supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalysts The IR spectrum of the SiO 2 and MCM-41 supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalysts are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . Pure 12-tungstophosphoric acid exhibited the typical IR bands at vas (P\u2013O a ) = 1080 cm \u22121 , vas (W = O d ) = 982 cm \u22121 , vas (W\u2013O b \u2013W) = 890 cm \u22121 and vas (W\u2013O c \u2013W) = 810 cm \u22121 asymmetric vibrations associated to the Keggin ions, where a \u2013 d designated specific positions of the oxygen atoms in the Keggin structure, namely, P\u2013O a \u2013W, W\u2013O b \u2013W and W\u2013O c \u2013W connecting two W 3 O 13 units by corner sharing and edge sharing, O d = W [25] . In SiO 2 supported catalysts, apart from the detected intensity of asymmetric vibrations of W\u2013O b \u2013W increased slightly with the loading amount of HPW, other three adsorption peaks of HPW acid changed slightly due to the overlapped vibrations peaks of HPW to those of SiO 2 ( Fig. 1 ). No clear adsorption peak of HPW could be identified on MCM-41 support ( Fig. 2 ). These results indicated that 12-tungstophosphoric acid dispersed highly on the surface of SiO 2 and MCM-41. Fig. 3 shows the XRD spectrum of SiO 2 supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid with different loading amount. It could be found that no diffraction peak of 12-tungstophosphoric acid was detected when the loading amount less than 0.25 g/g-support. After this point, the diffraction peaks of 12-tungstophosphoric acid became obvious. Similar results were also detected in MCM-41 and activated carbon supported catalysts ( Fig. 4 ). These results indicating that the primary structure of 12-tungstophosphoric acid was preserved even at high loading amount. Fig. 5 illustrated the XRD spectrum of the fresh MCM-41 and MCM-41 supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalyst (0.6 g/g-support). Fresh MCM-41 exhibited a strong reflection at high d 1 0 0 -spacing (ca. 3.5 nm) and a few weak peaks at higher angles with corresponding d-spacing in the range ca. 2.3\u20131.5 nm. While in MCM-41 supported catalyst, 12-tungstophosphoric acid had a striking effect on the width and intensity of the main reflection at high d 1 0 0 -spacing and this line became broader and weaker. This suggested that the long-range order of MCM-41 was decreased noticeably by the presence of 12-tungstophosphoric acid. There is increased disorder within the pores following deposition of HPW crystallites. The surface area of pure 12-tungstophosphoric acid, SiO 2 , MCM-41, activated carbon and the supported catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The average pore diameter of SiO 2 , MCM-41 and activated carbon were 10.2, 3.0 and 1.0 nm, respectively. Pure 12-tungstophosphoric acid possesses a limited surface (<10.0 m 2 /g), small pore volume (0.02 cm 3 /g) and large interparticles average pore diameter (3.7 nm). This interparticles pore of 12-tungstophosphoric acid also appeared on MCM-41 and activated carbon supported catalysts (3.7 nm diameter), while the main pore diameter of these carriers remained, which inferred that big 12-tungstophosphoric acid particles might form on the surface of MCM-41 and activated carbon ( Fig. 6 ). Only one unique pore (ca. 9.6 nm) was detected in SiO 2 supported catalyst, and its diameter is smaller than that of pure SiO 2 (ca. 10.2 nm, Table 1 ). This indicated that 12-tungstophosphoric acid were immobilized in the channels of SiO 2 and fully dispersed in a monolayer on SiO 2 surface [26] . On the another hand, micropores (0.6 nm) appeared in MCM-41 supported catalyst, while surface area of HPW/MCM-41 remains relatively high, it might be increased disorder within the pores following deposition of HPW crystallites. The adsorption isotherms of MCM-41 and HPW/MCM-41 also confirmed this increased disorder within the pores ( Fig. 7 ). The micropores of the activated carbons (ca. 1.0 nm) were in the majority. This kind of micropore was too narrow to accommodate a 12-tungstophosphoric acid molecule (diameter is 1.2 nm). It can also be found that the surface area of supported catalysts (with 0.6 g loading amount of HPW) decreased obviously compared with the pure carriers. And we thought that there might be a progressive decrease in surface area with the increasing loading amount of HPW. 3.2 DMDPMs synthesis over 12-tungstophosphoric acid The catalytic performance of 12-tungstophosphoric acid for directly synthesis of DMDPMs via the condensation of toluene and formaldehyde are summarized in Table 2 . Manily 4,4\u2032-DMDPM (with a selectivity of 51.2\u201365.3%) and 2,4\u2032-DMDPM (with a selectivity of 29.7\u201338.9%) was detected in the reaction mixture. It could be found that the conversion of HCHO increased from 26.9 to 80.1% with the added amounts of 12-tungstophosphoric acid increased from 0.1 to 0.5 g. While the selectivity of total DMDPMs decreased slightly from 96.3 to 89.9% and the selectivity of 3-rings products increased with increasing conversion of HCHO. That is, higher amount of catalyst was helpful for the conversion of HCHO, but it would catalyze the consecutive reaction of formed by-product. The calculated TON value (turnover numbers, defined as (mole of reacted HCHO)/(mole of protons in catalyst)) decreased slightly from 232.8 to 141.9 with the amount of catalyst from 0.1 to 0.5 g. 3.3 DMDPMs synthesis on supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalysts The activity of SiO 2 , MCM-41 and activated carbon supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalysts with different loading amounts are summarized in Tables 3\u20135 . On SiO 2 supported catalysts, the conversion of HCHO increased obviously from 23.6 to 75.8% with the loading amount of 12-tungstophosphoric acid and the selectivity of total DMDPMs decreased from 90.0 to 80.9%. Though the calculated TON decreased from 469.1 to 174.6 with the increase of loading amount of HPW, these data are higher than that of unsupported 12-tungstophosphoric acid at the same amount. We think that the increased TON of H + on SiO 2 supported catalysts is due to the highly dispersion of 12-tungstophosphoric acid and the highly dispersed proton increased the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites and enhance the efficiency of the catalyst. This allowed us to conclude that on SiO 2 support 12-tungstophosphoric acid was molecularly dispersed and retained their protons without modification of their strength and were immobilized in the channels by weak interaction with the walls, presumably by hydrogen bonding with silanol groups as suggested in ref. [27] . But the negative effect of these immobilized 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalysts is that they enhanced the formation of 3-rings products due to the consecutive electrophilic attacks to the DMDPMs. On MCM-41 supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalysts, the conversion of HCHO increased quickly from 29.3 to 67.0% with the loading amount of HPW raised from 0.05 to 0.25 g, and then increased slightly. The selectivity of total DMDPMs decreased slightly with the loading amount of HPW increased. The calculated TON of H + in MCM-41 supported catalysts are also higher than that of unsupported 12-tungstophosphoric acid at the same amount. Though the surface area of MCM-41 (1064.5 m 2 /g) is several times higher than that of SiO 2 (324.7 m 2 /g, Table 1 ), 12-tungstophosphoric acid supported on MCM-41 did not exhibit any predominance compared to SiO 2 . We thought that this might be due to the poor stability of the MCM-41. That is, the long-range order meso-porous MCM-41 was destroyed in some extent and there is increased disorder within the pores during the impregnation step as the strong acidity of the aqueous solution of 12-tungstophosphoric acid. The activity of activated carbon supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid was poor for the synthesis of DMDPMs directly from toluene and HCHO. The detected conversion of HCHO and TON were even lower than that of unsupported 12-tungstophosphoric acid. Previous work found that the condensation between toluene and HCHO to DMPMs involves two consecutive electrophonic attacks to an aromatic ring and both of these attacks need to be catalyzed by acid catalysts, and only strong acid sites are active [23] . While the 12-tungstophosphoric acid adsorbed strongly on activated carbon, and the adsorption was believed to involve proton transfer from the HPW to the carbon [28] . As a result the acid strength of 12-tungstophosphoric acid supported on active carbon was weaker than that of pure 12-tungstophosphoric acid. 4 Conclusion As a conclusion, we found that 12-tungstophosphoric acid could be dispersed highly on the surface of SiO 2 and MCM-41. These supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalysts are facile in separation and would increase the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites in the condensation of toluene and formaldehyde. SiO 2 and MCM-41 supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid catalysts exhibited higher activity than that of unsupported 12-tungstophosphoric acid. The best yield of total DMDPMs reached 61.3% on SiO 2 supported HPW (with 0.6 g loading amount of HPW). While the main drawback of MCM-41 supported catalysts is that the long-range order meso-porous MCM-41 was destroyed in some extent during the impregnation step as the strong acidity of the aqueous solution of 12-tungstophosphoric acid. And active carbon supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid showed a low activity for this reaction due to the decreased acidity.

Abstract Carbon deposition on Ni-based catalysts has a significant influence on their cracking activity and selectivity and is the main reason for catalyst deactivation. To understand this behavior, pulse techniques and in situ infrared spectroscopic analysis were applied to the study of the surface carbonaceous species formation and transformation over Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 , Ni/MgO/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 and Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 . It was found that MgAl 2 O 4 allows an effective way for CO 2 adsorption and activation through the formation of formate/carbonate type species. Carbon adspecies, mainly as CH x ( x = 1\u20133), are the intermediates of methane activation on Ni particles and preferably diffuse from the metal to the interference of Ni and the supports and promote the adsorbed CO 2 species to decompose and release CO through formate/carbonate type intermediates. The mechanism proposed emphasis the role of these surface species in the surface chemistry of carbonaceous reaction. The data obtained led to a satisfactory description of the working catalyst. Keywords Coke Ni catalyst Carbon dioxide Methane reforming FTIR 1 Introduction The formation of coke deposits leading to catalyst deactivation has been a challenge for catalytic technology in many hydrocarbon processes. The indirect and direct conversion of nature gas both on oxidative and non-oxidative conditions are examples of such developments [1] . In these cases, the effective management of catalyst deactivation and catalyst regeneration is the key in many heterogeneously catalyzed processes. The optimization of such complex processes requires the characterization of the coke formation process and its reactivity in order to understand the effect of the operational variables on these deposits and, therefore, minimize its accumulation and develop effective regeneration strategies. Several characterization techniques [2] , such as temperature-programmed oxidation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, have been used to study coke deposits and to obtain information regarding the deactivation mechanism and regeneration conditions. Previously, we used temperature-programmed reaction techniques and Raman spectroscopy to characterize coke species deposited on a 5%Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst [3] , which exhibits high activity and significant stability during dry reforming of methane [4,5] . It was found that two main properties of a catalyst affect the carbon deposition: surface structure and surface acidity. The nature and quantity of the coke is strongly dependant on the composition of the reacting feed, reaction time and temperature. There are three carbon species (i.e., C \u03b1 , C \u03b2 and C \u03b3 ) on the catalyst surface, in which C \u03b3 was graphite-like carbon species and was responsible for catalyst deactivation. The nature of the carbon species can also be classified as polymeric, filamentous, and graphitic [6] . Polymeric coke is supposed to be derived from thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, whereas the filamentous and graphitic forms of coke are formed on the catalyst. Coke can also be characterized based on its reactivity with hydrogen, water and oxygen. Although these are gross properties that do not provide detailed chemical information, they are closely related to the actual reaction conditions. Although coke characterization has been included in many papers, there are still some disputations about the accurate mechanism details. Different surface species on Ni catalysts were also identified on different supports. In situ diffuse reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) revealed that CH x can react with OH species from the support, and CH x O species were formed on TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 -supported transition metals [1,7] . While on La 2 O 3 supported transition metals, oxycarbonates were found to be the main intermediate [8,9] . Further, it is argued that the CO 2 was activated on support or Ni particles are also involved. In the present study, the bulk structure of surface carbonaceous species and its reactivity with various gases were further investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), pulse experiments and in situ DRIFTS. Emphasizes was placed on the surface species formation and transformation on the catalysts during dry reforming reactions. The satisfactory description of the coking activity and a possible role in hydrocarbon conversion reactions was proposed in the light of the results obtained. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst characterization Magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl 2 O 4 ) was prepared in a similar way to previous studies [4] . Stoichiometric quantities of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O and Al(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O were dissolved separately in distilled water. The resulting solutions and an aqueous solution of ammonia were dropped into a flask at the same time with constant stirring to maintain the pH value at about 9.5. The precipitate was continuously stirred for an hour and then aged overnight. After being thoroughly washed with distilled water for several times, the resulting slurry was then dried at 120 \u00b0C for 15 h and calcined at 800 \u00b0C for 8 h in air. Supported nickel catalyst was prepared by conventional wet impregnation, using nitrate salt as the precursor. A given amount of nickel nitrate solution was placed in a 100 ml beaker, the appropriate amount of MgAl 2 O 4 or \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 was added under continuous stirring. The slurry was dried at 120 \u00b0C over night and calcined at 550 \u00b0C under air for 5 h. 2.2 Catalytic testing The CO 2 reforming of methane was carried out at 750 \u00b0C and atmospheric pressure, using 20 mg catalyst (unless otherwise mentioned) in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (ca. 4 mm i.d.). Activation of the Ni-catalyst involved reductive treatment with hydrogen at 750 \u00b0C for 60 min. The reactant feed was CH 4 :CO 2 = 1:1 and a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The exit gases were analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD, using a TDX-01 column. The conversions and selectivity were calculated on the basis of the reforming reaction and the water\u2013gas shift reaction [10] . Pulse reactions were performed in a conventional flow system with a flow measuring and control system, a mixing chamber, and a fixed-bed quartz reactor (4 mm i.d., 200 mm length), which was placed in an electric oven. Before reaction, the catalysts were reduced in situ at 750 \u00b0C for 60 min in H 2 flow. Before the pulse data were obtained, the catalyst was treated in situ at 750 \u00b0C for 30 min in flowing Ar. The reactant was introduced with a 6-port gas sampling valve under a stream of Ar carrier gas. Analysis of the gases during the pulsed reactions was done by an on-line quadrupole mass spectrometer (OmniStar GSD 301), which scanned peaks of the following eight compounds: H 2 , CH 4 , 13 CH 4 , H 2 O, CO, 13 CO, CO 2 , 13 CO 2 within 1 s. 2.3 Catalyst characterization The crystal structure of catalysts before and after reaction was determined by XRD in a Rigaku D/max-IIIB apparatus using Cu K \u03b11 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.54056 \u00c5), at 45 kV and 40 mA. Diffraction peaks recorded in a 2 \u03b8 range between 20\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 have been used to identify the structure of the samples. The apparent crystallite size was determined using the Scherrer formula with standard procedure [11] . Nickel dispersion was determined by H 2 chemisorption at room temperature in a pulse experimental apparatus. The catalyst was reduced by H 2 at 750 \u00b0C for 2 h. Then the temperature was decreased to 100 \u00b0C under Ar, kept there for 20 min, and then further decreased to room temperature for the in situ H 2 chemisorption measurements. The quantity of H 2 adsorbed at monolayer coverage and the mean particle sizes of Ni were obtained by a standard procedure [12] . 2.4 In situ DRIFTS DRIFTS experiments were performed on a Nicolet 740 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an in situ DRIFTS cell with KBr windows. The cell was cooled by water circulating, which allowed collection of spectra over the temperature range between 25 \u00b0C and 700 \u00b0C at atmospheric pressure. The interaction of CO 2 , CH 4 or the reaction mixture with both the support and the catalyst was studied. In all cases, the sample was reduced under a flowing H 2 /He mixture for 2 h and purged with He for additional 0.5 h at 700 \u00b0C. Then a flow of CH 4 /He, CO 2 /He or the reaction mixture was introduced into the DRIFTS cell. The spectra of the adsorbed specie were obtained by subtraction of the initial spectrum registered after the reduction step. For all the spectra recorded, a 32-scan data accumulation was carried out at a resolution of 4 cm \u22121 . 3 Results 3.1 Catalyst characterization and catalytic performance The XRD patterns of MgAl 2 O 4 supported Ni catalysts were quite simple [4] . The diffraction lines of Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst virtually coincided with those of the as-prepared MgAl 2 O 4 support and no other lines of Ni-containing species were discerned. However, NiO diffraction lines were depicted with the Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 and Ni/MgO\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts. This implies that the NiO in the as-prepared Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalysts was finely dispersed (with a dispersion of 16%, Table 1 ), which could be responsible for the higher stability and lower carbon deposition of the Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst in dry reforming of methane. The mean nickel particle sizes estimated by employing Scherrer's equation following the standard procedures are of the order of 10.4 nm and 11.8 nm before and after 10 h on stream as indicated in Table 1 . These are in accordance with values derived from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results ( Table 1 ), in which the Ni 0 particle size increased from 8.8 nm to 10.1 nm. This indicates that Ni particle sintering occurs under the reaction conditions. Sintering is an important route for the deactivation of Ni-based dry reforming catalysts. However, the particle size only increased about 15% in the first 10 h and this did not induce deactivation, as demonstrated in Table 1 . This is because the catalyst can produce a highly dispersed active phase and a large active surface area as bound-state Ni species after pre-reduction. In contrast, the Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalyst has a relatively lower Ni dispersion and sintered severely during the reaction (the particle size increased about 300% as indicated in Table 1 ). This implies that a proper interaction exists between Ni and MgAl 2 O 4 , which contribute to the high dispersion of Ni and inhibit the sintering of Ni particles, as has been discussed [4] . We have studied the activity and stability of the as-prepared catalysts in differential condition. As shown in Table 1 , Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 gives superior high activity than Ni/Al 2 O 3 toward dry reforming of methane. The ratio of H 2 /CO obtained under the stated conditions was found to vary between 0.78 and 1.01 for Ni/Al 2 O 3 and Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 , respectively. Long-term stability tests indicate that the activity of Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst remained unchanged over 55 h on stream, while Ni/Al2O3 deactivated quickly in 10 h [4,5] . It has been established that the primary reason for deactivation of Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 can be generally attributed to carbon deposition on the Ni crystallites. As also shown in Table 1 , the amount of coke reached about 14.5 wt% on Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 , while only 1.2% was found on Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 after 10 min on stream. With the time on stream, it was found that the coking rate decreased on both catalysts, but Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 deactivated quickly owing to the large amount of coke accumulation, which plugs the reactor in around 10 h [4,5] . 3.2 Surface active carbonaceous species Although most researchers agree that carbon formation is the primary reason for the catalyst deactivation, disagreement exists on the source of the carbon. In our previous study [3] , the amount of coke species deposited from CO disproportionation was found to be too small compared to CH 4 decomposition and was negligible during dry reforming of methane on Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 , which suggested that the main source of coke during the reaction was originated from CH 4 decomposition. The nature of these carbon species was further studied by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT), which was shown in Fig. 1 . When a large amount of methane was introduced, the intense gaseous CH 4 adsorption at 2900\u20133050 cm \u22121 appeared. While no CH x species was observed under the reaction conditions even at 500 \u00b0C (not shown). As a result, it hardly detect CH x ( x = 1\u20133) species even though CH x species was widely accepted as an intermediate species for methane activation during CO 2 reforming of methane. It should be noted that the concentration of a species on the surface depends on its formation and conversion rates. The importance of a surface species in a catalytic cycle cannot be simply determined by its surface concentration or coverage. Many research groups have evidenced the existence of CH x species by CD 4 /H 2 and CH 4 /D 2 isotopic transient reactions [13] and pulsed surface reaction analysis [14] . Indeed, a detailed spectrum of the C\u2013H bands can be obtained after flushing the reacting gas phase with argon after 10 min on stream. Although weak and poorly resolved, the main bands around 2966 cm \u22121 , 2906 cm \u22121 , and 2871 cm \u22121 can be assigned to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of \u2013CH 3 and CH 2 species. A weak shoulder at around 2890 cm \u22121 also suggests the presence of some CH groups [15] . In situ oxidation of the reacted sample was carried out subsequently. The CH x bands described above disappeared, restoring the reference spectrum after 5 min. 3.3 Transient response reactions Two sequences of pulsed reactions were conducted over Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 and Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalysts. Fig. 2 shows responses to 13 CH 4 pulse into 10% 12 CO 2 /Ar steady flow with Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 and Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 at 750 \u00b0C. Signals of 12 CO 2 were omitted from the profile. When 13 CH 4 was introduced, H 2 , 13 CO, 12 CO and 13 CO 2 were generated immediately on Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 and the signals of 12 CO and 13 CO 2 reached a maximum at about 4 s later than those of 13 CO and H 2 . This indicates that CO 2 and CH 4 were activated separately. The reaction process is likely preceded by rapid hydrogen abstraction from CH 4 to give adsorbed CH x and H species, followed by a slow reaction of CO 2 with adsorbed CH x species. The adsorbed H may assist CO 2 dissociation on both Ni and support surface since generation of 12 CO was also improved by 13 CH 4 introduction, as reported by Osaka over various catalysts [16] . After 13 CH 4 pulse passed through the catalyst bed, H 2 , 13 CO, 12 CO and a very small amount of 13 CO 2 were continued to evolve. Similar results were observed over Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. While the conversion of CH 4 was much lower over Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 than that over Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 . This may be due to a lower dispersion of the active metal species on Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalyst [4] . Fig. 3 shows responses to pulsing CO 2 into 10% CH 4 /Ar steady flow over Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 and Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. In this case, surface carbonaceous species (i.e., \u2013CH 3 , CH 2 and CH) were formed previously and continuous during the pulse reaction. When CO 2 was introduced, formation of CO was detected immediately over Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 , indicating of rapid CO 2 dissociation over Ni and MgAl 2 O 4 perimeter. H 2 response started to reinforce after a few seconds. CO and H 2 continued to appear after CO 2 passed through the catalyst bed. When the same reaction was conducted on Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 , only very small amount of CO 2 reacted and a small amount of H 2 and CO produced. This is due to the very weak adsorption of CO 2 on \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 , unlike the case on MgAl 2 O 4 support, where CO 2 is able to be concentrated after CO 2 pulses. Large amount of CH x species were formed on both catalysts under CH 4 steady flow. But due to the weaker activation of CO 2 on Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 , the reaction of CO 2 with CH x occurred more slowly and the response of CO was very weak as compared to that of Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 . 3.4 DRIFTS DRIFTS experiments were conducted in CH 4 , CO 2 or CH 4 /CO 2 gas flows at 680 \u00b0C with the objective of identifying the adsorbed carbonaceous species under reaction conditions. Experiments were also conducted where changes in the IR spectrum were monitored in response to changes in the gas phase mixture induced by substituting the reactant mixture by diluted methane or carbon dioxide. 3.4.1 Surface active species on catalyst supports DRIFTS of the MgAl 2 O 4 support and the Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst after adsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 /CO 2 mixture are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 separately. Apart from the gas phase contributions of CO 2 centered ca. 2349 cm \u22121 , 13 CO 2 centered ca. 2275 cm \u22121 or CH 4 at 1305 cm \u22121 and 3015 cm \u22121 , several bands in the region between 1200 cm \u22121 and 1600 cm \u22121 became apparent. On the support (in Fig. 4 ), two well-defined bands centered at 1500 cm \u22121 and 1293 cm \u22121 are observed after introduction of CO 2 . The IR intensities of these two bands increase with increasing temperature and time on stream. These bands could be attributed to the carbonate type species adsorbed on the support at high temperature [17] . In addition, two shoulder bands centered at 1580 cm \u22121 and 1400 cm \u22121 also appeared and followed the same trends as carbonate species. These two bands can be assigned to asymmetric C\u2013O and H\u2013C\u2013O stretching of adsorbed HCO 2 \u2212 [18] . Isolated O\u2013H stretching mode of alumina hydroxyl was apparent at 3609 cm \u22121 . Meanwhile, three well-defined bands centered at 3726 cm \u22121 , 3702 cm \u22121 and 3618 cm \u22121 were appeared after CO 2 introduction due to the Fermi resonance of linearly adsorbed CO 2 [19] . DRIFTS of the hydrogen-treated support after exposure to the reacting mixture at 680 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 5 . When methane was introduced into the reacting mixture, the intensity of the band around 1500 cm \u22121 was reduced. After methane introduction, bands at 2170 cm \u22121 and 2115 cm \u22121 were observed and can be assigned to gaseous CO. The intensity of gaseous CO decreased with time on stream and reached a constant value after 30 min. It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the intensity of gaseous CO and carbonate species did not change as a function of time on stream after introduction of CH 4 for 30 min. 3.4.2 Surface active species on catalysts In another experiments, Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 was reduced in situ at 700 \u00b0C for 1 h in flowing hydrogen. After purging with Ar for 30 min, the gas flow was switched to 10%CO 2 + Ar or 10%CH 4 + 10%CO 2 + Ar. The surface species were also monitored by DRIFTS, and the results are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . Over Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 , similar tendencies were observed as on MgAl 2 O 4 after introduction of CO 2 ( Fig. 6 ). The adsorbed formate (bands at ca. 1410 cm \u22121 and 1551 cm \u22121 ) and carbonate (bands at ca. 1501 cm \u22121 and 1291 cm \u22121 ) species appeared after 2 min of CO 2 introduction and its intensity increased with time on stream. In CH 4 \u2013CO 2 co-feeding conditions, large amount of formate ( \u03bd s,c o = 1367 cm \u22121 , \u03bd a s,c o = 1551 cm \u22121 ) and carbonate ( \u03bd a s,c o = 1640 cm \u22121 , \u03bd s,c o = 1432 cm \u22121 , 1281 cm \u22121 , \u03b4 C\u2013O = 1230 cm \u22121 ) species were formed. Efstathiou et al. [20] found that the formate species on Al 2 O 3 surface was stable under CH 4 /CO 2 reforming condition even at 500\u2013600 \u00b0C. In the present study, the formate species formed were quite similar to those over Al 2 O 3 . The intensity of these bands indicated that the presence of CH x , i.e., adsorbed H species, favors the formation of formate species first. With the increase of temperature to above 600 \u00b0C, the adsorption of formate species weakened, while the intensity of carbonate species (at 1510 cm \u22121 and 1281 cm \u22121 ) increased accordingly. Over these catalysts, the formate species may transformed to carbonate species under a higher temperature. From the above experiments, no adsorbed CO and CH x species were observed by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Kroll et al. [21] observed intense band, due to linear and multi-bonded CO species, developed at 2012 cm \u22121 and 1855 cm \u22121 , respectively after introduction of the reaction mixture on Ni/SiO 2 catalyst at 500 \u00b0C. The lack of IR bands corresponding to adsorbed CO in the spectra of our samples suggests that the rate of desorption is greater than its formation at 680 \u00b0C. 4 Discussion One of the major problems encountered in the activation of hydrocarbons over metal catalysts is the rapid accumulation of coke, which leads to blocking the active sites and deactivating the catalyst activity. However, in contrast to 5%Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst which exhibit rapid deactivation during CO 2 reforming of methane, no deactivation was observed during 55 h on stream over a 5%Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst [4] . In the 5%Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, Ni dispersion is very low. Based on the H 2 adsorption experiments, the Ni 0 average particle size of 5%Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is of the order of 110 nm, which are approximately 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of 5%Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst. TEM showed that the Ni 0 average particle size of 5%Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 was 8.8 nm, which was in agreement with the measurements from H 2 adsorption results and XRD results. In any event, the three techniques applied show that the Ni particle size is small on the MgAl 2 O 4 support. After on stream for 10 h, the Ni particle size increased by only 13% over Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 , compared to approximately 300% of Ni/Al 2 O 3 . As have been reported [4] , the particle size of MgAl 2 O 4 was only 8.9 nm by XRD, which is comparable to 10.4 nm of the Ni particles. A nanocomposite catalyst may be formed between MgAl 2 O 4 and size-comparable Ni-metal nanocrystals. The unusual interactions between these nanocomposite catalysts may contribute to the high dispersion of active metals and extremely stable catalysis [22] . The active oxygen species have important impact on the inhibition of inert carbonaceous species formation. An \u201coxygen pool\u201d was proposed to be formed on the catalyst surface during CO 2 decomposition [23] . This causes the decreasing of CO 2 conversion and formation of CO 2 instead of CO when reacted with surface CH x species. Fig. 2 of present study 13 CO 2 was observed over both Ni/Al 2 O 3 and Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 after pulsing 13 CH 4 into 10%CO 2 /Ar steady flow. Over Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 , 13 CO 2 continued to evolve after 13 CH 4 pulse passed through the catalyst bed, while this is not observed over Ni/Al 2 O 3 . These results indicate that the following reactions occurred over these catalysts: (1) 13 CH 4 (a)\u2013Ni 0 \u2192 13 CH x \u2013Ni 0 + H 2 (g) rapid (2) H\u2013Ni 0 + 12 CO 2 \u2013MgAl 2 O 4 \u2192 OH\u2013MgAl 2 O 4 + 12 CO\u2013Ni 0 rapid (3) 12 CO 2 (a)\u2013MgAl 2 O 4 + 13 CH x \u2013Ni 0 \u2192 12 CO(g) + 13 CO(g) + ( x /2)H 2 (g) + Ni 0 \u2013MgAl 2 O 4 slow This implies that \u201coxygen pool\u201d did form over these two catalysts in a large amount of CO 2 , and this is so prominent over Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 than over Ni/Al 2 O 3 . In the FTIR spectra, both MgAl 2 O 4 and Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 in the presence of CO 2 displayed several intense bands in the 1600\u20131300 cm \u22121 region, which can be assigned to carbonate/bicarbonate type species. These adsorption bands were depressed largely by the introduction of CH 4 subsequently. CH x species formation was conformed also by FTIR experiments in Fig. 1 . During the reaction, CO 2 may rapidly react with MgAl 2 O 4 to generate carbonate/bicarbonate type species, which in turn reacts slowly with the CH x species to generate the other main products, H 2 and CO. This slow reaction occurs most likely at the metal/support interface. As indicated in Fig. 5 , there established a steady state between the surface carbonate species and the gaseous CO production when CH 4 was introduced to carbonate/bicarbonate type species covered catalyst. The presence of MgAl 2 O 4 may promote the adsorption of CO 2 and formation of carbonate intermediate. The formation and reaction equilibrium of carbonate/bicarbonate type species sustained the high activity of Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst. On the other hand, Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 and Ni/Al 2 O 3 give similar response to CO 2 pulse into 10%CH 4 /Ar. CO was detected immediately when CO 2 was introduced. Interestingly, H 2 was started to appear after a few seconds. This implies that CO 2 was firstly adsorbed on the support and dissociated into gaseous CO and adsorbed O species, which in turn reacted with surface CH x to release CO: (4) CO 2 \u2013MgAl 2 O 4 + Ni 0 \u2192 CO(g) + O x \u2013Ni rapid (5) Ni 0 \u2013CH x + Ni 0 \u2212 O x \u2192 CO(g) + H 2 (g) + 2Ni 0 slow The continuous formation of CO and H 2 evidenced this assumption. The exact form and properties of this \u201coxygen pool\u201d were not clearly elucidated until now although it was proposed the possible form of adsorbed oxygen, hydroxide or carbonate. Ferreira-Aparicio et al. [24] found that the carbonate type species, when CH 4 was introduced to the reactant flow, decreased and is replaced by adsorbed formate species, which were depleted after carbon dioxide is removed from the mixture. Different trends were observed over our catalysts. As illustrated in Figs. 3 and 6 , adsorption of CO 2 over the support or catalyst produced large amount of formate species, which can be enhanced by CH 4 introduction ( Figs. 5 and 7 ). This implies that these species can transform from one to another. This requires the participation of mobile oxygen species and hydrogen species. Surface hydroxyl groups (surface hydroxide or HCO 3 ) on the support may serve as carriers that allow mobility of these species. As for alumina-based support, this can be carried out through surface hydroxyl group over Al: (6) 4Al\u2013OH + 2CO \u2194 2Al\u2013O\u2013COOH + Al\u2013O\u2013Al + H 2 O (7) 2Al\u2013OH + CO \u2194 Al\u2013O\u2013CO\u2013O\u2013Al + H 2 O A few papers have been published in which oxycarbonates were detected in both Ru and Ni catalysts supported on La 2 O 3 [8] . These authors concluded that the formation of oxycarbonates during reaction plays a central role in the CO 2 reforming of methane. But this was seldom addressed in the catalyst when using aluminum-based supports. This could be ascribed to the weak adsorption of CO 2 on these compounds. When MgO was introduced into \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 surface, the adsorption of CO 2 was enhanced and the specific role of carbonate species was further elucidated in our samples. The temperature-programmed oxidation, temperature-programmed hydrogenation and temperature-programmed CO 2 reaction profiles showed that there were three carbon species (i.e., C \u03b1 , C \u03b2 and C \u03b3 ) on Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 surface [3] . C \u03b3 was responsible for catalyst deactivation. The C \u03b3 species was found to be the most inactive species toward H 2 and O 2 . In contrast, the C \u03b3 species was unexpectedly more active toward CO 2 than C \u03b1 and C \u03b2 on Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 surface. The unique reactivity of CO 2 with different coke species could be ascribed to the carbonate, bidentate and formate species formation on MgAl 2 O 4 surface. These surface species enhanced the oxidation of C \u03b3 and thus contributed to the high stability of Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst. In the dry reforming conditions with a high temperature, the surface hydroxyl groups desorbed easily, and CO 2 decomposition was depressed. In the present study, when CO 2 was adsorbed on the support, no CO was formed except carbonate species was observed by FTIR in Fig. 6 . These conclusions may find support in the literature. Bitter et al. [25] have suggested that Pt/ZrO 2 catalysts are not efficient for dry reforming of methane when formation of carbonates is not possible. Recently, Zhang et al. [26] also found that La 2 O 2 CO 3 and formate species may participate in the surface chemistry to produce synthesis gas over a high stable Ni/La 2 O 3 catalyst. From the above proposed mechanism, the formation of carbonate and formate type species is also an important intermediate for the reaction of CH x with CO 2 over Ni catalyst. Although different catalytic performances usually observed considering the Ni and noble metal catalysts (such as lower carbon deposition and hither activity), the Ni-based catalyst can be more active and resistant to coke accumulation when supported on appropriate catalyst support, which allows a more effective CO 2 activation. 5 Conclusions The catalyst support, MgAl 2 O 4 , plays an essential role in surface carbonaceous species with CO 2 , including assisting nickel to form highly and uniformly dispersed metallic nickel particles after reduction through the interaction between the active phase Ni and the support; allowing an effective way for CO 2 activation through formation of carbonate/bicarbonate type species, which contributes to the long-term stability and specific carbon elimination. The activation of methane through dehydrogenation progressively was confirmed by the observation of CH x species directly on Ni catalyst. The mechanistic aspect of surface active carbonaceous species with CO 2 over Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalysts was recommended according to these results. The surface carbonate species may migrate to the metal\u2013support interfacial region or may spill over onto the metal surface to react with CH x . This reaction provides a rationale for the stability of this catalyst.

BET and XRD results show that the pore size distributions of 15% TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O3 were mainly between micropores and meso-pores, and the CuO crystal diffraction peaks were detected, respectively. By using a hybrid system integrating plasma activation and a 12% CuO/TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst, the reactions of NO + CH4 + O2 were studied under different conditions including plasma only, catalyst only and plasma with catalyst. It is found that only plasma existed, the NO and CH4 conversion increased with a higher plasma power supply, and the addition of 2.5% O2 increased NO and CH4 conversion. Only when catalysts eristed, the NO and CH4 conversion both increased with the increase of temperature and reached 30% and 20%, respectively. And at the same time, the NO conversion was increased first with O2 content increasing and then decreased, and CH4 conversion was increased with O2 content increasing. When both plasma and catalyst coexisted, the conversion trend of the NO and CH4 with variation of O2 content was consistent with that when only catalyst existed. Besides, the NO conversion was in the range from 15% to 35% and the low temperature NO conversion was obviously increased. For the CH4 conversion, it was increased greatly to 90%.",

        "abstract": "In this research, Ni/SiO 2 catalyst was modified with different amount of Gd 2 O 3 and characterized with temperature-programmed desorption of CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) and NH 3 (NH 3 -TPD), temperature-programmed reduction with H 2 (H 2 -TPR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was found that Gd 2 O 3 -modified Ni/SiO 2 catalysts possessed higher CO 2 adsorption and activation ability due to the formation of surface carbonate species. H 2 -TPR and XRD characterizations found that the strong interaction among nickel, Gd 2 O 3 and SiO 2 took place, which improved the dispersion of Ni. Gd 2 O 3 -modified Ni/SiO 2 catalysts exhibited higher activity and stability for the combined oxy-CO 2 reforming of methane in fluidized-bed reactor. The H 2 /CO ratio in produced syngas could be controlled via controlling reaction temperature and CO 2 /O 2 ratio in feed.",

The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, H 2 -TPR and CO-TPD studies. The CuO CeO 2 catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity in CO oxidation, showing markedly enhanced catalytic activities due to the combined effect of copper oxide and cerium dioxide. The activity of the CuO CeO 2 (15%) catalyst prepared by impregnation is higher than that prepared by co-precipitation. CeO 2 promotes the hydrogen reduction activity of copper, so that CuO CeO 2 catalysts show a different behavior with respect to pure CuO. Two reducible copper species were observed in all CuO CeO 2 catalysts. CO-TPD experiments revealed that CuO CeO 2 catalysts can adsorb CO, while pure CuO and CeO 2 cannot. Combining the results of TPR, TPD study, and the catalytic activity measurements, it is proposed that the well dispersed CuO which can adsorb CO and which is reducible at low-temperature is responsible for low-temperature CO oxidation. The bulk CuO which cannot adsorb CO and which is reducible at high-temperature contributes little to the oxidation activity.",

The catalytic properties of CuO/Sn0.9Ti0.1O2 and CuO/Sn 0.7Ti0.3O2 were examined using a microreactor-gas chromatography (GC) NO+CO reaction system and the methods of BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller), TG-DTA (themogravimetric and differential thermal analysis), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The results showed that NO conversions of Sn 0.9Ti0.1O2 and Sn0.7Ti 0.3O2 were 47.2% and 43.6% respectively, which increased to 95.3% and 90.9% at 6 wt% CuO loading.

The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and pore-size distribution curve of Sn 0.9Ti0.1O2 and Sn0.7Ti 0.3O2 represented type IV of the BDDT (Brunauer, Deming, Deming and Teller) system and a typical mesoporous sample.

        "abstract": "Cu-Mn/zeolite-Y catalysts prepared using a coprecipitation impregnation procedure have been investigated to develop active Cu-based catalysts for the dimethyl ether synthesis from syngas. A great enhancement of CO conversion and DME selectivity is observed on Mn-containing catalysts compared to its Mn-free counterpart. However, an excess addition of manganese suppresses the syngas-dimethyl ether (STD) activity. Manganese has been found to be interacting with copper to form copper manganese mixed oxides phase (Cu1+x Mn2-xO4) upon calcinations, and the excess addition of copper or manganese will induce the segregation of copper or manganese as the isolated CuO or Mn2O3 phase, respectively. The segregates CuO phases enhanced the reducibility of the Cu1+x Mn2-xO4 phase and the Mn2O3 phase by reducing spill-over species. Harder reduction of the mixed oxides leads to the formation of much smaller metallic Cu particles, and MnO remaines closely associated with copper particles after reduction treatment, acting as a site for stability against CO2 oxidation of the surface copper. Furthermore, it is found that addition of Mn to Cu/zeolite-Y catalyst decreases the average crystalline size of copper to the same extent. Combining the TPR and XRD analysis, it suggests that catalysts with the excess CuO phases in conjunction with copper manganese mixed oxides are much more active than that with excess Mn2O3 phases together with copper manganese mixed oxides in the hydrogenation of CO to DME. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.",

Ni sintering was a major reason for the deactivation of pure Ni/SiO 2 catalysts, while Ni dispersed highly on a 10 wt % Sr promoted Ni/SrO\u2013SiO 2 catalyst. The enhanced interaction between Ni species and SrO-promoted support might be responsible for its high activity and good resistance to agglomeration of the nickel particles.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, studies of V-Cs-Cu and V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalysts used in the partial oxidation of p -tert butyl toluene to p -tert butyl benzaldehyde are reported. The two series of catalysts are prepared by an impregnation method. The effects of temperature, space velocity, concentration, ratio of O 2 / p -tert butyl toluene and the stability of catalysts are examined. The results indicate that both the catalysts show good catalytic activity in partial oxidation of p -tert butyl toluene to p -tert butyl benzaldehyde; but the series of V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalysts exhibit more excellent catalytic activity. Under the reaction conditions of space velocity at 10,000 h \u22121 and temperature at 440 \u00b0C, the conversion of p -tert butyl toluene can reach 12 mol% and the selectivity of p -tert butyl benzaldehyde is 85 mol%. In addition, the good stability in the series of V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalysts is another important character: the catalytic activity still remained significant after stability test for 365 h. Keywords Partial oxidation reaction p -Tert butyl benzaldehyde Catalyst 1 Introduction p -Tert butyl benzaldehyde is mainly used in foodstuff, and medicine and also enjoys wide demand in the chemical industry [1,2] . Few studies of the vapor phase partial oxidation of p -tert butyl toluene to produce p -tert butyl benzaldehyde have been reported, because it is quite difficult to get a good correspondence between the conversion and selectivity [3\u20136] . There are three reaction paths in the vapor phase partial oxidation of p -tert butyl toluene. They are (1) side chain oxidation, (2) oxidative couping reaction, (3) direct oxidation to CO 2 and H 2 O. However, it still has been an open question has remained as to how to find an excellent catalyst system and how to improve catalytic performance for the reaction. There are also many reports about the catalysts used in selective toluene oxidation, for example, the properties for oxidation of toluene to benzadehyde are improved by silver additions [7,8] and small addition of potassium to the V/Ti-oxide catalyst can increase the activity and selectivity [9] . Our aim is to identify a good catalyst for selective oxidation from p -tert butyl toluene to p -tert butyl benzaldehyde. Hence, the activities of V-Cs-Cu and V-Cs-Cu-Tl series of catalysts are assigned to the reaction. From our study, it is evident that these two system catalysts are optimal to the reaction. However, selective oxidation of p -tert butyl toluene is seldom reported. This is a novel catalyst system and an effective application in selective oxidation of p -tert butyl toluene. The main aim of our work is to find a new catalyst system that has good catalytic properties in both conversion and selectivity. In this paper, a new series of V-Cs-Cu-Tl/TiO 2 \u00b7SiC catalysts have been studied. V 2 O 5 is used as chief catalyst and the promoters Cs, Cu, Tl are used as active components. TiO 2 and silicon carbide (commercial) are used as the support. Our study has been to focus on using an active route for vapor phase catalytic oxidation method to produce p -tert butyl benzaldehyde, the obtained results are optimum values and have good advantages in both conversion and selectivity. The reaction mechanism for the formation of p -tert butyl benzaldehyde from p -tert butyl toluene is shown in Scheme 1 . 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the catalyst The catalysts are prepared by an impregnation method. In this study, cupric nitrate Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b73H 2 O, thallous nitrate (TlNO 3 ) and cesium nitrate (CsNO 3 ) are used for active compounds. Vanadylic citric acid solution is also added. The mixture was stirred enough, admixed with TiO 2 \u00b7SiC used as the supports, then dried by evaporation. After being dried at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h, the samples were calcined at 600 \u00b0C for 5 h and then pulverized into particles of 20\u201340 meshes. The composition of the catalysts in molar ratio is as follows: V/Cs is 0.2, V/Cu is 0.15 and V/Tl is n ( n =0.01\u20130.03). The catalysts are denoted as V-Cs-Cu and V-Cs-Cu-Tl. 2.2 Activity measurement The catalytic activity test for partial oxidation of p -tert butyl toluene to p -tert butyl benzaldehyde is performed in a flow reactor containing a fixed-bed of 3 ml of catalyst. The temperature is varied from room temperature to 500 \u00b0C. The total feed is 40 l/min (STP). The temperature is measured both before and after the catalyst bed. The flow of p -tert butyl toluene is fed using a mass flow controller. Liquid p -tert butyl toluene was pumped into heated evaporators through which the steam of air is passing before reaching the preheater. The analysis of the reactor effluent is performed with an on-line SP-2304 model vapor chromatograph with a FID. 2.3 Structure and surface characterization The active compounds\u2019 analysis of catalyst before and after reaction was performed on the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) instrument type PLASMA-SEEC, made in the US by Leeman Company. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns are collected on a Rigaku D/max-IIIB instrument using monochromatized Cu K\u03b1 radiation (40 kV and 30 mA). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is performed on a PHI-550 model ESCA/SAM spectrometer equipped with an Al anode ( h\u03bd =1486.6 eV). The binding energies are referenced to the binding energy level of O 1s at 531.8 eV. This value is an average of the O 1s binding energy determined by referring to the C 1s spectra (284.6). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of space velocity on catalyst activity The results of changes in the space velocity over V-Cs-Cu and V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . At the reaction temperature of 460 \u00b0C, it can be seen that the selectivity of p -tert butyl benzaldehyde increases with the increasing of space velocity from 5000 to 10,000 h \u22121 , but the conversion of p -tert butyl toluene varies oppositely. At space velocity of 10,000 h \u22121 , the conversion of p -tert butyl toluene and the selectivity of p -tert butyl benzaldehyde both increase to the maximum valves in these two catalysts. However, by comparison of V-Cs-Cu and V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst systems, the latter obtains better selectivity than the former at the condition of the space velocity at 10,000 \u22121 , but the selectivity decreases with the further increasing of space velocity. Such a result can be explained by the fact that reaction heat can be taken away more quickly from the catalyst surface with the increasing of space velocity and then the deep oxidation is prevented. 3.2 Effect of temperature on catalyst activity Here, we present the influence of temperature for the series of V-Cs-Cu and V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalysts. The results are given in Table 1 . At the conditions of space velocity at 10,000 h \u22121 and the p -tert butyl toluene concentration at 0.9\u20131.0 mol/m 3 , for V-Cs-Cu catalyst, the conversion of p -tert butyl toluene reaches 16.2 mol% and the selectivity of p -tert butyl benzaldehyde reaches 83.3 mol% at the temperature of 460 \u00b0C. And for V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst, the conversion of p -tert butyl toluene and the selectivity of p -tert butyl benzaldehyde reach >12.0 and 85.0 mol%, respectively, at the lower temperature of 440 \u00b0C. Both series of catalysts show good catalytic activities, but in comparison with the V-Cs-Cu catalyst, the V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst is more active. 3.3 Effect of p-tert butyl toluene concentration on catalyst activity The effect of p -tert butyl toluene concentration on the reaction properties was determined. At the conditions of reaction temperature at 460 \u00b0C and the velocity at 10,000 h \u22121 , the results are given in Fig. 2 . With the increasing of p -tert butyl toluene concentration, the conversion of p -tert butyl toluene increases in both catalysts, while the selectivity of p -tert butyl benzaldehyde of V-Cs-Cu catalyst attains a maximum at the concentration of 1.0 mol/m 3 . However, there is little change in the selectivity of p -tert butyl benzaldehyde of V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst: this indicates that V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst shows more applicability than V-Cs-Cu catalyst. In addition, if the p -tert butyl toluene concentration were quite high that would cause the excess dehydrogenation, which would result in a decreasing in selectivity. 3.4 Effect of O 2 / p -tert butyl toluene ratio on catalyst activity At the reaction condition of temperature at 460 \u00b0C and the space velocity at 10,000 h \u22121 , the effects of changing O 2 / p -tert butyl toluene ratio on V-Cs-Cu and V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . With the increasing of O 2 / p -tert butyl toluene ratio up to 5, there are apparently a maximum in conversion of p -tert butyl toluene and selectivity of p -tert butyl benzaldehyde. Here is the proper reaction: If there were 1.0 mol p -tert butyl toluene converted into corresponding p -tert butyl benzaldehyde, the O 2 / p -tert butyl toluene ratio should be to 1 theoretically. If the complete oxidation is as follows: The O 2 / p -tert butyl toluene ratio should rise to 15 theoretically. But in the vapor phase particle oxidation reaction, both mentioned reactions appear impossible. The aim of our study is to obtain the good results both in the suitable conversion and the highest selectivity. So the ratio of O 2 / p -tert butyl toluene should be adjusted to a ratio between 1 and 15. From the results indicated in Fig. 3 , on can conclude that an O 2 / p -tert butyl toluene ratio of about 5 is appropriate for the purpose of obtaining good catalytic activity in both conversion and selectivity. 3.5 Test of catalyst stability When one studies the influence of space velocity, temperature, p -tert butyl toluene concentration and O 2 / p -tert butyl toluene on the reaction properties of catalyst, it is worthwhile to test its stability. From Fig. 4 , it can be seen clearly that, after 365 h reaction, the catalytic activity of V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst is stable. No significant changes in either the conversion or the selectivity could be observed during the stability experiment. 3.6 Catalytic activity of toluene In order to investigate these two series of catalysts in other substances, the catalytic activity for toluene was also tested; the result is listed in Table 2 . At the condition of velocity at 10,000 h \u22121 , reaction temperature at 460 \u00b0C and toluene concentration at 1.2 mol/m 3 , the result of 40.7% selectivity of benzaldehyde is obtained, but the conversion is very poor: 2.2 mol% in V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst. But in V-Cs-Cu catalyst, the catalyst has hardly any effect on the catalytic activity from toluene to benzaldehyde. However, the result indicates that these two series of catalysts show relatively lower activity and selectivity in the vapor phase oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. Associated with the novel results of these two series catalysts obtained in the selective oxidation of p -tert butyl toluene to p -tert butyl benzaldehyde, the above result can be explained by the different reaction mechanisms in different reaction substances such as p -tert butyl toluene and toluene on V-Cs-Cu and V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst. 3.7 Structure and surface characterization of catalyst Table 3 shows the results for the content of active compounds of V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst before and used after 365 h reaction. From Table 3 , it can be seen that there is little difference in the content of the catalyst active compounds. Combined with stability testing results, these results show clearly that a catalyst of high stability is related with the fact that the contents of the catalyst active compounds remain almost unchanged after reaction. The surface oxygen species of the catalysts is another important factor. Fig. 5 shows the XPS of O 1s analysis of the samples before and after 365 h reaction. A survey of XPS spectra indicates the presence of O 1s with two peaks in sample (a) and (b). One O 1s peak is near 532.00 eV and the other is near 529.00 eV. The \u03b1 peak is represented by sorption oxygen, while the \u03b2 peak is represented by lattice oxygen [10] . They play different roles in the catalytic reaction. Obviously, the intensity of \u03b2 peak decreases appreciably in sample (b) after 365 h reaction, while the \u03b1 peak is almost unchanged. Meanwhile, it can be seen that the binding energies of both the \u03b1 peak and the \u03b2 peak decrease. This can be explained by assuming that the V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst has the ability to transform any adsorbed oxygen species rapidly into lattice oxygen, which is required for selective oxidation. Therefore, we propose that the lowering of the peak area of \u03b2 peak should be attributed to the lattice oxygen. Fig. 5 indicates that the lattice oxygen has participated in this selective oxidation reaction. The result that the active oxygen numbers decrease also shows a good correlation with the high selectivity on V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst. On the basis of the XPS results, it can be concluded that the lattice oxygen is the main contributor in particle oxidation from p -tert butyl toluene to p -tert butyl benzaldehyde. However, the V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst which has been used at 440 \u00b0C for 365 h is examined by X-ray diffraction analysis. No new phases are created in the catalyst. Thus, it is in accordance with the results of the content of active compounds test. 4 Conclusion From the results mentioned above, one can see that the V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst system has a significant effect on the reaction of partial oxidation of p -tert butyl toluene to p -tert butyl benzaldehyde. After 365 h reaction, the series of catalysts still keep the high catalytic activity. On the basis of ICP and XPS results, we conclude that the high catalytic activity of V-Cs-Cu-Tl catalyst is related to the content of the catalyst active compounds remaining unchanged after a long reaction and to the function of the lattice oxygen.

        "abstract": "Pt/CoAl2O4/Al2O3, Pt/CoOxAl2O3, CoAl2O4/Al2O3 and CoOx/Al2O3 catalysts were studied for combination CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of CH4. The results indicate that Pt/CoAl2O4/Al2O3 is the most effective, and XRD results indicate that Pt species are well dispersed over the Pt/CoAl2O4/Al2O3. High dispersion is related to the presence of CoAl2O4, formed during calcining at high temperature before Pt addition. In the presence of Pt, CoAl2O4 in the catalyst could be reduced partially at 973 K. Based on these results, it appears that zerovalent platinum with high dispersion and zerovalent cobalt resulting from CoAl2O4 reduction are responsible for high activity in the Pt/CoAl2O4/Al2O3 catalyst.",

        "abstract": "Six new type binuclear platinum(II) complexes (a-f) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, conductivity, thermal analysis, IR, UV, (1)H NMR and mass spectra techniques. The cytotoxicity of the complexes was tested by MTT and SRB assays. The cell cycle analysis and the levels of total platinum bound to DNA were measured by flow cytometry and ICP-MS, respectively. The results indicate that the complex (a) has no cytotoxicity against HL-60, BGC-823, Bel-7402, KB and Hela, the complexes (b, c, e and f) have weaker cytotoxicity against some tested carcinoma cell lines, the complex (d) has better cytotoxicity against HL-60, BGC-823, Bel-7402, KB, MCF-7, HCT-8 and Hela with respect to the IC(50) values obtained. The cytotoxicity of the complex (d) is equal to that of cisplatin against HL-60 and Bel-7402 (P>0.05), but it has better cytotoxicity than that of cisplatin against BGC-823 and MCF-7 (P<0.05). The complex (d) causes significant G(2)/M arrest and a concomitant decrease of cell population in G(1) and S phases, and the total DNA platination levels of the complex (d) are higher than those of cisplatin under the same experimental conditions. It suggests that the bridging linker has important effect on their cytotoxicity. Indeed, when the bridging linker is dicarboxylic acid, their cytotoxicity is better than that of platinum complexes with an amino acid as bridging linker. The new type binuclear platinum(II) complexes represent a novel class of anticancer agents, which deserves further attention in search of anticancer lead compounds.",

Pd/CeO2 exhibits high catalytic activity for the oxidation of CO, showing markedly enhanced catalytic activities due to the combined effect of palladium and cerium dioxide. The Pd/CeO2 catalyst is superior to Pd/ZrO2, Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2, Pd/ZSM-5 and Pd/SiO2 catalysts with regard to the activity under the conditions examined. The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD and TPR. The position of the H2-TPR peak shifts to lower temperature with increasing Pd loading from 0.25 to 2.0%. CeO2 inhibits the hydrogen reduction of PdO. CO-TPR measurements have shown the existence of three peaks. The low-temperature peak (\u03b1) is due to the Pd hydroxide species. The \u03b2 peak has been attributed to finely dispersed PdO. The high-temperature peak (\u03b3) has been attributed to crystal phase PdO. Crystal phase PdO is more difficult to reduce by CO than finely dispersed PdO. On the basis of the catalytic activity and CO-TPR results, we conclude \u03b1 species (Pd hydroxide) mainly contribute to the catalytic activity for low-temperature CO oxidation.",

Combining the characterization results with the performance tests, the activity of catalyst greatly depended on Ni particles size, and the stability was affected by the coke composition. Both of them (Ni particle size and coke composition) were closely related to the interaction between nickel and support which would determine the chemical environment where Ni inhabited. The best catalytic performance was observed on Ni/MgO due to the strong interaction between NiO and MgO via the formation of Ni-Mg-O solid solution, and the highest dispersion of Ni particle in the basic environment.",

CuO/Sn0.8Ti0.2O2 had high activity in NO+CO reaction, showing 93% NO conversion at 300 \u00b0C in air, and 100% NO conversion at 225 \u00b0C after H2 pretreatment. The pore size distribution of Sn0.8Ti0.2O2 was mainly as micro-pores and meso-pores (1-5 nm), and the specific surface area and total pore volume of Sn0.8Ti0.2O2 were 69 m2\u00b7 g-1 and 0.15 cm3\u00b7g-1, respectively. As shown by XRD analysis, there was no CuO crystal diffraction peak at 9% CuO loading, but two CuO crystal diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 35.5\u00b0 and 38.7\u00b0 were present at 12% CuO loading. FTIR detected the adsorption of NO and CO on the surface of reduced 12%CuO/Sn0.8Ti0.2O 2. The Cu2+ sites and support surface adsorbed NO, and the process of NO adsorption led to the formation of N2O and NO 3 -. In contrast, the Cu+,Cu\u00b0 sites and support surface adsorbed CO, and when the mixed gases of NO and CO were adsorbed by support surface, no NO3 - was formed. H2-TPR showed four reduction peaks (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4). The \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 peaks were the reductions of CuO species, and the \u03b4 peak was the reduction of Sn0.8Ti0.2O2.",

The results indicate that Pt/CoAl 2 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 is more effective, and XRD results indicate that Pt species are well dispersed over the Pt/CoAl 2 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 . High dispersion is related to the presence of CoAl 2 O 4 , formed during calcining at high temperature before Pt addition. In the presence of Pt, CoAl 2 O 4 in the catalyst could be reduced partially at 973 K. Based on these results, it appears that zerovalent platinum with high dispersion and zerovalent cobalt resulting from CoAl 2 O 4 reduction are responsible for high activity in the Pt/CoAl 2 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst.",

It is shown that adding a certain quantity of Ni is beneficial to methane conversion. When Ni/Mo molar ratio is 0.05, the methane conversion and aromatic selectivity reach 11.3% and 97.1% respectively at 973 K reaction temperature. Increase in temperature improves the catalytic behavior of Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst and 15.7% of the methane conversion is obtained at 1023 K. The reaction with pretreatment by N2 is better than those pretreated with H2, CH4 or air. The results of isopropanol decomposition show that the surface acidity on Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 is increased at high temperature. The NH3-TPD findings suggest that the Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst has much stronger acidity and more amount of acid sites than Mo/HZSM-5. This might be one of the reasons for the enhancement in the activity for methane aromatization over Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst.",

The results obtained show that there is a great difference between CeO2 support and other kinds of supports in the crystal phase structure and particle size, which are responsible for CO and CH4 oxidation. The order of catalytic activity for the CH4 oxidation is: PdO/CeO2 > PdO/TiO2 > PdO/\u03b3-Al2O3 and that for CO oxidation is: PdO/CeO2 > PdO\u03b3-Al2O3 > PdO/TiO2. It is interesting to find that the PdO/CeO2 catalyst exhibits high catalytic activity for CO oxidation even at a low temperature of 50\u00b0C. Due to strong interaction between ceria and palladium, excellent results are obtained in the oxidation reaction of CO or CH4. The high dispersion of PdO is found to be the main factor for the high catalytic oxidation activity observed.",

        "abstract": "The effects of ceria and zirconium additions to alumina-supported palladium catalysts on methane combustion behavior have been investigated. A series of Ce-Zr-modified Al2O3 supports and their supported Pd catalysts are prepared using impregnation method and then characterized by BET, XRD, LR, TEM, XPS techniques. The results show that the addition of Ce-Zr improves the thermal stability of alumina. The thermal stability of alumina increases with increasing the loading of Zr. The methane oxidation activity and thermal stability is found to be dependent on the Ce:Zr ratio over the Pd/CexZr1-x/Al2O3 catalysts. The Pd/Ce0.2Zr0.8/Al2O3 exhibits the highest activity and thermal stability for methane oxidation. The temperatures for the 90% methane conversion are 448 and 455 \u00b0C for the Pd/Ce0.2Zr0.8/Al2O3 catalysts calcined at 500 and 1100 \u00b0C, respectively. TEM results show that the particle size of Pd is not the key factor influencing the activity of Pd/Ce 0.2Zr0.8/Al2O3 catalyst. An induction period is present during methane combustion reaction for the Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/CexZr1-x/Al 2O3 catalysts (calcined at 1100 \u00b0C), but the lengths of induction period are obviously different and the Pd/Ce0.2Zr 0.8/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the shortest induction period. XPS results show that comparing to Pd/Al2O 3 catalyst the addition of Ce-Zr stabilizes Pd in a high oxidation state and enhances the reoxidation of metallic Pd to the active PdO under reaction conditions. Therefore the Pd/CexZr1-x/Al 2O3 catalysts compared to Pd/Al2O3 catalysts have higher thermal stability and shorter induction period. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

After reduction, the activity of the catalysts in the CO2 reforming of CH4 was studied. Pre-reduced La2NiO4 catalyst obtained by the PC method displayed a rather high activity and the highest stability. The well-defined La2NiO4 precursor structure and the K2NiF4-type perovskite played an important role in the CO2 reforming of CH4 performance.",

The results showed that carbon monooxide was not the product over those catalysts whether CeO2 was added or not, but the yield of methane was increased with CeO2 addition. At 300\u00b0C, the yield of methane over Ni-CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts was two times higher than that over Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. The DRFTIR results showed that methane came from two processes, which were hydrogenation of CO- 2 species and formate species over the catalysts. The more effective species was formate on the surface of catalyst. The reason why the activity of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was promoted by addition CeO2 was that a large amount of formate forms over Ni-CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst.",

The photocatalysts were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrum and UV-Vis (Ultraviolet-Visible) spectrometry techniques, and the photocatalytic activity in phenol-contaminated water was investigated. The results showed that photocatalysts calcined at 400 \u00b0C had a specific surface area of 138.2 m2/g and an average particle size of 9 nm, and a significant increase in thermal stability of anatase phase. At the calcination temperature of 700 \u00b0C, the crystal form of TiO2 started to change into rutile (anatase: 97%, rutile: 3%). The activity of TiO2 photocatalysts prepared with (NH4)2SO4-modified TiCl4 solution was markedly stronger than that without (NH 4)2SO4-modified TiCl4 solution.

Methods of Brunauer - Emmett - Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2 - temperature-programmed reduction (H2 - TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to investigate the catalyst characteristics before and after the reactions. The results showed that plasma discharge improved low-temperature reaction activity and addition of O2 increased NO and CH4 conversion. Pore size distribution of 15% TiO 2/\u03b3-Al2O3 was a typical texture of the alumina support. The specific surface area of 12% CuO/15% TiO 2/\u03b3-Al2O3 changed little before and after the NO + CH4 reaction, but its surface crystalline CuO reduced to Cu 2O and Cu, which was found by XPS analysis. After the reaction, highly dispersed CuO and bulk CuO reduction peak of the catalyst vanished after the NO + CH4 reaction.

        "abstract": "An experimental study of Ni/MgO solid solution catalyst in CO2 reforming of toluene was conducted in this paper. Experimental parameters were reduction temperature, reaction temperature, CO2/toluene mole ratio, and toluene feed rate. An optimized reduction temperature was 700 \u00b0C to obtain the sufficient surface Ni as well as avoid the severe sintering of Ni particles. Either higher reaction temperatures or higher CO2/toluene mole ratios made Ni/MgO more stable and efficient. Ni/MgO at 550 \u00b0C and a high CO2/toluene mole ratio of 28 had a better activity with less coke than that at 570 \u00b0C but low CO2/toluene mole ratios (\u226414), which suggested the activation of carbon intermediates from the dissociation of toluene by abundant oxidizing CO2 species played a crucial role in having a better catalytic performance. At a high toluene feed rate (0.48 ml/h), Ni/MgO had an inferior activity due to the comparatively insufficient active Ni; moreover, it had a worse stability because of a large amount of coke. Graphical abstract: Experimental study for toluene reforming with CO2 on Ni/MgO catalyst. Highlights: Tar reforming with CO 2 was used to minimize CO2 release from gasification. Experimental study of Ni/MgO catalyst was studied for a possible application. The sufficient surface Ni amount was fundamental to have a high activity. The quick oxidation of surface carbon by CO2 was crucial for catalytic stability. Two types of coke under high toluene feed rate were detected by CO2-TPO test. \u00a9 2012 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Pt/CoAl2O4/Al2O3, Pt/CoOx/Al2O3, CoAl2O4/Al2O3 and CoOx/Al2O3 catalysts were studied for combination CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of CH4. The results indicate that Pt/CoAl2O4/Al2O3 is the most effective, and XRD results indicate that Pt species are well dispersed over the Pt/CoAl2O4/Al2O3. High dispersion is related to the presence of CoAl2O4, formed during calcining at high temperature before Pt addition. In the presence of Pt, CoAl2O4 in the catalyst could be reduced partially at 973 K. Based on these results, it appears that zerovalent platinum with high dispersion and zerovalent cobalt resulting from CoAl2O4 reduction are responsible for high activity in the Pt/CoAl2O4/Al2O3 catalyst.",

The results show that the hydrogenation of CNB can be carried out over Pt/ZrO2 catalyst. The order of the hydrogenation rates of CNB is p>m>o, and the yield of chloroaniline (CAN) is p>o>m. The specific rate constant turnover frequency (TOF) expressed per surface Pt atom increases when the platinum catalyst is modified by rare earth.

In this work, glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO was performed over CuO/MgO catalysts prepared by impregnation and coprecipitation at 180 degrees C and 3.0 MPa H(2). It was found that the Cu(15)/MgO catalyst prepared by coprecipitation had the best activity. The conversion of glycerol and the selectivity of 1,2-PDO over Cu(15)/MgO reached 72.0% and 97.6%, respectively. And the conversion of glycerol was further increased to 82.0% when small amount of NaOH was added in the reaction mixture. Those highly active catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N(2)-adsorption and temperature-programmed reduction with H(2). Characterization results revealed that the activity of the prepared catalysts depended strongly on the particle sizes of both Cu and MgO. Catalysts that have smaller sized Cu and MgO particles are more active for glycerol hydrogenolysis.",

The structural and reductive properties of the CexTi1-xO2 were affected by calcination temperature. At x = 0.1-0.3, CeTi2O6 phase was formed and mainly as amorphous after calcination at 650\u00b0C. At x = 0.3, only CeTi 2O6 was formed after calcination at 750\u00b0C and CeTi2O6 crystallized completely after calcination at 800\u00b0C. TPR analyses showed that the amount of H2 consumption by CexTi1-xO2 (650\u00b0C) (except x = 0.1) was greater than that by single CeO2, and the valence of CeO2 was the lowest (+ 3.18) at x = 0.3. CuO/Ce0.3Ti0.7O 2 was prepared by the impregnation method and catalytic properties were examined by means of a GC micro-reactor NO + CO reaction system, BET, TPR, XRD, XPS and NO-TPD.

The catalytic activities were largely affected by the pre-treatment conditions. At low reduction temperature (100\u00b0C), CuO species was difficult to reduce. When high degree of reductions took place, both CuO species and Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 reduced and thus a part of CuO species on the support surface would be covered. The XPS and NO-TPD analyses showed that CuO/Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 had four NO absorption centers (Cu+, Cu2+ (I), Cu2+ (II) and Ce3+). The CuO species involving in NO + CO reaction included Cu2+ (I) and Cu+, and CeO2 species (Ce 3+ and Ce4+).",

Keywords CuO-CeO 2 Preferential oxidation CO Fuel cell Preparation method 1 Introduction Recently, the CuO-CeO 2 catalyst has been attracting attentions because of its activity higher than that of conventional copper-based catalysts and comparable or superior to that of platinum catalysts for the preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen [1\u20135] , which has been used for PEM fuel cells (PEMFCS). It is believed that the reaction is catalyzed by the interfacial copper oxide-ceria centers in which ceria presents a high number of oxygen vacancies that permits a high mobility of lattice oxygen [6,7] . For CuO-CeO 2 catalysts, preparation methods have a critical influence on preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen. Preparation methods reported are co-precipitation [8\u201310] , urea-nitrate combustion method [11,12] , sol\u2013gel peroxo route [13,14] , etc. Avgouropoulos et al. [15] investigated the difference among four CuO-CeO 2 catalysts prepared by using the co-precipitation, the citrate-hydrothermal, the urea-nitrates combustion and the impregnation methods. They found that the combustion-prepared sample exhibited the best catalytic performance, followed by the citrate-hydrothermally-prepared sample. The impregnated one was least active. However, CuO-CeO 2 catalysts synthesized by Kim and Cha [3] using co-precipitation methods, with a BET specific surface area of 91 m 2 /g, showed superior performance in the preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen; i.e., these catalysts reduced the CO content to less than 100 ppm at the temperature below 170 \u00b0C for a feed of 1% CO, 1% or 1.25% O 2 , 50% H 2 in the presence of H 2 O and CO 2 . Obviously, the preparation methods had a marked effect on the performance of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts in the preferential oxidation of CO. In this work, influence of the preparation methods (i.e. co-precipitation, chelating, citric acid and critical phase) on the preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen over CuO-CeO 2 catalysts has been investigated, and the catalysts have been characterized by BET, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV Raman and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) techniques. The catalyst prepared by chelating gave a catalytic performance in the preferential oxidation of CO superior to the catalysts prepared by the other preparation methods. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Sample 1 (designated as 5CuC-CP) was synthesized by co-precipitation from the mixture (250 ml) of 0.055 mol/l Ce(NO 3 ) 2 and 0.008 mol/l Cu(NO 3 ) 2 . 0.362 mol/l KOH was added dropwise with vigorous stirring, and then the mixture was aged for about 20 min. The pH value of the mixture was 12.5 and the obtained precipitate was washed with distilled water until pH was decreased to 7.0, followed by washing with 200 ml ethanol before being dried at 105 \u00b0C for about 3 h. The dried sample was thermally treated at 500 \u00b0C for about 2 h. Sample 2 (designated as 5CuC-CE) was synthesized by drying under a critical phase of ethanol. The other steps were similar to those for the co-precipitation-prepared sample. Sample 3 (designated as 5CuC-CH) was synthesized by the chelating method. The solution of cetytrimethyammonium bromide (C 19 H 42 BrN) was added dropwise into the mixture of 0.055 mol/l Ce(NO 3 ) 2 and 0.008 mol/l Cu(NO 3 ) 2 solutions with vigorous stirring, and the obtained sol\u2013gel was aged for 30 min at ambient temperatures. It should be noted that all the solvent in the experiment is not water but ethanol. Then, the sol\u2013gel was dried at 100 \u00b0C for about 5 h and then thermally treated at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h. Sample 4 (designated as 5CuC-CA) was prepared by the citric acid method. Aqueous solution of 0.060 mol/l citric acid was added dropwise into the mixture of equal amount of 0.055 mol/l Ce(NO 3 ) 2 and 0.008 mol/l Cu(NO 3 ) 2 under continuous stirring and then the mixture was kept stirring for 6 h. The mixed solution was dried at 120 \u00b0C for a few hours to obtain the powder, followed by thermal treatment at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h. All treated catalysts were crushed and sieved to 60\u201380 meshes. The Cu content over all the catalysts was expressed as the Cu/(Cu + CeO 2 ) wt% ratio and all data below were obtained with 5.0 wt% Cu catalysts. 2.2 Measurement of catalytic performance The activity measurement was carried out in a fixed-bed micro-reactor (quartz glass, i.d. 4 mm, o.d. 6 mm, length 250 mm) at atmospheric pressure. The reactor temperature was measured with a K-type thermocouple located at the top of the packed catalyst bed and controlled by a temperature controller. The mass of catalyst used in the experiments was 50 mg, and the catalyst was diluted with inert alumina particles (60\u201380 meshes) with a mass ratio of 1:1. A desired mixture of gases (i.e. 50% H 2 , 1.0% O 2 , 1.0% CO and Ar in balance) was prepared by adjusting the ratio of flows with the mass flow controllers (Scientific Alicat). The steam was introduced with reacting gases bubbling through a thermostat water bath. The reactor inlet and outlet streams were measured using an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). H 2 and O 2 were separated by a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column and detected with TCD. CO and CO 2 were separated by a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) column, then converted to methane by a methanation reactor and analyzed by FID. The detection limit of FID for CO is less than 3 ppm. Taking into consideration of the existence of CO 2 in the feedstock, the CO conversion was calculated based on the CO decrease as follows: % \u2009 of \u2009 conversion \u2009 of \u2009 CO = [ CO ] in \u2212 [ CO ] out [ CO ] in \u00d7 100 The selectivity was defined as the oxygen consumed by CO oxidation, namely: % \u2009 of \u2009 selectivity = 0.5 ( [ CO ] in \u2212 [ CO ] out ) [ O 2 ] in \u2212 [ O 2 ] out \u00d7 100 2.3 Characterization of catalysts The specific area of the sample was obtained at \u2212196 \u00b0C using a Coulter Omnisorp 100CX. Prior to the measurement, the sample was pretreated at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max 2550PC powder diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation. UV Raman spectra were recorded on a UV-HR Raman spectrograph. The laser power measured at the samples was below 4.0 mW for 325 nm radiation. H 2 temperature-programmed reduction was carried out using a conventional reactor equipped with TCD. Fifty milligrams catalyst and 40 ml/min flowing velocity of 5% H 2 /Ar were applied in this work. The temperature rate was 10 \u00b0C/min from 30 \u00b0C to 570 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The catalytic performance of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts The preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen over the CuO-CeO 2 catalysts prepared by different methods is illustrated in Fig. 1 . From Fig. 1 , it can be seen that the preparation methods have a significant influence on the catalytic performance of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts. 5CuC-CH exhibits the highest catalytic activity in the preferential oxidation of CO and 5CuC-CA shows the lowest catalytic activity. T 60 (i.e. the temperature required for 60% conversion of CO) for 5CuC-CP, 5CuC-CH, 5CuC-CA and 5CuC-CE are 106 \u00b0C, 81 \u00b0C, 109 \u00b0C and 95 \u00b0C, respectively. However, in the temperature range from 60 \u00b0C to 160 \u00b0C, the highest conversions of CO appear in the light-off curves of the catalysts, and the corresponding temperatures for 5CuC-CP, 5CuC-CH, 5CuC-CA and 5CuC-CE are 160 \u00b0C (98.0% of CO conversion), 120 \u00b0C (99.6% of CO conversion), 160 \u00b0C (99.2% of CO conversion) and 145 \u00b0C (97.3% of CO conversion), respectively. In addition, at a space velocity of 120,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 , 5CuC-CP and 5CuC-CE cannot reach CO conversion higher than 99.0% (namely the CO concentration less than 100 ppm) in contrast with 5CuC-CH and 5CuC-CA attaining CO conversion higher than 99.0%. It is evident that 5CuC-CH shows outstanding catalytic activity in the preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen compared with 5CuC-CP, 5CuC-CA and 5CuC-CE. The selectivity of O 2 shows a contrary trend with the increase in reaction temperatures, due to the fact that displacement of adsorbed hydrogen by carbon monoxide and blocking of hydrogen adsorption by preadsorbed carbon monoxide occur during the competing adsorption of hydrogen and carbon monoxide [16] . For example, in case of 5CuC-CH, the selectivity declines from 100.0% at 100 \u00b0C to about 48.0% at 145 \u00b0C. In addition, for 5CuC-CA and 5CuC-CE, 100% selectivity of O 2 is still observed at 110 \u00b0C. Consequently, 5CuC-CH has a lower selectivity of O 2 than 5CuC-CA and 5CuC-CE. Fig. 2 illustrates the influence of the space velocity. As seen from Fig. 2 , increase in the space velocity has a negative effect on the performance of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts prepared with the chelating method. At the space velocity of 120,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 , the CO conversion and selectivity of O 2 over CuO-CeO 2 catalyst are slightly lower than at 30,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 . In order to investigate the stability of 5CuC-CH and eliminate the influence of initial activity of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts on the measurement of activity, the duration test is run for 12 h at 120 \u00b0C and 120,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 of GHSV in a feed of 1% CO, 1% O 2 , 50% H 2 and Ar in balance. As shown in Fig. 3 , the CO conversions is kept at the values higher than 99% during the run. Selectivity of O 2 exhibits a slight increase, about 1% in the end of the test. It is evident that 5CuC-CH possesses a desirable stability, which is consistent with some literature [2,3] . Thus, the influence of initial activity of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts on the measurement of activity is eliminated. 3.2 The structural studies of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts Table 1 lists the pore volume, average pore diameter and surface areas and catalytic activity of the CuO-CeO 2 catalysts prepared by different methods. From Table 1 , it can be seen that 5CuC-CP has the largest BET area (111 m 2 g \u22121 ) and the lowest TOF (0.047 \u03bcmol CO (s m 2 ) \u22121 ), while 5CuC-CA has a BET area of only about one third of that of 5CuC-CP and the highest TOF (1.419 \u03bcmol CO (s m 2 ) \u22121 ). 5CuC-CH with a surface area of 99 m 2 g \u22121 achieves the highest activity in preferential oxidation of CO. Namely T 60 of 5CuC-CH is as low as 81 \u00b0C, compared with 109 \u00b0C over 5CuC-CA and 106 \u00b0C over 5CuC-CP. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts prepared by different preparation methods. It can be seen that the distinct fluorite-type oxide structure of CeO 2 is observed in all samples [17] , and that the peaks of 5CuC-CH are broader than those of other catalysts, which indicates that 5CuC-CH has a smaller particle size than the other catalysts. In addition, four peaks can be found at 36\u00b0, 38.6\u00b0, 42\u00b0 and 43\u00b0. Peaks at 36\u00b0 and 38.6\u00b0 are assigned to the peak of crystal CuO. The peaks of CuO appear in the XRD patterns of 5CuC-CP, 5CuC-CA and 5CuC-CE. However, no peaks of CuO can be seen in that of 5CuC-CH, which means that CuO is well dispersed in 5CuC-CH. Two peaks at 42\u00b0 and 43\u00b0 are assigned to the formation of cerium and copper solid solution. The peaks of cerium and copper solid solution appear in the XRD patterns of 5CuC-CP, 5CuC-CA and 5CuC-CE. No peaks of cerium and copper solid solution can be seen in that of 5CuC-CH. However, it should also be noted that the XRD peaks of CeO 2 are rather broad and shifts of small magnitude cannot be detectable. Therefore, the possibility of existence of trace copper and cerium solid solution cannot be excluded. Fig. 5 shows the UV Raman spectra recorded by using a laser at 325 nm as the excitation source. A broad band with relatively high intensity at 462 cm \u22121 is assigned to cubic CeO 2 in CuO-CeO 2 catalysts together with two bands at 584 cm \u22121 and 1176 cm \u22121 [12] . The bands at about 584 cm \u22121 and 1176 cm \u22121 can be linked to oxygen vacancies in the CeO 2 lattice and attributed to the CeO 2 defects [18,19] . It can also be seen that the intensity of 584 cm \u22121 and 1176 cm \u22121 bands of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts builds up with the increase in the turn of 5CuC-CP, 5CuC-CE, 5CuC-CA and 5CuC-CH, which indicates that the amount of defects in CuO-CeO 2 catalysts is increased. Defects have a beneficial influence on the catalytic performance of CuO-based catalysts in preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen [20] . Consequently, the amount of defects correlates well with the activity of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts. The H 2 -TPR profiles of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts prepared by different methods are illustrated in Fig. 6 . From Fig. 6 , it can be seen that the overlapping reduction peaks of CuO x species, for 5CuC-CP, 5CuC-CE and 5CuC-CA, consist of a low-intensity, low-temperature peak at about 161 \u00b0C ( \u03b1 peak) and a higher-intensity peak at about 180 \u00b0C ( \u03b2 peak). In addition, a shoulder peak is found at 203.7 \u00b0C in the case of 5CuC-CA, and assigned to \u03b2 \u2032 peak. Generally, there are several types of copper-oxygen entities [20,21] : (a) isolated Cu 2+ ions can strongly interact with the support; (b) weak magnetic associates consist of several Cu 2+ ions and these Cu 2+ ions have close contact with each other; (c) small two- and three-dimensional clusters have so loose structures that they have no specific and regular lattice arrangement; (d) large three-dimensional clusters and bulk CuO phase have characters and properties identical to those of pure CuO powder. Therefore, in this work, \u03b1 peak may be attributed to a type or b type, \u03b2 peak may be assigned to c type and \u03b3 or \u03b2 \u2032 peak may be assigned to d type. However, for 5CuC-CH, not only \u03b1 peak at 161.7 \u00b0C but also \u03b3 peak at 274.6 \u00b0C is found. There is an overlapping reduction peak between \u03b1 peak and \u03b3 peak. H 2 consumptions of \u03b1 , \u03b2 and \u03b3 peaks are (multi-peaks fitted according to the Lorentz method and shown in Table 2 ) 295 \u03bcmol/g cat , 568 \u03bcmol/g cat and 256 \u03bcmol/g cat , respectively. The amount of H 2 consumption for \u03b1 , \u03b2 and \u03b3 peaks are 1119 \u03bcmol/g cat and larger than the theoretical amount of H 2 consumption in 5CuC-CH (i.e. 787 \u03bcmol/g cat ). Furthermore, in Fig. 7 , CeO 2 -CH (prepared by the chelating method) has two peaks in the TPR profile, one at 414 \u00b0C and the other at 513 \u00b0C. When copper oxide and cerium oxide is prepared by the chelating method, 5CuC-CH exhibits H 2 reduction peaks well below 450 \u00b0C. Obviously, the reduction of surface or bulk oxygen species of ceria is involved, which indicates that ceria has an amount of copper oxide dissolved in it. The amount of copper oxide, even though perhaps small, is large enough to change its oxide ion transport properties and enable bulk reduction at 400 \u00b0C [9] . In addition, \u03b3 peaks in TPR patterns of 5CuC-CH cannot be assigned to the reduction of bulk CuO. If \u03b3 peak were assigned to the reduction of bulk CuO, signal of bulk CuO should have been strong enough to be seen in the XRD pattern, due to the existence of large amount of bulk CuO. However, in the case of 5CuC-CH, bulk CuO or solid solution of copper and cerium cannot be found in the XRD patterns, which indicates that some other species are reduced at the position of \u03b3 peak. In general, pure CuO and Cu 2 O catalysts exhibit H 2 reduction peaks at approximately 180 \u00b0C and 300 \u00b0C [22] . Therefore, \u03b1 and \u03b3 peaks may be assigned to the reduction of CuO and Cu 2 O, respectively. Moreover, Fig. 8 indicates the influence of redox cycles on reducibility of 5CuC-CH. With the increase in redox cycles, \u03b1 peak shifts to higher temperature and \u03b2 peaks appear between \u03b1 and \u03b3 peaks, while the position of \u03b3 peaks slightly changes. Thus, \u03b2 peak is assigned to the reduction of CuO with larger particle sizes. According to above discussion, the reduction of 5CuC-CH includes several types: (a) reduction of CuO with small particle sizes; (b) reduction of CuO with large particle sizes; (c) reduction of Cu 2 O; (d) reduction of surface or bulk oxygen species of ceria.During the reduction of 5CuC-CH the equilibrium of the above reduction types can be expressed as follow [23,24] : Ce 4+ + Cu 1+ \u2194 Ce 3+ + Cu 2+ This equilibrium can stabilize the cationic copper species in the structure even in highly reductive atmosphere [9] . If so, the high activity of CO oxidation in excess hydrogen over 5CuC-CH can evolve as a synergic effect between the cycle of Cu 1+ /Cu 2+ and that of Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ . 4 Conclusions In this work, the influence of preparation methods (i.e. co-precipitation, chelating, citric acid and critical phase) on the preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen over CuO-CeO 2 catalysts has been investigated and CuO-CeO 2 catalysts are characterized by using BET, XRD, UV Raman and TPR techniques. The catalyst prepared by chelating is most active in preferential oxidation of CO. CO conversion over 5CuC-CH is 99.6% at the temperature of 120 \u00b0C, while CO conversions over 5CuC-CE and 5CuC-CP cannot reach 99% in all reaction temperature range and that over 5CuC-CA is 99.2% at the temperature of 160 \u00b0C. In addition, the chelating method enhances the formation of defects of ceria and produces a synergic effect between the cycle of Cu 1+ /Cu 2+ and that of Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ , which are beneficial to the improvement of the performance of CuO-CeO 2 catalysts.

        "abstract": "Partial oxidation of methane and reforming of CO2 were investigated in a fluidized bed reactor over Ni/SiO2 catalyst modified by adding CeO2 in SiO2 support. The Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst were characterized by means of XRD, H2-TPR and CH4/CO2-temperature programmed surface reaction(TPSR)-MS. Addition of CeO2 in SiO2 support can not only promote dispersion of nickel species but also reduction of NiO species. Due to rapid transformation of valence state of nickel species under different reaction atmospheres in fluidized bed, activity and stability of the catalyst are improved. At 750 \u2103, conversions of CH4 over 5Ni/5CeO2-SiO2 catalyst(the mass fractions of Ni and Ce are all 5%)can reach 87%,which approaches thermodynamic equilibrium. The activity of catalyst can maintain for 15 h. The high activity and stability of catalyst may possibly attribute to interaction between Ni species and CeO2- SiO2 support.",

The carboxylic acids can be saturated, unsaturated or aromatic substituted alkanoic acid. The esters are straight-chain or cyclic ones, the latter mainly refer to \u03b3-butyrolactone, Meldrum's acid and their derivatives. Especially, the compounds of indanone or tetralone can be obtained by using \u03b3-butyrolactone, unsaturated carboxylic acid and Meldrum's acid as reactants in one-step by Friedel-Crafts reaction. These processes have high application value, but require further green. The further research to make Friedel-Crafts reactions green should be focused on developing new catalysts and studying the activation mechanism of reactants on the catalytic acid sites.",

A synergistic effect between Ni/H-USY and Pd element or Pt element enhanced the conversion of NO_x.

        "abstract": "The catalytic activities of Co-Al hydrotalcite and the addition of transition metal oxides in NO+CO reaction were examined with a microreactor-gas chromatography (GC) reaction system. Experimental results show that Co-Al with addition of Cu cation is with higher catalytic activity for NO + CO reaction, and the activity of Co-Cu-Al hydrotalcite is affected by the molar ratio of Co\u2236Cu\u2236Al. When nCo\u2236nCu\u2236nAl was equal to 5\u22363\u22361, the activity was the highest with 100% NO conversion at reaction temperature of 120 \u2103. There were two CuO diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 35.5\u00b0 and 38.7\u00b0 but not a spinel diffraction peaks after Co-Cu-Al (5\u22363\u22361) was calcined at 350 \u2103. But a small amount of spinel was formed after Co-Cu-Al being calcined at 450 \u2103 and the amount of spinel increased with calcination temperature, indicating that spinel formation affected NO reduction. As shown in NO-TPD-MS analysis, the thermal desorption products of NO absorbed on Co-Cu-Al are NO (m / e=30), N2O (m / e=44), N2 (m / e=28) and O2 (m / e=32). We suggest that the desorption species of NO occur at the weak positions of Co-Cu-Al in low temperature but at strong positions in high temperature. In addition, the desorption peak temperature of NO on Co-Cu-Al calcined at 400 \u2103 is slightly lower than that calcined at 600 \u2103, indicating that the dissociation of NO on the surface of Co-Cu-Al is a rate-determining step in NO + CO reaction.",

        "abstract": "Using Ce0.5Ti0.5O2 as carrier, CuO/Ce0.5Ti0.5O2 catalysts with different CuO loadings were prepared by the impregnation method. The catalytic activities of the catalysts for NO+CO reaction were examined with a micro-reactor gas chromatography reaction system and the catalysts were characterized by of TPR, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the activity of CuO/Ce0.5Ti0.5O2 for NO+CO reaction was depended on CuO loading, and became maximal when CuO loading was 22% and the calcined temperature was 500 \u2103. However, after calcination at 700 \u2103 14%CuO/Ce0.5Ti0.5O2 had the highest activity, possibly due to the formation of CeTi2O6-mixed oxide. The TPR analysis showed that CuO/Ce0.5Ti0.5O2 had four TPR reduction peaks (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 peaks). The \u03b1 and \u03b2 peaks were the reduction of highly dispersed CuO species; the \u03b3 peak was due to the isolated bulk CuO interacted intensively with Ce0.5Ti0.5O2; and the \u03b4 peak was due to the bulk CuO on the surface of CuO/Ce0.5Ti0.5O2. As shown by XRD, CuO/Ce0.5Ti0.5O2 calcined at 700 \u2103 had new oxide CeTi2O6, and the diffraction peaks of CeTi2O6 became obvious as the calcined temperature increased, indicating that high temperature enhanced solid reaction of Ce and Ti, and formation of CeTi2O6. The Raman results indicated that after calcination Ce0.5Ti0.5O2 was no longer a simple combination of TiO2 and CeO2, but had formed new crystal structure.",

Among the series of metal oxides as catalysts, \u03b3-Al2O3 exerts the highest activity. At 300 oC and the discharge power of 4.5 W, the NO conversion reaches 56.5% in the combination of plasma with \u03b3-Al2O3, much higher than that in pure plasma mode (28.9%). At this temperature, no conversion of NO or CH4 was observed in pure catalytic reaction with \u03b3-Al2O3 as the catalyst, indicating a synergistic function between the plasma and the catalyst. As further investigation shows, the catalytic activity has inverse correlation with dielectric constant on the whole. The porous structure and surface acidity of the catalysts obviously promote the plasma-assisted SCR of NO with CH4.",

By using the USY supported MnOx catalysts with Mn loading from 1%(wt.) to 15%(wt.), the selective catalyric reduction of NOx with CH4 as reductor in the presence of excess oxygen was investigated. During which, the FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) was used to analyses the concentration of the reactants and products of the reduction process. The results show that the conversion of NO to N2 is related to the loading of Mn on the supported MnOx catalyst and its maximum conversion rate of 20.8% can be reached over the H-USY supported MnOx catalyst with 5%(wt.) loading of Mn at 500\u2103. The experiments also show that when the reactor is successively and separately filled with two kinds of catalysts, Mn/H-USY and Ni/H-USY, the temperature window of NO conversion can be broadened (the conversion rate reaches 24.4%) and meanwhile the formation of N2O can be inhibited.",

The results show that the addition of silica is effective in suppressing \u03b1phase transformation and therefore, in maintaining large surface area of alumina after heating at elevated temperatures. The stabilization effect of the silica species increases with the rise of silica content, however, the overabundance of silica species weakens its stabilization effect. The preparation conditions influence the thermal stability of alumina and stabilization effect of silica. Employing solgel and supercritical drying methods, silica-doped alumina materials with high thermal stability were prepared using NaAlO2 and water-soluble sodium silicate.",

CH_x species (x=1-3) were observed on the catalyst with different Ni particle sizes when CH_4 was adsorbed on its surface. The CH_3-O species was also detected as the result of an interaction of CH_x species with surface hydroxyl groups. The dissociation of CH_4 depended intensively on the Ni particle size. CH_4 dissociated more easily on the Ni/SiO_2 catalyst with a Ni particle size of approximate 8 nm. CO_2 was very difficult to dissociate on the Ni/SiO_2 catalyst, while the adsorbed H from CH_4 dissociation promoted the dissociation of CO_2. Small Ni particles might be helpful to hydrogen overflow to the support for CO_2 activation. In co-adsorption of CH_4 and CO_2, the monodentate carbonate species was observed on the Ni/SiO_2 catalyst with smaller Ni particle size, which indicated that smaller Ni particles could promote the reaction of CO_2 with surface oxygen species.",

It was found that the types of plasma carrier gases exert great effect on the conversion of adsorbed NO(x). The conversion of adsorbed NO(x) is much lower in N(2) plasma than in Ar plasma, which is attributed to the reverse reaction, NO(x) formation reaction. The momentary increase of oxygen species derived from the decomposition of adsorbed NO(x) is considered to be the main cause as their collisions with nitrogen species can generate NO(x) again. Thus, solid carbon was added to the catalyst to act as a scavenger for active oxygen species to improve the conversion of adsorbed NO(x) in N(2) plasma. A NO(x) removal rate of 97.8% was obtained on 8.5wt.% carbon mixed H-ZSM-5 at an energy efficiency of 0.758 mmol NO(x)/W\u00b7h.",

The addition of CeZrO2 resulted in a significant improvement in the initial activity of the catalysis as well as an increase in the stability. The long-term activity of the promoted catalyst was dependent upon the rapid redox properties between the oxidative zone and the reductive zone in a fluidized bed reactor. H2 temperature-programmed reduction(H2-TPR) and temperature-programmed surface reaction(TPSR) studies demonstrated that addition of the CeZrO2 resulted in an increase in the reducibility and oxygen transfer ability of the support,Ni/Ce0.5ZrO0.5O2-SiO2 showed improved redox properties compared with Ni/SiO2 due to a low-temperature reduction. X-ray diffraction(XRD) of the fresh and spent catalysts showed that the promoter enhanced the nickel dispersion and retarded metal particle growth during reaction at high temperature,and surface Ni was gradually oxidized by remaining O2,leading to Ni deactivation.",

BET and XRD results show that the pore size distributions of 15%TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O3 were mainly between micro-pores and meso-pores, and the CuO crystal diffraction peaks were detected, respectively. By using a hybrid system integrating plasma activation and a 12%CuO/TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst, the reactions of NO+CH4+O2 were studied under different conditions including plasma only, catalyst only and plasma with catalyst. It is found that only plasma existed, the NO and CH4 conversion increased with a higher plasma power supply, and the addition of 2.5%O2 increased NO and CH4 conversion. Only when catalysts eristed, the NO and CH4 conversion both increased with the increase of temperature and reached 30% and 20%, respectively. And at the same time, the NO conversion was increased first with O2 content increasing and then decreased, and CH4 conversion was increased with O2 content increasing. When both plasma and catalyst coexisted, the conversion trend of the NO and CH4 with variation of O2 content was consistent with that when only catalyst existed. Besides, the NO conversion was in the range from 15% to 35% and the low temperature NO conversion was obviously increased. For the CH4 conversion, it was increased greatly to 90% .",

We prepared ruthenium based catalyst supported on functionalized MCM-41, and use it to the CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid. The results indicated that the immobilized ruthenium catalyst not only overcame the disadvantage of difficult separation from the reaction system and can be reusable, but also obtained higher activity than homogeneous counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Reducibility and characteristics of CuO/Sn0.8Ti0.2O2 catalysts were examined by using a microreactor-GC NO+CO reaction system, BET, TG-DTA, FTIR, XRD and H2-TPR techniques. CuO/Sn0.8Ti0.2O2 had high activity in NO+CO reaction, showing 93% NO conversion at 300 \u2103 in air, and 100% NO conversion at 225 \u2103 after H2 pretreatment. The pore size distribution of Sn0.8Ti0.2O2 was mainly as micro-pores and meso-pores (1~5 nm), and the specific surface area and total pore volume of Sn0.8Ti0.2O2 were 69 m2\u00b7g-1 and 0.15 cm3\u00b7g-1, respectively. As shown by XRD analysis, there was no CuO crystal diffraction peak at 9%CuO loading, but two CuO crystal diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 35.5\u00b0 and 38.7\u00b0 were present at 12% CuO loading. FTIR detected the adsorption of NO and CO on the surface of reduced 12%CuO/Sn0.8Ti0.2O2. The Cu2+ sites and support surface adsorbed NO, and the process of NO adsorption led to the formation of N2O and NO3-. In contrast, the Cu+?Cu0 sites and support surface adsorbed CO, and when the mixed gases of NO and CO were adsorbed by support surface, no NO3- was formed. H2-TPR showed four reduction peaks (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4). The \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 peaks were the reductions of CuO species, and the \u03b4 peak was the reduction of Sn0.8Ti0.2O2.",

When pretreated by air and H2, the catalysts had 100% NO conversion at 325 and 275 \u2103, respectively. The XRD analysis could only detect \u03b3-Al2O3 crystal diffraction and weak CuO crystal diffraction peaks after 15%CuO loading. There were two H2-TPR reduction peaks in CuO-TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O3, the \u03b1 peak due to the highly dispersed CuO which spread on \u03b3-Al2O3 surface and the other peak due to the highly dispersed CuO which dispersed on 15%TiO2/\u03b3-Al2O3 surface. The DRIFTS analysis showed that catalysts with pretreatment in air or H2 atmosphere adsorbed NO+CO gases, and the N2O adsorption peaks appeared at 200 and 150 \u2103,respectively.",

During the anodic oxidation process, various electrolytes were used to investigate the formation of porous membrane. And the catalytic performance of the catalysts was tested by using toluene and acetone combustion as model reaction. The temperatures of complete toluene and acetone conversion were decreased to 180 \u00b0C and 240 \u00b0C, respectively.

The results showed that super-critical could largely improve the conversion of aliphatic hydroxyl moieties, but could not conducive to the conversion of noncondensed phenolic hydroxyl moieties. Carboxylic acids were almost eliminated under all upgrading reaction conditions. The aliphatic hydroxyl moieties were more easily converted by using stronger acidic HZSM-5, and the amount of the noncondensed phenolic hydroxyl moieties decreased evidently by using weaker acidic HZSM-5 (Si/Al=300).",

        "abstract": "In the paper, we report for the first time that the conversion of renewable oils into diesel-like hydrocarbon mixtures can be realized on molybdenum carbides with high activity and selectivity. The molybdenum carbide catalyst exhibited much better resistance to leaching than noble metals and could be reused consecutively for sixteen times without deactivation. Mechanism investigations indicated that molybdenum carbide and palladium showed different reaction selectivities and it was speculated that the level of difficulty in acyl-to-alkyl rearrangement of surface acyl intermediates on molybdenum carbide and palladium resulted in the different product selectivity.

Keywords Ca/SBA-15 CaO Solid base Transesterification Biodiesel 1 Introduction Petrochemical sources such as coal and natural gases, which are finite and will be exhausted shortly, are supplying the majority of the energy needs of the world nowadays. The utilization of alternative renewable fuels is therefore being more and more attracting. Biodiesel, a mixture of alkyl esters obtained from vegetable or animal oils, is a promising nontoxic and biodegradable fuel arising from biomass [1,2] . Biodiesel is usually produced by the transesterification of triglycerides with methanol and/or ethanol in the presence of a catalyst [3] . Alkaline catalysts are more widely investigated because the rate of transesterification reactions catalyzed by alkaline catalysts is much faster than those of reactions catalyzed by the acid catalysts [4,5] . Homogeneous basic catalysts such as sodium or potassium hydroxide are conventionally used for the transesterification reaction because these traditional homogeneous catalysts have certain advantages, including high activity (complete conversion within 1 h) and mild reaction conditions (65 \u00b0C and 1 atm). However, the removal of these catalysts is technically difficult, and a large amount of wastewater was produced during biodiesel separation and cleaning [6] . Heterogeneous basic catalysts have been widely studied in the last decades in order to circumvent the difficulties with homogeneous catalysts. They have some outstanding advantages, such as simpler separation and no toxicity, no corrosion, or no environmental pollution [7] . Many kinds of solid bases have been investigated for this purpose, including alkali and alkali earth metal oxides [8,9] , rare earth metal oxides [10\u201313] , calcined hydrotalcites [14,15] , alkali earth metal oxide and rare earth metal oxide complexes [16,17] , zeolites [18] , anion exchanged resins [19,20] . A leaching problem has been raised up in most of the catalysts just in the past several years [8,9,21,22] . CaO is the most attractive catalyst among the insoluble alkali and alkali earth metal oxides because of its high transesterification activity [23\u201325] . A large amount of leached species, however, was also observed because of the formation of Ca diglyceroxide when glycerol is present [26] . Because extensive leaching may threaten the reusability and the environmental sustainability of catalyst, pure CaO seems not adaptable for industrial applications. Thus, it is important to investigate novel heterogeneous basic catalysts that are both active and stable for the transesterification reaction. New opportunities have been opened up in many areas of chemistry and material science since the discovery of mesoporous silica molecular sieves [27,28] . Due to its desirable features, e.g. tailorable pore size, high degree of structural ordering, ease of synthesis, larger pore size, thicker pore walls and higher hydrothermal/thermal stability, SBA-15 has been extensively studied in the last decade [29,30] . Nowadays, SBA-15 has achieved numerous applications in the fields of catalysis, adsorptions, separations, water purification, and advanced optical devices because of its unique physicochemical properties [31\u201336] . SBA-15 based solid strong bases have been widely studied in the field of catalysis because of their unique property [37\u201343] . Srivastava et al. synthesized cyclic carbonates by using adenine-modified Ti-SBA-15 solid base as a catalyst [37] . Sujandi et al. also successfully prepared the short-channeled amino-functionalized-SBA-15 catalysts with high performance in Knoevenagel and Claisen\u2013Schmidt condensations as well as in Henry reactions. Both organic and inorganic compounds, including amino [39] , magnesium [40,41] , and calcium [42] modified SBA-15 have been achieved by Zhu's group. Albuquerque et al. reported the first use of CaO/SBA-15 type solid base catalyst in biodiesel production, but the reusability of the catalyst was not reported [43] . It is worth noting that Mg and/or Ca modified SBA-15 solid base catalyst were all prepared by an impregnation-like method. This required two steps of calcination for the formation of solid base which of course led to more energy consumption. On the other hand, although solid strong/super bases can catalyze various reactions in mild conditions, their industrial applications are limited by the difficulties in synthesis and storage [44] . Thus, preparation of less strong but more stable solid bases seems more promising in industrial applications. Here, we present a one-pot synthesis method to prepare calcium loaded SBA-15 solid base. The physicochemical properties of the resultant materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 adsorption, transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM), thermogravimetric analyzers (TG), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and CO 2 -temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) techniques. For comparison, Ca/SBA-15 was also synthesized by the impregnation method (0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM). The catalytic activity of these catalysts was tested by the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with methanol. The differences between samples prepared by the two methods were also identified and discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation Ca/SBA-15 samples were synthesized according to standard literature procedures [29,30] . In a typical synthesis, 2 g of triblock copolymer P123 was first dissolved in 75 g of 1.6 M HCl, then a calculated amount of Ca(NO 3 ) 2 was added under stirring for 0.5 h. Thereafter, 4.25 g of TEOS was added under stirring at 40 \u00b0C. The resultant solution was stirred for 24 h at 40 \u00b0C, then transferred to a 100 ml autoclave and heated at 120 \u00b0C for another 24 h under static condition. Finally, the mixture was evaporated in a rotating evaporator under 55 \u00b0C and calcined at 550 \u00b0C in air for 6 h. The obtained sample was denoted as x Ca/SBA-15 where x represents the Ca/Si atomic ratio. For comparison, another Ca/SBA-15 sample was synthesized by an incipient impregnation (IM) procedure. First, SBA-15 was synthesized by the same procedure but without the introducing of Ca(NO 3 ) 2 . Then the SBA-15 sample calcined at 550 \u00b0C in air for 6 h was introduced into a calculated amount of Ca(NO 3 ) 2 aqueous solution. After 1 h, the resultant mixture was dried at 120 \u00b0C overnight and finally calcined at 550 \u00b0C in air for 6 h. The obtained sample was denoted as x Ca/SBA-15-IM where x represents the Ca/Si atomic ratio. 2.2 Sample characterization XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a RIGAKU D/MAX 2550/PC diffractometer using Cu K \u03b11 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.540 56 \u00c5) at 40 kV and 100 mA, over a 2 \u03b8 range of 0.5\u20134.0\u00b0 with a resolution of 0.02\u00b0 at a scanning speed of 6\u00b0/min. The phases were identified using the power diffraction file (PDF) database (JCPDS, International Centre for Diffraction Data). FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded on a Nicolet MAGNAIR-560 spectrometer in the range of 400\u20134000 cm \u22121 with a resolution of 4 cm \u22121 . A standard KBr technique was used for the sample preparation. Raman spectra were acquired with a 325 nm line of a He\u2013Cd laser (LabRAM, HR-800) with a resolution of 2 cm \u22121 at room temperature. The incident laser power at the sample was 2 mW. The morphologies and dimensions of materials were observed by SEM (HITACHI S-4700) and TEM (JEOL-2020F) using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The structures of the modified supports were measured by N 2 adsorption at 196 \u00b0C using an OMNISORP 100CX system (Coulter Co., USA). All samples were pretreated at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h in high vacuum. Pore size distribution, pore volume and its surface area were calculated on the isotherm of adsorption by a Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda method. CO 2 -TPD was used to determine the basic strength and basicity of the samples. About 0.05 g of activated catalyst was filled in a silica tube (ca. 4 mm i.d.), treated at 550 \u00b0C for 1 h in Ar (20 ml/min), and CO 2 was then introduced for 1 h at room temperature. After purging with Ar for 1 h to remove CO 2 in the gas phase, the sample was heated from room temperature to 800 \u00b0C with a ramp of 10 \u00b0C/min and the desorbed CO 2 was detected with a mass analyzer (Dymaxion Mass Spectrometer, AMETEK, the mass signal at m / z 44 was used to determine the amount of desorbed CO 2 ). 2.3 Transesterification reaction All experiments were performed in a 100 ml autoclave. It was charged with 10 g of sunflower oil (other oils as well), 10 g of anhydrous methanol (stoichiometrically 1:27), and 0.5 g of catalyst (5 wt.% of oil). The solid\u2013oil\u2013methanol mixture was heated to 200 \u00b0C under magnetic agitation. After a transesterification reaction time of 8 h, the mixture was filtered to remove the catalyst and the residual methanol was separated from the upper liquid phase (the lower phase is glycerin) via rotary evaporation. After that, the reaction products were washed three times with distilled water for removal of the formed glycerin. Products were analyzed by reserved-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, Agilent 1100 Series) with a C18 Hypersil BDS column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle size) using UV/visible detection at 210 nm [12,45] . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physicochemical properties of Ca/SBA-15 samples Fig. 1 shows the small-angle XRD (SAXRD) patterns of SBA-15, of Ca/SBA-15 samples with Ca/Si atomic ratio varied from 0.1 to 0.5 and of 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM sample. All the Ca/SBA-15 samples showed the optimal ordering of the 2D-hexagonal P 6 mm structure [27] , indicating that a good preservation of the ordered mesoporous of SBA-15 silica can be achieved even at the Ca/Si ratio of 0.5 with one-pot synthesis method. But the intensity of all reflections decreased with the increased Ca content, which was probably caused by the decreasing scatter contrast between pore walls and pore space with the introduction of metal oxides [42] . It is worth noting that the SAXRD intensity of 0.3Ca/SBA-15 was much stronger than that of 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM, indicating that the ordered mesopores of SBA-15 silica are more easily to be preserved with one-pot synthesis procedure rather than incipient impregnation procedure. The N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of SBA-15, Ca/SBA-15 and 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM samples are presented in Fig. 2 . The isotherms of all the Ca/SBA-15 samples were of type IV with an H1 hysteresis loop, very similar to that of SBA-15. This gives very strong evidence that pure silica SBA-15 and all Ca/SBA-15 and Ca/SBA-15-IM samples have ordered mesoporous structures [46] . The position of the inflections slightly shifted toward smaller p / p 0 values, and the amount of adsorbed N 2 decreased, which was due to the loading of calcium in SBA-15. As shown in Table 1 , both the surface area and the pore volume decreased gradually with the increasing amount of calcium in the samples. The surface area and the pore volume of 0.3Ca/SBA-15 are also larger than that of 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM. The long-range channel ordering can also be characterized by TEM technique. Fig. 3 illustrates the representative TEM images of SBA-15, 0.3Ca/SBA-15 and 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM samples. The meso-structure was preserved in both 0.3Ca/SBA-15 and 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM samples, consistent with the results of XRD and N 2 adsorption. The surfaces of 0.3Ca/SBA-15 are much like those of SBA-15, indicating the well distribution of calcium on the support SBA-15. Nevertheless, the surfaces of 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM seemed like to be covered by clouds which were caused by the overloading of calcium. This phenomenon suggests that one-pot synthesis of Ca-containing SBA-15 is much better than incipient impregnation method, at least in view of gaining a well dispersed material. The morphology and surface properties of Ca/SBA-15 materials were also characterized by SEM and SEM-EDS. As seen in Fig. 4 , 0.3Ca/SBA-15 was in better orientation than 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM, supporting our results of XRD, N 2 adsorption and TEM. In the SEM-EDS results, the surface Ca/Si ratio of 0.3Ca/SBA-15 is 0.27, lower than that of 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM which is 0.30. This can be explained by the good dispersion of calcium in both the surface and bulk of 0.3Ca/SBA-15. However, it is important to point out that there was still a large amount of Cl \u2212 ion (Cl/Ca atomic ratio = 0.33) detected on the surface of 0.3Ca/SBA-15. These Cl \u2212 ions were introduced by the using of HCl as an acidic source, and would probably lead to the formation of CaCl 2 after calcinations. The TG-DTA curves of SBA-15, 0.3Ca/SBA-15 and 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM samples are shown in Fig. 5 . In the scan of SBA-15, the weight losses were concentrated in the range of 130\u2013240 \u00b0C, and could be assigned to the decomposition of P123. The TG curve of the investigated 0.3Ca/SBA-15 sample was concentrated in two ranges (50\u2013120 \u00b0C, 360\u2013590 \u00b0C). The peak around 100 \u00b0C was assigned to the loss of physical adsorbed H 2 O, while the other two peaks at 420 and 460 \u00b0C could be attributed to the decomposition of Ca(NO 3 ) 2 . Interestingly, the DTG curve of 0.3Ca/SBA-15 showed several maxima at 250\u2013450 \u00b0C which were not found in the scans of SBA-15 and 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM, indicating that Ca/SBA-15 samples prepared by one-pot synthesis procedure requires lower temperature for the decomposition of Ca(NO 3 ) 2 . Infrared spectra were used to characterize the surface property of materials [47] . Fig. 6 shows the FTIR spectra of SBA-15 and Ca/SBA-15 materials calcined at 550 \u00b0C. The broad transmission band at approximately 3420 cm \u22121 could be attributed to the OH stretching vibration, while the one near 1630 cm \u22121 was associated with the bending mode of OH groups of physically adsorbed water [48] . It is noteworthy that the peaks at 1498 and 1438 cm \u22121 that corresponded to CO 3 2\u2212 symmetric stretching vibration band [49] were detected in the 0.4\u20130.5Ca/SBA-15 samples, while they were absent in the samples with the Ca/Si ratio of lower than 0.3. The increased intensity of both OH \u2212 and CO 3 2\u2212 groups indicates the enhanced basic strength with the increased Ca loading amount in Ca/SBA-15 samples [49] . A weak but sharp peak developed at 1384 cm \u22121 in the spectrum of 0.1Ca/SBA-15 and 0.2Ca/SBA-15 sample, which could be designated to the vibration of N\u2013O of nitrate [50] . This was probably caused by the incomplete decomposition of Ca(NO 3 ) 2 . The band in the range of 1050\u20131100 cm \u22121 is assigned to vibration of Si\u2013O bond [51,52] , and the peak in the samples is somewhat red-shifted as the amount of added Ca increases, which indicates the interaction between calcium and silicon. 3.2 Basic properties of 0.3Ca/SBA-15 and 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM samples CO 2 -TPD can be used to determine the basic strength and basicity of materials. In principle, the higher the CO 2 desorption temperature and the desorption rate are, the stronger basicity and basic strength the material has [40\u201342] . The CO 2 -TPD profiles of SBA-15, 0.3Ca/SBA-15 and 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM samples are displayed in Fig. 7 . Only one CO 2 desorption peak at 120 \u00b0C was found in the SBA-15 sample, indicating that SBA-15 sample has only weak basic sites, which corresponding to the interaction of CO 2 with SiO 2 species [42] . With the loading of Ca, both the 0.3Ca/SBA-15 and 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM sample showed stronger basic properties than SBA-15, but they were very different in the form of basic sites. There were new CO 2 desorption peaks at 220 \u00b0C in the profiles of both the 0.3Ca/SBA-15 and the 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM sample. These medium basic sites were probably caused by the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of CaSiO 3 species [53,54] . It is worth noting that another peak in the range of 500\u2013800 \u00b0C was detected in the 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM sample. This new peak is assigned to strong basic sites; it can be explained by the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of isolated CaO species which is a super base [42] . Interestingly, there were no strong basic sites in the 0.3Ca/SBA-15 sample. This can be explained by the fact that there were only SiO 2 and CaSiO 3 species in the 0.3Ca/SBA-15 sample. It is well-known that CaO is a strong/super base, while CaSiO 3 is a salt with medium basic sites; thus the 0.3Ca/SBA-15 and 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM samples appeared with different CO 2 adsorption properties. Accordingly, a schematic diagram of basic sites formation on SBA-15 by the two different methods was proposed ( Scheme 1 ). In the one-pot synthesis procedure, Ca 2+ was well dispersed in the silica framework before calcination, noting that there are many Si\u2013OH groups on the surface of silica framework. After being activated at 550 \u00b0C, the well dispersed Ca 2+ easily reacted with silica species to form CaSiO 3 species though a certain amount of CaCl 2 was also formed. In the impregnation procedure, however, CaSiO 3 are much harder to be formed not only due to the loss of surface Si\u2013OH groups at the first step calcinations, but also to the lower dispersion degree of Ca 2+ on the silica framework. The basic strengths of different samples were summarized in Table 2 . The amount of total basic sites of 0.3Ca/SBA-15 is 78.6 \u03bcmol/g, slightly less than that of 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM (91.4 \u03bcmol/g). This shortage of total basic sites was mainly due to the 29.0 \u03bcmol/g strong basic sites in the 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM sample. However, the amount of medium basic sites (220 \u00b0C) of 0.3Ca/SBA-15 reached 52.8 \u03bcmol/g, more than that of 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM (38.4 \u03bcmol/g). With the increasing loading of calcium, the amount of medium basic sites (220 \u00b0C) of x Ca/SBA-15 samples increased dramatically, and reached 88.1 \u03bcmol/g in the 0.5Ca/SBA-15 sample. There were, however, only a small number of strong basic sites in all these samples. This was probably caused by the preferred formation of CaSiO 3 species rather than CaO species due to the good dispersion of calcium on silica skeleton by one-pot synthesis method. 3.3 Influence of Ca/Si ratio on the transesterification reaction Table 3 also displays the catalytic activity of Ca/SBA-15 catalysts in the transesterification reaction. The reaction was carried out under the conditions mentioned in Section 2.3 . Pure SBA-15 only showed a very weak catalytic activity on the transesterification reaction, similar to the results for the condition of no catalyst. The biodiesel yields were basically related to the basic property of Ca/SBA-15 catalyst. As the Ca/Si ratio increased from 0.1 to 0.5, biodiesel yield increased until reaching its maxima of 99.1%. It is worth noting that 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM sample showed a better catalytic activity than that of 0.3 Ca/SBA-15 which was probably due to its higher basicity. 3.4 Influence of reaction temperature on the transesterification reaction The influence of reaction temperature on the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil was also studied. As shown in Fig. 8 , all the catalysts showed a very low activity at 60 \u00b0C. With a higher reaction temperature, the catalytic activity of all catalysts increased. A 99.1% biodiesel yield was achieved on the 0.5Ca/SBA-15 catalyst at 200 \u00b0C. Further increase in the reaction temperature would cause more energy use, so the reaction temperature was set to 200 \u00b0C in this study. 3.5 Influence of water and FFAs content on the transesterification reaction Generally, water and FFAs contained in the oils would inhibit the transesterification activity of the basic catalysts because they are sensitive to moisture and acids. Therefore, the durability of a catalyst in a water and FFA containing reaction system is somewhat important. In this study, the reaction rate was measured in the presence of water and FFAs (palmitic acid) by using 0.5Ca/SBA-15 as a catalyst. As seen from Fig. 9 , the catalytic activity was not affected by a water amount of lower than 5%. And 76% of biodiesel yield still can be achieved when 10% of water was added to the sunflower oil. Noting that a water content of lower than 5% can be easily obtained in an industrial process, the 0.5Ca/SBA-15 catalyst is thus suitable for transesterification reaction. It can also be seen that a certain amount of FFA (3%) did not affect the catalytic activity of 0.5Ca/SBA-15, though further increase of FFA content would decrease the catalytic activity. Especially when 10% of FFA was added, the catalytic activity dramatically decreased to as low as 10%. Therefore, if the oils contain a large amount of FFAs, an esterification step for FFAs will still be needed for this catalytic system. 3.6 Deactivation and regeneration of catalysts The catalysts were simply treated by separating; the remainders were washed thoroughly with methanol, and dried in an oven. Up to five cycles of different catalysts were performed on the transesterification of sunflower oil. As shown in Fig. 10 , no deactivation was found on the one-pot synthesized Ca/SBA-15 catalyst, indicating that Ca/SBA-15 catalysts were very stable in the tested cycles, while a dramatic decrease of catalytic activity was found on the 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM catalyst. As mentioned above, calcium species can more easily to form CaO in 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM while CaSiO 3 can more easily be formed in 0.3Ca/SBA-15. Thus, the interaction between calcium species and SBA-15 support in 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM catalyst was not as strong as in the 0.3Ca/SBA-15 sample. Although 0.3Ca/SBA-15-IM catalyst showed a better activity in transesterification of sunflower oil in the first run, it quickly deactivated in the second run. This indicates that Ca/SBA-15 catalyst prepared by one-pot synthesis method had a better stability; this result was caused by the better distribution of calcium species and enhanced interaction of calcium species with silica walls. One thing to be noted here is that the Ca/SBA-15 catalyst showed a much lower catalytic activity than the values for pure CaO reported in many research papers [23\u201326] . This may be explained by the better solubility of CaO in methanol and/or glycerol compared with CaSiO 3 . Thus, the homogeneous system contributed to activity more than the heterogeneous system in the transesterification reaction when using CaO as a catalyst [25] , which of course faces the leaching problem. CaO can easily be transformed into Ca(OH) 2 and CaCO 3 when exposed in air, as well as Ca(OCH 3 ) 2 and calcium diglyceroxide in the transesterification reaction system [26] . The instability of CaO restricts its applications in biodiesel production. In the practical application point of view, Ca/SBA-15 catalyst is better than CaO and than supported CaO prepared by impregnated method. For the transesterification reaction, it is important to find a more stable catalyst rather than a more active catalyst. 3.7 Transesterification of different vegetable oils The behaviors of 0.3Ca/SBA-15 and 0.5Ca/SBA-15 catalysts in transesterification of different vegetable oils are shown in Fig. 11 . Slight differences were observed as a function of the nature of the vegetable oil. Soybean oil was found to be the most active in the studied vegetable oils. 4 Conclusions Ca/SBA-15 samples were prepared by a convenient one-pot synthesis method. The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 was well preserved with Ca/Si ratio up to 0.5. Compared with Ca/SBA-15 sample prepared by impregnation method, the Ca/SBA-15 showed not only a better calcium species distribution, but also higher BET surface area and larger medium basic strength. Moreover, Ca/SBA-15 prepared by one-pot synthesis method requires less material and energy costs. When used in the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with methanol, a biodiesel yield of as high as 99.1% was achieved on the 0.5Ca/SBA-15 catalyst calcined at 550 \u00b0C at a reaction temperature of 200 \u00b0C for 8 h. At the meantime, no deactivation was found after five cycles on Ca/SBA-15 sample prepared by one-pot synthesis method in the transesterification reaction. This showed a much better stability than that of the sample prepared by a conventional impregnation method. Besides, a water content of up to 5% and/or a free fatty acids (FFAs) content of 3% did not affect the catalytic activity of Ca/SBA-15 catalyst in the transesterification reaction, indicating that Ca/SBA-15 catalyst prepared by one-pot synthesis method will be a promising heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production.

Keywords CO 2 -TPD Ca 3 SiO 5 Solid base Biodiesel Transesterification 1 Introduction Alternative renewable fuels have attracted considerable attentions recent years since traditional fossil fuels will be exhausted shortly. Biodiesel produced from vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, soybean and palm oil is one of the most promising forms of renewable energy. First generation of biodiesel (FGB) is usually produced via transesterification of vegetable oils with methanol/ethanol catalyzed by acid, base or enzyme [1,2] . Non catalytic supercritical fluid (SCF) of methanol/ethanol conditions is also used in the production of FGB [3,4] . These products were defined as fatty acid methyl/ethyl esters (FAME/FAEE). Second generation of biodiesel (SGB), produced via hydrodeoxygenation approach, has attracted some interest recently because it has the same components as diesel fuel [5] . During all these processes, acid and enzyme catalyzed transesterification usually required long reaction time while the SGB process required high reaction temperature. Thus, base catalyzed transesterification is still the most attractive process to date. Homogeneous basic catalysts such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are commercially used for the transesterification reaction\u00a0 [6] . Although they have certain advantages including high activity and mild reaction conditions, steps of catalysts removal and biodiesel separation and purification will produce a large amount of waste water. Heterogeneous basic catalysts have been widely investigated in the last decade in order to resolve the problems with homogeneous basic catalysts [7\u201312] . These catalysts include alkali and alkali earth metal oxides [7,8] , rare earth metal oxides [9] , hydrotalcites [10] , zeolites [11] and resins [12] . Among all these heterogeneous bases, CaO is the most attractive one not only because of its high activity but also the low cost of catalyst preparation [13\u201318] . However, Granados et al. found that CaO is soluble in methanol and larger amount of leached species was observed when glycerol is present [15] . Thus, pure CaO or supported CaO seems not adaptable for industrial applications. Recently, some catalysts have been investigated to enhance the stability of CaO, including MgO supported on CaO [19] , CaO\u2013ZnO mixed oxide [20] and CaO\u2013ZrO 2 mixed oxide [21] . Previous work has found that better calcium species distribution could be achieved on Ca/SBA-15 catalyst by using a one-pot hydrothermal method compared with traditional impregnation method [22] . Here, we present the one-pot hydrothermal method to prepare rod-like Ca x SiO x + 2 mixed oxide catalysts. The physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N 2 adsorption, and CO 2 -temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) techniques. The catalytic activity of these catalysts was tested by the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol under methanol reflux or room temperature. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts with Ca/Si molar ratio of 1, 2, 3 and 4 were synthesized according to standard literature procedures [23,24] . In a typical synthesis, 2 g of triblock copolymer P123 was first dissolved in 75 g of 1.6 M HCl, then a calculated amount of Ca(NO 3 ) 2 was added under stirring for 0.5 h. Thereafter, 4.25 g of TEOS was added under stirring at 40 \u00b0C. The resultant solution was stirred for 24 h at 40 \u00b0C, then transferred to a 100 ml autoclave and heated at 120 \u00b0C for another 24 h under static condition. Finally, the mixture was evaporated in a rotating evaporator under 55 \u00b0C. As synthesized catalysts were then kept in a vacuum dryer. Before transesterification reaction, catalysts were calcined at 550 \u00b0C in air for 6 h. 2.2 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a RIGAKU D/MAX 2550/PC diffractometer using Cu K \u03b11 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.540 56 \u00c5) at 40 kV and 100 mA, over a 2 \u03b8 range of 10\u201380\u00b0 with a resolution of 0.02\u00b0 at a scanning speed of 6\u00b0 min \u2212 1 . The morphologies and dimensions of materials were observed by TEM (JEOL-2020 F) using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The structures of the modified catalysts were measured by N 2 adsorption at 196 \u00b0C on a Micromeritics ASAP 3020 M and Tristar system. All samples were pretreated at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h in high vacuum. Pore size distribution, pore volume and its surface area were calculated on the isotherm of adsorption by a Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda method. CO 2 -TPD was used to determine the basic strength and basicity of the samples. About 0.05 g of activated catalyst was filled in a silica tube (ca. 4 mm i.d.), treated at 550 \u00b0C for 1 h in Ar (20 ml min \u2212 1 ), and CO 2 was then introduced for 1 h at room temperature. After purging with Ar for 1 h to remove CO 2 in the gas phase, the sample was heated from room temperature to 800 \u00b0C with a ramp of 10 \u00b0C\u00b7min \u2212 1 and the desorbed CO 2 was detected with a mass analyzer (Dymaxion Mass Spectrometer, AMETEK, the mass signal at m / z 44 was used to determine the amount of desorbed CO 2 ). 2.3 Transesterification reaction All experiments were performed in a 50 ml round bottom flask. It was charged with 10 g of soybean oil (acidity, 0.16 mg KOH/g oil), 5 g of anhydrous methanol (methanol/oil molar ratio 13:1), and 0.5 g of catalyst (5% wt. of oil). The solid\u2013oil\u2013methanol mixture was heated to 65 \u00b0C under magnetic agitation. Intermediate and final biodiesel products consisted of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. They were analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, Agilent 1100 Series) with a C18 Hypersil BDS column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle size) using UV/Visible detection at 210 nm [25,26] . Leaching tests were performed in the same procedure of transesterification reaction by detecting the calcium concentration in methanol phase using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, IRIS Intrepid II XSP, Thermo Electron Co.). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physicochemical properties of Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts Fig.\u00a01 shows the XRD patterns of Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts calcined at 550 \u00b0C. Mainly CaSiO 3 and Ca 2 SiO 4 phase were detected on CaSiO 3 and Ca 2 SiO 4 catalyst respectively, indicating that calcium silicate can be easily formed even at low calcination temperature by using this hydrothermal approach [27,28] . When the Ca/Si molar ratio increased to 3, almost pure Ca 3 SiO 5 phase was formed on Ca 3 SiO 5 catalyst [29\u201331] . It is worth to note that the main phase formed in Ca 4 SiO 6 catalyst was Ca 3 SiO 5 with a trace amount of CaO. This suggested that an excess amount of calcium would lead to the incomplete reaction between calcium and silicate species. The textual properties of Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts were shown in Table S1 . The BET surface area of CaSiO 3 was as high as 144 m 2 \u00b7g \u2212 1 . However, when Ca/Si molar ratio increased, the BET surface areas of Ca 2 SiO 4 , Ca 3 SiO 5 and Ca 4 SiO 6 decreased drastically. The BET surface areas of Ca 2 SiO 4 , Ca 3 SiO 5 and Ca 4 SiO 6 were 13.7, 10.4 and 10.6 respectively. The N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts were also shown in Fig. S1 . Only the isotherm of CaSiO 3 sample was of type IV with an H1 hysteresis loop, indicating that the ordered mesoporous structure can be only preserved on CaSiO 3 sample [22] . Further increase in the Ca/Si molar ratio would cause structure destruction. The morphologies of Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts were characterized by using TEM technique, results are shown in Fig.\u00a02 . The meso-structure was preserved in CaSiO 3 . However, unequal particle sizes were observed on the Ca 2 SiO 4 sample. These results were consistent with the N 2 adsorption results. When Ca/Si molar ratio increased to 3, Ca 3 SiO 5 sample were mainly in rod-like morphology. Interestingly, even longer rods with mean length of 1.1 \u03bcm were achieved on the Ca 4 SiO 6 sample. 3.2 Basic properties of Ca x SiO x + 2 samples calcined at 550 \u00b0C The basic properties including basic strength and basicity of a material are generally correlated with the CO 2 desorption temperature and desorption rate, which can be determined by CO 2 -TPD technique [10,32] . Fig.\u00a03 displays the CO 2 -TPD profiles of Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts calcined at 550 \u00b0C. All samples exhibited only one CO 2 desorption peak at 620 \u00b0C which could be assigned to strong basic sites. The basic strength did not affected by the loading amount of calcium. However, with the increase of Ca/Si molar ratio, the amount of basic sites of Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts drastically increased till reach their maxima on Ca 4 SiO 6 catalyst. This phenomenon indicates that the basic sites were mainly generated on calcium species. 3.3 Transesterification reaction on Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts Fig.\u00a04 displays the transesterification reaction on different Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts under methanol reflux as a function of reaction time. As can be seen, only a FAME yield of 10% was achieved on CaSiO 3 even the reaction time was extended to 5 h. The FAME yields increased with the increasing Ca/Si molar ratio, and reached their maxima on Ca 4 SiO 6 . It is worth to note that Ca 3 SiO 5 and Ca 4 SiO 6 catalysts showed different pathways in the transesterification reaction. Although a FAME yield of 99% could be achieved on Ca 3 SiO 5 in 5 h, it seems that this catalyst needs to be activated in the first 2 h, at which time FAME yield only reached 24%. However, the FAME yields achieved on Ca 4 SiO 6 were 82% in 1 h and 95% in 2 h. And no activation step was needed for Ca 4 SiO 6 catalyst (or the catalyst was activated quickly in this reaction system). Recently, leaching problems of solid base catalysts have been raised by many authors [33] . They stated that some of the solid base catalysts actually played homogeneous roles in the transesterification reaction while some were mixed homogeneous and heterogeneous. Thus, the reaction mechanism of the Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts were further studied by leaching test. As shown in Fig. S2 , calcium concentrations were only 0.07 and 0.09 mg ml \u2212 1 in a reaction time of 1 and 2 h on Ca 3 SiO 5 catalyst. While, a calcium concentration of as high as 0.3 mg ml \u2212 1 was found in 5 h. Unlike Ca 3 SiO 5 , a much higher calcium concentration (0.18 mg ml \u2212 1 ) was detected in 1 h on Ca 4 SiO 6 , indicating that leaching of calcium species occurred easier on Ca 4 SiO 6 than Ca 3 SiO 5 . These results can be correlated with the catalytic activity, which is that the higher leaching amount of calcium leads to higher FAME yield. Thus, we can conclude that Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts played mainly homogeneous role in this system. 3.4 Transesterification reaction on Ca x SiO x + 2 catalysts at room temperature The catalytic activities of Ca 3 SiO 5 and Ca 4 SiO 6 catalysts were further investigated at room temperature, results are shown in Fig.\u00a05 . Same trends were found on these two catalysts. As expected, longer reaction time was needed for both catalysts to complete the transesterification reaction. However, a FAME yield of ca. 80% can still be achieved on Ca 4 SiO 6 in 10 h. For comparison, reaction was also carried out at room temperature by using NaOH as a homogeneous catalyst. Not surprisingly, higher FAME yields can be achieved when using NaOH as a catalyst compared with Ca 4 SiO 6 . This is mainly due to the faster reaction rate of homogeneous reactions than heterogeneous ones. However, the catalytic activity of Ca 4 SiO 6 was not much lower than NaOH which made Ca 4 SiO 6 a promising catalyst for industrial applications. 3.5 Deactivation and regeneration of catalysts The Ca 4 SiO 6 catalyst was simply treated by separating, washing thoroughly with methanol, and drying in an oven. No deactivation was found on the catalyst in the first 3 runs ( Table S2 ). However, FAME yields drastically decreased to 78.3% and 46.8% in the fourth and fifth run respectively. This was probably caused by the leaching problem of calcium species which led to the loss of calcium sites in Ca 4 SiO 6 catalyst. 4 Conclusions Rod-like Ca x SiO x + 2 solid base catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal method. The catalysts were successively used in the biodiesel production via transesterification reaction of soybean oil with methanol. Under the optimum reaction conditions, FAME yield of up to 95% was achieved on the Ca 4 SiO 6 catalyst calcined at 550 \u00b0C.

Characterizations with Raman, XRD, N2-TGA, SEM, TEM and HAADF-STEM confirmed that Mo2C nanoparticles were successfully supported on the carbon nanofibers. The optimal reaction conditions with model compounds on Mo2C/CNF had a conversion of 98.03% and yield of 95.26%. It is interesting to note that a low evaporation rate positions the Mo2C nanoparticles on the outside of the CNF due to the capillary effect and the Mo2C nanoparticles on the outside of the CNFs showed high catalytic activity compared to ones on the inside of the CNFs. The Mo2C/CNF catalyst was recycled 5 times without any apparent loss of catalytic activity. Catalytic performances of Mo2C/CNF, Mo 2C/AC (activated carbon) and Mo2C/CNT (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) were examined using methyl palmitate and maize oil. The results showed that molybdenum carbide could be a potential substitute for noble metals in transformation of vegetable oils. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC)-supported molybdenum carbide catalysts were successfully prepared in one pot using a solvent-evaporation-induced self-assembly strategy accompanied by a carbothermal hydrogen reduction reaction. Characterization with nitrogen sorption, small-angle XRD, and TEM confirmed that the obtained materials had high surface areas, large pore volumes, ordered mesoporous structures, narrow pore size distributions, and uniform dispersions of molybdenum carbide particles. With nitrogen replaced by hydrogen in the carbothermal reduction reaction, the formation temperature of molybdenum carbide could be reduced by more than 100 \u00b0C. By changing the amount of molybdenum precursor added from less than 2 % to more than 5 %, molybdenum carbide structures could be easily regulated from Mo(2) C to MoC. The catalytic performance of OMC-supported molybdenum carbide catalysts was evaluated by hydrodeoxygenation of vegetable oils. Compared with Mo(2)C, MoC exhibited high product selectivity and excellent resistance to leaching in the conversion of vegetable oils into diesel-like hydrocarbons.",

The result shows that the right amount of Sm2O3 can promote the adsorption of the surface oxygen and recovery of CuO-\ufffd\ufffd-Al2O3 catalyst. Sm2O3 plays an important role in change of \ufffd\ufffd-Al2O3 phase into \ufffd\ufffd-Al2O3 phase. In addition, the right amount of Sm2O3(5%) can improve the oxidation activity of the CuO-\ufffd\ufffd-Al2O3 catalyst. Whereas an excess of Sm2O3(10%) makes the CuO crystal in CuO-\ufffd\ufffd-Al2O3 catalyst become bigger and restrain the oxidation activity of the CuO-\ufffd\ufffd-Al2O3 catalyst.",

SAXRD, WAXRD, N adsorption-desorption, TEM techniques were used to characterize the above bifunctional catalysts. These bifunctional catalysts were applied to the reaction of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-derived phenol (PhOH) to produce cyclohexane fuel and showed very good catalytic performances. There were strong synergies between the metal sites and the acid sites on the bifunctional catalysts. This reaction of phenol HDO provides a model system for the catalytic upgrading of biomass-derived fuel.",

The results of the temperature-programmed surface reaction of CH indicated that GdO might enhance anti-carbon deposition properties.

Raman results suggested that the order of graphitization of deposited carbon decreases with the addition of GdO.",

Carbon nanospheres, which can be simply synthesized via hydrothermal carbonization and whose morphology can be easily controlled, were employed as supports to study the relationship between the graphitization degree of carbon supports and the hydrodeoxygenation activity of supported molybdenum carbide catalysts. Ferric chloride was employed as a graphitization reagent to modify the surface properties of the carbon nanospheres. Graphitized carbon nanosphere materials with appropriate FeCl3 to carbon ratios (1\u201350%) showed outstanding properties to work as supports for Mo2C catalysts. Suitable reaction conditions for comparing these catalysts were found out by testing carbon nanosphere supported Mo2C catalysts with different loadings (5\u201340%) at several temperatures (513\u2013553 K) and initial hydrogen pressures (2.0\u20133.0 MPa). The best conversion and hydrocarbon yield they reached were 91.1% and 88.3%, which were 21% and 31% higher than the results from the ungraphitized carbon nanosphere supported catalyst under the same conditions, respectively. Cellulose-derived carbon materials might be competitive with carbon nanotubes as catalyst supports in the field of hydrodeoxygenation and maybe in other areas.",

It was found that the dielectric properties and morphology of packing dielectric pellets play important roles in the reaction due to their influence on the electron energy distribution in the plasma. The acid\u2013base properties of the packing materials also affect the reaction through the chemisorption of CO on basic sites of the materials. Heterogeneous reactions on the solid surfaces of the dielectric materials also play a role in the reaction, which was also confirmed through the investigation of the influence of the discharge length on the reaction. The reverse reaction of CO decomposition, the oxidation of CO, was also investigated to further understand the role of dielectric materials in the plasma and their effect on plasma reactions. Both the decomposition of CO and the oxidation of CO in non-packed or dielectric packed reactors are first-ordered.",

Methods From June 2006 to October 2007, 101 510 staff members of Kailuan Co. Ltd participated in health examination and completed unified questionnaires. All participants underwent 12-lead electrocardiogram and physical examination. The prevalence of AF and its relationship with blood pressure were calculated and analysed by Logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 81 061 in 81 103 male participants accomplished electrocardiogram. Three hundred and ninety-eight were diagnosed with AF (37 valvular AF and 361 non-valvular AF) and the prevalence of AF was 0.49%. The prevalence of non-valvular AF in hypertensive population was significantly higher than that of the normotensives (0.54% vs 0.36%, P<0.01). The univariate Logistic regression analysis showed that the risks of AF in the population with systolic blood pressure (SBP) 120-<140 and \u2265140 mm Hg were respectively 1.44 and 3.58 times that of SBP<120 mm Hg. The prevalence of AF in the population with pulse pressure (PP) 50-<60 and \u226560 mm Hg was respectively 1.55, 2.11 times that of PP<40 mm Hg. After the adjustment of all influence factors of AF, the hazard ration in the population with SBP\u2265140 mm Hg was 1.74 times that of SBP<120 mm Hg. Conclusions The prevalence of AF in hypertensive population is significantly higher than in normotensive. SBP is an independent risk factor for the males with AF. The prevalence of AF is not related with diastolic blood pressure or PP.",

        "abstract": "Although higher resting heart rate (RHR) has emerged as a predictor for lifespan, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. The present study investigates whether a positive relationship exists between RHR and metabolic syndrome (MetS) and whether RHR predicts future MetS.A cohort of 89,860 participants were surveyed during 2006-2007 in Kailuan/Tangshan, China. MetS was diagnosed when a participant presented at least three of the following: abdominal adiposity, low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high triglycerides, hypertension or impaired fasting glucose. RHR was derived from ECG recordings and subjects were stratified based on RHR. Some participants without MetS at baseline were followed-up for 4\u2005years.At baseline, 23,150 participants (25.76%) had MetS. There was a positive association between RHR and MetS. The OR of having MetS was 1.49 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.69) in subjects with RHR at 95-104 compared with those at 55-64\u2005beats per minute (bpm) (reference), after adjusting for variables including age, sex, education, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activities, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, inflammatory biomarkers and renal function. More importantly, when 43,725 individuals from the original study without MetS at baseline were followed-up, higher RHR was found to predict greater risk of MetS incidence. The OR of developing MetS 4\u2005years later was 1.41 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.65) in subjects with RHR at 95-104\u2005bpm compared with reference, after all adjustments.Our cross-sectional and longitudinal findings provide evidence that RHR is an independent risk factor for existing MetS and a powerful predictor for future incidence of MetS.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the predictive value of baseline serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein for the first cardio-cerebral vascular event in the population with diabetes.In this prospective cohort study, a total of 101 510 employees of Kai Luan Group, who received healthy examination from July 2006 to October 2007, were screened and 7865 subjects with fasting plasma glucose \u2265 7.0 mmol/L or known diabetes mellitus and under insulin or hypoglycemic drugs therapy were followed up for 38 - 53 (48.02 \u00b1 3.14) months.(1) Incidence rates of total cardio-cerebral vascular events, cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction increased in proportion to increased levels of baseline hsCRP (P < 0.01). After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and cigarette smoking, multivariate Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis indicated that the individuals in the highest quartile of hsCRP levels group (hsCRP \u2265 2.50 mg/L) had an increased risk of total cardio-cerebral vascular events (RR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.20 - 2.24), cerebral infarction (RR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03 - 2.24), myocardial infarction (RR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.34 - 4.91) compared with those in the lowest quartile group (hsCRP < 0.41 mg/L). (2) Higher baseline hsCRP levels were associated with aging, female gender, higher BMI, SBP, DBP, fasting blood glucose, TC, TG, LDL-C levels and lower HDL-C levels (all P < 0.05).Baseline hsCRP level is associated with increased first cardio-cerebral vascular event in the population with diabetes.",

The present study was designed to examine temporal relationships among vascular stiffness, blood pressure progression, and hypertension. The Asymptomatic Polyvascular Abnormalities Community study is a community-based, prospective, long-term follow-up observational study. The present investigation is based on the baseline examinations (2010-2011) and the first follow-up measurements (2012-2013) included in the study. A total of 4025 participants were followed for an average of 27 months. Of 2153 participants free of hypertension at the baseline examination, 432 (20.07%) had incident hypertension. The authors observed that brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was an independent predictor of incident hypertension. baPWV during baseline examination was positively associated with higher systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure during the first follow-up examination. baPWV but not blood pressure during baseline examination was associated with baPWV during the first follow-up examination. This study not only provides evidence that baPWV is an independent predictor of blood pressure progression and incident hypertension, but also provides evidence that blood pressure is not associated with baPWV after adjusting for baseline baPWV.",

Methods The data used in this paper was derived from the KaiLuan study cohort. A total of 5321 isolated systolic hypertensives and 2226 normotensives(aged over 60 years old)were recruited,exclusion criteria included previous cardiovascular disease and unavailable information. Cardiovascular events including cerebral infarction,cerebral hemorrhage,acute myocardial infarction and definite fatal cardiovascular disease were recorded every 6 months during the follow-up[(49.5\u00b12.7)months]. Cox proportional hazard ratios were calculated to assess relative risk of incident cardiovascular events. Results \u2460Compared with the group of normotension,the average age of the group of isolated systolic hypertension and the level of triglyceride,total cholesterol,low density lipoproteincholesterol(LDL-C),fasting plasma glucose,uric acid and body mass index are higher(P<0.05). \u2461The median duration of follow-up was 49months(maximum,53 months),during which 383cardiovascular events were recorded.In the group of isolated systolic hypertension,the incidence rate of cardiovascular events,acute myocardial infarction,cerebral infarction,cerebral hemorrhage,and definite fatal cardiovascular disease of the older adult people was 5.84%,1.32%,2.89%,0.66% and 1.50% respectively. While in normotensives,the corresponding incidence rate was 3.23%,0.49%,1.66%,0.27%and 1.21%,among which the difference between the accumulated occurrence of cardiovascular events,acute myocardial infarction,cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage of the two groups were statistical significance(P<0.05).\u2462After adjustment for other traditional cardiovascular risk factors,in the group of isolated systolic hypertension,the relative risk of the total cardiovascular events,acute myocardialinfarction and cerebral infarction are 1.69times(95% CI1.21-2.35),2.30times(95%CI1.02-5.23)and 1.64 times(95% CI1.03-2.61)of those in the group of normotension respectively. Conclusion In the older adult people,the total cardiovascular events of the group of isolated systolic hypertension and the relative risk of acute myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction are higher than those of the group of normotension;the isolated systolic hypertension is the independently risk factor of the total cardiovascular events,acute myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction.",

Incidence of cardio-cerebral vascular events (myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage) was obtained during follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models was used to assess the relative risk of cardio-cerebral vascular events.(1) The follow-up time was 2 to 34 (15.32 \u00b1 7.94) years. (2) The childbearing age, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure before delivery were significantly higher while gestational weeks and weight of newborn were significantly less in PIH group than in NPIH group (all P < 0.01). Levels of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, body mass index, triglyceride, total cholesterol and fasting blood glucose during healthy examination between July 2006 and October 2007 were significantly higher in PIH group than in NPIH group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). (3) There were 71 cardio-cerebral vascular events during the follow-up. In PIH group, the incidence rate of cardio-cerebral vascular events, myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction was 20.64%, 11.08% and 8.67%, respectively, while the corresponding incidence rate was 7.82%, 4.02% and 2.67% in NPIH group (all P < 0.01). After adjustment for other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the risk of total cardio-cerebral vascular events, myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction in PIH group was 2.99 fold (95%CI: 1.80 - 4.95), 3.91 fold (95%CI: 1.71 - 8.91) and 3.96 fold (95%CI: 1.95 - 8.05) higher than in NPIH group.PIH is an independent risk factor for cardio-cerebral vascular events.",

        "abstract": "We present an adaptive coupled level-set/volume-of-fluid (ACLSVOF) method for interfacial flow simulations on unstructured triangular grids. At each time step, we evolve both the level set function and the volume fraction. The level set function is evolved by solving the level set advection equation using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. The volume fraction advection is performed using a Lagrangian-Eulerian method. The interface is reconstructed based on both the level set and the volume fraction information. In particular, the interface normal vector is calculated from the level set function while the line constant is determined by enforcing mass conservation based on the volume fraction. Different from previous works, we have developed an analytic method for finding the line constant on triangular grids, which makes interface reconstruction efficient and conserves volume of fluid exactly. The level set function is finally reinitialized to the signed distance to the reconstructed interface. Since the level set function is continuous, the normal vector calculation is easy and accurate compared to a classic volume-of-fluid method, while tracking the volume fraction is essential for enforcing mass conservation. The method is also coupled to a finite element based Stokes flow solver. The code validation shows that our method is second order and mass is conserved very accurately. In addition, owing to the adaptive grid algorithm we can resolve complex interface changes and interfaces of high curvature efficiently and accurately.",

Phys., in press], we presented an adaptive remeshing algorithm that automatically adjusts the size of the elements of meshes of unstructured triangles (2D) and unstructured tetrahedra (3D) with time and position in the computational domain in order to efficiently resolve the relevant physical scales. Here, we illustrate the performance of an implementation of the algorithm in finite-element/level-set simulations of deformable droplet and fluid-fluid interface interactions, breakup and coalescence in multiphase flows. The wide range of length scales characterizing the dynamics are accurately resolved as demonstrated by comparison to experiments and to theoretical and sharp-interface (boundary-integral) numerical results. The computational cost is found to be competitive even with respect to boundary-integral methods. For the first time using an interface-capturing (level-set) method we successfully simulate the inertia driven impact and rebound of a liquid droplet from a liquid interface and find agreement with recent experimental results.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a novel two-dimensional interface-fitted adaptive mesh method to solve elliptic problems of jump conditions across the interface, and its application in free interface problems with surface tension. The interface-fitted mesh is achieved by two operations: (i) the projection of mesh nodes onto the interface and (ii) the insertion of mesh nodes right on the interface. The interface-fitting technique is combined with an existing adaptive mesh approach which uses addition/subtraction and displacement of mesh nodes. We develop a simple piecewise linear finite element method built on this interface-fitted mesh and prove its almost optimal convergence for elliptic problems with jump conditions across the interface. Applications to two free interface problems, a sheared drop in Stokes flow and the growth of a solid tumor, are presented. In these applications, the interface surface tension serves as the jump condition or the Dirichlet boundary condition of the pressure, and the pressure is solved with the interface-fitted finite element method developed in this work. In this study, a level-set function is used to capture the evolution of the interface and provide the interface location for the interface fitting.",

        "title": "Adaptive unstructured volume remeshing - I: The method",
        "abstract": "We present an adaptive remeshing algorithm for meshes of unstructured triangles in two dimensions and unstructured tetrahedra in three dimensions. The algorithm automatically adjusts the size of the elements with time and position in the computational domain in order to resolve the relevant scales in multiscale physical systems to a user-prescribed accuracy while minimizing computational cost. The optimal mesh that provides the desired resolution is achieved by minimizing a spring-like mesh energy function that depends on the local physical scales using local mesh restructuring operations that include edge-swapping, element insertion/removal, and dynamic mesh-node displacement (equilibration). The algorithm is a generalization to volume domains of the adaptive surface remeshing algorithm developed by Cristini et al. [V. Cristini, J. Blawzdziewicz, M. Loewenberg, An adaptive mesh algorithm for evolving surfaces: simulations of drop breakup and coalescence. J. Comp. Phys., 168 (2001) 445] in the context of deforming interfaces in two and three dimensions. The remeshing algorithm is versatile and can be applied to a number of physical and biological problems, where the local length scales are dictated by the specific problem. In Part II [X. Zheng, J. Lowengrub, A. Anderson, V. Cristini, Adaptive unstructured volume remeshing - II: application to two- and three-dimensional level-set simulations of multiphase flow, J. Comp. Phys., in press], we illustrate the performance of an implementation of the algorithm in finite-element/level-set simulations of deformable droplet and fluid-fluid interface interactions, breakup and coalescence in multiphase flows.",

        "abstract": "The intracellular and extracellular dynamics that govern tumor growth and invasiveness in vivo remain poorly understood. Cell genotype and phenotype, and nutrient, oxygen, and growth factor concentrations are key variables. In previous work, using a reaction-diffusion mathematical model based on variables that directly describe tumor cell cycle and biology, we formulated the hypothesis that tumor morphology is determined by the competition between heterogeneous cell proliferation caused by spatial diffusion gradients, e.g., of cell nutrients, driving shape instability and invasive tumor morphologies, and stabilizing mechanical forces, e.g., cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion. To test this hypothesis, we here obtain variable-based statistics for input to the mathematical model from in vitro human and rat glioblastoma cultures. A linear stability analysis of the model predicts that glioma spheroid morphology is margin- ally stable. In agreement with this prediction, for a range of variable values, unbounded growth of the tumor mass and invasion of the environment are observed in vitro. The mechanism of invasion is recursive subspheroid component development at the tumor viable rim and separation from the parent spheroid. Results of computer simulations of the mathematical model closely resemble the morphologies and spatial arrangement of tumor cells from the in vitro model. We propose that tumor morphogenesis in vivo may be a function of marginally stable environmental conditions caused by spatial variations in cell nutrients, oxygen, and growth factors, and that controlling these conditions by decreasing spatial gradients could benefit treatment outcomes, whereas current treatment, and especially antiangiogenic therapy, may trigger spatial heterogeneity (e.g., local hypoxia), thus causing invasive instability.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the pharmacokinetics and effect of doxorubicin and cisplatin in vascularized tumors through\n two-dimensional simulations. We take into account especially vascular and morphological heterogeneity as well as cellular\n and lesion-level pharmacokinetic determinants like P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux and cell density. To do this we construct a\n multi-compartment PKPD model calibrated from published experimental data and simulate 2-h bolus administrations followed by\n 18-h drug washout. Our results show that lesion-scale drug and nutrient distribution may significantly impact therapeutic\n efficacy and should be considered as carefully as genetic determinants modulating, for example, the production of multidrug-resistance\n protein or topoisomerase II. We visualize and rigorously quantify distributions of nutrient, drug, and resulting cell inhibition.\n A main result is the existence of significant heterogeneity in all three, yielding poor inhibition in a large fraction of\n the lesion, and commensurately increased serum drug concentration necessary for an average 50% inhibition throughout the lesion\n (the IC50 concentration). For doxorubicin the effect of hypoxia and hypoglycemia (\u201cnutrient effect\u201d) is isolated and shown to further\n increase cell inhibition heterogeneity and double the IC50, both undesirable. We also show how the therapeutic effectiveness of doxorubicin penetration therapy depends upon other determinants\n affecting drug distribution, such as cellular efflux and density, offering some insight into the conditions under which otherwise\n promising therapies may fail and, more importantly, when they will succeed. Cisplatin is used as a contrast to doxorubicin\n since both published experimental data and our simulations indicate its lesion distribution is more uniform than that of doxorubicin.\n Because of this some of the complexity in predicting its therapeutic efficacy is mitigated. Using this advantage, we show\n results suggesting that in vitro monolayer assays using this drug may more accurately predict in vivo performance than for\n drugs like doxorubicin. The nonlinear interaction among various determinants representing cell and lesion phenotype as well\n as therapeutic strategies is a unifying theme of our results. Throughout it can be appreciated that macroscopic environmental\n conditions, notably drug and nutrient distributions, give rise to considerable variation in lesion response, hence clinical\n resistance. Moreover, the synergy or antagonism of combined therapeutic strategies depends heavily upon this environment.",

        "abstract": "Empirical evidence and theoretical studies suggest that the phenotype, i.e., cellular- and molecular-scale dynamics, including proliferation rate and adhesiveness due to microenvironmental factors and gene expression that govern tumor growth and invasiveness, also determine gross tumor-scale morphology. It has been difficult to quantify the relative effect of these links on disease progression and prognosis using conventional clinical and experimental methods and observables. As a result, successful individualized treatment of highly malignant and invasive cancers, such as glioblastoma, via surgical resection and chemotherapy cannot be offered and outcomes are generally poor. What is needed is a deterministic, quantifiable method to enable understanding of the connections between phenotype and tumor morphology. Here, we critically assess advantages and disadvantages of recent computational modeling efforts (e.g., continuum, discrete, and cellular automata models) that have pursued this understanding. Based on this assessment, we review a multiscale, i.e., from the molecular to the gross tumor scale, mathematical and computational \"first-principle\" approach based on mass conservation and other physical laws, such as employed in reaction-diffusion systems. Model variables describe known characteristics of tumor behavior, and parameters and functional relationships across scales are informed from in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo biology. We review the feasibility of this methodology that, once coupled to tumor imaging and tumor biopsy or cell culture data, should enable prediction of tumor growth and therapy outcome through quantification of the relation between the underlying dynamics and morphological characteristics. In particular, morphologic stability analysis of this mathematical model reveals that tumor cell patterning at the tumor-host interface is regulated by cell proliferation, adhesion and other phenotypic characteristics: histopathology information of tumor boundary can be inputted to the mathematical model and used as a phenotype-diagnostic tool to predict collective and individual tumor cell invasion of surrounding tissue. This approach further provides a means to deterministically test effects of novel and hypothetical therapy strategies on tumor behavior.",

Neural networks are among the most important machine learning techniques and thus good candi- dates for a project in artificial intelligence. In this project, the students need to understand and extend an existing implementation of the back-propagation algorithm and apply it to recognizing static hand gestures in images. This project requires students to develop a deep understanding of neural networks and the back-propagation algorithm. It extends a project from Tom Mitchell's \"Machine Learning\" book and builds on ideas, text and code from that project (courtesy of Tom Mitchell). The project is versatile since it allows for theoretical questions and implementations. We list a variety of possible project choices, including easy and difficult questions.",

We define a new type of contract, called K-swaps, that describes multiple task exchanges among multiple agents at a time, which generalizes the concept of single task exchanges. We design a distributed algorithm that constructs all possible K-swaps that reduce the team cost of a given task allocation and show that each agent typically only needs to communicate a small part of its local computation results to the other agents. We then demonstrate empirically that K-swaps can reduce the team costs of several existing task-allocation algorithms significantly even if K is small.",

An example is multi-agent routing problems where several agents need to visit targets simultaneously, for example, to move obstacles out of the way cooperatively. First, we propose reaction functions as a novel way of characterizing the costs of agents in a distributed way. Second, we show how to approximate reaction functions so that their computation and communication times are polynomial. Third, we show how reaction functions can be used by a central planner to allocate tasks to agents. Finally, we show experimentally that the resulting task allocations are better than those of other greedy methods that do not use reaction functions.",

We exploit the insight that the resulting travel distances are small if the bidding and winner-determination rules are designed to result in hillclimbing, namely to assign an additional target to a robot in each round of the sequential single-item auction so that the team cost increases the least. We study the impact of increasing the lookahead of hillclimbing and using roll-outs to improve the evaluation of partial target assignments. We describe the bidding and winner-determination rules of the resulting sequential single-item auctions and evaluate them experimentally, with surprising results: larger lookaheads do not improve sequential single-item auctions reliably while only a small number of roll-outs in early rounds already improve them substantially",

To reduce the team cost of sequential single-item auction algorithms, we generalize them to assign more than one additional task during each round, which increases their similarity to combinatorial auction algorithms. We show that, for a given number of additional tasks to be assigned during each round, every agent needs to submit only a constant number of bids per round and the runtime of winner determination is linear in the number of agents. The communication and winner determination costs do not depend on the number of tasks and thus scale to a large number of tasks for small bundle sizes.

We study how to improve the team performance of sequential single-item auctions while still controlling the agents in real time. Our idea is to assign that task to agents during the current round whose regret is large, where the regret of a task is defined as the difference of the second-smallest and smallest team costs resulting from assigning the task to the second-best and best agent, respectively. Our experimental results show that sequential single-item auctions with regret clearing indeed result in smaller team costs than standard sequential single-item auctions for three out of four combinations of two different team objectives and two different capacity constraints (including no capacity constraints).",

        "abstract": "We study distributed task-allocation problems where cooperative agents need to perform some tasks simultaneously. Examples are multi-agent routing problems where several agents need to visit some targets simultaneously, for example, to move obstacles out of the way cooperatively. In this paper, we first generalize the concept of reaction functions proposed in the literature to characterize the agent costs of performing multiple complex tasks. Second, we show how agents can construct and approximate reaction functions in a distributed way. Third, we show how reaction functions can be used by an auctionlike algorithm to allocate tasks to agents. Finally, we show empirically that the team costs of our algorithms are substantially smaller than those of an existing state-of-the-art allocation algorithm for complex tasks.",

The data of 572 were analyzed with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and other 573 data were done with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results showed that the competency model of Chinese relationship managers of commercial banks contained 3 domains and 11factors. The firs domain was customer service that was composed of customer need analysis, build and maintain the relationship between banks with customers, select customers, show products or services. The second domain was social competency that was composed of influence, cooperation, interpersonal communication. The third domain was individual cognition and characteristics that contained information seeking, learning, emotional moderation and conscientiousness. The results of hierarchical regression analysis showed that conscientiousness and cooperation positively related to job satisfaction and emotional commitment; conscientiousness negatively related to turnover intention, but information seeking positively related to turnover intention.",

        "title": "The Impact of Employee Career Adaptability: Multilevel Analysis",
        "abstract": "With high speed of mobility and end of life-long employment of Chinese employees, it is critical to investigate the impact of employee\u2019s career adaptability on organizational success. However, the relationship between career adaptability and organizational success is mixed due to the so-called management dilemma of career adaptability (when the employee\u2019s career adaptability is high, his job performance and turnover intention are also high.). Moreover, the role of career adaptability as the core of self-career management capacity among the relationships between organizational career management and individual turnover intention/job performance have not been known. So, in this study, we investigated the relationships between employee\u2019s career adaptability and their turnover intention, and job performance, and the moderating role of tenure over these relationships. And based on the multilevel theory, we propose that career adaptability is a mediator between organizational career management and individual turnover intention/job performance. We collected data from 485 employees in 54 Chinese enterprises. Employees completed the careeradaptability questionnaire at the first time wave, and completed the turnover intention questionnaire two weeks later, while one direct supervisor of each employee was also invited to complete the job performance questionnaire and organizational career management questionnaire. For data analyses, we used SEM (structural equation model), HRA (hierarchical regression analysis) and HLM (hierarchical linear model). The results of SEM showed that career adaptability was negatively correlated to turnover intention, and positively associated with supervisor-rated performance. The results of HRA showed that tenure moderated the relationships between career adaptability and turnover intention/supervisor-rated job performance. This means that the correlation between career adaptability and turnover intention was significantly negative for employees with short-tenure, but not for employees with long-tenure. The correlation between career adaptability and supervisor-rated job performance was significantly positive for employees with short-tenure, but not for employees with long-tenure. So the findings were different from the current literature. The HLM results indicated that career adaptability fully mediated the relation between organizational career management and supervisor-rated job performance, but had no mediating effect on the relation between organizational career management and turnover intention. Therefore, individual career adaptability is the key mediating variable between organizational career management and self-career management. According to the career construction theory, the complex relationships between employee\u2019s career adaptability and organizational success (for example turnover, job performance) and individual career success (for example subjective and objective success) should be tested in the future. More moderators of the relationships between career adaptability and organizational success / individual career success should be explored. Meanwhile the mediating role of career adaptability among the relationships between organizational career management/self-career management and individual career success /organizational performance could be further explored, so that organizations could establish the career adaptability-based human resource development system by integrating organizational career management and self-career management.",

        "abstract": "For Chinese enterprises,the organizational learning capacity is the most important core competitive in the future.But Chinese leaders don't know how to lead organizational learning.To date,there was limited systematic empirical research directly linking leadership and organizational learning.Recent theoretical work systematically linked transformational and transactional leadership with organizational learning.Only few empirical study explored the relationship between transformational leadership and organizational learning,and the results showed that transformational leadership could improve organizational leaning.The paternalistic leadership is based on the Chinese culture.However,there was no research to explore the effectiveness mechanism of the paternalistic leadership on organizational learning in the context of Chinese culture.And the management practice in China need to know what and how leadership could improve organizational leaning in order to improve their organizational core competitiveness One survey that contained organizational learning scale,paternalistic leadership scale,and human resource management practice scale was employed as the tool in the study.Among the major measures,the 33-item 3of paternalistic leadership scale was adopted from Zheng et al(2011);29-item organizational learning scale was measured by using the questionnaire of Yu Haibo et al(1991);19-item human resource management practice scale was developed by L\u00f3pez et al(1994)and Wright et al(2005).The reliability of Cronbach's alpha for these measures were all above 0.70.Four hundred and sixty one employees of thirteen enterprises from several cities in China answered the questionnaires.Exploratory factor analysis(EFA),confirmatory factor analysis(CFA) and structure equation model(SEM) were applied to the analysis of the data. The results of EFA showed that Human Resource Management Practice Questionnaire was composed of five factors: selection and employment,strategic training,compensation management,performance management,employee participation.And the results of CFA confirmed the five factors model.The results of SEM(structure equation model) showed that strategic training,compensation management,and employee participation were the total mediating variables between benevolence leadership and organizational learning.Strategic training and compensation management were the partial mediating variables between moral leadership and organizational learning.At last,Strategic training and compensation management were the total mediating variables between authoritarianism leadership and organizational learning.The results also showed that the effectiveness of moral leadership on organizational learning was the biggest one,the benevolence leadership was the second one,and the authoritarianism leadership was the smallest one. The main implication of the results was that paternalistic leadership could influence organizational learning through the mediating of human resource management,and also could directly influence organizational learning.The empirical study could enrich the theory of the leadership of organizational learning,especially the value of the paternalistic leadership in Chinese culture.And at the same time,the results suggested that the leaders,especial the Chinese paternalistic leaders,could improve the level of organizational learning through constructing and improving the organizational human resource management system.This suggests that human resource management system has great positive effectiveness on organizational long-term development in Chinese enterprises. In the future,research need to test the causal and mediating relationships longitudinally or by qualitative research.The complex relationships between paternalistic leadership and organizational learning could be constructed and tested according to the organizational culture and strategic human resources management theory.And the moderators in the relationships between paternalistic leadership and organizational learning should be explored deeply.At last,the complex mediating role of human resources management and organizational culture.so that paternalistic leaders could integrate organizational soft and hard to improve organizational capability.",

But the effects of organizational trust on individual employees and organization are unclear, especially in Chinese companies. This study would fill the gap. Eight hundred and one employees from 43 companies of 9 different cities across China answered our questionnaire. The results of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed that the questionnaire from Cummings and Bromiley (1996) had sufficient reliability and validity. At the individual level, the results of Hierarchical Linear Analysis showed that organizational trust was significantly positively related to job satisfaction and emotional commitment, and negatively related to turnover intention. The results also showed that organizational trust moderated the relationship between job satisfaction/emotional commitment and turnover intention. Specifically, when organizational trust is high, the relationship between job satisfaction/emotional commitment and turnover intention is stronger compare to when organizational trust is low. At the organizational level, the results of Structure Equation Model showed that organizational trust was positively associated with perceptual organizational financial performance and the relationship was fully mediated by organizational innovation and organizational learning. The main implication of the results was that we should pay more attentions to the level of organizational trust in human resources management. In the future, the complex influence mechanisms of organizational trust on individuals, teams/groups and organizations should be explored deeply and synthetically.",

        "abstract": "Floral organs in rice (Oryza sativa) can be purple, brown or red in color due to the accumulation of flavonoids. But the molecular mechanism underlying specific organ pigmentation is not clear. Here, we propose a C-S-A gene model for rice hull pigmentation and characterize through genetic, molecular and metabolomic approaches. Further we conduct phylogenetic studies to reveal the evolution of rice color. In this gene system, C1 encodes a R2R3-MYB transcription factor and acts as a color-producing gene and S1 encodes a bHLH protein that functions in a tissue-specific manner. C1 interacts with S1 and activate expression of A1 which encoding a dihydro-flavonol reductase (DFR). As a consequence, the hull is purple whereby functional A1 participation leads to high accumulation of cyanidin 3-O-glucoside. Loss of function of A1 leads to brown hull color due to accumulation of flavonoids such as hesperetin 5-O-glucoside, rutin and delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside. It shows different evolutionary pathway of rice color in japonica and indica, supporting independent origin of cultivars in each subspecies. Our findings give complete perspectives on gene regulation network of rice color formation and supply theoretical basis for extended application of this beneficial trait.",

        "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes display differential expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Hundreds of imprinted genes have been identified from several plant species. Here we identified, with a high level of confidence, 208 imprinted gene candidates from rice (Oryza sativa). Imprinted genes of rice showed limited association to the transposable elements, which contrasts with findings from Arabidopsis thaliana. Generally, imprinting in rice is conserved within a species, but intraspecific variation was also detected. The imprinted rice genes do not show signatures of selection, which suggests that domestication has had a limited evolutionary consequence on genomic imprinting. Though conservation of imprinting in plants is limited, we show that some loci are imprinted in several different species. Moreover, our results suggest that different types of epigenetic regulation can be established either before or after fertilization. Imprinted 24-nt small RNAs and their neighboring genes tend to express alleles from different parents. This association was not observed between 21-nt small RNAs and their neighboring genes. Together, our findings suggest that regulation of imprinting can be diverse, and genomic imprinting has evolutionary and biological significance.",

The identification of beneficial genes from wild rice that have been lost or weakened in cultivated rice has become increasingly important for modern breeding strategies. In this study, we constructed a set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) of wild rice,  with the  cultivar 9311 genetic background. Four grain-related traits, i.e., grain length (GL), grain width (GW), length-width ratio (LWR), and thousand grain weight (TGW), were screened across six environments. A total of 37 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified in these environments and mapped to 12 chromosomes. Sixteen QTLs were detected in at least two environments, and two QTL clusters were observed on Chr. 4 and Chr. 8. Based on a comparative analysis with QTLs identified in previous studies, the CSSLs between  accessions and 9311 had high genetic diversity. Among the sixteen stable QTLs, seven for TGW, LWR, GL, and GW were not previously identified, indicating potentially novel alleles from wild rice. These CSSLs provide powerful tools for functional studies and the cloning of essential genes in rice; furthermore, we identified elite germplasm for rice variety improvement.",

        "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes display monoallelic expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Hundreds of imprinted genes have been identified from several plant species. Here we identified, with a high level of confidence, 208 imprinted candidates from rice. Imprinted genes of rice showed limited association to the transposable elements, which is contrast to the findings in Arabidopsis. Generally, imprinting of rice is conserved within species, but intraspecific variations were confirmed here. Imprinting between cultivated rice and wild rice are likely similar. The imprinted genes of rice do not show significant selective signatures overall, which suggests that domestication imposes limited evolutionary effects on genomic imprinting of rice. Though the conservation of imprinting in plants is limited, here we prove that some loci tend to be imprinted in different species. In addition, our results suggest that differential epigenetic regulation between parental alleles can be established either prior to or post-fertilization. The imprinted 24-nt small RNAs, but not the 21-nt ones, likely involve the regulation of imprinting in an opposite parental-allele targeting manner. Together, our findings suggest that regulation of imprinting can be very diverse, and genomic imprinting as well as imprinted genes have essential evolutionary and biological significance.",

        "abstract": "We investigated how oxygen availability, substrate amount, and quality affect the temperature dependency of enzymatic processes involved in the production of carbon dioxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (NO). Three substrates differing in microbial degradability (glucose with potassium nitrate, glycine, and phenylalanine) were added to a mountain grassland soil at a range of concentrations. Soils were incubated at 21 and 1\u00a0% of O content and at 10 and 20\u00a0\u00b0C. Oxygen availability was a main factor controlling the reaction rates and temperature sensitivity of CO and NO production. The temperature sensitivity of CO production was higher under aerobic versus oxygen-limited conditions, and the opposite dependency was observed for the NO production. Substrate availability was a second factor affecting the temperature sensitivity of the processes leading to the production of these gases. The temperature response was reduced under substrate limitation. Apparent activation energy for aerobic CO production was similar ( \u2009~\u200930\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol) for tested substrates, while   for anaerobic NO production increased in the order phenylalanine\u2009<\u2009glycine\u2009<\u2009glucose\u2009+\u2009NO  having values 45, 75, and 106\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol, respectively. Commonly, the temperature sensitivity of NO production (2\u2009<\u2009 \u2009<\u20094.5) was much higher than that for CO ( \u2009\u2264\u20091.5).",

        "abstract": "Flowering time, or heading date, is a critical agronomic trait that determines the cropping season and regional adaptability, and ultimately grain yield in rice. A number of genes involved in photoperiodic flowering have been cloned and their roles in modulating expression of the flowering genes have been characterized to a certain extent. However, much less is known about the pathway in transmitting the day length response signal(s) to induce transition to reproductive growth. Here, we report a constitutive flowering repressor OsCOL10, which encodes a member of the CONSTANS-like (COL) family. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCOL10 (driven by a strong promoter or by fusing it to the activation domain of VP64) showed delayed flowering time under both short and long days.OsCOL10 is affected by the circadian clock and is preferentially expressed in leaf mesophyll cells; it is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity. Further studies show that OsCOL10 represses the expression of theFT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1. Transcripts of OsCOL10 are more abundant in plants carrying a functional Ghd7 allele or overexpressing Ghd7 than in Ghd7-deficient plants, thus placing OsCOL10 downstream of Ghd7.Taking these findings together, we conclude that OsCOL10 functions as a flowering time repressor that links Ghd7 and Ehd1 in rice.",

        "abstract": "A wild rice QTL qGL12.2 for grain length was fine mapped to an 82-kb interval in chromosome 12 containing six candidate genes and none was reported previously. Grain length is an important trait for yield and commercial value in rice. Wild rice seeds have a very slender shape and have many desirable genes that have been lost in cultivated rice during domestication. In this study, we identified a quantitative trait locus, qGL12.2, which controls grain length in wild rice. First, a wild rice chromosome segment substitution line, CSSL41, was selected that has longer glume and grains than does the Oryza sativa indica cultivar, 9311. Next, an F population was constructed from a cross between CSSL41 and 9311. Using the next-generation sequencing combined with bulked-segregant analysis and F recombinants analysis, qGL12.2 was finally fine mapped to an 82-kb interval in chromosome 12. Six candidate genes were found, and no reported grain length genes were found in this interval. Using scanning electron microscopy, we found that CSSL41 cells are significantly longer than those of 9311, but there is no difference in cell widths. These data suggest that qGL12.2 is a novel gene that controls grain cell length in wild rice. Our study provides a new genetic resource for rice breeding and a starting point for functional characterization of the wild rice GL gene.",

However, this unpleasant influence could be reduced effectively by adopting UVO treatment.

        "abstract": "The modification of graphene\u2019s properties is essential for its applications. During the device preparation and morphology characterization, graphene is usually irradiated by electron beam. The process may induce defects such as damage and doping in graphene. Moreover, when the irradiated graphene is exposed in air, the defects will adsorb impurities, such as gas atoms, atomic groups, or molecules, leading to changes of the properties of graphene. Therefore, it is important to study the evolution of the properties of the irradiated graphene exposed in air. In this paper, the time evolution of the Raman spectra of graphene after irradiated by electron beam was measured. It is found that D peak appears after irradiation, indicating the formation of defects. The Raman spectra at different time after irradiation show redshifts and blueshifts of the peaks, because the carriers was p-type at first and then became n-type finally. It signifies that air exposure has changed the conducting properties of the irradiated graphene. The results suggest that air exposure has significant effect on defect engineering of graphene.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum dioxides (MoO2) have potential applications in batteries owing to their good electrical conductivity. Here, we report the electrical properties of high-quality MoO2 nanorods grown using chemical vapor deposition which are partially wrapped in MoS2 on c-sapphire [\u03b1-Al2O3(0001)] substrates and subsequently transferred onto Si wafers for device fabrication. The as-fabricated devices with the individual MoO2 nanorods showed a high electrical conductivity of 6.04\u2009\u00d7\u2009103\u2009S/cm and a low contact resistance of 33\u2009\u03a9, thus demonstrating a superior electrical performance than in any other previous reports on MoO2-based devices. The MoS2 wrapping around the rods had a negligible effect on the conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the MoO2 nanorods was observed to decline in air when a high voltage was applied; this could be mitigated by packaging the nanorods using SiO2 or holding them under high vacuum. Our results provide the foundation for understanding the properties and potential applications of ...",

        "abstract": "Most two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit more than one structural phase, leading to a number of remarkable physics and potential device applications beyond graphene. Here, we demonstrated a feasible route to trigger 2H-to-1T' phase transition in few-layer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) by laser irradiation. The effects of laser power and irradiation duration were systematically studied in this study, revealing the accumulated heating effect as the main driving force for such a phase transition. By carefully adjusting laser power and irradiation time, we could control the structural phases of MoTe2 as 2H, 2H + 1T', and 1T'. After thermal annealing at a rather low temperature, the laser-irradiated MoTe2 showed a completely suppressed 2H component and a more stabilized 1T' phase, demonstrating that the microscopic origin of the irreversible 2H-to-1T' phase transition is the formation of Te vacancies in MoTe2 due to laser local instantaneous heating. Our findings together with the unique properties of MoTe2 pave the way for high-performance nanoelectronics and optoelectronics based on 2D TMDs and their heterostructures.",

Here, carrier modulation of ambipolar few-layer MoTe2 transistors is demonstrated utilizing magnesium oxide (MgO) surface charge transfer doping. By carefully adjusting the thickness of MgO film and the number of MoTe2 layers, the carrier polarity of MoTe2 transistors from p-type to n-type can be reversely controlled. The electron mobility of MoTe2 is significantly enhanced from 0.1 to 20 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 after 37 nm MgO film doping, indicating a greatly improved electron transport. The effective carrier modulation enables to achieve high-performance complementary inverters with high DC gain of u003e25 and photodetectors based on few-layer MoTe2 flakes. The results present an important advance toward the realization of electronic and optoelectronic devices based on 2D transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors.",

Here, we report an effective method to tune intrinsic n-type few-layer MoSe2 to p-type through controlling precisely the ultraviolet-ozone treatment time, which can be attributed to the surface charge transfer from the underlying MoSe2 to MoOx (x < 3). The resulting hole mobility and concentration are \u223c20.1 cm2 V-1 s-1 and \u223c1.9 \u00d7 1012 cm-2, respectively, and the on-off ratio is \u223c105, which are comparable to the values of pristine n-type MoSe2. Moreover, the lateral p-n homojunction prepared by partially treating MoSe2 displays a high rectification ratio of 2.4 \u00d7 104, an ideality factor of 1.1, and a high photoresponsivity of 0.23 A W-1 to the 633 nm laser at Vd = 0 V and Vg = 0 V due to the built-in potential in the p-n homojunction area.

        "abstract": "Atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterostructures have attracted increasing attention due to their unprecedented opportunities in the fields of electronics and optoelectronics. However, selective growth of either lateral or vertical TMDC heterostructure remains challenging. Here, we report that lateral and vertical MoS2/MoSe2 epitaxial heterostructures can be successfully fabricated via one-step growth strategy, which are triggered by the concentration of sulfur precursor vapor and high temperature annealing process. Vertically stacked MoS2/MoSe2 heterostructures can be synthesized via control of the nucleation and growth kinetics, which is induced by high sulfur vapor concentration. High temperature annealing process results in the formation of fractured MoSe2 and in situ epitaxial growth of lateral MoSe2-MoS2 heterostructures. This study has unveiled the importance of sulfur vapor concentration and high temperature annealing process on the controllable growth of MoSe2-MoS2 heterostructures, which paves a new route for fabricating two-dimensional TMDC heterostructures.",

Here, we report a layer-by-layer oxidation of atomically thin MoTe2 flakes via ozone (O3) exposure. The thickness of MoOx oxide film could be tuning with atomic-level accuracy simply by varying O3 exposure time. Additionally, MoOx-covered MoTe2 shows a hole-dominated transport behavior. Our findings point to a simple and effective strategy for growing homogenous surface oxide film on MoTe2, which is promising for several purposes in metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor, ranging from surface passivation to dielectric layers.",

Studies show that the optical contrast of monolayer graphene on an Al\u2082O\u2083/Si substrate is superior to that on a traditional 300 nm SiO\u2082/Si substrate (2.4 times). Significantly, the transconductance of monolayer graphene transistors on the Al\u2082O\u2083/Si substrate shows an approximately 10-fold increase, due to a smaller dielectric thickness and a higher dielectric constant. Furthermore, this substrate is also suitable for other 2D materials, such as WS\u2082, and can enhance the transconductance remarkably by 61.3 times. These results demonstrate a new and ideal substrate for the fabrication of 2D materials-based electronic logic devices.",

Through photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy, we find that, compared to that of the bottom layer, the top layer of BSS demonstrates PL redshift, Raman E 2 g 1 mode redshift, and lower PL intensity. Spatial inhomogeneity of PL and Raman are also observed in the BSS. Based on theoretical analysis, these exotic effects can be attributed to substrate-coupling-induced strain and doping. Our findings provide pertinent insight into film-substrate interaction, and are of great significance to researches on bilayer-stacked structures including twisted bilayer structure, Van der Waals hetero- and homo-structure.",

        "abstract": "Many organizations use formal recognition programs (e.g., \"employee of the month\") as a way to publically acknowledge an individual employee's outstanding performance and motivate continued high performance. However, it remains unclear whether emphasizing individual achievement in a team context is beneficial or detrimental for recipients' teammates and, by extension, the team as a whole. Drawing on a social influence perspective, we examine potential spillover effects of individual formal recognition programs in teams. We hypothesize that a single team member's recognition will produce positive spillover effects on other team members' performance, as well as overall team performance, via social influence processes, especially when the award recipient is located in a central position in a team. Findings from 2 lab experiments of 24 teams and 40 teams (Study 1 and Study 2, respectively) and a field experiment of 52 manufacturing teams (Study 3) reveal that formally recognizing a team member leads to positive changes in her/his teammates' individual and collective performance. Thus, formal social recognition programs can potentially provide a motivational effect beyond individual recipients. (PsycINFO Database Record ",

In Study 2, a multiwave survey study of 589 airline pilots, we found that safety behavior mediated the adverse relationship between abusive supervision and downstream objective safety performance. Higher trait social standing uncertainty was associated with a stronger adverse relationship between abusive supervision and safety. Indirect relationships of abusive supervision with safety behavior (Study 1) and safety performance (Study 2) were stronger among individuals with higher social standing uncertainty.

        "abstract": "Abstract. Workplace ostracism, conceived as to being ignored or excluded by others, has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years. One essential topic in this area is how to reduce or even eliminate the negative consequences of workplace ostracism. Based on conservation of resources (COR) theory, the current study assesses the relationship between workplace ostracism and its negative outcomes, as well as the moderating role played by psychological capital, using data collected from 256 employees in three companies in the northern part of China. The study yields two important findings: (1) workplace ostracism is positively related to intention to leave and (2) psychological capital moderates the effect of workplace ostracism on affective commitment and intention to leave. This paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for organizations and employees, along with recommendations for future research.",

        "abstract": "The stock market in China has experienced significant turbulence since July 2014, including a bull market. In this paper, we propose that exposure to stock (defined as the condition of being exposed to both stock and stock-related information) can induce anxiety disorder when the market is in a turbulent period. To examine this prediction, we designed two studies in which we operationalized exposure to stock in two different ways. In Study 1, a panel analysis of a longitudinal data set for the Chinese stock market from January 2014 to July 2015 demonstrated that exposure to stock had a significant positive impact on individuals' anxiety disorder, even in a bull market. Study 2, employing priming experiments, further supported that a temporarily primed \"stock mindset\" subconsciously increased participants' anxiety. In addition, Study 2 revealed that physical exercise helped attenuate the detrimental impact of exposure to stock on mental well-being. This research demonstrates the detrimental impact of exposure to a turbulent stock market - even a rising market - on individuals' mental health. Furthermore, it identifies an effective way to buffer such impact, and suggests ways for social scientists to employ search engines and the related data sets to obtain psychological or behavioral information (especially emotions and emotion disorders) by examining longitudinal \"Big Data.\"",

        "abstract": "Past research on the effects of work engagement on the family has demonstrated contrasting effects, with some suggesting that work engagement is beneficial for family life whereas others suggesting that it may be detrimental. In this research, using a sample of 125 employees who responded to daily surveys both at work and at home for 2 consecutive weeks, the authors present a multilevel examination of the relationships of work engagement to family outcomes aimed at elucidating such work-family effects. Their findings revealed that employees' daily work engagement experiences related positively, within individuals, to work-family interpersonal capitalization, which in turn, related positively to daily family satisfaction and to daily work-family balance. The findings also indicate that both the relationship between daily work engagement and work-family interpersonal capitalization and the indirect effects of daily work engagement on the family outcomes were stronger for employees with higher intrinsic motivation than for those with lower intrinsic motivation. The authors discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings and offer directions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Using a twice-daily diary design over the course of a 3-week period, results from multilevel regression analysis revealed that distinct patterns of change in positive and negative affect optimally predicted contextual and task performance among a sample of 71 employees at a medium-sized technology company. Specifically, within persons, increases (upshifts) in positive affect over the course of a workday better predicted the subsequent day's organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) when such increases were coupled with decreases (downshifts) in negative affect. The optimal pattern of change in positive and negative affect differed, however, in predicting task performance. That is, upshifts in positive affect over the course of the workday better predicted the subsequent day's task performance when such upshifts were accompanied by upshifts in negative affect. The contribution of our findings to PSI theory and the broader affective and motivation regulation literatures, along with practical implications, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record ",

We developed three propositions. First, based on the group engagement model, we hypothesized that procedural justice enhances employee engagement through employee organizational identification. Second, employees with stronger moral identity centrality are more likely to be engaged in their jobs. Third, procedural justice compensates for the effect of moral identity centrality on employee engagement. Specifically, when procedural justice is higher, employee moral identity centrality plays a less significant role in employee engagement; whilst when procedural justice is lower, the effect of moral identity centrality on employee engagement is stronger. Research findings based on an employee survey in a leading financial service organization provide support for the above propositions.",

Specifically, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, we find that EWB comprises three dimensions: life well-being, workplace well-being, and psychological well-being. We establish the reliability and validity of the newly developed EWB scale through a series of quantitative studies, which indicate that EWB is significantly correlated with affective organizational commitment and job performance based on the data collected from multiple sources at two points in time. We find that EWB has measurement invariance (configural invariance) across Chinese and American contexts. We also discuss the theoretical contributions of these findings to cross-cultural organizational behavior studies, along with the practical implications of our results.

        "abstract": "Although much research has been done on employee collective identification with the organization and the work unit, the role of followers' personal identification with the leader in followers' work outcomes has not been fully examined. Drawing on research on transformational leadership and social identity theory, the authors examined a partial nomological network of personal identification with the leader and its mediating effects. Results show that transformational leadership was positively related to personal identification with the leader, which was significantly associated with followers' innovativeness, affective organizational commitment, and turnover intention. In addition, personal identification with the leader significantly mediated the relationships of transformational leadership with followers' affective organizational commitment and turnover intention. Although personal identification with the leader did not significantly mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and followers' work outcomes, transformational leaders might indirectly increase followers' innovativeness through gaining followers' personal identification. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2012.",

        "abstract": " In cross-sectional studies and short-term clinical trials, it has been suggested that there is a positive dose-response relation between alcohol consumption and HDL concentrations. However, prospective data have been limited. We sought to determine the association between total alcohol intake, the type of alcohol-containing beverage, and the 6-y (2006-2012) longitudinal change in HDL-cholesterol concentrations in a community-based cohort. A total of 71,379 Chinese adults (mean age: 50 y) who were free of cardiovascular diseases and cancer and did not use cholesterol-lowering agents during follow-up were included in the study. Alcohol intake was assessed via a questionnaire in 2006 (baseline), and participants were classified into the following categories of alcohol consumption: never, past, light (women: 0-0.4 servings/d; men: 0-0.9 servings/d), moderate (women: 0.5-1.0 servings/d; men: 1-2 servings/d), and heavy (women: >1.0 servings/d; men: >2 servings/d). HDL-cholesterol concentrations were measured in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012. We used generalized estimating equation models to examine the associations between baseline alcohol intake and the change in HDL-cholesterol concentrations with adjustment for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, liver function, and C-reactive protein concentrations. An umbrella-shaped association was observed between total alcohol consumption and changes in HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Compared with never drinkers, past, light, moderate, and heavy drinkers experienced slower decreases in HDL cholesterol of 0.012 mmol \u00b7 L \u00b7 y (95% CI: 0.008, 0.016 mmol \u00b7 L \u00b7 y), 0.013 mmol \u00b7 L \u00b7 y (95% CI: 0.010, 0.016 mmol \u00b7 L \u00b7 y), 0.017 mmol \u00b7 L \u00b7 y (95% CI: 0.009, 0.025 mmol \u00b7 L \u00b7 y), and 0.008 mmol \u00b7 L \u00b7 y (95% CI: 0.005, 0.011 mmol \u00b7 L \u00b7 y), respectively ( < 0.0001 for all), after adjustment for potential confounders. Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with the slowest increase in total-cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride:HDL-cholesterol ratios. We observed a similar association between hard-liquor consumption and the HDL-cholesterol change. In contrast, greater beer consumption was associated with slower HDL-cholesterol decreases in a dose-response manner. Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with slower HDL-cholesterol decreases; however, the type of alcoholic beverage had differential effects on the change in the HDL-cholesterol concentration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract  Background and aims  Ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) is associated with reduced risk of cardiac and cerebral events. Arterial stiffness plays an important role in the progress of cardiac and cerebral events, but it is unclear whether ideal CVH, in particular, cumulative exposure to ideal CVH (cumCVH), is associated with reduced risk of arterial stiffness. We examined the association between cumCVH and arterial stiffness using data from the Kailuan Study.  Methods  The study cohort consisted of 20,355 participants from the Kailuan community-based cohort, whose mean follow-up period was 3.36 years since baseline (visit 3). CumCVH was calculated as the summed average ideal CVH score between two consecutive visits, multiplied by the time between the two consecutive visits in years. Multivariable linear regression model analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between cumCVH and brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV).Variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated to diagnose co-linearity between multiple variables. We also used logistic regression to evaluate the association between cumCVH and arterial stiffness by calculating the crude odds ratio (OR) and adjusted OR, with 95% confidence interval (CI). Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of our findings.  Results  The participants were classified into 5 groups according to the quintile of cumCVH exposure levels. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that cumCVH had a significant inverse linear relationship with baPWV (B\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.35,  p   Conclusions  Exposure to higher cumCVH can prevent the increase in baPWV and reduce the incidence of arterial stiffness.",

This prospective study included 79 385 participants, free of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cancer in or before 2010 (baseline). Systolic BP trajectories were identified using latent mixture modeling with data from 2006, 2008, and 2010. Incident cases of intracerebral hemorrhage and cerebral infarction occurred during 2010 to 2014, confirmed by review of medical records, by 3 physicians. We identified 5 distinct systolic BP trajectories during 2006 to 2010. Each of the trajectories was labeled according to their BP range and pattern over time: normotensive-stable (n=26 740), prehypertension-stable (n=35 674), stage 1 hypertension-increasing (n=8215), stage 1 hypertension-decreasing (n=6422), and stage 2 hypertension-stable (n=2334). We documented 1034 incident cases of cerebral infarction and 187 cases of intracerebral hemorrhage. Although the prehypertension-stable trajectory exhibited systolic BP range within the normal range (120\u2013140 mm Hg) during 2006 to 2010, this group had higher stroke risk relative to the normotensive-stable group ( P  P",

        "abstract": "Introduction:  Cross-sectional studies and short-term clinical trials suggest a linear relationship between alcohol consumption and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations although prospective data suggests the relationship may be more complex. The association between consumption of alcohol and individual alcohol beverages and longitudinal change in HDL concentrations was examined in a community-based cohort.   Methods:  This study included 80,081 Chinese adults (mean age 49 y) who were free of cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and did not use any cholesterol-lowering agents during follow-up. Alcohol intake was assessed by a questionnaire in 2006 (baseline) and participants were categorized as never, past, light (women: 0-0.4 servings/d, men: 0-0.9 servings/d), moderate (women: 0.5-1.0 servings/d, men: 1-2 servings/d), and heavy drinkers (women: u003e1.0 servings/d, men: u003e2 servings/d). HDL concentrations were measured in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012. We used generalized estimating equation models to examine the associations between baseline alcohol intake and change in HDL concentrations, adjusting for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, liver function and C-reactive protein concentrations.   Results:  An inverted U-shaped association was observed between alcohol consumption and changes in HDL. Compared with never drinkers, past, light, moderate and heavy drinkers, respectively, experienced a 0.012, 0.013, 0.017, and 0.008 mmol/l per year slower decrease rate in HDL (P    Conclusions:  Alcohol consumption was associated with slower HDL decreases, with moderate consumption slowest.

Whether elevated BP results from thickening of arterial wall or vice versa is controversial in previous studies. This study included 17 862 participants without history of myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation or flutter, or cancer and with brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and BP measurements during 2010 to 2016. Age was calculated from the self-reported birthdate to the first date of baPWV examination. Mediation analyses were applied to assess the mediation effect by baPWV in the association between age and BP. Temporal relation between baPWV and BP was assessed by cross-lagged analyses among 1508 participants with repeated assessment of baPWV. We found that systolic BP increased 0.47 (95% CI, 0.45-0.49) mm Hg per 1 year older by the mediation effect of baPWV and that the direct effect of aging on systolic BP was -0.07 (95% CI, -0.09 to -0.05) mm Hg per 1 year older. The standard regression coefficient from baseline baPWV to follow-up systolic BP was 0.09 (95% CI, 0.04-0.15), which was greater than the standard regression coefficient from baseline systolic BP to follow-up baPWV (0.01; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.06). Arterial stiffness mediated the positive association between aging and BP, and arterial stiffness might precede elevated BP.",

        "abstract": "Hyperuricemia has been shown to be associated with increased risks of gout and cardiovascular diseases. We prospectively investigated the association between the American Heart Association (AHA) ideal cardiovascular health metrics, including smoking, body mass index, dietary intake, physical activity, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose, and the risk of developing hyperuricemia.We included 77,787 Chinese adults aged 18 years or older (60,951 men and 16,836 women) without hyperuricemia at the baseline (2006) in this study. Information on the cardiovascular health metrics at baseline was collected. Incident hyperuricemia cases were identified by elevated serum uric acid concentrations, which were repeatedly assessed in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012, respectively. Cox regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident hyperuricemia according to the baseline ideal cardiovascular health metrics.We observed an inverse relation between the greater numbers of ideal cardiovascular health metrics at baseline and lower risks of developing hyperuricemia during 6 years of follow-up. After adjusting for age, sex, alcohol consumption, and other potential confounders, the hazard ratios for incident hyperuricemia were 0.95, 0.84, 0.72, and 0.64 (95% confidence intervals:0.58-0.70; P-trend<0.0001) for participants who met 2, 3, 4, and 5-7 metrics, respectively, compared with those who met 0-1 cardiovascular health metrics.Greater cardiovascular health metrics were associated with lower risk of hyperuricemia in this Chinese population, suggesting that the modifiable construct defined by the AHA could be of significance in reducing the risk of developing hyperuricemia-related diseases, such as gout.

        "abstract": "The association between blood pressure variability (BPV) and the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is not well understood. The Kailuan study is a prospective longitudinal cohort study on cerebrovascular events and cardiovascular factors. In this study, resting blood pressure was measured at baseline and every 2\u00a0years from 2006 to 2007. BPV is mainly defined as the coefficient of variation (CV). Hazard ratio (HR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated using Cox regression model. Among 52\u00a0387 participants, we identified 1817 who ended up with all-cause death and 1198 with CVD. Each 4.68% increase in BPV was associated with a 13% increase in the risk of mortality (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.13, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.09-1.18) and a 7% increase in CVD (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.07, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02-1.13), respectively. After adjustment of confounding factors, the HR of comparing participants in the highest versus lowest quartile of CV of systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 1.37 (1.19, 1.57) for all-cause death, 1.18 (1.01, 1.39) for CVD. Similar results were also observed when BPV was measured by different parameters. We concluded that visit-to-visit BPV was associated with all-cause death and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in Chinese general population.",

Various equations were derived for the optimal selection of peak kilovoltage (kVp) and exposure parameter (milliAmpere second, mAs) in computed tomography (CT), computed radiography (CR), and direct digital radiography. Logistic, logarithmic, and linear functions were employed to establish the relationship between radiation dose and diagnostic image quality. The radiation dose to the patient, as a function of image acquisition parameters (kVp, mAs) and patient size (d), was used in radiation dose and image quality optimization. Both logistic and logarithmic functions resulted in the same governing equation for optimal selection of image acquisition parameters using a dose efficiency index. For image quality as a linear function of radiation dose, the same governing equation was derived from the linear relationship. The general equations should be used in guiding clinical X-ray imaging through optimal selection of image acquisition parameters. The radiation dose to the patient could be reduced from current levels in medical X-ray imaging.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this work was to present body size and tube voltage-dependent equations for optimal selection of image acquisition parameters in guiding clinical X-ray imaging. The dose output of X-ray tubes was expressed as a function of the image acquisition parameters of tube voltage (kVp), tube current-exposure time product (mAs), and body size (d). Dose power (n) to kVp was determined to be a linear function of body size in an earlier phantom study. Tube voltage-dependent attenuation coefficients of water were used to determine the kVp effect on the depth dose of X-rays from the body's entrance surface. The new expression for the dose output of X-ray tubes in patients was then employed for image quality and radiation dose optimization, assuming that image quality is a logistic function of the radiation dose to patients. For constant kVp, the percentage of mAs increase for a 1-cm increase in body size d is dependent on the kVp applied. For constant mAs, the percentage of kVp increase for a 1-cm increase in body size is dependent on both body size d and the kVp applied. For constant body size, the percentage of kVp increase should be a fraction of the percentage of decrease in the mAs, where the fraction is dependent on the body size. The improved body size and tube voltage-dependent governing equations for variations in X-ray imaging parameters should be more accurate in guiding optimal selection of the kVp and mAs image acquisition parameters in medical X-ray imaging.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this work was to study how patient size affects the exponent of the power law relating dose to x-ray tube potential in clinical x-ray imaging using phantoms. Computed tomography (CT) dose phantoms of 16 cm and 32 cm in diameter were used to model children and adults respectively. A Fujifilm digital radiographic imaging system and a GE Discovery HD 750 CT scanner were employed to image both phantoms. For the Fujifilm radiographic imaging system, doses were measured at various locations of entrance, centre, exit as well as side locations of the phantoms using a PTW DIADOS diagnostic dosimeter. Standard procedure was employed for CT dose measurements for the GE CT scanner. X-ray exposures were varied by employing various tube voltages kVp and tube current-time product or mAs. This study found that the exponent in dose power law in phantoms increases as phantom size increases. Doses measured at body centres have lower uncertainties than those at x-ray exit surfaces. The power law exponent in phantoms was found to be a linear function of the depth from the entrance surface consistent with theoretical prediction and data from the literature. These results led to both kVp and body size dependent governing equations for the variations of imaging parameters in CT and radiographic imaging. These equations provide better estimates in guiding selection of optimal scan parameters in clinical x-ray imaging.",

In a stator current vector oriented coordinate system    $d^{{ast }}q^{{ast }}o$  , the dynamic model of SPMSM is established. Based on analysis of control performance for conventional open-loop    $I,text{--}, f$   control, the control framework of closed-loop   $I,text{--}, f$   control is presented and closed-loop regulators of angle, speed, and current are derived. Additionally, the adaptation law estimating totally unknown parameters of SPMSM is simultaneously accomplished in the design of controller and avoids construction of estimation algorithm separately. The stability of the controller is proved in the sense of Lyapunov theory. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified through both simulations and hardware experiments. The results indicate that the improved control scheme ensures the speed to track the expected value rapidly and stably in different load conditions, and the current amplitude is regulated to enlarge with the increasing of load torque automatically. Furthermore, fully unknown parameters are estimated precisely and reverse rotation of motor at startup enables to be prevented effectively.",

The derived controller guarantees tracking the reference signals of change asymptotically and has good robustness against the uncertainties of motor parameters and the perturbation of load torque.

        "abstract": "Wind power curtailment is of great importance with the increase of large-scale wind power connected to the grid. A new concept of redundant wind power accommodated by dispatching electric water heaters (EWHs) is developed in the paper. Precise predictions of wind power and EWHs load power are the basis for this work. A hybrid multi-kernel prediction approach integrating an adaptive fruit fly optimization algorithm (AFOA) and multi-kernel relevance vector machine (MKRVM) is proposed to deal with the sample distribution of multi-source heterogeneous features uncovered by an energy entropy method, where AFOA is used to determine the kernel parameters in MKRVM adaptively and avoid the arbitrariness. For the large computation of the prediction approach, parallel computation based on the Hadoop cluster is used to accelerate the calculation. Then, an economic dispatching model for accommodating wind power is built taking into account the penalty of curtailed wind power and the operating cost of EWHs. The proposed scheme is implemented in an intelligent residential district. The results show that the optimization performance of the hybrid prediction approach is superior to those of four usual optimization algorithms in this case. Regular or orderly scheduling of EWHs enables accommodation of superfluous wind power and reduces dispatch cost.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of a chemical looping combustion (CLC) process with adding a step of CH4 steam reforming, the influences of the preparation method, inert support of SiO2 or Al2O3, Ni component, particle size, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on the redox performance of a Cu-based oxygen carrier (OC) were investigated. Results showed that the OC prepared with impregnation was able to react completely with H2 in reduction or O2 in oxidation but had a relatively low oxygen content ratio (Ro) because of the limitation from saturation loading of an active component. In contrast, the OC prepared with mechanical mixing had a high Ro as well as high reactivity. The inert support was able to inhibit the sintering of the OC through dispersing the active component. Methanation and reverse CO\u2013water shift reactions occurred in the reduction step, where metallic Cu played the role of a catalyst. The utilization ratios of the OC for both reduction and oxidation increased as the size of the active component particle dec...",

We use data from the STAGES survey\nand COMBO-17 to investigate the relation between the color and structural\nproperties of the dwarfs and their location in the cluster. The definition of\nthe dwarf sample is based on the central surface brightness and includes\ngalaxies in the luminosity range -16 >= M_B >~-19 mag. Using a fit to the color\nmagnitude relation of the dwarfs, our sample is divided into a red and blue\nsubsample. We find a color-density relation in the projected radial\ndistribution of the dwarf sample: at the same luminosity dwarfs with redder\ncolors are located closer to the cluster centers than their bluer counterparts.\nFurthermore, the redder dwarfs are on average more compact and rounder than the\nbluer dwarfs. These findings are consistent with theoretical expectations\nassuming that bright early-type dwarfs are the remnants of transformed\nlate-type disk galaxies involving processes such as ram pressure stripping and\ngalaxy harassment. This indicates that a considerable fraction of dwarf\nelliptical galaxies in clusters are the results of transformation processes\nrelated to interactions with their host cluster.",

Studies have indicated that high mobility group A1 (HMGA1), an important member of the HMGA family, plays a role in the pathogenesis and progression of malignant tumors, including breast cancer. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of HMGA1 in breast cancer. Interestingly, we found that HMGA1 expression was significantly higher in breast cancer tissues than in adenoma tissues and closely correlated with the clinical stage and histological grade in breast cancer patients. Further study showed that HMGA1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Thus, the results demonstrated that HMGA1 could act as an independent prognostic indicator in breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Recent studies have shown that P-selectin deletion inhibits tumor growth in Rip1-Tag2 mice by suppressing platelet accumulation in tumor tissues. This study aimed to evaluate whether and how P-selectin affects tumor stiffness in Rip1-Tag2 mice. To explore the role of P-selectin in tissue stiffness, we demonstrated that tumor progression in Rip1-Tag2 mice was correlated with tissue stiffness using immunofluorescence and histological staining. Furthermore, we showed that P-selectin deficiency significantly decreased tissue stiffness by inhibiting lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression. Our experiments involving Rip1-Tag2 mice treated with the LOX inhibitor BAPN showed that BAPN significantly abolished collagen deposition to decrease tumor stiffness and thus inhibit tumor growth. These results indicate that P-selectin deletion significantly decreases tumor stiffness in Rip1-Tag2 mice by inhibiting LOX expression. Further study demonstrated that P-selectin-mediated platelet accumulation increases tissue stiffness mainly by increasing LOX expression and thus promotes tumor growth. Therefore, P-selectin may be an effective therapeutic targeting for treating human insulinomas.",

Moreover, the effect of nano-TiN on the gradient cemented carbide was studied. It is found that gradient zone width increases slightly with nano-TiN introduction. Both cobalt and titanium concentrations reach the maximum near the gradient border. Tungsten concentration shows fluctuation from the surface to the bulk. (Ti,W)C phase grains are refined for nitrogen introduction. Core-rim structure has been observed under the SEM back-scattered mode. The core appears as dark due to more titanium in it and the rim with more tungsten appears as grey. In addition, the hardness and transverse rupture strength of gradient cemented carbide are enhanced with nano-TiN introduced.",
