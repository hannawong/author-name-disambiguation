        "abstract": "Axi is a low-sulfidation type epithermal gold deposit hosted in Paleozoiz continental volcanic rocks in western Tianshan, Xinjiang, China. SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating shows that the age of fifth member of Dahalajunshan formation, which is the host rocks of the Axi mine, is 363.2 \u00b1 5.7Ma. The new age possesses two implications: Firstly, the volcanic host rocks of the Axi gold mine were formed in the late Devonian, not in the early Carboniferous or Triassic to Cretaceous period, which were believed as the ages of the host rocks by most previous researchers; Secondly, the metallogenic age of the Axi gold deposit is the early Paleozoic, varying between 363.2 \u00b1 5.7Ma to Visean period of the early Carboniferous.",

        "title": "Fluid inclusions in quartz veins from HP-UHP metamorphic rocks Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD) project",
        "abstract": "Preliminary petrographic observations and microthermometric measurements show that three types of fluid inclusions occur in quartz veins and late-stage carbonate veins in high- and ultra-high-pressure (HP-UHP) rocks from the CCSD area (Donghai). Fluids include brine (NaCl-H2O) inclusions (type I), NaCl-CaCl2-H2O inclusions (type II), and N2-CH4 inclusions (type III). Type I fluids are divided into medium-high salinity (type Ia), medium salinity (type Ib), and low salinity (type Ic) inclusions. The type III inclusions are the first discovered in the CCSD area. Type Ia, Ib, and II inclusions are primary or pseudosecondary in origin and occur in vein- and matrix quartz in eclogites. Their absence in vein- and matrix quartz and in the amphibolite-facies gneisses suggests that Ia, Ib, and, II inclusions were probably captured during decompression-recrystallization and retrograde metamorphism of the eclogite. In contrast, type Ic inclusions are widely distributed, and were probably captured in the last stage of UHP exhumation. N2-CH4 pure gaseous inclusions are mostly primary, and mainly occur as isolated or clustered inclusions in laminated quartz veins in eclogite together with types Ia and Ib inclusions; this implies that type III inclusions were probably captured under HP-UHP metamorphic conditions. Most quartz veins in eclogite probably formed by decompression-recrystallization and retrograde metamorphism during exhumation of the subducted plate, whereas quartz veins in the gneisses mainly formed at amphibolite-facies or late-stage retrograde metamorphism during exhumation. The distinct differences between fluid inclusions in quartz veins in eclogites versus those in gneisses, and the similarities among fluid inclusions in quartz veins and matrix quartz crystals in their respective hosting rocks suggests that metamorphic fluids expelled from the HP-UHP rocks during the exhumation migrated mainly at the grain scale.

        "abstract": "The Zhemulang gold deposit is located to the south of the east section of the Yarhing Zangbo tectonic suture zone in the southern Tibet The gold ore bodies are controlled by the secondary brittle fractures of the large-scale brittle-ductile shear zone. Microthermometric measurements and Laser Raman analysis show that auriferous quartz veins of the Zhemulang gold deposit contain three types of fluid inclusions: NaCl-H 2O inclusions (type I) ; CO 2 brine inclusions (type II) , which can be subdivided into two-phase (type IIa) and three-phase (type lib) inclusions; Pure gaseous inclusions (type III). The NaCl-H 2O inclusions have salinity values of 2.31% - 7.39% NaCleqv, with a peak of 4.0% - 7.0% NaCleqv and an average of 5.33% NaCleqv, homogenization temperature values of 164.5 - 273. 1\u00b0C, with a peak of 220 - 240\u00b0C and an average of 221.0\u00b0C , and density values of 0.82 - 0.93g\u00b7cm -3, with a peak of 0.84 - 0.90g \u00b7 cm -3 and an average of 0.88g cm -3, suggesting that the are-forming fluids of the Zhemulang gold deposit is characteristics by high content of CO 2, low salinity, low to moderate homogenization temperature and low density, which are similar to those of typical orogenic gold deposits. H-O-C isotopic analyses show that \u03b4D H2O = -36.7\u2030 - -107.5\u2030, \u03b4 18O H2O = 4.1\u2030 - 5.5\u2030, \u03b4 13C = -9.6\u2030 - -11.5\u2030 in Zhemulang gold deposit, indicating that the ore-forming fluids is composed mainly of metamorphic fluid, with addition of mantle-derived fluid.

        "abstract": "Platinum group elements (PGE), Au contents and Os isotopic compositions in ferromanganese crusts and their basaltic substrates from the central and west Pacific Ocean were analyzed. The results show that their PGE and Au contents are quite high and greatly varied, the \u2211PGE is (70.09 \u223c 629.26) \u00d7 10-9 and the total Au is (0.60 \u223c 26900) \u00d7 10-9 respectively. In the three-layered (outer, porous and compact layers) crusts, the \u2211PGE contents of porous ((339.37 \u223c 545.82) \u00d7 10-9) and compact ((280.09 \u223c 629.26) \u00d7 10-9) layers are significantly higher than the outer ((70.09 \u223c 133.27) \u00d7 10-9) layers. The single-layered crusts are also enriched in PGE (\u2211PGE = (83.94 \u223c 479.75) \u00d7 10-9), and their Au contents are usually higher than the three-layered ones. In addation, \u2211PGE and Au contents of ferromanganese crusts are much higher than that in the nodules (\u2211PGE = (101.57 \u223c 155.83) \u00d7 10-9, Au = (1 - 4) \u00d7 10-9). Different sedimentary water depths and oxygen fugacity of the ambient sea water of the crust and nodules may be the major reason for their different PGE and Au contents. \u2211PGE and Pt are positively correlated with Mn % but inversely correlated with Fe %, which is just contrary to that in nodules, suggesting that PGE in the crusts may mainly occur in manganese mineral phases such as vernadites (\u03b4-MnO2), while the PGE in the nodules may predominantly occur in iron mineral phases such as goethites(FeOOH \u00b7 nH2O). Chondrite-normalized patters and various geochemical parameters of PGE demonstrate that PGE and Au in the ferromanganese crusts were sourced from water/rock reaction between the basaltic substrates and seawater, and partly from extraterrestrial materials such as iron meteorite dusts, but not related to submarine hydrothermal venting. Calculation based on cobalt contents show that ferromanganese crusts in the west Pacific Ocean began to grow at about 42.5Ma, and underwent two growth hiatuses corresponding to the geological ages of 21.8Ma and 8.0Ma respectively. The growth rates of the outer, porous and compact layers are 2.64mm/Ma, 1.45mm/Ma and 1.06mm/Ma, and the 187Os/188Os of the corresponding ambient sea water are 0.948 \u223c 0.953, 0.599 \u223c 0.673 and 0.425 \u223c 0.536 separately, implying that the outer layers contained more continental eroded dusts, while the sediments in the porous and compact layers were mainly sourced from submarine basalt alteration and extraterrestrial materials such as interplanetary dust particles (IDPs).",

Ore bodies are controlled by the secondary fractures in the large-scale brittle-ductile shear zone. Its geological and geochemical characteristics show that it is an orogenic gold deposit. In this study, He-Ar-S isotopic compositions of ore-forming fluids in pyrites collected from the Bangbu auriferous quartz veins were analyzed, and the results show that 3He/4He ratio is 0.174 to 1.010R a, 40Ar/39Ar ratio ranges from 311. 9 to 1724. 9, and \u03b434S is 2. 8% \u223c 4. l%, averaging 3. 6%: whereas pyrite collected from country rocks has 3He/4He ratio of 0.01137Ra, 40Ar/36 Ar of 1709.7, and \u03b434S of 6.5%, suggesting that the ore-forming fluid of the Bangbu gold deposit was a mixture of crust fluid and mantle-derived fluid, and the former is predominant. The ration of mantle-derived He is 2. 7% \u223c 16.7%. Crust-mantle interaction and the subsequent injection of mantle-derived fluids might have played an important role in the mineralization of the Bangbu gold deposit. During collision between India plate and Asia plate, large-scale vertical lithospheric shear zones were formed, and the subsequent mantle-derived fluid went up through the shear zone, mixing with the lower crust derived CO2-rich fluid. The mixed ore-forming fluids migrated to the secondary brittle structures in the shear zone, and finally precipitated auriferous sulfide quartz ores because of decline of temperature and pressure and subsequent boiling of the ore-forming fluids.",

In situ REE compositions of apatites in various degrees retrograde eclogites, amphibolite, amphibolite schist and paragneiss from of CCSD and nearby outcropped locations were determined by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry( LA-ICP-MS), the results indicate that the REE contents and related parameters of the apatites vary considerably. Chondrite-normalized distribution patterns of apatites can be divided into three types: I, LREE-enriched type, its \u2211REE reaches a high concentration to n \u00d7 1000 \u00d7 10-6; II, MREE-enriched type, its La/Sm ratios less than 1 and \u03b4Eu vary greatly; III, HREE-enriched type, its \u2211REE is very low, only 9.228 \u00d7 10-6, the chondrite-normalied patterns are left-leaning with marked negative Eu anomalies. Besides, in situ REE analyses on apatite grains show that \u2211LREE decline gradually from core to the margins, suggesting that the apatite-bearing rocks might have suffered a shortlived heating and even partial melting during exhumation. During the partial melting, LREE were selectively released with other large radius ions.",

        "abstract": "Massive to irregular veins apatites were recognized in quartz veins of CCSD UHP rocks such as eclogite. Abundant exsolutions in the apatite veins were found under microscope. Electron microscope and laser raman spectroscopy analyses show that the apatite is fluorapatite, and the exsolutions can be divided into four types: A. irregular magnetite and hematite intergrowth; B. needle-like hematite exsolution; C. platy to rhombic monazite exsolution; D. needle-like strontium barite exsolution. Type A exsolutions are parallel with the C axis of apatite and with a length of 10 \u223c 50\u03bcm; Type B are also parallel with the C axis of apatite with a width of only 0.5 \u223c 2\u03bcm, mostly about 1.5\u03bcm, and a greatly-varied length of 6 \u223c 50\u03bcm; The width and length of type C monazite exsolutions are about 6 \u223c 10\u03bcm, mostly 6\u03bcm, and about 50 \u223c 75\u03bcm, respectively; Type D strontium barite exsolutions coexist mostly with type B hematite exsolution, with a width of about 1.5\u03bcm and a length of about 60 \u223c 70\u03bcm. Type A, B and D exsolutions in apatite are firstly reported. Most of the exsolutions are parallel with C axis of the apatite, implying that they were probably exsolved synchronously. Appearance of apatite veins in CCSD UHP rocks and discovery of large amount of iron oxides, phosphate and sulfate exsolutions in the apatite suggest that rapid exhumation of the CCSD UHP rocks resulted in large-scale minerals decomposition and formation of large amount of H2O-SiO2 melt, as well as a little amount of phosphate melt. Meanwhile, iron oxide melt might have been added. The exsolutions in the CCSD apatite veins were formed under relative oxidation environment.",

        "abstract": "Being one of the largest gold deposits in Ailaoshan gold belt, the Daping gold deposit is hosted in a ductile deformed and alterated diorite batholith, and is believed to be a typical Cenozoic orogenic type gold deposit In this study, SHRIMP U-Pb dating of ziicon from the diorite batholith was performed, and the result is 773 \u00b1 12Ma, suggesting that the diorite was a Late Proterozoic batholith, but not a commonly recognized Caledonian rock body. The diorite batholith is a product of large-scale basic to acidic magmatism during the Jinning-Chengjiang epoch, and is corresponding to a period of Gondwana accretion after Rodinian dispersion. The forming age of the diorite is nearly the same as the high temperature 40Ar- 39 Ar plateau age (765.5 \u00b17. OMa) of fluid inclusions in Daping auriferous quartz veins, suggesting that the Daping gold deposit was formed during multiple metallogenic epochs; the major ore body was formed during Cenozoic orogeny, while the gold mineralization was started during Jinning orogeny. Cenozoic epoch zircons are also recognized in the diorite, and the age 33.7 \u00b1 1. 1Ma is nearly the same as the 40Ar- 39 Ar age (33.76Ma) of hydrothermal sericite from the Daping auriferous quartz veins, suggesting that the some of the zircons were probably formed during extensively ductile deformation and subsequent magmatic partial melting.",

In the CCSD profile, with increasing depth, the \u03b418O of the quartz veins vary greatly and are in the form of \"\u03a3\", which show very low values at depth of 900m to 1500m and 2700m, and high values at depth of 1770m and 4000m, implying that the water/rock interactions between the protoliths and the meteoric water before subduction were controlled by heats and contact metamorphism associated with the local magmatic intrusions. The vertical variation of the CCSD quartz veins's \u03b418O are similar to those of the rock-forming minerals of the HP-UHP metamorphic rocks, suggesting that the quartz veins probably underwent HP, even UHP metamorphism, but most of them were formed by decompression-recrystallization and retrograde metamorphism of the CCSD HP-UHP metamorphic rocks. The great inhomogeneous distribution of the \u03b418O of quartz veins in the CCSD and in the outcropped HP-UHP metamorphic rocks, as well as the big crystals in the Donghai County, suggests that the metamorphic fluids expelled from the HP-UHP metamorphic rocks during the exhumation were locally migrated at the grain scale. Besides, the similarities of \u03b4D-\u03b418O compositions between the Donghai crystals and the CCSD quartz veins imply that they possess similar genesis and mainly formed during exhumation of the subducted plate in the Late Triassic Epoch.",

        "abstract": "Daping is one of the largest Cenozoic orogenic type gold deposits in Ailaoshan gold belt. Gold ores in the Daping may be divided into two types: (1) Late Proterozoic diorite hosted: (2) Maludong Formation of Middle Devonian (D2m) limestone hosted. In this study, H-O-C-S isotopic compositions of fluid inclusions, hydrothermal carbonate minerals and sulphides from the Daping auriferous quartz veins were analysed, and the results show that: In the diorite hosted gold ores, the \u03b418OH2O and \u03b4D are 2.39% \u223c 7. 59% and-85% \u223c-60%, the \u03b413 C of hydrothermal carbonate minerals are-4.7% \u223c-4.6%, \u03b434 S of pyrite and galena are-2.8% \u223c 7. 6% (average 3. 1%) and 0.2% \u223c 6.3% (average 2. 0%), respectively, while in the Middle Devonian (D2m) limestone hosted gold ores, the \u03b418OH2O and \u03b4D are 4.36% \u223c 6.82% and-75% \u223c-67%, 513C of hydrothermal carbonate minerals are-7. 6% \u223c-0.5%, \u03b434S of pyrite are 2.2% \u223c 10.2% (average 6.5%), respectively, suggesting that stable isotopic compositions of ore-forming fluids in the two different type gold ores are nearby the same. Both of their ore-forming fluids and materials might have derived from same source Lower crust and upper mantle. Daping is a typical ductile shear zone controlled mesothermal gold deposit, crust-mantle interaction occurred at the early of Himalayan Orogeny might have played an important role in its mineralization. At about 33Ma ago, the middle and lower crust in the Daping area suffered high temperature and high pressure metamorphism because of ductile deformation and upwelling upper mantle magmas. The ore-forming fluids enriched in CO2, which were generated by granulitization and firing of the upwelling upper mantle magma, were transported to the middle to upper crust along the ductile shear zone, and finally precipitated auriferous sulfide-quartz veins in the brittle structures in diorite batholith or D 2m limestone because of declined temperature and pressure and subsequent boiling. Lithologic characters of wall rocks is not an important controlling factors in mineralization of Daping gold mine.",

        "abstract": "Concentration of platinum group elements(PGE) of various gold ores and around rocks and Re-Os isotopic compositions of major ore minerals of Daping gold deposit were analyzed by using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with nickel sulfide fire assay pre-concentration and carius tube decomposing technique with acetone extracted Re method. The results show that the total PGE (\u2211PGE) in the gold ores are greatly varied, varying between 3.91 \u00d7 10-9 to 61.64 \u00d7 10-9 and averaging 25.93 \u00d7 10-9, which are similar to that of the Himalayan lamprophyre dykes(22.19 \u00d7 10-9) and much higher than those of the Caledonian diorite around rocks ((2.79-4.75) \u00d7 10-9). Parameter Pt/Pt* of the gold ores are 0.01-0.9, with an average of 0.249, closing to that of the lamprophyre dykes (0.45), and much lower than those of the diorite (1.38-1.57). Chondrite normalized patterns of the gold ores show marked negative Pt and Ir and positive Ru and Rh anomalies, which are also similar to that of the lamprophyre dykes but obviously different from those of the diorite, suggesting that gold mineralization was closey related to the lamprophyre intrusion, and the oreforming materials didn't derive mainly from the diorite. Element ratios of the PGE show that the lamprophyre dykes was formed by partial melting of a depleted mantle which had undergone extraction of mafic magma and metasomatism, and the primary magma was sulfur saturated. Re/Os ratios of the ore minerals are quite high, varying between 6.36 to 121.67, and \u03b3Os(t) are 290.21-810.24, averaging 492.92. Besides 187Os/188OS(t) of the ore minerals are 0.495-1.154, which are much higher than the initial 187Os/188Os ratio of chondrite (0. 12679) at the gold metallogenic age (33.55Ma), implying that crust-derived radiogenic 187Os might have been added during gold mineralization. PGE geochemistry and Re-Os isotopic compositions indicate that genesis of the Daping gold deposit was closely related to strong crust-mantle interaction in the Ailaoshan area since the Cenozoic era, and the ore-forming fluids was mixture of the mantle-derived fluids formed by the upper mantle degassing and the CO2-riching fluids from the lower crust released by dehydration and roasting triggered by the rising hot mantle magma's heat. The shear zone provided channel for fluid migration and mixing, and the ore-forming fluids migrated up along micro-fractures in the shear zone, reacted with the diorite, and finally deposited the ore minerals in the brittle structures of the shear zone because of water-rock interaction and boiling. Thus, the Daping is a typical shear zone controlled mesothermal gold deposit.",

Exsolutions in omphacites in eclogites from the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Project main hole (CCSD-MH) and Pre-pilot 1(CCSD-PP1) were studies by using laserRaman and electron microprobe analysis, and numerous parallel quartz bars (or needles) were found. For comparison, omphacites in CCSD eclogites without any quartz exsolution were also analysed. The results indicate that the omphacites with quartz exsolution is supersilicic. Ultrahigh-pressure experiments shown that part of silica can form octahedral coordination structure, if pressure is high enough. It's proposed that decline of pressure will facilitate quartz exsolution. The peak pressure of UHP metamorphism indicated by quartz exsolutions in the CCSD omphacites is much higher than 2.5GPa, which was estimated by the previous researchers based on facies transformation of quartz-coesite and graphite-diamond, suggests that subuduction depth of the Su-Lu UHP metamorphic belts may be greater than commonly recognized 80-120km.",

They are: (1) brine (NaCI-H2O) inclusions (type I), which can be subdivided into high salinity(type Ia), medium-high salinity (type Ib), medium salinity (type Ic) and low salinity(type Id) brine inclusions; (2)N2-CH4 pure gaseous inclusions (type II) ; (3) Calcite daughter mineral-bearing inclusions (type III) ; (4) CO2,-NaCI-H2 O and pure CO2, inclusions(type IV). The type III and IV ones are first discovered in the CCSD. Type Ia, Ib, II, III and IV inclusions mainly occur as primary ones in quartz veins in eclogites and gneisses, indicating that they were probably captured in decompression-recrystallization stage of the HP-UHP metamorphic rocks. Type Ic and Id inclusions occur mostly as secondary ones in matrix quartz in eclogites and gneisses, implying that they were captured in the later retrograde stage. The H2O-carbonate inclusions and CO2, inclusions occurring as primary ones, suggest that a part of the quartz veins and their host rocks might have undergone UHP metamorphism. The quartz veins in the CCSD were probably formed in the stage of decompression-recrystallization, while the metamorphic fluid expelled from exhumation of the HP-UHP rocks in CCSD chiefly flowed at grain scale.",

Compared with age of rutiles (218Ma) from Dabie area and the closed temperature around 500\u00b0C, it suggested that the age may represent a cooling age, but not the peak age of UHP metamorphism. The rutile mineralization occurs mainly during the peak of UHP metamorphism, and the age around 210Ma may represent the recrystallization during the amphiholite-facies retrogression stage of eclogites. This age also imply that subduction and exhumation of slab was quite quick in CCSD area. In addition, this study also shows that rutile is a suitable accessory mineral for U-Pb dating and rutile age can be used as a complementary method to explain the zircon SHRIMP age.",

        "title": "Channelized fluids in subducted continental crust: Constraints from D-18O of quartz and fluid inclusions in quartz veins from the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Project",
        "abstract": "Fluid inclusions hosted by quartz veins in high-pressure to ultrahigh-pressure (HP-UHP) metamorphic rocks from the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD) Project main drillhole have low, varied hydrogen isotopic compositions (D = -97 to -69). Quartz \u03b418O values range from -2.5 to 9.6; fluid inclusions hosted in quartz have correspondingly low \u03b418O values of -11.66 to 0.93 (Th = 171.2318.8C). The low D and \u03b418O isotopic data indicate that protoliths of some CCSD HP-UHP metamorphic rocks reacted with meteoric water at high latitude near the surface before being subducted to great depth. In addition, the \u03b418O of the quartz veins and fluid inclusions vary greatly with the drillhole depth. Lower \u03b418O values occur at depths of 900-1000 m and 2700 m, whereas higher values characterize rocks at depths of about 1770 m and 4000 m, correlating roughly with those of wall-rock minerals. Given that the peak metamorphic temperature of the Dabie-Sulu UHP metamorphic rocks was about 800\u00b0C or higher, much higher than the closure temperature of oxygen isotopes in quartz under wet conditions, such synchronous variations can be explained by re-equilibration. In contrast, \u03b4D values of fluid inclusions show a different relationship with depth. This is probably because oxygen is a major element of both fluids and silicates and is much more abundant in the quartz veins and silicate minerals than is hydrogen. The oxygen isotope composition of fluid inclusions is evidently more susceptible to late-stage re-equilibration with silicate minerals than is the hydrogen isotope composition. Therefore, different \u03b4D and \u03b418O patterns imply that dramatic fluid migration occurred, whereas the co-variation of oxygen isotopes in fluid inclusions, quartz veins, and wall-rock minerals can be better interpreted by re-equilibration during exhumation. Quartz veins in the Dabie-Sulu UHP metamorphic terrane are the product of high-Si fluids. Given that channelized fluid migration is much faster than pervasive flow, and that the veins formed through precipitation of quartz from high-Si fluids, the abundant veins indicate significant fluid mobilization and migration within this subducted continental slab. Many mineral reactions can produce high-Si fluids. For UHP metamorphic rocks, major dehydration during subduction occurred when pressure-temperature conditions exceeded the stability of lawsonite. In contrast, for low-temperature eclogites and other HP metamorphic rocks with peak metamorphic P-T conditions within the stability field of lawsonite, dehydration and associated high-Si fluid release may have occurred as hydrous minerals were destabilized at lower pressure during exhumation. Because subduction is a continuous process whereas only a minor fraction of the subducted slabs returns to the surface, dehydration during underflow is more prevalent than exhumation even in subducted continental crust, which is considerably drier than altered oceanic crust. \u00a9 2010 Taylor & Francis.",

        "abstract": "The Jinbaoshan and Baimazhai ore deposits are two magmatic sulfide deposits hosted in the Emeishan large igneous provinces. In this paper, platinum group elements (PGE) geochemistry of the two deposits were compared, and the results show that the Jinbaoshan is characterized by high total PGE (\u2211PGE), low (Cu+ Ni), Pd/Ir (3.84-26.49), Cu/Pd (46.91-1309.58) and Au/Pd ratios. On the contrary, the Baimazhai is characterized by low \u2211PGE, high (Cu+Ni), Pd/Ir (4.72-297.2), Cu/Pd (10875.13-974788.55) and Au/Pd ratios. The two deposits have enantiomorphous primitive mantle normalized PGE patterns. The Jinbaoshan mine has more obvious positive correlation among PGE elements and Cu, Ni than the Baimazhai, probably implying that the PGE compositions in the Baimazhai intrusive was disturbed as its parent magma had experienced more complicated evolutional processes than the Jinbaoshan. Based on analytical data of this study and Yangliuping Cu-Ni-PGE deposit, the Cu-Ni-PGE ore formation processes of the Emei mantle plume are divided into three stages: 1) the Jinbaoshan stage, namely low S-saturation stage, during which the Emei mantle plume was mixed with a little crust material and just changed into S-saturated from unsaturated at the beginning of ascending, that a little sulfide melt segregated from silicate. Because of high patition coefficient of PGE between sulfide and silicate melt, a little sulfide melt can scavenge a large number of PGE from silicate melt. Consequently, the Jinbaoshan independent Pt-Pd deposit was formed by cumulation of a little PGE-enriched sulfide and the co-crystallizing olivine, pyroxene, chromite, etc. at high temprature; 2) the Yangliuping stage, or moderate S-saturated stage, during which the continuously ascending Emei mantle plume absorbed more crustal material and became moderately S-saturated and resulted in more PGE, Cu and Ni segretated from the silicate. More PGE, Cu and Ni accumulated and formed the Yangliuping deposit. 3) the Baimazhai stage, or high S-saturated stage, within which the terminal Emei mantle plume absorbed a lot of crustal material and became highly S-saturated, resulting in strong sulfide segregation. Cu, Ni and PGE in the silicate segregated with sulfide melt and formed independent Cu-Ni deposit.",

        "title": "Geology, geochemistry, and genesis of orogenic gold-antimony mineralization in the Himalayan Orogen, South Tibet, China",
        "abstract": "The southern Tibet AuSb metallogenic belt in the Himalayan orogen consists of more than 50 gold, gold-antimony and antimony lode deposits, and associated placer gold deposit. The deposits are hosted in a Mesozoic metamorphosed turbidite sequence of the Indian passive continental margin. The Zhemulang Au deposit, Mazhala AuSb deposit, and Shalagang Sb deposit are three typical examples of such epizonal orogenic deposits. At Zhemulang, gold-bearing quartz veins occur in the Upper Triassic Songre Formation, consisting of carbonaceous phyllite and slate. Ore minerals are native gold, pyrite, galena, chalcopyrite, and limonite. At Mazhala, the gold- and stibnite-bearing quartz vein orebodies are hosted in Lower to Middle Jurassic slate, interlayered with metastandstone, metasiltstone, and limestone of the Lure Formation. Ore minerals are native gold, stibnite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, and trace amount of cinnabar. At Shalagang, the host rocks are Lower Cretaceous sandstone, siltstone, muddy limestone, and chert of the Duojiu Formation. Orebodies consist mainly of stibnite-bearing quartz veins and locally altered fault breccia. Ore minerals are stibnite, cinnabar, valentinite [Sb2O3], limonite, and trace amount of pyrite, arsenopyrite, and realgar. For the three deposits, the wallrock alteration has produced the minerals silica, carbonates, white mica, sulfide and chlorite. The three deposits have a similar element associations, but with a few slight variations. The Zhemulang, Mazhala, and Shalagang deposits, in order of element enrichments relative to crustal abundance, are anomalous in Au, Sb, Te, Bi, As, Pb, Ag, and W; Sb, Au, Te, As, Pb, Bi, Ag and W, to Sb, Te, As, Au, Hg, W, Pb, and Ag, respectively, and all depleted in Cu, Zn, Sn, and Mo.Various aqueous, carbonic, and hydrocarbon fluid inclusions were recognized in quartz and/or stibnite at the three deposits. These include type 1a one-phase aqueous inclusions, type 1b two-phase aqueous inclusions, type 2a carbonic inclusions, type 2b aqueous-carbonic inclusion, and rare type 3 hydrocarbon inclusions that include two-phase hydrocarbon inclusions (type 3a) and dark one-phase hydrocarbon inclusions (type 3b). The three deposits have the similar low-salinity H2OCO2CH4N2 ore fluids with trace amounts of hydrocarbons. For the Zhemulang, Mazhala, and Shalagang deposits, the salinities of aqueous inclusion range mainly between 3.3 and 6.4wt.% NaCl equiv., 2.5 and 4.9wt.% NaCl equiv. and 4.1 and 6.4wt.% NaCl equiv., respectively. The ore-forming temperatures vary mainly from 180 to 320\ufffd\ufffdC, 160 to 300\ufffd\ufffdC and 140 to 240\ufffd\ufffdC, respectively. The estimated mineralization depths are 4 to 6km, 3 to 5km, and 1 to 4km of the epizonal environment, respectively. The different mineralization temperatures and pressures led to the different element enrichments at the three deposits.For the Zhemulang, Mazhala and Shalagang deposits, ore fluid isotopic compositions are \ufffd\ufffdDH2O -107.5 to -36.7\ufffd\ufffd and \ufffd\ufffd18Ofluid 2.8 to 8.2\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffdDH2O -119.0 to -72.7\ufffd\ufffd and \ufffd\ufffd18Ofluid 7.5 to 16.2\ufffd\ufffd, and \ufffd\ufffdDH2O -173.4 to -139.2\ufffd\ufffd and \ufffd\ufffd18Ofluid 7.5 to 12.3\ufffd\ufffd, respectively; \ufffd\ufffd13Cfluid values are -11.7 to -9.6\ufffd\ufffd, -3.5 to -2.5\ufffd\ufffd, and -6.5 to -5.1\ufffd\ufffd, respectively; and \ufffd\ufffd34S values are -4.0 to -1.1\ufffd\ufffd, -0.8 to 2.3\ufffd\ufffd, and -3.9 to 2.1\ufffd\ufffd, respectively. The ore-forming fluids were partly derived from metamorphic devolatilization of immediate or deeper level country rocks, with a deposit's corresponding metamorphic degree controlling the fluid PTX. The ore-forming fluid for Zhemulang, Mazhala, and Shalagang consisted of predominantly metamorphic water with minor involvement of meteoric water, a mixture of metamorphic fluid and meteoric water, and predominantly meteoric water, respectively. Ore metals were derived from country rocks, including synsedimentary Sedex-like sulfide layers in the Jurassic strata observed at the Mazhala AuSb deposit. Among three deposits, the variation of \ufffd\ufffd13Cfluid and \ufffd\ufffd34S reflects the fact that the Zhemulang Au deposit formed from a relatively high content of organic carbon and low f{hook}O2 fluid, the Mazhala AuSb deposit from a relatively low content of organic carbon and high f{hook}O2 fluid, and the Shalagang Sb deposit from an intermediate content of organic carbon and f{hook}O2 fluid. Fluid immiscibility was the main mechanism for ore metal precipitation at all three deposits. The vertical zonation of Au, AuSb, and Sb mineralization suggests that additional gold resources may exist below the antimony or gold-antimony orebodies. Stream sediment and soil geochemical surveys and the occurrence of placer gold prospects are effective for identifying areas of orogenic gold and antimony deposits in the Himalayan and other orogens. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Scheelite is a widely-distributed accessory mineral in auriferous quartz veins in Daping gold deposit, China. Trace elements, rare earth elements (REE) and Nd-Sr isotopic compositions of the scheelite were determined respectively by ICP-MS and mass spectrograph in this work. The results show that the scheelite is enriched with Sr, Ba and depleted with Mo, Bi, Sn, Nb and Ta, indicating that primitive ore-forming fluid of the Daping mine probably didn't derive from magmatic crystallization and differentiation, and was not a mixed fluid of magmatic and meteoric water proposed by many previous researchers. The scheelites picked from different samples possess very similar MREE-enriched and dextral-inclined chondrite-normalied patterns and positive Eu anomaly, suggesting that intensive REE differentiation occurred between the scheelites and the ore-forming fluid, REE were substituted in Ca2+ site of the scheelites by charge compensation mechanism (REE3+ + Na+ = 2Ca2+), and the primitive ore-forming fluid was a relative high temperature, Na+ enriched and reducing hydrothermal system. High correlation of trace elements and REE compositions in scheelites and diorite around rocks and their alterations suggests that relative intensive fluid-rock interaction occurred before the scheelites precipitation. Sr-Nd isotopic composition of the scheelites indicates the primitive mineralizing fluid derived predominantly from the lower crust, but interfusion of the mantle-derived fluid could not be excluded. The primitive mineralizing fluid had close relationship with the regional ductile deformation in the mining district, the ductile shear zone penetrated the crust, induced CO2 enriched fluid ascended from the lower crust, and gave birth to intensive fluid-rock interaction with the diorite rock. Formation of the brittle fractures in the shear zone triggered transportation, concentration and boiling of the ore-forming fluid and precipitation of the ore minerals.",

        "title": "Geochemistry of epidotes in HP-UHP metamorphic rocks from Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD) Project and Qinglongshan area: An indicator of partial melting during continental slab exhumation",
        "abstract": "Epidote is one of the water-bearing minerals which can keep stable during peak ultra-high pressure ( UHP) metamorphism. Its compositional variation can be used as indicators of metamorphic conditions and process, because of its wide range of stable conditions of temperature and pressure. In this study, major and trace elements of epidotes in eclogite, paragneiss and orthogneiss from CCSD and Qinglongshan in Sulu UHP terrance are determined by electronic microprobe and LA-ICPMS, and the results indicate that the epidotes possess multiple genesis. They were formed during both prograde and retrograde stages and can be divided into many generations. The variation of major elements can be denoted by XFe ( XFe = Fe3+/( Al3+ + Cr3 + + Fe3 + + Mn3+ ) ) which is the function of metamorphic conditions (P, T, fo2) . The XFe change from high in the core to low in the margin of porphyroblastic epidotes which formed during prograde stage, but the epidotes formed during retrograde stage just on the contrary. The concentration of LILE (large ion lithophile elements) such as\u2211REE, Sr, Ba, Rb, Th and Pb change from high in the core to low in the margin during the retrograde stage. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns of allanites, which were retrograded into epidotes in margin in paragneiss, vary from LREE-enriched type in the core to quite flat one in the margin. The depletion of LILE in the epidotess margin may not result from metamorphic water/rock interaction during metamorphism, but probably attribute to partial melting during retrograde stage. High REE and Sr contents and wide stable conditions make epidote a suitable carrier of trace elements such as REE and Sr to the deep crust or mantle during subduction.",

        "title": "Composition and evolution of ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic fluids: A fluid inclusion study of the drill cores from main hole of Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Program",
        "abstract": "The main hole of the Chinese continental scientific drilling project is located in Donghai county in the east segment of the Dabie-Sulu ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt. With a depth of 5100 m, the lithology of the upper part 2050 m of the hole consists mainly of eclogite, ortho- and paragneisses, garnet peridotite (pyroxenite) and some schist and quartzite. These rocks have experienced UHP metamorphism and later amphibolite-facies retrogression. Five types of fluid inclusions with different compositions are found in the rocks by detailed petrographic observation and Raman analysis of fluid inclusions. They are: (1) aqueous inclusions of medium-low salinity (type I) which occur either as primary inclusions in the magmatic cores and UHP-metamorphic rims of zircon grains of eclogite and gneisses, in omphacite, zoesite and in calcite- and quartz blebs encompassed by omphacite, or as exsolution inclusions in apatite, or mainly as secondary inclusions along transgranular fractures in omphacite, garnet, kyanite, zoesite and quartz of eclogite; aqueous inclusions also occur in isolation or cluster in calcite veins crosscutting eclogite, in recrystallized garnet and epidote in gneiss; (2) CO2 ( CH4)-H2O inclusions (type II) which are present in both magmatic cores and metamorphic rims of zircon and are distributed along quartz fractures; (3) complex saline inclusions containing halite \u00b1 SiO2 \u00b1 CaCO3 which either occur as primary inclusions in omphacite of eclogite, coexisting with quartz rods and paralleling to the c-axis of omphacite, or distributed along intragranular fractures in diopside of garnet pyroxenite; (4) CO2 rich inclusions (type IV) which are distributed randomly in quartz of eclogite; and (5) monophase gas inclusions (type V) which occur randomly or along fractures of various minerals. The occurrence of fluid inclusions and their relative chronology suggest that the inclusions of types I and II occurred in the protoliths, in the peak- and retrograde stages of UHP metamorphic rocks but the type III was present primarily in the early decompression-retrogression stage of UHP rocks, whereas types IV and V were trapped mainly in the amphibolite-facies or later stages. This study gains the following unde rstanding: (1) The low-salinity H2O and CO2 fluids are present in all the prograde-, peak- and retrograde metamorphic stages, suggesting that the fluids were inherited during the entire UHP metamorphic evolution. (2) While fluid inclusions are abubdant in the protoliths of UHP rocks and in the amphibolite-facies rocks those trapped in the peak stage are rare, implying that abundant fluids contained in the protoliths were removed from the rock system or entered into UHP hydrous minerals or nominally anhydrous minerals. (3) The identification of primary inclusions with complex composition demonstrates that a melt-like fluid was present in the early decompression-retrograde stage after the peak UHP metamorphism and nominally anhydrous minerals might hold a significant amount of fluids under UHP conditions and released in retrograde process, resulting in fluid-rock interactions. (4) Fluid inclusions trapped in the amphibolite-facies stage have various compositions and they are concentrated locally and may partly derived from external fluids. (5) Great differences in type, abundance and composition of fluid inclusions exist in different lithologies and depths of the drill hole, suggesting that there was no large-scale pervasive fluid flow during UHP metamorphism. (6) The pressures obtained from the isochores of the fluid inclusions trapped during the peak of UHP metamorphism are mush less than the peak metamorphic pressures as derived from the mineral thermobarometers, indicating density changes of the fluid inclusions due to fluid leakage, partial decrepitation and fluid-rock interactions, etc.",

        "abstract": "Being one of the largest gold deposits in the Ailaoshan gold belt in Yunnan Province, the Daping gold mine occurred in a strongly mylonitized and sericitized Caledonian diorite batholith, and is a typical ductile shear zone-controlled gold deposit. 40Ar/39Ar dating was performed on hydrothermal sericite collected from mylonitized and sericitized diorite around rock of the Daping gold deposit, which yielded a set of age data, i. e., plateau age of 33.76\u00b10.65 Ma, inverse and normal isochronal ages of 33.55\u00b10.74 Ma and 33.57\u00b10.74 Ma, respectively. These age data are very similar to ages (33-34 Ma) of the lamprophyre dykes, which are extensively distributed in the Ailaoshan gold belt, suggesting that gold mineralization of the Daping mine was closely related to the Cenozoic lamprophyre dykes, which were generated by partial melting of the upper mantle. From early of the Cenozoic Era, upwelling of the Moho and partially melted upper mantle caused by crustal extension and strong ductile deformation resulted in formation and intrusion of large amounts of lamprophyre dykes. The mantle-derived fluids formed by the upper mantle degassing and the CO2,-riching fluids from the lower crust released by dehydration and roasting triggered by the rising hot mantle magma's heat mixed and migrated up along micro-fractures in the shear zone, and reacted with the mylonitized and sericitized diorite around rock, and finally deposited the ore minerals in the brittle structures of the shear zone because of water-rock interaction and boiling.",

        "abstract": "Laser Raman spectroscopy analyses found plentiful graphites solid inclusions with size of 1\uff5e5 \u03bcm in the auriferous quartz veins in Daping gold mine in Yunnan Province, China. For the sake of carrying out Daping graphite's function as an indicator of its host rock's forming condition and the source of the mineralizing fluid. the fluid inclusions in the graphite-bearing quartzes were investigated by laser raman spectroscopy and a cooling/heating stage in this work. The result showed that The fluid inclusions in the graphite-bearing quartzes were dominated by pure CO_2 inclusions and CO_2-enriched aqueous inclusions with a little of N_2 and without H_2, CH_4 and CO revealed. The laser raman spectra of all the graphite inclusions showed a sharp high intensity ordered \"O\" peak at 1576\uff5e1580cm~ -1 shift, but most of them didn't show a disordered \"D\" peak near 1355cm~ -1 shift , indicating that the graphites possess full-ordered structure and high crystallinity. Based on D\u2236O peak intensity ratios, these graphite inclusions formed at granulite-facies metamorphic temperature, which is much higher than the homogeneous temperature (300.0\uff5e420.0\u2103) of the CO_2-enriched fluid inclusions in the graphite-bearing quartzes. Types and composition of the fluid inclusions in the auriferous quartz veins confirmed that the graphite could not be precipitated directly from the ore-forming fluid. Therefore, it is suggested that the Daping graphites formed in the lower crust under granulite-facies metamorphic condition. The Ailaoshan ductile shear zone generated during Himalayan movement probably cut the crust quite deeply, and pumped a great deal of CO_2 enriched fluid, and simultaneously small grains of graphites, from the granulite-faceis metamorphic basement in the lower crust. The CO_2 enriched fluid carrying high-crystallized graphites ascended along the shear zone, and finally the graphites precipitated in the brittle faults in the diorite with plentiful ore minerals. The results in this study reconfirmed that the lower crust fluid played an important role in the mineralization of Daping mine.",

        "abstract": "Concentrations of platinum group elements (PGE) of ores and related rocks from Baimazhai Ni-Cu sulfide deposit were determined by using an ICP-MS with nickel sulfide fire assay pre-concentration. The results show that the total PGE (\u2211PGE) in the Baimazhai ores and the around rocks are quite low, which decreases gradually from central massive ores (78.15 \u00d7 10-9 \u223c 555.92 \u00d7 10-9) to the mineralized peridotite (6.77 \u00d7 10-9 \u223c 70.95 \u00d7 10-9) and gabbro (3.02 \u00d7 10-9). The lamprophyre dykes also show low \u2211PGE (6.86 \u00d7 10-9 \u223c 17.03 \u00d7 10-9). Besides, the \u2211PGE show obvious direct correlation with Ni contents. Primitive mantle normalized PGE patterns of various rocks and ores from Baimazhai mine are quite different, the massive ores possess Pt-Pd type with relatively Ir depleted patterns, while the mineralized peridotite show relatively flat with positive Ru patterns. The gabbro and lamprophyre dykes show nearly same PGE patterns with marked positive Ru anomaly. Cu/Pd ratios of the Baimazhai rocks and ores are greatly higher than that of the primitive mantle, implying that the parental magmas might have undergone strong sulfide segregation. (Pd+Pt)/(Os+Ir+Ru) and Pd/Ir ratios of the massive ores are 138.24 and 24.7, indicating that its parental magma is of gabbroic or basaltic and underwent exhaustively complete sulfide segregation. On the contrary, the corresponding ratios of the mineralized peridotite are 3.02 and 16.09 respectively, which are similar to those of komatiitic magma, implying that the massive ores has no genetic relationship with the mineralized peridotite. Before intrusion of the sulfide liquid of massive ores, its parental magma might have undergone long-term and strong sulfide segregation, and the sulfide liquid might have intruded into the core of the rock body No. 3 of the Baimazhai mine as an isolated intrusive phase. The PGE parameters of Baimazhai Ni-Cu deposit suggest that evolution and mineralization of the late part of the Emei mantle plume might have undergone highly S saturation, and crustal contamination might have played an role during mineralization of the Baimazhai deposit.",

        "abstract": "The Baimazhai deposit in Yunnan Province is one of the largest Cu\u2013Ni sulfide deposits hosted in mafic\u2013ultramafic intrusions in China. Concentrations of platinum-group elements (PGE) in massive sulfide ores and host rocks from Baimazhai were determined by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) following nickel sulfide fire assay pre-concentration. The results show that the total PGE (\u03a3PGE) are quite low, decreasing gradually from central massive ores (78.2\u2013556\u00a0ppb) to olivine pyroxenite (0.472\u201367.0\u00a0ppb), gabbro (0.847\u00a0ppb) and, websterite (0.76\u20130.809). The intruded lamprophyre dykes also show low \u03a3PGE (2.98\u20134.07\u00a0ppb). The \u03a3PGE exhibit obvious positive correlations with Au, Ni and Cu contents. Primitive mantle normalized PGE patterns of the massive Cu\u2013Ni ores are of the Pt\u2013Pd type with relatively steep and trough-like patterns, which are similar to those of the host rocks. In addition, the Pt/Pd and Cu/Pd ratios of the massive sulfide ores are similar to those of olivine pyroxenite, gabbro and websterite. These characteristics suggest that sulfides in the massive ores are of magmatic origin, co-genetic with their host rocks. The relatively high Pt/Pd ratios of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores (averaging 0.83) and their host rocks imply that the Baimazhai sulfides formed in a single sulfide saturation event, but not through multiple sulfide injections. High Ir contents (0.77\u20135.52\u00a0ppb, averaging 2.35\u00a0ppb) and dramatically variable Pd/Ir ratios (4.76\u2013296, averaging 138) of the massive sulfide ores suggest that the Baimazhai sulfide ores might have suffered significant late stage hydrothermal alteration. The Baimazhai massive sulfide ores yield a Re\u2013Os isochron age of 259 \u00b1 20\u00a0Ma (MSWD = 0.025), which is the same as the major eruption stage of the Emeishan large igneous province and the Baimazhai intrusion, further supporting their magmatic origin. The initial 187 Os/ 188 Os value of 0.456 \u00b1 0.026 indicates that crustal contamination has played an important role during mineralization. The proportion of crust-derived Os is calculated to be more than 30%. Keywords Platinum-group elements Re\u2013Os isotopic dating Massive sulfide ore Baimazhai Cu\u2013Ni deposit Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP) 1 Introduction Many magmatic Cu\u2013Ni\u2013PGE sulfide deposits are closely associated with mantle plumes, such as with the Bushveld in South Africa, Noril'sk in Russia, and Duluth Complex in North America ( Naldrett, 1981 ). The Emeishan basalt, located in the southwest Yangtze craton, is considered to have been derived from a Permian mantle plume ( Xu et al., 2001 ), associated with which numerous magmatic Cu\u2013Ni\u2013PGE sulfide deposits have been discovered, such as at Jinbaoshan, Yangliuping, Baimazhai, Limahe and Zhubu in southwest China and Ban Phuc in northern Vietnam. Among these deposits, the Baimazhai Cu\u2013Ni sulfide deposit is characterized by small concentric mafic\u2013ultramafic intrusions, high grade and large reserves of Ni and Cu, and quite low and variable PGE contents. Studies on the genesis of the Baimazhai deposit may provide clues also for the formation of other giant magmatic sulfide deposits hosted in small intrusions, such as the Jinchun and Hongqiling deposits in China ( Tang and Li, 1995; Tang, 1996; Wang et al., 2006, Wang and Zhou, 2006 ). Baimazhai in Yunnan Province hosts one of the largest magmatic Cu\u2013Ni sulfide deposits in China. Many researchers have investigated its geological and geochemical features, since its discovery in the 1950's ( Tang and Li, 1995; Tang, 1996; Huang et al., 2003; Song and Zhu, 2003; Song et al., 2003, 2005; Guan et al., 2003, 2004; Zhang et al., 2005a,b; Wang et al., 2006, Wang and Zhou, 2006; Zhang et al., 2006a,b ), but its genesis and ore-forming age are still in dispute. Tang and Li (1995) , Tang (1996) and Song et al. (2003) suggested that it formed through alternate injections of sulfide-rich and sulfide-poor melts formed by magmatic differentiation. Wang et al. (2006) , Wang and Zhou (2006) proposed that it formed when a Mg-rich magma became crustally contaminated in a deep-seated staging chamber. As for the formation age, many previous researchers speculated that the Baimazhai deposit was formed during the Hercynian Orogeny ( Tang and Li, 1995; Tang, 1996; Luo, 1995; Deng, 1999; Zhang et al., 2005a,b ). Wang et al. (2006) , Wang and Zhou (2006) proposed that the deposit formed in the Late Permian, based on a zircon U\u2013Pb age of 258.5 \u00b1 3.6\u00a0Ma for the gabbro in the Baimazhai intrusion. Nevertheless, there is no direct age for the massive sulfide ores. The platinum-group elements (PGE) and gold are highly siderophile and chalcophile elements, which can provide constraints on magmatic evolution and differentiation processes, complementary to those from lithophile elements. Moreover, the primitive mantle or chondrite-normalized patterns of PGE and gold are fairly resistant to hydrothermal alteration ( Barnes et al., 1985 ). Therefore, these elements have been commonly used in studies of the magmatic evolution of ultramafic to mafic magmas and related mineralization processes ( Naldrett and Duke, 1980, Naldrett, 1981, Naldrett et al., 2000; Barnes et al., 1985, Barnes and Naldrett, 1987, 1993; Lorand, 1989; Chai and Naldrett, 1992; Garuti et al., 1997; Zhang and Li, 1998; Jiang et al., 2000; Pasava et al., 2003, 2004; Maier et al., 1996, 2004; Wang et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2006a,b ). In this study, PGE and Au contents of massive ores and major host rocks from the Baimazhai deposit were determined by using induction coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and the ore-forming age of the massive ores was determined by the Re\u2013Os dating method. 2 Geological setting of the Baimazhai Ore deposit The Baimazhai Ni\u2013Cu deposit is hosted by the Jinping mafic\u2013ultramafic intrusion, which is located at the southern margin of the Ailaoshan metamorphic belt and near the southern edge of the Late Permian Emeishan large igneous province ( Fig. 1 ). The mining district is underlain by Lower Ordovician siltstone and shale, which are intruded by a series of NW-trending mafic to ultramafic, layered sill-like intrusions, extending for about 20\u00a0km along strike. A thick (about 4500\u00a0m) succession of flood basalts, which belong to the Emeishan large igneous province, is located about 10\u00a0km to the east of this mafic\u2013ultramafic sill zone. These two units are separated by a high-angle normal fault. The Baimazhai Ni\u2013Cu sulfide deposit is hosted by three mafic to ultramafic intrusions, named No. I, II and III ( Fig. 2 ). The No. III intrusion hosts most of the Baimazhai ores, and thus is the most important exploration and research target in this area. It is hook-shaped, trends 296\u00b0 and dips 22 to 23\u00b0, with a length of greater than 530\u00a0m and an average width of about 190\u00a0m. It consists of a mafic margin with a core of ultramafic rocks. From the margins to the core, rock types vary from gabbro, websterite to olivine pyroxenite, which are locally cut by Cenozoic (32.01 \u00b1 0.60\u00a0Ma to 32.46 \u00b1 0.62\u00a0Ma) lamprophyre dykes ( Fig. 3 ) ( Guan et al., 2003 ). The Baimazhai ore deposit consists of eight ore bodies, including six primary sulfide ores and two oxidized ones. Among these, the Nos. 1 and 2 bodies are the largest, hosting 97% of the total ore reserve, while Nos. 1 and 3 bodies are the richest, usually containing more than 3% Ni. The No. 1 ore body is located in the center of the No. III intrusion, nearly conformable with the compositional layering of the intrusion. The dominant metallic minerals include pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite and violarite with trace amounts of magnetite, ilmenite and chrome spinel. At nearby Jinbaoshan is a large scale magmatic sulfide Pt\u2013Pd deposit, located at the southern-most margin of the Ailaoshan metamorphic belt ( Fig. 1 ). There are 21 mafic and 11 ultramafic sills intruded into Devonian and Lower Permian strata in the Jinbaoshan area. Mafic sills consist mainly of gabbro, diabase and pyroxene diorite, whereas ultramafic sills are mainly composed of wehrlite, olivine clinopyroxenite and clinopyroxenite. The major mineralized intrusion, the Jinbaoshan intrusion, consists mainly of wehrlite, with a small amount of olivine clinopyroxenite and clinopyroxenite. The intrusion strikes NE and dips 10 to 45\u00b0NW, is 4760\u00a0m long, 760 to 1240\u00a0m wide, and 8 to 170\u00a0m thick. The Pd and Pt reserve of this deposit is 42\u00a0tons, and the average grade of Pd + Pt are 1.77\u00a0ppm, ranging from 0.5 to 5.5\u00a0ppm and up to 13.8\u00a0ppm ( Wang et al., 2005 ). At Yangliuping is another Ni\u2013Cu\u2013PGE sulfide deposit, located in western Sichuan Province and in the northern part of the western region of the ELIP ( Fig. 1 ). There four mineralized mafic bodies were intruded into Devonian carbonaceous marble and graphitic schist. The intrusions are 200 to 300\u00a0m thick and 1000 to 2000\u00a0m length, consisting mainly of serpentinite, talc schist, tremolite schist, and meta-gabbro. Disseminated Ni\u2013Cu sulfides occur mainly in the serpentinite in the lower parts of the intrusions, and massive sulfides mainly occur beneath the mineralized serpentinite at the base of the intrusions and in the footwall along fractures. Disseminated sulfide ores have average grades of 0.24\u20131.16\u00a0wt.% Ni, 0.08\u20130.44\u00a0wt.% Cu and 0.22\u20131.54\u00a0ppm PGE, whereas massive ores contain 1.2\u20134.18\u00a0wt.% Ni, 0.54\u20130.67\u00a0wt.%, and 1.75\u20133.53\u00a0ppm PGE ( Song et al., 2003 ). 3 Samples, analytical methods and results 3.1 Samples Samples for this study, including massive sulfide ores, olivine pyroxenite, websterite, gabbro and younger Cenozoic lamprophyre dykes, were collected mainly from underground tunnels and diamond drill cores at position CK3 of the 9 + 25 exploration line into the No. III intrusion. The massive sulfide ores collected from the center of the No. III intrusion are composed mainly of pyrrhotite (50\u201370%), chalcopyrite (10\u201320%), pentlandite (5\u201315%) and magnetite (5\u201310%), with typical euhedral to subhedral textures. The gabbro is fairly fresh with slight hydrothermal alteration. It consists mainly of tremolite, albite, quartz plus minor amount of apatite and sulfides. The websterite originally consisted mainly of clinopyroxene (50%), orthopyroxene (50%) and trace amount of plagioclase, which have been mostly replaced by tremolite, cummingtonite and albite, respectively, due to hydrothermal alteration. The olivine pyroxenites are more intensely altered than the other rocks. Olivine and pyroxene have been replaced by clinochlore, talc and penninite. The pyroxenites also consist of carbonate minerals, phlogopite, tremolite, biotite, magnetite, sulfides and sphene. The Cenozoic lamprophyre dykes are mainly minettes and lamprophyres, and consist predominantly of phlogopite and pyroxene phenocrysts in a potassium feldspar, biotite, phlogopite and plagioclase matrix. Geochemical studies reveal that the lamprophyres cutting the Baimazhai intrusions are derived from a LREE-enriched, metasomatized mantle ( Guan et al., 2004 ). 3.2 Major and trace element analyses Major elements and CO 2 contents of the Baimazhai intrusions were determined by wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WD-XRFS) in The National Research Center of Geoanalysis, Chinese Academy of Geosciences (CAG). The accuracy of the WD-XRFS analyses is about \u00b1 2%. The standards used are GB/T14506.28-1993 and GB9835-1988. Cu and Ni were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) at Sun Yat-sen University, while lithophile trace elements and rare earth elements were analysed by using a Perkin-Elmer ELAN9000 ICP-MS in the State Key Laboratory of Mineral Deposit Research at Nanjing University. Major and trace element compositions of major host rocks of the Baimazhai sulfide ores are presented in Table 1 . 3.3 PGE and Au analyses The PGE and Au contents of the massive sulfide ores were determined in The National Research Center of Geoanalysis, CAG by using NiS-fire assay pre-concentration followed by ICP-MS measurement. Host rocks were analysed in the Key Laboratory of Isotope Geochronology and Geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, The Chinese Academy of Sciences using a modified NiS-fire assay method ( Sun and Sun, 2005 ). The samples were mixed with sodium carbonate, sodium borate, borax, glass powder, nickel powder, iron powder, sulfur and wheat flour. The mixture was transferred into a fire-clay crucible, an appropriate amount of 190 Os spike solution was added and the mixture was covered with a thin layer of Na 2 B 4 O 7 . After fusing at 1150\u00a0\u00b0C for ~ 1\u00a0h and drying under an infrared lamp, the crucible was cooled and broken, and the Ni-Fe button was removed. The button was then placed in a glass beaker containing 60\u00a0mL H 2 O for a minimum of 10\u00a0h. To better dissolve the button, about 30\u00a0mL HCl was added and the beaker was heated at ~ 110\u00a0\u00b0C for ~ 30\u00a0min, until the solution became clear and little residue remained. The solution was then filtered using a milli-pore filter membrane (diameter 25\u00a0mm, 0.45\u00a0mm), the residue was collected and then washed 5 times with ~ 15\u00a0mL water. The residue together with the membrane was transferred into a 7\u00a0mL Teflon beaker, sealed together with 1\u00a0mL HCl + 1\u00a0mL H 2 O 2 , and heated at ~ 110\u00a0\u00b0C for 1.5\u00a0h. After cooling to room temperature, the beaker was opened and the solution was transferred and diluted with H 2 O to a total volume of 10\u00a0mL in preparation for ICP-MS analysis ( Sun et al., 1998a,b, 2001; Sun and Sun, 2005 ). The precision of analysis is better than 5% for Rh, Pd and Ir, and 10% for other elements. The detection limit is 0.2\u00a0ng/g for Pt, Pd and Au; 0.001\u00a0ng/g for Ir, Rh and Os; 0.1\u00a0ng/g for Ru. The standards used during the analyses are national geostandards of China, GDP-3 and GDP-4, and the PGE concentrations determined during this study, together with recommended values of these standards are listed in Table 2 . Analytical data for PGE, Au, Cu and Ni concentrations in the massive sulfide ores and major host rocks from the Baimazhai deposits are presented in Table 3 and in an Online Table 1A . 3.4 Re\u2013Os dating Re\u2013Os isotopic analyses were performed in the National Research Center of Geoanalysis, CAG, using a Carius tube (a thick-walled borosilicate glass ampoule) digestion technique. The weighed sample was loaded into a Carius tube through a long, thin-neck funnel. Then, a mixed 190 Os\u2013 185 Re spike solution together with 4\u00a0ml of 10\u00a0N HCl and 4\u00a0ml of 16\u00a0N HNO 3 was added while the bottom of the tube was frozen at \u2212 80 to \u2212 50\u00a0\u00b0C in an ethanol\u2013liquid nitrogen slush. The top of the Carius tube was then sealed using an oxygen\u2013propane torch, and the tube was placed in a stainless-steel jacket and heated at 230\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h. After cooling, the bottom of the tube was frozen, the neck of the tube was broken, and the contents of the tube, including the residue washed out with 40\u00a0ml of water, were poured into a distillation flask. Separation of Os by distillation and separation of Re by extraction were performed using the analytical method described earlier ( Du et al., 1994, 1995, 2001, 2004 ). A TJA PQ-EXCELL ICP-MS was used to determine the Re and Os isotope ratios. Selected isotopes for the measurement of Re were 185 Re and 187 Re. Sometimes a Re-bearing solution contained a small amount of incompletely separated 187 Os, which would contribute to the 187 Re peak; accordingly, 190 Os was selected as the monitor for 187 Os. Selected isotopes for the measurement of Os were 187 Os, 190 Os and 192 Os. Sometimes the OsO 4 trap solution contained a small amount of unseparated 187 Re, which would thus contribute to the 187 Os peak; accordingly, 185 Re was selected as the monitor for 187 Re. Average blanks for the total Carius tube procedure were ca. 10\u00a0pg for Re and ca. 1\u00a0pg for Os. The analytical reliability was tested by repeated analyses of molybdenite standard, HLP-5, from a carbonatite vein-type molybdenum-lead deposit in the Jinduicheng\u2013Huanglongpu area of Shaanxi Province, China ( Stein et al., 1997 ). The uncertainty in each individual age determination was about 0.35%, including the uncertainty of the decay constant of 187 Re, uncertainty in isotope ratio measurement, and spike calibrations. Median age of HLP-5 during the analyses was 221.34 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0Ma, which is identical to the recommended value of 221.3 \u00b1 0.3\u00a0Ma (95% confidence limit, Stein et al., 1997 ). The average Re concentration was 283.71 \u00b1 1.54\u00a0mg/g, and the average Os concentration was 657.95 \u00b1 4.74\u00a0ng/g. The details of the chemical procedure have been described by Du et al. (1995, 2001) . The concentrations of Re and Os and the osmium isotopic compositions of 5 samples of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores are presented in Table 4 ( Shi et al., 2006 ). The total Re concentrations are 8.6 to 116.9\u00a0ng/g. The common Os are corrected according to the Nier value. 4 Discussions 4.1 Major and trace elements For the olivine pyroxenites, SiO 2 and MgO are strongly depleted in altered or mineralized samples, while FeO and CO 2 are considerably enriched. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores and major host rocks are presented in Fig. 4 . Remarkably, the massive ores and their host rocks possess similar REE patterns, e.g., LREE enrichment and negative Eu anomalies, consistent with previous results ( Wang et al., 2006 ), suggesting that the sulfide ores may have a similar origin to their host rocks. 4.2 PGE geochemistry The total PGE contents (\u03a3PGE) of the Baimazhai samples are quite low and greatly varied, ranging from 78.2\u00a0ppb to 556\u00a0ppb for the massive ores, much lower than those of the Jinbaoshan deposit (1822\u00a0ppb to 11,379\u00a0ppb, Wang et al., 2006 ) and the Yangliuping (3599\u00a0ppb, Song et al., 2003 ). \u03a3PGE are 0.472\u00a0ppb to 67.0\u00a0ppb for the olivine pyroxenite, 0.847\u00a0ppb for the gabbro, 0.76\u00a0ppb to 0.809\u00a0ppb for the websterite, and 2.98\u00a0ppb to 4.07\u00a0ppb for the lamprophyre dykes, which are also much lower than those of ultramafic intrusions of the Jinbaoshan deposit (17.6\u00a0ppb to 190\u00a0ppb, Tao et al., 2004a; Wang et al., 2006 ). In the drill core, the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores have much higher \u03a3PGE, Au, Cu and Ni contents than their host rocks ( Fig. 5 ). \u03a3PGE of both ores and host rocks from the Baimazhai deposit show obvious positive correlations with Au, Ni and Cu contents ( Fig. 6 ). Primitive mantle normalized chalcophile element (PGE + Au + Cu + Ni) patterns of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores and their silicate host rocks are all of the Pt\u2013Pd type deposit with relatively steep and trough-like patterns ( Fig. 7 ), suggesting that they may be co-genetic. As previously proposed ( Wang and Zhou., 2006 ), the relatively high Pt/Pd ratios of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores (averaging 0.83) and their host rocks imply that the Baimazhai sulfides formed in a single sulfide saturation event. In addition, the Pt/Pd and Cu/Pd ratios of the massive sulfide ores are 0.39\u20131.11 and 49,100\u2013456,000, respectively, which are similar to those of the olivine pyroxenite (0.6\u20131.8 and 55,100\u20131,240,000), gabbro (0.6 and 230,000) and websterite (0.72\u20131.2 and 482,000\u20131,300,000), which also suggests that the sulfides in the massive ores may be cogenetic with their host rocks. The Pd/Ir ratios of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores are highly variable, ranging from 4.76 to 296 ( Fig. 8 ), with an average of 138, and their Ir contents are relatively high, varying between 0.77\u20135.52\u00a0ppb, with an average of 2.35\u00a0ppb. The Pd/Ir ratio is generally used as an indicator of the genesis of sulfide ores. Magmatic sulfides ores have relatively low Pd/Ir ratio, while hydrothermal sulfide ores have high Pd/Ir ratios ( Keays et al., 1982; Keays, 1995 ) because of the different geochemical behavior of Pd and Ir in magmas and hydrothermal fluids ( Barnes et al., 1985 ). In general, Ir is not easily transported by hydrothermal fluids, and so hydrothermal sulfide ores have very low Ir contents and high Pd/Ir ratios ( Keays et al., 1982 ). For example, hydrothermal sulfides collected from submarine black smokers of the PACMANUS hydrothermal field, Papua New Guinea, have low Ir content (0.7\u20130.8\u00a0ppb at average) and high Pd/Ir ratio (12.4\u2013231.9) ( Pasava et al., 2004 ). Therefore, the high Ir contents of the Baimazhai ores support a magmatic origin for the deposit, while the highly variable Pd/Ir ratios point to strong late stage hydrothermal alteration. On a Ni/Cu vs. Pd/Ir diagram ( Fig. 8 ), all of the Baimazhai sulfide ores and their silicate host rocks plot in the high-MgO basaltic and layered intrusion fields, supporting our contention that the source of the Baimazhai Cu\u2013Ni sulfide ores is high-MgO basalts. Cu/Pd ratios of the Baimazhai samples are quite high, ranging from 491,00 to 456,000 with an average of 145,000 in the massive sulfide ores, 55,000 to 1,240,000 with an average of 501,000 in the olivine pyroxenite, 230,000 in the gabbro, and 482,000 to 1,300,000 with an average of 890,000 in the websterite ( Online Table 1A ). All of these Cu/Pd ratios are considerably higher than the primitive mantle value of 6500. They are also systematically higher than that of Jinchuan (Cu/Pd = 50,000, Wang et al., 2004 ), the largest Cu\u2013Ni sulfide deposit in China, and that of the basalts from the Emeishan large igneous province ( Zhong et al., 2006 ). The Cu/Pd ratio is commonly used to study magmatic Cu\u2013Ni sulfide deposits (Barnes, 1993; Maier et al., 1996 ) because the partition coefficient of Pd between sulfide and silicate magma is about 17,000 ( Fleet et al., 1996 ), which is much higher than that of Cu (about 1383). Thus Pd is highly concentrated in the sulfides. During generation and evolution of the magma, if S-unsaturated, the sulfides cannot be segregated from the magma, and the Pd will be concentrated in sulfide droplets and make the magma more enriched in Pd than Cu, with a Cu/Pd ratio lower than the primitive mantle. In contrast, if the magma is S-saturated, the subsequent sulfide segregation will remove most of the Pd from the magma, resulting in a higher Cu/Pd ratio in the residual magma than in the primitive mantle. Thus, the high Cu/Pd ratios of the Baimzahai sulfide ores suggest that their source magma might have undergone sulfide segregation at an early stage of crystallation. Previous geochemical calculations have shown that the S contents in the source region of the Emeishan large igneous province were very low, which was interpreted to indicate that in its early stage, the parent magma, generated by partial melting, was S-unsaturated ( Zhang et al., 2005a,b ). We propose that the low S contents in the Emeishan large igneous province are due to early S saturation, probably in a deep magma chamber because of the lower S solubility at depth ( Mavrogenes & O'Neill, 1999 ). The Baimazhai massive sulfide deposit formed through a series of geological processes, including the addition of external S, mostly due to the involvement of sulfide-bearing sediments, as well as a decline of temperature that caused the parent magma of the Baimazhai silicate intrusions to become gradually S-saturated. In a Pt/Y vs. Pd \u00d7 1000/Cr diagram ( Fig. 9 ), the Baimazhai silicate intrusive rocks, especially the gabbro and websterite, plot at low Pt/Y and Pd/Cr ratios. By contrast, massive sulfide ore has much higher Pt/Y and Pd/Cr ratios. During fractional crystallization of S-undersaturated magmas, Cr is compatible and so is removed from the magma in the early crystallization stage, whereas Pd is highly incompatible under such condition ( Keays, 1995 ). Meanwhile, Pt is moderately compatible and Y is highly incompatible in chromite ( Peck and Keays, 1990 ). Thus Pd/Cr ratios will increase with fractionation of S-undersaturated magmas, while Pt/Y will decrease slightly or remain unchanged, if chromite is not a fractionating phase ( Wang and Zhou, 2006 ). In addition, Pt and Pd have much higher sulfide/silicate partition coefficients than those of Ni and Cu, thus Pt and Pd can be extensively removed from the magmas by segregating sulfides. Thus, if sulfides were segregated from the magmas, Pd/Cr and Pt/Y ratios will decrease significantly in the residual magmas. The low Pd/Cr and Pt/Y ratios indicate that the Baimazhai rocks may have crystallized from residual magmas after immiscible sulfide segregation, which formed the massive sulfide ores with high Pd/Cr and Pt/Y ratios ( Fig. 9 ). 4.3 Re\u2013Os dating 4.3.1 Age of mineralization The Baimazhai samples yield a Re\u2013Os isochron age of 259 \u00b1 20\u00a0Ma (2 \u03c3 ), with an initial 187 Os/ 188 Os of 0.456 \u00b1 0.026 and MSWD of 0.025, calculated using the ISOPLOT software (version 2.49a) ( Fig. 10 ). This age is interpreted to be time of formation of the Cu\u2013Ni sulfides in the Baimazhai deposit. Many previous researchers speculated that the Baimazhai mafic\u2013ultramafic intrusion was formed during the Hercynian Orogeny ( Tang and Li, 1995; Tang, 1996; Luo, 1995; Deng, 1999; Zhang et al., 2005a,b ). Wang et al. (2006) reported a zircon SHRIMP U\u2013Pb age of 258 \u00b13.6\u00a0Ma for the Baimazhai gabbro, and proposed that it represents the crystallization age of the Baimazhai intrusion. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of 160 to 170\u00a0Ma for the Baimazhai intrusion were interpreted as late stage hydrothermal redistribution and structural deformation events ( Zhang et al., 2006a,b ). The Re\u2013Os age obtained in this study is the first obtained on the Baimazhai sulfide ores. It suggests that the Baimazhai Cu\u2013Ni deposit was formed in the Late Permian, very close to the time of major eruption of the Emeishan large igneous province ( Zhou et al., 2002; Tao et al., 2004a,b; Ali et al., 2005 ) and also is consistent with the U\u2013Pb age of the Baimazhai gabbro ( Wang et al., 2006 ), and the age of the Yangliuping intrusion ( Song and Zhu, 2003; Song et al., 2005 ), but much later than those of the Jinbaoshan (304 to 322\u00a0Ma) and Yuanmou (328 to 418\u00a0Ma) ( Deng, 1999 ) intrusions. The age supports the interpretation that the massive sulfide ores are of magmatic origin, and cogenetic with host intrusions. The combined geochronology also implies that the magmatic sulfide deposits in the Emeishan mantle plume did not form in a single stage. In the Ailaoshan metamorphic belt, the mafic\u2013ultramafic intrusions and their hosted magmatic sulfide deposits became younger from northwest to southeast. 4.3.2 Crustal contamination Most of the previous researchers thought that the Baimazhai deposit was formed by multiple injections from a deep-seated magma chamber, and the ore-forming materials were derived predominantly from the mantle ( Luo, 1995; Deng, 1999 ). This is not supported by our Re\u2013Os data. The Re\u2013Os isotopic system is a highly sensitive indicator of crustal contamination during the formation of magmatic sulfide deposits ( Foster et al., 1996; Mathur et al., 1999; Trista-Aguilera et al., 2006 ). The upwelling of mafic\u2013ultramafic magma and its reaction with crustal rocks, especially the sulfide-bearing sediments, will change chemical compositions and the evolution of the magma chamber. Because crustal material is much more enriched in Re than the mantle ( Hauri & Hart, 1997; Sun et al., 2003a,b ), the more crustal rocks that is involved, the higher the radiogenic 187 Os concentrations and the corresponding initial 187 Os/ 188 Os ( Shirey and Walker, 1998; Mao and Du, 2002 ). The 187 Os/ 188 Os of the crust (0.2\u201310) ( Shirey and Walker, 1998 ) is much higher than that of the mantle (0.11\u20130.15, Meisel et al., 1996; Sun et al., 1998a,b; Shirey and Walker, 1998 ), thus it is easy to discern these two different sources of Os. The initial 187 Os/ 188 Os ratio from the Baimazhai massive ores is 0.456 \u00b1 0.026 ( Fig. 10 ), which is considerably higher than the chondritic or the mantle 187 Os/ 188 Os ratio at 259\u00a0Ma ( Walker et al., 1994, 1997; Shirey and Walker, 1998 ), indicating that crustal components were involved in the Os source of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores. In order to better understand the Os isotopic composition in a given time, Walker et al. (1989, 1994) introduced a parameter of g Os . \u03b3 O s ( t ) = 100 [ O 187 s / O 188 s ] sample ( t ) / ( O 187 s / O 188 s ) chondrite ( t ) \u2212 1] . \u03b3 Os value is positive for a magmatic system with crustal components, because of the higher Re/Os ratio of the crust. On the contrary, Re-loss from a chondritic reservoir will result in a negative \u03b3 Os value ( Walker et al., 1994 ). The \u03b3 Os ( t ) value has been used to estimate the amount of crustal material in ores, e.g., the Keivitsa Ni\u2013PGE sulfide in Finland, with \u03b3 Os ( t ) = + 130 \u2212 + 173, represents about 28% crustal contamination ( Ripley et al., 1999 ), and Babbiff massive sulfide ores in USA, with \u03b3 Os ( t ) + 500 \u2212 + 1200, represents about 35% crustal contamination ( Hanski et al., 1997 ). The calculated \u03b3 Os ( t ) of the Baimazhai massive ores is + 263, and lies between that of these two deposits, suggesting that considerable crustal material has been added. Assuming that the parent magma of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores assimilated normal continental crust, more than 50% of crustal material is needed to explain the Os data of the gabbro and other rocks associated with the ore deposit. Bulk assimilation of average crustal material, however, will also dramatically increase the SiO 2 content of the magma, which is not appreciated. Given that sulfur solubility increases with decreasing pressure ( Mavrogenes and O'Neill, 1999 ), S saturation in an ascending magma chamber requires the addition of S. Assuming that the parent magma has assimilated S-rich materials in the crust with an Os concentration and 187 Os/ 188 Os considerably higher than normal crust, then perhaps less than 30% of crustal material is needed ( Fig. 11 ). On a common Os vs. Re/Os diagram ( Fig. 12 ), the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores plot in the fields of mantle derived melts and S-rich sediments, also suggesting that sulfide-bearing sediments might have been added during the formation of the massive ores. Besides, preliminary analyses show that the \u03b4 34 S of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores range from 5.3 to 11.1\u2030, much higher than the mantle values, again suggesting that sulfide-bearing sediments were added. The Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian strata in the Jinping area are composed mainly of sulfide-bearing marine sediments, such as siltstone and shale, which can provide large amounts of S to the intruded magma by assimilation. Involvement of the sulfide-bearing sediments will drive the parent magma of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores to S saturation, and promote the formation and segregation of large amounts of sulfides. Thus, it is very likely that crustal contamination played a key role during the formation of the Baimazhai Cu\u2013Ni deposit. 5 Conclusions Similar chondrite-normalized REE patterns, primitive mantle normalized PGE patterns, and Pt/Pd and Cu/Pd ratios of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores and their silicate host rocks suggest that they are cogenetic. High Pt/Pd ratios indicate they may have formed in a single sulfide saturation event, instead of multiple injections. Low Pd/Cr and Pt/Y ratios of the Baimazhai intrusions suggest they may be the residual magmas after segregation of the massive sulfide ores with high Pd/Cr and Pt/Y ratios. High Ir contents and highly variable Pd/Ir ratios of the Baimazhai sulfide ores imply that they were formed by magmatic process, but have also suffered strong late stage hydrothermal alteration. A Re\u2013Os isochron age of the massive ores is 259 \u00b1 20\u00a0Ma, with an initial 187 Os/ 188 Os value of 0.456 \u00b1 0.026, and a corresponding \u03b3 Os ( t ) of + 263, suggesting that the ore-forming age of the Baimazhai Cu\u2013Ni deposit was very close to the time of major eruption of the Emeishan large igneous province and the Baimazhai intrusions. The ore-forming material derived both from the mantle and the crust, and the crust-derived Os is estimated to be more than 30%. Involvement of sulfide-bearing sediments could have significantly increased sulfur content, resulting in S saturation and sulfide segregation, and consequently the formation of the massive sulfide deposits. Therefore, crustal contamination is proposed to have played a key role during the formation of the Baimazhai Cu\u2013Ni deposit.

        "abstract": "Bangbu gold deposit is located to the south of the east section of the Yarlung Zangbo tectonic suture zone in the southern Tibet. The gold orc bodies are controlled by the secondary fractures in the large-scale brittle-ductile shear zone. It is a proved large-scale primary gold deposit in Tibet. Microthermometric measurements and Laser Raman analysis show that auriferous quartz veins of the Bangbu gold deposit contain three types of fluid inclusions: liquid aqueous inclusions (type I) : CO2-bearing brine inclusions (type II), which can be subdivided into two-phase (type Ha) and three-phase (type lib) inclusions: pure gaseous hydrocarbon inclusions (type III). The CO2-bearing brine inclusions have salinity values of 2. 20% NaCl eqv \u223c9. 45% NaCleqv, with a peak of 6.0% NaCl eqv \u223c7.0% NaCleqv and an average of 6.25% NaCl eqv, homogenization temperature values of 166.7 \u223c 335. 8\u00b0C, with a peak of 210 \u223c 250\u00b0C and an average of 235. 4\u00b0C, and density values of 0.63 \u223c 0. 96g/cm3, with a peak of 0. 85 \u223c 0. 95g/cm3 and an average of 0. 87g/cm3, suggesting that the ore-forming fluids of the Bangbu gold deposit is characteristics by high content of CO2, low salinity, low to moderate homogenization temperature and low density, which are similar to those of typical orogenic gold deposits. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic analyses show that \u03b4D and \u03b418O of the ore-forming fluids in the Bangbu gold deposit are-44. 4% \u223c-105. 3% and 4.7% \u223c 9.0%, respectively, indicating that the ore-forming fluids is composed mainly of metamorphic fluid, with addition oi mantle-derived fluid Geologic and geochemical features show that the Bangbu gold deposit may be a Cenozoic orogenic gold deposit formed under continental collisional background.",

        "title": "Co2-rich fluid inclusions in auriferous quartz veins from the Daping ductile shear zone hosted gold deposit in Yunnan Province, China, and its implications for gold mineralization",
        "abstract": "Mineralization epochs of the Daping gold deposits are divided into three stages: the early stage or scheelite-bearing quartz vein stage, the major stage or massive polymetallic sulphide typed auriferous quartz vein stage and the late stage or carbonate-quartz stage. Fluid inclusions in the various ore veins were studied by using a cooling/ heating stage and a Laser Raman spectroscopy, and the results show that the fluid inclusions are dominated by liquid CO2 inclusions and CO2-H2O inclusions with variable ratios of CO2/H2O. A lot of gaseous CO2-rich inclusions are found in the early stage scheelite-bearing quartz veins, liquid CO2 inclusions are dominanted in the major stage auriferous massive polymetallic sulphide ores, and aqueous inclusions are found only in the late stage carbonate-quartz veins. The gaseous phases in the fluid inclusions are nearly pure CO2, with a little N2 at the early stage. CO2-H2O inclusions in the early stage have salinity of 6.37%-14.64%NaCl with a peak of 9%-10.5%NaCl, homogenization temperature of 299.4-423. 7\u00b0C with a peak of 320-380\u00b0C entrapped pressure of about 190-440MPa, and CO2 inclusions density of 0.352-0.798g/cm3 with a majority of 0.64-0.71g/cm3. CO2-H2 O inclusions in the major mineralizing stage possess salinity of 3. 70% - 14. 64% NaCl with a mode of 7. 2% - 9. 0% NaCl, homogenization temperature of 279. 0-406. 5\u00b0C with a mode of 320-360\u00b0C, entrapped pressure of 133. 5 -340. OMPa with corresponding metallogenic depth of about 5.1-12.9km, and CO2 inclusions density of 0.591-0.843g/cm3. The fluid inclusion characteristics indicate that the ore-forming fluid of the Daping mine is a nearly critical CO2-H2 O-NaCl system with high-CO2 content (CO2 \u2265, H2 O) and low to moderate salinity. Boiling or phase separation without fluid mixing might has occurred during gold mineralization. The Daping mine is a ductile shear zone controlled mesothermal deposit, which was formed by rapid decompression and subsequent boiling and deposition. Combined with other evidences, it is believed that the ore-forming fluid in the Daping gold deposit was a mixture of mantle-derived fluid and the lower crust-sourced CO2-rich fluids. The gold was probably transported by [HS] complexes in the CO2-rich fluid, and the auriferous sulfides deposition was probably caused by phase separation.",

        "title": "Geochemistry of ore forming fluid and metallogenic mechanism of Axi low-sulfidation gold deposit in Xinjiang, China",
        "abstract": "Axi gold deposit is an adularia-sericite (high-sulfidation) type epithermal gold deposit hosted in Lower Carboniferous andesitic volcanic rocks and pyroclastics in western Tianshan, Xinjiang. The ore bodies occur in vein form, and are strictly controlled by the circular faults of palaeocaldera margin. The mineralization can be divided into five main stages, that are quartz-chalcedony vein stage, quartz vein stage, quartz-carbonate vein stage, sulfide vein stage and carbonate vein stage, and two types of ore are formed, including quartz vein and altered rock. The main ore minerals are native gold, pyrite, marcasite, arsenopyrite and gange minerals include quartz, chalcedony, siderite, calcite, sericite, adularia, etc. There three types of fluid inclusions formed in major mineralization stages were recognized: I liquid aqueous inclusion; II liquid-rich two-phase fluid inclusion; and III gas-rich fluid inclusion. The former two predominate. The ice melting temperatures of fluid inclusions range from - 0.3 -2.3\u00b0C, the corresponding salinities are 0.48%-3.75% NaCleq, averaging 1.85% NaCleq, and the peak ice melting temperatures range from -0.4 -1.6\u00b0C, the corresponding salinities are 0.66%-2.63% NaCleq. The range varies from 121-335\u00b0C, averaging 209\u00b0C, and the peak temperatures range from 140-290\u00b0C. Based on the the salinities and homogenization temperatures, we measured the fluid density is 0.73-0.96, and the ore-forming depth is less than 700 m. The ore-forming fluid has a narrow range of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition, \u03b4DH20,SMOW = -98\u2030 - -116\u2030, \u03b418OH2O,SMOW = -0.55\u2030-1.65\u2030, and the carbon isotope \u03b413 Ccalcite.PDB = 2.6\u2030-4.9\u2030, the sulfur isotope \u03b434SCDT = -4.0\u2030-3.1\u2030 (average -0.45\u2030). It is indicated by the stable isotope data that ore fluids come mainly from circulating meteoric water, the ore solutes are mainly from volcanic rocks hosting the deposit and basement rocks. Appearance of adularias and bladed quartz and sulfides aggregates and coexisting type I, type II and type III inclusions with greatly varied of vapor/liquid rations and homogenization temperatures suggest that boiling is the main factor causing the deposition of ore solutes. While for altered rock type ores, waterrock interaction may be major cause for ore solutes precipitation. The ore-forming fluid was close to neutral pH during major mineralization stages.",

        "title": "Ore-forming fluid geochemistry and metallogenic mechanism from Mazhala gold-antimony deposit in southern Tibet, China",
        "abstract": "The Mazhala Deposit is the most representative gold-antimony deposit in the gold-antimony ore-forming belt in southern Tibet, China. Microscopic observation and microthermometric study were performed on fluid inclusions hosted in gold-bearing mineral (stibnite and quartz), in order to directly characterize the physicochemical conditions of ore-forming fluid and investigate the genetic type of the deposit, source of ore-forming fluids and metallogenic mechanism of Mazhala antimony-gold Deposit. The results of microscopic observation show that the fluid inclusions hosted in stibnite and quartz are nearly the same and can be divided into four types: i-e. two-phase aqueous, three-phase CO2-H2O, pure CO2 and pure H 2O inclusions, respectively. Infrared microthermometric study show that the homogenization temperature (Th) values of the fluid inclusions hosted in stibnite peak at 180-210\u00b0C, the salinity values peak at 2. 5 \u223c3. 4% NaCleqv, and density values peak at 0. 895 \u223c0. 915g/cm 3, and that the Th, salinity and density of the fluid inclusions hosted in quartz show triple peaks at 270-300\u00b0C:, 225-255\u00b0C: and 180-210\u00b0C:, 4. 3% \u223c4. 9%NaCleqv, 3. 4% \u223c4. 0% NaCleqv and 2. 8% \u223c3. 4% NaCleqv, and the 0. 895 \u223c0. 915g/cm3, 0. 835 \u223c0. 855g/cm3 and 0. 775 \u223c0. 795g/cm3, respectively. Comparison of the microthermometric measurements shows that the Th, salinity and density of the fluid inclusions hosted in stibnite match with the lower T h and salinity and higher density values of inclusion hosted in the late stage of quartz, indicating that quartz was deposited from the ore-forming fluid before stibnite, also suggesting the input of low temperature and low salinity while high density fluids during stibnite precipitation. The \u03b45DH2o of the fluid inclusions hosted in stibnite and quartz is -68. 1%o \u223c-108%o, and their \u03b4OH2o is -2. 2%o \u223c12. 2%o, projected near metamorphic fields in the \u03b4D-\u03b418 O diagram, occasionally near meteoric line, indicating that ore-forming fluid is the mixture of metamorphic and meteoric waters. The \u03b413 C of fluid inclusion hosted in quartz is - 2. 9%o \u223c-3. 5%o, with an average of -3. 1%o, which falls within the range of mantle-derived carbon(\u03b4 13 C = -5%o \u223c-1%o), indicating C02 is probably mantle-derived. Moreover, the \u03b413 C of fluid inclusion hosted in stibnite is - 12. 6%o, which is significantly smaller than the mantle-derived carbon, suggesting a considerable amount of organic carbon was involved in ore-forming fluid during stibnite deposited. The ore-forming fluids of the Mazhala gold deposit is characteristics by high content of CO2, low salinity, low to moderate Th and low density, which are similar to those of typical orogenic gold deposits. Geologic and geochemical features show that the Mazhala goldantimony deposit may be a Cenozoic orogenic gold-antimony deposit formed under continental collisional background.",

The results show that most of the quartz and crystal samples possess very low trace elements total contents and greatly varied Rb/Sr, Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf ratios, implying that their host metamorphic rocks were not suffered extensive and strong water-rock interactions. Rb and Cs contents in some quartz samples are very low, suggesting part of the CCSD quartz veins might have been suffered ultrahigh metamorphism. REE analyses show that all of the CCSD quartz veins and Donghai crystals have LREE enriched and HREE depleted characters, implying they were mostly derived from crust. In addition, concurrence of negative and positive Ce abnormities in CCSD quartz veins suggests that parts of protolithes of the CCSD UHP metamorphic rocks might have been weathered in an oxidative environment at the surface before plate subduction. Comparatively, N-MORB normalized trace elements patterns and chondrite normalized REE patterns of the CCSD quartz veins and Donghai crystals are quite similar to those of their respective host rocks, suggest that most of the quartz veins and the crystals derived from their host metamorphic rocks, and crust fluids released during plate subduction and exhumation might migrated at grain scale.",

        "abstract": "Ailaoshan gold deposit belt formed during Himalayan orogenisis in Yunnan Province is one of the most important gold deposits belts in China, within which the Laowangzhai gold deposit is the biggest one. Fluid inclusion microtheimometry, Laser Raman analysis and carbon, hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements are carried out in fluid inclusions of auriferous quartz veins from Laowangzhai gold deposits. The fluid inclusions are mainly NaCl-H 2O and CO 2-H 2O types. Microthermometric measurements show that the homogenization temperatures range from 102\u00b0C to 302\u00b0C, with peak values of 160 - 180 \u00b0C , the salinities are 2.5% NaCleqv to 12.9% NaCleqv, with peak values of 6.0% \u223c7.5% NaCleqv,indicating that the ore-forming fluids are characterized by low salinity and mid-low temperature. Isotopic analyses show that \u03b4D h2o and 8 18O 1120 of the ore-forming fluids are - 115%o-90% e and 5. 2% o \u223c 6. 8% o, respectively, implying that the ore-forming fluids are mainly composed of magmatic fluid, with isotope interference of organic sediments. Carbon isotopic composition of the fluid inclusions lays within the range of mantle-derived carbon, suggesting that CO 2 in the ore-forming fluids was probably derived from the deep crust, even the upper mantle. Geologic and geochemical features show that the Laowangzhai gold deposit is an orogenic gold deposit formed during the Himalayan orogenisis.",

        "abstract": "Epidotes in Qinglongshan ultrahigh pressure metamorphic eclogites experienced four metamorphic stages: Early epidote-amphibolite facies prograde metamorphic stage (I), coesite-eclogite facies stage (II), quartz-eclogite facies stages (III) and late amphobolite facies retrograde metamorphic stage (IV). Chemical compositions of the epidotes formed in stage I are characterized by the high Fe2O3 contents (14.796 \u223c 17.84%) and XFe (0.413 \u223c 0.486), and low CaO and Al2O3. Epidotes formed in stage II and III show continuous compositional variation. The core which was mainly formed in stage II is relatively enriched in Fe (Fe2O3 = 11.933 \u223c 12.993%, XFe = 0.322 \u223c 0.358) and depleted in CaO and Al2O3, while the rim which was mainly formed in stage III shows relatively low Fe concentration (Fe2O3 = 9.628 \u223c 10.138%, XFe = 0.275 \u223c 0.286) and high CaO and Al2O3 contents. Epidotes formed in stage IV possess similar chemical composition with those of stage I, and are characterized by high Fe2 O3 concentrations and XFe (0.433). Compositional variation of epidotes reflects the rapid subduction and exhumation process of Su-Lu ultrahigh pressure metamorphic belt. Three kind of Fe2+ and Mg2+ bearing aqueous inclusions have been recognized in the epidote: high-salinity (22.5 to slightly more than 23.2wt% NaCl) inclusions, moderate to high salinity (12.6 \u223c 16.0wt% NaCl) and medium salinity(6.4 \u223c 11.7wt% NaCl) inclusions, which were formed in stage II, III and IV respectively. Studies of fluid inclusions in epidotes confirm that no large scale penetrative fluid flow occurred during the UHP metamorphism, and the metamorphic fluid expelled during exhumation of the Qinglongshan UHP rocks flowed mainly at grain scale.",

The results show that the total PGE (\u03a3PGE) are quite low, decreasing gradually from central massive ores (78.2 \u00d7 10-9 - 556 \u00d7 10-9) to olivine pyroxenite (0.472 \u00d7 10-9 - 67.0 \u00d7 10-9), gabbro (0.847 \u00d7 10-9) and, websterite (0.76 \u00d7 10-9 - 0.809 \u00d7 10-9). The intruded lamprophyre dykes also show low \u03a3PGE (2.98 \u00d7 10-9 - 4.07 \u00d7 10-9). The \u03a3PGE exhibits obvious positive correlations with Au, Ni and Cu contents. Primitive mantle normalized PGE patterns of the massive Cu-Ni ores are of the Pt-Pd type with relatively steep and trough-like patterns, which are similar to those of the host rocks. In addition, the Pt/Pd and Cu/Pd ratios of the massive sulfide ores are similar to those of host rocks. These characteristics suggest that sulfides in the massive ores are of magmatic origin, co-genetic with their host rocks. The relatively high Pt/Pd ratios of the Baimazhai massive sulfide ores (averaging 0.83) and their host rocks imply that the Baimazhai sulfides formed in a single sulfide saturation event. High Ir contents (0.77 \u00d7 10-9 - 5.52 \u00d7 10-9, averaging 2.35 \u00d7 10-9) and dramatically variable Pd/Ir ratios (4.76 - 296, averaging 138) of the massive sulfide ores suggest that the Baimazhai sulfide ores are of magmatic origin, but might have suffered significant late stage hydrothermal alteration. The initial 187 Os/188 Os value of 0.456 \u00b1 0.026 indicates crustal contamination has played an important role during mineralization. The proportion of crust-derived Os is calculated to be more than 30%.",

        "title": "The discovery of native gold in massive sulfides from the Edmond hydrothermal field, Central Indian Ridge and its significance",
        "abstract": "There are three types of hydrothermal precipitates sampled from the Edmond hydrothermal field, Central Indian Ridge: Fe-rich massive sulfides mainly composed of pyrite and chalcopyrite, silica-rich hydrothermal precipitates, and anhydrite-dominated sulfate ore samples. Irregular-shaped or tabular grains of native gold ( <20\u03bcm) mainly associated with anhydrite and sphalerite have been identified in sulfate ore samples and Fe-rich massive sulfides by SEM/EDS observation and XPS analysis. This is the first documented occurrence of native gold grains in seafloor hydrothermal precipitates from the Edmond vent field, CIR. To a lesser extent, gold occurs as submicroscopic particles deposited on the surface of coarse-grained pyrite. EPMA results indicate that high gold contents (with an average of 6700 \u00d7 10 -6 Au) are associated with late-stage, low-temperature ( Fe-poor) sphalerite, and silver is significantly enriched in sulfosalt minerals (5.0% \u223c 6. 7% Ag) occurring at the margins of exsolved chalcopyrite grains within sphalerite. In conclusion, the mineralization of precious metals in polymetallic massive sulfides is closely related to late-stage, low to moderate temperature hydrothermal ore-forming processes at the seafloor. Evaluation of possible complexes of gold indicates that AuCl 2 - or AuHS is the dominant complex, which is consistent with the high temperature and chlorinity of acidic end-member hydrothermal fluids in the Edmond vent field. Mixing of hydrothermal fluids and seawater, together with conductive cooling and/or phase separation may be important factors controlling gold precipitation and enrichment.",

The long axis of all the exsolutions are nearly parallel with the C axis of the apatite, suggesting that they were probably expelled synchronously. The monazite exsolutions are in the form of rhombus to platy idiomorphism, with a width of 6 \u223c 10\u03bcm and a length of about 50 \u223c 75\u03bcm. Th-U-Pb chemical dating of the monazite exsolutions by electron probe show their U-Pb isochrone age is 202 \u00b1 28.3 Ma, implying that the apatite aggregates were probably formed during recrystallization and retrograde metamorphism of the exhumated UHP rocks such as eclogites in the late Triassic Epoch.

        "abstract": "We have identified abundant exsolutions in apatite aggregates from eclogitic drillhole samples of the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD) project. Electron microscope and laser Raman spectroscopy analyses show that the apatite is fluorapatite, whereas exsolutions that can be classified into four types: (A) platy to rhombic monazite exsolutions; (B) needle-like hematite exsolutions; (C) irregular magnetite and hematite intergrowths; and (D) needle-like strontian barite exsolutions. The widths and lengths of type A monazite exsolutions range from about 6\u201310 \u03bcm (mostly 6 \u03bcm) and about 50\u201375 \u03bcm, respectively. Type B exsolutions are parallel with the C axis of apatite, with widths ranging from 0.5 to 2 \u03bcm, with most around 1.5 \u03bcm, and lengths that vary dramatically from 6 to 50 \u03bcm. Type C exsolutions are also parallel with the C axis of apatite, with lengths of \u223c30\u2013150 \u03bcm and widths of \u223c10 to 50 \u03bcm. Type D strontian barite exsolutions coexist mostly with type B hematite exsolutions, with widths of about 9 \u03bcm and lengths of about 60\u201370 \u03bcm. Exsolutions of types B, C and D have never been reported in apatites before. Most of the exsolutions are parallel with the C axis of apatite, implying that they were probably exsolved at roughly the same time. Dating by the chemical Th\u2013U-total Pb isochron method (CHIME) yields an U\u2013Pb isochron age of 202 \u00b1 28 Ma for monazite exsolutions, suggesting that these exsolutions were formed during recrystallization and retrograde metamorphism of the exhumed ultrahigh pressure (UHP) rocks. Quartz veins hosting apatite aggregates were probably formed slightly earlier than 202 Ma. Abundant hematite exsolutions, as well as coexistence of magnetite/hematite and barite/hematite in the apatite, suggest that the oxygen fugacity of apatite aggregates is well above the sulfide-sulfur oxide buffer (SSO). Given that quartz veins host these apatite aggregates, they were probably deposited from SiO 2 -rich hydrous fluids formed during retrogression of the subducted slab. Such SiO 2 -rich hydrous fluids may act as an oxidizing agent, a feasible explanation for the high oxygen fugacity in convergent margin systems. 1 Introduction Mantle wedges above the subduction zone, and consequently arc magmas, are usually considerably more oxidized compared to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and ocean island basalts (OIB) ( Ballhaus, 1993; Brandon and Draper, 1996; Parkinson and Arculus, 1999; Mungall, 2002; Sun et al., 2004b ). Given that high oxygen fugacity is very important for Cu, Au ore genesis ( Sillitoe, 1997; Mungall, 2002; Sun et al., 2004a; Liang et al., 2006 ), the mechanism that leads to oxidizing convergent margin systems is of wide interest. It is generally agreed that the high oxygen fugacity in the mantle wedge and arc magmas are due to the addition of subduction-released oxidizing fluids or melts ( Brandon and Draper, 1996; Luhr and Aranda-Gomez, 1997; Parkinson and Arculus, 1999 ). In general, C, H, S and Fe are elements, which are present in sufficient abundance and have variable oxidation states in the mantle, necessary to influence the redox states of the mantle ( Mungall, 2002 ). Of the four elements, carbon and sulfur play very minor roles in oxidizing mantle rocks to oxygen fugacities above the SSO buffer ( Brandon and Draper, 1996; Mungall, 2002 ). Water content is the most obvious difference between convergent margin environments and those for MORB and OIB: both mantle wedges and arc magmas have considerably more water than MORB and OIB due to the recycling of water-rich fluids released from subducting slabs ( Wood et al., 1990; Arculus, 1994 ). The effects of water, however, depend on the physical separation of its decomposition products: H 2 and O 2 ( Brandon and Draper, 1996 ), which is thought to be difficult in the mantle ( Mungall, 2002 ). In contrast, Fe is believed to be the most important redox agent, and the only one that can introduce very high oxygen fugacity into the convergent margin system ( Mungall, 2002 ). It was therefore argued that \u201cif an arc magma has logfO 2 > SSO buffer, then it must contain a component of melted oceanic crust\u201d ( Mungall, 2002 ). Here, however, we report abundant oxide exsolutions identified in apatite aggregates from eclogitic drillhole samples from the CCSD, which strongly suggests that solute-rich hydrous fluids can also act as an oxidizing agent that lead to high oxygen fugacity in convergent margin systems ( Brandon and Draper, 1996 ). 2 Geological background and samples The Dabie\u2013Sulu belt is the eastern part of the Qinling\u2013Dabie orogenic belt in central China, which was formed by subduction ( Sun et al., 2002c ) and consequent collisions between different microplates ( Li and Sun, 1996; Li et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1996; Meng and Zhang, 2000; Sun et al., 2002b ), followed by final continental collisions between the South and North China Blocks in the Triassic period ( Li et al., 1993; Liou et al., 1996; Sun et al., 2002a,c; Zheng et al., 2003 ). It is, so far, the largest recognized ultrahigh pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt in the world. Studies show that the whole belt was once subducted down to more than 100 km depths ( Xu et al., 1992; Jin et al., 1998; Yang and Jahn, 2000; Ye et al., 2000 ). Therefore, it has been a hot topic among geoscientists ( Liou and Zhang, 1996; Carswell et al., 2000; Li et al., 2000; Ye et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 2004; Xiao et al., 2006 ). In order to investigate the evolution of the Qinling\u2013Dabie orogenic belt, the CCSD project was carried out in the southern limb of the Su-Lu ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic terrain in Donghai County of Jiangsu Province ( Xu et al., 1998; Xu, 2004; Zhang et al., 2005a ) ( Fig. 1 ). The drill core obtained from the main hole of the CCSD consists mainly of eclogites, ortho- and paragneisses, ultramafic rocks, and some schist and quartzite ( Zhang et al., 2004, 2005c ). The major rock-forming minerals are garnet, omphacite, phengite, quartz and kyanite, and the main accessory minerals are rutile, apatite and paragonite ( Zhang et al., 2004 ). Apatite, which is one of the most common accessory minerals in the CCSD eclogites ( Zhang et al., 2005b ), is believed to have recorded subduction and exhumation history of the CCSD UHP rocks. Apatite aggregates with oriented oxide inclusions have been found in many CCSD quartz vein samples (e.g., samples 2005011, 2005038, 2005049, 2003571, 2003588). The apatite samples reported here were collected from the CCSD main drill hole at the depth of 370 m. The sample number is 2003558 (B162R140P1g). The host rock is pyrite- and rutile-bearing quartz eclogite with quartz veins. Apatite occurs as massive aggregates to irregular veins with widths of 2\u20135 cm in quartz veins ( Fig. 2 a). 3 Analytical methods Laser Raman analysis was done at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry with a Renishaw RM 2000 Raman spectrometer with 5 mw of 514 nm Ar laser excitation at room temperature. The beam size for Raman spectroscopy was 2 \u03bcm. Electron microprobe and scanning analyses were carried out in the Modern Analytical Center of Sun Yatsen University by using a JXA-8800R electron microprobe with an Oxford inca-300 energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The analytical accelerating voltage was 20 kV. The detection limit of the electron microprobe was 0.2% and resolution of the secondary electron images was 6 nm. Cobalt was used in calibration of peaks of EDS analysis. CHIME dating of monazite exsolutions was performed by a JXA-8800M electron microprobe in the State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research at Nanjing University. The monazite grains for CHIME dating were selected under a polarized microscope and observed by a scanning electron microscope in order to avoid inclusions or fractures. UO 2 , ThO 2 and Pb-glass were used as standards for U, Th and Pb concentrations. The operating conditions were an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, electricity current of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 A, and an electron beam diameter of 1 \u03bcm. Measuring time and background were 100 and 50 s for U and Th, and 200 and 100 s for Pb. The detection limits for U, Th and Pb were 46, 60 and 46 ppm, respectively. 4 Results 4.1 Mineralogy of oriented mineral inclusions Electron microprobe analyses show that the apatite is fluorapatite in composition ( Fig. 2 b). Oriented mineral inclusions in the apatite can be classified into two types: transparent and opaque. The former are usually light yellow-color crystals of 6\u201310 \u03bcm \u00d7 50\u201370 \u03bcm in size, and unevenly distributed in apatite. The latter are mostly needle-like to irregular massive crystals. Both transparent and opaque inclusions are oriented needle-like grains, parallelling to the C axis of host apatite grains. Through microprobe and laser Raman analyses, we have identified four types of oriented mineral inclusions in apatite: [A.] Platy to rhombic monazite inclusions, which are mostly elongated parallel to the C axis of host apatite, have widths of 6\u201310 \u03bcm and lengths of 50\u201375 \u03bcm ( Fig. 3 a and b). Electron microprobe analyses show that the monazites contain P, O, Th, S and high concentrations of light rare earth elements (LREE). The P and O contents as percentages of total atom weight are 15.83 and 66.72%, respectively, with P/O atomic ratios of approximately 1/4, indicating that they are LREE phosphate minerals. The total atomic percentage of LREE is 15.03% and LREE/PO 4 \u2248 1. Therefore, the Type A inclusions are Th and S bearing monazites with a molecular formula of (LREE)PO 4 . The ThO 2 concentration of this type of monazite is 1.82 wt% ( Fig. 3 ), which is much higher than the usual 0.5% in monazite intergrown with apatite in typical metamorphic rocks ( Anderssona et al., 2002 ). [B.] Needle-like hematite inclusions, which are also mostly elongated parallel to the C axis of host apatite, have widths of only 0.5\u20132 \u03bcm, with most around 1.5 \u03bcm, and lengths that vary dramatically from 6 to 50 \u03bcm ( Fig. 4 a). Electron microprobe analyses show that they are MgO-bearing (0.48%) iron oxides. Laser Raman analyses demonstrate that they are hematite with specific peaks of 226, 292, 408 and 653 cm \u22121 ( Fig. 4 b). [C.] Irregular magnetite and hematite intergrowths, which occur as massive opaque blebs with length of 30\u2013150 \u03bcm and widths of 10\u201350 \u03bcm ( Fig. 5 a). Electron microprobe analyses show that they are iron oxides with 98.3 wt% Fe 2 O 3 , 0.66 wt% MgO and 1.04 wt% CaO. Laser Raman analyses demonstrate that they are hematite and magnetite intergrowths, the specific peaks for the former are 221, 287 and 403 cm \u22121 , while that for the latter is 665 cm \u22121 . The high CaO concentration is likely due to signals from the host. [D.] Needle-like strontian barite inclusions have widths of about 9 \u03bcm and lengths of about 60 to 70 \u03bcm ( Fig. 6 a). Electron probe analyses show that they contain S, Sr, Ba, O and a small amount (0.86 wt%) of Ca. The atomic percentages of S and O are 16.5 and 66.5%, respectively, with S/O of about 1:4, confirming that they are sulfate minerals ( Fig. 6 b). In addition, the total atomic percentages of Ba and Sr together are approximately the same as SO 4 . Therefore, the type D mineral inclusions are strontian barite with a molecular formula of (Sr, Ba)SO 4 . Laser Raman analyses demonstrate that they are barite with specific peaks at 992, 648, 618 and 459 cm \u22121 ( Fig. 6 c). 4.2 CHIME dating of the monazite exsolutions Monazite contains high amounts of radioactive elements, such as U and Th, with negligible common Pb ( Williams et al., 1983; Corfu, 1988; Parrish, 1990; Williams and Jercinovic, 2002 ), making it a suitable mineral for dating by CHIME ( Suzuki and Adachi, 1991, 1998; Montel et al., 1996; Rhede et al., 1996; Cocherie and Albarede, 2001 ). Although the analytical error of CHIME (\u00b110 \u223c 30 Ma) is larger than that associated with the sensitive high resolution microprobe (SHRIMP) method, the CHIME method is well-suited for dating monazite grains with a diameter of less than 20 \u03bcm, and particularly monazite exsolutions because the electron beam can be adjusted to 1\u20132 \u03bcm. In this study, 51 monazite inclusions in apatite aggregates were analyzed using an electron microscope. The results are shown in Table 1 and plotted on Fig. 7 . The isochron line gives an intercept of 0.0020 \u00b1 0.0025 and a slope of 0.0085 \u00b1 0.001. The isochron age of the monazites is calculated with the CHIME software created by ( Suzuki and Adachi, 1991, 1994 ), yielding a result of 202 \u00b1 28 Ma, MSWD = 2.02. 5 Discussion For the following reasons, we propose that these oriented needle-like mineral inclusions in apatite formed through exsolution during decompression. First, all the inclusions are oriented roughly parallel to C axes of the host apatite. It is difficult to enclose such a large number of tiny minerals arranged in the same direction. Second, the inclusions are very small and needle-like; while their oxygen fugacities are far above those of host eclogites, none of them can survive without protection of apatite. Moreover, all the mineral inclusions are hosted only in apatite, with no inclusions found in any other minerals in the quartz veins. Given that apatite in quartz veins is younger than the host eclogite, it would be very difficult for the inclusions to be selectively captured by apatite. Apatite has a specific hexagon structure with channels paralleling the C axis, and can thus hold a large number of elements with large radius ions under UHP; these elements can then be released during decompression and form exsolutions. Needle-like monazite inclusions in apatite have been found previously in Dabie\u2013Sulu eclogites ( Liou et al., 1998; Zhang and Liou, 1999 ). These authors proposed that the monazite inclusions may have exsolved from host apatite during decompression ( Liou et al., 1998; Zhang and Liou, 1999 ). More recently, both monazite and sulfide (such as pyrrhotite and pyrite) inclusions in apatites from eclogites were attributed to exsolution during decompression ( Hong et al., 2003; Zhu and Massonne, 2005 ). In this study, we found abundant mineral inclusions oriented along crystalgraphic axes in apatite aggregates associated with quartz veins in CCSD eclogites under microscope. Laser Raman and electron microprobe analyses demonstrated that the inclusions were monazite, iron oxides and barite. To our knowledge, this is the first report of iron oxide and barite exsolutions in apatite. Abundant hematite exsolutions, as well as the coexistence of magnetite/hematite and barite/hematite exsolutions in apatite, suggest that the oxygen fugacity of apatite aggregates is well above the SSO buffer. By contrast, the host rock is pyrite- and rutile-bearing quartz eclogite, which has dramatically lower oxygen fugacity. These facts suggest that the oxidizing components hosted in apatite originated in deeper levels and migrated to the current locations. Given that apatite aggregates are closely associated with quartz veins, these highly oxidizing components were probably closely associated with Si-rich hydrous fluids, which are very common fluids released from subducting slabs. The origins of the quartz veins in the CCSD samples, and in Dabie\u2013Sulu orogenic belt in general, remain uncertain. Early studies suggested that the quartz veins formed through an influx of later-stage external fluids ( Li et al., 2001 ). Based on the lack of UHP minerals and isotopic data, it was later proposed that the quartz veins did not undergo UHP peak metamorphism, but formed mainly in P-T conditions between UHP and HP metamorphism of eclogites during exhumation of the subducted plate and before recrystallization of HP eclogites ( Zheng, 2004 ), during retrograde metamorphism ( Sun et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006a,b ). A recent study, however, reported the occurrence of N 2 -CH 4 inclusions in quartz veins in CCSD eclogites, which indicates that at least some quartz veins in CCSD UHP rocks formed quite early and probably underwent UHP metamorphism ( Xu et al., 2006a,b ). Moreover, the lack of UHP minerals in quartz veins cannot be used to argue that these quartz veins formed at low pressure because, without protection (e.g., as inclusions in zircon or garnet), UHP minerals usually disappear during retrograde metamorphism. In fact, coesite pseudomorphs hosted in garnet and allanite in quartz veins have been found in many different locations, including CCSD samples ( Zhai et al., 2005 ). For Dabie UHPM rocks, three episodes of eclogite-facies metamorphisms, at 254\u2013239 , 238\u2013230 and 218\u2013206 Ma, respectively, have been identified based on SHRIMP dating and multiphase metamorphic textures and index mineral inclusions within zircon ( Liu et al., 2006a,b ). Based on evolutional processes and geochronology, Zhang et al. (2005c) established the UHPM P-T-t path of the Dabie\u2013Sulu belt and proposed that this area experienced epidote amphibolite facies prograde metamorphism (stage I), UHPM (stage II), coesite eclogite facies retrograde metamorphism (stage III), quartz eclogite retrograde metamorphism (stage IV), granulite facies retrograde metamorphism (stage V), amphibolite facies retrograde metamorphism (stage VI), epidote amphibolite facies retrograde metamorphism (stage VII), and greenschist facies retrograde metamorphism (stage VIII) ( Zhang et al., 2005c ). Based on previous results in geochronology and metamorphic petrology, the age of 202 \u00b1 28 Ma for monazite exsolutions in the apatite aggregates implies that the formation of apatites occurred from quartz eclogite retrograde metamorphism (stage IV) to amphibolite facies retrograde metamorphism (stage VI) during exhumation of the subducted plates. The UHPM rocks were raised rapidly from a depth of 100\u201330 km at a rate of about 4 km/Ma, resulting in a dramatic decline in pressure, coupled with a slow decrease in temperature with a cooling rate of about 8 \u00b0C/km, and simultaneous dehydration and decomposition of minerals ( Xu et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005c ). Some of the quartz veins may have formed as a consequence of this process. Overall, retrogression from eclogite to amphibolite metamorphism requires the addition of water. In other words, the whole retrograde metamorphism process usually forms more hydrous minerals than those being decomposed. In contrast, hydrous fluids released from subducting slabs are usually Si-rich. Therefore, no matter what pressure the quartz veins formed at, the source materials were supplied through subduction. We propose that apatite aggregates were probably formed at very high pressures, so that they contained high concentrations of oxides, and exsolutions occurred when pressure diminished during retrograde metamorphism. Impurity elements incorporated in apatite at high pressure became unstable and were expelled from the host minerals. Combination of the expelled LREE with P produced monazite exsolutions, while Sr and S combined to form stronian barite, and iron oxide formed magnetite and hematite. Considering that apatite aggregates with oriented oxide inclusions have been found in many CCSD samples (e.g., samples 2005011, 2005038, 2005049, 2003571, 2003588), the appearance of apatite aggregates with a large amount of iron oxides and sulfates in the CCSD quartz veins suggests the formation of highly oxidizing SiO 2 -rich hydrous fluids during the subduction process. This kind of fluid is very likely to have contributed to the generation of high oxygen fugacity in convergent margin systems, mantle wedges, and arc magmas. These highly oxidizing components suggest that a slab-derived melt is not always necessary to produce arc magmas with high oxygen fugacity (above the SSO buffer). Highly oxidizing hydrous fluids may have played a more important role than previously recognized. Note that the host eclogites are much more reducing compared to fluids, so a considerable amount of oxidizing components in fluids might have been lost through interactions with the wall rocks during ascent, resulting in the preservation of only the oxidizing components enclosed in apatite aggregates. 6 Conclusions Apatite aggregates in quartz veins from CCSD drill hole samples were most likely formed through deposition of slab-derived Si-rich fluids. Abundant hematite exsolutions, as well as the coexistence of magnetite/hematite and barite/hematite assemblages in apatite, show that the oxygen fugacity of apatite aggregates is well above the SSO buffer. Consequently, slab-derived fluids can be highly oxidizing. This kind of fluid is very likely one of the efficient agents that caused the high oxygen fugacity in convergent margin systems.

        "title": "Fluid inclusion and isotope geochemistry of the Yangla copper deposit, Yunnan, China",
        "abstract": "The Yangla copper deposit, with Cu reserves of 1.2 Mt, is located between a series of thrust faults in the Jinshajiang\u2013Lancangjiang\u2013Nujiang region, Yunnan, China, and has been mined since 2007. Fluid inclusion trapping conditions ranged from 1.32 to 2.10\u00a0kbar at 373\u2013409\u00a0\u00b0C. Laser Raman spectroscopy confirms that the vapour phase in these inclusions consists of CO2, CH4, N2 and H2O. The gas phases in the inclusions are H2O and CO2, with minor amounts of N2, O2, CO, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6. Within the liquid phase, the main cations are Ca2+ and Na+ while the main anions are SO4 2\u2212 and Cl\u2212. The oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of the ore-forming fluids (\u22123.05\u2030\u2009\u2264\u2009\u03b418OH2O\u2009\u2264\u20092.5\u2030; \u2212100\u2030\u2009\u2264\u2009\u03b4D\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2212120\u2030) indicate that they were derived from magma and evolved by mixing with local meteoric water. The \u03b434S values of sulfides range from \u22124.20\u2030 to 1.85\u2030(average on \u22120.85\u2030), supporting a magmatic origin. Five molybdenite samples taken from the copper deposit yield a well-constrained 187Re\u2013187Os isochron age of 232.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4\u00a0Ma. Given that the Yangla granodiorite formed between 235.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u00a0Ma and 234.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u00a0Ma, the Cu metallogenesis is slightly younger than the crystallization age of the parent magma. A tectonic model that combines hydrothermal fluid flow and isotope compositions is proposed to explain the formation of the Yangla copper deposit. At first, westward subduction of the Jinshajiang Oceanic Plate in the Early Permian resulted in the development of a series of thrust faults. This was accompanied by fractional melting beneath the overriding plate, triggering magma ascent and extensive volcanism. The thrust faults, which were then placed under tension during a change in tectonic mode from compression to extension in the Late Triassic, formed favorable pathways for the magmatic ore-forming fluids. These fluids precipitated copper-sulfides to form the Yangla deposit.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Skarn alteration occurs over a wide range of temperatures and geological settings, and hydrothermal magnetite (a common mineral in skarn) represents a potentially useful temperature and tectonic indicator. Here we describe a new 2D/3D quantitative element mapping approach to evaluate the element mobility of magnetite during skarn alteration/mineralization. Magnetite grains from the giant Beiya Fe-Au skarn deposit (Yunnan, SW China) are either coarse-grained euhedral (hexagonal) with core-rim zoning (type I) or subhedral unzoned (type II) coexisting with (some enclosing) garnet. Concentrations of Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sr, Cr and Mn in the type I magnetite core and rims are drastically different, which are high in the core and outer rim and low in the inner rim. This suggests fluid geochemical fluctuations, probably led by multiple phases of ore fluid incursions that are common in many world-class skarn deposits. Concentrations of Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Mn and Sr in the garnet are higher than those in type II magnetite. This is likely because the earlier garnet crystallization (during the prograde skarn alteration) had depleted these elements in the later magnetite ore fluids. Both the garnet and the magnetite core are characterized by high Ti concentration. The high Ti concentration in the garnet is governed by the crystal structure, while that of Ti in hydrothermal magnetite is governed by Ti mobility. The 3D-mapping and simulation modeling have shown clear element variation patterns in some magnetite grains that were previously determined to be compositionally homogeneous by spot analysis. Our new 2D/3D-mapping have revealed the presence of mineral inclusions such as garnet and calcite as constrained by the trace element mobility during the replacement of garnet by magnetite, as shown in the euhedral zoned magnetite in garnet pseudomorph.",

        "abstract": "The giant Beiya Au skarn deposit and Machangqing porphyry Cu-Mo-(Au) deposit are located in the middle part of the Jinshajiang\u2013Ailaoshan alkaline porphyry metallogenic belt. The Beiya deposit is the largest Au skarn deposit in China, whilst the Machangqing deposit comprises a well-developed porphyry-skarn-epithermal Cu-Mo-(Au) mineral system. In this paper, we present new allanite U-Th-Pb ages and trace element geochemical data from the two deposits and discuss their respective skarn metallogenesis. Based on the mineral assemblage, texture and Th/U ratio, the allanite from the Beiya and Machangqing deposits are likely hydrothermal rather than magmatic. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) allanite U-Th-Pb dating has yielded Th-Pb isochron ages of 33.4 \u00b1 4.6 Ma (MSWD = 0.22) (Beiya) and 35.4 \u00b1 9.8 Ma (MSWD = 0.26) (Machangqing), representing the retrograde alteration and magnetite skarn mineralization age of the two deposits. The Beiya and Machangqing alkali porphyry-related mineralization are synchronous and genetically linked to the magmatic hydrothermal activities of the Himalayan orogenic event. Major and trace element compositions reveal that the Beiya allanite has higher Fe3+/(Fe3+ + Fe2+) ratios, U content and Th content than the Machangqing allanite, which indicate a higher oxygen fugacity and F content for the ore-forming fluids at Beiya. Such differences in the ore-forming fluids may have contributed to the different metallogenic scales and metal types in the Beiya and Machangqing deposit.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Machangqing Cu-Mo-dominated polymetallic deposit is a porphyry-skarn-epithermal Cu-Mo (-Au) metallogenic system located in the middle part of the Jinshajiang\u2013Ailaoshan alkaline porphyry metallogenic belt. The skarn mineralization of the Machangqing deposit mainly occurs along the contacts between the alkalic porphyry intrusions and the surrounding Lower Ordovician Xiangyang Formation rocks. We present LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages and trace element data for titanite from the Machangqing deposit in order to investigate the origin of this deposit. Based on mineral textures and assemblages, two types of titanite are recognized in Machangqing: magmatic titanite (Type I) from the granite porphyry and hydrothermal titanite from the mineralized skarn. The coarse-grained magmatic titanite is euhedral and occurs as discrete grains in the interstices of feldspar, quartz and biotite, whereas fine- to medium-grained hydrothermal titanite crystals (Type II) are euhedral to subhedral and occur in association with skarn minerals such as garnet, pyroxene and magnetite. Magmatic titanite has lower FeO, Al 2 O 3 , F and Nb/Ta but higher TiO 2 , Th/U, HFSEs and Lu/Hf than hydrothermal titanite. The magmatic titanite has higher LREE/HREE ratios and total REE contents with stronger negative Eu anomalies than its mineralized skarn counterpart. Trace elemental characteristics of hydrothermal titanite in Machangqing are consistent with relatively low F contents and oxygen fugacities when compared to the neighboring Beiya gold-dominated polymetallic deposit in the same metallogenic belt. The weighted average  206 Pb/ 238 U age of 34.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.2\u202fMa of hydrothermal titanite is within error but slightly younger than the age of magmatic titanite (37.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.1\u202fMa), indicating that the skarn mineralization followed the emplacement of the granite porphyry and was broadly coeval with the porphyry mineralization. The porphyry and skarn types of mineralization at Machangqing were formed from the same metallogenic system. Different ore-forming conditions, such as oxygen fugacities and F contents, might be responsible for different metal enrichments at the Machangqing and Beiya deposits.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Beiya gold\u2013polymetallic deposit, located in the middle of the Jinshajiang\u2013Ailaoshan alkaline porphyry metallogenic belt, is the largest skarn gold deposit in China. Scheelite is a typical hydrothermal mineral which can serve as mineralization process tracer and is significant for the hydrothermal deposit study. In this paper, we present in-situ LA-ICP-MS scheelite geochemical data from the different parts of the skarn mineralization in the Beiya deposit. The data indicate that the Beiya scheelite has high Mo (average: 38,943\u00a0ppm) and high LREE/HREE (average: 29.6), resembling typical skarn-type scheelite. The mechanism of REE substitution of Ca in the Beiya scheelite was probably 3Ca 2\u00a0+ \u00a0=\u00a02REE 3\u00a0+ \u00a0+\u00a0\u25a1Ca, which implies that the scheelite inherited its REE composition from magma-derived ore-forming fluids. The scheelite from near the marble shows negative Eu anomaly (average \u03b4Eu: 0.45), indicating an oxidizing condition, whereas that from near the porphyry shows positive Eu anomaly (average \u03b4Eu: 3.58), indicating a reducing environment. Scheelite from the sandstone-hosted stratiform orebody shows slight and variable Eu anomalies (\u03b4Eu: 0.66\u20131.47), indicating possible fluctuating physicochemical conditions. Our data demonstrate an increasing oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) trend from the ore-related intrusion to the surrounding carbonates at Beiya. The Rb/Sr, Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf ratios of the Beiya scheelite suggest an addition of mantle-derived components to the ore-forming materials of the Beiya deposit.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Robust dating of hydrothermal deposits is critical to understand ore genesis, which depends on judicious selection of mineralization-related chronometers, especially for complex polymetallic mineral systems. The Beiya deposit in southwest China is a world-class polymetallic gold system (11.9\u202fMoz Au at a grade of 2.52\u202fg/t) and the main mineralization is considered as skarn-type. However, available dating results for the gold mineralization give a wide range of ages, which in some cases could be inaccurate due to the use of non matrix-matched external isotope standards or an equivocal relationship between gold and the dated minerals. In this contribution, hydrothermal monazite coexisting with gold-bearing ore minerals (magnetite, pyrite and chalcopyrite) from high-grade massive magnetite-(sulfide) gold ores at Beiya was dated in situ using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The U-Th-Pb analyses of hydrothermal monazite yielded a  208 Pb/ 232 Th age of 36.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202fMa (2\u03c3, MSWD\u202f=\u202f2.0, n\u202f=\u202f27), which is considered a robust age for the Beiya skarn gold mineralization. Our study supports a genetic link between the skarn gold mineralization and the post-collisional quartz monzonite magmatism at Beiya based on a new zircon U-Pb age of 37.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4\u202fMa. Compared with the previously-reported molybdenite Re-Os and sphalerite Rb-Sr isochron ages, our monazite U-Th-Pb result suggests that the gold deposition was broadly coeval with the formation of molybdenite but probably prior to the local Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization at Beiya.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Yuanjiang marble-hosted ruby deposit in the middle Ailao Shan-Red River (ASRR) shear zone, is the only economic ruby deposit in China. This deposit is hosted in Paleoproterozoic sillimanite gneisses and the ores are found in metamorphosed platform carbonates. Rubies are unevenly distributed within calcite-rich marble layers and mainly associated with phlogopite, scapolite, graphite, pyrite. Rubies contain zircon, rutile, apatite, calcite inclusions. The genesis of the Yuanjiang ruby deposit and its genetic link to the ASRR shear zone remain poorly understood. In this contribution, its formation age has been indirectly constrained by the in-situ LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of zircon inclusions in rubies and  40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of syngenetic phlogopite from the ruby-phlogopite bearing marble, which yielded the ages of 36.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.1\u202fMa (MSWD\u202f=\u202f1.4, 2\u03c3, n\u202f=\u202f4) and 22.2\u201322.5\u202fMa, respectively. The 36.2\u202fMa U-Pb age of metamorphic zircon inclusions falls within the range of local crustal thickening related subduction-collision and coupled with the spatial distribution in which ruby deposits were not restricted in the shear zone, we propose that ruby mineralization was triggered by the local continental subduction-collision rather than the large-scale left-lateral shearing. Due to the estimated closure temperature of the  40 Ar- 39 Ar system is lower than the ore-forming temperature, the obtained phlogopite  40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of 22.2\u201322.5\u202fMa represent the minimum ore-forming age of the Yuanjiang ruby deposit. These phlogopite ages reveal a slower cooling rate of ruby deposits within the shear zone (including the Yuanjiang and the Yen Bai ruby deposits) than outside of the shear zone (the Luc Yen deposit), which can be attributed to the additional heat from the left-lateral shearing movement. Therefore, we propose that the left-lateral shearing plays an important role in transporting marble-hosted ruby deposits in the Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone to the subsurface.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Beiya gold\u2013polymetallic deposit, located in the middle of the Jinshajiang\u2013Ailaoshan alkaline porphyry metallogenic belt, is one of the largest gold deposits in China. The mineralization mainly occurs in skarn along the intrusive contacts between the alkaline porphyries and Middle Triassic limestone. In this paper, we present U\u2013Pb age as well as major and trace element geochemistry of titanite from the Beiya deposit, and distinguish the titanite into a magmatic- and a hydrothermal suite. Our study indicates that the titanite from the ore-related porphyry and from the mineralized skarn is texturally and geochemically very different. The euhedral, envelope-shaped titanite from the ore-related porphyry has lower FeO, F, HFSEs, Nb/Ta and Lu/Hf, together with higher TiO 2  and Th/U than the subhedral titanite from the mineralized skarn. The titanite from the porphyry also displays higher LREE/HREE and more subtle negative Eu anomaly than its mineralized skarn counterpart. This suggests a magmatic- and a hydrothermal origin for, respectively, the titanite from the ore-related porphyry and from the mineralized skarn. In-situ magmatic titanite U\u2013Pb dating has yielded an Eocene age of 36.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9\u00a0Ma, consistent with the porphyry zircon U\u2013Pb age (36.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43\u00a0Ma) obtained in previous studies. Hydrothermal titanite has yielded a weighted average  206 Pb/ 238 U age of 33.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a02.0), which represents the age of the retrograde skarn alteration and the maximum age for the gold mineralization. Together with the previous molybdenite Re\u2013Os age, we have further constrained the Beiya gold\u2013polymetallic metallogeny to 33.1\u201334.1\u00a0Ma. The mineralization age is slightly younger than the porphyry emplacement, indicating that the Beiya metallogeny was likely to be a post-magmatic hydrothermal product of the Himalayan orogenic event. The REE characteristics of hydrothermal titanite also reveal that the ore forming fluids may have been derived from a highly oxidized magma.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Distal Pb\u2014Zn skarn commonly displays ambiguous relationships with the nearby intrusions, leading to poorly constrained and often controversial skarn metallogenic models. In this study, we discuss the potential usage of spessartine, a common U-bearing gangue mineral in many Pb\u2014Zn skarn deposits, in U\u2014Pb dating. Spessartine from the Talate skarn Pb\u2014Zn deposit (Xinjiang, NW China) can be divided into two types (GI and GII) based on mineral assemblage. GI spessartine (Sp 56.5  Al 28.3  Gr 12.4  to Sp 66.0  Al 22.3  Gr 8.5 ) is coarse-grained with core-rim texture occasionally well-preserved, disseminated magnetite and magmatic TI titanite grains are hosted within the spessartine GI core, indicating that the spessartine GI is slightly postdate the magmatic titanite TI and disseminated magnetite. GII massive spessartine (Sp 64.2  Al 24.8  Gr 2.7  to Sp 69.6  Al 20.1  Gr 1.2 ) occurs with hydrothermal titanite TII and shows a close relationship with coarse-grained hydrothermal magnetite, and is cut by quartz or fine sulfide (e.g., pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite) veins.  The flat time-resolved signals obtained from the depth profile analyses and inclusion-free trace element mapping of U in spessartine indicate that the U is structurally bounded in the lattice. Both GI and GII spessartine show clear positively correlation between U, Al and Mn, but no apparent correlation is present between U and Fe, which indicates that Al and Mn are more important in the U incorporation in spessartine. Integrating with the positive correlations with U and LREEs in spessartine, which suggest U is incorporated in the lattice by a substitution of [U 4+ ] VIII \u202f+\u202f2[Al 3+ ] IV \u202f\u2212\u202f[Ca 2+ ] VIII \u202f+\u202f2[Si 4+ ] IV . In-situ U\u2014Pb dating of the two spessartine types yielded a weighted average  206 Pb/ 238 U age of 231.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.2\u202fMa (GI; MSWD\u202f=\u202f0.56; n\u202f=\u202f35) and 211.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.8\u202fMa (GII; MSWD\u202f=\u202f1.1; n\u202f=\u202f47). Considering the errors caused by common Pb and matrix mismatch, the corrected GI and GII spessartine ages are consistent with the TI (228.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.6\u202fMa; MSWD\u202f=\u202f2; n\u202f=\u202f28) and TII (209.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.6\u202fMa; MSWD\u202f=\u202f1.03; n\u202f=\u202f39) titanite ages, suggesting that spessartine U\u2014Pb dating is robust and reliable. The least 8.1\u202fMy gap between the formation of the two titanite and spessartite types reflects two mineralization events, suggesting an influx of magmatic fluids during the retrograde alteration/mineralization. Our study represents a new way of directly constraining the timing of skarn alteration/mineralization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, we discuss the application of U-Pb dating on U-rich, common-Pb bearing grossular-rich garnet and the issues of common Pb correction. Grossular-rich garnet samples were collected from the Baoshan and Huangshaping areas of the Pingbao skarn district (Hunan, South China). The Baoshan garnet comprises Gr 64.3  And 34.0  to And 99.0  Gr 0.2  (Gr\u202f=\u202fGrossular; And\u202f=\u202fAndradite), with minor spessartine (0.43\u20131.45%), almandine (0\u20130.61%) and pyrope (0.01\u20130.91%). The Huangshaping 304 garnet comprises Gr 41.7  And 56.0  to Gr 70.2  And 25.9  with minor spessartine (1.42\u20132.10%), whereas the Huangshaping 301 garnet comprises Gr 62.0  And 26.6  Spe 11.2  to Gr 74.5  And 20. 9  Pyr 2.5  Spe 2.1  (Spe\u202f=\u202fSpessartine, Pyr\u202f=\u202fPyrope).  The Baoshan garnet grains are subhedral to euhedral with well-developed core-rim textures and contain approximately 1\u201310\u202fppm U. The Huangshaping 304 garnet is also euhedral with grains size ranging from several to tens of millimeters. The core-rim textured garnet grains are compacted together with interstitial quartz and contain about 5\u201310\u202fppm U. The Huangshaping 301 garnet is anhedral to tabular with interstitial quartz and magnetite, and contains up to 579\u202fppm U.  In-situ  U-Pb dating of the Baoshan, Huangshaping 304 and 301 garnet samples yielded consistent anchored y-intercept ages at 162.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.9\u202fMa (n\u202f=\u202f60; MSWD\u202f=\u202f1.5); 160.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.5\u202fMa (n\u202f=\u202f59; MSWD\u202f=\u202f1.9) and 160.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3\u202fMa (n\u202f=\u202f60; MSWD\u202f=\u202f4.1), respectively. These ages are consistent with the new and published zircon and titanite U-Pb ages (162\u2013160\u202fMa), indicating that the garnet U-Pb ages are reliable and the technique is robust. We suggest that the non-U-bearing mineral correction has involved in the third-party common Pb ratio, which is believed to be a better correction for the system common Pb.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Beiya deposit, located in the Sanjiang Tethyan tectonic domain (SW China), is the third largest Au deposit in China (323\u00a0t Au @ 2.47\u00a0g/t). As a porphyry-skarn deposit, Beiya is related to Cenozoic (Himalayan) alkaline porphyries. Abundant Bi-minerals have been recognized from both the porphyry- and skarn- ores, comprising bismuthinite, Bi\u2013Cu sulfosalts (emplectite, wittichenite), Bi\u2013Pb sulfosalts (galenobismutite, cosalite), Bi\u2013Ag sulfosalt (matildite), Bi\u2013Cu\u2013Pb sulfosalts (bismuthinite derivatives), Bi\u2013Pb\u2013Ag sulfosalts (lillianite homologs, galena-matildite series), and Bi chalcogenides (tsumoite, the unnamed Bi 2 Te, the unnamed Ag 4 Bi 3 Te 3 , tetradymite, and the unnamed (Bi, Pb) 3 (Te, S) 4 ). Native bismuth and maldonite are also found in the skarn ores. The arsenopyrite geothermometer reveals that the porphyry Au mineralization took place at temperatures in the range of 350\u2013450\u00a0\u00b0C and at log  f S 2  in the range of \u2212\u00a08.0 to \u2212\u00a05.5, respectively. In contrast, the Beiya Bi-mineral assemblages indicate that the skarn ore-forming fluids had minimum temperatures of 230\u2013175\u00a0\u00b0C (prevailing temperatures exceeding 271\u00a0\u00b0C) and fluctuating  f S 2 \u2013 f Te 2  conditions. We also model a prolonged skarn Au mineralization history at Beiya, including at least two episodes of Bi melts scavenging Au. We thus suggest that this process was among the most effective Au-enrichment mechanisms at Beiya.",

The magmatic-hydrothermal disseminated magnetite is Nb-Ta-Ti-depleted, whereas the hydrothermal disseminated magnetite associated with skarn alteration is geochemically similar to the Ca-skarn (with slight Ta-Mg-Ni depletions). The massive magnetite ores have similar Ni concentrations with the Ca-skarn, but contain minor depletions in Sn, Sc, Ta, Nb, Mg and Co, probably attributed to magma-host rock interactions. The Talate hydrothermal disseminated magnetite contains lower Sn than magnetite from typical skarn deposits, and likely resulted from cassiterite crystallization as it is found co-precipitated with disseminated magnetite. Both magmatic-hydrothermal and hydrothermal disseminated magnetite are characterized by narrow Ti concentration range and variable Co/Ni ratios, which likely reflect rapid cooling rate and significant fluid-rock interaction during multiple successive stages of skarn alteration, as the Co has a higher solubility over the Ni in the ore-forming fluid. Whereas the Talate massive magnetite contains wider Ti concentration range and in some cases with 120\u00b0 triple junctions, the Co/Ni ratios (mostly",

        "abstract": "In hydrothermal ores, gold is commonly hosted by sulfide minerals due to its affinity for reduced sulfur. In contrast, the occurrence of gold in oxide minerals remains poorly documented and incompletely understood. In this contribution, we demonstrate that magnetite can be a significant host mineral for gold. Skarn ores from the giant Beiya Au deposit (323 t Au at 2.47 g/t), southwest China, contain abundant nanometer- to micronsized gold hosted by magnetite. A range of bismuth minerals (e.g., native bismuth, maldonite, and bismuthinite) occur within the same assemblage. Textural and mineralogical studies as well as thermodynamic modeling indicate that Bi melts scavenged Au from hydrothermal fluids during magnetite growth. Fluctuating     f    O  2      (  g  )     at the surfaces of crystallizing magnetite led to the precipitation of Bi-Au melt, ongoing gold refinement, and entrapment of gold and bismuth minerals within magnetite. Sulfidation of Bi, triggered by increased sulfur content and/or decreased temperature, further promoted gold precipitation. Bismuth melts are interpreted to have played a crucial role in Au enrichment from gold-undersaturated fluids at Beiya. The results imply that magnetite-rich systems are also potential targets for Au exploration and extraction, particularly in cases where coexisting Bi minerals are observed in abundance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Beiya gold\u2013polymetallic deposit is one of the largest gold deposits in China and is considered to be a typical porphyry-skarn system located in the middle of the Jinshajiang\u2013Ailaoshan alkaline porphyry metallogenic belt. Massive magnetite is widespread in the Beiya ore district but its genesis is still the subject of debate. Five representative magnetite types are present in the Beiya deposit, namely magmatic magnetite (M1) from the ore-related porphyry, disseminated magnetite (M2) from the early retrograde alteration, massive magnetite (M3) from the early quartz-magnetite stage, massive magnetite (M4) from the middle quartz-magnetite stage and magnetite (M5) from the late quartz-magnetite stage. Compared with the M1 magnetite, the magnetites from stages M2 to M5 are depleted in Ti, Al and high field strength elements, implying a hydrothermal origin, distinct from the magmatic accessory magnetite in the ore-related porphyry (M1). The concentrations of cobalt in the hydrothermal magnetites decrease gradually from M2 to M5, and can be used to discriminate the magnetite types. The Al\u00a0+\u00a0Mn and Ti\u00a0+\u00a0V contents of the successively precipitated magnetite grains (M2\u2013M5) suggests that the ore forming temperature decreased from M2 to M4, but increased from M4 to M5, possibly as the result of a new pulse of magma entering the chamber, which may have triggered the gold mineralization. The V content in the hydrothermal magnetite suggests that the oxygen fugacity increased from M2 to M4 but decreased as soon as the sulfides entered the system (M5).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Carbonate-replacement Zn-Pb deposits are formed through fluid circulation within carbonate rocks and are an important global source of Zn and Pb. The Caixiashan carbonate-replacement deposit is one of the largest Zn-Pb systems in China. The Mesoproterozoic syn-sedimentary stage (I) of the Caixiashan deposit is characterized by sulfides with negative \u03b4 34 S values (\u221225.3 to\u202f\u22128.6\u2030) generated by organic sulfate reduction, which co-precipitated with the host rocks. The Neoproterozoic main sulfide precipitation stage (II) was caused by thermo sulfide reduction resulting in positive \u03b4 34 S values (7.9\u201312.3\u2030). Carbonates from stage I have \u03b4 13 C PDB  of \u22121.2 to 2.8\u2030 and \u03b4 18 O SMOW  of 17.1\u201324.0\u2030, similar to those of marine carbonate rocks. Dolomite and calcite from stage II have \u03b4 13 C PDB  ranging from \u22125.1 to \u22120.2\u2030 and \u03b4 18 O SMOW  of 14.1\u201319.7\u2030, consistent with dissolution of carbonate rock. In contrast dolomite and calcite from stage III have mantle C-O signatures with the \u03b4 13 C PDB  ranging from \u22127.5 to 0.4\u2030 and \u03b4 18 O SMOW  from 5.8 to 13.2\u2030. C-O isotopic signatures suggest that the original carbonates were dissolved by the acid generated from sulfide precipitation consistent with the sulfide precipitation process. Subsequent precipitation of carbonates created large volumes of dolomite alteration that coated the sulfides and possibly contributed to the preservation of the ore, as dolomite would dissolve more slowly than calcite. Carboniferous magmatism (stage III) resulted in a magmatic overprint on the stage II sulfide. The metal sources of these sulfide ore packets are mainly derived from the Mesoproterozoic carbonate rocks as indicated by the lead isotopes of sulfides and also C-O isotopes of carbonates. The deposit is characterized by a complex paragenesis with multiple overprinting sources of hydrothermal fluids and sulfide over 700\u202fm.y. The syn-sedimentary stage (\u223c1019\u202fMa) and main mineralization stage (859\u2013837\u202fMa) at Caixiashan are chronologically and tectonically associated with the assembly and break-up of the Rodinia supercontinent, whereas the magmatic-hydrothermal modification stage (\u223c353\u202fMa) is associated with the closure of the Paleo Asian Ocean during the Early Carboniferous.",

The abundant auriferous specular hematite veins in the Yaoan gold deposit of the Jinshajiang-Red River alkaline porphyry metallogenic belt (southwest China) contain an assemblage of Bi-sulfosalts and tellurides together with hematite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite. Bismuth-sulfosalts are characterized by replacement textures resulting from changes of fluid composition (e.g., Pb, Bi, Cu, and Ag) and mainly include bismuthinite derivatives (e.g., bismuthinite, paarite, krupkaite, lindstromite, and friedrichite-aikinite), pad\u011braite, cuprobismutite homologues (probably submicroscopic intergrowths of hodrushite and cuprobismutite), and emplectite. Tellurides are tiny, comprising tsumoite, melonite, hessite, and calaverite, which coexist with bismuthinite derivatives. These Bi-sulfosalts and tellurides have direct contact with gold, indicating that the Yaoan gold metallogenesis was likely linked to the syenite porphyry magmatism that was originally sourced from a regional lithospheric mantle probably metasomatized by subduction of Te-rich sediments. The telluride assemblage also reveals that the gold was precipitated under oxidizing conditions that has a high tellurium fugacity at the beginning ( f Te 2 \u202f=\u202f\u223c10 \u22127.9  and  f S 2 \u202f=\u202f\u223c10 \u22128.5  at \u223c300\u202f\u00b0C).",

        "abstract": "The giant Beiya Au skarn deposit (over 300 tonnes Au metal reserve) is located in the middle part of the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan alkaline porphyry metallogenic belt. The deposit is the largest Au skarn deposit and third largest Au deposit in China. In this paper, we present garnet U-Pb ages and trace element geochemical data from two types of skarn-related U-rich garnet from Beiya, and discuss their implications on skarn metallogenesis. Based on optical characteristics and major element compositions, the older Grt I and the younger Grt II (both belong to the grossular-andradite solid solution) are distinguishable: Grt II (Adr69.0Grs26.8\u2013Adr93.5Grs1.5) is slightly richer in Fe than Grt I (Adr68.5Grs20.3\u2013Adr86.3Grs3.4), with the average FeO contents being 25.0% and 24.5%, respectively. LA-ICP-MS garnet U-Pb dating yielded lower intercept ages of 35.8 \u00b1 0.8 Ma (MSWD = 0.9, n = 20) and 34.0 \u00b1 2.1 Ma (MSWD = 1.2, n = 16), respectively. These ages represent the timing of the garnet crystallization, and are consistent with published alteration ages within error, which suggests that the technique presented provides a reliable alternative in dating skarn alteration. Grt I has higher U content and lower Th/U ratio than Grt II, indicating a lower oxygen fugacity for the earlier skarn alteration. Grt II shows weak (or no) Eu anomaly and lower LREE/HREE ratios than those of Grt I, which indicates that Grt I and Grt II may have formed under a mildly acidic and nearly neutral condition, respectively. From the early prograde skarn (Grt I) to late prograde skarn (Grt II) stage, the ore-forming fluids may have changed from a relatively reduced acidic to a relatively oxidized neutral pH condition.",

        "title": "Constraints on the left lateral shearing and crustal melting of the Ailaoshan Massif, Yunnan Province, Southwest China",
        "abstract": "Abstract   The Ailaoshan-Red River shear zone (ASRR) in SE Tibet accommodated about 20% convergence of the Cenozoic India-Asia continental collision which resulted in complicated thermal history during Paleocene to Miocene. The Ailaoshan massif, in the middle part of ASRR, is characterized by extensive mylonitization and migmatization, but the exact timing of the large scale left lateral shearing and whether the crustal partial melting occurred prior to or coeval with the left lateral shearing remain controversial. The detailed structural observation suggests the pre-kinematic nature of the Ailaoshan corundum with respect to the left lateral shearing. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of metamorphic zircon and monazite inclusions in the pre-kinematic Ailaoshan corundum obtained a weighted  206 Pb- 238 U ages of 28.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202fMa (MSWD\u202f=\u202f3.3; N\u202f=\u202f27) and 28.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3\u202fMa (MSWD\u202f=\u202f1.8; N\u202f=\u202f18), respectively, which gave an upper limit on the initiation of the left lateral shearing in the Ailaoshan massif. Moreover, the presence of protogenetic siliceous melt inclusions in the pre-kinematic corundum indicates that the Cenozoic crustal anatexis of the Ailaoshan massif has occurred before the left lateral shearing. Along with available geochronological data, the crustal partial melting of the Ailaoshan massif was attributed to joint results, which at least include the Neoproterozoic convergence, the Triassic Indosinian Orogeny, and the Cenozoic evolution as a response to the India-Asia continental collision.",

        "title": "Stable isotope patterns of coexisting pyrite and gypsum indicating variable methane flow at a seep site of the Shenhu area, South China Sea",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Aggregates of authigenic pyrite and gypsum were found at site HS373 in the Shenhu seepage area, South China Sea. Most of the pyrite occurs as tubes consisting of framboids. Gypsum aggregates are mainly represented by rosettes and some of them grew over pyrite, revealing that gypsum precipitation postdated pyrite formation. At seeps, extensive sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) commonly leads to the accumulation of  34 S enriched sulfide, resulting in the formation of  32 S depleted pyrite. The sulfur isotopic composition of pyrite at site HS373 reveals a great variability of 75.5\u2030 in \u03b4 34 S values, spanning from \u221237.6\u2030 to 37.9\u2030 (V-CDT) with a distinct trend towards higher values with increasing depth. This trend indicates an increase of the effect of sulfate-driven AOM with depth, whereas pyrite at shallow depth apparently resulted mostly from organiclastic sulfate reduction. To date, reports on coexisting pyrite and gypsum in seep environments are limited, and therefore the mechanism of gypsum formation is insufficiently understood. This is the first time that the sulfur and oxygen stable isotope composition of gypsum has been analyzed to understand its formation at seeps. The \u03b4 34 S values of gypsum vary from \u221224.5\u2030 to 0.9\u2030, revealing a similar trend with depth like pyrite. The \u03b4 18 O gypsum  values range from 5.3\u2030 to 12.3\u2030 (V-SMOW), with a scattered trend to lower values with depth. The combined evidence reveals that gypsum formation was linked to the establishment of more oxidizing conditions, probably caused by waning seepage. This led to the oxidation of pyrite and the associated increase in pore water sulfate and acidity, which favored carbonate mineral dissolution, providing the calcium ions required for gypsum formation. The observed isotopic variability of gypsum suggests that oxidation occurred by different mechanisms at different depth, whereby pyrite oxidation was dominated by aerobic processes at shallow depth involving dissolved molecular oxygen, and by anaerobic processes at greater depth involving electron acceptors like ferric iron. Taken together, the stable isotope compositions of pyrite and gypsum suggest that the redox conditions within the studied sediments were variable. Such variability was controlled by complex factors, among which changes in seepage activity have been instrumental for the vertical displacement of the sulfate methane transition zone.",

        "title": "How sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane affects the sulfur isotopic composition of pyrite: A SIMS study from the South China Sea",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (SO 4 -AOM) in marine sediments commonly leads to the precipitation of pyrite. It is, however, frequently challenging to unequivocally unravel the entire history of pyritization, because of the common coexistence of SO 4 -AOM derived pyrite with pyrite resulting from organiclastic sulfate reduction (OSR). To better understand how SO 4 -AOM affects pyritization in methane-bearing sediments and how this can be identified, we applied secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to analyze the sulfur isotope composition (\u03b4 34 S) of authigenic pyrite in addition to sulfur isotope measurements of bulk sulfide and hand-picked pyrite aggregates from the two seafloor sites, HS148 and HS217, in the Shenhu seepage area, South China Sea. Authigenic, mostly tubular pyrite aggregates from these sites consist of three types of pyrite: framboids, zoned aggregates with radial overgrowths surrounding a framboidal core, and euhedral pyrite crystals. Framboids with low SIMS \u03b4 34 S values (as low as \u2212\u00a041.6\u2030 at HS148, and \u2212\u00a038.8\u2030 at HS217) are dispersed throughout the cores, but are especially abundant in the shallow part of the sedimentary column (i.e. above 483\u00a0cmbsf in HS148; above 670\u00a0cmbsf in HS217). These patterns are interpreted to reflect the dominance of OSR during early diagenetic processes in the shallow sediments. With increasing depth, both \u03b4 34 S values of bulk sulfide minerals and hand-picked pyrite aggregates increase sharply at 483\u00a0cmbsf in core HS148, and at 700\u00a0cmbsf in core HS217, respectively. Radial pyrite overgrowths and euhedral crystals become abundant at depth typified by high \u03b4 34 S values for hand-picked pyrite. Moreover, SIMS analysis reveals an extreme variability of \u03b4 34 S values for the three pyrite types on a small scale in these zones. Besides some moderately  34 S enriched framboids, most of the overgrowths and euhedral crystals display extremely high SIMS \u03b4 34 S values (as high as +\u00a0114.8\u2030 at HS148, and +\u00a074.3\u2030 at HS217), representing the heaviest stable sulfur isotope composition of pyrite ever reported to the best of our knowledge. Such an abrupt and extreme increase in \u03b4 34 S pyrite  values with depth is best explained by an enrichment of  34 S in the pool of dissolved sulfide caused by SO 4 -AOM in the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ). The increase in \u03b4 34 S values from framboidal cores to overgrowth layers and euhedral crystals indicates continuous, and finally near to complete exhaustion of dissolved sulfate at the SMTZ following a Rayleigh distillation process. SO 4 -AOM allowed for subsequent growth of later stage pyrite over the initial framboids, part of which formed earlier and at shallower depth by OSR. The combination of a detailed petrographic study of authigenic pyrite with SIMS analysis of stable sulfur isotopes in organic-rich strata proves to be a powerful tool for reconstructing the dynamics of sulfur cycling in modern and, potentially, ancient sedimentary sequences.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (SO 4 -AOM) and organiclastic sulfate reduction (OSR) in marine sediments commonly lead to the precipitation of authigenic pyrite with characteristic sulfur isotopic compositions. Yet, no reports on the iron isotopic composition of SO 4 -AOM generated pyrite exist to the best of our knowledge and the processes controlling the distribution of iron isotopes during this biogeochemical process are not understood. To investigate the mechanisms involved in iron isotope fractionation during SO 4 -AOM, we analyzed the isotopic composition of authigenic pyrite from two seafloor sites (HS148 and HS217) in the Shenhu gas hydrate area, South China Sea. The \u03b4 56 Fe values of pyrite were found to vary from \u2212\u00a00.349\u2030 to +\u00a00.267\u2030 in core HS148, and from \u2212\u00a00.793\u2030 to +\u00a00.178\u2030 in core HS217 (relative to average igneous rock) with distinct trends towards higher values with increasing burial depth in both cores. The \u03b4 56 Fe values correlate positively with the extent of pyritization (Fe py /Fe HR ) derived from a sequential iron extraction procedure. OSR was found to drive early diagenetic pyrite formation at shallow depth, resulting in relatively  56 Fe depleted pyrite. Peaks in the extent of pyritization of 0.45 and 0.47 at ca. 6 and 7\u00a0m below the sediment surface, respectively, correlate with high \u03b4 56 Fe and high \u03b4 34 S values, and are interpreted to reflect periods of enhanced SO 4 -AOM in paleo-sulfate methane transition zones (SMTZs). The great variability in iron isotopic composition and the observed trends are best explained as a function of the availability of dissolved sulfide, reflecting sulfide formation by OSR and SO 4 -AOM. The successive conversion of reactive iron to pyrite via sulfidization apparently resulted in the enrichment of  56 Fe in the iron reservoir upon the preferential consumption of isotopically light iron, leading to the formation of successively  56 Fe-enriched pyrite especially at or in close proximity to the SMTZ. Therefore, we hypothesize that the combined enrichment of heavy iron isotopes and  34 S in authigenic pyrite is a possible tracer of SO 4 -AOM in modern and ancient sedimentary sequences.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts are deep-sea sedimentary polymetallic minerals that are explored for their economic potential, particularly for Mn, Cu, Co, Ni and rare earth elements (REEs). The precipitation mechanism of the metallic elements in crusts has remained controversial between chemical oxidation (abiotic origin) and microbial enzymatic processes (biomineralization). In this study, the microbial mineralization in ferromanganese crusts from the Western Pacific Ocean was explored. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analyses showed abundant micron-scale spherical aggregates of Mn-oxide filaments (20\u201380\u00a0nm), which are closely associated with filamentous cells within the biofilm (biofilm mineralization) exist within the stromatolitic structure. The high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and phylogenetic analysis suggests that biofilms are dominated by three Mn-oxidizing bacterial species from the families  Bacillus ,  Arthrobacter  and  Pseudomonas . In addition, Mn concentration in the biofilms is approximately 10 8  times that of the associated seawater (2.3\u00a0ppb\u00a0Mn). Iron (16.2\u00a0wt%), Cu (0.11\u00a0wt%), Co (0.719\u00a0wt%) and Ni (0.459\u00a0wt%) were found in the biofilms via X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). We suggest that biomineralization provides a new perspective for understanding Fe-Mn crustal-related mineral deposits, and the ultra-high microbial trace element enrichment ability is noteworthy. Utilization of microbial activities in accumulating precious metals from seawater may offer a viable alternative for the world\u2019s metal production in the future.",

Here, we analyzed the multiple sulfur isotopic compositions for elemental sulfur and pyrite from an iron-dominated gas hydrate-bearing sedimentary environment of the South China Sea to unravel the impact of sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (SO 4 -AOM) on the formation of elemental sulfur. The multiple sulfur isotopes reveal variable ranges for both elemental sulfur and pyrite (\u03b4 34 S: between \u221215.7 and +23.3\u2030 for elemental sulfur and between \u221235.3 and +34.4\u2030 for pyrite; \u0394 33 S: between \u22120.08 and +0.06\u2030 for elemental sulfur and between \u22120.03 and +0.15\u2030 for pyrite). The enrichment of  34 S in pyrite throughout the sediment core suggests pronounced SO 4 -AOM in paleo-sulfate-methane transition zones (SMTZ). In addition, the occurrence of seep carbonates with very negative \u03b4 13 C values (as low as \u221257\u2030, V-PDB) coincides with the inferred paleo-SMTZs and agrees with formerly locally pronounced SO 4 -AOM. Interestingly, the multiple sulfur isotopic composition of elemental sulfur reveals a different pattern from that of pyrite derived from organoclastic sulfate reduction (i.e., with low \u03b4 34 S and high \u0394 33 S values for the latter). In comparison to coexisting pyrite, most of the elemental sulfur reveals higher \u03b4 34 S values (as much as +28.9\u2030), which is best explained by an enrichment of  34 S in the residual pool of dissolved sulfide generated by SO 4 -AOM. As an intermediate sulfur phase, elemental sulfur can form via sulfide oxidation coupled to iron reduction, but it can only persist in the absence of free sulfide. Therefore, the occurrence of  34 S enriched elemental sulfur is likely to represent an oxidative product after hydrogen sulfide had vanished due to vertical displacement of the SMTZ. Our observations suggest that elemental sulfur may serve as a useful recorder for reconstructing the dynamics of sulfur cycling in modern and possibly ancient seepage areas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Multiple sulfur isotope signatures and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) sulfur isotope compositions of pyrite from two seafloor sites (DH-CL11 and HD109) in seepage areas of the South China Sea were measured in order to study isotope effects of sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (SO 4 -AOM). The multiple sulfur isotopes of pyrite reveal variable ranges for both sites (\u03b4 34 S: between \u221244.1\u2030 and \u22122.9\u2030 for DH-CL11 and between \u221243.8\u2030 and \u22121.6\u2030 for HD109; \u0394 33 S: between 0.02\u2030 and 0.17\u2030 for DH-CL11 and between \u22120.03\u2030 and 0.14\u2030 for HD109). SIMS analysis reveals an extreme variability of \u03b4 34 S values (between \u221250.3\u2030 and \u22122.7\u2030 in DH-CL11; between \u221250.1 and 52.4\u2030 in HD109) for three types of pyrite: (1) framboids, (2) zoned aggregates with radial overgrowth surrounding a framboidal core, and (3) euhedral pyrite crystals. The synchronous changes of geochemical proxies (sulfate and methane concentrations, \u03b4 34 S sulfate  and \u03b4 18 O sulfate , \u03b4 34 S pyrite , and pyrite content) at the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) at site DH-CL11 are interpreted to be induced by SO 4 -AOM under steady state conditions. In contrast, pyrite content and \u03b4 34 S value fluctuations throughout core HD109 suggest that the sediment at this site was affected by multiple pyritization events during diagenesis. Multiple sulfur isotope signatures of early diagenetic pyrite (i.e., with low and high \u03b4 34 S values, the latter above 315 cmbsf in DH-CL11; above 70 cmbsf in HD109) in the upper sediment column suggest that organoclastic sulfate reduction (OSR) and sulfur disproportionation generated the observed isotopic signatures. In contrast to the early diagenetic  34 S depleted framboids, the higher SIMS \u03b4 34 S values of overgrowth and euhedral crystals suggest a late diagenetic  34 S enriched pool of dissolved sulfide derived from SO 4 -AOM at the current and paleo-SMTZs. Interestingly, pyrite resulting from SO 4 -AOM in the SMTZ at site DH-CL11 reveals a distinct pattern with higher \u0394 33 S values, different from pyrite resulting from OSR and sulfur disproportionation. Therefore, paired \u03b4 34 S and \u0394 33 S values may allow to differentiate OSR and SO 4 -AOM, although a full understanding of the isotope effects associated with SO 4 -AOM is hampered by uncertainties on the actual electron transfer mechanism in the syntrophic SO 4 -AOM consortium.",

However, reports on the iron isotopic composition of SO 4 -AOM generated pyrite are limited, and the mechanisms controlling the fractionation of iron isotopes are insufficiently understood. Here, we present new iron isotope data for pyrite and iron oxides from sediments of the Taixinan seepage and gas hydrate-bearing area (sites HD109 and GMGS2-16) and revisit published data for pyrite from the Shenhu area to unravel the impact of SO 4 -AOM on the iron isotope composition of pyrite. The \u03b4 56 Fe values (relative to average igneous rock) of pyrite were found to vary from \u22120.86 to \u22120.56\u2030 for site HD109, and from \u22121.57 to \u22120.25\u2030 for site GMGS2-16. In contrast, the iron isotopic compositions of iron oxides from site GMGS2-16 reveal positive values throughout the core, spanning from +0.52\u2030 to +0.74\u2030. In addition, the extent of pyritization (Fe py /Fe HR ) of the sediment was investigated, revealing a variability between 0.01 and 0.29 for HD109, and between 0.00 and 0.36 for GMGS2-16. A previous study on the Shenhu seepage area recognized an enrichment of  56 Fe in pyrite at (paleo-)sulfate-methane transition zones (SMTZ), which was regarded as a consequence of pronounced SO 4 -AOM. However, peaks in \u03b4 56 Fe py  values are not observed at (paleo-)SMTZs at sites HD109 and GMGS2-16 in this study. The negative \u03b4 56 Fe py  values are likely to reflect the dominance of dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) during diagenesis in this area. In addition, for all samples of the Taixinan and Shenhu areas, their \u03b4 56 Fe py  values, and the extent of pyritization, a clear positive correlation becomes apparent, where both \u03b4 56 Fe py  values and Fe py /Fe HR  ratios from the Taixinan area are lower. Hence, it can be inferred that the availability of sulfide is among the key factors that affect the iron isotopic composition of pyrite. With respect to the Taixinan area, the low degree of pyritization was apparently insufficient to alter the iron isotopic composition of the iron sources (i.e., iron oxides) to a significant degree.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Rare earth elements (REE) and yttrium (Y), termed as REY, are recently found to be extremely enriched in some pelagic sediments, which could be an important resource for REY in the future. However, their enrichment mechanism remains controversial. Because biogenetic apatite is one of the most important REY carriers in REY-rich deep-sea sediment, it is critical to identify its mineralogical and geochemical characteristics by using combined methods of  in situ  chemical analysis and atomic resolution chemical imaging.  Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that bioapatite fossils mainly consist of aligned hydroxyapatite nano-plates. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analyses show that the REY are not uniformly distributed within the studied bioapatite fossils. Concentration profiles from the measurements and modeling analyses indicate that the major REY should be incorporated into the bioapatite fossil from seawater as well as the pore water during the early stage of diagenesis. Z-contrast imaging results reveal the following two possible coupled substitutions in the apatite: REE 3+ \u202f+\u202fNa + \u202f\u2194\u202f2Ca 2+  and/or REE 3+ \u202f+\u202fSi 4+ \u202f\u2194\u202fCa 2+ \u202f+\u202fP 5+ , which is distinguished from those ion-absorption-type REE deposits on land. Our study indicates that bioapatite fossils are prone to undergo alteration during diagenesis, and thus cautious examination should be taken when applying REE signal of bioapatite as a proxy for palaeo-ocean environmental reconstruction.",

        "title": "Contribution of thermogenic organic matter to the formation of biogenic gas hydrate: Evidence from geochemical and microbial characteristics of hydrate-containing sediments in the Taixinan Basin, South China Sea",
        "abstract": "Abstract   High-saturation (40\u2013100%), microbial gas hydrates have been acquired by expedition GMGS2 from the Taixinan Basin. In this study, geochemical and microbial features of hydrate-containing sediments from the drilling cores (GMGS2-09 and GMGS2-16) were characterized to explore their relationships with gas hydrate formation. Results showed that the average TOC content of GMGS2-09 and GMGS2-16 were 0.45% and 0.63%, respectively. They could meet the threshold for  in situ  gas hydrate formation, but were not available for the formation of high-saturation gas hydrates. The dominant members of Bacteria at the class taxonomic level were Alphaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Bacteroidia, Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, and those in Archaea were Marine_Benthic_Group_B (MBGB), Miscellaneous_Crenarchaeotic_Group (MCG), Group C3, Methanomicrobia and Methanobacteria. Indicators of microbes associated with thermogenic organic matter were measured. These include: (1) most of the dominant microbes had been found dominant in other gas hydrates bearing sediments, mud volcanos as well as oil/coal deposits; (2) hydrogenotrophic methanogens and an oilfield-origin thermophilic, methylotrophic methanogen were found dominant the methanogen community; (3) hydrocarbon-assimilating bacteria and other hyperthermophiles were frequently detected. Therefore, thermogenic signatures were inferred existed in the sediments. This deduction is consistent with the interpretation from the seismic reflection profiles. Owing to the inconsistency between low TOC content and gas hydrates with high saturation, secondary microbial methane generated from the bioconversion of thermogenic organic matters (oil or coal) was speculated to serve as enhanced gas flux for the formation of high-saturation gas hydrates. A preliminary formation model of high-saturation biogenic gas hydrates was proposed, in which diagenesis processes, tectonic movements and microbial activities were all emphasized regarding to their contribution to gas hydrates formation. In short, this research helps explain how microbial act and what kind of organic matter they use in forming biogenic gas hydrates with high saturations.",

        "title": "Mineralogy, geochemistry and genesis of the polymetallic crusts and nodules from the South China Sea",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Recent marine mineral investigations in the South China Sea (SCS) have found increasingly significant abundances of Fe\u2013Mn polymetallic crusts and nodules with variable substrates and nuclei. There is, however, no systematic and complete study of the SCS crusts and nodules. The lack of mineralogical and geochemical studies affects our explicit understanding of the mineralization characteristics and genesis of the crusts and nodules. In this study, we analyzed a set of SCS polymetallic crusts and nodules obtained from ten sites to determine their mineralogy, chemistry, and Fe and Os isotopes. The SCS crusts/nodules are composed predominantly of vernadite (\u03b4\u2013MnO 2 ) and amorphous Fe oxides/hydroxides. The nodules also contain minor todorokite. TEM imaging and electron diffractions show that the Fe\u2013Mn minerals are nano\u2013sized minerals with very poor crystallinity. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis indicates an average specific surface area of 257.128 m 2 /g for the SCS crusts and nodules, and main apertures of 2\u201310\u00a0nm for their nanopores in the Fe\u2013Mn minerals. It is noteworthy that the SCS crusts/nodules contain substantial amount of terrigenous detritus, suggesting that marginal sea\u2013type Fe\u2013Mn deposits are strongly influenced by terrigenous sedimentary input. Furthermore, geochemical analysis indicates that the SCS crusts/nodules have relatively lower Co (1482\u00a0ppm), Cu (556.2\u00a0ppm), Ni (3132\u00a0ppm), Mo (276.2\u00a0ppm), and Zn (598.3\u00a0ppm) compared to open oceanic crusts/nodules, but relatively high concentrations of REY (1647\u00a0ppm), PGE (234.0\u00a0ppb), Ba (1056\u00a0ppm), Pb (1878\u00a0ppm), Sr (995.9\u00a0ppm), Te (28.81\u00a0ppm), and Tl (67.87\u00a0ppm). Iron isotopic compositions suggest that the Fe sources of the SCS crusts/nodules may have been Fe dissolved in terrigenous (fluvial) inputs. Osmium isotopes indicate that the main ore\u2013forming elements came directly from the ambient seawater, which was mainly influenced by terrigenous inputs, although there may have been mixing with minor mantle\u2013derived signatures.  Evidence from mineralogy, major element geochemistry, shale\u2013normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns, and the Fe and Os isotopes suggest that the SCS crusts/nodules are mainly hydrogenetic, whilst the formation of some nodules may have been contributed by minor pore waters of their surrounding sediments. The SCS crusts/nodules had probably much higher growth rates (mean 19.20\u00a0mm/Ma) than most hydrogenetic Fe\u2013Mn deposits in other open oceans, which are typical of marginal sea Fe\u2013Mn deposits that contain sufficient supply of ore\u2013forming terrigenous detritus.  Grades of some critical metals of economic interest (notably Co, Cu, Ni, Mo, and Zn) are slightly lower in the SCS crusts and nodules than in the crust and nodules from Pacific prime mineralization zones. Concentrations of Mn, REY, Pt, Mo, Co, Te, and Bi, however, show relatively high concentrations relative to the continental crust. The SCS crusts and nodules could thus represent a strategic REE, Co and Pt resource, and will likely catalyse additional investigation of seabed resources in the South China Sea.",

        "title": "Biogenic mineralization in the ferromanganese nodules and crusts from the South China Sea",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Global marine ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and crusts host immense metal resources, and the metal enrichment mechanism is still in dispute. The South China Sea (SCS) is one of the largest marginal seas in the western Pacific, and its northern slope is a passive continental margin with high sedimentary rate. A large amount of ferromanganese nodules and crusts have been discovered in the SCS northern slope. Previous investigations shown that the SCS nodules/crusts are often smaller and thinner, and contain higher Si and Al but lower Mn, Co and Ni than the Western Pacific nodules and crusts. In this study, high resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were performed to explore the microorganism activities with respect to the nodules/crusts formation. Various biogenic signature and microfossils in the SCS Fe-Mn nodules/crusts are recorded. These bio-marks and microfossils present several morphological types: tubiform burrows, bulbiform organism fossils, mould structures, cylindrical protozoan, globular growth structures, isolated spheroidal bacteria and biofilms. These mineralized bio-marks and microfossils are mostly protozoans belonging to various bacteria, biofilm, diatoms and coccoliths with Mn and/or Fe on their surface. Using the electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA), the microfossil-rich areas contain higher Mn than the surrounding microfossil-poor areas are observed. The abundance of bio-marks and microfossils and their geochemical features support a dominant role of microorganism activities in the SCS nodule/crustal formation. We proposed that microorganisms may have served as seeds/templates to induce mineral deposition in the nodules and crusts, and chemical oxidation and other abiotic mechanisms also contribute to the Fe-Mn oxide formation. The biogenic hypothesis provides another perspective to further understand the formation of deep marine Fe-Mn nodules/crusts, and will be important for exploration of Fe and Mn metals in the future.",

        "title": "Distribution of Rare Earth Elements plus Yttrium among Major Mineral Phases of Marine Fe\u2013Mn Crusts from the South China Sea and Western Pacific Ocean: A Comparative Study",
        "abstract": "Marine hydrogenetic Fe\u2013Mn crusts on seamounts are known as potential mineral resources of rare earth elements plus yttrium (REY). In recent years, increasing numbers of deposits of Fe\u2013Mn crusts and nodules were discovered in the South China Sea (SCS), yet the enrichment mechanism of REY is yet to be sufficiently addressed. In this study, hydrogenetic Fe\u2013Mn crusts from the South China Sea (SCS) and the Western Pacific Ocean (WPO) were comparatively studied with mineralogy and geochemistry. In addition, we used an in situ REY distribution mapping method, implementing laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and a sequential leaching procedure to investigate the partitioning behavior of REY in the Fe\u2013Mn crusts. The typical Fe\u2013Mn crusts from SCS were mainly composed of quartz, calcite, vernadite (\u03b4-MnO2), and amorphous Fe oxides/hydroxides (FeOOH). The Fe\u2013Mn crusts from the Central SCS Basin and the WPO contained quartz, \u03b4-MnO2, FeOOH, todorokite, and phillipsite. Furthermore, geochemical analysis indicated that the typical SCS crusts had a higher growth rate and lower REY concentrations. The LA-ICP-MS mapping results showed that the \u03b4-MnO2 and FeOOH dominated the occurrence phases of REY in the SCS crusts. Four mineral phases (i.e., easily exchangeable and carbonate, Mn-oxide, amorphous FeOOH, and residual aluminosilicates) in these Fe\u2013Mn crusts were separated by a sequential leaching procedure. In the SCS and WPO crusts, the majority of total REY (\u03a3REY) was distributed in the Mn-oxide and amorphous FeOOH phases. The post-Archean Australian shale-normalized REY patterns showed that light REY (LREY) and heavy REY (HREY) were preferentially adsorbed onto \u03b4-MnO2 and FeOOH, respectively. It is noteworthy that ~27% of \u03a3REY was associated with the residual aluminosilicates phase of the WPO crusts. The La/Al ratios in the aluminosilicates phase of the typical SCS crusts were the values of the upper crust. We conclude that large amounts of terrigenous materials dilute the abundance of REY in the SCS crusts. In addition, the growth rates of Fe\u2013Mn crusts have a negative correlation with the FeOOH-bound and aluminosilicate-bound REY. As a result of the fast growth rates, the SCS crusts contain relatively low concentrations of REY.",

        "title": "He-Ar Isotopes and Trace Gas Compositions of Fluid Inclusions in Massive Sulphides from the Yushui Copper-Polymetallic Deposit, South China: Metallogenic Implications",
        "abstract": "The Yushui ore deposit, located in the middle section of the Yong\u2019an-Meixian Hercynian depression, is a medium-sized Cu-polymetallic massive sulphide deposit in Eastern Guangdong Province, South China. This deposit is characterized by unusually high copper grade (up to 50\u201360 wt. % Cu). Other metallic elements, such as lead, zinc and silver, are also economically important in the Yushui ore bodies. The aim of this study was to apply N2\u2013Ar\u2013He systematics, together with organic gases (light-hydrocarbon tracers), to constrain the origin and evolution of ore-forming fluids. The helium-argon isotopes and trace gas compositions of fluid inclusions trapped within metal sulphide minerals were measured for a number of bonanza ores from the Yushui deposit. The noble gas concentrations in the studied samples vary over one to two orders of magnitude (4He: 2.27\u2013160.00 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm3 STP g\u22121; 3He: 0.53\u201334.88 \u00d7 10\u221212 cm3 STP g\u22121; 40Ar: 6.28\u201337.82 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm3 STP g\u22121; 36Ar: 1.25\u201310.40 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm3 STP g\u22121). Our data show a narrow range of 3He/4He ratios from 0.006 to 0.056 Ra (~0.026 Ra on average, n = 8), which are considerably lower than the modern atmospheric end-member value; whereas the 40Ar/36Ar ratios (ranging from 333.76 to 501.68, with an average of 397.53) are significantly greater than that of air-saturated water. Most of the bornite samples have somewhat higher 3He/4He ratios of trapped fluids when compared to chalcopyrite. Overall, these He-Ar results are well within the range of crustal reservoir, thus implying a predominantly crustal source (originated from Caledonian basement) for ore-forming solutions, with little contribution from mantle-derived fluids. Analysis of the N2\u2013Ar\u2013He composition in Cu-rich sulphides indicates that the Yushui ore-forming fluids were probably derived from formation water (or basinal hot brines). Moreover, organic gas species identified in sulphide-hosted fluid inclusions are mainly composed of C1\u2013C4 alkanes, while the concentrations of unsaturated olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons are very low. In particular, most chalcopyrite samples with relatively low 3He/4He ratios (0.006\u20130.016 Ra) and 40Ar*/4He values (0.0002\u20130.0012) are generally characterized by very high CO2/CH4 ratios (~60\u2013102). All these suggest that main-stage Cu-Ag metallogenic processes might have not been affected by high-temperature magmatic activities or superimposed by strong metamorphic overprinting, although some chalcopyrite-rich ores appear to be influenced by later stage hydrothermal processes. In summary, neither magmatic input nor convecting seawater has played an important role in the formation of Yushui copper-polymetallic deposit. The massive sulphide ore bodies were products of water\u2013rock interaction between metal-bearing basinal brines and the host sedimentary strata.",

        "abstract": "Noble gases have become a powerful tool to constrain the origin and evolution of ore-forming fluids in seafloor hydrothermal systems. The aim of this study was to apply these tracers to understand the genesis of newly discovered polymetallic sulphide deposits along the ultraslow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR). The helium, argon, and sulphur isotope compositions of metal sulphide minerals were measured for a number of active/inactive vent fields in the Indian Ocean. The helium concentrations and isotopic ratios in these ore samples are variable (4He: 0.09\u20132.42 \u00d7 10\u22128 cm3STP\u2219g\u22121; 3He: 0.06\u20133.28 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm3STP\u2219g\u22121; 3He/4He: 1.12\u20139.67 Ra) and generally greater than the modern atmosphere, but significantly lower than those in massive sulphides from the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR), especially for three Cu\u2013Fe-rich samples from the ultramafic-hosted Tianzuo and Kairei vent fields. On the contrary, most of the SWIR sulphide deposits have somewhat higher 40Ar/36Ar ratios of trapped fluids (ranging from 290.6 to 303.4) when compared to the EPR ore samples. Moreover, the majority of sulphide minerals from the Indian Ocean have much higher \u03b434S values (3.0\u2030\u20139.8\u2030, ~5.9 on average, n = 49) than other basaltic-hosted active hydrothermal systems on the EPR. Overall, these He\u2013Ar\u2013S results are well within the range of seafloor massive sulphide deposits at global sediment-starved mid-ocean ridges (MORs), lying between those of air-saturated water (ASW) and mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) end members. Therefore, our study suggests that the helium was derived mainly from the MORB mantle by degassing during the high-temperature stage of hydrothermal activity, as well as from a mixture of vent fluids with variable amounts of ambient seawater during either earlier or late-stage low-temperature hydrothermal episodes, whereas the argon in ore-forming fluids trapped within sulphide minerals was predominantly derived from deep-sea water. Additionally, relatively high \u03b434S values exhibit a great estimated proportion (up to nearly 40%) of seawater-derived components. In summary, sub-seafloor extensive fluid circulation, pervasive low-temperature alteration, shallow seawater entrainment, and mixing processes, may make a larger contribution to the SWIR hydrothermal ore-forming systems, compared to fast-spreading centres.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the He and Ar isotope compositions were measured for the Fe-Mn polymetallic crusts and nodules from the South China Sea (SCS), using the high temperature bulk melting method and noble gases isotope mass spectrometry. The He and Ar of the SCS crusts/nodules exist mainly in the Fe-Mn mineral crystal lattice and terrigenous clastic mineral particles. The results show that the 3He concentrations and R/RA values of the SCS crusts are generally higher than those of the SCS nodules, while 4He and 40Ar concentrations of the SCS crusts are lower than those of the SCS nodules. Comparison with the Pacific crusts and nodules, the SCS Fe-Mn crusts/nodules have lower 3He concentrations and 3He/4He ratios (R/RA, 0.19 to 1.08) than those of the Pacific Fe-Mn crusts/nodules, while the 40Ar/36Ar ratios of the SCS samples are significantly higher than those of the Pacific counterparts. The relatively low 3He/4He ratios and high 40Ar concentrations in the SCS samples are likely caused by terrigenous detrital input with high radiogenic 4He and 40Ar contents. The SCS crusts and nodules have shorter growth periods, implying that in situ post-formation radiogenic 3He, 4He and 40Ar produced by decay of U, Th and K have no effect on their isotope compositions. Thus, the SCS crusts/nodules inherited the noble gases characteristics of their sources. Helium and Ar isotope compositions in the SCS Fe-Mn crusts and nodules reflect the product of an equilibrium mixture between air-saturated seawater and radiogenic components during their growth, while the partial 3He excess in some SCS samples may represent a little mantle-derived origin. The different He and Ar isotope compositions of the Fe-Mn crusts and nodules between the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean are due to their different sources and genetic processes. The characteristics of He and Ar isotope compositions in the SCS polymetallic crusts and nodules are similar to the properties of hydrogenetic Fe-Mn oxide/hydroxide precipitates, which reflects mainly the product of an equilibrium mixture between air-saturated seawater and radiogenic components.",

A graph is called antimagic if it has an antimagic labeling. The antimagicness of the Cartesian product of graphs in several special cases has been studied [Tao-Ming Wang, Toroidal grids are anti-magic, in: Proc. 11th Annual International Computing and Combinatorics Conference, COOCOON'2005, in: LNCS, vol. 3595, Springer, 2005, pp. 671-679, Yongxi Cheng, A new class of antimagic cartesian product graphs, Discrete Mathematics 308 (24) (2008) 6441-6448]. In this paper, we develop new construction methods that are applied to more general cases. We prove that the Cartesian product of paths is antimagic, if one of them has at least three edges. This (almost) answers the open problems in [Yongxi Cheng, Lattice grids and prisms are antimagic, Theoretical Computer Science 374 (2007) 66-73]. We also prove that the Cartesian product of an antimagic regular graph and a connected graph is antimagic, which extends the results of the latter of the two references, where several special cases are studied.",

        "title": "Optimal pricing for improving efficiency of taxi systems",
        "abstract": "In Beijing, most taxi drivers intentionally avoid working during peak hours despite of the huge customer demand within these peak periods. This dilemma is mainly due to the fact that taxi drivers' congestion costs are not reflected in the current taxi fare structure. To resolve this problem, we propose a new pricing scheme to provide taxi drivers with extra incentives to work during peak hours. This differs from previous studies of taxi market by considering market variance over multiple periods, taxi drivers' profit-driven decisions, and their scheduling constraints regarding the interdependence among different periods. The major challenge of this research is the computational intensiveness to identify optimal strategy due to the exponentially large size of a taxi driver's strategy space and the scheduling constraints. We develop an atom schedule method to overcome these issues. It reduces the magnitude of the problem while satisfying the constraints to filter out infeasible pure strategies. Simulation results based on real data show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which opens up a new door to improving the efficiency of taxi market in megacities (e.g., Beijing).",

For their importance, the two problems have been extensively studied recently in computational biology. Unfortunately both problems are NP-complete. Researchers have developed both fixed-parameter algorithms and approximation algorithms for the two problems. In terms of fixed-parameter, when the radius d is the parameter, the best-known fixed-parameter algorithm for closest string has time complexity O(ndd+1), which is still superpolynomial even if d = O(log n). In this paper we provide an O(n|\u03a3|O(d)) algorithm where \u03a3 is the alphabet. This gives a polynomial time algorithm when d = O(log n) and \u03a3 has constant size. Using the same technique, we additionally provide a more efficient subexponential time algorithm for the closest substring problem. In terms of approximation, both closest string and closest substring problems admit polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS). The best known time complexity of the PTAS is O(nO(\u0190-2 log 1/\u0190)). In this paper we present a PTAS with time complexity O(nO(\u0190-2)). At last, we prove that a restricted version of the closest substring has the same parameterized complexity as closest substring, answering an open question in the literature.",

        "abstract": "We consider the classic clique (or, equivalently, the independent set) problem in two settings. In the streaming model, edges are given one by one in an adversarial order, and the algorithm aims to output a good approximation under space restrictions. In the communication complexity setting, two players, each holds a graph on n vertices, and they wish to use a limited amount of communication to distinguish between the cases when the union of the two graphs has a low or a high clique number. The settings are related in that the communication complexity gives a lower bound on the space complexity of streaming algorithms. We give several results that illustrate different tradeoffs between clique separability and the required communication/space complexity under randomization. The main result is a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\frac{n^2}{r^2\\log^2{n}})$-space for any r-approximate randomized streaming algorithm for maximum clique. A simple random sampling argument shows that this is tight up to a logarithmic factor. For the case when r=o(logn), we present another lower bound of $\\Omega(\\frac{n^2}{r^4})$. In particular, it implies that any constant approximation randomized streaming algorithm requires \u03a9(n2) space, even if the algorithm runs in exponential time. Finally, we give a third lower bound that holds for the extremal case of s\u22121 vs. $\\mathcal{R}(s)-1$, where $\\mathcal{R}(s)$ is the s-th Ramsey number. This is the extremal setting of clique numbers that can be separated. The proofs involve some novel combinatorial structures and sophisticated combinatorial constructions.",

        "abstract": "The quantum query complexity of searching for local optima has been a subject of much interest in the recent literature. For the d-dimensional grid graphs, the complexity has been determined asymptotically for all fixed d \\geqslant 5, but the lower dimensional cases present special difficulties, and considerable gaps exist in our knowledge. In the present paper we present near-optimal lower bounds, showing that the quantum query complexity for the 2-dimensional grid [n]^2 is \\Omega \\left( {n^{1/2 - \\delta } } \\right), and that for the 3-dimensional grid [n]^3 is \\Omega (n^{1- \\delta } ), for any fixed \\delta \\ge 0. A general lower bound approach for this problem, initiated by Aaronson [1](based on Ambainis' adversary method [3] for quantum lower bounds), uses random walks with low collision probabilities. This approach encounters obstacles in deriving tight lower bounds in low dimensions due to the lack of degrees of freedom in such spaces. We solve this problem by the novel construction and analysis of random walks with non-uniform step lengths. The proof employs in a nontrivial way sophisticated results of Sarkozy and Szemeredi [14], Bose and Chowla [5], and Halasz [9] from combinatorial number theory, as well as less familiar probability tools like Esseen's Inequality.",

        "abstract": "We study the natural problem of secure n-party computation (in the computationally unbounded attack model) of circuits over an arbitrary finite non-Abelian group (G,\u00bf), which we call G-circuits. Besides its intrinsic interest, this problem is also motivating by a completeness result of Barrington, stating that such protocols can be applied for general secure computation of arbitrary functions. For flexibility, we are interested in protocols which only require black-box access to the group G (i.e. the only computations performed by players in the protocol are a group operation, a group inverse, or sampling a uniformly random group element). Our investigations focus on the passive adversarial model, where up to t of the n participating parties are corrupted.Our results are as follows. We initiate a novel approach for the construction of black-box protocols for G-circuits based on k-of-k threshold secret-sharing schemes, which are efficiently implementable over any black-box (non-Abelian) group G. We reduce the problem of constructing such protocols to a combinatorial coloring problem in planar graphs. We then give three constructions for such colorings. Our first approach leads to a protocol with optimal resilience t<n/2, but it requires exponential communication complexity $O({\\\\binom{2 t+1}{t}}^{2} \\\\cdot N_{g})$ group elements and round complexity $O(\\\\binom{2 t + 1}{t} \\\\cdot N_{g})$ , for a G-circuit of size N g . Nonetheless, using this coloring recursively, we obtain another protocol to t-privately compute G-circuits with communication complexity $\\\\mathcal{P}\\\\mathit{oly}(n)\\\\cdot N_{g}$ for any t\u00bfO(n 1\u00bf\u2208 ) where \u2208 is any positive constant. For our third protocol, there is a probability \u00bf (which can be made arbitrarily small) for the coloring to be flawed in term of security, in contrast to the first two techniques, where the colorings are always secure (we call this protocol probabilistic, and those earlier protocols deterministic). This third protocol achieves optimal resilience t<n/2. It has communication complexity O(n 5.056(n+log\u00bf\u00bf \u00bf1)2\u00bfN g ) and the number of rounds is O(n 2.528\u00bf(n+log\u00bf\u00bf \u00bf1)\u00bfN g ).",

Our lower bound is nearly tight, as Grover Search can be used to find a fixed point with O(n d/2) quantum queries. Our result establishes a nearly tight bound for the computation of d-dimensional approximate Brouwer fixed points defined by Scarf and by Hirsch, Papadimitriou, and Vavasis. It can be extended to the quantum model for Sperner\u2019s Lemma in any dimensions: The quantum query complexity of finding a panchromatic cell in a Sperner coloring of a triangulation of a d-dimensional simplex with n d cells is \u03a9(n (d\u22121)/2). For d=2, this result improves the bound of \u03a9(n 1/4) of Friedl, Ivanyos, Santha, and Verhoeven. More significantly, our result provides a quantum separation of local search and fixed point computation over [n]d , for d\u22654. Aaronson\u2019s local search algorithm for grid\u00a0[n]d , using Aldous Sampling and Grover Search, makes O(n d/3) quantum queries. Thus, the quantum query model over [n]d for d\u22654 strictly separates these two fundamental search problems.",

For\n the d-dimensional grid graphs, the complexity has been determined asymptotically for all fixed d\u22655, but the lower dimensional cases present special difficulties, and considerable gaps exist in our knowledge. In the present\n paper we present near-optimal lower bounds, showing that the quantum query complexity for the 2-dimensional grid [n]2 is \u03a9(n\n 1/2\u2212\u03b4\n ), and that for the 3-dimensional grid [n]3 is \u03a9(n\n 1\u2212\u03b4\n ), for any fixed \u03b4>0.\n \n A general lower bound approach for this problem, initiated by Aaronson (based on Ambainis\u2019 adversary method for quantum lower\n bounds), uses random walks with low collision probabilities. This approach encounters obstacles in deriving tight lower bounds\n in low dimensions due to the lack of degrees of freedom in such spaces.

Turan (1984) [7] initiated the study of sensitivity complexity for graph properties. He conjectured that for any non-trivial graph property on n vertices, the sensitivity complexity is at least n-1. He proved that it is greater than n/4 in his paper. Wegener (1985) [8] verified this conjecture for all monotone graph properties. Recently Sun (2011) [6] improved the lower bound to 617n for general graph properties. We follow their steps and investigate the sensitivity complexity of bipartite graph properties. In this paper we propose the following conjecture about the sensitivity of bipartite graph properties, which can be considered as the bipartite analogue of Turan's conjecture: for any non-trivial nxm bipartite graph property f, s(f)=max{@?n+1m+1m@?,@?m+1n+1n@?}. We prove this conjecture for all nx2 bipartite graph properties. For general nxm bipartite graph properties, we show a max{@?n/2@?,@?m/2@?} lower bound. We also prove this conjecture when the bipartite graph property can be written as a composite function.",

Theyconsidered the passive adversary model and they assumed that theparties were only allowed to perform black-box operations over thefinite group G .

We proposed two fast algorithms for MPEG-2 to H.264 transcoding in DCT domain. The first one synthesizes a H.264 integer DCT block for motion compensation from four intersected integer DCT blocks using only a few additions and shift operations. The second algorithm shows our rapid solution on dealing with the difference of scale in the integer DCT domain before and after the quantization procedure and replace the division operations with multiplications and shift operations. They are very useful in MPEG to H.264 DCT domain transcoder designing, especially for embedded RISC processors.",

        "title": "Generalized Tsirelson Inequalities, Commuting-Operator Provers, and Multi-prover Interactive Proof Systems",
        "abstract": "A central question in quantum information theory and computational complexity is how powerful nonlocal strategies are in cooperative games with imperfect information, such as multi-prover interactive proof systems. This paper develops a new method for proving limits of nonlocal strategies that make use of prior entanglement among players (or, provers, in the terminology of multi-prover interactive proofs). Instead of proving the limits for usual isolated provers who initially share entanglement, this paper proves the limits for \"commuting-operator provers\", who share private space, but can apply only such operators that are commutative with any operator applied by other provers. Obviously, these commuting-operator provers are at least as powerful as usual isolated but prior-entangled provers, and thus, limits in the model with commuting-operator provers immediately give limits in the usual model with prior-entangled provers. Using this method, we obtain an n-party generalization of the Tsirelson bound for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, for every n. Our bounds are tight in the sense that, in every n-party case, the equality is achievable by a usual nonlocal strategy with prior entanglement. We also apply our method to a three-prover one-round binary interactive proof system for NEXP. Combined with the technique developed by Kempe, Kobayashi, Matsumoto, Toner and Vidick to analyze the soundness of the proof system, it is proved to be NP-hard to distinguish whether the entangled value of a three-prover one-round binary-answer game is equal to one or at most 1-1/p(n) for some polynomial p, where n is the number of questions. This is in contrast to the two-prover one-round binary-answer case, where the corresponding problem is efficiently decidable. Alternatively, NEXP has a three-prover one-round binary interactive proof system with perfect completeness and soundness 1-2^{-poly}.",

The following problem was studied in\u00a0[1]: How many binary gates are needed to compute a ternary function f:({0,1}\n w\n )3\u2192{0,1}\n w\n . They proved that (2\u2009+\u2009o(1))2\n w\n  binary gates are enough for any ternary function, and there exists a ternary function which requires word circuits of size\n (1\u2009\u2212\u2009o(1))2\n w\n . One of the open problems in\u00a0[1] is to get these bounds tight within a low order term. In this paper we solved this problem\n by constructing new word circuits for ternary functions of size (1\u2009+\u2009o(1))2\n w\n .

        "abstract": "Several variations of hat guessing games have been popularly discussed in recreational mathematics. In a typical hat guessing game, after initially coordinating a strategy, each of n players is assigned a hat from a given color set. Simultaneously, each player tries to guess the color of his/her own hat by looking at colors of hats worn by other players. In this paper, we consider a new variation of this game, in which we require at least k correct guesses and no wrong guess for the players to win the game, but they can choose to \"pass\". A strategy is called perfect if it can achieve the simple upper bound n/n+k of the winning probability. We present sufficient and necessary condition on the parameters n and k for the existence of perfect strategy in the hat guessing games. In fact for any fixed parameter k, the existence of a perfect strategy for (n, k) is open for only a few values of n. In our construction we introduce a new notion: (d1, d2)-regular partition of the boolean hypercube, which is worth to study in its own right. For example, it is related to the k-dominating set of the hypercube. It also might be interesting in coding theory. The existence of (d1, d2)- regular partition is explored in the paper and the existence of perfect k-dominating set follows as a corollary.",

        "abstract": "Despite the large amount of work on solving graph problems in the data stream model, there do not exist tight space bounds for almost any of them, even in a stream with only edge insertions. For example, for testing connectivity, the upper bound is O(n * log(n)) bits, while the lower bound is only Omega(n) bits. We remedy this situation by providing the first tight Omega(n * log(n)) space lower bounds for randomized algorithms which succeed with constant probability in a stream of edge insertions for a number of graph problems. Our lower bounds apply to testing bipartiteness, connectivity, cycle-freeness, whether a graph is Eulerian, planarity, H-minor freeness, finding a minimum spanning tree of a connected graph, and testing if the diameter of a sparse graph is constant. We also give the first Omega(n * k * log(n)) space lower bounds for deterministic algorithms for k-edge connectivity and k-vertex connectivity; these are optimal in light of known deterministic upper bounds (for k-vertex connectivity we also need to allow edge duplications, which known upper bounds allow). Finally, we give an Omega(n * log^2(n)) lower bound for randomized algorithms approximating the minimum cut up to a constant factor with constant probability in a graph with integer weights between 1 and n, presented as a stream of insertions and deletions to its edges. This lower bound also holds for cut sparsifiers, and gives the first separation of maintaining a sparsifier in the data stream model versus the offline model.",

One of the core operations of elliptic curve cryptography protocols is the scalar multiplication. Any algorithm reducing the complexity of such multiplications will speed up cryptographic primitives based on these algebraic structures. In this paper, we study two recently introduced techniques for scalar multiplication: Double-Base Number System (DBNS) and Double-Base Chain (DBC). Our results are twofold. First, we demonstrate a theoretical bound @W(logn) on the length of any DBC used to decompose some (logn)-bit integers. Second, we present a new algorithm to obtain a {2,3}-integer expansion of n. The bound previously computed will imply the optimality of this algorithm. Our scheme represents a trade-off method between the DBNS approach and the DBC technique. Experimentally, our algorithm constructs shorter chains on average than both the binary/ternary method and the greedy algorithm approach.",

For the d-dimensional grid graphs, the complexity has been determined asymptotically for all fixed d\u22655, but the lower dimensional cases present special difficulties, and considerable gaps exist in our knowledge. In the present paper we present near-optimal lower bounds, showing that the quantum query complexity for the 2-dimensional grid [n]2 is \u03a9(n 1/2\u2212\u03b4 ), and that for the 3-dimensional grid [n]3 is \u03a9(n 1\u2212\u03b4 ), for any fixed \u03b40. A general lower bound approach for this problem, initiated by Aaronson (based on Ambainis\u2019 adversary method for quantum lower bounds), uses random walks with low collision probabilities. This approach encounters obstacles in deriving tight lower bounds in low dimensions due to the lack of degrees of freedom in such spaces. We solve this problem by the novel construction and analysis of random walks with non-uniform step lengths. The proof employs in a nontrivial way sophisticated results of S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy and Szemer\u00e9di, Bose and Chowla, and Hal\u00e1sz from combinatorial number theory, as well as less familiar probability tools like Esseen\u2019s Inequality.",

In particular, we prove that the n-vertexScorpion graph property has quantum query complexity\\widetilde\\Theta (n^{1/2}), which implies that the minimum quantumcomplexity for graph properties is strictly less than thatfor monotone graph properties (known to be \\widetilde\\Theta (n^{2/3})). Adirected graph property, SINK, is also shown to have the\\widetilde\\Theta (n^{1/2}) quantum query complexity. Furthermore, we givean N-ary circular function which has the quantum querycomplexity \\widetilde\\Theta (n^{1/4}). Finally, we show that for any permutationgroup \u9a74, as long as \u9a74 is transitive, the quantumquery complexity of any function invariant to \u9a74 is at least\\widetilde\\Theta (n^{1/4}), which implies that our examples are (almost) thebest ones in the sense of pinning down the complexity forthe corresponding permutation group.",

To solve this problem a new scheme of inserting synchronous back-to-back PPM symbols to the PPM sequence at intervals of certain symbols is presented, the synchronization signal is obtained by searching for the synchronous symbols, and the corresponding digital logic circuit is presented too.

The SER calculating formula of single input single output (SISO)-PPM systems is derived firstly, then as a benchmark, under the cases of both independent with identical distribution (IID) and independent with different distributions(IDD), the average slot error rates (SER) of MISO-PPM, SIMO-PPM and MIMO-PPM systems are derived respectively. Simulations of the average SER performances of these systems are done. The simulation results show that, under Gamma-Gamma distribution, the average SER is indeed improved in MIMO systems. When SER is at 10 -4, the average SER of the MIMO-PPM system with M=2 and N=2 is improved by about 50 dB and 65 dB under IID and IDD respectively. In practical designs, M and N are enough to set to 3 or 4 respectively. The obtained conclusion is significant to the analysis and design of FSO systems.",

These caps had three-dimensional caved structures with ultrathin branches, as evidenced by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and HAADF-STEM characterization. Tuning the reduction kinetics of two metal precursors by an iodide ion was believed to be the key for the formation of an alloyed nanostructure. Electro-oxidation of methanol and formic acid showed dramatically improved electrocatalytic activities and poison-tolerance for these nanoalloys as compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts, which was attributed to their unique open porous structure with interconnected network, ultrahigh surface areas, as well as synergetic effect of the two metallic components.",

VO2(B) nanobelts with different size were prepared by hydrothermal reaction with various amount of formic acid addition. The phase structure and morphology were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, which revealed high crystallinity and homogeneous morphology. A constant current charge-discharge test was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties. These films exhibited initial specific capacity of 219.4 mAh/g at current density of 10mA/g in the voltage range 4.0-1.5V vs. Li+/Li. Distinct voltage plateaus around 2.5V were observed, which was seldom reported. The size effect of the materials on electrochemical performance was investigated and the results demonstrated that the electrochemical performance of the VO2(B) nanobelts is significantly impacted by their size. \u00a9 2011 by ESG.",

        "title": "Porous ZnAl2O4 synthesized by a modified citrate technique",
        "abstract": "A modified citrate precursor technique is proposed for the preparation of porous ZnAl 2 O 4 . In this technique, ZnAl 2 O 4 was obtained by calcination of a citrate precursor in N 2 (0.5% O 2 ) at 800 \u00b0C, followed by annealing in air at 400 \u00b0C. The ZnAl 2 O 4 sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, transition electron microscopy and surface area analyses (BET method), and the results showed that the ZnAl 2 O 4 had a high surface area of 230 m 2 /g and controllable particle size from 5 nm to 20 nm. A Pd/ZnAl 2 O 4 catalyst prepared based on the porous ZnAl 2 O 4 shows good catalytic activity, indicating that ZnAl 2 O 4 as prepared is a promising catalyst support material. Keywords Porous material Citrate Catalytic properties 1 Introduction ZnAl 2 O 4 possesses a unique combination of desirable properties such as high thermal stability, high mechanical resistance, low temperature sinterability, better diffusion and ductility and low surface acidity. Due to these properties, it was used as high temperature material [1] , catalyst, catalyst support [2,3] and optical coating [4\u20136] , but most importantly as catalyst or catalyst support. It was widely used in many catalytic reactions, such as synthesis [7] , dehydration [8] , hydrogenation [9] and dehydrogenation [10] . Zinc aluminate catalysts or supports are commonly prepared by high temperature calcinations of mixed aluminium and zinc oxides [11] , coprecipitated products [12] or products obtained by impregnating porous alumina having a high surface area with a solution of a zinc compound [13,14] . A disadvantage of such materials for catalytic applications is the low surface area, usually about 20\u201350 m 2 /g [15] , whereas conventional catalyst or supports are porous materials whose surface area is required to lie between 100 and 300 m 2 /g. Therefore, a new and inexpensive method to produce porous ZnAl 2 O 4 with a narrow size distribution and larger specific surface area is necessary. One method to prepare porous material is the sol\u2013gel technique [16,17] . However, the need to synthesize and handle the costly metal-organic precursors in the sol\u2013gel procedure seems inconvenient and also not economically acceptable. In the present paper a modified citrate precursor technique is proposed for the preparation of high surface area porous ZnAl 2 O 4 . A schematic diagram ( Fig. 1 ) may represent the probable course of the formation of ZnAl 2 O 4 powders. The products were characterized by XRD, TEM, and by an N 2 porosimeter. A few selected properties of the Pd/ZnAl 2 O 4 catalyst prepared based on the porous ZnAl 2 O 4 were also studied. 2 Experimental Zn(NO 3 ) 2 (AR), Al(NO 3 ) 3 (AR) and citric acid(AR) are used as starting materials. Initially, 0.01 molar Zn(NO 3 ) 2 and 0.02 M Al(NO 3 ) 3 were dissolved in 100 ml deionized water to obtain a metal nitrate solution. Then citric acid was added, the molar ratio(R) of citric acid and the metal ions being 2:1. After 10 min stirring, the solution was heated to evaporate the water for several hours in 70 \u00b0C water-bath, the resultant complex solutions became lightly yellow transparent viscous sols. Yellow gels were obtained by evaporating several more hours. The gels were then dried for 2 h at 140\u2013180 \u00b0C to obtain a fluffy powder, namely the citrate precursor of ZnAl 2 O 4 . After grinding, the precursors were heated in N 2 (0.5% O 2 ) at 800 \u00b0C to obtain a black amorphous mixture. Then the mixture was annealed in air at 400 \u00b0C for 3 h to obtain the ZnAl 2 O 4 powder. The resulting powders were denoted as ZnAl 2 O 4 (MC). In an attempt to control the native grain size of the oxides, several experiments were conducted by varying the ratio ( R ) of the citric acid to the cation and by varying the annealing temperatures. A porous ZnAl 2 O 4 supported Pd catalyst was prepared by a conventional impregnation method [18] . A Pd(NO 3 ) 2 solution was used as a precursor. The palladium loading was 1 wt.%. After evaporation, the catalysts were dried at 100 \u00b0C for 12 h and calcined at 400 \u00b0C in air for 6 h. Catalytic combustion of propylene and CO over Pd/ZnAl 2 O 4 catalysts was carried out in a conventional flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. Granular catalysts were fixed in a quartz tube by packing alumina beads at both ends of the catalyst bed. A gaseous mixture of propylene (0.1%), O 2 (3%), CO (1.0%), and N 2 (95.9%) was supplied at a space velocity of 100,000 h \u22121 . The temperature inside the reactor was increased continuously from 50 to 300 \u00b0C at a rate of 2 \u00b0C/min. The composition of the gas in the reactor was monitored by gas chromatography. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were measured on a Bruker D8-advance X-ray K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb=1.5418 A \u030a ). The operation voltage and current are 40 kV and 40 mA. XRD data were recorded with a resolution of 0.02\u00b0 and a scan rate of 0.3 s per point. TEM images were taken with a Hitachi Model-800 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The surface area and porosity of the samples were determined by application of the Dubinin method, from nitrogen absorption data obtained at low temperature (77 K) by a standard volumetric procedure, using a sorptomatic 1900 FISONS equipment. 3 Results and discussion The citrate precursor technique has been widely used to synthesize nanometered oxide for its many advantages such as homogenous mixing of the components on an atomic scale, good control of the stoichiometry, easily operation, and relatively cheap reagents. [17] . In this technique, the precursor of the metal oxide is directly calcinated in air and decomposed as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water and metal oxide [19] in the presence of O 2 , as in Fig. 1 . Due to the fact that the oxidation of the organic compound is out of control, the organic compound is burning heavily and accompanied by much heat, which causes locally a high temperature. So the particles are usually big in size and there are considerable agglomerates in the products. However, in our method the precursors formed by the modified citrate route decompose as carbon, some carbon monoxide, water and amorphous metal oxide [20] , because the precursors heated in a nitrogen atmosphere. Due to the absence of O 2 , the carbon is not oxidized. The remaining carbon prevents completion of the reaction to ZnAl 2 O 4 by increasing the diffusion distance of the mixed cations. This retards the crystallization of ZnAl 2 O 4 , especially for a precursor with a high ratio of citric acid to metal. In the following heat-treatment, the carbon is oxidized softly in air at a low temperature and the crystallization of ZnAl 2 O 4 is completed. At the same time the pores are formed by combustion of the carbon surrounding the amorphous ZnAl 2 O 4 , as in Fig. 1 . The following scheme [21] represents a probable course of the formation of the ZnAl 2 O 4 powder: Zn 3 Al 6 ( C 6 H 5 O 7 ) 8 \u00b7n H 2 O \u2192 25\u2013220 \u00b0 C , air Zn 3 Al 6 ( C 6 H 5 O 7 ) 8 +n H 2 O \u2191 Zn 3 Al 6 ( C 6 H 5 O 7 ) 8 \u2192 220\u2013260 \u00b0 C , air Zn 3 Al 6 ( C 6 H 3 O 6 ) 8 +8 H 2 O \u2191 Zn 3 Al 6 ( C 6 H 3 O 6 ) 8 \u2192 260\u2013800 \u00b0 C , N 2 3( ZnAl 2 O 4 )\u00b7x C +y CO \u2191+z CO 2 \u2191+12 H 2 O \u2191(x+y+z=48) 3( ZnAl 2 O 4 )\u00b7x C +x O 2 \u2192 400 \u00b0 C , air ZnAl 2 O 4 +x CO 2 \u2191. For the sake of comparison, ZnAl 2 O 4 samples were also prepared by the conventional citrate precursor technique [22] . In this technique, the citrate precursor of ZnAl 2 O 4 was directly heated in air. The powders as synthesized are denoted as ZnAl 2 O 4 (CC). The as synthesized samples were also characterized and compared with those synthesized by the modified citrate technique. Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of the ZnAl 2 O 4 (CC) powders. It is clear from the spectra that the ZnAl 2 O 4 phase has not yet formed after heating at 600 \u00b0C for 3 h in air, as indicated by the amorphous nature of the precursors. As we go from a heating temperature of 600\u2013700 and 900 \u00b0C, we obtain complete formation of the ZnAl 2 O 4 phase. However, the sharp peaks for the as prepared ZnAl 2 O 4 indicate high crystallinity and large particle size (over 50 nm). This result shows that the particle size of the sample synthesized by the conventional citrate method is uncontrollable. Fig. 3 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples with different ratios only heated in N 2 (0.5%O 2 ) at 800 \u00b0C for 1 h. No peaks corresponding to ZnAl 2 O 4 are present. A small amount of ZnAl 2 O 4 is present in the sample with the ratio of R =1, indicating the start of the ZnAl 2 O 4 crystallization. These results show that the citrate precursor decomposed as amorphous mixture under the given condition, the high amount of citric acid retarding the crystallization of ZnAl 2 O 4 . Figs. 4 and 5 show XRD patterns of the ZnAl 2 O 4 (MC) powders. All reflections correspond to those of ZnAl 2 O 4 and are indexed in the figures. It was found that the peak widths decrease slightly with increasing temperature or with decreasing R . The crystallite sizes were calculated from the half-width of the (3 1 1) diffraction peak using Scherrer\u2019s formula [23] . These data are listed in Table 1 . Compared with the ZnAl 2 O 4 (CC) powders, the ZnAl 2 O 4 (MC) powders have smaller and controllable particle sizes. The shapes of the ZnAl 2 O 4 particles prepared by the two methods were determined by TEM ( Fig. 6a\u2013c ). From the images we derived that in the ZnAl 2 O 4 (CC) powders, there are many thick agglomerates consisting of big particles, and there are no pores in the agglomerates. However, in the ZnAl 2 O 4 (MC) powders, only a few originate particles have combined to small agglomerates. The originate particles are \u223c10 nm, in good agreement with the XRD patterns. Moreover, on the surface of the agglomerates, there are many small pores. The BET pore size distribution confirms this observation, which we will describe later. Fig. 7a shows the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm for a ZnAl 2 O 4 sample with an R of two annealed at 400 \u00b0C for 3 h in air. This sample has the highest surface area (230 m 2 /g). The curves are of typical for type IV (according to IUPAC classification), which is characteristic of inorganic porous oxides [24] . A hysteresis loop with a sloping adsorption branch and a relatively sharp steep desorption branch is observed at relative high pressure ( P =0.4\u20130.6 P 0 ). It is well known that a distribution of cavities of various sizes but with the same diameter could give this type of hysteresis loop. The pore size distributions were obtained according to the Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda (BJH) method using the Halsey equation for multilayer thickness [25] . These are shown in Fig. 7 . We can find that the peak is in the mesoporous range, with a narrow peak around 36 \u00c5. The micropore volume is 0.21 cm 3 /g while the total pore volume (at P / P 0 =0.97) is 0.22 cm 3 /g. The ZnAl 2 O 4 powder annealed at 800 \u00b0C for 4 h still has the high surface area of 90 m 2 /g. Usually powders with high surface area are expected to be good catalyst supports. Due to their high surface area, the ZnAl 2 O 4 (MC) powders may qualify in this respect. So we studied a Pd/ ZnAl 2 O 4 catalyst prepared from the porous ZnAl 2 O 4 . Fig. 6d shows the TEM micrograph of Pd/ZnAl 2 O 4 . From the image, one can not distinguish the Pd particles from the support. So EDS of the synthesized Pd/ZnAl 2 O 4 was carried out in order to analyze the type of metal. Fig. 6e shows a peak in the element spectrum representing palladium metal. The surface area of Pd/ ZnAl 2 O 4 has hardly changed compared with the pure ZnAl 2 O 4 support. The catalytic activity of Pd/ZnAl 2 O 4 was investigated at a temperature of 100\u2013250 \u00b0C. The curves showing C 3 H 6 and CO conversion of Pd/ZnAl 2 O 4 as a function of increasing reaction temperature (1 K/min) are given in Fig. 8 . The conversions of C 3 H 6 and CO started at about 155 \u00b0C, and increased rapidly with increasing reaction temperature. Conversions of 100% could be obtained above 180 \u00b0C. It is well known that the dispersion of the noble metals usually affects the catalytic activity. Possibly due to the high surface area and the high dispersion of Pd, the 100% conversion temperature of the as prepared Pd/ZnAl 2 O 4 was lower compared to that of other materials supporting Pd catalysts [26] . This indicates that porous ZnAl 2 O 4 is promising for catalyst support material. 4 Conclusions Porous ZnAl 2 O 4 spinel has been successfully prepared by a modified citrate precursor technique. XRD analyses show that the average particle size of the products can be manipulated in the range of 5\u201320 nm by controlling the ratio of citrate acid to metal cations and/or the annealing temperature. TEM and N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption revealed that the material possesses a mesoporous structure and a very high surface area (230 m 2 /g). These properties of ZnAl 2 O 4 as synthesized make it a promising material for use in the development of catalyst carriers. A Pd/ZnAl 2 O 4 catalyst prepared from the porous ZnAl 2 O 4 possesses good catalytic activity which further indicates that ZnAl 2 O 4 as prepared is a promising catalyst support material.

It is found that the bifurcation point is 146 kJ mol-1, close to the theoretical calculation barrier and the experimental apparent activation barrier. Then adding a stochastic component to activation energy leads to a broader range of parameters that support oscillation, a form of fluctuation-driven oscillation (FDO).

Composition investigations on these size-sorted nanosheets indicated that larger sheets had higher Mg:Al ratio than the smaller ones. Experiments using different Mg:Al feed ratios confirmed that high Mg:Al ratio induced fast sheet growth speed. Tracking the source of the Mg:Al spatial distribution difference in one batch of synthesis at the nucleation process revealed the coprecipitation-redissolution of Mg(2+). Thus the discriminative separation of these nanosheets led to a new insight into the structure-composition relationship of LDH nanomaterials and more understanding on their formation mechanism.",

        "abstract": "The performances of pseudocapacitors usually depend heavily on their hierarchical architectures and composition. Herein, we report a three-dimensional hierarchical NiAl layered double hydroxide/multiwalled carbon nanotube/nickel foam (NiAl-LDH/MWCNT/NF) electrode prepared by a facile three-step fabrication method: in situ hydrothermal growth of NiAl-LDH film on a Ni foam, followed by direct chemical vapor deposition growth of dense MWCNTs onto the NiAl-LDH film, and finally the growth of NiAl-LDH onto the surface of the MWCNTs via an in situ hydrothermal process in the presence of surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate. The MWCNT surface was fully covered by NiAl-LDH hexagonal platelets, and this hierarchical architecture led to a much enhanced capacitance. The NiAl-LDH/MWCNT/NF electrode has an areal loading mass of 5.8 mg of LDH per cm(2) of MWCNT/NF surface. It also possesses exceptional areal capacitance (7.5 F cm(-2)), specific capacitance (1293 F g(-1)), and cycling stability (83% of its initial value was preserved after 1000 charge-discharge cycles). The NiAl-LDH/MWCNT/NF material is thus a highly promising electrode with potential applications in electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Parameters such as solution concentrations and composition of the ambient atmosphere are known to be important in phase and morphology control in the solvothermal synthesis of CdS semiconductor nanorods (NRs), but a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved is lacking. In this work, a series of experiments were performed to demonstrate that the key factor affecting the phase and morphology of CdS NRs is the amount of O(2) in the space above the reaction solution in the sealed vessel relative to the amount of precursors in solution: O(2)-depleted conditions resulted in more cubic phase CdS and thick polycrystalline NRs with an aspect ratio usually less than 3, which have small blue shifts in band-edge emission and little surface trap emission, while O(2)-rich conditions resulted in more hexagonal-phase CdS and slim single-crystal NRs, which have significantly blue shifted band-edge emission and relatively strong surface trap emission. Thus, increasing the amount of solution in the vessel, changing the ambient atmosphere from air to N(2), and increasing the reagent concentration all lower the molar ratio of O(2) to reagents and lead to more cubic phase and thicker NRs. The results indicate that the composition of the \"empty\" section of the reaction vessel plays as important a role as the composition of the liquid in determining the phase and morphology, something that has been overlooked in earlier work. A mechanism to explain the effect of oxygen on the nucleation and growth stages has been proposed on the basis of those results and further supported by shaking experiments and ZnS NR synthesis manipulation. The CdS NRs synthesized under different conditions showed obvious differences in photocatalytic activity, which indicated that controlling the synthetic process can lead to materials with tailored photocatalytic activity.",

In addition to extending the range of colloidal systems which can be separated and providing monodisperse samples that cannot be obtained by synthesis optimization alone, this method simplifies the postsynthesis treatment process and facilitates subsequent bulk assembly of the monodisperse colloids. Dissolution of organic polymers in the gradient medium both enhances the separation efficiency and also allows the direct fabrication of functional composite films with discrete monodisperse nanoparticles embedded inside.",

        "abstract": "Thiosulfate (S 2 O 3 2\u2212 ) is the main impurity in ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4 SCN) extracted from the effluent from industries such as electroplating or mining. It significantly lowers the quality of NH 4 SCN. Here we report a method for selective removal of S 2 O 3 2\u2212 from aqueous solutions containing thiocyanate (SCN \u2212 ) using the material produced by calcination of MgAl\u2013CO 3 hydrotalcites also known as layered double hydroxides (LDHs). The calcined materials, which we denote CLDHs, are well known scavengers for anionic contaminants. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) showed that CLDH exhibits selectivity in adsorption between S 2 O 3 2\u2212 and SCN \u2212 anions, with preferential adsorption of S 2 O 3 2\u2212 anions resulting in S 2 O 3 2\u2212 -intercalated MgAl\u2013LDHs. Selective removal of S 2 O 3 2\u2212 from an aqueous mixed solution lowered the ratio of S 2 O 3 2\u2212 :SCN \u2212 from 1:1 to approximately 1:7, which meets the requirements for production of high quality NH 4 SCN after recrystallization, or for direct reuse in the industrial process which produced the original effluent. At the same time, the by-product, S 2 O 3 2\u2212 -intercalated MgAl\u2013LDH showed satisfactory S 2 O 3 2\u2212 -release behavior in a simulated solution, showing that is a potential slow-release sulfur fertilizer. Furthermore, its alkaline nature allows it to act as an effective acid soil conditioner. In this way, waste effluent posing an environmental hazard can be converted into two valuable products by a simple and economical process.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing the capacity and selectivity of adsorbent materials was critical for removing the sulfur-containing pollutants from industrial effluents and fuels. CO 3 2- and dodecylsulfate intercalated ZnAl layered double hydroxides (denoted as CO 3-LDH and DDS-LDH, respectively) were used as functional adsorbents for thiophene removal, and they show better absorption properties. The adsorption behavior of thiophene on them was significantly different. The first difference focused on pH dependence. The adsorption behavior onto CO 3-LDH was obviously influenced by initial pH; the removal percentage of thiophene reached a maximum value at pH \u223c7. However, the adsorption capacity of DDS-LDH was influenced indistinctively by initial pH and the removal percentage of thiophene was practically constant at various pH. The second difference was the effect of initial thiophene concentration. As the thiophene concentration increased, the curve of adsorption capacity became S-type onto CO 3-LDH but linear onto DDS-LDH, indicating two different adsorption processes. The adsorption behavior for DDS-LDH was proposed by the dissolution of thiophene in a three-dimensional hydrophobic interlayer region (i.e., adsolubilization), induced by the intercalated DDS, rather than a simple surface adsorption. The results suggested that DDS-LDH could be applied as a potential adsorbent for thiophene removal in a wide range of pH. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

The reduction in cationic precursors of rubrene+ by Ag atoms generated neutral rubrene molecules which had a local high concentration to realize the site-specific nucleation, and followed by the in situ growth of rubrene shell. The rubrene shell thickness can be highly tuned from 2 to 16 nm by adjusting the amount of rubrene+ radical cations. Such core-shell nanostructures have significant integrated multiple enhanced optical signal outputs: thickness-dependent fluorescence and SERS signals. The results show that the shell thickness and the match of local surface plasmon resonance and the excitation band of rubrene played dominant roles in fluorescence enhancement. Additionally, these nanostructures integrating the Raman-active substrate with Ag colloidal nanoparticles could obtain an enhancement factor (EF) of \u223c103. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

        "abstract": "Titanate nanosheets (TiO-NS) and nanotubes (TiO-NT) were prepared under hydrothermal or solvothermal conditions in varied alkali solutions following similar procedures. Relatively low alkalinity (5M NaOH) was associated with TiO-NS, but high alkalinity (10M) resulted in TiO-NT. Addition of low-boiling point organic solvents could increase the reproducibility of TiO-NT, and sometimes lower the alkalinity needed for nanotubes formation. The two nanomaterials were used to load Pd nanoparticles to study their morphology-dependence as catalyst supports. The Pd-loaded titanate nanosheets (Pd/TiO-NS) showed higher activity than the Pd-loaded nanotubes (Pd/TiO-NT) in CO catalytic oxidation reactions. High resolution transmission electronic micrography (HRTEM) revealed much better dispersion of the supported Pd nanoparticles on nanosheets than nanotubes. The better catalytic performance of Pd/TiO-NS was believed to be related to less aggregation of the Pd nanoparticles on TiO-NS. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

However, concerns about the potential toxicity of single-walled carbon nanotubes have been raised13, 14. Here we examine the acute and chronic toxicity of functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes when injected into the bloodstream of mice. Survival, clinical and laboratory parameters reveal no evidence of toxicity over 4 months. Upon killing, careful necropsy and tissue histology show age-related changes only. Histology and Raman microscopic mapping demonstrate that functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes persisted within liver and spleen macrophages for 4 months without apparent toxicity. Although this is a preliminary study with a small group of animals, our results encourage further confirmation studies with larger groups of animals.",

Here, quasi zero-dimensional SWNTs with finite lengths down to the molecular scale (7.5 nm in average) were obtained by length separation using a density gradient ultracentrifugation method. Different sedimentation rates of nanotubes with different lengths in a density gradient were taken advantage of to sort SWNTs according to length. Optical experiments on the SWNT fractions revealed that the UV-vis-NIR absorption and photoluminescence peaks of the ultrashort SWNTs blue-shift up to approximately 30 meV compared to long nanotubes, owing to quantum confinement effects along the length of ultrashort SWNTs. These nanotube capsules essentially correspond to SWNT quantum dots.",

The first samples of pristine graphene were obtained by 'peeling off' and epitaxial growth. Recently, the chemical reduction of graphite oxide was used to produce covalently functionalized single-layer graphene oxide. However, chemical approaches for the large-scale production of highly conducting graphene sheets remain elusive. Here, we report that the exfoliation-reintercalation-expansion of graphite can produce high-quality single-layer graphene sheets stably suspended in organic solvents. The graphene sheets exhibit high electrical conductance at room and cryogenic temperatures. Large amounts of graphene sheets in organic solvents are made into large transparent conducting films by Langmuir-Blodgett assembly in a layer-by-layer manner. The chemically derived, high-quality graphene sheets could lead to future scalable graphene devices.",

The electrostatic interactions between Au nanoparticles would be affected and cause 1D assembly upon passing through the salt layer. A negatively charged polymer such as poly(acrylic acid) was used as an encapsulation/stabilization layer to help the formation of 1D Au assemblies, which were subsequently sorted according to unit numbers at succeeding separation zones. A centrifugal field was introduced as the external field to overcome the random Brownian motion of NPs and benefit the assembly effect. Such a facile \"one-tube synthesis\" approach couples assembly and separation in one centrifuge tube by centrifuging once. The method can be tuned by changing the concentration of interference salt layer, encapsulation layer, and centrifugation rate. Furthermore, positively charged fluorescent polymers such as perylenediimide-poly(N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate) could encapsulate the assemblies to give tunable fluorescence properties.",

        "abstract": "Mg(OH) 2 nanorods have been successfully prepared via the hydrolysis of MgSO 4 in aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution under hydrothermal conditions. Subsequent thermal decomposition of the as-prepared Mg(OH) 2 nanorods produced MgO nanorods due to shape memory. The morphologies of the resultant Mg(OH) 2 nanocrystallites were monitored at different periods of the hydrothermal process, which clearly revealed the formation process of the Mg(OH) 2 nanorods. The morphology of the MgO product, as a dehydrated product of the rod-like Mg(OH) 2 nanorods, remained similar to its precursor, Mg(OH) 2 . The reported method is low cost, simple and environmentally benign, thus it should be relatively easy to be scaled up for industrial production.",

Here we show that NiO nanorod arrays on Ni foam\n have a combination of ultrahigh specific capacitance (2018 F/g at 2.27 A/g), high power density (1536 F/g at 22.7 A/g), and\n good cycling stability (only 8% of capacitance was lost in the first 100 cycles with no further change in the subsequent 400\n cycles). This resulted in an improvement in the reversible capacitance record for NiO by 50% or more, reaching 80% of the\n theoretical value, and demonstrated that a three-dimensional regular porous array structure can afford all of these virtues\n in a supercapacitor. The excellent performance can be attributed to the slim (< 20 nm) rod morphology, high crystallinity,\n regularly aligned array structure and strong bonding of the nanorods to the metallic Ni substrate, as revealed by scanning\n electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).",

Herein, we show how structural and kinetic factors govern the tendency for anisotropic growth of such materials under hydrothermal conditions, and how the crystal structure and morphology influence the optical properties of Ln3+-doped nanocrystals. The synthesis of phase-pure and single-crystalline monoclinic, hexagonal, and tetragonal one-dimensional LnPO4 nanostructures of different aspect ratios by means of kinetically controlled hydrothermal growth processes is demonstrated. It is shown that the tendency for anisotropic growth under hydrothermal conditions can be enhanced simply by modifying the chemical potentials of species in the reaction solution through the use of carefully selected chelating ligands. A systematic study of the photoluminescence of various Eu3+-doped lanthanide phosphates has revealed that the optical properties of these nanophosphors are strongly dependent on their crystal structures and morphologies.",

        "abstract": "Mg/Al-CO3 Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) nanorings with a 750 nm exterior diameter and 250 nm interior diameter were synthesized in an organic/water solvent system via a urea hydrolysis method, using Mg 10(OH)18Cl2\u00b75H2O nanowires as precursors. X-Ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy clearly revealed the nanorings to comprise Mg/Al-CO3 LDH. The character of the precursor materials and the ratio of organic solvents to water used for reaction played crucial roles in determining the final ring-like morphology. A possible mechanism was proposed for the LDH nanoring formation. The unique LDH nanorings exposed a higher specific surface area and larger pore volume than plate-like and flower-like analogues, and thus were further explored for their catalytic activity using the Knoevenagel reaction between benzaldehyde and diethyl malonate as a probe reaction. The ring-like structure displayed a significantly enhanced catalytic performance above other analogues. This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Oriented dense thin films of CuZnAl-NO3 layered double hydroxide (CuZnAl-NO3 LDH) have been grown on the surface of copper foil by an in situ hydrothermal method with Cu substrate as Cu source, boehmite sol as Al source, and Zn(NO3)2 aqueous solution as Zn source. The structure and morphology of the as-prepared CuZnAl-NO3 LDH films were studied by X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, room temperature Fourier transform infrared spectra, and scanning electron microscopy analysis. The results showed that the [00l] direction (or ab plane) of CuZnAl-NO3 LDH platelets was parallel to the surface of the Cu substrate. By a facial immersion method, intercalation of laurate anions by ion exchange with the CuZnAl-NO3 LDH film precursors endowed hydrophobic properties on Cu substrate. Moreover, the corrosion behavior of the hydrophobic laurate intercalated LDH films was then investigated by detecting the contact angle, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance properties, which showed that the corrosion resistance of the pristine Cu was highly improved due to the \"hydrophobic interaction\" and \"anion exchange\" effects. Therefore, this work provides an effective way to develop a new type of ternary LDH films with potential application as hydrophobic and long-term anticorrosive materials. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

The thickness of the amorphous SiO2 shell ranges from 10 to 30 nm, and increases with the concentration of the TEOS used. The photoluminescence intensity of the core-shell structures is enhanced for the CdS nanorod samples with only a thin layer (< 10 nm) of SiO2 shell on the CdS nanorod, and is reduced for the sample with a thicker SiO2 shell. Possible reasons contributing to the variations of the photoluminescence were discussed.",

Here, we investigate the biodistribution of radio-labelled SWNTs in mice by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET), ex vivo biodistribution and Raman spectroscopy. It is found that SWNTs that are functionalized with phospholipids bearing polyethylene-glycol (PEG) are surprisingly stable in vivo. The effect of PEG chain length on the biodistribution and circulation of the SWNTs is studied. Effectively PEGylated SWNTs exhibit relatively long blood circulation times and low uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Efficient targeting of integrin positive tumour in mice is achieved with SWNTs coated with PEG chains linked to an arginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartic acid (RGD) peptide. A high tumour accumulation is attributed to the multivalent effect of the SWNTs. The Raman signatures of SWNTs are used to directly probe the presence of nanotubes in mice tissues and confirm the radio-label-based results.",

        "abstract": "Size control of Au-Ni heteronanostructure in synthesis was systematically studied in this paper. Monodispersed Au-Ni spindly nanostructures were obtained through noble-metal-induced-reduction (NMIR) strategy. In a typical synthesis, 0.05 g of HAuCl4 and 0.25 g of Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O were added into 10 mL of octadecylamine (ODA) at 120\u00b0C. Then, the system was heated to 240\u00b0C; under this temperature, products were synthesized after 10 min of magnetic stirring. The products were collected by centrifugation and purified by washing with ethanol for several times. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) were applied to characterize the morphology and size of the as obtained heteronanostructures. Results indicated that the size of Ni tip would increase when the quantity of gold precursor was reduced, while the size of Au tip would not change; it might result from the unchanged temperature which kept the size of Au tip being the same, but comparatively more Ni precursor led to continuous growth on Au nanocrystals. Besides, halogen ions could also tune the size of Au-Ni tips by bring down the surface energy of noble metal nanocrystals, when bromide-ions-containing didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) was introduced to the system, Au particle in spindly nanostructures turned out to be smaller while the Ni size remained unchanged, and thus achieving the controllable regulation of both tips of the Au-Ni heteronanostructure under synthetic temperature of 240\u00b0C. To reducing both Au size and Ni size of the particles simultaneously, lower temperature in the initial reaction stage was used, but little rising of initial temperature did not produce remarkable changes of the size of Au-Ni heteronanostructure. This work not only provides a method for the size control of heteronanostructures, but also leads the material foundation for the further study of the catalytic performance of the Au-Ni bimetallic nanocrystals. \u00a9 2013 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

However, grid-scale freshwater electrolysis would put a heavy strain on vital water resources. Developing cheap electrocatalysts and electrodes that can sustain seawater splitting without chloride corrosion could address the water scarcity issue. Here we present a multilayer anode consisting of a nickel-iron hydroxide (NiFe) electrocatalyst layer uniformly coated on a nickel sulfide (NiSx) layer formed on porous Ni foam (NiFe/NiSx-Ni), affording superior catalytic activity and corrosion resistance in solar-driven alkaline seawater electrolysis operating at industrially required current densities (0.4 to 1 A/cm) over 1,000 h. A continuous, highly oxygen evolution reaction-active NiFe electrocatalyst layer drawing anodic currents toward water oxidation and an in situ-generated polyatomic sulfate and carbonate-rich passivating layers formed in the anode are responsible for chloride repelling and superior corrosion resistance of the salty-water-splitting anode.",

However, the activity and stability of single atoms and their interaction with support still remains a mystery. Here we show a stable single atomic ruthenium catalyst anchoring on the surface of cobalt iron layered double hydroxides, which possesses a strong electronic coupling between ruthenium and layered double hydroxides. With 0.45 wt.% ruthenium loading, the catalyst exhibits outstanding activity with overpotential 198\u2009mV at the current density of 10\u2009mA\u2009cm and a small Tafel slope of 39\u2009mV\u2009dec for oxygen evolution reaction. By using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, it is disclosed that the isolated single atom ruthenium was kept under the oxidation states of 4+ even at high overpotential due to synergetic electron coupling, which endow exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability simultaneously.",

The NR array electrode exhibits superior electroactivity for the oxidation of nitrite and the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. A wide linear response range (2 \u00d7 10-7-5 \u00d7 10-3 M), high sensitivity (135.36 \u03bcA mM-1 cm-2) and low detection limit (1 \u00d7 10-7 M) were obtained for the oxidation of nitrite. This \u03b1-Fe2O3 NR array electrode was further utilized in the detection of H2O2 with a detection limit of 2 \u00d7 10-7 M, linearity of 5 \u00d7 10-7-3 \u00d7 10-3 M and a sensitivity of 77.30 \u03bcA mM-1 cm-2. The stability and selectivity of the biosensor were also evaluated.

        "abstract": "High specific capacitance per area is a critical requirement for a practical supercapacitor electrode, and needs a combination of high mass-loading of the electrochemically active material per area, and high utilization efficiency of this material. However, pursuing high mass-loading on conventional electrodes usually leads to an increase in \"dead\" material which is not accessible to the electrolyte in the supercapacitor, and thus prevents high utilization efficiencies of the material being realized. Here we show that this antagonism can be overcome by incorporating the electrochemically active material in a mesoporous hierarchical architecture. Fabrication of ternary ordered hierarchical Co 3O 4@Ni-Co-O nanosheet-nanorod arrays-involving the growth of densely aligned slim Ni-Co-O nanorods (diameter <20 nm) on Co 3O 4 microsheets which had been previously loaded on macroporous nickel foam-gives a material with excellent electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode. At a current density of 5 mA/cm 2, the electrodes have both high mass loading per area (12 mg/cm 2) and high efficiency of 2098 F/g, giving specific capacitances per area as high as ~25 F/cm 2. When the current density was increased from 5 to 30 mA/cm 2, 72% of the specific capacitance was retained and, furthermore, no significant decrease in capacitance was observed over 1000 charge/discharge cycles. The combination of these merits makes the composite material an excellent candidate for practical application as a supercapacitor electrode and, more generally, highlights the increased efficacies of materials which can result from fabricating mesoporous hierarchical structures at the nanoscale. \u00a9 2012 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

While developing new catalysts is important, tuning the electronic structure of existing catalysts over a wide electrochemical potential range can also offer a new direction. Here we demonstrate a method for electrochemical lithium tuning of catalytic materials in organic electrolyte for subsequent enhancement of the catalytic activity in aqueous solution. By continuously extracting lithium ions out of LiCoO2, a popular cathode material in lithium ion batteries, to Li0.5CoO2 in organic electrolyte, the catalytic activity is significantly improved. This enhancement is ascribed to the unique electronic structure after the delithiation process. The general efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated in several mixed metal oxides with similar improvements. The electrochemically delithiated LiCo0.33Ni0.33Fe0.33O2 exhibits a notable performance, better than the benchmark iridium/carbon catalyst.",

        "abstract": "Construction of novel nanocrystal assemblies has attracted increasing interest in recent years. In this work, a general and facile ionic chelator-mediated hydrothermal method was developed to prepare one-dimensional (1D) rare earth orthovanadate (LnVO4, Ln = lanthanides) nanorod (NR) assemblies in an aqueous solution. The structure and morphology of the samples were characterized with XRD, TEM, and HRTEM. Particularly, the morphological evolution of CeVO4 nanocrystals involving the ionic chelator EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) in a hydrothermal reaction was investigated in detail. The effects of varying the EDTA/Ce3+ ratio, concentration of the reactants, pH value, growth time and reaction temperature were examined, which indicated that the self-assembly of LnVO4 NRs was realized in strictly confined synthetic conditions. The size of the nanorods in the array is controllable by tuning reaction parameters, which may benefit future applications. The formation mechanism was also investigated. Photoluminescence characterization showed that there is strong red emission from LaVO 4:Eu and yellowish-green light from LaVO4:Dy NR arrays under UV excitation, which broadens the range of possible applications for these materials. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Although biomedical applications of carbon nanotubes have been intensively studied in recent years, its sister, graphene, has been rarely explored in biomedicine. In this work, for the first time we study the in vivo behaviors of nanographene sheets (NGS) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating by a fluorescent labeling method. In vivo fluorescence imaging reveals surprisingly high tumor uptake of NGS in several xenograft tumor mouse models. Distinctive from PEGylated carbon nanotubes, PEGylated NGS shows several interesting in vivo behaviors including highly efficient tumor passive targeting and relatively low retention in reticuloendothelial systems. We then utilize the strong optical absorbance of NGS in the near-infrared (NIR) region for in vivo photothermal therapy, achieving ultraefficient tumor ablation after intravenous administration of NGS and low-power NIR laser irradiation on the tumor. Furthermore, no obvious side effect of PEGylated NGS is noted for the injected mice by histology, blood chemistry, and complete blood panel analysis in our pilot toxicity study. Although a lot more efforts are required to further understand the in vivo behaviors and the long-term toxicology of this new type of nanomaterials, our work is the first success of using carbon nanomaterials for efficient in vivo photothermal therapy by intravenous administration and suggests the great promise of graphene in biomedical applications, such as cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Li metal is considered to be the most attractive anode for next-generation batteries because of its high specific capacity and low reduction potential. However, uncontrolled Li dendrite growth and low coulombic efficiency cause severe capacity decay and safety issues. Here we propose a LiCl contained inorganic-organic hybrid layer on Li metal surface by a surface restraint dehalogenation reaction, which is highly uniform and features lithiophilic property as well as high ionic conductivity that can inhibit Li dendrite growth effectively. Consequently, the surface protected Li metal electrodes enable Li | Li symmetric cells to maintain a stable and low overpotential of 20 mV at a current density of 1 mA cm-2 after cycling over 3000 h, and enable Li | LiFePO4 pouch cell to decay only 0.05% in capacity per cycle at 5.0 C for 500 cycles, indicating excellent cycle stability and high rate capability. This work offers a simple and facile method to protect Li metal anode and promise a potential direction for industrialization of Li metal batteries.",

The as-synthesized spheres had large diameters of about 400 nm and thin shells of about 30 nm composed of numerous small nanocrystals.

We develop functionalization chemistry in order to impart solubility and compatibility of NGO in biological environments. We obtain size separated pegylated NGO sheets that are soluble in buffers and serum without agglomeration. The NGO sheets are found to be photoluminescent in the visible and infrared regions. The intrinsic photoluminescence (PL) of NGO is used for live cell imaging in the near-infrared (NIR) with little background. We found that simple physisorption via pi-stacking can be used for loading doxorubicin, a widely used cancer drug onto NGO functionalized with antibody for selective killing of cancer cells in vitro. Owing to its small size, intrinsic optical properties, large specific surface area, low cost, and useful non-covalent interactions with aromatic drug molecules, NGO is a promising new material for biological and medical applications.",

        "abstract": "We show that large surface areas exist for supramolecular chemistry on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) prefunctionalized noncovalently or covalently by common surfactant or acid-oxidation routes. Water-soluble SWNTs with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) functionalization via these routes allow for surprisingly high degrees of pi-stacking of aromatic molecules, including a cancer drug (doxorubicin) with ultrahigh loading capacity, a widely used fluorescence molecule (fluorescein), and combinations of molecules. Binding of molecules to nanotubes and their release can be controlled by varying the pH. The strength of pi-stacking of aromatic molecules is dependent on nanotube diameter, leading to a method for controlling the release rate of molecules from SWNTs by using nanotube materials with suitable diameter. This work introduces the concept of \"functionalization partitioning\" of SWNTs, i.e., imparting multiple chemical species, such as PEG, drugs, and fluorescent tags, with different functionalities onto the surface of the same nanotube. Such chemical partitioning should open up new opportunities in chemical, biological, and medical applications of novel nanomaterials.",

        "abstract": "Calcined MgAl-layered double hydroxides (CLDH-U) derived from layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors synthesized by urea decomposition, had the higher adsorption selectivity for thiosulfate (S2O32-) in aqueous solutions mixed with thiocyanate (SCN-) than the counterpart (CLDH-C) obtained by co-precipitation method. The adsorption rates for S2O32- over CLDH-U with diameter in 2\u03bcm and CLDH-C with diameter in 50nm were respectively about 98.00% and 94.80%, and those for SCN- were only about 0% and 6.84%. The results revealed that the selective adsorption was realized over these CLDH materials and the synthesis method influenced the adsorption behavior. The reason for the better selectivity over CLDH-U could be probably related to these mini sheets growing perpendicularly to the lamellate surface, which completely differed to the adsorption process over the small-sized counterpart. The different adsorption mechanisms of two CLDH materials were respectively proposed. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Constructing nanostructures with desirable morphology and size is a critical issue for pursuing high performance electrode materials. Ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheet arrays, which are composed of well aligned uniform long-range (~5 \u03bcm in length) and thin (~10 nm in thickness) nanosheets, with reasonable mass loading on Ni foam are prepared by a two-step hydrothermal reaction. As a supercapacitor electrode, a superior specific capacitance (~1782 F g(-1)) is obtained at current density of 1.8 A g(-1) (5 mA cm(-2)), much larger than that of the thicker nanostrucutures (~300 F g(-1)). The ultrathin nanosheet arrays electrode exhibits good rate capabilities, maintaining 51% of the initial capacity at current density of 30 mA cm(-2), and excellent long-term stability, remaining >90% of capacitance after 2000 cycles. Such high performance is attributed to the desirable morphologies, uniform architecture and high surface area. The results manifest that ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheet arrays are promising electrode material for supercapacitor in future application.",

In this study, RGOs were prepared by six typical reduction methods: N2H4 \u00b7 H2O, NaOH, NaBH4, solvothermal, high-temperature, and two-step. The samples were systematic compared by four aspects: dispersibility, reduction degree, defect repair degree, and electrical conductivity. On the basis of the comparison, a simple evaluation criterion was proposed for qualitatively judging the quality of RGO.

        "abstract": "A general method for the synthesis of metal oxide hollow spheres has been developed by using carbonaceous polysaccharide microspheres prepared from saccharide solution as templates. Hollow spheres of a series of metal oxides (SnO2, Al2O3, Ga2O3, CoO, NiO, Mn3O4, Cr2O3, La2O3, Y2O3, Lu2O3, CeO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) have been prepared in this way. The method involves the initial absorption of metal ions from solution into the functional surface layer of carbonaceous saccharide microspheres; these are then densified and cross-linked in a subsequent calcination and oxidation procedure to form metal oxide hollow spheres. Metal salts are used as starting materials, which widens the accessible field of metal oxide hollow spheres. The carbonaceous colloids used as templates have integral and uniform surface functional layers, which makes surface modification unnecessary and ensures homogeneity of the shell. Macroporous films or cheese-like nanostructures of oxides can also be prepared by slightly modified procedures. XRD, TEM, HRTEM, and SAED have been used to characterize the structures. In a preliminary study on the gas sensitivity of SnO2 hollow spheres, considerably reduced \"recovery times\" were noted, exemplifying the distinct properties imparted by the hollow structure. These hollow or porous nanostructures have the potential for diverse applications, such as in gas sensitivity or catalysis, or as advanced ceramic materials.",

TEM studies revealed that they exposed different crystal planes, such as {111} crystal planes to triangular nanoplates, mainly {100} and {111} planes to self-assembly nanowires. Hereby, do the distinct shapes and crystal planes have an impact on the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)? The great differences of the SERS spectra of rhodamine B at these Ag colloids confirmed that the shapes and crystal planes of silver have great effect on Raman enhancement, especially the crystal planes.",

In this work, we functionalized nanographene oxide (NGO), a novel graphitic material, with branched polyethylene glycol (PEG) to obtain a biocompatible NGO-PEG conjugate stable in various biological solutions, and used them for attaching hydrophobic aromatic molecules including a camptothecin (CPT) analogue, SN38, noncovalently via pi-pi stacking. The resulting NGO-PEG-SN38 complex exhibited excellent water solubility while maintaining its high cancer cell killing potency similar to that of the free SN38 molecules in organic solvents. The efficacy of NGO-PEG-SN38 was far higher than that of irinotecan (CPT-11), a FDA-approved water soluble SN38 prodrug used for the treatment of colon cancer. Our results showed that graphene is a novel class of material promising for biological applications including future in vivo cancer treatment with various aromatic, low-solubility drugs.",

Size\n and dimension analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and absorption spectroscopy revealed that the Au NRs were\n separated mainly as a function of their aspect ratio. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity of Au NRs with\n lower aspect ratio is notably stronger than that of NRs with higher aspect ratio under 633 nm laser excitation, due to the\n size-dependent absorption of the longitudinal plasmon band. The separation approach provides a method to improve the quality\n of NRs produced by large scale synthetic methods.",

The fractions containing\n longer rods showed relatively stronger oxygen-related surface trap emission, while the shorter ones had dominant band-edge\n emission. These results suggest that the final length distribution of CdS nanorods is not a result of random nucleation and\n growth, but is related to the local synthesis conditions. Inspired by these findings, different synthesis environments (N2, air, and O2) have been employed in order to tailor the length distribution. In addition to the rod length, the photoluminescence properties\n of CdS nanorods can also be manipulated. Increasing the oxygen partial pressure significantly changed the growth behavior\n of CdS nanorods by improving the anisotropic growth.",

Herein, NiTi layered double hydroxide (LDH) thin films with uniform density were synthesized by a process including two hydrothermal treatment steps and the composition of the hexagonal NiTi-LDH nanosheets was tunable in a relatively wide range. The obtained NiTi-LDH films on nickel foam show a high areal capacitance of 10.37 F cm-2 at 5 mA cm-2, and good cycling stability (86% of its initial value was preserved after 1000 charge-discharge cycles), much better than \u03b2-Ni(OH)2 and basic nickel hydroxides carbonate {Ni2(OH)2CO 3\u00b74H2O} films. It is indicated that NH 3\u00b7H2O in the reaction solution played some important roles including enlarging the particle size, focusing the size distribution, and regulating the stacking modes of NiTi-LDH on nickel foam. This work demonstrated the importance of homogeneous dispersion of Ti atoms in layered nanostructures used in supercapacitors. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "ZnS and ZnSe precursors (ZnS x 0.5en and ZnSe x 0.5en, en = ethylenediamine) were prepared via a solvothermal process using ethylenediamine as solvent. Phase-pure hexagonal wurtzite ZnS and ZnSe products were obtained by annealing the precursors in argon stream at temperatures above 350 degrees C. The role of ethylenediamine as a structure-directing coordination molecular template responsible for the morphologies of the annealed products was discussed. This work provided further insights into the solvent coordination molecular template (SCMT) mechanism previously proposed to explain the growth mechanism of CdE (E = S, Se, Te) nanorods in ethylenediamine (Inorg. Chem. 1999, 38, 1382). The as-prepared precursors as well as the annealed products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared absorbance spectroscopy (IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, and combustion analysis for C, N, H contents.",

        "abstract": "Identifying the phase purity of CdS nanorods (NRs) is complicated by the serious overlap between the X-ray diffraction peaks of zinc blende and wurtzite phases as well as anisotropic growth, which might hide a mixed phase. Here we show that the density gradient ultracentrifugation rate separation method can be used to sort CdS NRs synthesized under nitrogen according to differences in particle size and morphology. Furthermore, it was found that the different sized NRs formed in a single batch synthesis had different phases: the thinner ones (<3.5 nm in diameter) were predominantly wurtzite phase, while the thicker ones (>5 nm in diameter) were mainly zinc blende phase. Dark-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM images indicated the presence of numerous stacking faults in the thick zinc blende rods, while the wurtzite thin rods were exclusively single crystals. As a result of the differences in phase and stacking faults, the NRs showed different photoluminescent properties. The development of an effective way of separating such NRs thus leads to further insight into the differences in phase, structure, and optical properties between individual colloidal particles synthesized in a single batch. A preliminary mathematical model of the separation process has been proposed.",

        "abstract": "Nanocrystals with advanced magnetic or optical properties have been actively pursued for potential biological applications, including integrated imaging, diagnosis and therapy1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Among various magnetic nanocrystals10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, FeCo has superior magnetic properties, but it has yet to be explored owing to the problems of easy oxidation and potential toxicity10, 16, 17. Previously, FeCo nanocrystals with multilayered graphitic carbon, pyrolytic carbon or inert metals have been obtained15, 18, 19, but not in the single-shelled, discrete, chemically functionalized and water-soluble forms desired for biological applications. Here, we present a scalable chemical vapour deposition method to synthesize FeCo/single-graphitic-shell nanocrystals that are soluble and stable in water solutions. We explore the multiple functionalities of these core\u2013shell materials by characterizing the magnetic properties of the FeCo core and near-infrared optical absorbance of the single-layered graphitic shell. The nanocrystals exhibit ultra-high saturation magnetization, r1 and r2 relaxivities and high optical absorbance in the near-infrared region. Mesenchymal stem cells are able to internalize these nanoparticles, showing high negative-contrast enhancement in magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI). Preliminary in vivo experiments achieve long-lasting positive-contrast enhancement for vascular MRI in rabbits. These results point to the potential of using these nanocrystals for integrated diagnosis and therapeutic (photothermal-ablation) applications.",

The optimized synthesis (100-180 degrees C, longer than 48 h), thermal and hydrothermal stability, ion exchangeability and consequent magnetic and optical properties of the titanate nanotubes were systematically studied in this paper. First, nanotubes with monodisperse pore-size distribution were prepared. The formation mechanism of the titanate nanotubes was also studied. Second, the thermal and hydrothermal stability were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy. Results showed that sodium ions played a significant role in the stability of the frameworks. Third, the selective ion exchangeability was demonstrated with a series of ions. The ion substitution also enlarged the BET surface area of the titanate nanotubes to 240 m(2) x g(-1). Combination of these two features implied that these nanotubes might be functionalized by substitution of different transitional-metal ions and consequently used for selective catalysis. Magnetism, photoluminescence, and UV/Vis spectra of the substituted titanate nanotubes revealed that the magnetic and optical properties of the nanotubes were modifiable.",

Herein,using the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a probe reaction, we deliberatelyintroduced base-soluble Zn(II) or Al(III) sites into NiFe layered double hydroxides(LDHs), which are one of the best OER catalysts. Then, the Zn(II) or Al(III) siteswere selectively etched to create atomic M(II)/M(III) defects, which dramaticallyenhanced the OER activity. At a current density of 20 mA\u00b7cm\u22122, only 200 mV overpotential was required to generate M(II) defect-rich NiFe LDHs, which is the best NiFe-based OER catalyst reported to date. Density functional theory(DFT) calculations revealed that the creation of dangling Ni\u2013Fe sites (i.e., unsaturated coordinated Ni\u2013Fe sites) by defect engineering of a Ni\u2013O\u2013Fe site at the atomic scale efficiently lowers the Gibbs free energy of the oxygen evolutionprocess. This defect engineering strategy provides new insights into catalysts atthe atomic scale and should be beneficial for the design of a variety of catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Breaking the symmetry in catalysts through interface engineering has emerged as a new dimension in enhancing the catalytic performances, while the long-range asymmetry (i.e. in nanometer scale) in catalysts can hardly be achieved by alloying or doping. Herein, we introduce asymmetrical gradient effect into NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) at nano scale via a simple nanoarray construction strategy on Ni foam substrate. The electron energy loss spectroscopy, extended X-Ray absorption fine structure and other characterizations together revealed the concentration and valence states gradients in NiFe-LDH nanoarrays. Subsequently, the gradient effect leads to distinctly optimized binding strength of active sites to oxygen evolution intermediates, better electron transfers and boosted oxygen evolution performances, which are absent in non-gradient NiFe-LDH catalysts. Such long-range gradient effects in nanoarray materials provide new opportunities to understand their boosted catalytic performances and to rationally design better catalytic materials.",

        "abstract": "Nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets have shown optimal oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance; however, the role of the intercalated ions in the OER activity remains unclear. In this work, we show that the activity of the NiFe-LDHs can be tailored by the intercalated anions with different redox potentials. The intercalation of anions with low redox potential (high reducing ability), such as hypophosphites, leads to NiFe-LDHs with low OER overpotential of 240 mV and a small Tafel slope of 36.9 mV/dec, whereas NiFe-LDHs intercalated with anions of high redox potential (low reducing ability), such as fluorion, show a high overpotential of 370 mV and a Tafel slope of 80.8 mV/dec. The OER activity shows a surprising linear correlation with the standard redox potential. Density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicate that the intercalated anions alter the electronic structure of metal atoms which exposed at the surface. Anions with low standard redox potential and strong reducing ability transfer more electrons to the hydroxide layers. This increases the electron density of the surface metal sites and stabilizes their high-valence states, whose formation is known as the critical step prior to the OER process.",

Here we report the tuning of the local atomic structure of nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) by partially substituting Ni2+ with Fe2+ to introduce Fe-O-Fe moieties. These Fe2+-containing NiFe-LDHs exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an ultralow overpotential of 195 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2, which is among the best OER catalytic performance reported to date. In-situ X-ray absorption, Raman, and electrochemical analysis jointly reveal that the Fe-O-Fe motifs could stabilize high-valent metal sites at low overpotentials, thereby enhancing the OER activity. These results reveal the importance of tuning the local atomic structure for designing high efficiency electrocatalysts.",

Herein, we report the fabrication of a hierarchical structure containing CNTs/graphene/transition-metal hybrids (h-NCNTs/Gr/TM) with excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity. The synthesis was rationally designed by the growth of shorter nitrogen-doped CNTs (S-NCNTs) on longer NCNTs arrays (L-NCNTs), while graphene layers were in situ generated at their interconnecting sites. The hybrid material shows excellent OER and ORR performance, and was also demonstrated to be a highly active bifunctional catalyst for Zn\u2013air batteries, which could be due to rapid electron transport and full exposure of active sites in the hierarchical structure.",

Three types of pristine bismuth catalysts with designed morphologies were synthesized via the hydrothermal method and their catalytic activity and selectivity towards electrochemical CO 2  reduction were analyzed and discussed. In comparison with bismuth nanowires and nanospheres, two-dimensional bismuth nanosheets with a thickness of 10\u202fnm show enhanced selectivity for formate formation due to the highest (012) facet texture coefficient value. The highest Faradaic efficiency of 85% for the formation of formate was achieved at\u00a0\u22120.85\u202fV  vs.  RHE and a stability electrolysis test conducted at the same potential showed only 8% activity loss over 8\u202fh. These results reveal the importance of the nanoengineering strategy for developing the next generation of non-precious metal electrocatalyst for CO 2  reduction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Solar-powered desalination is a promising way to resolve the worldwide water crisis for its low consumption and simple facility. Considering the fragility and aggregations of traditional materials, which may decrease efficiency, we herein introduce a robust tungsten carbide (WC) nanoarray film as a stable and efficient photothermal material, whose absorption is over 97.5% throughout almost the whole solar spectrum range (220\u20132200\u202fnm) due to nanoarray structure and thus enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance. Besides, for the first time, we modified the film with sandwich wettability. It accelerates evaporation by reducing water\u2019s reflection of light, enlarging hydrophobic-hydrophilic boundaries, and depressing heat dissipation. Combining high absorption with unique wettability, the WC nanoarray film offers high solar-to-vapor efficiency of 90.8% and produces drinking water at the rate of (1.06\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10)\u202fkg\u202fm \u22122 \u202fh \u22121  from man-made seawater and (0.98\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.18)\u202fkg\u202fm \u22122 \u202fh \u22121  from heavy metal sewage under one sun (AM 1.5) while 98% performance remains after 1\u202fh\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 times\u2019 reutilization.",

Nickel\u2013iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) with specific interlayer anions (i.e. phosphate, phosphite, and hypophosphite) were fabricated by a co-precipitation method and investigated as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Intercalation of the phosphorus oxoanion enhanced the OER activity in an alkaline solution; the optimal performance (i.e., a low onset potential of 215 mV, a small Tafel slope of 37.7 mV/dec, and stable electrochemical behavior) was achieved with the hypophosphite-intercalated NiFe-LDH catalyst, demonstrating dramatic enhancement over the traditional carbonate-intercalated NiFe-LDH in terms of activity and durability. This enhanced performance is attributed to the interaction between the intercalated phosphorous oxoanions and the edge-sharing MO6 (M = Ni, Fe) layers, which modifies the surface electronic structure of the Ni sites. This concept should be inspiring for the design of more effective LDH-based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.",

The NiFeS2/S-GO on glassy carbon yields an OER current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 at 1.47 V and an ORR half-wave potential at 0.74 V (vs. RHE), giving an overvoltage difference as low as 0.73 V. When assembled in a rechargeable Zn\u2013air battery, the battery with NiFeS2/S-GO air electrode exhibits a steady charging potential (1.98 V) with very little decay in discharging potential (from 1.20 to 1.17 V) for 180 charging\u2013discharging cycles at 10 mA cm\u22122.

Due to large specific area and high surface atomic activity, two-dimensional (2D) materials have advantageous properties for HER. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are common 2D materials; however, the limited tunability of electronic structures and valence states have hindered their applications in hydrogen production. Herein, we report an in situ topotactic reduction method to optimize the HER performance of LDH-derived catalysts. Ultrathin 2D CoFe alloy nanosheets were derived from CoFe-LDH arrays on Ni foam via in situ topotactic conversion and feature the ability to stabilize highly dispersed platinum. The as-synthesized CoFe\u2013Pt1% nanosheets exhibited high catalytic activity towards the HER with the overpotential of 18 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm\u22122, which were comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalysts. Especially considering their mass activity, the utilization efficiency of Pt atoms in CoFe\u2013Pt1% is significantly enhanced up to almost 26 times, better than that of Pt/C under the same conditions. This in situ topotactic conversion method reveals applications in the fabrication of high-performance low-cost 2D metal-based catalysts.",

        "abstract": "The role of vacancy defects is demonstrated to be positive in various energy-related processes. However, introducing vacancy defects into single-crystalline nanostructures with given facets and studying their defect effect on electrocatalytic properties remains a great challenge. Here this study deliberately introduces oxygen defects into single-crystalline ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets with O-terminated {111} facets by mild solvothermal reduction using ethylene glycol under alkaline condition. As-prepared defect-rich Co3O4 nanosheets show a low overpotential of 220 mV with a small Tafel slope of 49.1 mV dec\u22121 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is among the best Co-based OER catalysts to date and even more active than the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst. Such vacancy defects are formed by balancing with reducing environments under solvothermal conditions, but are surprisingly stable even after 1000 cycles of scanning under OER working conditions. Density functional theory plus U calculation attributes the enhanced performance to the oxygen vacancies and consequently exposed second-layered Co metal sites, which leads to the lowered OER activation energy of 2.26 eV and improved electrical conductivity. This mild solvothermal reduction concept opens a new door for the understanding and future designing of advanced defect-based electrocatalysts.",

While nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) has been long recognized as a promising non-precious electrocatalyst for OER, its intrinsic activity needs further improvement. Herein, we design a highly-efficient oxygen evolution electrode based on defective NiFe LDH nanoarray. By combing the merits of the modulated electronic structure, more exposed active sites, and the conductive electrode, the defective NiFe LDH electrocatalysts show a low onset potential of 1.40 V (vs. RHE). An overpotential of only 200 mV is required for 10 mA cm\u22122, which is 48 mV lower than that of pristine NiFe-LDH. Density functional theory plus U (DFT+U) calculations are further employed for the origin of this OER activity enhancement. We find the introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to a lower valance state of Fe and the narrowed bandgap, which means the electrons tend to be easily excited into the conduction band, resulting in the lowered reaction overpotential and enhanced OER performance.",

        "title": "Understanding the incorporating effect of Co2+/Co3+ in NiFe-layered double hydroxide for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction",
        "abstract": "Abstract   NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) has been widely accepted as promising catalyst candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recently, incorporating Co atoms in NiFe laminates has been recognized as an effective way to enhance the OER activity, but their roles have been rarely studied. Herein, density functional theory plus U (DFT\u202f+\u202fU) calculations are employed to evaluate the OER thermodynamics after introducing bivalent Co 2+  or trivalent Co 3+  and consequent sites sensitivity in NiFe-LDH catalyst. Generally, based on computational results, incorporation of Co 2+ /Co 3+  into NiFe-LDH could modulate the electronic structure of metal sites and thus reducing their OER overpotential. Moreover, Co 3+ -doped NiFe-LDH has the lowest overpotential of \u03b7\u202f=\u202f0.413\u202feV among the above proposed structure. This point was fully demonstrated by Co 2+  and Co 3+ -incorporated NiFe-LDH nanosheets made by a co-precipitation method, by showing OER onset overpotential of 249\u202fmV for Co 3+ -doped NiFe-LDH, 264\u202fmV for Co 2+ -doped NiFe-LDH, which are 33\u202fmV and 18\u202fmV lower than that of pristine NiFe-LDH (282\u202fmV), respectively. Such improved OER activity were attributed to the lowered overpotential at the  * OOH formation step for Co 2+ -doped NiFe-LDH and the deprotonation step for Co 3+ -doped NiFe-LDH, which was the potential limiting step for their OER process. This work should be inspiring for future designing of more efficient NiFe-based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.",

NiFe hydroxide offers efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis in alkaline electrolyte, however weak binding of oxygenated intermediates on NiFe hydroxide still badly limits its catalytic activity. Herein, we developed a facile ball-milling method to enhance binding strength of NiFe hydroxide to oxygenated intermediates via generating tensile strain, which reduced the anti-bonding filling states in the d orbital and thus facilitated oxygenated intermediates adsorption. The NiFe hydroxide with tensile strain increasing after ball-milling exhibits an OER onset potential as low as 1.44 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and requires only a 270 mV overpotential to reach a water oxidation current density of 10 mA cm-2.",

Herein, we reduced ultrathin LDH precursors in situ and topotactically converted them to atomically thick (~2 nm) two-dimensional (2D) multi-metallic, single crystalline alloy nanosheets with highly tunable metallic compositions. The as-obtained alloy nanosheets not only maintained the vertically aligned ultrathin 2D structure, but also inherited the atomic dispersion of the minor metallic compositions of the LDH precursors, even though the atomic percentage was higher than 20%, which is far beyond the reported percentages for single-atom dispersions (usually less than 0.1%). Besides, surface engineering of the alloy nanosheets can finely tune the surface electronic structure for catalytic applications. Such in situ topotactic conversion strategy has introduced a novel approach for atomically dispersed alloy nanostructures and reinforced the synthetic methodology for ultrathin 2D metal-based catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Ternary NiCoFe-layered double hydroxide (NiCoIIIFe-LDH) with Co3+ is grafted on nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (N-GO) by an in situ growth route. The array-like colloid composite of NiCoIIIFe-LDH/N-GO is used as a bifunctional catalyst for both oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR). The NiCoIIIFe-LDH/N-GO array has a 3D open structure with less stacking of LDHs and an enlarged specific surface area. The hierarchical structure design and novel material chemistry endow high activity propelling O2 redox. By exposing more amounts of Ni and Fe active sites, the NiCoIIIFe-LDH/N-GO illustrates a relatively low onset potential (1.41 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.1 mol L\u22121 KOH solution under the OER process. Furthermore, by introducing high valence Co3+, the onset potential of this material in ORR is 0.88 V. The overvoltage difference is 0.769 V between OER and ORR. The key factors for the excellent bifunctional catalytic performance are believed to be the Co with a high valence, the N-doping of graphene materials, and the highly exposed Ni and Fe active sites in the array-like colloid composite. This work further demonstrates the possibility to exploit the application potential of LDHs as OER and ORR bifunctional electrochemical catalysts.",

In this work, we introduce an alcohothermal synthesis method for fabricating NiFe-LDHs with dehydrated galleries. The proposed process involves incomplete hydrolysis of urea for the simultaneous precipitation of metal ions, with the resulting water-deficient ethanol environment leading to the formation of a dehydrated structure. The formation of a gallery-dehydrated layer structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as by a subsequent rehydration process. The methodology introduced here is also applicable for fabricating Fe-based LDHs (NiFe-LDH and NiCoFe-LDH) nanoarrays, which cannot be produced under the same conditions in aqueous media because of the different precipitation processes involved. The LDH nanoarrays exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, as a result of their high intrinsic activity and unique structural features. In summary, this study not only introduces a new method for synthesizing LDH materials, but also provides a new route towards highly active and robust electrodes for electrocatalysis.",

        "abstract": "Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is a promising way to mitigate the urgent energy and environmental issues, but how to increase the selectivity for desired product among multiple competing reaction pathways remains a bottleneck. Here, we demonstrate that engineering the gas\u2013liquid\u2013solid contact interface on the electrode surface could tailor the selectivity of CO2 reduction and meanwhile suppress H2 production through regulated reaction kinetics. Specifically, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was utilized to modify a Cu nanoarray electrode as an example, which is able to change the electrode surface from aerophobic to aerophilic state. The enriched nano-tunnels of the Cu nanoarray electrode can facilitate CO2 transportation and pin gaseous products on the electrode surface. The latter is believed to be the reason that boosts the Faradaic efficiency of liquid products by 67% and limits the H2 production to less than half of before. This interface engineering strategy also lowered H2O (proton) affinity, therefore promoting CO and HCOOH production. Engineering the electrode contact interface controls the reaction kinetics and the selectivity of products, which should be inspiring for other electrochemical reactions.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), which usually involve faradaic or pseudocapacitive positive materials and electric double-layer capacitive negative materials, have demonstrated great potentials with enhanced energy density outdistancing traditional electrical double-layer capacitors. To endow materials with higher energy density and power density, the rational design and synthesis of electrodes with hierarchical and mesoporous structure are highly desired. In this work, we report the fabrication of hierarchical mesoporous NiO nanoarrays (NiO-HMNAs) as a battery-type electrode for hybrid supercapacitor with an ultrahigh specific capacitance (3114 F g\u22121 at the current density of 5 mA cm\u22122), which is beyond the theoretical faradaic capacitance value of NiO. NiO-HMNAs were prepared by a self-generated sacrificial template approach, which involves the preparation of hierarchical ZnO/NiO composites by co-deposition of Zn2+ and Ni2+ and the removal of ZnO by an alkali etching process to construct mesoporous structure. The ultrahigh capacitance of NiO-HMNAs is ascribed to the nearly full redox reaction of NiO in the unique hierarchical mesoporous architecture, and the raised electrical double-layer capacitance at the enlarged surface of nanoarrays. Moreover, the optimized HSC fabricated by using NiO-HMNAs as the positive electrode and macroporous graphene monoliths (MGMs) as the negative electrode has demonstrated a high energy density of 67.0 W h kg\u22121 at a power density of 320 W kg\u22121 with a maximum voltage of 1.6 V and outstanding cycleability (capacitance retention of 89.6% after 6000 cycles).",

Herein, we show a rational strategy to fabricate multi-shelled hollow chromium (III) terephthalate MOFs (MIL-101) with single-crystalline shells through step-by-step crystal growth and subsequent etching processes. This strategy relies on the creation of inhomogeneous MOF crystals in which the outer layer is chemically more robust than the inner layer and can be selectively etched by acetic acid. The regulation of MOF nucleation and crystallization allows the tailoring of the cavity size and shell thickness of each layer. The resultant multi-shelled hollow MIL-101 crystals show significantly enhanced catalytic activity during styrene oxidation. The insight gained from this systematic study will aid in the rational design and synthesis of other multi-shelled hollow structures and the further expansion of their applications.",

In this work, a coordination replication strategy was developed to construct Cu-based MOFs into 3\u2009D hierarchical nanoarray architectures by using Cu(OH)2 nanorod arrays as a sacrificial template. The Cu(OH)2 nanorod arrays served as the Cu source and coordinated with an organic ligand to form MOF crystals, and they also served as the 3\u2009D substrate to support the growth of the Cu-based MOFs. This strategy could also be applied to synthesize various hierarchical Cu-based MOF arrays, which demonstrated the general efficacy of the method. Owing to their unique structural advantages (hierarchical porosity, large surface area, and intimate contact with the 3\u2009D substrate), these MOF nanoarrays exhibit excellent catalytic activity and cycling stability in heterogeneous catalysis as structured catalysts. This strategy opens up new possibilities for the construction of immobilized MOF-based 3\u2009D nanoarrays for multipurpose applications.",

Here, we demonstrate that selective photocatalysis can be realized by the assistance of gold-enhanced selective adsorption onto carbon-coated Au/TiO2 mesoporous microspheres (Au/TiO2@C-MM), which were prepared via a surfactant-assisted two-step method that involved the assembly of oleic acid-stabilized titania and gold nanoparticles into colloidal spheres in an emulsion using sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactant and the conversion of the surfactants into carbon under annealing in Ar. Due to the negatively charged amorphous carbon, the mesoporous structure, and the surface plasmon resonance absorption of the Au components, the Au/TiO2@C-MM shows enhanced charge- and size-selective adsorption properties, which enables the materials to have high selectivity in the photocatalytic process.",

Our superwetting electrodes are hereby designed to circumvent these issues through controlling the O 2  bubbles adsorption/evolution behavior at electrode surface while maintaining the outstanding electrocatalysis performance. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time the application of superwetting catalytic electrodes in the tri-electrode rechargeable ZABs. Two different functional electrodes, namely superaerophilic cobalt-incorporated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes hybrid catalyst and superaerophobic NiFe-layered double hydroxide arrays, serve as exceptional catalysts for discharging and charging process respectively, thus achieving superior battery performance. The low-cost superwetting cathode pairs even exhibit a much better catalytic activity and durability than the combination of precious Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts. The as-assembled ZABs deliver a greatly improved peak power current of 245\u202fmW\u202fcm \u22122  at 396\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122  over that of the ZABs composed of precious metal electrodes (186\u202fmW\u202fcm \u22122 ), together with small polarization, high reversibility, and stability over long cycles. The design of superwetting electrode marks a general and effective strategy to achieve high-performance rechargeable ZABs.",

Electrode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play a critical role in the operation of rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Herein, we report a simple and scalable strategy to fabricate porous carbon polyhedra using Zn-doped Co-based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZnCo-ZIFs) as precursors. Strikingly, Zn doping leads to smaller Co nanoparticles and higher nitrogen content, which in turn enhances the ORR and OER activities of the obtained porous carbon polyhedra. The synergistic effect of the N-doped carbon and cobalt nanoparticles in the composite, the improved conductivity resulting from the high graphitization of carbon, and the large surface area of the porous polyhedral structure resulted in porous carbon polyhedra with excellent ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media. More importantly, air cathodes based on the optimal porous carbon polyhedra further exhibited superior performance to Pt/C catalysts in primary and rechargeable zinc-air batteries.",

Recently, metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) derived materials have shown great potential in ORR and OER; however, they may suffer from poor conductivity with limited electrochemical performance especially towards OER. In this work, nickel\u2013cobalt oxides supported on Co/N decorated graphene were prepared by introducing nickel in a zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) as the precursor, which showed improved OER performance due to the as-derived NixCoyO4, and maintained the ORR performance of Co/N doped carbon at the same time. Meanwhile, graphene was utilized to further enhance the electrochemical surface area and charge transfer efficiency. The resulting composites show a potential of 0.796 V at 3 mA cm\u22122 and superior stability to Pt/C towards ORR, as well as a potential of 1.629 V to achieve 10 mA cm\u22122 current density for OER, which is much better than that of IrO2.

However, the hydrophobic nature of CNTAs usually limits the wetting of aqueous solutions containing inorganic precursors of TMOs, which results in poor decoration of TMOs on it. Herein, we report a facile strategy to tune the wettability of 3D CNTAs by controlling the nitrogen-doping degree. Particularly, superhydrophilic nitrogen-doped CNTAs (N-CNTAs) were obtained by using pyridine as the reactant, which allows uniform anchoring of cobalt oxide nanoparticles (NPs) on their surface through a simple self-priming freeze-drying assisted immobilization method. The heteroatom-doping and uniformly distributed cobalt oxide NPs endow the obtained hybrid material (Co3O4/N-CNTAs) with excellent OER and ORR performances, which also demonstrated their high efficiency as bifunctional catalysts for Zn\u2013air batteries.",

        "abstract": "The rational structure and composition manipulation for the efficient, affordable bifunctional electrocatalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for renewable-energy technologies including fuel cells and metal\u2013air batteries. Metal oxide nanoarray electrodes are considered to be alternative options for this issue, although they always suffer from poor conductivity and limited ORR performance in terms of onset potential and diffusion current. In this study, we develop an alternative strategy to prepare a novel bifunctional catalyst by coating three-dimensional CoOx nanoarrays with a porous nitrogen-doped carbon layer (NC). The porous NC not only provides a conductive coating to benefit the charge transfer and retains the channels for electrolyte diffusion, but also greatly enhances the electrochemical surface area, which endows the electrode with higher activity for both the OER and ORR in terms of onset potential and diffusion current. When employed as an air cathode in rechargeable zinc\u2013air batteries over 100 cycles, the electrode exhibits durable performance superior to those of Pt/C and IrO2/C. The results fully demonstrate the great potential of the strategy in electrode construction.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid metal oxide architectures have attracted much attention in recent years due to their great potential to meet the ever-increasing requirements of high energy density and power density in energy storage applications. Here, we report a facile hydrothermal synthesis of a binder-free hierarchical NiCo2O4@NiO nanowire array (HNW) with robust adhesion, for use in electrochemical capacitors (ECs). The resulting hybrid array electrode exhibits superior pseudocapacitive performance with high specific capacitance (2220 F g\u22121), remarkable rate capability, and excellent cycling performance (93.1% retention after 3000 cycles). Furthermore, a NiCo2O4@NiO//AC asymmetric supercapacitor was prepared and found to exhibit a high energy density (31.5 W h kg\u22121) at a power density of 215.2 W kg\u22121 and superior cycling stability (89% of the initial capacity retention at 50 A g\u22121 over 3000 cycles). This outstanding electrochemical performance benefits from the synergistic contribution of the composite and unique hierarchical architecture. Such highly integrated hybrid array electrodes will be extremely helpful towards the fabrication of high-performance nanoenergy systems.",

        "abstract": "Investigations on Ag nanostructures/reduced graphene oxide composites have been frequently reported, yet the morphology control of those loaded Ag nanocrystals is still challenging. We herein develop a facile method to grow triangular Ag nanoplates (AgP) on polyethylenimine-modified reduced graphene oxide (AgP/PEI-rGO). The AgP/PEI-rGO hybrids show unexpected high stability against chloride ions (Cl(-) ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), which is possibly due to the strong interaction between surface Ag atoms with the amine groups of PEI. In the chronoamperometry measurements for detecting H2 O2 , N2 H4 , and NaNO2 , the AgP/PEI-rGO hybrid shows very wide linear ranges (usually 10(-6) -10(-2) \u2005mol\u2009L(-1) for H2 O2 , N2 H4 , and NaNO2 ) and low detection limits (down to \u22481\u00d710(-7) \u2005mol\u2009L(-1) ), which demonstrate the promising electrochemical sensor applications of these metal/graphene hybrids with well-defined morphologies and facets. In addition, this strategy could be extended to the deposition of other noble metals on rGO with controlled morphologies. ",

        "abstract": "Doped carbon materials (DCM) with multiple heteroatoms hold broad interest in electrochemical catalysis and energy storage but require several steps to fabricate, which greatly hinder their practical applications. In this study, a facile strategy is developed to enable the fast fabrication of multiply doped carbon materials via room-temperature dehalogenation of polyvinyl dichloride (PVDC) promoted by KOH with the presence of different organic dopants. A N,S-codoped carbon material (NS-DCM) is demonstratively synthesized using two dopants (dimethylformamide for N doping and dimethyl sulfoxide for S doping). Afterward, the precursive room-temperature NS-DCM with intentionally overdosed KOH is submitted to inert annealing to obtain large specific surface area and high conductivity. Remarkably, NS-DCM annealed at 600 \u00b0C (named as 600-NS-DCM), with 3.0 atom % N and 2.4 atom % S, exhibits a very high specific capacitance of 427 F g at 1.0 A g in acidic electrolyte and also keeps \u223c60% of capacitance at ultrahigh current density of 100.0 A g. Furthermore, capacitive deionization (CDI) measurements reveal that 600-NS-DCM possesses a large desalination capacity of 32.3 mg g (40.0 mg L NaCl) and very good cycling stability. Our strategy of fabricating multiply doped carbon materials can be potentially extended to the synthesis of carbon materials with various combinations of heteroatom doping for broad electrochemical applications.",

In this study, a highly efficient bifunctional oxygen catalyst, which was made of bamboo-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes with embedded cobalt nanoparticles (Co@NCNTs), was fabricated by a one-step pyrolysis route. Systematic electrochemical results demonstrated that the optimized electrocatalyst only needed a small potential hysteresis of about 0.834\u2005V to achieve 1\u2005mA\u2009cm\u22122 ORR current and 10\u2005mA\u2009cm\u22122 OER current, and simultaneously gave superior stability and methanol tolerance to those of commercial metal catalysts. The major factors that influenced the bifunctional catalyst performance of Co@NCNTs are discussed, among which the nitrogen chemical state and metal element play important roles. Moreover, the catalyst showed good activity and stability in rechargeable zinc\u2013air batteries, which indicated their potential applications in metal\u2013air batteries, fuel cells, and water-splitting devices.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous supercapacitors are among the most promising materials for clean and renewable energy storage; however, their utilization for applications is limited by their low specific energy arising from issues due to water splitting. Herein, water splitting-inactive electrode materials of mesoporous carbon were fabricated through the dehalogenation of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) by sodium ethoxide (EtONa). The as-generated EtOH and NaF were demonstrated to facilitate the formation of hierarchical porous carbon based on the bubble and templating effects. Due to full dehalogenation, the resulting carbon materials acquired high contents of carbon without unfavorable alien dopants. The resulting porous, dehalogenated, carbon materials were applied as electrode materials for an aqueous supercapacitor neutral electrolyte. The significantly suppressed water-splitting activity has been addressed in the electrochemical system. Therefore, the open circuit voltage (OCV) could be safely expanded to 2.0 V. Over 94.0% of the capacitance was also maintained after cycling 5000 times at 5.0 A g\u22121. Our strategy that utilizes water-splitting inactive electrode materials to expand the working window of an aqueous supercapacitor may enable the design of materials for aqueous supercapacitors with higher OCVs over 2.0 V.",

In this study, thin sandwich composites of GO and N-doped carbon (GO@NdC) were fabricated through controllable deposition of polyvinyl dichloride (PVDC)-dehalogenated carbon on GO; this method exploited the high affinity between PVDC and GO. The thin deposited carbon layers on GO achieved the thicknesses ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 nm. Considering that dehalogenated carbon has been verified to be highly reactive for coupling heteroelements, an overall N content of \u223c7.0 at% was obtained with the addition of melamine as a N source. Moreover, the byproducts EtOH and NaCl could tune the composites into open 3D structures in situ, efficiently preventing the thin-layered composites from re-stacking. After activation with KOH, GO@NdC further demonstrated a hierarchical pore structure and large specific surface area. Remarkably, KOH-activated GO@NdC exhibited a high specific capacitance of \u223c354 F g\u22121 and a capacitance retention of u003e65% (at 10.0 A g\u22121).

Additionally, interconnected graphitic carbon walls, forming separated cells, can ensure high electrical conductivity, which were formed after acid-leaching of metallic components. Remarkably, N-CN9 showed excellent bifunctional activities towards oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Moreover, N-CN9 assembled Zn-air battery (ZAB) exhibited an operating voltage of 1.35\u00a0V under applied current density of 1.0\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122 , which is highly comparable to that of PtRu/C catalyst.

Conductive carbon materials with heteroatom doping and rich porosity is the most common strategy for the effective prevention of polysulfide shuttle, but are usually obtained with high costs and tedious procedures. Herein, we managed to obtain highly porous N, S-codoped carbon materials (NS-C) through treating waste plastic of polyvinylchloride (PVC) with KOH. The resulting NS-C was revealed to be highly efficient hosts for sulfur cathode, achieving large reversible capacities of 1205 mA h g\u22121 and 836 mA h g\u22121 at 0.1C and 1.0C, respectively, and remaining at 550 mA h g\u22121 after 500 cycles at 1C rate, showing an outstanding cycling stability. The significantly enhanced cycling performance was mainly ascribed to both the hierarchically porous structure and heavy N, S co-dopants, which respectively provided physical blocks and chemical affinity for the efficient immobilization of intermediate lithium polysulfides. The results provide an effective paradigm in the surface chemistry and sulfur cathode materials design for high-performance Li\u2013S batteries and a new application for recycled plastic waste.",

It is found that the halogen elements (F, Cl) connecting to vinylidene units are highly reactive so that dehalogenation can take place a few seconds at room temperature by simple hand grinding in the presence of strong inorganic alkaline. Furthermore, the halogen element-leaving sites are shown to be susceptible to heteroatom doping (e.g., N doping) to become stable capacitive sites for charge storage (e.g., ions). By using a mixture of NaOEt and KOH as dehalogenation reagents, abundant hierarchical pores (macro/meso/micropores) in the resultant doped carbon matrix for fast mass transportation can be created. Very high capacitance (328 F g\u22121 at 0.5 A g\u22121) and rate capability (75.3% retention at 50 A g\u22121 and 62.5% retention at 100 A g\u22121) are observed for the newly developed halogenated polymer-derived doped carbon materials.",

        "abstract": "The reaction of calcium carbide (CaC2) with water to produce acetylene is common in industrial production, but its side reaction, removal of calcium from CaC2 (also termed de-Ca) to fabricate highly graphitic carbon, is highly overlooked. Herein, we report the synthesis of highly crystalline few-layered graphene by controlling the reaction of tetragonal-phased CaC2 with water at room temperature (20\u201325 \u00b0C). The resulting carbon materials were revealed to be highly graphitic, with \u223c3 nm thickness, containing u003e93 at% carbon. Raman spectroscopy evidenced their low defect content with a defect (D)/graphitization (G) ratio of \u223c0.07. HRTEM further verified their high graphitization degree. A formation mechanism was proposed: the C22\u2212 dumbbells donate their electrons to nearby oxidative species, e.g. H+ in water, followed by topotactic cross-linking to form a conjugated sp2-carbon network. Furthermore, the capability of CaC2 reduction and re-assembly into graphitic carbon was clearly evidenced by reaction with Ag+ in non-aqueous solvent, which resulted in a larger quantity of graphene materials and small-sized Ag nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "Herein, a strategy for one-step fabrication of cobalt sulfide/graphene (Co1\u2212xS/G) nanocomposite as bifunctional catalyst for oxygen catalysis is demonstrated. The one-step fabrication method involves annealing the mixture of cobalt salt, thioacetamide, and graphene oxide with the assistance of small amount of glycol without any further purification steps. The Co1\u2212xS/G shows a morphology with small-sized Co1\u2212xS nanocrystals strongly and uniformly anchored on the graphene surface. Systematically electrochemical studies demonstrate that the Co1\u2212xS/G with optimized components shows superior catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution, which are comparable or even superior to commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts. As a result, the potential hysteresis of Co1\u2212xS/G is the lowest among all the samples. The facile operability of the fabrication method and the high bifunctional activity of Co1\u2212xS/G may pave one practical way for broad applications including fuel cell, metal-O2 battery, and water electrolysis.",

        "abstract": "Single-atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) have gained tremendous attention due to their unique active sites and strong metal\u2013substrate interactions. However, the current synthesis of SAECs mostly relies on costly precursors and rigid synthetic conditions and often results in very low content of single-site metal atoms. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis method to prepare metal\u2013nitrogen\u2013carbon SAECs based on formamide condensation and carbonization, featuring a cost-effective general methodology for the mass production of SAECs with high loading of atomically dispersed metal sites. The products with metal inclusion were termed as formamide-converted metal\u2013nitrogen\u2013carbon (shortened as f-MNC) materials. Seven types of single-metallic f-MNC (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Zn, Mo and Ir), two bi-metallic (ZnFe and ZnCo) and one tri-metallic (ZnFeCo) SAECs were synthesized to demonstrate the generality of the methodology developed. Remarkably, these f-MNC SAECs can be coated onto various supports with an ultrathin layer as pyrolysis-free electrocatalysts, among which the carbon nanotube-supported f-FeNC and f-NiNC SAECs showed high performance for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), respectively. Furthermore, the pyrolysis products of supported f-MNC can still render isolated metallic sites with excellent activity, as exemplified by the bi-metallic f-FeCoNC SAEC, which exhibited outstanding ORR performance in both alkaline and acid electrolytes by delivering \u223c70 and \u223c20 mV higher half-wave potentials than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C, respectively. This work offers a feasible approach to design and manufacture SAECs with tuneable atomic metal components and high density of single-site metal loading, and thus may accelerate the deployment of SAECs for various energy technology applications.",

        "abstract": "Biological electrogenic systems use protein-based ionic pumps to move salt ions uphill across a cell membrane to accumulate an ion concentration gradient from the equilibrium physiological environment. Toward high-performance and robust artificial electric organs, attaining an antigradient ion transport mode by fully abiotic materials remains a great challenge. Herein, a light-driven proton pump transport phenomenon through a Janus graphene oxide membrane (JGOM) is reported. The JGOM is fabricated by sequential deposition of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets modified with photobase (BOH) and photoacid (HA) molecules. Upon ultraviolet light illumination, the generation of a net protonic photocurrent through the JGOM, from the HA-GO to the BOH-GO side, is observed. The directional proton flow can thus establish a transmembrane proton concentration gradient of up to 0.8 pH units mm membrane area at a proton transport rate of 3.0 mol h m . Against a concentration gradient, antigradient proton transport can be achieved. The working principle is explained in terms of asymmetric surface charge polarization on HA-GO and BOH-GO multilayers triggered by photoisomerization reactions, and the consequent intramembrane proton concentration gradient. The implementation of membrane-scale light-harvesting 2D nanofluidic system that mimics the charge process of the bioelectric organs makes a straightforward step toward artificial electrogenic and photosynthetic applications.",

The electrode requires the overpotentials of 58\u2009mV and 184\u2009mV for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions respectively, meanwhile maintaining remarkable long-term durability. The prominent performance is due to the systematic optimization of chemical composition and geometric structure principally-that is, abundant electrocatalytic active sites, excellent conductivity of metallic 1T' MoS, synergistic effects among iron, cobalt, nickel ions, and the superaerophobicity of electrode surface for fast mass transfer. The electrode is also demonstrated to function as anode and cathode, simultaneously, delivering 10\u2009mA\u2009cm at a cell voltage of 1.429\u2009V.

Herein, 3D self-supported Fe-doped Ni2P nanosheet arrays are synthesized on Ni foam by hydrothermal method followed by in situ phosphorization, which serve as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. The as-synthesized (Ni0.33Fe0.67)2P with moderate Fe doping shows an outstanding OER performance, which only requires an overpotential of \u2248230 mV to reach 50 mA cm\u22122 and is more efficient than the other Fe incorporated Ni2P electrodes. In addition, the (Ni0.33Fe0.67)2P exhibits excellent activity toward HER with a small overpotential of \u2248214 mV to reach 50 mA cm\u22122. Furthermore, an alkaline electrolyzer is measured using (Ni0.33Fe0.67)2P electrodes as cathode and anode, respectively, which requires cell voltage of 1.49 V to reach 10 mA cm\u22122 as well as shows excellent stability with good nanoarray construction. Such good performance is attributed to the high intrinsic activity and superaerophobic surface property.",

Herein, ternary NiCoP nanosheet arrays (NSAs) were fabricated on 3D Ni foam by a facile hydrothermal method followed by phosphorization. These arrays serve as bifunctional alkaline catalysts, exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic performance and good working stability for both the HER and OER. The overpotentials of the NiCoP NSA electrode required to drive a current density of 50 mA/cm2 for the HER and OER are as low as 133 and 308 mV, respectively, which is ascribed to excellent intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, fast electron transport, and a unique superaerophobic structure. When NiCoP was integrated as both anodic and cathodic material, the electrolyzer required a potential as low as ~1.77 V to drive a current density of 50 mA/cm2 for overall water splitting, which is much smaller than a reported electrolyzer using the same kind of phosphide-based material and is even better than the combination of Pt/C and Ir/C, the best known noble metal-based electrodes. Combining satisfactory working stability and high activity, this NiCoP electrode paves the way for exploring overall water splitting catalysts.",

The Janus electrode with opposite wettability on adjacent sides maintains stable gas reservoir in the aerophilic side while shortening O2 pathway to catalysts in the aerophobic side, resulting in superior ORR performance (22.5 mA/cm2 @ 0.5 V) than merely aerophilic or aerophilic electrodes.

The 3D-PNNF electrodes have a high surface area, show tight binding to the electroconductive substrate, and most importantly, have superaerophobic (bubble repellent) surfaces. Therefore, the electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation performance of the 3D-PNNF electrodes was much higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts because of its ultra-weak gas-bubble adhesion and ultra-fast gas-bubble release. Furthermore, the 3D-PNNF electrodes showed ultra-high stability even under a high current density (260 mA/cm2), which makes it promising for practical applications.

        "abstract": "Gas-involving electrochemical reactions, including gas evolution reactions and gas consumption reactions, are essential components of the energy conversion processes and gathering elevating attention from researchers. Besides the development of highly active catalysts, gas management during gas-involving electrochemical reactions is equally critical for industrial applications to achieve high reaction rates (hundreds of milliamperes per square centimeter) under practical operation voltages. Biomimetic surfaces, which generally show regular micro/nanostructures, offer new insights to address this issue because of their special wetting capabilities. Although a series of nanoarray-based structured electrodes have been constructed and demonstrated with excellent performances for gas-involving electrochemical reactions, understanding of bubble wetting behavior remains elusive. In this Account, our recent works including understanding the way to achieve the superwetting properties of solid electrode surfaces, and our advanced design and fabrication of superwetting electrodes for different types of electrochemical gas-involving electrochemical reactions are summarized. To begin, we first put forward several criteria of superwetting surfaces, including superaerophobic surfaces and superaerophilic surfaces. Then, we discuss how the nanoarray-based surface engineering technology can achieve the superwetting properties, in which high roughness of the nanoarray architecture is discovered to be a critical factor for constructing superaerophobic and superaerophilic surfaces. Finally, the feasibility of superwetting electrodes for enhancing the performances of gas-involving electrochemical reactions is also analyzed. Based on theoretical guidance, a series of superaerophobic and superaerophilic electrodes with various methods, such as hydrothermal reactions, electrodeposition technology and high-temperature vapor phase growth, have been built for practice. By comparing with the traditional planar electrodes fabricated by drop-casting method, the superaerophobic electrodes afford a low adhesion force to gas products and accelerate gas bubbles evolution, resulting in fast current increase and stable current for gas evolution reactions. This phenomenon is confirmed by operating different gas evolution reactions (hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and hydrazine oxidation) using superaerophobic electrodes with different catalysts (e.g., MoS, Pt and Cu). On the other side, the superaerophilic electrodes can improve the catalytic performance of gas consumption reaction (e.g., oxygen reduction reaction) by facilitating gas diffusion and electron transport. Following theoretical analyses and experimental demonstrations, we assemble several energy conversion systems (e.g., electrochemical water splitting and direct hydrazine fuel cells) based on superwetting electrodes and test their performances. By virtue of the structural advantages of electrodes, these energy conversion systems show much higher energy efficiencies than their counterparts. In the last section, we put forward several future fields which are worthy for further exploration as rational extensions of the superwetting electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Highly efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (OWS) are vital for large-scale hydrogen production. Herein, we demonstrate a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst \u2013 Co 3 (PO 4 ) 2  nanosheet arrays \u2013 prepared by a combined hydrothermal growth and plasma treatment. Owing to the large surface area, enhanced conductivity, the abundance of coordinately unsaturated Co 3+  sites and numerous oxygen vacancies, the plasma activated Co 3 (PO 4 ) 2  nanosheet arrays exhibit low overpotentials for oxygen evolution reaction (240\u202fmV) and hydrogen evolution reaction (50\u202fmV) at 10\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122  with excellent stability. The overall performance is comparable to the best reports for precious-metal-free electrocatalysts. Also, the plasma activated Co 3 (PO 4 ) 2  nanosheet arrays show superior kinetics for hydrogen- and oxygen-evolution with Tafel slope values of 35 and 53\u202fmV dec \u22121 , respectively. The overall-water-splitting, with 10\u202fmA\u202fcm \u20132  at a low voltage of 1.48\u202fV, is achieved using the nanosheet arrays as both the anode and cathode and the performance surpasses that of the IrO 2 /C Pt/C couple for sufficiently high overpotentials. This work presents a promising strategy for designing high-performance electrocatalysts toward overall water splitting.",

This paper reviews the activity, stability and durability for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium of different types of recently reported electrocatalysts such as Ni, Co, NiCo, Fe, Se, Mo, Cu, Mn, Zn, V, Ti/Ta, and metal free based earth-abundant-electrocatalysts. Further, this paper reviews the strategies used to achieve the remarkably low overpotential (including \u03b7 10 : \u2264100\u202fmV), high long term stability (including \u2265100\u202fh) and high durability (including \u22655000 cycles) of earth-abundant-electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium and those are better or well comparable with the state-of-the-art IrO 2  electrocatalyst 2 . Finally, this paper summarizes the efficient strategies such as preparing porous or nanostructured materials, preparing quantum sized materials, doping metals or heteroatoms, tuning the optimal crystal structure, preparing bimetallic/multi-metallic materials, preparing materials with oxygen vacancies/defects, preparing amorphous materials, preparing metal chalcogenides, preparing metal oxy hydroxides, and integrating electrocatalysts with carbon to enhance the activity, stability, and durability for OER.",

Without external powers, this system employs hydrazine bifunctionally as the fuel of direct hydrazine fuel cell and the splitting target, namely a sole consumable, and exhibits an H evolution rate of 9.95\u2009mmol\u2009h, a 98% Faradaic efficiency and a 20-h stability, all comparable to the best reported for self-powered water splitting.

Moreover, the CuS nanosheets showed a stable CO2 electroreduction capability up to 60 h. The high performance of CuS@NF for CO2 electroreduction was ascribed to the nanosheet morphology as well as the presence of S species.

        "abstract": "Carbon nanodots (CDs) formed by hydrothermal dehydration occur as mixtures of differently sized nanoparticles with different degrees of carbonization. Common ultracentrifugation has failed in sorting them, owing to their extremely high colloidal stability. Here, we introduce an ultracentrifugation method using a hydrophilicity gradient to sort such non-sedimental CDs. CDs, synthesized from citric acid and ethylenediamine, were pre-treated by acetone to form clusters. Such clusters \u201cde-clustered\u201d as they were forced to sediment through media comprising gradients of ethanol and water with varied volume ratios. Primary CDs with varied sizes and degrees of carbonization detached from the clusters to become well dispersed in the corresponding gradient layers. Their settling level was highly dependent on the varied hydrophilicity and solubility of the environmental media. Thus, the proposed hydrophilicity-triggered sorting strategy could be used for other nanoparticles with extremely high colloidalstability, which further widens the range of sortable nanoparticles. Furthermore, according to careful analysis of the changes in size, composition, quantum yield, and transient fluorescence of typical CDs in the post-separation fractions, it was concluded that the photoluminescence of the as-prepared hydrothermal carbonized CDs mainly arose from the particles\u2019 surface molecular state rather than their sizes.",

        "abstract": "Mass production of high-quality silver nanowires (Ag NWs) is of significant importance because of its potential applications in flexible transparent conductive devices. Halogen ions have been widely used for the synthesis of Ag NWs; however, owing to the lack of a deep insight into heterogeneous nucleation processes, usually a trace feeding amount (e.g. [Cl\u2013] u003c 0.25 mM) is used, which in turn lowers the concentration of precursor ([Ag+]). Here we systematically investigated the nucleation and growth behavior of Ag NWs and concluded that the number of heterogeneous nucleation sites was determined by the total surface area of AgCl seeds, which indicated a linear relationship between the concentrations of Ag+ and Cl\u2013 during precipitation. Based on this mechanism, we successfully produced high-quality Ag NWs with Ag+ concentrations which were 20 times higher for a polyol system and 5 times higher for an aqueous system as compared to that in the previously reported strategies. Besides, by tailoring the heterogeneous nucleation sites by controlling the size of the AgCl seeds, the diameters of the final Ag NWs could be well controlled even at high Ag+ concentration. Based on the mechanistic understandings, this synthetic strategy could be extended to other AgX-seeds (X = Br\u2013, I\u2013 and SO 4 2\u2013 ) and the basic principles can be applied to help rational synthesis of other high-yield metal NWs with tunable sizes.",

Study emphasizes the conceptual advances in classification, mechanism of DGUC and synthesis-structure-property relationships of NPs to provide the significant clue for the further synthesis optimization. Separation, concentration, and purification of NPs by DGUC can be achieved at the same time by introducing the water/oil interfaces into the separation chamber. We can develop an efficient method \u201clab in a tube\u201d by introducing a reaction zone or an assembly zone in the gradient to find the surface reaction and assembly mechanism of NPs since the reaction time can be precisely controlled and the chemical environment change can be extremely fast. Finally, to achieve the best separation parameters for the colloidal systems, we gave the mathematical descriptions and computational optimized models as a new direction for making practicable and predictable DGUC separation method. Thus, it can be helpful for an efficient separation as well as for the synthesis optimization, assembly and surface reactions as a potential cornerstone for the future development in the nanotechnology and this review can be served as a plethora of advanced notes on the DGUC separation method.",

        "abstract": "Density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGUC) has recently emerged as an effective nanoseparation method to sort polydispersed colloidal NPs mainly according to their size differences to reach monodispersed fractions (NPs), but its separation modeling is still lack and the separation parameters\u2019 optimization mainly based on experience of operators. In this paper, we gave mathematical descriptions on the DGUC separation, which suggested the best separation parameters for a given system. The separation parameters, including media density, centrifuge speed and time, which affected the separation efficiency, were discussed in details. Further mathematical optimization model was established to calculate and yield the \u201cbest\u201d (optimized) linear gradient for a colloidal system with given size and density. The practical experiment results matched well with theoretical prediction, demonstrating the DGUC method, an efficient, practical, and predictable separation technique with universal utilization for colloid sorting.",

Au nanoparticles are decorated onto the ZnOSi nanoflowers by the hydrothermal method. The formed AuZnONSPA array is evaluated as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering SERS-active substrate, which exhibits very high sensitivity and good stability and reproducibility. The excellent SERS enhancement is mainly attributed to the strong local electromagnetic effect which is associated with the unique flowerlike nanostructures of AuZnONSPA and the formed metal-induced gap states at the AuZnO interfaces. The results indicated that AuZnONSPA might be employed as a promising SERS substrate for the fast detection of low-concentration biomolecules. \u00a9 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Ag nanoparticles (NPs) coated with silica nanolayers were decorated onto a large-scale and uniform silicon nanowire array (SiNWA) by simple chemical etching and metal reduction processes. The three-dimensional Ag/SiNWAs thus formed are employed as a substrate for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and a detection limit for rhodamine 6G as low as 10-16 M and a Raman enhancement factor as large as 1014 were obtained. Simulation results show that two kinds of inter-Ag-NP nanogaps in three-dimensional geometry create a huge number of SERS 'hot spots' where electromagnetic fields are substantially amplified, contributing to the higher SERS sensitivity and lower detection limit. The excellent SERS stability of Ag/SiNWAs is attributed to the presence of the SiO2 nanolayer around Ag NPs that prevented the Ag NP surface from being oxidized. The calibration of the Raman peak intensities of rhodamine 6G and thiram allowed their quantitative detection. Our finding is a significant advance in developing SERS substrates for the fast and quantitative detection of trace organic molecules. \u00a9 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Hierarchical ZnO/Si nanoheterostructure was prepared by growing oriented ZnO nanowire bundles onto the top of nanoporous silicon pillar array (NSPA) via a self-catalytic thermal evaporation and vapor-phase transport method. Samples were carefully characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and luminescence spectroscopy. One ultraviolet, one blue-green, and two red emission bands were observed in ZnO/NSPA, and the emission mechanism is discussed by developing a model-based energy band diagram. The origins of the ultraviolet and blue-green photoluminescence (PL) bands were attributed to the emission from the band edge transition and surface states of oxygen vacancies of ZnO, while two red PL bands originated from NSPA and could be well explained by the quantum confinement-luminescence center model. The realization of such all solid and wide wavelength nanodevice might be both meaningful for developing new concept lighting devices and potentially extended to fabricate hierarchical Si-based nanoheterostructures in fabricating other optoelectronic nanodevices.

        "abstract": "A flexible, transparent, chemical gas sensor is assembled from a transparent conducting film of carbon nanotube (CNT) networks that are coated with hierarchically nanostructured polyaniline (PANI) nanorods. The nanocomposite film is synthesized by in-situ, chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline in a functional multiwalled CNT (FMWCNT) suspension and is simultaneously deposited onto a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. An as-prepared flexible transparent chemical gas sensor exhibits excellent transparency of 85.0% at 550 nm using the PANI/FMWCNT nanocomposite film prepared over a reaction time of 8 h. The sensor also shows good flexibility, without any obvious decrease in performance after 500 bending/extending cycles, demonstrating high-performance, portable gas sensing at room temperature. This superior performance could be attributed to the improved electron transport and collection due to the CNTs, resulting in reliable and efficient sensing, as well as the high surface-to-volume ratio of the hierarchically nanostructured composites. The excellent transparency, improved sensing performance, and superior flexibility of the device, may enable the integration of this simple, low-cost, gas sensor into handheld flexible transparent electronic circuitry and optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Transparent and conductive film based electronics have attracted substantial research interest in various wearable and integrated display devices in recent years. The breakdown of transparent electronics prompts the development of transparent electronics integrated with healability. A healable transparent chemical gas sensor device is assembled from layer-by-layer-assembled transparent healable polyelectrolyte multilayer films by developing effective methods to cast transparent carbon nanotube (CNT) networks on healable substrates. The healable CNT network-containing film with transparency and superior network structures on self-healing substrate is obtained by the lateral movement of the underlying self-healing layer to bring the separated areas of the CNT layer back into contact. The as-prepared healable transparent film is assembled into healable transparent chemical gas sensor device for flexible, healable gas sensing at room temperature, due to the 1D confined network structure, relatively high carrier mobility, and large surface-to-volume ratio. The healable transparent chemical gas sensor demonstrates excellent sensing performance, robust healability, reliable flexibility, and good transparency, providing promising opportunities for developing flexible, healable transparent optoelectronic devices with the reduced raw material consumption, decreased maintenance costs, improved lifetime, and robust functional reliability.",

The hierarchical nanocomposite film is obtained via aniline polymerization in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) solution and simultaneous deposition on flexible PET substrate. The PANI nanoparticles (PPANI) anchored onto rGO surfaces (PPANI/rGO) and the PANI nanofiber (FPANI) are successfully interconnected and deposited onto flexible PET substrates to form hierarchical nanocomposite (PPANI/rGO-FPANI) network films. The assembled flexible, transparent electronic gas sensor exhibits high sensing performance towards NH3 gas concentrations ranging from 100 ppb to 100 ppm, reliable transparency (90.3% at 550 nm) for the PPANI/rGO-FPANI film (6 h sample), fast response/recovery time (36 s/18 s), and robust flexibility without an obvious performance decrease after 1000 bending/extending cycles. The excellent sensing performance could probably be ascribed to the synergetic effects and the relatively high surface area (47.896 m(2) g(-1)) of the PPANI/rGO-FPANI network films, the efficient artificial neural network sensing channels, and the effectively exposed active surfaces. It is expected to hold great promise for developing flexible, cost-effective, and highly sensitive electronic sensors with real-time analysis to be potentially integrated into wearable flexible electronics.

MoS with a nanoflake structure and chelation ability acts as a supporter for PDA films to enhance the porosity as well as the transparency of films, which increases the sensitivity, selectivity, and application potential of a PDA sensor. The PDA/MoS film sensor shows a linear detection range for N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) vapor from 0.01% to 4% with a visible blue to red color change detected by the naked eye, which is more sensitive than other organic vapors. Exploiting the high transparency, vivid color change, remarkable flexibility and reliability, a wearable wrist strap sensor device with visible DMF sensing ability is fabricated based on PDA/MoS films, indicating their great potential for smart wearable devices.",

For potentially coupled as energy storage modules in various flexible, transparent and portable electronics, the flexible transparent supercapacitors are developed and assembled from hierarchical nanocomposite films of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and aligned polyaniline (PANI) nanoarrays upon their synergistic advantages. The nanocomposite films are fabricated from in situ PANI nanoarrays preparation in a blended solution of aniline monomers and rGO onto the flexible, transparent, and stably conducting film (FTCF) substrate, which is obtained by coating silver nanowires (Ag NWs) layer with Meyer rod and then coating of rGO layer on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. Optimization of the transparency, the specific capacitance, and the flexibility resulted in the obtained all-solid state nanocomposite supercapacitors exhibiting enhanced capacitance performance, good cycling stability, excellent flexibility, and superior transparency. It provides promising application prospects for exploiting flexible, low-cost, transparent, and high-performance energy storage devices to be coupled into various flexible, transparent, and wearable electronic devices.",

The purification was performed using a two-phase solvent system composed of chloroform, methanol and water (4:4:2, V/V) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, when the rotation speed and the detection wavelength were set at 800 r/min and 254 nm, respectively. The results showed that five flavonoid compounds whose purities were 75.6%, 95.1%, 73.5%, 89.1% and 87.7%, respectively were obtained, and their masses were 21, 8, 11, 20 and 55 mg, respectively (obtained from 318 mg of dry crude flavonoid extract from Rosa roxburghii Tratt fruit).",

For this purpose, we synthesized polyacrylate/polyacrylate (PAC/PAC), polyacrylate/polyacrylamide (PAC/PAM), polyacrylamide/polyacrylamide (PAM/PAM) and polyacrylamide/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PAM/PVA) IPN hydrogels. The PAC/PAC IPN and PAC/PAM IPN hydrogels showed compressive strength of 70 and 160kPa, respectively. For the PAM/PAM IPN and PAM/PVA IPN hydrogels, they exhibited excellent tensile strength of 1.2 and 2.8MPa, and elongations at break of 1750% and 3300%, respectively. A strain relaxation was also observed in the case of PAM series IPN hydrogels. From FTIR, TGA and SEM measurements, we confirmed that physical entanglement, hydrogen bonds and chemical crosslinking played major roles in improving hydrogel strength and toughening. The two-step technique contributes to the understanding of ideal networks, provides a universal strategy for designing high mechanical strength hydrogels, and opening up the biomedical application of hydrogels.",

In this article, we designed a simple route to high-strength interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogel from polyacrylamide (PAAm) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH). The highest tensile strength and elongation were 2.4 Mpa and 4300 %, respectively. It was found that the hydrogel strength depended on the chemical crosslinking, physical entanglement and PVOH precipitates. Because of the hydrogen bonding interactions and self-crosslinking, the structure of PVOH transferred from crystal to amorphous. PVOH precipitates scattered in the crosslinked PAAm matrix which dispersed the stress and improved the hydrogel toughness. The simple method is versatile in synthesizing high-strength IPN hydrogels using many kinds of polymer species.",

In this article, we designed a high-strength hydrogel with an interpenetrating network (IPN) structure from polyacrylamide (PAM) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Synthesis parameters, such as PVA/AM mass ratio, crosslinker dosage and elongation time were carried out for high tensile strength and elongation. The results showed that chemical crosslinking, physical entanglement and PVA precipitates were the dominant parameters for the improvement of mechanical properties. The PVA structure transferred from crystal to amorphous due to intermolecular and intramolecular interactions (such as hydrogen bond and self-crosslinking). PVA precipitates scatterred in the brittle PAM matrix homogeneously which dispersed the applied stress and improved the hydrogel toughness. The tensile strength and elongation were extremely high, they were 2.4 MPa and 3100%, respectively. The simple method is versatile in synthesizing high-strength IPN hydrogels using many kinds of polymer species.",

Recently, PANi nanostructures including particles, rods, wires, tubes, fibers, and films, have received intense interest because of their physical and chemical properties differing from their macro-sized counterparts, which it is possible used in polymeric conducting molecular wires [4] , chemical sensors [5\u20138] , biosensors [9] , light-emitting and electronic devices [10,11] . The classical chemical synthesis of PANi uses aniline monomer, an oxidant, and a strong acid. The acid acts as a dopant to protonate PANi, which results in a conductive emeraldine salt, but anisotropic growth is often suppressed in such a system [12] . Recently, a variety of synthetic approaches, such as interfacial polymerization [6,13] , seeding polymerization [14] , rapidly mixed reaction [15] , dilute polymerization [16,17] , and template polymerization using porous materials [4,18] structural directing agents and oligomer [19\u201328] , have been developed for the synthesis of PANi nanostructure. These synthetic methods are limited to the formation of the preferred PANi nanostructure or PANi derivate fibers due to their highly anisotropic growth character along c axis. However, the above methods are moderate intricacy and the preparation of PANi derivate long fibers without templates still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a facile and high yield synthesis of centimeter-scaled PANi fibers by a low-temperature, environmentally benign, solution-phase approach in the presence of oligo-polyacrylamide (oligo-PAAm) as growth modifiers. The preparation conditions are investigated and the formation mechanism is proposed. 2 Experimental part 2.1 Materials Aniline monomer (ANI) and acrylamide monomer (AAm) were distilled under reduced pressure prior to use, respectively. Potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) as a radical initiator for the polymerization reaction of AAm to oligo-PAAm and the growth of ANI to PANi was purified by recrystallization from 66 wt.% ethanol/water solution. N , N \u2032-Methylene bisacrylamide (NMBA) was used as a crosslinker for preparation of PAAm. Inorganic hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used as the dopant for conducting PANi fibers. The above materials were all purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagents Co., China. 2.2 Growth of PANi fiber Typical PANi fiber was prepared by the following route. ANI of 1 ml was dissolved in an AAm solution with 5 g AAm and 15 ml HCl (1.0 M). The mixed solution was vacuum-degassed for 30 min. NMBA of 0.01 g and KPS of 2.97 g was added to the above mixed solution. Under an ambient atmosphere and stirring, aqueous oxidative polymerization reaction carried out at 80 \u00b0C for 30 min until all KPS dissolved and green jelly formed. The resultant colloid was immediately turned to an ice-cold vessel. After growth for 6 h, the fibroid products were separated, rinsed with acetic acid and vacuum dried. 2.3 Characterization The morphology of PANi fiber was observed by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a S-3500N, HiTACHI, mounting the sample on metal stub, coated with gold. The sample was identified by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) with a Nicolet Impact 410 FTIR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. The UV\u2013vis spectra of PANi powder and PANi fiber were measured by dissolving the samples in distilled water and recording with a UV-3100 UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). The chemical compositions of samples were identified by element analysis with a Vario EL III, Elementar Inc., Germany. The chemical compositions of the fiber was identified as about C:N:H = 9:2:10, which indicates that a molar ratio of PANi (C 6 H 5 N) to PAAm (C 3 H 5 NO) is 1:1 in the fiber. The conductivity of sample was determined by milling and pressing the sample in sheet (diameter: 13 mm, thickness: 1 mm) under 14 MPa with a Carver model C Press and measuring by using a standard four-probe method with a Keithley 196 System DMM digital multimeter. The resultant fibers show conductivity of 2\u20134 S cm \u22121 , which imply the formation of PANi in the samples. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Identification of the fiber FTIR spectra of PANi, PAAm and the PANi/PAAm fiber are shown in Fig.\u00a01 a . It can be seen that the line (i) is the superposition of the lines (ii) and (iii), in other words, the fiber consisted of PANi and PAAm. The absorption peak at 617 cm \u22121 is caused by the deformations of the benzene ring in PANi [28] . The band at 1114 cm \u22121 is assigned to a vibration mode of the \u2013NH + structure due to the protonation of amine group in PANi [29] . The peaks at 1400 cm \u22121 belongs to the C\u2013N bond from PAAm, the peak at 1662 cm \u22121 is a characteristic peak of carbonyl group in PAAm [30] . The absorption band at 3168 cm \u22121 is attributed to the N\u2013H bending in PAAm [31] . UV\u2013vis spectra of PANi/PAAm fiber (i) and PANi powder (ii) synthesized in the same conditions are shown in Fig.\u00a01 b. The PANi/PAAm fiber solution presents an emerald green color and homogeneous system. Three absorption peaks, 251, 384, and 828 nm are observed in PANi/PAAm fiber. The 251 nm peak arises from \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 \u2217 electron transition within the benzenoid segments, while the absorption peaks at 384 and 828 nm originate from the charged cationic species known as polarons [32] . These peaks indicate that PANi reacts with doped HCl in PANi/PAAm fiber and exists in its conducting form, i.e. emeraldine salt, which is similar to that obtained by either chemical or electrochemical methods. Compared with pure PANi powders, the polaron transition absorption band at 778 nm is red shifted to 828 nm for PANi/PAAm fiber, which is due to the lower energy band transition for PANi/PAAm fiber than that for PANi powder, and indicates a longer \u03c0 conjugation bond length in the centimeter-scaled PANi/PAAm fiber than in PANi powder. The longer \u03c0 conjugation bond in the PANi/PAAm fiber is available to enhance the conductivity of PANi/PAAm fiber. Because the polymerization conditions for ANI is similar to the conditions for AAm, considering the monomer/initiator ratio and reaction conditions in our experimental, it is suggested that a copolymerization between ANI and AAm monomers takes place to form PANi/PAAm copolymers. However, the mechanism of the copolymerization must be studied further. The chemical composition, conductivity and presented color of the resultant fiber further confirm the formation of PANi/PAAm. 3.2 The morphology and mechanism As shown in Fig.\u00a02 a , in an optimized condition, the resultant PANi/PAAm fibers have a cross-section of hexagonal prism, diameters of 200\u2013400 \u03bcm, and length varying from millimeters to several centimeters, and the longest fiber is about 6 cm. The longest fiber grows in an AAm concentration of 0.33 g ml \u22121 . With increasing of AAm concentration, the length and diameter of product decrease rapidly ( Fig.\u00a02 b). Accordingly, we obtain a simple method to control the size (length and diameter) of PANi/PAAm fibers. The morphology of PANi/PAAm fiber depends on reactant and medium. When no AAm monomer or AAm concentration lower than 0.25 g ml \u22121 in the reaction system, spherical nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 100 to 300 nm are obtained ( Fig.\u00a03 a ). When the concentration of HCl is 2.0 M, the resulting PANi product is serrated lamella ( Fig.\u00a03 b). From the above, the AAm concentration is a key factor influencing the morphology of the fiber. It is well know that polymer can be used as template to fiber growth [33] . Under a higher AAm concentration, AAm monomers crosslink to form three-dimensional PAAm network [34,35] , which cannot be used as a template to grow PANi fiber. Contrarily, under a lower AAm concentration, AAm monomers cannot crosslink effectively and only exist in small molecules, which PANi fiber also cannot grow. Under a suitable AAm concentration, the AAm monomers are bond to form one-dimensional PAAm chains, which act as the in-situ generated seeds in directing the fibriform morphology of the final product. This explanation is different from Zhang et\u00a0al. [36,37] that PANi nanofibers prepared in chemical oxidative polymerization with an oxidant were resulted from the rod-like structure of oxidant ion clusters formed during the induction period. 3.3 Conductivity and yield Fig.\u00a04 a shows the dependence of conductivity and yield of PANi/PAAm fibers on KPS dosage (HCl concentration at 1.0 M). The conductivity of fiber increases with the increase of KPS dosage in the range of 0.6\u20131.0 (mol KPS /mol ANI ), beyond a molar ratio of 1.0, the conductivity decreases. KPS is an initiator for the polymerization of AAm and an oxidant for PANi. A smaller KPS dosage is not enough to construct PAAm chain, while high concentration of KPS will cause an overoxidation of PANi chains and the intense polymerization of AAm (to form 3D PAAm, instead of 1D PAAm chain). Accordingly, to obtain the highest conductivity of the fiber, a molar ratio of KPS to ANI of 1 has been experimentally determined to be better. KPS has a similar influence on the yield of PANi fiber as on the conductivity, but the maximum yield appears at the molar ratio of KPS to ANI at 1.2 ( Fig.\u00a04 a). It is well known that the conductivity depends on the length of PANi fiber, and the yield depends on the quantity of PANi fiber. In the KPS dosage range from the molar ratio 1.0 to 1.2, the length of PANi fiber decrease and the quantity of the fiber increase due to the overoxidation for PANi chain and the formation of crosslinked PAAm by KPS. Once the KPS dosage exceeds the molar ratio of 1.2, both conductivity and yield of PANi fiber increase with the increase of KPS dosage. Fig.\u00a04 b shows the dependence of conductivity and yield of PANi/PAAm fibers on HCl concentration (molar ratio for KPS to AAm at 1:1). The conductivity of PANi/PAAm comes from the protonated PANi, higher HCl concentration results in the more protonated PANi and higher conductivity. Therefore, the conductivity of the PANi/PAAm fibers increases from 9.36 \u00d7 10 \u22124 to about 3.7 S cm \u22121 when the HCl concentration changes from 0.1 to 1.5 M ( Fig.\u00a04 b). Similar phenomena were also found by Kang et\u00a0al. [3] . On the other hand, the yield of PANi/PAAm fiber increases with the increase HCl concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 M. Beyond the concentration of 1.0 M, the yield decreases with the increase of HCl concentration. The oxidative polymerization mechanism of PANi has been investigated widely. According to most authors [3] , the formation of PANi fibers has an optimized pH condition. HCl concentration at 1.0 M has been experimentally determined by us to be better. 4 Conclusion In summary, a centimeter-scaled PANi fiber is synthesized by an aqueous oxidative polymerization of ANi monomers in the presence of oligo-AAm. The fibers are validated as PANi/PAAm copolymers and PANi exist in high conductive emeraldine salt state. The morphology, conductivity and yield of the copolymer can be devised by controlling the feed compositions and preparation conditions without templates. Under polymerization conditions: M AM / W ANI at 5.0, W NMBA / W AM = 0.001, V ANI / V HCl (1.5M) = 1:15, reacted at 80 \u00b0C for 30 min; and growth at 0 \u00b0C for 6 h, a hexagonal PANi/PAAm fiber with conductivity of 3.7 S cm \u22121 and length of 6 cm is obtained. It is suggested that the oligo-acrylamide acted as in-situ seeds directs the fibriform morphology of the fiber.

        "abstract": "Background China has seen a proliferation of entertainment centres that are frequented by business people. Employees at these centres often are young, female rural-to-urban migrants who may be vulnerable to sexual violence and exploitation. Methods: Data for this study were collected using a self-administered survey among male and female employees in two high-end entertainment centres in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. We used logistic regression to examine predictors of violent and potentially exploitative experiences (partner violence, forced sex and transactional sex). Predictors included gender, ever having a same-sex partner, migration variables and employment characteristics. Results: Participants reported high levels of partner violence (16.0% ever and 9.0% in the past 3 months) and forced sex (13.9% ever and 5.5% in the past 3 months). Nineteen percent reported sex work in the past 3 months. In the multivariate regressions, ever having had a same-sex partner was associated with higher odds of ever having experienced partner violence (odds ratio (OR)\u22647.8, P<0.001), partner violence in the past 3 months (OR\u22649.0, P<0.001), ever having had transactional sex (OR\u22646.0, P<0.001) and transactional sex in the past 3 months (OR\u22645.2, P\u22640.001). After adjusting for transactional sex, the association between having had a same-sex partner and partner violence remained significant. Neither gender nor migration status was associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusion: High-end entertainment centre workers in China are at risk for sexual violence and should be targeted with employment-based interventions. \u00a9 2013 CSIRO.",

        "abstract": "China's family planning program focuses on younger women. Women older than 50 years, especially those in rural areas, are ineligible for free services and often have few other care options. Few studies have examined the sexual and reproductive health demands and unmet needs of these women.This cross-sectional, interviewer-administered survey included 1,652 rural women aged 50 to 64 years from seven provinces in China. We examined women's sexual and reproductive health status, knowledge, and service demands, and whether they still had an intrauterine device (IUD).Educational levels were low, and most were rural farmers or housewives. The mean age at menopause was 48.9 years, and 52.4% reported climacteric symptoms. The mean frequency of sex in the last month was 1.8 times. About 47.4% of women had undergone a gynecological examination during the past 2 years. The first choice for care was family planning clinics (31.2%) followed by township hospitals (28.4%). Identified service needs included women's health check-ups (56.5%), sexual health knowledge (54.4%), women's health knowledge (35.4%), menopause counseling (34.8%), and IUD removal after menopause (17.0%). Among 519 postmenopausal women who used an IUD, 19.1% had not had it removed. On multivariate regression, awareness of correct time for IUD removal, beliefs about sex after menopause, receiving formal health education, and undergoing gynecological examination were significantly associated with having had IUD removal.A large proportion of middle-aged women in rural China lack sexual and reproductive health services, including IUD removal after menopause. A comprehensive program of sexual and reproductive health services is needed for middle-aged women in rural China.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale internal migration in China may be an important mechanism for the spread of HIV/sexually transmitted infections (STIs) because of the risk behaviours of migrants. We conducted a self-administered survey among 724 employees of a high-end entertainment centre in Kunshan, Jiangsu Province, China. Using logistic regression, we examined the association of hometown of origin (Kunshan city, elsewhere in Jiangsu Province, or another province in China) and consecutive years living in Kunshan with measures of HIV/STI risk behaviour. We found that increased time living in Kunshan was associated with lower odds of using condoms as contraception [odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-0.95] and consistent condom use with a casual partner (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.93), after controlling for gender, marital status age and income. The odds of having had an STI were significantly lower for Kunshan natives than those originally from outside provinces (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.07-0.96), but increasing years living in Kunshan was not related to lower risk for an STI. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that migrants living far from home participate in higher risk behaviour than locals. Findings suggest that adaptation to local culture over time may increase HIV/STI risk behaviours, a troublesome finding. \u00a9 The Author 2010.",

It was found that irradiation intensity plays an important role in enhancing the TOC removal. The efficiency of photo-Fenton process is promoted by adding potassium-oxalate. Separate addition of H2O2 to reaction mixture results in the increase of mineralization efficiency and the reduction of Fe(II) demand. Oxygen is advantageous for dechlorination while aeration is unnecessary. Up to 63% of TOC can be removed in the reaction for 30 min under following conditions: [H2O2]=1000 mg/L,[Fe(II)]=100 mg/L, pH=3.0 and t=30\u00b0C. The photo-Fenton reaction has been proved to be highly effective for the treatment of effluents with about 185 mg/L TOC.",

Analysis with ultrafiltration membrane of the change of thihalomathanes formation potential (THMFP) with different molecular weights shows that most small molecule materials have been chlorinated into THMs. After preoxidation of chlorine dioxide, THMFPs with different molecular weights have decreased and most macromolecular materials have changed into small molecule materials, which were difficult to react with chlorine to generate THMs. Experimental results show that THM formation is related to both the molecular weight and molecular structure.

The results of the test showed that,for the raw water of the test, 4 mg/L of available chlorine was added, the removal efficiency of CODMn reached about 20 % after 30 min of oxidation, and then through the enhanced coagulation, the removal efficiency of CODMn reached about 50 %. Chlorination first was superior to coagulation first for the effect of the CODMn removal. The case was on the contrary to UV254 removal, but with the increase of the available chlorine added the removal effects were almost the same.",

Different types of inclusions with remarkably varied vapor/liquid ratios exist together, implying that boiling might have occurred during mineralization. Microthermometric measurement of the fluid inclusions show that the ice melting temperatures range from -0.3\u2103 to -4.7\u2103, and the corresponding salinities vary from 0.48 wt % to 7.39 wt% NaCleq. The homogenization temperatures range from 133\u2103 to 304\u2103, with densities from 0.70 to 0.98 g/cm3. Isotopic analyses show that \u03b4DH2O and \u03b418OH2O values of the ore-forming fluids are -81.0\u2030 to -90.0\u2030 and 0.1\u2030 to 2.3\u2030, respectively, indicating that the ore-forming fluids are composed mainly of meteoric water, probably with the involvement of magmatic fluids. Carbon isotopic composition of hydrothermal calcites form the ore veins (\u03b413Ccalcite) are -1.2\u2030\uff5e2.9\u2030, suggesting that carbon in the ore-forming fluids was derived from carbonate sediments in the basement rocks. Geological characteristics, ore-forming fluid geochemistry and alteration assemblage suggest that the Guanshan Cu-Pb-Au deposit might be a high sulfidation type epithermal polymetallic deposit, and boiling seems likely to be the main factor for the deposition of ore solutions.",

The metallogenesis process can be divided into two epochs and four stages, viz., ductile shear metamorphic metallogenesis epoch of ductile shear metamorphic metallogenesis stage and hydrothermal alteration metallogenesis epoch of gold quartz vein stage, gold sulfides stage and galena\u2014sphalerite\u2014carbonate vein stage. Gold mineralization occurred mainly in the gold quartz vein stage and the gold sulfide stage. SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating show that the core and mantle ages of zircons from wallrock migmatite that hosted the deposit are 343.9~ 1732Ma,representing the source rock age for protolith of migmatite. The average age of the marginal zone ages of inherited zircons and the newly grown zircons in migmatite is 239.6\u00b13.9Ma,belonging to the Indosinian period,and representing the age of migmatic metamorphism, which also corresponds with the times of the North\u2014South China and Indochina\u2013South China collision, and approves the occurrence of migmatic metamorphism in South China in the Indosinian epoch. The age of ductile share metamorphic mineralization is younger than the migmatite metamorphism age of 239.6\u00b13.9Ma. The zircons from sulfide-rich gold-bearing quartz vein have high common Pb concentration, 0.65~2.27%, the range of Th/U ration is narrow, 0.306~0.557, and the age is 152.5\u00b13.1Ma, belonging to the Yanshanian epoch, and representing the age of the main mineralization epoch of the Hetai gold deposit.",

        "abstract": "The collisional processes established many paleo-mountain belts are commonly divided by many geologists into two simple, but distinct stages, i.e., syn-collisional and post-collisional periods, as the transition from late- to post-collisional is not clear and the definition of post- and late-collisions also is blurring. However, the tectonic evolution of the Tibetan orogen underwent a complicate history, which is divided into (1) syn-collisional (65\uff5e41 Ma), (2) late-collisional(40\uff5e26 Ma); and (3) post-collisional (25\uff5e0 Ma) periods. The orogeny during the late-collisional period generally happened in a compressional regime resulted from successional convergence between Indian and Asian continents, and is characterized by intra-continental subduction (underthrust), crustal shortening, large-scale thrusting and strike-slip faulting systems developed in the margins of the Tibetan plateau, which resulted in the development of potassic porphyry stocks and carbonatite-alkalic complexes in the eastern Tibet and potassic-ultrapotassic volcanic rocks in the northern Tibet. At least four significant metallogenic events, associated with the late-collsional orogeny, have been recognized in the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau, a tectonic transformation belt. They are: (1) the porphyry Cu-Mo(-Au) mineralization related to large-scale strike-slip faults system, which controlled the localization of the Yulong porphyry Cu belt (40\uff5e36 Ma) in east Tibet, (2) the REE mineralization associated with carbonatite-alkalic complexes, formed the Mianning-Dechang REE belt (40\uff5e27 Ma) in the western Sichuan, (3) the Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization controlled by thrust faulting systems, formed at least two large-sized Pb-Zn-Ag deposits (40\uff5e30 Ma) in the Lanping strike-slip pull-apart basin, western Yunnan, and (4) the Au mineralization related to large-scale shearing, which produced the Ailaoshan Au belts composed of numerous shear-type or orogenic-type Au deposits in the western Sichuan and Yunnan. These data indicate that the late-collisional metallogensis in the Tibetan orogen were mainly developed in an intra-continental transformation orogenic sdetting, characterized by a series of large-scale strike-slip faulting, thrusting, and shearing systems developed in the late-collisional period. Available data suggest that the metallogensis is probably controlled by a shared deep lithospheric process, most likely related to upwelling of the asthenosphere triggered by face to face subduction of the Yangtze and Lhasa blocks (continental slabs) in the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau during the late-collisional period.",

        "abstract": "Jinbaoshan which contains large amounts of chromites and has high Cr content(about 0.5%) is the largest independent Pt-Pd deposit which consists mainly of olivine and clinopyroxenite.Ores are sparsely disseminated and have a small amount of PGE-enriched sulfides.The ores and ultrabasic wall rocks have similar trace elements,REE and PGE parameters and similar primitive mantle normalized patterns,implying that their parent magmas were alike.Samples from Jinbaoshan rock body have similar Cu/Pd and Cu/Pt ratios(\u2264 the value of primitive mantle).The ultrabasic wall rocks have high Pd/Ir and Ni/Cu ratios and Pb negative anomalies;on the contrary,the Pt-Pd ores have low Pd/Ir and Ni/Cu ratios as well as Pb positive anomalies.These data show that the parent magma of the ores had low S saturation,whereas the parent magma of the ultrabasic wall rocks was probably formed on the geochemical interface of S saturation related to Emeishan mantle plume.Ore magmas containing a little PGE-enriched sulfides were probably injected into the unconsolidated ultrbasic rocks which had intruded earlier,forming the quasi-bedded ore body.The low S saturation of Emeishan mantle plume in the early stage and high partition coefficient of PGE in the sulfide/silicate phases seem to be the essential factors responsible for high PGE and low Ni-Cu content of the Jinbaoshan deposit.Jinbaoshan is one of the rarely found rock bodies which have lower Cu/Pd and Cu/Pt ratios than the value of primitive mantle in China,implying that the magma of Jinbaoshan has experienced a procedure of PGE enrichment.The basic-ultrabasic intrusive body located close to the eruption center of Emeishan basalt seems to be one of the best hopeful areas in search for PGE deposits.",

        "abstract": "There exist lots of basic-ultrabasic rock bodies in the Caiziyuan laterite type nickel deposit in Huili County of Sichuan Province.Geochemical characteristics of Platinum group elements(PGEs) and Re-Os isotope of three peridotites rock bodies are reported in this paper.The lithogeochemistry of the Caiziyuan deposit shows high MgO and low SiO2,Al2O3,Na2O and K2O content as well as high Mg# values.CIPW calculation indicates that the main standard minerals of the Caiziyuan deposit are composed of olivines and hypersthenes(the volume fraction is more than 90 percent),showing that the Caiziyuan deposit belongs to magnesia harzburgite type.The \u2211PGE of the Caiziyuan deposit is relatively lower than that of most mantle residual peredotites,implying that PGE was extracted by the sulfides in the basic magma resulting from the large melt fractions of mantle at the early stage.The differentiation between PPGE and IPGE in the Caiziyuan deposit is obvious,and is similar to things of mantle residual peridotites at the bottom of normal ophiolite suites reported earlier.The right-oblique mantle normalized PGE patterns are controlled mainly by the high partial melting of the mantle.Pt is concentrated relative to Pd in PPGE,and the differentiation between Pt and Pd might have been caused by obvious hydrothermal alteration;therefore a small amount of Pt probably exists in the form of residue alloy in Caiziyuan peridotites.The small \u03b3(Os) values imply that Caiziyuan peridotites were derived from the mantle with a fine Re-Os isotope sealing system.The petrogeochemistry,platinum group elements and Re-Os isotopic geochemistry suggest that the Caiziyuan deposit was derived directly from the mantle,thus belonging to the residual harzburgite at the bottom of the normal ophiolite suite.Caiziyuan ophiolite may be a part of the relics of ancient ocean floor of small ocean basin,implying that Kunyang rift was evolved into small ocean basin where Huili Group was deposited in the late period of Mesoproterzoic.The ophiolitic characteristics of the Caiziyuan deposit further prove that the Huili Group collided with Dongchuan and Tangdan Group in the south of Caiziyuan-Caimashui-Matang fault belt at the end of Mesoproterozoic,and that the basement in the southwest of Yangtze craton was probably collided and collaged by small continental segments in different periods,resulting in the basal continental crustal accretion.",

        "abstract": "This study conducted SHRIMP U-Pb age analyses for zircons from Caiyuanzi granites of two granitic bodies in the central Kangdian area,Sichuan,SW China,yielding the two ages of 1040.4\u00b16.1 Ma(MSWD=0.53,n=18) and 1063.2\u00b16.9 Ma(MSWD=1.15,n=11),which are highly in accordance with the time of the global Grenvillian orogenic movement.The Caiyuanzi granites are characterized by high SiO2(ave.74.96%),peraluminous(most A/CNK values higher than 1.1),medium alkali contents(ave.Na2O+K2O content of 6.5%),and low MgO(ave.0.17%),low TiO2(ave.0.28%),low CaO(ave.0.09%).They are also low in \u2211REE contents with an average \u2211REE of 36.99\u00d710-6(14 samples),an average LREE/HREE value of 3.34,a(La/Yb)N value of 8.57 and a \u03b4Eu value of 0.41.The chondrite-normalized REE pattern displays flat right dipping curves.The large ion lithophile elements,such as Rb,Th,U,and La are relatively enriched,whereas Ba,Eu and high HFSE,such as Nb,Zr and Ti,are relatively depleted.These characteristics show that the Caiyuanzi granites are typical S-type remelt granite.The geochemical features of the Caiyuanzi granites imply that material source is the paragneiss consisting mainly of pelite with minor sandstone.Calculation also shows that the melt of Caiyuanzi granites formed in an intraplate extension environment with a depth of 25 km and a temperature of 850\u2103 after the collision of blocks in the upper-middle crust and experienced strong differentiation of biotite and plagioclase.At the end of the mid-Proterozoic,the Dongchuan and Tangdan groups subducted northward along with Caiziyuan-Caimashui-Matang fault belt and collided with the Huili Group,resulting in the emplacement of Caiziyuan ophiolite and Caiyuanzi granite,and the eruption of the Tianbaoshan Formation intermediate-acidic volcanic rocks.The collision and collage mountain-building process maybe take place contemporaneously in Dongchuan and Kunyang groups in central Yunan province.The basement of the western margin of the Yangtze craton may be the result of accretion and expansion of the continental crust due to collision and collage of small blocks in different epochs and experienced a process of multiple extensions and collisions.",

        "abstract": "Mojiang is a lagre-size Au-Ni deposit occurring in the contact zone between ultramafic intrusions and metasedimentary rocks. It was previously considered to be a typical fault-controlled hydrothermal deposit. Systematically sampling and analysis show that the PGE contents are quite low in both Au-Ni and Ni ores, and the \u2211PGE is (2.58\uff5e109.66)\u00d710 -9, quite similar to that of the ultramafic intrusions \u3014(14.58 \uff5e 50.48)\u00d710 -9\u3015. Besides, the ores and the ultramafic intrusions possess similar chondrite-normalized patterns, i.e., both of them belong to Pt and Ir depleted and Ru and Rh enriched type, suggesting that the Mojiang mine has an identical source of PGE and most of them were derived from the ultramafic intrusions. The Pd/Ir ratios of the Mojiang ores are 0.18\uff5e10.0, much lower than those of typical hydrothermal Ni deposits (>100) and similar to those of the typical magmatic type Ni deposits, implying that the Ni ores in the Mojiang mine mainly belong to the magmatic type, and that the post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration might have not played an important role in the Ni mineralization. It is thus concluded that the Mojiang deposit is a composite deposit composed mainly of early stage magmatic type Ni ores and late stage hydrothermal type Au-Ni ores. The ultramafic intrusions in the Mojiang mine were derived directly from the mantle, being products of partial melting of a depleted mantle in different degrees. The mantle in Mojiang area underwent extraction of mafic magma and metasomatism, and the primary ultramafic magma was sulfur saturated.",

In the CCSD profile, with increasing depth, the\u03b418O of the quartz veins vary greatly and are in the form of \"\u2211\" , which show very low values at depth of 900m to 1500m and 2700m, and high values at depth of 1770m and 4000m, implying that the water/rock interactions between the protoliths and the meteoric water before subduction were controlled by heats and contact metamorphism associated with the local magmatic intrusions. The vertical variation of the CCSD quartz veins's\u03b418O are similar to those of the rock-forming minerals of the HP-UHP metamorphic rocks, suggesting that the quartz veins probably underwent HP, even UHP metamorphism, but most of them were formed by decompression-recrystallization and retrograde metamorphism of the CCSD HP-UHP metamorphic rocks. The great inhomogeneous distribution of the\u03b418O of quartz veins in the CCSD and in the outcropped HP-UHP metamorphic rocks, as well as the big crystals in the Donghai County, suggests that the metamorphic fluids expelled from the HP-UHP metamorphic rocks during the exhumation were locally migrated at the grain scale. Besides, the similarities of\u03b4D-\u03b418O compositions between the Donghai crystals and the CCSD quartz veins imply that they possess similar genesis and mainly formed during exhumation of the subducted plate in the Late Triassic Epoch.",

In order to probe into their REE geochemical characteristics in different oceanic areas of the Pacific Ocean, the authors collected samples from eastern Pacific basin, central Pacific Ocean and western Pacific Ocean and examined REE characteristics by means of ICP-AES. There are obvious positive Ce anomalies, rich LREE (light REE) and high total REE (XlREE) in the crusts. In contrast, there are rich HRjEE (heave REE) and relatively low X REE in the nodules, Ce anomalies have different styles, such as positive, negative and indistinct anomalies caused by different genetic types of nodules. The \"M\" type tetrad effects of nodules indicate that the nodules have suffered diagenesis, while the crusts have not been subjected to this effect. There exist different modes of occurrence of REE in nodules and crusts in different oceanic areas. REE in the crusts from central Pacific Ocean and in the nodules from eastern Pacific Ocean probably exist in the Fe-mineral phase, whereas REE in the crusts from western Pacific Ocean might exist in the Mn-mineral phase. REE in the nodules and crusts might have been mainly derived from seawater and seamount altered basalt respectively, with limited hydrothermal contribution.",

These age data are very similar to ages (33~34 Ma) of the lamprophyre dykes, which are extensively distributed in the Ailaoshan gold belt, suggesting that gold mineralization of the Daping mine was closely related to the Cenozoic lamprophyre dykes, which were generated by partial melting of the upper mantle. From early of the Cenozoic Era, upwelling of the Moho and partially melted upper mantle caused by crustal extension and strong ductile deformation resulted in formation and intrusion of large amounts of lamprophyre dykes. The mantle-derived fluids formed by the upper mantle degassing and the CO_2-riching fluids from the lower crust released by dehydration and roasting triggered by the rising hot mantle magma\u2019s heat mixed and migrated up along micro-fractures in the shear zone, and reacted with the mylonitized and sericitized diorite around rock, and finally deposited the ore minerals in the brittle structures of the shear zone because of water-rock interaction and boiling.",

        "abstract": "Noble gases isotopic compositions of fluid inclusions in major rock-forming minerals in HP-UHP metamorphic rocks collected from the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD) were analysed by using a high vacuum gas mass spectrum. The results show that the ~ 3 He/ ~ 4 He ratios are (0.004~0.775) 10~ -6 , and the corresponding R/R_a are 0.003~0.553; The ~ 40 Ar/ ~ 36 Ar ratios are 316.2~11358.8, much higher than that of the air (295.5). ~ 20 Ne/ ~ 22 N and ~ 21 Ne/ ~ 22 Ne are 9.47~12.4 and 0.026~0.051 respectively, and the respective ~ 134 Xe/ ~ 132 Xe and ~ 136 Xe/ ~ 132 Xe are 0.376~0.484 and 0.324~0.416, all higher than their corresponding values of the air. He-Ar, Ne and Xe isotopic compositions suggest that the ore-forming fluid of the fluid inclusions in the CCSD HP-UHP rocks were composed mainly of crustal fluid and a little air-saturated water, while the mantle-derived fluid was nearly absent. In the fluid inclusions, the He derived predominantly from the crust, the Ar are composed mainly of crustal radiogenic ~ 40 Ar and about one third air Ar. A little amount of Ne and Xe might derive from the mantle. The characteristics of F~ 40 Ar<F~ 84 Kr<F~ 132 Xe of CCSD HP-UHP rocks suggests that rapid decompression and boiling might have been happened in the crustal fluid during plate exhumation. The noble gas isotopic compositions imply that the subduction and exhumation of the CCSD HP-UHP rocks may be very quick, thus the mantle-crust interaction and isotopic exchange might be very limited.",

        "abstract": "Noble gases abundances and isotopic compositions of various layers in the three-layered Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts and their substrate rocks, which were collected from Magellan seamounts in west Pacific, were analyzed by using a high vacuum gas mass spectrum, and the results show that: 1. Most of the ferromanganese crusts in the west Pacific Ocean were hydrogenous origin and the noble gases in the crusts derived from different sources. The He was sourced predominantly from extraterrestrial grains such as interplanetary dust particles(IDPs), with a little from aeolian continental dust grains in the seawater. The Ar derived mainly from the air dissolved in the ambient sea water, and partly from the aeolian dust grains or formation water in the submarine sediments. While the Xe and Ne were mostly sourced from dissolved air in the sea water, and partly from the interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). (2) In the three-layered crusts, the compact layers possess quite different noble gases isotopic compositions compared with the outer and porous layers, suggesting that marine phosphatization might have greatly modified the noble gases isotopic compositions in the old crusts, resulting in dramatic increase of 4He concentrations and decrease of3 He/4 He. (3) 3He/4 He ratios in the basaltic substrates of the Cobalt-rich crusts are very low, varying between 0.0095Ra to 0.074Ra, which are similar to that of the phosphorite substrates (0.087Ra), but much lower than those of normal submarine basalts, suggesting that the basaltic substrates might have been strongly reacted with radiogenic 4He and P enriching upwelling marine currents or formation water in the sediments. Large amount of ore-forming elements might have been released during basalt/water interaction and which might favor growth of the Cobalt-rich crusts. The relative low 3He/4 He ratios in the basaltic substrates may be used as one of the important exploration criterions for the Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.",

        "abstract": "Concentration of platinum group elements(PGE) of various gold ores and around rocks and Re-Os isotopic compositions of major ore minerals of Daping gold deposit were analyzed by using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry(ICP-MS) with nickel sulfide fire assay pre-concentration and carius tube decomposing technique with acetone extracted Re method. The results show that the total PGE (\u03a3PGE) in the gold ores are greatly varied, varying between 3.91 \u00d710-9 to 61.64\u00d710-9 and averaging 25.93\u00d710-9, which are similar to that of the Himalayan lamprophyre dykes(22.19\u00d710-9) and much higher than those of the Caledonian diorite around rocks ((2.79~4.75)\u00d710-9). Parameter Pt/Pt* of the gold ores are 0.01~0.9, with an average of 0.249, closing to that of the lamprophyre dykes (0.45), and much lower than those of the diorite (1.38~1.57). Chondrite normalized patterns of the gold ores show marked negative Pt and Ir and positive Ru and Rh anomalies, which are also similar to that of the lamprophyre dykes but obviously different from those of the diorite, suggesting that gold mineralization was closey related to the lamprophyre intrusion, and the ore-forming materials didn't derive mainly from the diorite. Element ratios of the PGE show that the lamprophyre dykes was formed by partial melting of a depleted mantle which had undergone extraction of mafic magma and metasomatism, and the primary magma was sulfur saturated. Re/Os ratios of the ore minerals are quite high, varying between 6.36 to 121.67, and \u03b3Os(t) are 290.21~810.24, averaging 492.92. Besides,187Os/188Os(t) of the ore minerals are 0.495~1.154, which are much higher than the initial 187Os/188Os ratio of chondrite (0.12679) at the gold metallogenic age(33.55Ma), implying that crust-derived radiogenic 187Os might have been added during gold mineralization. PGE geochemistry and Re-Os isotopic compositions indicate that genesis of the Daping gold deposit was closely related to strong crust-mantle interaction in the Ailaoshan area since the Cenozoic era, and the ore-forming fluids was mixture of the mantle-derived fluids formed by the upper mantle degassing and the CO2-riching fluids from the lower crust released by dehydration and roasting triggered by the rising hot mantle magma's heat. The shear zone provided channel for fluid migration and mixing, and the ore-forming fluids migrated up along micro-fractures in the shear zone, reacted with the diorite, and finally deposited the ore minerals in the brittle structures of the shear zone because of water-rock interaction and boiling. Thus, the Daping is a typical shear zone controlled mesothermal gold deposit.",

        "abstract": "Rare earth elements (REEs) and trace elements compositions of ferromanganese crusts collected from North-West Pacific seamounts were analyzed by using an in-situ laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICAPMS).The results show that records of elements composition of ferromanganese crusts differ significantly between localities even though they have similar oceanographic settings and three-layered structures.Most of these samples show high total REE concentrations(XREE),high LREE/ HREE,marked positive Ce anomaly (\u03b4Ce) and non- or weakly positive Eu anomaly (\u03b4Eu),suggesting that most of them were of hydrogenetic origin.The REE compositions are quite different among various layers in the crusts,which probably results from their different growth environments and different mineral assemblages.Tn sample 0327,the \u03a3 REE vary widely over three layers and increasing from inner to outer layers.The values of \u03b4Ce and Y/Ho in inner layer of sample 0327 are quite high and varies dramatically, with maximums of 38.61 and 105.3 respectively.This shows that growth environment of inner layer of sample 0327 was much more turbulent and oxidized than the ones of other two layers.On the contrary,the \u03a3 REE in sample 0346 are quite high in all three layers and decline slightly from the inner to outer layers.The relatively oxidized environment of the seawater during growth of the inner layers might favor formation of ferromanganese oxyhydroxides and absorption of Ce~(4+),resulting in a higher Ce content and \u03a3 REE in the inner layers.On the other hand,phosphatization events caused strong depletion of REE in the crusts.In the growth profile of the crusts,\u03b4Ce increasing and varying more greatly from outer to inner layers,suggesting that the growth environments of these crusts varied from relatively turbulent and oxidized to peaceful and reduced during growth.",

        "abstract": "Axi gold deposit,occurring in the Tulasu volcanic fault-basin in the Paleozoic active-continental-margin on the north side of the Yili-Central Tianshan Plate,is a low-sulfidation type of epithermal gold deposit formed in the Paleozoic era.The host rocks are andesitic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Paleozoic Dahalajun-shan Formation,and the ore bodies occurred as veins in annular faults of an old caldera.Ore-related minerals consist mainly of native gold,electrum,pyrite,marcasite,arsenopyrite,hematite,limonite,and trace amounts of pyrargyrite,naumannite,polybasite,cerargyrite,etc,whereas gangue minerals consist mainly of quartz,chalcedony,sericite,calcite,siderite,adularia,etc.The main wall-rock alterations were silicification, phyllic alteration,carbonatization and propylitization.The deposit is characterized by enrichments of Au,Ag, As,Sb,Bi,Hg,Se,Te and Mo relative to average crust,and low Ag/Au ratios(0.46-11.1).The compositions of hydrogen,oxygen,carbon,sulfur and noble gas isotopes indicate that ore-forming fluids of the Axi gold deposit consisted predominantly of circulating meteoric water.The salinities of ore-forming fluid vary mainly from 0.7 to 3.1 wt%NaCl_(eqv),with an average of 2.2 wt%NaCl_(eqv).The homogenization temperatures are mainly of 120 to 240\u2103,with an average of 190\u2103,the fluid density is 0.73 to 0.95 g/cm~3,and thus the estimated maximum mineralization depth is about 700 m.The boiling of the ore-forming fluid had occurred, leading to the supersaturation of the hydrothermal solution and the deposition of ore metals.This is the main mineralization mechanism for quartz-vein type ores in Axi.The ore-forming fluid was buffered to a near-neutral pH in a reduced environment during mineralization.Geochemical and geological characteristics show that Axi is a typical Paleozoic low-sulfidation type of epithermal gold deposit.The preservation of this Paleozoic Axi deposit required a rapid covering by the sedimental cover of Aqialehe Formation after the formation of the deposit Beginning in the Pliocene,the Tianshan had dominated by rapid thrusting and uplifting as a result of the collision and compression between India and Eurasia,which led to part of the deposit cover being eroded and the deposit reemerged.The discovery of Axi is therefore critical for guiding the exploration of epithermal gold deposits in pre-Mesozoic orogenic belts.",

        "abstract": "Authigenic pyrite is the normal product of anoxic sulfate reduction in marine sediments. Core HD196A, recovered from the seafloor of the northeastern South China Sea, has large amount of pyrites. The morphologies of pyrites are as the form of rod with hollow or not. The intervals around 500 cm of Core HD196A are enriched in authigenic pyrites, showing a rich zone of pyrites. Further studies show that the pyrite-enriched zone is consistent with the content boundaries of organic carbon, sulfate, methane and carbonate, where organic carbon, methane and carbonate increase downward, but sulfate starts to decrease sharply. The pyrite-enriched zone, combined with the content boundaries of organic carbon, methane, sulfate, and carbonate, show a sedimentary or geochemical change of Core 196A. Anaerobic methane oxidation and anoxic sulfate reduction contributed to pyrite formation, respectively. Large amount of pyrites occurrence can be a possible evidence of methane anomaly in marine sediments.",

Comparatively,N-MORB normalized trace elements patterns and chondrite normalized REE patterns of the CCSD quartz veins and Donghai erystals are quite similar to those of their respective host rocks,suggest that most of the quartz veins and the crystals derived from their host metamorphic rocks,and crust fluids released during plate subduction and exhumation might migrated at grain scale.",

        "abstract": "Rare earth elements( REEs) composition and chondrite-normalized REEs patterns of scheelites can be used as an important basis to determine the genesis of deposits. In-situ determination is more conducive to analysis of ore-forming fluid evolution characteristics in terms of single minerals. REEs compositions in scheelite from auriferous quartz veins in Daping gold deposit were analyzed in-situ by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry( ICP- MS) coupled with 193 nm ArF excimer GeoLasPro laser ablation system and are reported in this paper. The results show that analysis of scheelite can yield precise and accurate data for REEs by using NIST 610 as the external standard and Ca as the internal standard. The cathode luminescence images show that the crystal composition of scheelite is relatively homogeneous. The experimental results show that they have very similar MREEs-enriched patterns with chondrite-normalized,which have very high \u03a3REEs( 918. 00- 2094. 97 \u03bcg / g),obvious positive anomaly of \u03b4 Eu( 1. 17- 1. 95),and no anomaly of Ce. However,the content of each element changes within a certain range,which reflects that the REEs distributions are not exactly homogeneous. Comparing the analysis results of in-situ Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry( LA-ICP-MS) and solution nebulization ICP- MS,the accuracy and reliability of the in-situ LA-ICP-MS method is demonstrated for the first time. Based on all the results,routine digestion and ICP-MS analytical method provide the average contents of a bulk sample. By comparison,LA-ICP-MS has the advantages of being a rapid method with high spatial resolution( < 40 \u03bcm) and in-situ analysis,which is more important for scheelites which host an inhomogeneous rare earth elements distribution.",

        "abstract": "Epidotes in Qinglongshan ultrahigh pressure metamorphic eclogites experienced four metamorphic stages; Early epidote-amphibolite facies prograde metamorphic stage (\u2160) , coesite-eclogite facies stage (\u2161) , quartz-eclogite facies stages (\u2162) and late amphobolite facies retrograde metamorphic stage (\u2163). Chemical compositions of the epidotes formed in stage\u2160are characterized by the high Fe2O3contents (14. 796 - 17. 84% ) and XFe(0. 413 -0. 486), and low CaO and Al2O3. Epidotes formed in stage\u2161and\u2162show continuous compositional variation. The core which was mainly formed in stage H is relatively enriched in Fe ( Fe2O3 =11. 933 -12. 993% , XFe = 0. 322 -0. 358) and depleted in CaO and Al2O3, while the rim which was mainly formed in stage\u2162shows relatively low Fe concentration (Fe2O3 =9. 628 - 10. 138% , XFe =0. 275 -0. 286) and high CaO and Al2O3 contents. Epidotes formed in stage\u2163possess similar chemical composition with those of stage\u2160, and are characterized by high Fe2 O3 concentrations and XFe (0.433). Compositional variation of epidotes reflects the rapid subduction and exhumation process of Su-Lu ultrahigh pressure metamorphic belt. Three kind of Fe2+ and Mg2+ bearing aqueous inclusions have been recognized in the epidote: high-salinity (22. 5 to slightly more than 23. 2wt% NaCl) inclusions, moderate to high salinity(12.6 - 16. 0wt% NaCl)and medium salinity (6. 4 - 11. 7wt% NaCl) inclusions, which were formed in stage\u2161,\u2162and\u2163respectively. Studies of fluid inclusions in epidotes confirm that no large scale penetrative fluid flow occurred during the UHP metamorphism, and the metamorphic fluid expelled during exhumation of the Qinglongshan UHP rocks flowed mainly at grain scale.",

        "abstract": "The research of structural water in nominally anhydrous minerals(NAMs)is significant for understand of the fluid flow activity in ultra-high pressure metamorphism,the geodynamics in convergent continental margins and the water recycling in mantle.This study focus on the structural hydroxyl concentrations of rutile in eclogites from main-hole of the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling project (CCSD)and its areas nearby employing microscope Fourier infrared spectroscopy(FTIR)with unpolarized light.The rutile grains all exhibit a single sharp band at near 3285 cm~(-1)or 3295 cm~(-1),which is the structural hydroxyl(OH~-)absorption band,indicating water is structurally incorporated in rutiles. Calculating with the molar absorption coefficient[38000 L/(mol\u00b7cm~2)]of Maldener et al.(2001)shows that the\u201cwater\u201dcontents in rutiles are 324 to 523\u00d710~(-6),which is greatly lower than the previous researcher's result calculated with the molar absorption coefficient[3270 L/(mol\u00b7cm~2)]of Hammer et al., (1991).The inhomogenous distribution of OH~- in rutile is shown not only in different samples but also in the different micro-areas in the same grain,indicating that the fluid flow activity in ultra-high pressure metamorphism is limited and slabe subduction and exhumation are quick.",

Methods Serum leptin and plasma NPY levels were between with RIA in 180 patients with different kinds of tumors and 30 controls. Results \u2460 Leptin levels were statistically higher in patients with gastric cancer (n=38), liver cancer (n=30), esophageal carcinoma (n=38), colon carcinoma (n=32) and lung cancer (n=42) than those in controls (4.18\u00b10.51ng/ml) (P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.01, P<0.05). Plasma NPY levels in controls were (150.25\u00b120.33)pg/ml. NPY levels were significantly higher in the patients (except patients with liver cancer than those in controls). \u2461 Leptin levels were positively correlated with NPY levels in patients with gastric cancer. Esophageal carcinoma and colon carcinoma (r=0.354, 0.30, 0.285, P<0.01). Leptin levels were also positively correlated with TG in patients with gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal carcinoma and colon carcinoma (r=0.301, 0.268, 0.335, P<0.01). There were no correlations between leptin and TC, LDL-C, HDL-C levels. Conclusion \u2460 There were high leptin and NPY blood levels in patients with gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophagesl carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and lung cancer. \u2461Leptin and NPY might play important roles in the development of tumor cachexia through their abnormal synthesis, secretion and receptor binding.",

Methods Expressions of IL-18R\u03b1 on peripheral CD4+ cells were determined with flow-cytometry in 33 patients after renal transplantation dynamically on the day before operation, d7 and d14 as well as once in 30 controls. Results The expressions of IL-18R\u03b1 on CD4+ cells in the patients before operation were significantly higher than those in the controls (P<0.01). Post-operatively, both on d7 and d14, the levels of expression in the six patients with acute rejection were significantly higher than those before operation (P<0.01). However, in the 27 patients without acute rejection, the expression levels were significantly higher than the preoperative levels only on d7 (P<0.01), but dropped to preoperative levels by d14 (P>0.05). Conclusion Th1 type immune-response was dominant in the patients as shown by the pre-operative higher-than-control levels of IL-18R\u03b1 expression. persistent increased expression of IL-18R\u03b1 post-operatively by d14 might indicate the development of rejection.",

Methods HO8910 cells were incubated and divided into three groups: the test groups with 17-\u03b2E2 or progesterone(P) at different concentration(called 17-\u03b2E2 group or P group),and the control group with ethanol for 72 hours,respectively.By using real-time fluorensence quantitive RT-PCR the expression of KLK5 mRNA in the three groups were measured. And the cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethlthiazol-z-yl)-2,5-dipheny tetrazolium blue(MTT) colorimetric assay.Results The expression of KLK5 mRNA in HO8910 cells in 17-\u03b2E2 group was higher than ethanol control group(P<0.01) at a dose-dependent way. While in progesterone group expression level of KLK5 mRNA was decreased(P<0.01).And MTT test showed the cell absorbance value of HO8910 cells in 17-\u03b2E2 group was significantly increased,while decreased in progesterone group. Conclusion Estrogen can up-regulate the expression of KLK5 mRNA and stimulate HO8910 cell proliferation,while progesterone act just oppositely.",

        "abstract": "To analyze the characteristics of complex chromosomal rearrangement (CCR) in Chinese male carriers and its influence on male fertility.Using the G band technique, we conducted karyotype analysis on the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 1,625 Chinese males with reproductive problems. We also searched CNKI and Wanfang database for CCR-related literature published between January 1984 and November 2013, followed by statistical analysis on the CCR characteristics and reproduction-related data of the CCR carriers.Two CCR carriers were found among the 1,625 males and another 47 cases identified from the databases. Among the 49 CCR carriers, there were 17 three-way exchange cases (34.7%), 17 double two-way exchange cases (34.7%), and 15 exceptional cases (30.6%), with no statistically significant differences in the incidence of the three types (P > 0.05). Azoospermia- or oligospermia-induced infertility was found in 19 (38.8% ) of the CCR carriers. A total of 87 pregnancies were achieved in the other 30 (61.2%), among which spontaneous abortion occurred in 75.9% (66/87), dead fetus and malformed infant death in 9.2% (8/87), and phenotypically normal offspring in 14.9% (13/87). Recurrent abortion was associated frequently with breakpoints on CCR-involved chromosomes 6, 7, 8, 11, and 16, while dyszoospermia mostly with breakpoints on CCR-involved chromosomes 10 and 14. The breaking occurred more than 3 times at 1p22, 1q25, 2q31, 5p13, 5q35, 6q23, 8q13, and 20p13. Moreo- ver, the breakpoints at 2q31, 5q35, and 8q13 were particularly related to recurrent abortion, while that at 1p22 only to dyszoospermia.CCR is extremely rare. Male CCR carriers are often identified through reproductive problems and have high risks of infertility and abnormal pregnancy and a very low rate of normal newborns. In addition, chromosomes and breakpoints involved in CCR may affect the fertility of male CCR carriers, and some particular chromosomal breakpoints may play a key role in gametogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of rituximab on purging peripheral blood stem cells and mobilization in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma(NHL). Methods Eight B-cell NHL (stage \u2162/\u2163)patients received the combination mobilization program composed of high-dose cyclophosphamide (HD-CTX), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF) and rituximab (375 mg\u00b7m-2\u00b7d-1, on d-1 and d7) after 4 to 6 courses of induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy (CHOP or CHOP-like) \u00b1 rituximab. Adverse reactions related to rituximab, the period of myelosuppression, complications, the PBSC harvest time and quantity, and the tumor marker genes in harvests were evaluated. Results Only one patient occurred mild erythra in the mobilizing courses. Leukaphereses were started on (11.6\u00b11.0)d after the end of chemotherapy and adequate mononuclear cells (MNC) could be obtained in median of 2(1\uff5e3) times harvest procedures. The mean numbers of MNC and CD+34 cells harvested separately was (3.4\u00b11.0)\u00d7108/kg, (3.6\u00b11.7)\u00d7106/kg. Five patients accomplished auto-peripheral blood stem cells transplantation (APBSCT), IgH/TCR shifted to negative in three patients, and remained negative in one after APBSCT. Four patents were still in disease free survival; one relapsed at 3 months after APBSCT. Conclusion The addition of rituximab did not compromise the collection efficiency in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Rituximab could potentially purge the graft of occult CD+20 tumor cells.",

The expression of hK6 in higher-grade ovarian cancer tissues (68.4% ) was higher than that in low-grade ones (14.3%, P < 0.05). The expression of hK6 in late-stage (stage III, 76.7%) was significantly higher than that in early-stage (stage I or II, 26.7%, P < 0.01). The expression of hK6 was significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastasis (77.8%) than that in patients without (33.3%, P < 0.01). The expression of hK6 in the cancer tissues in the patients died, or with reccurence or metastasis within 3 years after surgery was higher (75.0%) than that in the patients with stable disease (42.9%, P < 0.05).The expression of hK6 in ovarian cancer was higher than that in benign and borderline ovarian neoplasms. The expression of hK6 is higher in the ovarian cancer of late stage, higher-grade, with lymph node metastasis and is associated with a poorer prognosis. hK6 may become a new markers in prediction of prognosis of the patients with ovarian tumors.",

        "abstract": "Numerous spectroradiometric measurements were carried out in the Caofeidian offing and,on such a basis,correlation was made between the average reflectance and the concentrations of surface suspended particulate matter(SPM).The empirical relationships were established between remote-sensing reflectance(Rrs) in TM-HRV bands and SPM concentrations.The results show that the remote-sensing reflectance increases with SPM concentrations.When the SPM concentrations are lower than 20 mg/L,the amplitudes of remote-sensing are wider in the 570 nm than in the 670 nm,but when the SPM concentrations are higher than 20 mg/L,things are just the opposite.The best correlations are obtained for Rrs(TM3) and SPM concentrations,which show remarkable exponential correlations.As a result,SPM concentrations within the surface waters in Caofeidian offing are estimated with an average accuracy better than \u00b128%.",

        "abstract": "The feasibility of building groundwater reservoir in Circum-Bohai-Sea region of China is analyzed from recharge water source, hydrogeology, environmental geology, eco-environmental effects, economic profit and so on. The feasible groundwater reservoir can be compartmentalized into four types: coastal river valley type, intermountain basin(river valley) type, alluvial and flood plain(fan) type and ancient riverbed of alluvial plain type. And the regulating ability of groundwater reservoir and the newly enhanced exploitation quantity of groundwater have been appraised in the paper. As a result of the analysis and appraisement it is revealed that along the coastal area of Liaoning and Shandong there are 35 sites of coastal river valley type suitable to build groundwater reservoirs with total reservoir capacity of 28.85\u00d7108 m3 and newly enhanced groundwater allowable exploitation quantity of 2.60\u00d7108 m3, and in Jiaodong peninsula there are 4 sites of intermountain river valley plain type suitable to build groundwater reservoirs with total reservoir capacity of 1.22\u00d7108 m3 and newly enhanced groundwater allowable exploitation quantity of 0.24\u00d7108 m3. At present, there are 8 places of groundwater reservoir of coastal river valley type that have been built in this region, which have enhanced the allowable exploitation quantity of groundwater of 2.89\u00d7108 m3 and brought notable economical, social and environmental profits. Therefore, it is very important in Circum-Bohai-Sea region for solving shortage of water resource, improving water quality, and preventing seawater invasion to construct groundwater reservoirs in the coastal river valley area.",

Using our country' SupNIR-1000 near infrared spectrometer, the models were set up by artificial neural network (ANN). Related coefficient of calibration (r(c)) of fat model of mince was 0.971 and related coefficient of prediction (r(p)) was 0.972. The protein' r(c) and RP were 0.952 and 0.949, respectively. The moisture' r(c) and r(p) were 0.938 and 0.927, respectively. Using ground beef established models, the fat' r(c) and r(p) were 0.935 and 0.810; the protein' r(c) and r(p) were 0.954 and 0.868; the moisture' r(c) and r(p) were 0.930 and 0.913, respectively. So near infrared reflectance spectroscopy can better detect the fat, protein and moisture of mince than ground beef. But basically the ground beef model also can be used to quickly predict the chemical composition on line.",

The technique of impedance was introduced firstly. The impedance spectroscopy of sandstone was tested at different physical states by CHI600A electrochemical workstation. It was shown that the impedance spectroscopy of rock included four parts. To analyze the Nyquist chart of rock and the data of impedance spectroscopy of porous medium, the variation of AC impedance spectroscopy (ACIS) revealed the variation of the different inner structure of rock. The high frequency part of ACIS was one-stage capacity reactance arc which reflected the volume characteristics of rock, including the size and connection condition of rock inner pore and their uniformity. The parameters of rock microstructure in the high frequency part of ACIS were selected. The relation of the parameters of the high frequency part of ACIS and rock microstructure was established.

Consequently, the nonlinear mechanical phenomena occur with high frequency, which brings about great difficulties for deep engineering support during excavation and mining. These problems caused by the deep mining engineering are the focuses in the fields of mining engineering and rock mechanics. A lot of achievements have been obtained by scholars through theoretical study, experimental test, and in-situ test. The loose and cracked compound roof of working face 2442 in Jiahe Coal Mine is difficult to control by using traditional support measures which increase the walls shrink and the floor heave and greatly affect the normal excavation and safe production. Based on the in-situ investigation, experimental test, analysis of engineering geological conditions, geomechanical evaluation and numerical simulation, the deformation and damage mechanisms of the roadway are analyzed; and then the bolt-mesh-cable coupling support design is put forward. The result of in-situ test shows that the new design can ultimately guarantee the stability of deep coal gateway. The design scheme of bolt-mesh-cable coupling support is feasible and efficient for the stability control of surrounding rock in deep mining engineering.",

The establishing method of four membership functions for concrete engineering index was researched through using the uniaxial compress strength of rock mass as an example during fuzzy classification of rock mass. The membership degree of a uniaxial compress strength value was calculated by the above-mentioned four membership functions. It was found that there was a bigger difference among the membership degrees calculated by different subject functions. Five main indexes that influence rock mass stability were picked out through analysis. Based on data of the surrounding rock of a tunnel, the membership degree values of the uniaxial compress strength of rock mass, RQD, integrality coefficient and soft coefficient were calculated respectively by three membership functions, and the membership degree of structure surface was decided, through a membership degree value table, for the rock mass of roadway. Some difference among the membership degree values of the rock mass of roadway was found when the membership functions that were used to calculate the membership degree were different. Yet the classification result of rock mass is identical under different membership degrees from different membership functions. The researched result testified equivalence, adaptability and correctness of a common membership function in fuzzy. The theoretic base of choice a subject function in fuzzy classification for rock mass was suggested.",

        "abstract": "The asymmetric deformation characteristics of surrounding rock after excavating and supporting of deep roadway within inclined rock strata, its failure mechanism and coupling control countermeasure are investigated by numerical simulations. Some typical applications of engineering cases are also presented. It is indicated that the deformation failure is significantly influenced by a key position of obtuse angle between roadway sections and incline directions of rock strata. Its failure mechanism can be explained by the discrepancy of deformation between interlayer shearing slip and high-stress squeezing, which is induced by the asymmetric structure of rock masses. For reducing the effect of asymmetric deformation, the asymmetric coupling control countermeasure is put forward based on the research result, which means that the key position of surrounding rock that may produce deformation discrepancy should be reinforced by anchor cable and floor bolt after bolt-net- anchor coupling support. Through numerical simulations and engineering applications, it is demonstrated that the strategy of asymmetric coupling support can definitely decrease the discrepancy deformation at the key position of surrounding rock and effectively enhance the stability of roadway surrounding rock masses.",

        "abstract": "In order to overcome the roof support problems associated with deep high-stressed soft rock roadway at level 3 in Hebi No. 5 Coal Mine, the deformation failure mechanism and its support countermeasure are investigated using theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The result shows that the main reasons of deformation failures in deep roadways are 1) highly relying on the piling up of several support styles, and 2) ignoring the coupling between support and surrounding rock or the couplings among different supports. This is because massive deformation energy is accumulated in surrounding rock, which is induced by high stress and soft rock dilatability. In responding to the problems identified, a countermeasure of bolt-mesh-anchor-shotcrete + floor-bolt + truss coupling supporting is proposed, namely using shotcrete to seal surrounding rock, bolt-mesh support to release deformation energy, floor bolt to transfer floor heave plastic slippage force, anchor-truss support to control the deformation of surrounding rock. Therefore, the effective deformation control of deep high stressed soft rock roadway can be achieved. The method proposed was applied at Hebi No. 5 mine and proved to be successful.",

        "abstract": "By integrating the quadratic regression analysis of orthogonal composite design and the statistical significance testing, a discriminant method to describe the effect degree of various factors on structural eigenvalue is established. By introducing such a method into the reliability analysis process of response surface for the stability of the surrounding rock of tunnels, an optimum approach for identifying the degree of importance with respect to basic ingredients for state function is developed, which can eliminate the drawback of being incapable of assessing the importance degree of basic ingredients on the structural state when establishing a series of response surfaces for the state function. A MATLAB-based search technology is utilized to solve the reliability index of the improved response surface by means of the optimum approach developed for the state function, which figures out the problem of result distortion. On the basis of the integration between both the above methods, a response surface analysis technique with relatively high computational efficiency is then proposed for the reliability evaluation of the surrounding rock of tunnels in complicated stratum. The proposed technique is illustrated by a certain practical example, in which the running process and operating procedure are demonstrated, and then several aspects related to this technique such as the computational efficiency and accuracy of the results are also verified, showing its validity and applicability.",

The adaptive PM (APM), by adaptively segmenting a signal, improves PM\u2019s performance, but it takes fixed step to search the subsegments\u2019 dividing points, so efficiency is low and execution time is long. This paper proposes a modified APM (MAPM) that introduces variable-step measure and greatly promotes the searching efficiency. Simulation results show that MAPM\u2019s signal fitting and parameters estimation are of high accuracy, and the signal interpolation and prolongation based on it are adaptive while the traditional methods are not.

By introducing the concepts of the biased on-time and time- voltage transfer coefficient, a modified model (MM) is proposed to realize the linear transition from the duration ratio to the output voltage and break the frequency limitation of the approximate models due to linearization. A quasi-PID controller that can eliminate the inherent tracking error is assigned to control the MM. To inhibit the parameters drifting impacts on the controller, a neuron adaptive quasi-PID controller based on the perceptron supervised Hebb learning rule is proposed, ameliorating the control performance excellently and making the strategy fulfill the accuracy requirements of fault waveform reconstruction; and the algorithm's computational burden is so low that it is suitable for real time implementation and software update. \u00a9 2009 Chin.

Methods A S. aureus biomembrane was prepared by a polymer filtration technique and then lemon extract was added at 1 h,2 h,and 3 h respectively. The number of surviving bacterium with a different biomembrane was calculated via bacterial colony count;changes in bacterial protein as a result of the lemon extract were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The DNA extracted from S. aureus was cut by EcoR\u2160 and changes in the cleavage map were evaluated. The effects of lemon extract on the bacterial cell wall were observed at low osmotic pressures of 5,10,and 15 min. Bactericidal action of the lemon extract was analyzed with total RNA and then RNA band intensity in agarose gel was compared to treatment without the lemon extract. Results Results demonstrated that the lemon extract had bactericidal action on the microbes inside biomembrane,and this bactericidal action increased gradually with prolonged incubation time (1.6\u00d7107cfu\u00b7ml-1 ,2.5\u00d7106 cfu\u00b7ml-1 and 5.6\u00d7104 cfu\u00b7ml-1 respectively). The lemon extract had a specific effect on the composition of bacterial protein and its expression and the cleavage map of bacterial DNA cut by EcoR\u2160 was altered. The action of the lemon extract (15 min incubation) produced defects in the bacterial cell wall,namely bacterial swelling in a large spherical shape. Viruses were eliminated by the action of the lemon extract. Conclusion Results indicated that lemon extract may change certain key structures of bacteria or inhibit bacteria by destroying the bacterial cell wall,and the mechanisms of these changes require further study.",

The wet expansion of PI film as wet strain on the FBG results in the shift of Bragg wavelength. The sensor realizes the relative humidity monitoring of 26%RH-98%RH. The method achieves FBG humidity sensor's better performance by improving the preparation and coating process of PI film and also compensates the temperature. On this basis, the distributed optical fiber Bragg humidity sensor system is prposed for the requirement of multi-point humidity monitoring. The experiments prove that the method can effectively improve the sensor performance, the humidity sensitivity of the sensor is 15 pm/% RH and the linearity error is less than 2.75%.

A kind of photoelectric composite film with unique performance is constituted by coating optical transparent films with different thicknesses and properties between the gold film and the fiber core, as internal modulation layer. It can adjust both the evanescent wave vector and gold film surface plasma oscillation wave vector, and then control resonance effect to provide a basis for sensitivity adjustment. Numerical simulation is done on the attribute of built-in modulation layer structure optical fiber SPR resonance incentive model using the finite difference time domain method. On this basis, a built-in modulation layer type optical fiber SPR sensor probe is developed for liquid refractive index measurement. The experiment results show that as the refractive index increases, the SPR resonance spectrum shifts to the long wave direction, in refractive index range from 1.335 to 1.392. The sensitivity can reach to 2263.1 nm/RIU, which is two times of conventional optical fiber SPR sensor based on the fiber core-gold film-environment medium three layer structure. All show that this new sensor can meet the needs of the environment index test much better.",

        "abstract": "Currently, China has been experiencing rapid growth of medical costs, serious waste of medical resources, increasing disease burden for residents, and a medical insurance fund deficit. Therefore, an urgent problem that needs to be solved is to choose a rational payment for the insurance system. To empirically evaluate the long-term effects of capitation reform in a New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme in Pudong New Area, we collected and analysed data regarding financing, fund operation, medical service cost, and medical care-seeking behaviour from 2011 to 2015, a duration that includes data before and after reform. The data for financing and behaviours were compared year by year, and the monthly data for inpatient and outpatient costs were evaluated in a retrospective time series study. The capitation reform in Pudong New Area showed strong evidence of the power of medical cost control in the long run, while it was weak in reversing the number of patients flowing into secondary and tertiary hospitals. To make the payment of capitation play a bigger role in cost control in China, a tighter alignment of capitation with the general practitioner system and achieving dual referral is critical for future studies.",

        "abstract": "To tackle the shortage of health personnel in the rural areas of Pudong New Area of Shanghai, the local government issued an incentive policy as one of the medical reforms. The current investigation focused on the relevant incentive measures and their corresponding effects and problems with a view to providing referential and useful experiences for those who are engaged in addressing the same problem at home and abroad. The details of the incentive policy were derived from the government document, and the related data about the flow of the rural community health care providers, from the institutional investigation. As indicated by the current investigation, the incentive policy produced some positive effect in attracting health care providers to work in the rural community health centers, especially general practitioners, nurses, MS/MD degree holders, and intermediate professional title holders to be employed in the farther ones. However, it was turned out that the population of high quality health care providers was still not sufficient enough to cover the whole rural areas, which suggested that it was still hard to draw such qualified medical individuals. To conclude in the current investigation, we made three recommendations for the policymakers to take into account in terms of policy maintenance, benefits for health personnel, and guarantee of their lawful rights and interests.",

        "abstract": "Abstract  Background  The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) covers 900 million farmers (about 95%) in China, but its fund is at serious risk of deficit. Shanghai, one of the developed cities in China, has developed its Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme and NRCMS as an advanced and exemplary representative of Chinese rural health insurance. The participating rate of NRCMS was 99\u00b790% in Pudong New Area in 2015, which meant 277\u2008310 farmers were involved, accounting for 29% of Shanghaiu0027s participants. Pudong New Area of Shanghai implemented NRCMS capitation reform in August, 2012, aimed at controlling the increasing medical costs for farmers and avoid risk to the NRCMSu0027s fund. We aimed to assess long-term effect of the reform.  Methods  We performed a retrospective time series analysis of the NRCMS fund by examining data acquired from Jan 1, 2011, until Dec 31, 2015 (60 months), in Pudong. The analysis was based on time series data modelling before Aug 1, 2012, and we compared forecast data produced with Wintersu0027 additive models and with simple seasonal models with observed data for the 40 months after capitation reform. Outcome measurements included numbers and costs of insured outpatients and inpatients.  Findings  The mean forecasted outpatient cost per visit (\u00a5102\u00b700, mean absolute percentage error [MAPE] 2\u00b79%) and inpatient cost (\u00a512\u2008836\u00b763, 1\u00b79%) by Wintersu0027 additive models were both higher than observed values (outpatient cost \u00a590\u00b737, p vs  actual visits 486\u2008976, p=0\u00b7121; predicted inpatient visits 2173  vs  actual visits 2147, p=0\u00b774). NRCMS fund surplus rate was 8\u00b784% in 2015, which was 6\u00b793 percentage points higher than it was in 2011.  Interpretation  Capitation reform led to declines in per outpatient and inpatient costs, while the medical need remained unchanged. Furthermore, the increased surplus rate ensured the fundu0027s security.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  To help drive the consolidation and integrated management of basic medical insurance in China, we analysed participantsu0027 satisfaction, and factors associated with satisfaction, for the Urban Employeesu0027 Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), Urban Residentsu0027 Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI), and New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS).    Methods  Pudong New Area in Shanghai was chosen as a typical sample of basic medical insurance coverage and management. 3395 residents (1200 households) were selected in September, 2013, by stratified cluster sampling and participants were interviewed face-to-face by trained investigators. Factors associated with satisfaction were analysed by ordinal logistic regression. Ethics approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Pudong Institute for Health Development.    Findings  URBMI participants reported a higher rate of dissatisfaction in outpatient (n=7, 5\u00b710%), inpatient (7, 12\u00b750%), and overall (127, 12\u00b785%) experience. NRCMS had the highest rate of outpatient satisfaction (65, 84\u00b74%), with no participants reporting dissatisfaction. UEBMI had the highest rate of inpatient satisfaction (96, 70\u00b71%). Affordability of out-of-pocket cost, proportion of reimbursement, and time of insurance reimbursement were positively correlated with satisfaction for UEBMI; awareness of premium and compensation policy, affordability of out-of-pocket cost, proportion of reimbursement, and procedure of reimbursement were associated with greater satisfaction with URBMI, whereas participants with lower education were more satisfied. Factors associated with satisfaction with NRCMS were the same as for URBMI, with the exception of education level, and the addition of affordability of premium and time of reimbursement, which were positively correlated.    Interpretation  The Chinese government should take effective measures, such as taking advantage of the family doctor system, to regulate and reinstitute sequential medical order (referral from primary medical institutions to high level medical institutions), which could lead to short-term implications of satisfaction but will lead to both satisfaction and rational medical order in the long term. The fairness of financing and reimbursing across different basic medical insurance policies (in terms of reasonable costs to patients) needs to be improved.

        "title": "Effectiveness of an incentive policy intervention for rural health-care providers: a longitudinal survey in Shanghai",
        "abstract": "Abstract  Background  Grassroots health-care institutions in China are facing a shortage of professionals, especially general practitioners. To encourage health-care providers to come to and stay at rural grassroots institutions, Pudong New Area of Shanghai undertook a series of incentive reforms for rural health-care providers in July, 2014. We evaluated the effectiveness of incentive reform.  Methods  The reform covered Pudongu0027s 32 rural community health centres (CHCs): 12 remote rural CHCs, 11 general rural CHCs, and 9 suburban CHCs. The 13 urban CHCs in Pudong were not covered. The scheme included general practitioners, public health physicians, and other medical personnel. Motivators included eight aspects, such as bonus, promotion, and housing, of which bonus was the most important. Health-care providers in rural areas could get a monthly bonus of \u00a51000\u20136000; general practitioners in remote rural CHCs received \u00a56000. Quantity and statuses of community health-care providers for 2013\u20132015 were collected from 45 CHCs in the form of an institutional survey. Ethics approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Pudong Institute for Health Development.  Findings  From December 31, 2013, to December 31, 2015, the total number of general practitioners in rural and suburban CHCs increased by 12\u00b74%, from 799 to 898. The inflow of general practitioners increased by three times in remote rural CHCs (from 1 to 4), 1\u00b72 times in general rural CHCs (from 6 to 13), and 0\u00b76 times in suburban CHCs (from 14 to 22), and decreased by 52\u00b75% (from 61 to 29) in urban CHCs. In 2015, the proportion of general practitioners as a share of health personnel was 19\u00b78% (898 of 4528) in rural and suburban areas, an increase of 2\u00b78 percentage points compared with 2013. The turnover rate of rural health-care providers decreased from 6\u00b73% to 3\u00b78% in these areas and from 11\u00b78% to 6\u00b75% in urban areas.  Interpretation  With the financial incentives intervention, rural and suburban CHCs were more attractive to health-care providers, especially general practitioners. Furthermore, the stability of health-care providers was improved, especially in remote rural areas. However, the sustainability of financial subsidies and the policy depression effect, which means that there might be more inflow of health-care providers from other remote areas to Pudong and this will exacerbate the shortages of health personnel in and outside Shanghai, should be of concern in the long term.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  The so-called health brain-drain\u2014which refers to the health workers leaving their present jobs to other institutions, especially in rural areas\u2014severely restricts the development of primary healthcare. To solve the problem, Pudong New Area of Shanghai carried out a series of incentive policies such as salary bonus, promotion and housing from July, 2014. In our study we aimed to analyse the change in health brain-drain which resulted from this policy.    Methods  There are 45 community health centres in Pudong, which we classified into 4 categories by geographical division: remote rural, general rural, suburban, and urban. The policy only applied to the 32 community health centres classified as remote rural, general rural, and suburban. Healthcare personnel in these community health centres were given a monthly bonus of \u00a51000\u20136000. We did an institutional survey about the quantity and structure of the overall and outflowed health personnel in all 45 community health centres from December 31, 2013, to December 31, 2015. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Pudong Institute for Health Development and was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.    Findings  The overall rate of health brain-drain decreased from 8\u00b71% (568/6996) in 2013 to 4\u00b76% (302/6553) in 2015. The rate in community health centres in remote rural, general rural, and suburban areas decreased from 6\u00b73% (298/4699) to 3\u00b78% (170/4528), and from 11\u00b78% (270/2297) to 6\u00b75% (132/2025) in community health centres in urban areas. In community health centres in remote rural, general rural, and suburban areas, the rate of decline in general practitioners, public health physicians and clinicians, and nurses in decreased by 0\u00b75 (from 1\u00b775% to 1\u00b722%), 2\u00b70 (from 9\u00b731% to 7\u00b727%) and 4\u00b76 (from 8\u00b723% to 3\u00b767%) percentage points, respectively, in 2015 compared with 2013. Moreover, in areas where highest bonuses were offered (remote rural), rates of decline were smaller than in areas where no bonuses were offered (urban): 0\u00b70%  versus  2\u00b78% for general practitioners, 5\u00b76%  versus  9\u00b77% for public health physicians and clinicians, and 2\u00b76%  versus  6\u00b78% for nurses.    Interpretation  External economic incentives have relieved the health brain-drain in rural areas and the stability of general practitioners and nurses in remote rural areas has been strengthened. However, there was still unfavorable health brain-drain of public health physicians and clinicians in rural areas. Thus, the policy sustainability and health brain-drain of public health physicians should remain a concern.

        "abstract": "The Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (RCMS) had played an important role in guaranteeing the acquisition of basic medical healthcare of China's rural populations, being an innovative model of the medical insurance system for so many years here in China. Following the boom and bust of RCMS, the central government rebuilt the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) in 2003 across the whole country. Shanghai, one of the developed cities in China, has developed its RCMS and NRCMS as an advanced and exemplary representative of Chinese rural health insurance. But in the past 10\u2009years, its NRCMS has encountered such challenges as a spiral of medical expenditures and a decrease of insurance participants. Previous investigations showed that the capitation and general practitioner (GP) system had great effect on medical cost containment. Thus, the capitation reform combined with GP system reform of NRCMS, based on a system design, was implemented in Pudong New Area of Shanghai as of 1 August 2012. The aim of the current investigation was to present how the reform was designed and implemented, evaluating its effect by analyzing the data acquired from 12\u2009months before and after the reform. This was an empirical study; we made a conceptual design of the reform to be implemented in Pudong New Area. Most data were derived from the institution-based surveys and supplemented by a questionnaire survey, qualitative interviews and policy document analysis. We found that most respondents held an optimistic attitude towards the reform. We employed a structure-process-outcome evaluation index system to evaluate the effect of the reform, finding that the growth rate of the insured population's total medical costs and NRCMS funds slowed down significantly after the reform; that the total medical expenditure of the insured rural population decreased by 3.60%; and that the total expenditure of NRCMS decreased by 3.99%. The capitation was found to help the medical staff build active cost control consciousness. Approximately 2.3% of the outpatients flowed to the primary hospitals from the secondary hospitals; and farmers' annual medical burden was relieved to a certain degree. Meanwhile, it did not affect farmers' utilization and benefits of healthcare. However, further reform still faces new challenges: The capitation reform should be well combined with the primary healthcare system to realize the \"dual gatekeeper\" of GPs; a variety of payment methods should be mixed on the basis of capitation to avoid possible mistakes by one single approach; and the supervision of medical institutions should be strengthened. A long-term follow-up study need to be carried out to evaluate the effects of the capitation reform so as to improve the design of the program. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ",

The general practitioners (GPs)-supported NCD control model was designed to address ways to effectively prevent and control NCDs population-wide. This study aimed to evaluate the GPs-supported NCD control model and its effect on China's NCD control. The model was structured with three layers of two-way relationships between patients, GPs, and specialists. The four technologies included the community-based NCD self-management model, the electronic clinical-pathways-supporting community NCD intervention, the largest regional independent medical information system engaged by the Shanghai Healthcare Cloud, and continuous and successive policy intervention. Under the influence of the model, hypertension awareness, treatment, and control were the highest in Shanghai. By 31 August 2017, 131 453 users declined to use the mobile application while 10 444 completed the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk assessment. By 15 August 2017, 249 000 residents had participated in early detection and screening, leading to the identification of 29 304 (11.8%) being in a prediabetic state and 24 422 (9.8%) being newly diagnosed with T2DM. From 2012 to 2016, 208 537 patients were newly identified with hypertension using Internet-connected devices and hypertension awareness increased 5.7%. After implementing the self-management interventions, patients' blood pressure was controlled at around 90% (from 2007 to 2015). This pilot model in Shanghai suggested positive social benefits and appears to have played an important role in advancing NCD control in China.",

The weathering process makes the originally tight igneous rocks become good quality reservoirs, and fractures play an important role in connecting different types of pores and acts as reservoir space. Isolated and ineffective pores become effective ones due to connection among fractures. Only volcanic breccia can be good-quality reservoirs without any weathering function.

        "abstract": "The volcanic activity is very intense in Qikou sag since the Paleogene, so the volcanic rock is developed in the sag, which are mainly in shallow intrusions of diabase and other means output. According to the use of petrography, fluid inclusion and organic geochemical techniques, we mainly discussed evidences of thermal fluid activities and influence mechanisms of its impact on the reservoir properties. The Paleogene volcanic rocks of Qikou sag is mainly a set of basalt - diabase series of basic volcanic and intrusive rocks. The lithologic characteristics association of contact parts between basalt and clastic rocks are mainly five types: basalt + mudstone, basalt + sand-mudstone interbad, basalt + slate; basalt + shale + sandstone+ mudstone; basalt + sandstone. While diabase have six types: diabase + sandy mudstone, diabase + sandstone(up), diabase + oil shale, diabase + sandstone(down), diabase + mudstone, diabase + sandstone + shale. Evidences of thermal fluid are mainly reflected in hydrothermal alteration of the grains; abnormal increased of vitrinite reflectance; abnormal increased of Tmax-S1-S2; homogrnization temperature abnormal increase; abnormal changed in clay minerals five areas. Whether the shallow basic magmatic activitives (<3500 m) or deep thermal activitives (> 3500 m) from the upper mantle which is rich in CO2 fluid both have significantly improved the properties of the reservoir, but their impact depth have a great difference. Influential extent of shallow mafic magmatic hydrothermal fluid activities is relatively narrow. This is related to the thickness, the temperature of in place and cooling rate of intrusions. The influential extent is about five times thickness of intrusions themselves. Deep CO2-rich thermal fluids have better connectivity and continuity, therefore they have the longer activities and wider influential extent, which are the major factors of thermal fluid activities in the region.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Similar reservoir sandbodies and fault conduit systems in the sandstone reservoirs in the middle Es3 member of the Niuzhuang Sag have been problematic for a long time. The following problems remain unsolved: 1) The distribution of sandstone porosity is inconsistent with the hydrocarbon accumulation. The oil sandstones have low porosity instead of high porosity. 2) Sandstones, which have the same properties, have different levels of oiliness, and the sandstones with almost the same properties show different degrees of oil-bearing capacity. This study analyzes the condition of reservoirs in the research area during the accumulation period in terms of paleoporosity estimation and discusses the critical porosity of the sandstone reservoirs during the same period. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results. 1) Although reservoir properties are low at present and some reservoirs have become tight, the paleoporosity ranging from 18% to 25% is greater than the critical porosity of 13.9%. As the loss of porosity is different in terms of burial history, the present porosity cannot reflect porosity during the accumulation period. Similarly, high porosity during the accumulation period does not indicate that the present porosity is high. 2) The present reservoir location is consistent with the distribution of high paleoporosity during the accumulation period. This result indicates that high porosity belts are prone to hydrocarbon accumulation because of the dominant migration pathways generated as a result of property discrepancies under similar fault conduit conditions. Consequently, the hydrocarbon mainly accumulates in high porosity belts. Paleoporosity during the accumulation period is found to be a vital controlling factor. Therefore, high paleoporosity sandstones in the middle Es3 member of the Niuzhuang Sag have great potential for future exploration.",

        "abstract": "Due to the strong reflection property of materials with smooth surfaces like ceramic and metal, it will cause saturation and the highlight phenomenon in the image when taking pictures of those materials. In order to solve this problem, a new algorithm which is based on reflection component separation (RCS) and priority region filling theory is designed. Firstly, the specular pixels in the image are found by comparing the pixel parameters. Then, the reflection components are separated and processed. However, for ceramic, metal and other objects with strong specular highlight, RCS theory will change color information of highlight pixels due to larger specular reflection component. In this situation, priority region filling theory was used to restore the color information. Finally, we implement 3D experiments on objects with strong reflecting surfaces like ceramic plate, ceramic bottle, marble pot and yellow plate. Experimental results show that, with the proposed method, the highlight caused by the strong reflecting surface can be well suppressed. The highlight pixel number of ceramic plate, ceramic bottle, marble pot and yellow plate, is decreased by 43.8 times, 41.4 times, 33.0 times, and 10.1 times. Three-dimensional reconstruction results show that highlight areas were significantly reduced.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Combination of Gray code and phase-shifting is the most practical and advanced approach for the structured light 3-D measurement so far, which is able to measure objects with complex and discontinuous surface. However, for the traditional combination of the Gray code and phase-shifting, the captured Gray code images are not always sharp cut-off in the black-white conversion boundaries, which may lead to wrong decoding analog code orders. Moreover, during the actual measurement, there also exists local decoding error for the wrapped analog code obtained with the phase-shifting approach. Therefore, for the traditional approach, the wrong analog code orders and the local decoding errors will consequently introduce the errors which are equivalent to a fringe period when the analog code is unwrapped. In order to avoid one-fringe period errors, we propose an approach which combines Gray code with phase-shifting according to unequal period. With theoretical analysis, we build the measurement model of the proposed approach, determine the applicable condition and optimize the Gray code encoding period and phase-shifting fringe period. The experimental results verify that the proposed approach can offer a reliable unwrapped analog code, which can be used in 3-D shape measurement.",

Therefore, this paper presents a reliable absolute analog code retrieval approach. The combination of unequal-period Gray code and phase shifting patterns at high frequencies are used to obtain high-frequency absolute analog code, and at low frequencies, the same unequal-period combination patterns are used to obtain the low-frequency absolute analog code. Next, the difference between the two absolute analog codes was employed to eliminate period jump errors, and a reliable unwrapped result can be obtained. Error analysis was used to determine the applicable conditions, and this approach was verified through theoretical analysis. The proposed approach was further verified experimentally. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can perform reliable analog code unwrapping.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The combined Gray code and phase-shifting approach is a commonly used 3D measurement technique. In this technique, an error that equals integer multiples of the phase-shifted fringe period, i.e. period jump error, often exists in the absolute analog code, which can lead to gross measurement errors. To overcome this problem, the present paper proposes 3D measurement using a combined Gray code and dual-frequency phase-shifting approach. Based on 3D measurement using the combined Gray code and phase-shifting approach, one set of low-frequency phase-shifted fringe patterns with an odd-numbered multiple of the original phase-shifted fringe period is added. Thus, the absolute analog code measured value can be obtained by the combined Gray code and phase-shifting approach, and the low-frequency absolute analog code measured value can also be obtained by adding low-frequency phase-shifted fringe patterns. Then, the corrected absolute analog code measured value can be obtained by correcting the former by the latter, and the period jump errors can be eliminated, resulting in reliable analog code unwrapping. For the proposed approach, we established its measurement model, analyzed its measurement principle, expounded the mechanism of eliminating period jump errors by error analysis, and determined its applicable conditions. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively eliminate period jump errors, reliably perform analog code unwrapping, and improve the measurement accuracy.",

However, for general images where the foreground is the object to be recognized while the background is cluttered, the performance of the current SVT framework is restricted. In this paper, a new image retrieval framework that incorporates a robust distance metric and information fusion is proposed, which improves the retrieval performance relative to the baseline SVT approach. First, the visual words that represent the background are diminished by using a robust Hausdorff distance between different images. Second, image matching results based on three image signature representations are fused, which enhances the retrieval precision. We conducted intensive experiments on small-scale to large-scale image datasets: Corel-9, Corel-48, and PKU-198, where the proposed Hausdorff metric and information fusion outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by about 13, 15, and 15%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is a widely cultivated fruit crop whose growth and productivity are largely affected by low temperatures. On the other hand, wild Vitis species represent valuable genetic resources of natural stress tolerance. We have isolated and characterized a MYB-like gene encoding a putative GARP-type transcription factor from Amur grape (V. amurensis) designated as VaAQUILO. AQUILO (AQ) is induced by cold in both V. amurensis and V. vinifera and its overexpression results in significantly improved tolerance to cold both in transgenic Arabidopsis and Amur grape calli. In Arabidopsis, the ectopic expression of VaAQ increased antioxidant enzyme activities and up-regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging-related genes. Comparative mRNA-Seq profiling of 35S:VaAQ Arabidopsis plants suggests that this transcription factor is related to phosphate homeostasis as per their Arabidopsis closest homologs: AtHRS1 and AtHHO2. However, when a cold stress is imposed, AQ is tightly associated to the cold-responsive pathway and to the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), as observed in the up-regulation of galactinol synthase (GoLS) and raffinose synthase genes. Gene co-expression network (GCN) and cis regulatory element (CRE) analyses in grapevine pointed out AQ as potentially regulating VvGoLS genes. Increased RFOs content was confirmed both in transgenic Arabidopsis and Amur grape calli overexpressing VaAQ. Taken together, our results imply that AQ improves cold tolerance through promoting the accumulation of osmoprotectants.",

        "abstract": "Overexpression of VaWRKY14 increases drought tolerance in Arabidopsis by modulating the expression of stress-related genes, including COR15A, COR15B, COR413, KIN2, and RD29A. The WRKY family is one of a largest transcription factors in plants, and it is a key component of multiple stress responses. In this study, the drought- and cold-induced WRKY family gene VaWRKY14 was isolated and characterized. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VaWRKY14 belongs to the WRKY IIa subfamily, of which several members participate in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Fluorescence observation from Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts transformed with the VaWRKY14::eGFP fusion vector suggested that VaWRKY14 was localized in the nucleus. The VaWRKY14 in yeast cells did not display any transcriptional activity. The expression of VaWRKY14 could be induced by exogenous phytohormones, including salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Overexpression of VaWRKY14 enhanced the drought tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis. Compared with wild-type Arabidopsis, the VaWRKY14-OE lines exhibited higher water content and antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves after drought treatment. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that several stress-related genes, including COR15A, COR15B, COR413, KIN2, and RD29A, were upregulated in transgenic plants relative to their expression in wild-type Arabidopsis under normal conditions. Several genes (3 upregulated and 49 down-regulated) modulated by VaWRKY14 were also affected by drought stress in wild-type plants. These data suggest that VaWRKY14 responds to drought and cold stresses and that drought tolerance may be enhanced by regulating the expression of stress-related genes in Arabidopsis.",

        "abstract": "Overexpression of VaWRKY12, whose nuclear translocation increased under low temperature, enhanced the cold tolerance of Arabidopsis and grapevine calli and significantly increased the expression of antioxidant-related genes. Low temperature causes injuries to buds during winter and to young shoots during early spring, thereby affecting grapevine quality and yield. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of cold stress responses is essential for the breeding of new grapevine cultivars with excellent cold tolerance. Previous studies indicated that WRKY family genes are induced by low temperature in grapevine, but their function in cold stress responses was not clear. Here, a cold-induced WRKY gene, named VaWRKY12, was cloned from Vitis amurensis, which displays remarkable cold tolerance. An atypical transmembrane (TM) region was found in its C-terminal region. Transient expression assays showed that VaWRKY12 was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm at normal temperature but only in the nucleus after cold treatment. By contrast, a truncated version of VaWRKY12 without the TM region was found specifically in the nucleus at normal temperature, and its binding activity to tandem W-box elements in yeast was stronger than that of VaWRKY12, indicating that the TM region might affect the location and function of VaWRKY12. Overexpression of VaWRKY12 enhanced the cold tolerance of transformed Arabidopsis and grapevine calli. Transcriptome data revealed that the expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, including peroxidases and glutathione S-transferases, was upregulated after cold treatment in VaWRKY12-overexpressing grapevine calli compared to the control calli. This study identifies candidate target genes as a basis for further studies on the roles of VaWRKY12 in cold stress responses in grapevine.",

        "abstract": "Cold stress is a major limiting factor in grape (Vitis) productivity. In this study, we characterized a cold-responsive ERF (ethylene response factor) transcription factor, VaERF092, from Amur grape (Vitis amurensis). VaERF092 expression was induced by both low temperatures and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), but was suppressed by treatment with the ethylene inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) under cold conditions. Ectopic expression of VaERF092 in Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced cold tolerance. Co-expression network analysis of V. vinifera genes indicated that WRKY33 might be a downstream target of VaERF092. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that VaWRKY33 was expressed temporally after VaERF092 expression and could also be induced by cold and ACC, and inhibited by AVG. Yeast one-hybrid, transient \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) and dual luciferase reporter assays provided evidence for an interaction between VaERF092 and a GCC-box element in the VaWRKY33 promoter. In addition, heterologous overexpression of VaWRKY33 in A. thaliana resulted in enhanced cold tolerance. VaERF092- and VaWRKY33 overexpressing grape calli showed lower low temperature exothermic values than the empty vector (EV) calli, indicating enhanced tolerance to cold. Together, these results indicate that VaERF092 regulates VaWRKY33 through binding to its promoter GCC-box, leading to enhanced cold stress tolerance. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Vitis amurensis is a wild Vitis plant that can withstand extreme cold temperatures. However, the accumulation of metabolites during cold acclimation (CA) in V. amurensis remains largely unknown. In this study, plantlets of V. amurensis and V. vinifera cv. Muscat of Hamburg were treated at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 24 and 72\u2009h, and changes of metabolites in leaves were detected by gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Most of the identified metabolites, including carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids, accumulated in the two types of grape after CA. Galactinol, raffinose, fructose, mannose, glycine, and ascorbate were continuously induced by cold in V. amurensis, but not in Muscat of Hamburg. Twelve metabolites, including isoleucine, valine, proline, 2-oxoglutarate, and putrescine, increased in V. amurensis during CA. More galactinol, ascorbate, 2-oxoglutarate, and putrescine, accumulated in V. amurensis, but not in Muscat of Hamburg, during CA, which may be responsible for the excellent cold tolerance in V. amurensis. The expression levels of the genes encoding \u03b2-amylase (BAMY), galactinol synthase (GolS), and raffinose synthase (RafS) were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The expression BAMY (VIT_02s0012 g00170) and RafS (VIT_05s0077 g00840) were primarily responsible for the accumulation of maltose and raffinose, respectively. The accumulation of galactinol was attributed to different members of GolS in the two grapes. In conclusion, these results show the inherent differences in metabolites between V. amurensis and V. vinifera under CA.",

        "abstract": "Low temperature is one of the most important environmental factors that limits the geographical distribution and productivity of grapevine. However, the molecular mechanisms on how grapevine responds to cold stress remains to be elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play an essential role during plant development and stress responses. Although miRNAs and their targets have been identified in several Vitis species, their participation during cold accumulation in grapevine remains unknown. In this study, two small RNA libraries were generated from micropropagated 'Muscat Hamburg' (V. vinifera) plantlets under normal and low temperatures (4\u00b0C). A total of 163 known miRNAs and 67 putative novel miRNAs were detected from two small RNA libraries by Solexa sequencing. Forty-four cold-inducible miRNAs were identified through differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) analysis; among which, 13 belonged to upregulated DEMs while 31 belonged downregulated DEMs. The expression patterns of the 13 DEMs were verified by real-time RT-PCR analysis. The prediction of the target genes for DEMs indicated that miRNA may regulate transcription factors, including AP2, SBP, MYB, bHLH, GRAS, and bZIP under cold stress. The 5'-RLM RACE were conducted to verify the cleavage site of predicted targets. Seven predicted target genes for four known and three novel vvi-miRNAs showed specific cleavage sites corresponding to their miRNA complementary sequences. The expression pattern of these seven target genes revealed negative correlation with the expression level of the corresponding vvi-miRNAs. Our results indicated that a diverse set of miRNAs in V. vinifera are cold-inducible and may play an important role in cold stress response. ",

        "abstract": "The FVE gene is considered a classical flowering time locus and affects flowering through the autonomous pathway. In this study, a FVE homologue gene was isolated from Doritaenopsis \u2018Tinny Tender\u2019 (Doritaenopsis Happy smile\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Happy valentine) and designated as DhFVE. The full-length DhFVE cDNA was 1,856\u00a0bp with a 1,407\u00a0bp open reading frame and it encodes 468 amino acids. The putative DhFVE protein contained three conserved regions, one CAF1C_H4-bd region and two WD40 regions. Amino acid sequence alignment showed that DhFVE shares high similarity with FVE homologues from other species. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that DhFVE is ubiquitously expressed in vegetative and reproductive organs. Its transcripts reached higher levels in the vegetative organs (roots, stems, and leaves) during the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, whereas the stems showed the strongest expression. DhFVE was overexpressed in Arabidopsis and flowering of these transgenic plants were more delayed than in wild-type Arabidopsis by 2\u20133\u00a0days. The results indicate that DhFVE may play an important role in the regulation of flowering.",

Originally considered to be aqueous deposits, we reinterpret these strata as representing an extensive aeolian system in a desert environment. This paper suggests that the development of aeolian deposits in the Tangbian Fm. represents the culmination of the Late-Cretaceous desertification that followed the relatively humid early Late-Cretaceous epoch in the interior of South China. The area was dominated by subtropical high-pressure systems on a planetary scale, combined with coastal mountains caused by sustained orogenic activity. The interaction between subtropical high pressure systems and topographic conditions ultimately caused the development of a tropical desert climate, characterized by an extensive dry climbing aeolian dune system. We propose that the coastal mountains not only blocked moisture transport from the ocean and led to the aridification of South China interior, but also exerted a control and transformed the original prevailing surface-wind pattern.",

        "abstract": "Metastasis-associsated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1), a newly identified oncogene, promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion. In the present study, the expression of MACC1, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor, MET proto-oncogene (c-Met), was investigated in human gastric cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues by immunohistochemistry. The association between the expression levels of the proteins and the clinicopathological parameters of the tumors were statistically analyzed. Furthermore, lentiviral particles expressing MACC1 were used to infect the hepatic satellite cell (HSC) line LX2. The expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA), HGF, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 in human HSCs was examined by western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transwell assays were used to measure the effect of MACC1-infected or non-infected HSCs on the migration and invasion abilities of MKN45 and MKN74 gastric carcinoma cells . The results demonstrated that positive protein expression of MACC1, HGF and c-Met was significantly higher in human gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Positive expression of MACC1 and c-Met in gastric cancer tissues had no correlation with the sex, age, tumor location and peritoneal metastasis of patients, but was significantly correlated with tumor size, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, histological differentiation, and overall (5 years) and disease-free survival (5 years). Positive expression of each MACC1, HGF and c-Met protein was demonstrated to be positively correlated with each other in human gastric cancer tissues. Western blotting results confirmed that MACC1 protein was overexpressed in MACC1-overexpressing lentivirus-infected HSCs. Overexpression of MACC1 significantly increased HGF, MMP-2, MMP-9 and \u03b1-SMA expression levels in HSCs. Results from the Transwell assays indicated an increase in the number of MKN45 or MKN74 cells migrating towards MACC1-overexpressing HSCs, compared with control HSCs. These findings suggested that MACC1 may regulate the expression of HGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in HSCs, and may thus promote migration and invasion of gastric carcinoma cells. MACC1, HGF and c-Met might cooperatively participate in the malignant progression of gastric cancer. In conclusion, MACC1 might serve as a useful molecular target for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of gastric cancer.",

The results showed that the thiols in the heavy fractions of hydrotreated gasoline were mainly the thiols with more carbon atoms than 5, which almost contained 92.1% of the total thiol sulfur. The thiol types in the heavy fractions of hydrotreated gasoline before and after caustic wash were almost similar, but the relative contents of every thiol were changed. After the caustic wash, the contents of n-pentanethiol and n-hexylmercaptan decreased, while the content of isomeric C 6 thiol and higher thiols than C 6 increased. Thiols in the heavy fraction of gasoline after treated by different sweetening processes with different sweetening degree were mainly thiophenol and higher thiols than C 6, and their amount was 81%-91%, which revealed that removal of the thiols with high relative molecular mass was difficult. Therefore, the removal of thiols with higher relative molecular mass in sweeting is crucial.",

Method: Samples of cultivated Anemarrhena Rhizome from most townships of Yi County were analyzed and compared with wild ones. Six indexes belonged to three kinds active constituents of saponin, flavomoid and polysaccharide were adopted. HPLC-ELSD method with cholesterol as internal standard was adopted to determine the content of sarsasapongenin. HPLC-ELSD method was used to simultaneously determine the contents of anemasaponin C and Anemasaponin A III. Contents of neomangiferin and mangiferin were determined by HPLC-UV method. Total polysaccharide was determined by phenol sulfate method. Result: The mean content of sarsasapongenin in cultivated Anemarrhena Rhizome samples is slightly lower than the wild. The mean contents of anemasaponin C and Anemasaponin A III in cultivated Anemarrhena Rhizome samples are higher than the wild. There is no notable difference of these three index between the cultivated and the wild. The cultivated Anemarrhena Rhizome samples have a lower content of neomangiferin and a higher content of mangiferin than the wild. While the total content of these two flavonoids have no notable difference. The cultivated Anemarrhena Rhizome samples have a higher content of total polysaccharide than the wild samples. Conclusion: Contents of active constituents in cultivated Anemarrhena Rhizome from Yi County (Xiling Zhimu) are not notably different with the wild Anemarrhena Rhizome. They have similar good quality as the wild ones.",

Despite of a lot of efforts, the best known upper bound of block sensitivity, as well as the certificate complexity, are still exponential in terms of sensitivity: $bs(f)leq C(f)leqmax{2^{s(f)-1}(s(f)-frac{1}{3}),s(f)}$. In this paper, we give a better upper bound of $bs(f)leq C(f)leq(frac{8}{9} + o(1))s(f)2^{s(f) - 1}$. The proof is based on a deep investigation on the structure of the sensitivity graph. We also provide a tighter relationship between $C_0(f)$ and $s_0(f)$ for functions with $s_1(f)=2$.",

        "abstract": "The problem of merging sorted lists in the least number of pairwise comparisons has been solved completely only for a few special cases. Graham and Karp [TAOCP, 1999] independently discovered that the tape merge algorithm is optimal in the worst case when the two lists have the same size. Stockmeyer and Yao [SICOMP, 1980], Murphy and Paull [Inform. Control, 1979], and Christen [1978] independently showed when the lists to be merged are of size m and n satisfying m leq n leq floor(3/2 m) + 1, the tape merge algorithm is optimal in the worst case. This paper extends this result by showing that the tape merge algorithm is optimal in the worst case whenever the size of one list is no larger than 1.52 times the size of the other. The main tool we used to prove lower bounds is Knuth\u2019s adversary methods [TAOCP, 1999]. In addition, we show that the lower bound cannot be improved to 1.8 via Knuthu0027s adversary methods. We also develop a new inequality about Knuthu0027s adversary methods, which might be interesting in its own right. Moreover, we design a simple procedure to achieve constant improvement of the upper bounds for 2m - 2 leq n leq 3m.",

        "title": "Efficient Delivery Policy to Minimize User Traffic Consumption in Guaranteed Advertising.",
        "abstract": "In this work, we study the guaranteed delivery model which is widely used in online display advertising. In the guaranteed delivery scenario, ad exposures (which are also called impressions in some works) to users are guaranteed by contracts signed in advance between advertisers and publishers. A crucial problem for the advertising platform is how to fully utilize the valuable user traffic to generate as much as possible revenue. Different from previous works which usually minimize the penalty of unsatisfied contracts and some other cost (e.g. representativeness), we propose the novel consumption minimization model, in which the primary objective is to minimize the user traffic consumed to satisfy all contracts. Under this model, we develop a near optimal method to deliver ads for users. The main advantage of our method lies in that it consumes nearly as least as possible user traffic to satisfy all contracts, therefore more contracts can be accepted to produce more revenue. It also enables the publishers to estimate how much user traffic is redundant or short so that they can sell or buy this part of traffic in bulk in the exchange market. Furthermore, it is robust with regard to priori knowledge of user type distribution. Finally, the simulation shows that our method outperforms the traditional state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "For each integer (mge 2), every Boolean function f can be expressed as a unique multilinear polynomial modulo m, and the degree of this multilinear polynomial is called its modulo m degree. In this paper we investigate the modulo degree complexity of total Boolean functions initiated by Parikshit Gopalan et al. [8], in which they asked the following question: whether the degree complexity of a Boolean function is polynomially related with its modulo m degree. For m be a power of primes, it is already known that the module m degree can be arbitrarily smaller compare to the degree complexity (see Sect. 2 for details). When m has at least two distinct prime factors, the question remains open. Towards this question, our results include: (1) we obtain some nontrivial equivalent forms of this question; (2) we affirm this question for some special classes of functions; (3) we prove a no-go theorem, explaining why this problem is difficult to attack from the computational complexity point of view; (4) we show a super-linear separation between the degree complexity and the modulo m degree.",

        "abstract": "The sensitivity conjecture, proposed by Nisan and Szegedy in 1994 [20] which asserts that for any Boolean function, its sensitivity complexity is polynomially related to the block sensitivity complexity, is one of the most important and challenging problems in the study of decision tree complexity. Despite of a lot of efforts, the best known upper bounds of block sensitivity, as well as the certificate complexity, is still exponential in terms of sensitivity [1, 5]. In this paper, we give a better upper bound for certificate complexity and block sensitivity, (bs(f)le C(f)le (frac{8}{9} + o(1))s(f)2^{s(f) - 1}), where bs(f), C(f) and s(f) are the block sensitivity, certificate complexity and sensitivity, respectively. The proof is based on a deep investigation on the structure of the sensitivity graph. We also provide a tighter relationship between the 0-certificate complexity (C_0(f)) and 0-sensitivity (s_0(f)) for functions with small 1-sensitivity (s_1(f)).",

This result disproves a conjecture of Babai, which conjectures that the sensitivity complexity of k-uniform hypergraph properties is at least Omega(n^{k/2}). We also investigate the sensitivity complexity of other weakly symmetric functions and show that for many classes of transitive-invariant Boolean functions the minimum achievable sensitivity complexity can be O(N^{1/3}), where N is the number of variables. Finally, we give a lower bound for sensitivity of k-uniform hypergraph properties, which implies the sensitivity conjecture of k-uniform hypergraph properties for any constant k.",

Next, based on Gallai-Edmonds Decomposition in matching theory, we give a concise formulation of the nucleolus for a typical case of TCMG which the threshold T equals 1.

Two of these axioms play critical roles in their system, however, it is coNP-complete to check whether they are satisfied. We propose efficiently-checkable alternatives to the two axioms, and prove that various desirable properties are preserved. Most strikingly, the new axioms enable to easily find constructive and consistent community functions. Actually, we find such a natural community function which is also enumerable and samplable, answering an open problem in the literature. We further discuss how to infer a corresponding preference network from a given collection of communities. We completely solve the problem when the simplest community rule is used, and uncover an inherent limitation of preference networks. Motivated by this observation, we extend the concept of preference to multi-preferences and prove that any collection of communities can be exactly generated by multi-preferences.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the top-k-selection problem, i.e. to determine and sort the top k elements, in the dynamic data model. Here dynamic means that the underlying total order evolves over time, and that the order can only be probed by pair-wise comparisons. It is assumed that at each time step, only one pair of elements can be compared. This assumption of restricted access is reasonable in the dynamic model, especially for massive data set where it is impossible to access all the data before the next change occurs. Previously only two special cases were studied [1] in this model: selecting the element of a given rank, and sorting all elements. This paper systematically deals with (kin [n]). Specifically, we identify the critical point (k^*) such that the top-k-selection problem can be solved error-free with probability (1-o(1)) if and only if (k=o(k^*)). A lower bound of the error when (k=varOmega (k^*)) is also determined, which actually is tight under some conditions. In contrast, we show that the top-k-set problem, which means finding the top k elements without sorting them, can be solved error-free with probability (1-o(1)) for all (1le kle n). Additionally, we consider some extensions of the dynamic data model and show that most of these results still hold.",

        "abstract": "Most studies on influence maximization focus on one-shot propagation, i.e., the influence is propagated from seed users only once following a probabilistic diffusion model and users\u2019 activation are determined via single cascade. In reality it is often the case that a user needs to be cumulatively impacted by receiving enough pieces of information propagated to her before she makes the final purchase decision. In this paper we model such cumulative activation as the following process: first multiple pieces of information are propagated independently in the social network following the classical independent cascade model, then the user will be activated (and adopt the product) if the cumulative pieces of information she received reaches her cumulative activation threshold. Two optimization problems are investigated under this framework: seed minimization with cumulative activation (SM-CA), which asks how to select a seed set with minimum size such that the number of cumulatively active nodes reaches a given requirement \u03b7; influence maximization with cumulative activation (IM-CA), which asks how to choose a seed set with fixed budget to maximize the number of cumulatively active nodes. For SM-CA problem, we design a greedy algorithm that yields a bicriteria O(ln n)-approximation when \u03b7 = n, where n is the number of nodes in the network. For both SM-CA problem with \u03b7 < n and IM-CA problem, we prove strong inapproximability results. Despite the hardness results, we propose two efficient heuristic algorithms for SM-CA and IM-CA respectively based on the reverse reachable set approach. Experimental results on different real-world social networks show that our algorithms significantly outperform baseline algorithms.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the top--selection problem, i.e. to determine and sort the top  elements, in the dynamic data model. Here  means that the underlying total order evolves over time, and that the order can only be probed by pair-wise comparisons. It is assumed that at each time step, only one pair of elements can be compared. This assumption of restricted access is reasonable in the dynamic model, especially for massive data sets where it is impossible to access all the data before the next change occurs. Previously only two special cases were studied (Anagnostopoulos et\u00a0al. in 36th international colloquium on automata, languages and programming (ICALP). LNCS, vol 5566, pp 339\u2013350, ) in this model: selecting the element of a given rank, and sorting all elements. This paper systematically deals with . Specifically, we identify the critical point  such that the top--selection problem can be solved error-free with probability  if and only if . A lower bound of the error when  is also determined, which actually is tight under some conditions. In contrast, we show that the top--set problem, which means finding the top  elements without sorting them, can be solved error-free with probability  for all . Additionally, we consider some extensions of the dynamic data model and show that most of these results still hold.",

In detail, we firstly introduce some more general unitary operators besides Clifford operators to find out local unitary equivalent sets as many as possible; and then we present two necessary conditions for two local unitary equivalent sets to prove the local inequivalence. According to this thought, we completely classify all the doublets in $dotimes d$ quantum system into the locally inequivalent doublets exactly with the number of $d$u0027s factors. Moreover, all the triplets in $p^alphaotimes p^alpha$ quantum system for prime can be partitioned into $frac{(alpha + 3)}{6}p^{alpha} + O(alpha p^{alpha-1})$ LU-inequivalent triplets, especially, when $alpha=2$ and $pu003e2$, there are exactly $lfloor frac{5}{6}p^{2}rfloor + lfloor frac{p-2}{6}+(-1)^{lfloorfrac{p}{3}rfloor}frac{p}{3}rfloor + 3$ LU-inequivalent triplets.",

There is one seller with m divisible goods and n buyers with unknown individual utility functions and budgets of money. The seller can repeatedly announce prices and observe aggregate demand bundles requested by the buyers. The goal of the seller is to learn the utility functions and budgets of the buyers. Our scenario falls into the classic domain of \\\"revealed preference\\\" analysis. Problems with revealed preference have recently started to attract increased interest in computer science due to their fundamental nature in understanding customer behavior in electronic markets. The goal of revealed preference analysis is to observe rational agent behavior, to explain it using a suitable model for the utility functions, and to predict future agent behavior. Our results are the first polynomial-time algorithms to learn utility and budget parameters via revealed preference queries in classic Fisher markets with multiple buyers. Our analysis concentrates on linear, CES, and Leontief markets, which are the most prominent classes studied in the literature. Some of our results extend to general Arrow-Debreu exchange markets.",

        "abstract": "String matching is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science. A natural problem is to find the number of characters that need to be queried (i.e. the decision tree complexity) in a string in order to determine whether this string contains a certain pattern. Rivest showed that for every pattern $p$, in the worst case any deterministic algorithm needs to query at least $n-|p|+1$ characters, where $n$ is the length of the string and $|p|$ is the length of the pattern. He further conjectured that these bounds are tight. By using adversary methods, Tuza disproved this conjecture and showed that more than half of binary patterns are evasive, i.e. any algorithm needs to query all the characters. In this paper, we give a query algorithm which settles the decision tree complexity for almost all patterns. Using the algebraic approach of Rivest and Vuillemin we give a new sufficient condition for the evasiveness of patterns, which reveals an interesting connection to Skolemu0027s Problem.",

        "abstract": "Mobile devices become more and more prevalent in recent years, especially in young groups. The rapid progress of mobile devices promotes the development of M-Commerce business. The purchase on mobile terminals accounts for a considerable percentage in the total trading volume of E-Commerce and begins to draw the attention of E-Commerce corporation. Alibaba held a Mobile Recommendation Algorithm Competition aiming to recommend appropriate items for mobile users at the right time and place. The dataset provided by Alibaba consists of about 6 billion operation logs made by 5 million Taobao users towards over 150 million items spanning a period of one month. Compared with traditional scenarios in purchase predicting, the competition raised three challenges: (1)The dataset is too large to be processed in personal computers, (2)Some days with great discounts provided by Taobao Marketplace are within the period of dataset, (3)Positive samples are too few compared to the dimension of features. In this paper we study the problem of predicting the purchase behaviour of M-Commerce users, by exploring the solution for Alibaba's Mobile Recommendation Algorithm Competition. We first deeply study the habit of customers and filter many outliers. After that we adopt the method of \\\"sliding window\\\" to supply positive samples of training dataset and smooth the burst of sales near Dec 12th. We design a feature engineering framework to extract 6 categories of features that aim to capture the buying potential of user-item pairs. Our features exploit the interaction of user-item pair, user's shopping habit and item' attraction for users. Then we apply Gradient Boost Decision Trees (GBDT) as the training model. In the end, we combine outputs of individual GBDT together by Logistic Regression to get the final predictions. Our solution achieves 8.66% F1 score, and ranks the third place in the final round.",

        "abstract": "Lov\u00e1sz Local Lemma (LLL) is a very powerful tool in combinatorics and probability theory to show the possibility of avoiding all \u201cbad\u201d events under some \u201cweakly dependent\u201d condition. Over the last decades, the algorithmic aspect of LLL has also attracted lots of attention in theoretical computer science. A tight criterion under which the abstract version LLL (ALLL) holds was given by Shearer. It turns out that Shearer\u2019s bound is generally not tight for variable version LLL (VLLL). Recently, Ambainis et al. introduced a quantum version LLL (QLLL), which was then shown to be powerful for the quantum satisfiability problem. \n\n In this paper, we prove that Shearer\u2019s bound is tight for QLLL, i.e., the relative dimension of the smallest satisfying subspace is completely characterized by the independent set polynomial, affirming a conjecture proposed by Sattath et al. Our result also shows the tightness of Gily\u00e9n and Sattath\u2019s algorithm, and implies that the lattice gas partition function fully characterizes quantum satisfiability for almost all Hamiltonians with large enough qudits. \n\n Commuting LLL (CLLL), LLL for commuting local Hamiltonians which are widely studied in the literature, is also investigated here. We prove that the tight regions of CLLL and QLLL are different in general. This result might imply that it is possible to design an algorithm for CLLL which is still efficient beyond Shearer\u2019s bound. \n\n In applications of LLLs, the symmetric cases are most common, i.e., the events are with the same probability and the Hamiltonians are with the same relative dimension. We give the first lower bound on the gap between the symmetric VLLL and Shearer\u2019s bound. Our result can be viewed as a quantitative study on the separation between quantum and classical constraint satisfaction problems. Additionally, we obtain similar results for the symmetric CLLL. As an application, we give lower bounds on the critical thresholds of VLLL and CLLL for several of the most common lattices.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Development of natural protein-based fibrous scaffolds with tunable physical properties and biocompatibility is highly desirable to construct three-dimensional (3D), fully cellularized scaffolds for wound healing. Herein, we demonstrated a simple and effective technique to construct electrospun 3D fibrous scaffolds for accelerated wound healing using a photocrosslinkable hydrogel based on gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA). We found that the physical properties of the photocrosslinkable hydrogel including water retention, stiffness, strength, elasticity and degradation can be tailored by changing the light exposure time. We further observed that the optimized hydrogel fibrous scaffolds which were soft and elastic could support cell adhesion, proliferation and migration into the whole scaffolds, facilitating regeneration and formation of cutaneous tissues within two weeks. Such tunable characteristics of the fibrous GelMA scaffolds distinguished them from other reported substrates developed for reconstruction of wound defects including glutaraldehyde-crosslinked gelatin or poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), whose physical and chemical properties were difficult to modify to allow cell infiltration into the 3D scaffolds for tissue regeneration. We anticipate that the ability to become fully cellularized will make the engineered GelMA fibrous scaffolds suitable for widespread applications as skin substitutes or wound dressings. Statement of Significance In present study, we generate three-dimensional photocrosslinkable gelatin (GelMA)-based fibrous scaffolds with tunable physical and biological properties by using a combined photocrosslinking/electrospinning approach. The developed GelMA fibrous scaffolds can not only support cell viability and cell adhesion, but also facilitate cell migration and proliferation, accelerating regeneration and formation of cutaneous tissues. In addition, the physical properties of the engineered fibrous GelMA hydrogel including water retention capability, mechanical properties and biodegradability can be tuned to accommodate different patients\u2019 needs, making it a promising candidate for skin tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Local drug delivery systems have become an important field of research as locally administration of medications may overcome most of the drawbacks associated with systemic drugs. Still, to assure continuous drug release and therapeutic drug levels, keeping the delivered drug in target area remains a physiological challenge. The aim of this study was to develop novel multipotent flap-protective adhesive mangiferin (MF)-loaded liposomes (A-MF-Lip), bioinspired in mussel architecture, for the promotion of random skin flap regeneration. The long chain 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-poly(ethyleneglycol)-dopamine (DSPE-PEG-DOPA) was successful combined in liposomes, being dopamine (DOPA) with terminated catechol attached at the end of chain to explore the potential ability in adherence. A-MF-Lip presented a mean particle size of 162\u202fnm, and MF cumulative release reaching 82% up to 72\u202fh. A-MF-Lip adhesive ability was significantly higher compared to non-adhesive mangiferin-loaded liposome (MF-Lip). Moreover, a positive effect of A-MF-Lip on cells proliferation, angiogenesis was observed. And by regulating the PPAR-\u03b3/NF-\u03baB pathway, the A-MF-Lip established a protection effect on hypoxia induced cell apoptosis and inflammation. After locally injection delivery in a Sprague Dawley rat random skin flap model, A-MF-Lip significantly decreased flap necrosis rate and reduced flap inflammation. Therefore, A-MF-Lip is a promising multipotent flap-protective approach for random skin flap regeneration.",

Here, a multifunctional and dynamic coordinative polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel with mangiferin liposomes (MF-Lip@PEG) is developed for clinical applications through Ag-S coordination of four-arm-PEG-SH and Ag. Compared to MF-PEG, MF-Lip@PEG exhibits self-healing properties, lower swelling percentages, and a longer endurance period. Moreover, the hydrogel exhibits excellent drug dispersibility and release characteristics for slow and persistent drug delivery. In vitro studies show that the hydrogel is biocompatible and nontoxic to cells, and exerts an outstanding neovascularization-promoting effect. The MF-Lip@PEG also exhibits a strong cytoprotective effect against hypoxia-induced apoptosis through regulation of the Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 pathway. In a random skin flap animal model, the MF-Lip@PEG is injectable and convenient to deliver into the skin flap, providing excellent anti-inflammation, anti-infection, and proneovascularization effects and significantly reducing the skin flap necrosis rate. In general, the MF-Lip@PEG possesses outstanding multifunctionality for the dynamic healing process of skin flap regeneration.",

The development of 3D functional vascular networks is fundamental for the survival of a local random skin flap. Herein, an effective technique on constructing 3D fibrous scaffolds for accelerated vascularization is demonstrated using a photocrosslinkable natural hydrogel based on gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) by electrospinning. It is found that the ultraviolet (UV) photocrosslinkable gelatin electrospun hydrogel fibrous membranes exhibit soft adjustable mechanical properties and controllable degradation properties. Furthermore, it is observed that the optimized hydrogel scaffolds can support endothelial cells and dermal fibroblasts adhesion, proliferation, and migration into the scaffolds, which facilitates vascularization. Importantly, a rapid formation of tubes is observed after 3 d seeding of endothelial cells. After GelMA fibrous scaffold implantation below the skin flap in a rat model, it is found that the flap survival rate is higher than the control group, and there is more microvascular formation, which is potentially beneficial for the flap tissue vascularization. These data suggest that GelMA hydrogels can be used for biomedical applications that require the formation of microvascular networks, including the development of complex engineered tissues.",

It is a key step to adjust the stiffness of biomaterials for inducing stem cells to promote vascularization in order to promote damaged tissue repair. In this study, we transplant adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) within an  in situ  forming dextran hydrogel with controllable mechanical strength formed by cross-linking glycidyl methacrylate derivatized dextran and dithiothreitol, which can regulate the stemness and biological functions of stem cells. We show that softer dextran hydrogel can better maintain stemness markers expression of ADSCs, and significantly stimulate ADSCs to secrete angiogenic factors. The ADSCs-encapsulated hydrogel distinctly promote the skin flap survival compared to direct cell injection. Bioluminescence imaging analysis shows that  in situ  forming dextran hydrogel can improve cells retention, and postmortem analysis reveals that the transplanted ADSCs with hydrogel can promote vascularization. These results support the use of injectable dextran hydrogel for skin ischemia tissue regeneration.",

However, the current strategies of adding bFGF generally cause degradation of electrospun materials or damage to the bioactivity of the biomolecules. Here, we have developed a simple strategy for surface bFGF-functionalization of electrospun fibers in an aqueous solution, which maintained original fiber properties and growth factor bioactivity. Polydopamine (PDA) forming the mussel foot protein was chosen as an adhesive polymeric bridge-layer between substrate poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) fibers and bFGF. The bFGF-grafted PDA was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, water contact angle measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Improved hydrophilicity together with a stable fibrous structure and biodegradable fibrous matrix suggested that the PLGA/PDA-bFGF electrospun fibrous scaffolds have great potential for promoting wound healing. In vitro experiments showed that the bFGF-grafted PLGA electrospun fibrous scaffolds have highly enhanced adhesion, viability, and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts. In vivo results showed that such scaffolds shortened wound healing time, accelerated epithelialization and promoted skin remodeling. Therefore, this PDA modification method can be a useful tool to graft biomolecules onto polymeric electrospun fibrous scaffolds which are potential scaffold candidates for repairing skin tissue.",

        "abstract": "A new data product from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) called Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs) is now available. SDO/HMI is the first space-based instrument to map the full-disk photospheric vector magnetic field with high cadence and continuity. The SHARP data series provide maps in patches that encompass automatically tracked magnetic concentrations for their entire lifetime; map quantities include the photospheric vector magnetic field and its uncertainty, along with Doppler velocity, continuum intensity, and line-of-sight magnetic field. Furthermore, keywords in the SHARP data series provide several parameters that concisely characterize the magnetic-field distribution and its deviation from a potential-field configuration. These indices may be useful for active-region event forecasting and for identifying regions of interest. The indices are calculated per patch and are available on a twelve-minute cadence. Quick-look data are available within approximately three hours of observation; definitive science products are produced approximately five weeks later. SHARP data are available at  jsoc.stanford.edu  and maps are available in either of two different coordinate systems. This article describes the SHARP data products and presents examples of SHARP data and parameters.",

An automated processing pipeline keeps pace with observations to produce observable quantities, including the photospheric vector magnetic field, from sequences of filtergrams. The basic vector-field frame list cadence is 135 seconds, but to reduce noise the filtergrams are combined to derive data products every 720 seconds. The primary 720\u00a0s observables were released in mid-2010, including Stokes polarization parameters measured at six wavelengths, as well as intensity, Doppler velocity, and the line-of-sight magnetic field. More advanced products, including the full vector magnetic field, are now available. Automatically identified HMI Active Region Patches (HARPs) track the location and shape of magnetic regions throughout their lifetime.",

The results of study showed that the excavation footage and horizontal stress had a significant influence on the deformation of surrounding rock of deep-buried soft rock tunnel; the surrounding rock had obvious asymmetrical deformation, and the key position of failure was located at the top and right side of tunnel; the uncoordinated deformation areas were the potential dangerous destruction areas of surrounding rock; and the surrounding rock of tunnel was destroyed under the combined action of tension and compression stress.",

During the process of excavation, an infrared camera and a full-field strain measurement system were employed to obtain the thermal response and deformation of surrounding rock. Meanwhile, strain rosettes were used to measuring the strain of surrounding rocks, which were installed with a circular layout pattern in the surrounding rocks. Deformation failure mechanism of surrounding rocks was investigated by synthetic analysis of the infrared images, experimental pictures, and displacement field images. A numerical model was implemented to compare the displacement results of the physical model. The results showed that driving footage produced an effect on the deformation of surrounding rock, the bedding plane had an inevitable influence on the deformation of surrounding rock during the excavation processes and temperature variations of surrounding rock can reflect the behavior change of surrounding rock.",

During the processes of roadway floor heave, infrared thermography and video camera were employed for capturing the thermal response and displacement of roadway\u2019s section, meanwhile, strain gauges installed with a circular layout in surrounding rocks was used for measuring roadway sectional deformation. Floor heave and failure was investigated by the combined analyses of the acquired infrared images, video photographs and straining field variations. A numerical model was also implemented based on the physical model for verifying the tunnel displacements obtained by image analysis of the photographs. The results showed that the horizontal stress had a great effect on the floor heave failure and the rock mass failure was accompanied with abnormal temperature change.",

        "abstract": "In order to analyze the deformation characteristics and mechanisms caused by high tectonic stress in gentle dip strata, a physical modeling with circular tunnel was designed. The model was constructed by the so-called \u201cPhysically Finite Elemental Slab Assemblage (PFESA)\u201d to bring about the structural effect of the deep strata. The gravity was fixed while the lateral pressure increased step by step to mimic high tectonic stress. In order to observe the displacement in different area, the sketches of monitoring points and frame in the model surface were drawn down through video pictures in different periods and to be compared. For the sake of analyzing the deformation and failure mechanism of layers, rock structural mechanics models were set up for the left side and right side in the same stratum, respectively. For verifying the experimental phenomenon and its mechanism, infrared images were utilized based on the temperature variation mechanisms of material. Through systematic study, this paper enriches the research methods of model test and can provide a certain reference for practical engineering of similar conditions.",

        "abstract": "A current challenge for ecological research in agriculture is to identify ways in which to improve the resilience of the soil food web to extreme climate events, such as severe rainfall. Plant species composition influence soil biota communities differently, which might affect the recovery of soil food web after extreme rainfall. We compared the effects of rainfall stress up on the soil microbial food web in three planting systems: a monoculture of the focal species Zanthoxylum bungeanum and mixed cultures of Z. bungeanum and Medicago sativa or Z. bungeanum and Glycine max. We tested the effect of the presence of a legume on the recovery of trophic interactions between microorganisms and nematodes after extreme rainfall. Our results indicated that all chemical properties of the soil recovered to control levels (normal rainfall) in the three planting systems 45\u202fdays after exposure to extreme rain. However, on day 45, the bulk microbial community differed from controls in the monoculture treatment, but not in the two mixed planting treatments. The nematode community did not fully recover in the monoculture or Z. bungeanum and M. sativa treatments, while nematode populations in the combined Z. bungeanum and G. max treatment were indistinguishable from controls. G. max performed better than M. sativa in terms of increasing the resilience of microbial and nematode communities to extreme rainfall. Soil microbial biomass and nematode density were positively correlated with the available carbon and nitrogen content in soil, demonstrating a link between soil health and biological properties. This study demonstrated that certain leguminous plants can stabilize the soil food web via interactions with soil biota communities after extreme rainfall.",

To determine the optimal levels of quality, placement and quantity of straw mulching, we performed a field experiment that used the Box-Behnken design combined with response surface methodology. The treatments designed for walnut saplings (Juglans regia) considered three independent variables: quality, placement, and quantity of straw mulching. Tree height of walnut saplings (THW) and net photosynthesis rate (NPR) were\u00a0used as the response variables in a full, quadratic polynomial model. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results showed that the selected models were significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05), expressing ideal relationships between the independent and dependent variables (R\u2009\u2265\u20090.9225). The optimum conditions for the THW and NPR responses were determined to be a straw mulching quality which mixed rice and rapeseed straws, a straw mulching placement which covered the entire soil surface of experimental plots, and a straw mulching quantity applied as 3\u2009kg/m (i.e., the low level). This optimized scheme of straw mulching combinations offers an alternate choice for optimizing the growth and potential yield of walnut saplings, but practical field experiments should also be carried out to obtain more site-specific results.",

The results indicated that, extreme rainfall had significantly negative impacts on Z. bungeanum in three intercropping systems. However, intercropping with G. max improved the transpiration rate (T) and stomatal conductance (G), raised leaf relative water content (LRWC), increased chlorophyll a (Chl a) and carotenoid (Car) content, and enhanced the superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) of Z. bungeanum. After recovery, the Z. bungeanum\u2009+\u2009G. max mixed culture significantly increased soil NO-N, improved the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (C) and T, upregulated soluble sugar and proline, and enhanced hydrogen peroxidase activity (CAT). Moreover, the higher root biomass of G. max provided much more nitrogen for Z. bungeanum via the return of organic matter. However, intercropping with C. annum significantly increased active oxygen (ROS). Compared with neighboring species, in intercropping systems, G. max could have improved the tolerance of the focal species Z. bungeanum in response to extreme rainfall and its recovery after extreme rainfall.",

        "abstract": "Eucalyptus grandis is the most widely planted tree species worldwide and can face severe drought during the initial months after planting because the root system is developing. A complete randomized design was used to study the effects of two water regimes (well-watered and water-stressed) and phosphorus (P) applications (with and without P) on the morphological and physio-biochemical responses of E. grandis. Drought had negative effects on the growth and metabolism of E. grandis, as indicated by changes in morphological traits, decreased net photosynthetic rates (P ), pigment concentrations, leaf relative water contents (LRWCs), nitrogenous compounds, over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and higher lipid peroxidation. However, E. grandis showed effective drought tolerance strategies, such as reduced leaf area and transpiration rate (E), higher accumulation of soluble sugars and proline, and a strong antioxidative enzyme system. P fertilization had positive effects on well-watered seedlings due to improved growth and photosynthesis, which indicated the high P requirements during the initial E. grandis growth stage. In drought-stressed seedlings, P application had no effects on the morphological traits, but it significantly improved the LRWC, P , quantum efficiency of photosystem II (F /F ), chlorophyll pigments, nitrogenous compounds, and reduced lipid peroxidation. P fertilization improved E. grandis seedling growth under well-watered conditions but also ameliorated some leaf physiological traits under drought conditions. The effects of P fertilization are mainly due to the enhancement of plant N nutrition. Therefore, P can be used as a fertilizer to improve growth and production in the face of future climate change.

        "abstract": "Summary  Natural killer (NK) cells control viral infection in part through the interaction between killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands. We investigated 504 anti-retroviral (ART)-free Japanese patients chronically infected with HIV-1 and identified two KIR/HLA combinations, KIR2DL2/HLA-C \u2217 12:02 and KIR2DL2/HLA-C \u2217 14:03, that impact suppression of HIV-1 replication. KIR2DL2 +  NK cells suppressed viral replication in HLA-C \u2217 14:03 +  or HLA-C \u2217 12:02 +  cells to a significantly greater extent than did KIR2DL2 \u2212  NK cells in\u00a0vitro. Functional analysis showed that the binding between HIV-1-derived peptide and HLA-C \u2217 14:03 or HLA-C \u2217 12:02 influenced KIR2DL2 +  NK cell activity through reduced expression of the peptide-HLA (pHLA) complex on the cell surface (i.e., reduced KIR2DL2 ligand expression), rather than through reduced binding affinity of KIR2DL2 to the respective pHLA complexes. Thus, KIR2DL2/HLA-C \u2217 12:02 and KIR2DL2/HLA-C \u2217 14:03 compound genotypes have protective effects on control of HIV-1 through a mechanism involving KIR2DL2-mediated NK cell recognition of virus-infected\u00a0cells, providing additional understanding of NK cells in HIV-1 infection.",

Y135F viruses carry the 2F mutation within RW8 and RF10, which are two HLA-A\u221724:02-restricted superimposed Nef epitopes recognized by distinct and adaptable CD8+ T cell responses. We combined comprehensive analysis of the T cell receptor repertoire and cross-reactive potential of wild-type or 2F RW8- and RF10-specific CD8+ T cells with peptide-MHC complex stability and crystal structure studies. We find that, by affecting direct and water-mediated hydrogen bond networks within the peptide-MHC complex, the 2F mutation reduces both TCR and HLA binding. This suggests an advantage underlying the evolution of the 2F variant with decreased CD8+ T cell efficacy. Our study provides a refined understanding of HIV-1 and CD8+ T cell co-adaptation at the population level.",

A sample prepared at a carbonisation temperature of 600\u00a0\u00b0C with a specific surface area of 781\u00a0m 2 \u00a0g \u22121  and a pore volume of 0.68\u00a0cm 3 \u00a0g \u22121  displayed the best electrocapacitive performance. The well-developed porous structure coupled with the presence of nitrogen-containing functional groups along with nascent hydrogen enabled this sample to exhibit specific capacitances of 248 and 133\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  at current densities of 0.1 and 10\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 , respectively, in a symmetric cell with 1\u00a0M aqueous H 2 SO 4  solution as the electrolyte. With this electrode, about 89% of the initial capacitance is retained after 2000 cycles at a current density of 1\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 . A symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using this carbon in both electrodes exhibits an energy density of 14.6\u00a0Wh\u00a0Kg \u22121  at a power density of 63.5\u00a0W\u00a0Kg \u22121  and remains at 7.9\u00a0Wh\u00a0Kg \u22121  at a power density of 6500 W\u00a0Kg \u22121 .",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sodium-ion capacitors (NICs) are a hybrid energy storage system that store energy via both charge adsorption at the cathode/electrolyte interface and charge intercalation in the bulk of the anode, thereby possessing a higher energy density than supercapacitors and a higher power density than batteries. In this work, nickel cobaltite (NiCo 2 O 4 ) hollow spheres with a chestnut shell morphology have been solvothermally synthesized and tested in a sodium half-cell. The NiCo 2 O 4  material exhibits a reversible capacity of 313\u00a0mAh g \u22121  at 1\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 . Pre-sodiation of NiCo 2 O 4  is found to significantly improve its energy density. A NIC fabricated with pre-sodiated NiCo 2 O 4  as the anode and an activated carbon (AC) as the cathode delivers an energy density of 60\u00a0Wh kg \u22121  at the power density of 10,000\u00a0W\u00a0kg \u22121 .  Ex-situ  X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results reveal that NiCo 2 O 4  is converted to metallic nickel and cobalt and Na 2 O phases during the pre-sodiation. The metallic nickel and cobalt phases are kinetically favourable for the electrolyte diffusion and electrochemical reactions, thus significantly improving the performance of the pre-sodiated NiCo 2 O 4  electrode.",

Graphene oxide thermally expands in a vacuum and simultaneously nickel(II) acetylacetonate decomposes to form NiO nanoparticles between graphene layers. This method not only allows the uniform dispersion of NiO nanoparticles between graphene layers but also enables simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide. The structural and electrochemical advantages of both reduced graphene oxide and nanoscale NiO particles are maintained. The reduced graphene oxide\u2013NiO composite exhibits a specific capacitance of 880 F g\u22121 at a current density of 1 A g\u22121 in 6 M KOH and a 93.1% retention of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles at 5 A g\u22121.",

        "abstract": "Hierarchical porous carbon prepared with calcium-containing nanocrystalline beta zeolite as the template and ethylene as the carbon source at a relatively low carbonization temperature (600 \u00b0C) displayed excellent electrocapacitive properties. The presence of both micro/mesopores and surface oxygen-containing groups on the ordered porous structure, along with a high specific surface area (2280 m2 g\u22121) and pore volume (1.95 cm3 g\u22121) coupled with good wettability towards the electrolyte enabled the carbon to perform well as a supercapacitor electrode. This carbon electrode achieved a specific capacitance of 250 F g\u22121 at a current density of 1 A g\u22121 with 1 M H2SO4 as the aqueous electrolyte measured in a three-electrode system. A symmetric capacitor fabricated with the carbon as both electrodes exhibited a specific capacitance of 161 F g\u22121 at a current density of 1 A g\u22121, and an excellent cycling stability. After being cycled 17\u2006000 times and shelved for another two months, the electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 246 F g\u22121 at 1 A g\u22121, 153% of the initial capacitance, and still maintained an excellent cycle stability. Besides, an all-solid-state supercapacitor cell fabricated with this carbon as both electrodes and polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4 gel as the electrolyte displayed an areal specific capacitance of 413 mF cm\u22122 at a current density of 0.25 mA cm\u22122.",

Dispersed manganese oxide particles were precipitated on the graphite oxide surfaces from KMnO4 added during the synthesis of graphite oxide by using a modified Hummersu0027 method. The morphology and crystalline phase of the manganese oxide can be controlled by adjusting the mass ratio of KMnO4/graphite. The sample prepared with a KMnO4/graphite mass ratio of 2 contained nanoflowers of MnO2 phase and exhibited a specific capacitance of 120 F g\u22121 in 6 M KOH at a current density of 0.2 A g\u22121.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sodium-ion capacitors with unique characteristics such as higher energy density than electrical double-layer capacitors, higher power density than rechargeable batteries, and abundant sodium resources represent current research trend in developing large-scale electrical energy storage technology. One of the key challenges presently facing the development of this technology is the imbalanced kinetics between the sluggish Faradaic sodium insertion in the anode and the fast capacitive ion adsorption on the cathode. Here we demonstrate the sol-gel synthesis of a novel, high-rate, stable composite anode material for sodium-ion capacitors (NICs). The composite consisted of Nb 2 O 5  nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix (denoted by m-Nb 2 O 5 /C). Sodium-ion capacitors employing the m-Nb 2 O 5 /C anode and a commercial activated carbon as the cathode showed an admirable performance, delivering high energy densities in a wide range of power densities (73\u202fWh kg \u22121 @250\u202fW kg-1 and 16.8\u202fWh kg \u22121 @20\u202fkW\u202fkg \u22121 ). These favourable cell characteristics are attributed to the properties of the m-Nb 2 O 5 /C anode: the mesoporous structure that facilitates electron and ion transport, the presence of the niobium carbide interlayer between the Nb 2 O 5  nanoparticles and the surrounding graphitic carbon that additionally improves the electron conductivity, and the predominant capacitive charge storage mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Apoptosis in megakaryocytes results in the formation of platelets. The role of apoptotic pathways in platelet turnover and in the apoptotic-like changes seen after platelet activation is poorly understood. ABT-263 (Navitoclax), a specific inhibitor of antiapoptotic BCL2 proteins, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia and other malignancies, induces a dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. In this study, the relationship between BCL2/BCL-X(L) inhibition, apoptosis, and platelet activation was investigated. Exposure to ABT-263 induced apoptosis but repressed platelet activation by physiologic agonists. Notably, ABT-263 induced an immediate calcium response in platelets and the depletion of intracellular calcium stores, indicating that on BCL2/BCL-X(L) inhibition platelet activation is abrogated because of a diminished calcium signaling. By comparing the effects of ABT-263 and its analog ABT-737 on platelets and leukemia cells from the same donor, we show, for the first time, that these BCL2/BCL-X(L) inhibitors do not offer any selective toxicity but induce apoptosis at similar concentrations in leukemia cells and platelets. However, reticulated platelets are less sensitive to apoptosis, supporting the hypothesis that treatment with ABT-263 induces a selective loss of older platelets and providing an explanation for the transient thrombocytopenia observed on ABT-263 treatment.",

        "abstract": "The major surface lipoglycan of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), is an immunosuppressive epitope of M. tb. We used systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to generate an aptamer (ZXL1) that specifically bound to ManLAM from the virulent M. tb strain H37Rv. Aptamer ZXL1 had the highest binding affinity, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 436.3\u2009\u00b1\u200937.84 nmol/l, and competed with the mannose receptor for binding to ManLAM and M. tb H37Rv. ZXL1 significantly inhibited the ManLAM-induced immunosuppression of CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and enhanced the M. tb antigen-presenting activity of DCs for naive CD4(+) Th1 cell activation. More importantly, we demonstrated that injection of aptamer ZXL1 significantly reduced the progression of M. tb H37Rv infections and bacterial loads in lungs of mice and rhesus monkeys. These results suggest that the aptamer ZXL1 is a new potential antimycobacterial agent and tuberculosis vaccine immune adjuvant.",

Here, an ssDNA aptamer \u201cantibody\u201d BM2 specifically bound to the mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) of BCG was selected. BM2 significantly blocked ManLAM\u2013mannose receptor (MR) binding, triggered ManLAM\u2013CD44 signaling, and enhanced M1 macrophage and Th1 activation via cellular surface CD44 in vitro and in vivo. BM2 enhanced immunoprotective effects of BCG against virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv infection in mice and monkeys models. Thus, we report a new mechanism of the interaction between ManLAM and CD44 on macrophages and CD4+ T cells and reveal that ManLAM-binding membrane molecule CD44 is a novel target for the enhancement of BCG immunogenicity, and BM2 ha...",

        "abstract": "Although dendritic cells are among the human cell population best equipped for cell-intrinsic antiviral immune defense, they seem highly susceptible to infection with the Zika virus (ZIKV). Using highly purified myeloid dendritic cells isolated from individuals with naturally acquired acute infection, we here show that ZIKV induces profound perturbations of transcriptional signatures relative to healthy donors. Interestingly, we noted a remarkable downregulation of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes and innate immune sensors, suggesting that ZIKV can actively suppress interferon-dependent immune responses. In contrast, several host factors known to support ZIKV infection were strongly upregulated during natural ZIKV infection; these transcripts included AXL, the main entry receptor for ZIKV; SOCS3, a negative regulator of ISG expression; and IDO-1, a recognized inducer of regulatory T\u00a0cell responses. Thus, during in\u00a0vivo infection, ZIKV can transform the transcriptome of dendritic cells in favor of the virus to render these cells highly conducive to ZIKV infection.",

        "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a reemerging flavivirus causing an ongoing pandemic and public health emergency worldwide. There are currently no effective vaccines or specific therapy for Zika infection. Rapid, low-cost diagnostics for mass screening and early detection are of paramount importance in timely management of the infection at the point-of-care (POC). The current Zika diagnostics are laboratory-based and cannot be implemented at the POC particularly in resource-limited settings. Here, we develop a nanoparticle-enhanced viral lysate electrical sensing assay for Zika virus detection on paper microchips with printed electrodes. The virus is isolated from biological samples using antibodies and labeled with platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) to enhance the electrical signal. The captured ZIKV-PtNP complexes are lysed using a detergent to release the electrically charged molecules associated with the intact virus and the PtNPs on the captured viruses. The released charged molecules and PtNPs change the electrical conductivity of the solution, which can be measured on a cellulose paper microchip with screen-printed microelectrodes. The results confirmed a highly specific detection of ZIKV in the presence of other non-targeted viruses, including closely related flaviviruses such as dengue virus-1 and dengue virus-2 with a detection limit down to 101 virus particles per \u03bcl. The developed assay is simple, rapid, and cost-effective and has the potential for POC diagnosis of viral infections and treatment monitoring.",

        "abstract": "HIV-1 causes a chronic, incurable disease due to its persistence in CD4+ T cells that contain replication-competent provirus, but exhibit little or no active viral gene expression and effectively resist combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These latently infected T cells represent an extremely small proportion of all circulating CD4+ T cells but possess a remarkable long-term stability and typically persist throughout life, for reasons that are not fully understood. Here we performed massive single-genome, near-full-length next-generation sequencing of HIV-1 DNA derived from unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, ex vivo-isolated CD4+ T cells, and subsets of functionally polarized memory CD4+ T cells. This approach identified multiple sets of independent, near-full-length proviral sequences from cART-treated individuals that were completely identical, consistent with clonal expansion of CD4+ T cells harboring intact HIV-1. Intact, near-full-genome HIV-1 DNA sequences that were derived from such clonally expanded CD4+ T cells constituted 62% of all analyzed genome-intact sequences in memory CD4 T cells, were preferentially observed in Th1-polarized cells, were longitudinally detected over a duration of up to 5 years, and were fully replication- and infection-competent. Together, these data suggest that clonal proliferation of Th1-polarized CD4+ T cells encoding for intact HIV-1 represents a driving force for stabilizing the pool of latently infected CD4+ T cells.",

        "abstract": "Chromosomal integration of genome-intact HIV-1 sequences into the host genome creates a reservoir of virally infected cells that persists throughout life, necessitating indefinite antiretroviral suppression therapy. During effective antiviral treatment, the majority of these proviruses remain transcriptionally silent, but mechanisms responsible for viral latency are insufficiently clear. Here, we used matched integration site and proviral sequencing (MIP-Seq), an experimental approach involving multiple displacement amplification of individual proviral species, followed by near-full-length HIV-1 next-generation sequencing and corresponding chromosomal integration site analysis to selectively map the chromosomal positions of intact and defective proviruses in 3 HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing long-term antiretroviral therapy. Simultaneously, chromatin accessibility and gene expression in autologous CD4+ T cells were analyzed by assays for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq) and RNA-Seq. We observed that in comparison to proviruses with defective sequences, intact HIV-1 proviruses were enriched for non-genic chromosomal positions and more frequently showed an opposite orientation relative to host genes. In addition, intact HIV-1 proviruses were preferentially integrated in either relative proximity to or increased distance from active transcriptional start sites and to accessible chromatin regions. These studies strongly suggest selection of intact proviruses with features of deeper viral latency during prolonged antiretroviral therapy, and may be informative for targeting the genome-intact viral reservoir.",

        "abstract": "HIV post-treatment controllers (PTCs) represent a natural model of sustained HIV remission, but they are rare and little is known about their viral reservoir. We obtained 1450 proviral sequences after near-full-length amplification for 10 PTCs and 16 post-treatment non-controllers (NCs). Before treatment interruption, the median intact and total reservoir size in PTCs was 7-fold lower than in NCs, but the proportion of intact, defective and total clonally-expanded viral genomes was not significantly different between the two groups. Quantification of total, but not intact, proviral genome copies predicted sustained HIV remission as 81% of NCs, but none of the PTCs, had a total proviral genome >4 copies per million PBMCs. The results highlight the restricted intact and defective HIV reservoir in PTCs and suggest that total proviral genome burden could act as the first biomarker for identifying PTCs. Defective, but not intact, proviral copy numbers correlated with levels of cell-associated HIV RNA, activated NK cell percentages and both HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ responses. These results support the concept that defective HIV genomes lead to viral antigen production and interact with both the innate and adaptive immune systems.",

The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, HRSEM, SEM and UV\u2013vis to find out the impact of pH values. Photocatalytic ability of BiOCl catalysts were evaluated by oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury under UV light irradiation. It was found that BiOCl catalysts prepared under alkaline condition exhibited the best photocatalytic oxidation activities. The difference of photocatalytic activity among the as-prepared catalysts can be attribute to the growth orientation of the crystal BiOCl catalyst and the adsorption capacity of elemental mercury.",

Fabrication of BiOIO 3  photocatalysts by calcination method was investigated for the first time. XRD patterns showed that the crystallinity of BiOIO 3  photocatalysts could be controlled by calcination temperature. TGA demonstrated that calcining the precursor at a specific temperature range was appropriate for preparing BiOIO 3  photocatalysts. XPS and FT-IR characterization revealed that the BiOIO 3  photocatalysts prepared by calcination method possessed oxygen vacancies, which acted as the positive charge centers to trap the electron easily, inhibiting the recombination of photo electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, PL spectra confirmed the oxygen vacancies can favor for the separation of the electron-hole pairs and in turn enhance the photocatalytic performance. From the above analysis, the mechanism of preparing BiOIO 3  photocatalysts by calcination method was proposed. Meanwhile, the effect of oxygen vacancies on the photocatalytic activity of BiOIO 3  photocatalysts was investigated. The BiOIO 3  photocatalysts with oxygen vacancies were found to be efficiently photocatalytically remove gaseous Hg 0  and the relative photocatalysis mechanism was investigated.",

The physicochemical property of the as-prepared defect TiO 2 /BiOIO 3  heterostructure was investigated by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS, FT-IR, BET, DRS, and PL characterization. The results indicated that introducing surface defect and forming interface heterostructure on photocatalysts at the same time can enhance the visible light response, promote the transfer velocity of the photocarriers and suppress the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, it exhibits an enhanced activity on photocatalytic oxidation of gas-phase elemental mercury (Hg\u00b0), which shows the highest Hg\u00b0 oxidation efficiency of 91.12% under visible light.",

        "abstract": "A one-pot synthetic approach to prepare self-assembled BiOI/BiOCl microflowers by a template-free coprecipitation method at room temperature has been developed. The physicochemical structure of BiOI/BiOCl microflowers were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution TEM (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The composition information and bonding energy structure of the BiOI/BiOCl microflowers were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) analysis and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared BiOI/BiOCl microflowers was tested through photocatalytic oxidation of gas-phase mercury, as a useful catalyst (or additive) in wet electrostatistic precipitator (WESP) to capture heavy metals including mercury. The results show that the prepared BiOI/BiOCl samples demonstrate higher photocatalytic efficiency than pure BiOI or BiOCl. By optimizing the component ratio of the BiOI and BiOCl, up to 72.2% oxidation efficiency can be achieved in BiOI/BiOCl microflowers. Finally, the photocatalytic influence of BiOI/BiOCl microflowers on gas-phase mercury oxidation had been proposed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Selectively exposing different facets of the photocatalysts to enhance the photocatalytic activity is a promising method. However, the role of exposed specific facets in a photocatalytic process is not fully understood. In order to clarify this mechanism, we have systemically explored the relationships between selectively exposed facets and photocatalytic activity of the nanoplate bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI). The BiOI was synthesized by pH-induced transformation method, and the photocatalytic activity was evaluated by photocatalytic oxidation of gas-phase mercury. The exposed specific facet ratios can be adjusted, and depend on the pH of the precursors. Our results showed that the BiOI with exposed (1\u202f1\u202f0) facets possesses an excellent photocatalytic oxidation activity on gas-phase mercury than the BiOI with exposed (0\u202f0\u202f1) facets. Characterization analysis indicated that the BiOI with exposed (1\u202f1\u202f0) facets can generate more superoxide radical (           \u00b7   O    2   -     ) than the BiOI with exposed (0\u202f0\u202f1) facets. Furthermore, both the BiOI with exposed (1\u202f1\u202f0) and (0\u202f0\u202f1) facets can not produce free hydroxyl groups (         \u00b7   OH    ) directly, but can generate it by transformation of the surface absorbance oxygen process. The BiOI with exposed (1\u202f1\u202f0) facets can generate more            \u00b7   O    2   -     , which accumulate on the conduction band of the BiOI and transform to          \u00b7   OH     by process of O 2 \u202f\u2192\u202f           \u00b7   O    2   -     \u202f\u2192\u202fH 2 O 2 \u202f\u2192\u202f         \u00b7   OH    . Thus, the BiOI with exposed (1\u202f1\u202f0) facets can produce more          \u00b7   OH     than the BiOI with exposed (0\u202f0\u202f1) facets as well. This finding may enhance the comprehension of the mechanism between the selectively exposed facets and the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples.",

In a classic paper, Rivest and Vuillemin [18] show that any non-constant monotone property P: {0,1} (2 n) \u2192 {0,1} of n-vertex graphs has D(P) = \u03a9 (n). We extend their result to 3-uniform hypergraphs. In particular, we show that any non-constant monotone property P: {0,1} (3 n) \u2192 {0,1} of n-vertex 3-uniform hypergraphs has D(P) = \u03a9 (n). Our proof combines the combinatorial approach of Rivest and Vuillemin with the topological approach of Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant. Interestingly, our proof makes use of Vinogradov's Theorem (weak Gold-bach Conjecture), inspired by its recent use by Babai et. al. [1] in the context of the topological approach. Our work leaves the generalization to k-uniform hypergraphs as an intriguing open question. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",

        "abstract": "In the 1970u0027s, Lovu0027asz built a bridge between graphs and alternating matrix spaces, in the context of perfect matchings (FCT 1979). A similar connection between bipartite graphs and matrix spaces plays a key role in the recent resolutions of the non-commutative rank problem (Garg-Gurvits-Oliveira-Wigderson, FOCS 2016; Ivanyos-Qiao-Subrahmanyam, ITCS 2017). In this paper, we lay the foundation for another bridge between graphs and alternating matrix spaces, in the context of independent sets and vertex colorings. The corresponding structures in alternating matrix spaces are isotropic spaces and isotropic decompositions, both useful structures in group theory and manifold theory. We first show that the maximum independent set problem and the vertex c-coloring problem reduce to the maximum isotropic space problem and the isotropic c-decomposition problem, respectively. Next, we show that several topics and results about independent sets and vertex colorings have natural correspondences for isotropic spaces and decompositions. These include algorithmic problems, such as the maximum independent set problem for bipartite graphs, and exact exponential-time algorithms for the chromatic number, as well as mathematical questions, such as the number of maximal independent sets, and the relation between the maximum degree and the chromatic number. These connections lead to new interactions between graph theory and algebra. Some results have concrete applications to group theory and manifold theory, and we initiate a variant of these structures in the context of quantum information theory. Finally, we propose several open questions for further exploration. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Ker-I Ko.",

        "abstract": "The weight decision problem, which requires to determine the Hamming weight of a given binary string, is a natural and important problem, with applications in cryptanalysis, coding theory, fault-tolerant circuit design and so on. In particular, both Deutsch-Jozsa problem and Grover search problem can be interpreted as special cases of weight decision problems. In this work, we investigate the exact quantum query complexity of weight decision problems, where the quantum algorithm must always output the correct answer.

The players win if and only if their answers satisfy both parity and consistency conditions. We completely characterize the maximum winning probabilities (game value) under classical, quantum and no-signalling strategies, respectively. In contrast to the original CHSH game designed to demonstrate the superiority of quantumness, we find that the quantum advantages in the Hypercube game significantly decrease as the number of players increase. Notably, the quantum value decays exponentially fast to the classical value as $m$ increases, while the no-signalling value always remains to be one.",

A completely randomized design involving a 1 (the non-injected control)\u2009+\u20091 (the injected control with sterilized water)\u2009+\u20092 (Zn source)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (Zn level) factorial arrangement of treatments was used. The two injected Zn sources were inorganic Zn sulfate and organic Zn-lysine chelate with a moderate chelation strength, and the two injected Zn levels were 50 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg Zn/egg. In ovo Zn injection decreased (P\u2009<\u00a00.05) embryonic mortality, and increased (P\u2009<\u00a00.05) hatchability and healthy chick ratio. In ovo Zn injection increased (P\u2009<\u00a00.05) embryonic tibia Zn content, but had no effect (P\u2009>\u00a00.05) on copper (Cu)- and Zn-containing superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) activities and metallothionein IV (MT4) levels or their mRNA expression levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the embryonic liver. In ovo Zn injection had no effect (P\u2009>\u00a00.05) on the global level of DNA methylation or DNA methylation and histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation levels of the MT4 promoter in the embryonic liver. However, the organic Zn had higher (P\u2009<\u00a00.05) levels of DNA methylation and H3K9 acetylation than inorganic Zn. These data demonstrate that in ovo Zn injection improved the embryonic development, and the organic Zn was more effective than inorganic Zn in enhancing DNA methylation and H3K9 acetylation in the liver MT4 promoter, but the precise mechanisms require further investigations.",

Experiment 1 was conducted to determine an optimal embryonic age for early  in ovo  injection. A total of 720 fertilized eggs with similar weights were randomly allotted to 4 treatments with 6 replicates per treatment and 30 eggs per replicate in a completely randomized design. The eggs were injected with 0.1 mL sterilized water at 3, 6 and 9 embryonic days of incubation (E3, E6 and E9) or non-injection (the control), respectively. The results from experiment 1 showed that E3 and E6 injections increased ( P  P  P u003e0.05) between E9 injection and the non-injected control were observed in either embryonic mortality or hatchability. The findings suggest that the E9 is the optimal embryonic age for early  in ovo  injection.

        "abstract": "Suspended sediment concentration SSC is one of the most critical parameters in water quality and environmental evaluations. Remote sensing has the potential for monitoring the dynamics and spatial distribution of SSC efficiently. The primary objective of this study is to develop retrieval models that are reliable and sensitive to SSC levels in the Caofeidian area, a new seaport in northeast China, based on Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper TM images and a set of in situ data sets, including spectral reflectance data and water quality data. The study finds that the band reflectance ratio and binary combination factor i.e. the ratio of the reflectance to the particle size are more effective than single band reflectance, and a non-linear model is more potent than a linear model for predicting SSC in the Caofeidian waters. A quadratic polynomial regression model of the RTM3/RTM2 ratio is proposed as the optimal retrieval model after evaluating various models with respect to different sensitive factors. The accuracy of the model is acceptable with a relative error and a root mean square error of 25.35% and 7.22 mg l\u20131, respectively; the correlation coefficient between the observed and estimated SSCs is 0.986. This study also indicates that the band reflectance ratio and binary combination factor are effective in weakening and even partially eliminating the effects of the changes in the sediment type i.e. particle size and refractive index. And the band reflectance ratio is more efficient. Using the proposed model and TM data, SSC levels for the entire region were estimated. Such results can serve as a baseline for future environmental monitoring efforts.",

The study of the article analyzed the Apparent Optical Properties(AOPs) and Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) of waters in the Caofeidian region, according to the water sample parameters collected from the field, spectral data gathered simultaneously and the coefficients for absorption a and backscattering bb of the waters calculated by Mie theory, Based on this, we developed the correlation analysis model between AOPs and IOPs of waters. Meanwhile, we analyzed the relationship of AOPs and IOPs on the single band corresponding to landsat5 and found the correlation between AOPs and IOPs in band3 was the best. The results of this study will be the basis for analyzing water characteristics and inversion water quality parameters by remote sensing in this area. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In this work we investigate into energy complexity, a Boolean function measure related to circuit complexity. Given a circuit $mathcal{C}$ over the standard basis ${vee_2,wedge_2,neg}$, the energy complexity of $mathcal{C}$, denoted by $mathrm{EC}(mathcal{C})$, is the maximum number of its activated inner gates over all inputs. The energy complexity of a Boolean function $f$, denoted by $mathrm{EC}(f)$, is the minimum of $mathrm{EC}(mathcal{C})$ over all circuits $mathcal{C}$ computing $f$. This concept has attracted lots of attention in literature. Recently, Denish, Otiv, and Sarma [COCOONu002718] gave $mathrm{EC}(f)$ an upper bound in terms of the decision tree complexity, $mathrm{EC}(f)=O(mathrm{D}(f)^3)$. They also showed that $mathrm{EC}(f)leq 3n-1$, where $n$ is the input size. Recall that the minimum size of circuit to compute $f$ could be as large as $2^n/n$. We improve their upper bounds by showing that $mathrm{EC}(f)leqmin{frac12mathrm{D}(f)^2+O(mathrm{D}(f)),n+2mathrm{D}(f)-2}$. For the lower bound, Denish, Otiv, and Sarma defined positive sensitivity, a complexity measure denoted by $mathrm{psens}(f)$, and showed that $mathrm{EC}(f)gefrac{1}{3}mathrm{psens}(f)$. They asked whether $mathrm{EC}(f)$ can also be lower bounded by a polynomial of $mathrm{D}(f)$. In this paper we affirm it by proving $mathrm{EC}(f)=Omega(sqrt{mathrm{D}(f)})$. For non-degenerated functions with input size $n$, we give another lower bound $mathrm{EC}(f)=Omega(log{n})$. All these three lower bounds are incomparable to each other. Besides, we also examine the energy complexity of $mathtt{OR}$ functions and $mathtt{ADDRESS}$ functions, which implies the tightness of our two lower bounds respectively. In addition, the former one answers another open question asking for a non-trivial lower bounds for the energy complexity of $mathtt{OR}$ functions.",
