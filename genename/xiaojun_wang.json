CNTs significantly refined the grains of Mg-6Zn matrix, and the CNTs evidently improved the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS) and Young's modulus. Grain refinement, load transfer mechanism and Orowan strengthening mechanism play important roles on the increase of the yield strength. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

In the as-cast composite, SiC particles were segregated along grain boundaries, which was like necklaces along the grain boundaries. Thus, particles aggregated at transgranular areas while particles were almost absent at the grain interiors. During hot compression, particle deformation zones (PDZs) were formed near particles due to the mismatch between SiC particles and Mg matrix. DRX preferentially started near particles due to \"particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN)\" in PDZs. Therefore, this necklace particle distribution caused initiation of DRX along the pre-existing (initial) grain boundaries. As a result, the initial grain boundaries were entirely covered by new and fine DRX grains, and necklace structure of DRX grains was formed along the grain boundaries. As DRX further proceeded, DRX extended from the intergranular areas of the initial grains to the initial grain interiors. According to the microstructure investigations and analysis, the necklace mechanism for DRX was established for Mg matrix composites with necklace particle distribution. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

Microstructure evolution of bimodal size SiCp/AZ91 composite during room temperature tensile process was investigated using transmission electron microscopy. Results illustrate that the dislocations pile up around bimodal size particles while the twinning is formed away from micron particles. Compared with submicron particles, larger stress concentration is occurred easily at the end of micron particles, thus results in the appearance of microcracks. However, the interface bonding between submicron SiCp and magnesium matrix is very well, and no microcracks are found around submicron particles. It is thought that the existence of submicron SiCp is propitious to hinder the propagation of microcracks, which contributes to the increased strength of magnesium. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

After be forged at 420\u00b0C with 50% reduction initially, the composite is subjected to extrusion at 370\u00b0C with the ratio of 16. Results illustrates that the combination of forging and extrusion process has significant effect on refining grain size and improving particle distribution, which results in the obvious improvement of ambient tensile strength. Tensile testing at elevated temperatures also has been performed on the as-extruded composites at temperatures from 593K to 643K with initial strain rates from 8.3\u00d710 -4 to 1.67\u00d710 -2s -1. It demonstrates that the composite exhibits higher plasticity at elevated temperatures, which is mainly attributed to significant grain refinement and uniform particle distribution after hot deformation. Besides, the shape of stress-strain curves of submicron-SiCp/AZ91composite depends very sensitively on the strain rate and testing temperature. The strain-rate sensitivity exponent m is about 0.4 in the temperature and strain-rate range investigated, which suggests that the deformation probably occurred through grain boundary sliding accommodated by diffusional transport. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The distribution of CNTs in the composites depends on the solidification rate. When the solidification rate was low, CNTs were pushed ahead of the solidification front and will cluster along grain boundaries. When the solidification rate was high, CNTs were captured by the solidification front, so the CNTs remained inside the grain. Moreover, good interfacial bonding was achieved in the composite under high solidification rate. Meanwhile, compared with the matrix alloy, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) of the composite were significantly improved. The mechanical properties of the composite under higher solidification rate are better than composite under low solidification rate and the alloy. Moreover, most CNTs on the fracture surfaces were directly pulled out from the matrix. The Kelly-Tyson formula agreed well with the experimental tensile value in the composite under higher solidification rate, and the load-transfer efficiency is almost equal to 1. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In this study, SiC nanoparticles were added into matrix alloy through a combination of semisolid stirring and ultrasonic vibration while dynamic precipitation of second phases was obtained through multi-pass forging with varying temperatures. During single-pass forging of the present composite, as the deformation temperature increased, the extent of recrystallization increased, and grains were refined due to the inhibition effect of the increasing amount of dispersed SiC nanoparticles. A small amount of twins within the SiC nanoparticle dense zone could be found while the precipitated phases of MgAl in long strips and deformation bands with high density dislocations were formed in the particle sparse zone after single-pass forging at 350 \u00b0C. This indicated that the particle sparse zone was mainly deformed by dislocation slip while the nanoparticle dense zone may have been deformed by twinning. The yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the composites were gradually enhanced through increasing the single-pass forging temperature from 300 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C, which demonstrated that initial high forging temperature contributed to the improvement of the mechanical properties. During multi-pass forging with varying temperatures, the grain size of the composite was gradually decreased while the grain size distribution tended to be uniform with reducing the deformation temperature and extending the forging passes. In addition, the amount of precipitated second phases was significantly increased compared with that after multi-pass forging under a constant temperature. The improvement in the yield strength of the developed composite was related to grain refinement strengthening and Orowan strengthening resulting from synergistical effect of the externally applied SiC nanoparticles and internally precipitated second phases.",

Then the as-cast ingots were deformed by the combination of forging and extrusion process. Typical microstructures were obtained in the composites reinforced by different particle sizes. For the composites with lower volume fraction of particles (2%), submicron SiCp had significant influence on grain refinement and strengthening effect, which resulted in better mechanical properties of submicron SiCp/AZ91 composite. However, mechanical properties reduced owing to the obvious agglomerated submicron SiC particles as the volume fraction increased to 5% and 10%. On the contrary, for micron SiCp/AZ91 composite, the grain size was refined and the strengthening effect was enhanced with the increasing of volume fraction. Although particle size has no influence on the texture type, it has different effects on weakening the intensity of texture. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V..",

Unlike traditional stir casting, short semi-solid stir time was needed for addition and pre-dispersion of the particles in the novel processing. For ultrasonic treatment, there existed an optimal time. Both too short and too long time for the treatment resulted in nonhomogeneous particle distribution. Furthermore, the liquid stirring after ultrasonic treatment was proved to be necessary to further improve particle distribution. The mechanical properties of the composites fabricated by different parameters indicated that ultrasonic treatment evidently improved the mechanical properties compared with traditional stir casting. 5-20% SiCp/AZ91 composites were fabricated by the novel processing. The particle distribution was uniform in these composites. The grains were refined by addition of SiC particles. Grain sizes of composites decreased with the increases of particle contents. The ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elastic modulus were enhanced as the particle contents increased. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

The results showed, that the degree of grain size refinement for pure Mg was limited after 2 passes, because of a relatively high processing temperature. Two different types of Mg 2 Si were obtained: firstly, relatively coarse polygonal Mg 2 Si grains and secondly, the Chinese type eutectic mixture of Mg with Mg 2Si. These hard particles of Mg 2 Si have an high influence on the development of texture and microstructure during ECAP. A kind of basal-plane-type texture was formed for both materials, where the (0002) pole figure showed a strong orientation maximum, normal to the deformation plane. The misfits from the ideal 45\u00b0 tilting angle related to the 90\u00b0 die geometry come from the construction details of the ECAP device. The monoclinic deformation symmetry by shearing was not reached because of friction, which resulted in a simple rotation along the ECAP-direction.",

Extrusion of the SiCp/AZ91 nanocomposite induced large scale dynamic recrystallization resulting in a fine matrix microstructure. There were two kinds of zones in the extruded nanocomposite: SiC nanoparticle bands parallel to the extrusion direction and refined-grain zones between the SiC nanoparticle bands. In the SiC nanoparticle bands, there were SiC nanoparticles along the boundaries of refined grains. The distribution of SiC nanoparticles was uniform although some agglomerates of SiC nanoparticles still existed in the SiC nanoparticle bands. The ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation to fracture of the SiCp/AZ91 nanocomposite were simultaneously improved by extrusion. Results from the extruded SiCp/AZ91 nanocomposite tensile testing at different temperatures (75, 125, 175 and 225 \u00b0C) revealed an increase of the tensile strength and ductility values compared with the unreinforced and extruded AZ91 alloy. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

The influence of fine (<1. \u03bcm) particles on the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) behavior of AZ91 matrix was investigated by researching the microstructure evolution of 0.2. \u03bcm 1. vol% SiCp/AZ91 composite during the hot extrusion process. Results showed that the DRXed ratio of AZ91 matrix increased as well as the average size of DRXed grains reduced due to the addition of fine particles. The SiCp could not only pin dislocation, but also was helpful to generate dislocations owing to the deformation mismatch between matrix and particles, thus causing the increase of dislocation density around SiCp, which was benefit to stimulate DRX nucleation. Meanwhile, the growth of DRXed grains was suppressed in the following deformation process due to the pinning effect of fine particles on grain boundaries. Thus, the fine particles had significant effect on stimulating DRXed nucleation and refining grain size. The yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the as-deformed 0.2. \u03bcm 1. vol% SiCp/AZ91 composite are 275 and 335.

After hot deformation process, the influence of bimodal size particles on microstructures and mechanical properties of AZ91 matrix was investigated by comparing with monolithic A91 alloy, submicron SiCp/AZ91 and micron SiCp/AZ91 composites. The results show that micron particles can stimulate dynamic recrystallized nucleation, while submicron particles may pin grain boundaries during the hot deformation process, which results in a significant grain refinement of AZ91 matrix. Compared to submicron particles, micron particles are more conducive to grain refinement through stimulating the dynamic recrystallized nucleation. Besides, the yield strength of bimodal size SiCp/AZ91 composite is higher than that of single-size particle reinforced composites. Among the strengthening mechanisms of bimodal size particle reinforced composite, it is found that grain refinement and dislocation strengthening mechanism play a larger role on improving the yield strength. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

        "title": "Microstructure and mechanical properties of SiCp/AZ91 composite deformed through a combination of forging and extrusion process",
        "abstract": "In this paper, 10 vol.% SiCp/AZ91 magnesium matrix composites were fabricated by stir casting technology. The as-cast ingots were forged at 420 \u00b0C with 50% reduction, and then extruded at 370 \u00b0C with the ratio of 16 at a constant ram speed of 15 mm/s. The results showed that the grains were refined during forging. A much finer grain size (\u223c2.7 \u03bcm) of composite matrix was obtained by subjecting the as-forged composite to hot extrusion. The fine SiC particulates restricted the dynamic recrystallized grain growth during the hot extrusion processing, resulting in a remarkable grain refinement. The yield stress and ultimate tensile stress were increased in the as-extruded composite, with the reasons of eliminated casting flaws, the uniform particle distribution and grains refinement. The grain refinement and uniform particle distribution caused an obvious increase in work hardening rate in the as-extruded composite during tensile deformation at room temperature. 1 Introduction Magnesium matrix composites (MMCs) are advanced materials providing properties which are superior to monolithic magnesium alloys, such as high specific strength, high specific modulus, low coefficient of thermal expansion and good wear resistance [1\u20133] . The development of these materials starts with the production of continuous-fibre-reinforced composites. The high cost and difficulty of processing these composites restrict their applications and lead to the development of discontinuously reinforced composites [4,5] . Among the manufacturing processes for discontinuous MMCs, stir casting is widely used for its simplicity, low cost and capability in producing complex shapes at a high production rate [6\u20138] . Even though the casting methods are simple and economical, the application of as-cast magnesium matrix composites is restricted due to their low mechanical properties caused by micro-voids formed in the matrix during stir casting. So it is necessary to improve the mechanical properties of the as-cast composites by second processing, such as rolling, extrusion or forging. Some studies demonstrate that forging and extrusion can minimize or eliminate porosity, lead to a more uniform particle distribution and also improve the particle\u2013matrix interfacial bonding, with a subsequent increase in strength and ductility [9\u201312] . Deng et al. [13] investigate the effect of forging temperatures on the evolution of the matrix microstructures, textures and mechanical properties of the SiCp/AZ91 magnesium matrix composites. Wang et al. [14,15] find that hot extrusion can improve the distribution uniformity of the particles in the matrix and enhance the mechanical properties of magnesium matrix composites. Two-step processing route has a significant effect on reducing grain size and improving the mechanical properties of magnesium. El-Morsy et al. [16] obtain the finer grain size and improved tensile properties of AZ61 magnesium alloy processed by a combination of hot extrusion and thermomechanical processing. Matsubara et al. [17] apply the extrusion and equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) to a cast Mg-9% Al alloy, and the grain size is reduced from 50 \u03bcm in the cast alloy to 12 \u03bcm after extrusion and 0.7 \u03bcm after extrusion and ECAP. For particle reinforced magnesium matrix composites, however, most of papers focus on the effect of forging or extrusion on the composites, respectively. While relatively few, not conclusive, results are reported in the literature on the effect of using a two-step processing route in which the composite is initially forged and then subjected to extrusion. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of two-step processing route on microstructure and mechanical properties of 10 vol.% SiCp/AZ91 magnesium matrix composites. In particular, it is hoped to obtain the composites with finer grain size, the uniform reinforcing particle distribution, good particle\u2013matrix interfacial bonding, as well as the improved mechanical properties. 2 Experimental procedure The material used in this work is SiC (10 vol.%) ceramic particles reinforced AZ91D composites fabricated by stir casting. The average diameter of the SiC particles is about 5 \u03bcm. The chemical composition (wt.%) of the AZ91D magnesium alloy is as follows: Al-9.3, Zn-0.7, Mn-0.23, Si-0.02, Cu-0.001, Ni-0.001, Fe-0.002, Be-0.0015 and Mg-balance. AZ91D alloy was molten at 720 \u00b0C, and then cooled to 590 \u00b0C, at which the matrix alloy was in the semi-solid condition. The 600 \u00b0C preheated SiC particles were quickly added into the semi-solid matrix alloy, and then stirred at a constant rate. After the incorporation was finished, the melt was heated up to 720 \u00b0C and then cast into a 450 \u00b0C preheated iron die. The melt was solidifying with a pressure of 100 MPa to reduce porosity. Cylindrical ingot with 57 mm in diameter and 40 mm in height was machined from the composite ingot, which confirm to the 50% reduction on height [13] . Before forging, the ingot was treated at 380 \u00b0C for 2 h and 415 \u00b0C for 24 h (T4 treatment). A graphite-based mixture was used as a high temperature lubricant to reduce friction. The forging process was conducted at a constant RAM speed of 15 mm/s at the temperature of 420 \u00b0C with with 50% reduction. Subsequently, the as-forged composite (denote: FD) was extruded at 370 \u00b0C with the ratio of 16 (denote: FD-ED). Microstructure observation was carried out by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The specimens for OM were ground, polished and etched in acetic picral [5 ml acetic acid + 6 g picric acid + 10 ml H 2 O + 100 ml ethanol (95%)]. The average grain size was measured using the linear intercept method. Specimens for SEM were ground and polished with much care in order to avoid causing particle damage in this stage. The tensile specimens of as FDed composite were cut perpendicular to forging direction, and of as FD-EDed composite were cut parallel to extrusion direction. The tensile test was carried out on an Instron Series 5569 test machine at tensile rate of 0.5 mm/min at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Microstructures Fig. 1 shows the optical microstructure of the SiCp/AZ91 magnesium matrix composites before and after deformation. The SiC particles are mainly distributed along grain boundaries in the as-cast composite, as shown in Fig. 1 a. Compared with as-cast composite, the grain size is refined obviously after forging, as shown in Fig. 1 b, and the as-forged composite exhibits fine equiaxed grains with well-defined grain boundaries, suggesting that dynamic recrystallization took place during the forging processing. The average grain size of the as-forged composite is measured as about 9 \u03bcm, as shown in Table 1 . The matrix exhibits almost homogeneous finer microstructure after the subsequent extrusion process, as shown in Fig. 1 c, the grains are substantially refined, and become less resolved to the optical microscope. The average grain size of the as-extruded composite is reduced to about 2.7 \u03bcm, as shown in Table 1 . After the forging process, the grain sizes near the particles are smaller than that away from the particles, as shown in Fig. 1 b, which indicates that dynamic recrystallization in the SiCp/AZ91 composite is sensitive to the particles in this composite [13] . The matrix exhibits much more homogeneous after the subsequent extrusion process. The obvious grain refinement of SiCp/AZ91 composites can be attributed to two reasons: on one hand, the application of the combination of forging and extrusion has significant effect on refining grain size; on the other hand, the added SiC particles may stimulate nucleation at the early stage of deformation and then restrict the grain growth during the deformation process [15] . 3.2 Particle distribution of the composite Fig. 2 shows the SEM micrographs of the particle distribution in SiCp/AZ91 composite before and after hot deformation. The particles are segregated within the intergranular regions in the as-cast composite, as shown in Fig. 2 a. It could be explained that most of the SiC particles are pushed ahead by liquid\u2013solid interface during solidification [18] . When impingement with another growing grains, these particles are segregated in the intergranular regions [19] . The SiC particle clusters which are initially present in some areas in the as-cast composite disappear in the as-forged composite, as shown in Fig. 2 b, which means that the particle distribution condition in SiCp/AZ91 composite is improved by the application of forging. After extrusion, a much more uniform particulate distribution is obtained in the as-extruded composite, as shown in Fig. 2 c. 3.3 Mechanical properties Tensile properties of SiCp/AZ91 composite before and after hot deformation are presented in Table 2 . The cast SiCp/AZ91 composite provides 200 MPa yield strength (YS) and 207 MPa ultimate strength (UTS) while after forging process the yield strength and ultimate strength increases up to 243 MPa and 282 MPa, respectively. The increase is due to grain refinement ( Fig. 1 b) and the improved particulate distribution ( Fig. 2 b). After the subsequent extrusion process, the mechanical properties are improved significantly. The yield strength and ultimate strength increased to 292 MPa and 389 MPa, respectively. And the elongation is also increased from 0.67% to 2.05%. After forging and subsequent extrusion process, the grains are refined and the particulate distribution condition is improved gradually, compared to the as-cast condition, which lead to the significant improvement of the mechanical properties of SiCp/AZ91 composite. Some studies demonstrate that the strength and ductility of the particulate containing composites are greatly improved by the reason of the uniform reinforcement distribution [13,14] . On the other hand, the yield stress of the Mg alloys with hexagonal close packed structure is thought to be dependent on grain size [20] . In general, the yield strength of polycrystalline materials obeys the Hall\u2013Petch relation. (1) \u03c3 y = \u03c3 0 + kd - 1 / 2 where d is the grain diameter, \u03c3 0 and k are experimentally derived constants. The yield strength increases with the decreasing of grain size. Besides, the improved particle\u2013matrix interfacial bonding and minimal porosity obtained after the two-step process are also the contribution to the improvement of mechanical properties [9,21,22] . 3.4 Fracture observation The fracture surface of SiCp/AZ91 composites at different deformation process is shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 a and c show the brittle fracture of the composites with flat fracture surface. Fig. 3 b and d reveal that there are some plastic pits originated from the small SiC particles being pulled out from the AZ91 matrix after plastic deformation. The microcracks which are initiated in the SiC/AZ91 matrix interface and propagated in the AZ91 matrix, generate the pulling-out of SiC particles [23] . However, small dimples are also found in the AZ91 matrix, as shown in Fig. 3 b and d. The presence of dimples displays the typical ductile fracture of the matrix alloy. The size of dimples in the matrix of as FD-EDed condition is much smaller, as well as the amount is lager than that of in the as-forged condition, which indicates that the plastic of the SiCp/AZ91 composite is improved by subject the extrusion process to the as-forged composite. Fig. 3 d shows that the smaller dimples also exist at the SiCp\u2013AZ91 matrix interface, which reveals the good interface bonding between matrix and particulates. The observations suggest that the subsequent extrusion process may have beneficial effects on the interfacial bonding [22] . 3.5 Work hardening behavior Work hardening behavior of composites can be described by means of macroscopic work hardening rate: (2) \u03b8 = d \u03c3 d \u03b5 where \u03c3 and \u03b5 is the macroscopic true stress and true strain, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the work hardening rate of the SiCp/AZ91 composites at different deformation conditions (FDed and FD-EDed). The yield stress \u03c3 0.2 is subtracted from \u03c3 , and \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 0.2 is related to the dislocation contribution to the flow stress [24] . Both the two curves decrease linearly with increasing \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 0.2 , which is very similar to the stage III of work hardening in fcc polycrystals. Similar behavior has been observed in as-rolled AM60 Mg alloys [25] . The deformation at yielding occurs by basal slip in the two types of processed samples of the SiCp/AZ91 composites. The stage III of work hardening is closely related to multiple slip. This occurs in magnesium can be considered to the operation of prismatic slip, in addition to basal slip, as deformation proceeds [24,25] . Compared to two curves, the work hardening rate of as FD-EDed condition is higher than that of as-forged composite. As mentioned above, the grain size of SiCp/AZ91 composite matrix is refined from 9 \u03bcm to 2.7 \u03bcm after extrusion process and the SiC particles are distributed much more uniformly in the matrix of as FD-EDed condition. The two reasons may contributed to the higher work hardening rate of as FD-EDed SiCp/AZ91 composite, which indicates the enhanced ability of plastic deformation of the composite after the FD-EDed process. 4 Conclusions In this study, SiCp/AZ91 magnesium matrix composites fabricated by stir casting were processed by a combination of hot forging and extrusion. The effects of two-step processing on the microstructure and mechanical properties were studied and the main conclusions of this study could be summarized as follows: 1. A finer grain size was achieved in SiCp/AZ91 magnesium matrix composites by using a combination of hot forging and extrusion. This combination led to grain refinement and produced an average grain size of about 2.7 \u03bcm. 2. The SiC particles were mainly distributed along the grain boundaries in the as-cast composites. The segregation of particles was largely eliminated and much more uniform particle distribution was obtained by the application of two-steps processing. 3. By the application of two-steps processing, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of SiCp/AZ91 composite were improved obviously. 4. The fracture observation revealed brittle fracture of the composites. The size of dimples in the matrix of was smaller, and the amount was lager after two-steps processing, which indicated that the plastic of the SiCp/AZ91 composite was improved by subject the extrusion process to the as-forged composite. 5. The work hardening rate decreased linearly with increasing \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 0.2 . The grain refinement and much more uniform particle distribution caused an obvious increase in work hardening rate in the as-extruded composite compared to that of as-forged composite during tensile deformation at room temperature.

Most of the SiC nanoparticles exhibited a homogeneous distribution in the 0.5 and 1vol.% SiCp/AZ91 nanocomposites. The ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation to fracture of the 0.5 and 1vol.% SiCp/AZ91 nanocomposites were simultaneously improved.

The pure magnesium alloys include CPM1 and CPM2 castings having textures of columnar grains which extraordinarily influence the damping behaviours. The commercial pure magnesium alloy CPM was re-melted to obtain equiaxed grains, which could remove the effect of texture orientation on the damping behaviours of these pure magnesium alloys. The results of strain amplitude-dependent damping spectrums of these pure magnesium alloys show that the pure magnesium with equiaxed grains possesses the highest damping capacity. In temperature-dependent damping plot for all these three pure magnesium alloys, there are two damping peaks P 1 and P 2 located at 80 and 230 \u00b0C, respectively. These two damping peaks are considered to be caused by the interaction between dislocation and point defects, and the movement of grain boundaries, respectively.",

The addition of SiC nanoparticles can strongly inhibit the formation of shear bands, which are much more prevalent in matrix alloy sheets. Compared with pristine AZ31 alloy, the nanocomposite is characterized by a lamellar structure which is composed by the alternative a fine grain layer and a coarse grain layer. The lamellar structure was caused by the nanoparticle bands in as-rolled sheet. The fine grain layer was caused by the pinning effects of nanoparticles on recrystallized grain growth. Moreover, nanoparticles complicatedly altered the basal texture intensities of the matrix in the nanocomposite, instead of the reported simply weakening effect. For the mechanical strengths, the hot rolling leads to remarkable enhancement for both of nanocomposite and alloy sheets. However, the former ones always show superior value than the latter ones. Inhibited shear bands, nanoparticles bands and the associated lamellar structure do benefit the stronger mechanical properties in the nanocomposite sheets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Metal/reinforcement nanolayered composites can effectively balance the strength and toughness. However, the difficulty of inserting nanoscaled metal layers restricts their practical application. In this study, laminated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) reinforced Cu composites with microscaled metal layered were fabricated by a feasible method and exhibited simultaneously enhanced strength and toughness. CNTs were deposited on Cu foils by electrophoretic deposition with two-dimensional homogeneous dispersion. Insertion of CNTs induced the laminated Cu composite with repeated layer spacing of \u223c20\u202f\u03bcm through hot pressing and hot rolling. Simultaneously enhanced yield strength (183\u202fMPa) and elongation (30.9%) were obtained with only 0.067\u202fvol% CNTs. The strength improvement reached far beyond the mixture rule in metal matrix composites (MMCs) with homogeneous CNTs dispersion. CNTs and the induced interfaces serve as effective dislocations motion barriers and strengthen the composite. Laminated composite exhibited more stable deformation due to suppressed strain location by the layered structure. This work highlights the strengthening and toughening effects of laminated structure induced by CNTs, and provides a feasible method to build the laminated MMCs with adjustable metal layer thickness and CNTs amount, thus breaking the dimensional limit of metal layers in the design of laminated MMCs with enhanced mechanical properties.",

In this work, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) reinforced magnesium laminated composites were fabricated. The composites with 0.25\u202fvol% and 0.75\u202fvol% GNPs exhibit tensile strength of 160\u202fMPa and 179\u202fMPa, respectively (136\u202fMPa for pure Mg). Homogeneously dispersed GNPs promotes the load transfer capacity and constrains the transformation of Mg foils to monolithic materials. The induced laminated structure prohibits the dislocation motion and strengthens the composites. The prolonged crack pathway by laminated structure also maintains the elongation to an appreciable level.",

CNTs were uniformly dispersed on Cu foils through electrophoresis deposition and embedded into the Cu matrix after hot pressing and rolling. Nanoscale CNTs/Cu composite layers were formed and a bimodal structure was induced. Introduction of CNTs and the induced laminated structure promote the enhancement in yield strength of \u223c31 and \u223c51\u202fMPa in composites with original 100 and 30\u202f\u03bcm Cu foils. More composite layers introduced by adopting 30\u202f\u03bcm Cu foils inhibited the rapid concentrated plastic deformation and prolonged the crack pathway, thus realizing the strength-ductility combination. The deteriorated ductility of Cu layers in composite with original 100\u202f\u03bcm Cu foils finally leaded to damaged ductility of the composite. This work provides a feasible way to construct the laminated composites and demonstrates the effect of structural parameters on strength-ductility combination.",

Nanocomposite sheets exhibited significantly enhanced tensile strength with respect to as-annealed extruded sheet. 50% strength improvement and relatively high ductility were realized in the sheet after 4 passes rolling, which resulted from the complicated interaction of the uniform microstructure, the fine mean grain size of 5.2\u00a0\u00b5m, the strong basal texture and the continuous nanoparticle bands. Additionally, strength along rolling direction and transverse direction in this sheet showed slight variation. Comparison with previous work showed that the 4-pass hot rolled sheet we obtained here with pre-extrusion exhibited the comparable mechanical strength and much better ductility, demonstrating that pre-extrusion can promote the deformation efficiency of hot rolling in magnesium nanocomposite sheets fabrication and achieve good combination of reasonable strength and remarkable ductility. Correlation of the mechanical performance with texture and microstructure evolution was investigated.",

This method was called liquid state settling technique in which TC4 particles would settle down under the force of gravity. High volume fraction (50%) particle reinforced AZ91 composites could be easily obtained via this novel method. This is difficult to achieve for other traditional liquid fabrication methods. In addition, there was a good dispersion of TC4 particles in the AZ91 matrix and no clusters were found, which indicate that this method was feasible. Interfacial reaction occurred and the reaction product was confirmed to be Al 2 Ti. Three kinds of pre-dispersion technologies were used before the settling process and different interfacial microstructures were found. Theoretical calculation and experimental results both indicated that the interfacial product which was embedded in the matrix strengthened the composites and improved the tensile strength.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Magnesium (Mg) is the lightest metal structural material but exhibits low toughness. By imitating the structure of nacre, constructing micro-nano layered structure is an effective way to balance strength and toughness. The micro-nano layered structure is constructed by electrophoretic depositing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on Mg foils. The CNTs layers embedded into 50\u202f\u03bcm\u202fMg foils exhibit a strengthening efficiency of 500 while increasing the toughness of the composites. Experiments and theoretical calculation results reveal that the high back stress induced by CNTs layers is an important strengthening mechanism. The significantly improved toughness derives from the increase in energy required for crack propagation and high Schmid factor for the basal slip system {0\u202f0\u202f0\u202f1} \u30081\u202f1\u202f     2    \u00af     \u202f0\u3009.

        "abstract": "Selective growth of oxidation coating was observed on Mg alloy AZ91D when this alloy was treated by microarc oxidation(MAO) technique, and then the role of intermetallic phase Mg17 Al12(b phase) during MAO was investigated. Corrosion resistance and anti-corrosion mechanism of the MAO coating were also studied. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) were used to characterize b phase and coating microstructure. Corrosion properties of the coated alloy were studied by potentiodynamic polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) in 3.5% NaCl solution. Results showed that sparking discharge preferentially occurred on a-Mg phase rather than on b phase at the early stage of MAO; however selective growth of the coating disappeared gradually with the increasing oxidation time and b phase would not further inhibit coating growth at the prolonged stage of MAO. Mg17 Al12 phase ultimately was unable to destroy the integrity and continuity of MAO coating. The MAO coating could restrain charge transfer process and then greatly enhance corrosion resistance of AZ91D alloy. Sealing treatment of MAO coating by stearic acid could further improve the corrosion resistance of AZ91D alloy.",

        "abstract": "A novel method was developed to fabricate carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-reinforced Mg matrix composites. The method consists of two steps: CNTs pre-dispersion by ball-milling and the ultrasonic melt processing. Mechanical ball-milling effectively pre-dispersed CNTs on Zn flakes with suitable rotational speed and ball-milling time. Serious CNT entanglements were dispersed by the ball-milling. However, ball-milling for a long time at high speed would damage the morphology of CNTs. The ultrasonic overcame the poor wettability between Mg melt and CNTs and then dispersed pre-dispersed CNTs in the Mg melt. CNTs were distributed well in the composites and maintained integrated structure. CNTs significantly improved the mechanical properties of the matrix. The strengthening efficiency reached to 37.1, which proves the superiority of this novel method. Besides grain refinement, load transfer may make a great contribution to the improvement of the strength for the composites.",

The approach consists of pre-dispersion and ultrasonic vibration. Homogeneous and single CNTs on flake Zn powder can be achieved simply by slurry blending. The pre-dispersed CNTs were added to Mg melt, and then, the melt was ultrasonically processed. After ultrasonic vibration, the CNTs/Mg\u20136Zn melt was cast into a metal mold. Most CNTs distribute homogeneously and singly in the bulk composites. Moreover, good interfacial bonding is achieved, and Raman spectroscopy analysis shows that the damage to CNTs is insignificant. Meanwhile, CNTs evidently improve the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation. The Kelly\u2013Tyson formula agrees well with the experimental tensile value, and the load-transfer efficiency is nearly equal to 1.",

        "abstract": "Co-Al-W superalloy is strengthened by a ternary compound \u03b3'-Co3(Al, W) phase with the precipitation strengthening on \u03b3-Co matrix of novel Co-base superalloys. In order to research the welding performance of Co-9Al-7.5W (mole fraction, %) superalloy on the 304 stainless steel by TIG cladding, and the friction coefficient of Co-9Al-7.5W cladding layer superalloy mated with SiN ring was investigated by THT07-135 type friction and wear tester and SEM, which compare with cobalt-based Stellite 6 resistant alloy at the same conditions. The results show that TIG welding Co-9Al-7.5W superalloy optimum parameters are that the welding current is 100 A, welding voltage is 12 V, heat input is 10.3 kJ/cm, the surface hardness of 7.5W cladding layer superalloy reaches HRC53.1. The wear mass loss of 7.5W cladding layer superalloy increases with increasing wear time. The wear mass loss of 7.5W cladding layer is slightly larger than that of Stellite 6 alloy, but the friction coefficient of 7.5W cladding layer is obviously smaller than that of Stellite 6 alloy. The average friction coefficient of 7.5W cladding layer is 0.471. But the friction coefficient of Stellite 6 alloy is 0.531. The wear resistance of 7.5W cladding layer is better than that of Stellite 6 alloy. The 7.5W cladding layer is mainly oxidation and abrasive wear, but Stellite 6 alloy mainly occur delamination and abrasive wear.",

The kinetic data of oxidation mass gain were measured for the Co-Al-W alloy at 800 and 900 oC in air, and the oxidation rate constants at different temperatures were determined by the relevant linear fitting. According to Arrhenius relation of the oxidation rate constants, the activation energy of oxidation was derived for this alloy at 800 and 900 oC. It is found that 9W alloy has the highest value of activation energy of oxidation among 7.5W, 9W and 10.7W at different temperatures. The addition of refractory elements Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti can change the mass gain and activation energy of oxidation of the Co-Al-W alloy; therefore, the oxidation resistance of the superalloy at high temperatures can be forecast.",

The effect of alloying element Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti on friction and wear performance of Co-Al-W superalloys at room temperature was studied by THT07-135 type friction and wear tester and SEM, and cobalt-based Stellite 6 alloy was employed for comparison. Results show that the friction coefficient of 9.8 W superalloy is smaller than that of cobalt-based Stellite 6. Alloying elements Mo, Nb and Ti can moderately reduce wear mass loss and friction coefficient of 9.8 W superalloy, and improve the wear resistance. The Mo, Ti and Nb elements can clearly improve the wear resistance of 9.8 W superalloy while the effect of Ta element is not obvious. The wear mechanism of Co-Al-W superalloy is mainly oxidation and abrasive wear, while that of Stellite 6 alloy mainly is delamination and abrasive wear.

The load value of upper bound solution is greater than that of theoretical solution at first, but with the increase of the amount of rigid blocks, it decreases and approaches the theoretical load. The shape of polygons combined by several triangle blocks approaches the shape of the central fan shape of the slip line field.

In order to study the reasons of these phenomena,a method of metallographic observation in combination with sample electrolysis was used to characterize the non-metallic inclusions in the alloy wire. The results indicate that the inclusions in the alloy are oxidation products during the process of melting. There are single or complex phase inclusions composed of elements such as Al,Si,Ca,Ti,Fe,and O2. Among them,the macro-inclusions are TiO2 compound inclusions formed by the adhesion of Al and Si oxides on them. These inclusions are fragile ones with a low strain rate,as well as a rather high hardness,so that they are the main reason that leads to the surface cracks and ruptures in the alloy wires. The analysis has educed that the key point to enhance the product quality is to promote the cleanliness of the melt,control the types and quantity of non-metal inclusions in the alloy.",

The structure and glass forming ability of the alloys were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA), respectively. It is shown that all of the Mg65Cu25Y10-xTbx (x=0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) alloys can be prepared into bulk amorphous alloys, the glass forming ability of the alloys becomes stronger with the increment of Tb content. It is the strongest when x=8 then drops at x=10, which can be explained reasonably by calculating the electro-negativity difference ?x and the atomic size parameter for the alloys. The single smooth melting peak in the DTA pattern indicates that the alloys with a stronger glass forming ability may be eutectic composition when x=6 and 8. The atomic structure parameter \u03bb of the two amorphous alloys is far from 0.18, which is deduced from the atom cluster model.",

        "abstract": "Radiation therapy is considered to be a treatment for keloid scarring; however, radioresistance has been shown to be a serious impediment to treatment efficacy. There is therefore a need for the discovery of novel critical molecular targets whose inhibition might enhance the radiotherapeutic response. An elevated level of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 expression after radiation therapy in keloid fibroblasts has been demonstrated in our recent experiments. Therefore, we suggested there was a possible close relationship between HIF-1\u03b1 and keloid radioresistance. The current study aimed to investigate whether target HIF-1\u03b1 may enhance the radiotherapeutic efficacy of keloids.2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) was applied to inhibit HIF-1\u03b1 expression, and the treatment results were assessed by cell proliferation, apoptosis and radiosensitivity. A lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNA (siRNA) transduction method was used to block the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 gene.Both mRNA and protein levels can be effectively inhibited after the knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1, leading to a significant increase of radiation-induced apoptosis in keloid fibroblasts. Our experiment also demonstrated that 2ME2 could effectively inhibit the protein expression of HIF-1\u03b1, which significantly increased the late stage of radiation-induced apoptosis of keloid fibroblasts.The present study indicates that HIF-1\u03b1 might serve as a therapeutic target for keloids. Furthermore, suppression of HIF-1\u03b1 by 2ME2 may be a promising therapeutic adjuvant in radiation therapy for keloids.",

The largest size of the nevus on the upper and lower eyelid were 2.5 cm x 2.0 cm and 4.0 cm x 3.0 cm, respectively. One postauricular SMAS-pedicled flap and 1 reversal superficial temporal artery flap showed distal venous refluence obstruction and epidermal necrosis in early postoperative stage, which healed through dressing.

The mean age was 42 years (range, 33-65 years). Of them, 10 patients underwent breast reconstruction with the DIEP flaps, and 1 patient received defect repair for chronic thoracic wall irradiated ulcer with the DIEP flap. The size of the flap ranged from 18 cm x 9 cm to 28 cm x 12 cm. Rib-sparing technique was applied in all these cases. The internal mammary vessels were exposed by dissection intercostal space and anastomosed with the deep inferior epigastric vessels. The donor sites were closed directly in all cases.In all cases, the rib-sparing technique for internal mammary vessels exposure and anastomosis was successfully performed. The mean time for internal mammary vessels exposure was 52 minutes (range, 38-65 minutes). The mean exposure length of the internal mammary vessels was 1.7 cm (range, 1.3-2.2 cm). All flaps survived completely postoperatively, and wounds and incisions at donor sites healed primarily. All patients were followed up 8-26 months (mean, 12 months). All patients were satisfied with the reconstructive outcomes. No collapse deformity or discomfort of the thoracic wall occurred.The rib-sparing technique for internal mammary vessels exposure and anastomosis is a reliable and reproducible approach to reconstruct the breast and repair the thoracic wall with DIEP flap, and it can reduce collapse deformity of the thoracic wall.",

The degrees of pain were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) at the beginning and the end of the operation. Adverse effects and the overall satisfaction on analgesic therapy were assessed when operation finished.The VAS scores of the experimental group were significantly lower than the control group at the beginning and the end of operation (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in side effects (P > 0.05).Oxycodone/Acetaminophen could produce preemptive effect. Preoperative oral administration of Oxycodone/ Acetaminophen may provide patients with good analgesia in plastic and cosmetic operation.",

Meanwhile, although rare, severe complications related to AFG including vision loss, stroke even death could be seen in the literature.A comprehensive research of PubMed database to June 2013 was performed according to guidelines of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Fat Graft Task Force Assessment Methodology. Articles were screened using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.Data collected included patient characteristics, surgical technique, donor site, recipient site, graft amount, and quantified measurement methods. Patient cohorts were pooled, and SR was calculated. All the severe complications were also summarized according to the different clinical characteristics.Of 550 articles, 16 clinical articles and 10 animal studies met the inclusion criteria and provided quantified measurement methods. Totally, 596 patients were included. SR varied from 34% to 82% in breast and 30-83% in the facial area. Nude mice were applied to investigate human fat grafting SR (38.3-52.5% after 15 weeks). Rabbits were commonly used to study animal AFG SR (14.00-14.56% after 1-year). Totally, 21 severe complications were reported, including death (2), stroke (10), vision loss (11, 8 of which accompanied with stroke), sepsis (3), multiple abscess (1) and giant fat necrotic cyst (2). Ten of these complications happened within 10 years.There is no unified measurement method to evaluate fat graft SR until now and no clinical evidence to show better SR according to different donor and recipient cite. Body mass index change between pre- and postoperation may be the bias factor in evaluating fat SR. Fat embolisms of the ophthalmic artery and the middle cerebral artery are the most severe complication of AFG and still lack of effective treatment.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the correction of secondary breast deformities after removement of injected polyacrylamide hydrophilic gel (PAHG).From March 2003 to March 2008, 100 patients with bilateral breast augmentation with injected PAHG underwent operation to remove the PAHG. The age of patients ranged from 35 to 50 years. Ultrasound and MRI were performed before operation to show the distribution of PAHG and the muscle infiltration around the PAHG. According to the PAHG distribution, muscle infiltration, skin elasticity, infection and PAHG residue, the patients were treated respectively with breast implants at the same stage or at the second stage, or without implants.The patients were followed up for 3 months to 3 years. The percentage of satisfactory, median satisfactory and dissatisfactory was 90%, 9%, and 1%. In the median satisfactory group, 3 breasts in 3 cases showed slight capsular contracture (Baker II), 8 implants in 6 cases were palpable on the lower pole of the breasts. The middle-aged patient in dissatisfactory group was not satisfied with the high-projected implants shape which were chosen by herself and placed at the second stage. Then implants were removed. There was no complication of implant hernia, infection, wound disruption, or asymmetry.The secondary breast deformities could be corrected by breast augmentation with implants. Both breast appearance and the psychological affection can be improved.",

        "abstract": "Autologous cartilage has been widely accepted as the frame material of ear reconstruction for patients with microtia. Although rare, there are multiple complications related with the surgical reconstruction techniques. The authors performed a systematic review of the English literature of microtia reconstruction to determine significant surgical factors that are predictors of postoperative complications.A PubMed search using the terms \"ear reconstruction\" and \"microtia\" was conducted. Articles were screened using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data collected included patient characteristics, surgical techniques, the incidence of all kinds of complications, and the specific postoperative morbidity. Patient cohorts were pooled, and the incidence of complications was calculated. Significant predictors such as the use of tissue expander, simultaneously mid-ear reconstruction, with/without skin graft, and different fascia coverage were analyzed by chi-square test.Of 320 articles found, 60 met the inclusion criteria. Totally 9415 patients with microtia were analyzed in this review with 1525 cases with complications. The overall complication incidence is 16.2% in average with a range of 0-72.9%. There was no significant difference when comparing the overall complication rate between with/without preexpansion 2-stage and multiple-stage techniques or with/without mid-ear reconstruction simultaneously.Although there is little agreement in literature regarding risk factors for complications, the authors were able to demonstrate several significant predictors by systematically analyzing 60 articles. Improved knowledge of the incidence of different complications related with various surgical methods can help surgeons provide improved preoperative counseling and take measures to minimize the risk.",

        "abstract": "Postoperative pain management is of great importance in perioperative anesthetic care. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been described as an effective technique to reduce postoperative pain and morphine consumption after open lower abdominal operations. Meanwhile, local anesthetic infiltration (LAI) is also commonly used as a traditional method. However, the effectiveness of these two methods has not been compared before.A meta-analysis of all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to compare the efficacy of single shot TAP block with that of single shot LAI for postoperative analgesia in adults. Major medical databases and trial registries were searched for published and unpublished RCTs. The endpoints include postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, morphine requirement, and rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMDs) were formulated; for dichotomous data, risk ratios (RR) were calculated. Results were derived using a random-/fixed-effects model with 95% confidence interval (CI).Four RCTs, encompassing 96 TAP-block and 100 LAI patients, were included in the final analysis. Patients in the TAP-block group had lower VAS pain scores 24 hours postoperatively compared with the LAI group, both at rest (WMD [95% CI]\u2009=\u2009-0.67 [p &amp;lt; 0.01] and with movement (WMD\u2009=\u2009-0.89, p &amp;lt; 0.01). There were no significant between-group differences in 24-hour postoperative morphine requirements, the rates if PONV or VAS pain scores at 2 and 4 h postoperatively.TAP block and LAI provide comparable short-term postoperative analgesia, but TAP block has better long-lasting effect.",

In each animal, 4 expanders (100 ml) were designed to be implanted at the bilateral side of back. Normal skin control was also designed at the back. The skin histologic change and flap survival rate were detected and analyzed when the expansion volume changed.The flap survival rate increased along with the increase of expansion volume. While the survival rate decreased when the expansion volume was exceeded to 100% over content.In soft tissue and skin expansion, the flap survival rate and the flap size increased as the expansion is over the standard volume, while over-expansion to 100% over content may cause decreased survival rate of expanded flap.",

        "abstract": "Keloids are scars that extend beyond the borders of the original wound. They are difficult to cure because of their high recurrence rate, particularly in large keloids that require skin grafts. This article describes a study to compare the effectiveness of a new technique, a combination precut, preradiotherapy method, with the conventional surgical method of keloid skin graft treatment.Fifty-three patients with chest wall keloids were treated from April 2005 to June 2011. Twenty-nine patients were treated with conventional surgery and radiotherapy. Keloids were removed from these patients, and their wounds were closed with skin grafts. If the grafts survived well, radiotherapy was applied, and the sutures were removed. Twenty-four patients were treated using the novel precut, preradiotherapy method. An incision was made down to the subcutaneous layer around the edge of the keloid, and radiotherapy was applied on the following day. Then the keloid was removed, and the wound was closed using a skin graft. Radiotherapy was applied for the second time when the graft was found to have survived. Patients underwent follow-up examinations 6 and 12 months after surgery. The scar at the operation site and aesthetic satisfaction were recorded and compared.The recurrence rate was 55.2% in the conventional group and 16.7% in the precut group, a significant difference (\u03c7(2)  = 6.73, p < .01). There was a significant difference in aesthetic satisfaction between the two groups, with 48.3% in the conventional group rating their satisfaction as poor versus 8.3% in the precut group (\u03c7(2)  = 7.50, p < .01).The precut, preradiotherapy strategy may be a promising treatment option for patients with large keloids that require excision and skin graft repair.",

This observational report reveals characteristics of patients who develop MU.An incidence of 0.7% of MU was found amongst patients complaining of existing scars in our study; burns and trauma were the most common etiology of MU. The mean latency period was 29 years (SD\u2009=\u200919) and the mean post-ulceration period was 7 years (SD\u2009=\u20099). Statistical analysis revealed a negative correlation between the age of patients at injury and the length of latency period (r\u2009=\u2009-0.8, P <0.01), as well as the lengths of pre-ulceration and post-ulceration periods (r\u2009=\u2009-0.7, P <0.01).Patients experience different lengths of pre- and post-ulceration periods during the latency period. Younger patients tend to have a longer latency period. Skin breakdown on chronic scars and chronic unhealed ulcers are two main sources of MU. MU may be preventable with a close surveillance of the ulcer during the latency period.",

        "abstract": "Various methods are available for vaginoplasty, but many of them have the drawbacks including surgical complexity and postoperative pain at the donor site. We herein evaluated the outcomes of vaginoplasty using tissue-engineered biomaterial graft. This study included 16 early stage cervical cancer patients who received curative surgery in combination with radiotherapy. They underwent vaginoplasty with tissue-engineered biological material, acellular dermal matrix (ADM). After treatment, a vaginal dilator was advised to be used for 6\u00a0months to prevent contraction of vagina. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by the anatomic changes of vagina before and after treatment, and the sexual outcomes at 12-month after treatment. The procedure was safe with no intra-operative complications reported. The mean operation time was 1.7 \u00b1 0.3\u00a0hours, with 11/16 patients had blood loss < 50\u00a0mL during surgery. Generally, epithelialization was observed in 2-week after treatment. At the 1-year follow-up visit, the mean vaginal width was increased significantly from 1.31 \u00b1 0.4\u00a0cm before surgery to 4.13 \u00b1 0.43\u00a0cm after surgery (p = 0.034). The vaginal length was also increased from 5.97 \u00b1 0.59\u00a0cm to 9.25 \u00b1 0.66\u00a0cm (p < 0.001). Majority of the patients (12/16) reported satisfactory sexual life. The use of ADM in vaginoplasty was a safe and effective procedure that provided satisfactory sexual function for patients with vaginal abnormalities after cervical cancer treatment.",

Objective: To optimize the cultural conditions and isolation method of human umbilical cord blood MSCs. Desing, time and setting: The cytology, in vitro, controlled study was conducted at the Central Laboratory, Peking Union Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from May 2007 to April 2008. Materials: A total of 35 samples of umbilical cord blood were obtained from fetuses of spontaneous delivery or uterine-incision delivery at the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Peking Union Hospital. Methods: Mononuclear cells were isolated from umbilical cord blood using the lymphocyte isolation method, hydroxyethyl starch sedimentation, hydroxyethyl starch sedimentation + lymphocyte isolation method. Following incubation, cells were separately cultured in DMEM/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, L-DMEM and Mesencult\u2122, at various fetal bovine serum (5%, 10% and 20%) and various cell densities (5\u00d7106, 1\u00d7107, 5\u00d7107, 1\u00d7108). At the third passage, osteoblasts were identified by Von Kossa staining. Main outcome measures: Cell isolation outcomes at various methods, media, fetal bovine serum concentrations and densities; umbilical cord blood MSC surface marker expression and osteoblasts. Results: Compared with the lymphocyte isolation method, the number of mononuclear cells significantly increased using the hydroxyethyl starch sedimentation and hydroxyethyl starch sedimentation + lymphocyte isolation method (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Primary culture time of cells was significantly shorter using the hydroxyethyl starch sedimentation + lymphocyte isolation method compared with the hydroxyethyl starch sedimentation, and the lymphocyte isolation method (P < 0.01). Cells at 5\u00d7107 were incubated in DMEM/ F12 or Mesencult\u2122 medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the T25 culture flask. Culture efficiency was higher than other condition media (P < 0.01). Adherent cells were positively for CD29 and CD105, but negatively for CD34, CD45, CD90 and CD133. After 21 days osteogenic inductive culture, black mineralization nodules appeared following Von Kossa staining. Conclusion: Plenty of umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells are obtained using the hydroxyethyl starch sedimentation + lymphocyte isolation method. Cells at 5\u00d7107 in DMEM/F12 or Mesencult\u2122 medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum can elevate the culture efficiency of umbilical cord blood MSCs.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the influence of quedcetin on the collagen synthesis of cultured fibroblasts and to explore the mechanism.Methods The inhibitory effect of quercetin and radiation on fibroblast proliferation was assayed using MTT assay.Collagen synthesis was detected by hydroxyproline colorimetric analysis.Immunocytochemical staining method was used to investigate the expression of collagen \u2160 and \u2162.The mRNA expression of type\u2160,type \u2162 collagens and TGF\u03b2-1 were assayed by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) and real-time PCR technique.Results Keloid fibroblast cell proliferation and collagen synthesis of fibroblasts were inhibited by quercetin in a dose-dependent manner.Significant inhibition was observed by the treatment with quercetin and radiation together.Immunocytochemical staining indicated the IOD of type I and \u2162 collagen protein was down-regulated by quercetin and radiation.Both collagen \u2160 and collagen \u2162 gene in the quercetin groups showed a significantly decreased mRNA expression compared with that in the untreated group,especially in the group treated with both quercetin and X-ray.Procollagen gene expression was inhibited and then decreased type \u2160 and \u2162 protein syntheses of fibroblsts,particularly type \u2160 procollagen gene(P<0.01).The mRNA level of TGF\u03b2-1 gene was down-regulated by quecertin.Conclusion Quercetin associated with radiation can considerably inhibit collagen synthesis of keloid-derived fibroblast by decreasing the mRNA expression in vitro. The result ismainly accomplished by the down-regulated effect on TGF \u03b2-1 gene level.",

The purpose of this study was to introduce a technique that restores the cosmetic amelioration effectively using free anterolateral thigh adipofascial flap through anastomosis.From September 1999 to June 2011, a total of 14 patients were subjected to correction with revascularized free anterolateral thigh adipofascial flaps at the first stage. Some of them performed additional procedures, such as dermal fat flap filling, lipoinjection, liposuction, and thinning of the flap, were used for secondary minor deformities after the first-stage operation. The donor sites were closed primarily without skin grafting or other flap transplantation.All of the flaps survived, and the effect is stable during the follow-ups. Patients were quite satisfied with the symmetry and plumpness of the reconstructed faces. The donor sites were sutured directly and healed at the first stage; there were no obvious morbidities and dysfunctions.The anterolateral thigh adipofascial flap can provide adequate tissue with reliable blood supply, pliability, ease of revision, and minimal morbidity and dysfunction at the donor site. It is a safe, stable, and effective technique for hemifacial atrophy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Negative pressure wound therapy has been widely recognized, the currently published papers are limited in academic value and lack of scientific, objective, qualified index to confirm the therapy effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To systemically evaluate the clinical effect of negative pressure wound therapy, provide more evidence for its clinical application, and guide clinical research. METHODS: Fifteen articles were screened out of peer-reviewed publications(Cochran library, Embase, PubMed-Medline and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database). Scientific data were collected and evaluated by two researchers. The data were statistically analyzed with RevMan software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Only 15 random-controlled trials were finally preserved, including 10 as B-grade moderate bias risk and focused on the effect of negative pressure wound therapy on chronic wounds, and 5 as C-grade high bias risk and focused on the effect of negative pressure wound therapy on acute wounds. Therewere significant differences in the main outcome measures between negative pressure wound therapy and conventional wound therapy. As for chronic wound patients, no significant difference was observed in the operation-preparing period, reducing wound area, promoting wound granulation, and amputation rate between two therapies. As for acute wound patients, the differences were significant in the operation-preparing period, promoting wound granulation, wound infection rate, and cost materials between two therapies. However, no difference was significant in the healing of wound and hospitalization time. Our findings indicate that, negative pressure wound therapy is an effective means for both acute and chronic wounds, it can shorten operation-preparing period, promote wound granulation, and reduce amputation rate and infection rate, thus providing evidence for clinical application. The well-designed study is needed to develop high-quality random controlled trails.",

Methods Adipose tissues were isolated to obtain hADSCs. Ad5F35-EGFP and LV -EGFP were constructed and transduced hADSCs at multiple of infection MOI ranging from 0,25,50,100,200,400,800. At 1,3,7,14,21d post transduction,EGFP positive was detected by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (FCM), which was followed by cell proliferation determination assessed with MTT assay at different MOIs. After induction of hADSCs modified with EGFP, von Kossa staining and red oil O staining were performed to test the formation of calcium and oil concentration. Results hADSCs's marker CD31,CD34,CD45,CD106 and HLA-DR were negative,CD29,CD44,CD49d,CD105,CD166 were positive. Fluorescence microscopy detected high EGFP. signal with hADSCs at 1d to 7d after infection by Ad5F35-EGFP and high EGFP signal with hADSCs at 21d after infection by LV-EGFP.FCM results showed that MOI of Ad5F35-EGFP and LV-EGFP enhanced transduce efficiency of hADSCs in a dose-dependent manner. MTT assay showed that Ad5F35-EGFP ( MOI=800) A had great contrast with control group (P<0.01).

According to the location, shape, and size of the upper and lower eyelids nevus orbicularis oculi musculocutaneous flap, postauricular superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS)-pedicled flap, or reversal superficial temporal artery (STA) flap was designed to repair the eyelid defects.Ten patients were treated in this series with 10 oculi musculocutaneous flaps, 3 postauricular SMAS-pedicled flaps, and 3 reversal STA flaps. One postauricular SMAS-pedicled flap and 1 reversal STA flap showed distal flap venous refluence (reflux) obstruction and partial epidermal necrosis in the early postoperative stage, but after active treatment, they healed well and needed no surgical revision. All the other flaps survived well. Four flaps showed slight trapdoor deformation needing no revision. No other complication developed during the follow-up periods of 6 to 36 months. All the donor sites were closed directly and healed well with inconspicuous scarring. This series has exhibited satisfactory cosmetic and functional results.Treating divided eyelid nevus with well-selected skin flaps is satisfying with excellent color and texture matching, normal eyelid function, and inconspicuous donor deformity.",

None of the reports, however, involved female Chinese patients.A retrospective study of 24 female patients was conducted to guide the selection of methods of surgical reconstruction. The patients were divided into three groups according to the degree of thoracic tissue development. Type I (mild): Limited tissue loss which can be treated with simple filling with autologous fat and/or an artificial breast implant. Type II (moderate): Moderate thoracic tissue hypoplasia where the breast parenchyma can still offer adequate implant coverage. Mammoplasty using a latissimus dorsi muscular flap with an implant was performed in this group. The flap was used to fill the infraclavicular hollow, and the implant was placed in the dual-plane pocket. Type III (severe): Severe thoracic tissue hypoplasia, without sufficient parenchyma to offer implant coverage. A latissimus dorsi muscular flap was used to form a total submuscular pocket in which an implant was placed.The numbers of Type I, II, and III patients were 15, 3, and 6, respectively. All of the flaps and injected fat demonstrated good survival. Satisfactory cosmetic results were exhibited during the follow-up period of 1 to 9 years.Although this group of patients showed varied conditions, they can be roughly divided into three types according to the degree of thoracic tissue development. In our experience, this classification is simple and useful in choosing the breast reconstruction options.",

        "abstract": "Objective To discuss indications, contraindications and surgical layers of face lift using APTOS threads on the basis of anatomical study. Methods Anatomical study was performed on 20 sides of 10 head specimens, observing distributions of fat tissues and facial nerves. Results The depth of skin and subdermal tissues in the forehead was(1.9\u00b10.2)mm, in the tempora was(2.4\u00b10.3)mm,and in the bucca was(3.1\u00b10.4)mm. The supraorbital vessels and nerve ran through the frontal muscle and the galea aponeurotica into the scalp. The supratrochlear vessels and nerve ran through the frontal muscle into the frontal skin. Temporal branchs of the facial nerve ran under the superficial temporal fascia. Buccal branches of the facial nerve came out of the parotid and ran under the superficial musculo-aponeurotic system, and the secondary branches exhibited as a three-dimensional reseau. Conclusion Layers under the frontal muscle in the forehead, superficial to the superficial temporal fascia in the tempora, and superficial to the SMAS in the bucca are safe for APTOS threads implantation.",

        "abstract": "Z-plasty is widely employed in plastic surgery and its mainly functions include elongation along the axis of the scar, dispersal and realigning the scar within the lines of minimal tension. It is especially useful to release linear-scar contracture, yet difficult for wide scars. Here, we described a technique of tissue expansion followed by serial Z-plasty for several cases of severe post-burn scar contracture. In this procedure, first, full expansion should be achieved in the tissues adjacent to the contracture by tissue expansion. Then, the serial Z-plasty technique with precise trimming and adjustment is performed with adequate tension-free skin to release the contracture. Over a period of 2 years from 2015 to 2017, this technique was employed in moderate or severe post-burn scar contracture in 4 patients (1 male and 3 females) aged 14 to 40 years old. The size of contracture ranged from 5 to 27 centimeters in diameter. Improved appearance and excellent skin match was observed in our 4 patients. All patients healed uneventfully without any complications and no patient required revision surgery. The range of motion, short form-36 health survey and Vancouver Scar Scale indicated that this technique offered a durable skin coverage with satisfying appearance in these patients. Through the outcomes of our patients, tissue expansion followed by serial Z-plasty has a great potential to be a useful alternative for the treatment of scar contracture especially for contracture adjacent to cervical joints.",

        "abstract": "Keloids are a type of benign hyperplasia that cause dermatologic dysfunction and esthetic deformity by invading adjacent normal tissues. Little is known about their etiology, therefore, they are a challenge to treat using plastic surgery. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that the expression of the long non-coding RNA CACNA1G-AS1 (CAS1) is high in keloid tissue, suggesting that CAS1 is involved in keloid formation. In the present study, the aim was to identify potential keloid target proteins by exploring CAS1 biological function during cell proliferation and migration, cytokine secretion, collagen secretion and the control of calcium channel protein expression in human keloid fibroblasts. Three biopsy samples were collected from each patient with keloids at The Peking Union Medical College Hospital, which were then used to investigate the role of CAS1 in cell proliferation and migration. CAS1 silencing was also carried out using small interfering RNA; cell factors, collagen and calcium channel protein levels were compared with control cells. The interference of CAS1 expression reached 50% compared with the control group. CACNA1G and type I collagen expression was significantly downregulated by CAS1 knockdown, while the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and type III collagen was not affected. Wound healing time was longer in the CAS1-knockdown group, but there was no visible change in cell proliferation. In conclusion, CAS1 appeared to promote calcium channel protein and type I collagen expression, and to have a positive effect on cell migration in human keloid fibroblasts. Therefore it has potential as a novel therapeutic target for keloids.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be associated with differentiation, migration and apoptosis in keratinocyte. Although it has been reported that microRNA-26a (miR-26a) plays important roles in tumor cells, its biological functions in keratinocytes are still not well elucidated. In this study, we confirmed expression of miR-26a in human keratinocytes using RT-PCR and further studied the role of miR-26a in cell proliferation and cell migration. Ectopic expression of MiR-26a mimic or inhibitor increased or decreased miR-26a expression respectively in HaCaT cells. Proliferation of HaCaT keratinocyte can be suppressed or promoted by overexpression or down-expression of miR-26a. In scratch wound-healing assay and Boyden chamber cell migration assay, upregulating miR-26a expression blocked cell migration, while downregulating miR-26a expression enhanced the migration. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot, we further discovered that both mRNA and protein level of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10(PTEN) were regulated by miR-26a in HaCaT cells. Meanwhile the level of active form of AKT was also regulated by the miR-26a. In rescue experiment, knockdown of PTEN in the miR-26a mimic transduced cells recovered the migration ability of HaCaT cells. Together these results suggest that miR-26a modulates the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes via regulating PTEN/AKT signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": " Quantitative investigations of facial changes in acromegaly are rare. A new imaging technique, three-dimensional (3D) stereophotography, can accurately quantify whole facial changes. We aimed to measure facial characteristics in acromegaly patients using 3D stereophotography, analyze gender-specific features, and explore clinical influencing factors.  Single-center case-control study.  Thirty-nine acromegaly patients and 39 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects were prospectively enrolled. 3D stereophotography was performed, and facial lines and angles were quantified for each subject. Clinical information for each acromegaly patient was acquired.  The nose width, length, height and depth were longer; the upper and lower lips were thicker; the face length, face width and gonion-gnathion distances were longer; and the nasofrontal and columella-labial angles were smaller in the acromegaly patients, especially in males, than in the healthy controls, with statistical significance ( < 0.05). No differences were found in the face breadth, columella-labial angle, or nose length, height or depth between the female patient and healthy control groups. The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in the acromegaly patients were linearly and positively correlated with the nose width ( = 0.006) and gonion-gnathion distance ( = 0.029) and linearly and negatively correlated with the nasofrontal angle ( = 0.026).  The acromegaly patients' facial changes exhibit a unique trend, and the characteristics are not identical between genders. 3D stereophotography is an accurate and reliable tool for investigating facial characteristics. Recognizing the above facial features might be potential to assist in the early diagnosis and timely treatment of acromegaly and aid in predicting the severity of systemic complications.",

We identified Polymerase I and Transcript Release Factor (PTRF) as a direct target gene of miR-217 in the SCC13 cell. In addition, PTRF expression was downregulated in the cSCCcSCC tissues. Moreover, we demonstrated that there was a significant inverse correlation between miR-217 and PTRF expression in the cSCCcSCC. Furthermore, overexpression of PTRF could rescue miR-217's oncogenic effect on cSCC. Therefore, these results suggested that upregulation of miR-217 could contribute to development of cSCCcSCC through targeting PTRF.",

This review aims to systematically assess the quality of meta-analyses addressing topics in plastic surgery.Electronic databases were selected for systematic review. A search was performed focusing on communication addresses containing terms related to plastic surgery, and detailed inclusion criteria were used. Related data were extracted and recorded according to the items of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. To assess the quality of the meta-analyses over time, studies published before and after PRISMA were evaluated.A total of 116 meta-analyses were included. There was 1 study that was fully in compliance with the PRISMA items. The main flaws impacting the overall quality of the included studies were in the following areas: structured summary (48%), protocol and registration (2%), full electronic search strategy (35%), risk of bias in individual studies (41%), additional analyses (27%), risk of bias within studies (47%), additional analysis (30%), and funding (47%). Study quality was evaluated using relative risks (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI); this revealed that there were few significant improvements in adherence to the PRISMA statement after its release, especially in selection (RR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.08-2.99), results of individual studies (RR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.41-5.91), synthesis of results (RR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.32-7.17), and funding (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.21-2.24).There have been measurable improvements in the quality of meta-analyses over recent years. However, several serious deficiencies remain according to the PRISMA statement. Future reviewers should pay more attention to not only reporting the main findings but also encouraging compliance with proper standards.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Keloid is a benign tumor in the derma, which is generally treated by surgical excision and radiation in clinic. However, recurrence has been an intricate problem in treatment of keloid. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel interfering means to increase the sensitivity of keloid to radiation. Quercetin is a natural compound, which has been shown to sensitize some tumors to radiation. We tested the potential of quercetin in sensitizing keloid fibroblast to radiation and identified its downstream pathways. Methods: Keloid fibroblast cells were challenged by radiation with or without the presence of quercetin. Cellular response was detected by flow cytometry, western blot, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining. HIF-1\u03b1 was down-regulated by siRNA transfection. Results: In this study, we firstly demonstrate that keloid fibroblasts acquire resistance after IR treatment, and this can be relieved by treating with quercetin. Further, we showed that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a prognostic marker used in clinical practice after radiation therapy, was associated with stronger radioresistance in keloid fibroblast, which was downregulated after quercetin treatment. The inhibition on HIF-1 expression by quercetin was found to depend on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and quercetin also reduce phosphorylation of Akt. Conclusion: Taken together, we revealed a mechanism underlying the suppression on radioresistance by quercetin, which involves the regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 by PI3K/Akt pathway. Our study provides molecular interpretation for the application quercetin in sensitizing radiation in keloid treatment.",

        "abstract": "Keloid is characterized by red, tickling, hard and irregular raised tissues, and tends to outgrow its origin. It occurs frequently in young adults and appears as refractory to prevailing therapies. Although histological studies have revealed striking similarities of keloids with cancer, such as uncontrolled cell growth, and many of the therapies in clinical practice including -fluorouracil and tamoxifen, excision, and radiation therapy were borrowed from cancer management, the etiology of keloid has remained to be explored to provide insights for developing effective therapeutic modalities. Hypoxic stress around tumors was frequently reported as conferring growth momentum to tumor cells. The hypoxia caused by fast growing of keloid fibroblasts may also be a risk factor that antagonizes therapies. Resveratrol has received intense attention in cancer researches since its anti-proliferative effect on human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were revealed. In this study, we first revealed that hypoxia promotes proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of keloid fibroblasts, which highlights the potential obstacle in treating keloids. Further, we demonstrated resveratrol could reverse the effect of hypoxia on keloids, which involves down-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1. Moreover, the collagen synthesis of keloid fibroblasts was also inhibited by resveratrol, which was corresponding with HIF-1\u03b1 suppression. These results provide complementary evidence to the multiple molecular signalings controlled by resveratrol and suggest a pathway implicates resveratrol to regulate expression of procollagen expression via HIF-1\u03b1.",

However, the functions and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA HOXD-AS1 in melanoma remain little known. In the present study, we observed that lncRNA HOXD-AS1 expression was remarkably higher in melanoma tissues compared to skin tissues with melanocytic nevus. Increased expression of lncRNA HOXD-AS1 correlated with poor survival of melanoma patients. Furthermore, functional experiments demonstrated that upregulated lncRNA HOXD-AS1 expression dramatically promoted cell proliferation and invasion of melanoma, while downregulation of lncRNA HOXD-AS1 showed a tumor inhibiting effects on melanoma cells in vitro. In vivo, data results showed that lncRNA HOXD-AS1 knockdown notably reduced tumor growth. Additionally, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that lncRNA HOXD-AS1 could epigenetically suppress the expression of RUNX3 via binding to EZH2. Downregulation of RUNX3 attenuated the proliferation and invasion-inhibiting effects induced by lncRNA HOXD-AS1 knockdown in melanoma cells. Therefore, these results indicated that HOXD-AS1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target of melanoma.",

        "abstract": "Promoting epidermal cell survival in an oxidative stress microenvironment is vital for skin regeneration after burns and/or wounds. However, few studies have explored the mediators related to epidermal cell apoptosis in an oxidative stress microenvironment. Cellular viability was determined using the MTT assay, TUNEL staining, western blot analysis and LDH release assay. Two independent siRNAs were transfected into HaCaT cell to repress INF2 and/or HIF1 in the presence of HO. Mitochondrial function was determined using JC-1 staining, mitochondrial ROS staining, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. In the present study, our data demonstrated that the expression of inverted formin-2 (INF2) increased rapidly when the cells were exposed to HO. Interestingly, INF2 knockdown promoted HaCaT cell survival via reducing HO-mediated cell apoptosis. Molecular investigations demonstrated that INF2 deletion attenuated mitochondrial ROS overloading, restored the cellular redox balance, sustained the mitochondrial membrane potential, improved mitochondrial respiratory function and corrected the mitochondrial dynamics disorder in an HO-mimicking oxidative stress microenvironment. In addition, INF2 deletion upregulated the expression of HIF1. Interestingly, the inhibition of HIF1 increased cell death and caused mitochondrial stress despite the deletion of INF2, suggesting that the HIF1 signaling pathway is required for INF2 deletion-mediated HaCaT cell survival and mitochondrial protection. Altogether, our results identified INF2 as a novel apoptotic mediator for oxidative stress-mediated HaCaT cell death via modulating mitochondrial stress and repressing the HIF1 signaling pathway. This finding provides evidence to support the critical role played by the INF2-HIF1 axis in regulating mitochondrial stress and epidermal cell viability in an oxidative stress microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "Wound dressings of cell-laden bulk hydrogel or scaffold were mainly applied for enhanced cell engraftment in contrast to free cell injection. However, dressing of cells laden in biomaterials on wound surface might not effectively and timely exert functions on deep or chronic wounds where insufficient blood supply exists. Previously, we developed injectable gelatin microcryogels (GMs) which could load cells for enhanced cell delivery and cell therapy. In this study, biological changes of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) laden in GMs were compared in varied aspects with traditional two dimensional (2D) cell culture, such as cell phenotype markers, stemness genes, differentiation, secretion of growth factors, cell apoptosis and cell memory by FACS, QRT-PCR and ELISA, that demonstrated the priming effects of GMs on upregulation of stemness genes and improved secretion of growth factors of hASCs for potential augmented wound healing. In a full-thickness skin wound model in nude mice, multisite injection and dressing of hASCs-laden GMs could significantly accelerate the healing compared to free cell injection. Bioluminescence imaging and protein analysis indicated improved cell retention and secretion of multiple growth factors. Our study suggests that GMs as primed injectable 3D micro-niches represent a new cell delivery methodology for skin wound healing which could not only benefit on the recovery of wound bed but also play direct effects on wound basal layer for healing enhancement. Injectable GMs as facile multisite cell delivery approach potentially provide new minimally-invasive therapeutic strategy for refractory wounds such as diabetic ulcer or radiative skin wound. Statement of significance This work applied a type of elastic micro-scaffold (GMs) to load and prime hMSCs for skin wound healing. Due to the injectability of GMs, the 3D cellular micro-niches could simply realize minimally-invasive and multisite cell delivery approach for accelerating the wound healing process superior to free cell injection. The biological features of MSCs has been thoroughly characterized during 3D culture in GMs (i.e. cell proliferation, characterization of cell surface markers, stemness of MSCs in GMs, differentiation of MSCs in GMs, secretion of MSCs in GMs, induced apoptosis of MSCs in GMs). Multiple methods such as bioluminescent imaging, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, ELSA and western blot were used to assess the in vivo results between groups.",

        "abstract": "Network processors have exploited many aspects of architecture design, such as employing multi-core, multi-threading and hardware accelerator, to support both the ever-increasing line rates and the higher complexity of network applications. Micro-architectural techniques like superscalar, deep pipeline and speculative execution provide an excellent method of improving performance without limiting either the scalability or flexibility, provided that the branch penalty is well controlled. However, it is difficult for traditional branch predictor to keep increasing the accuracy by using larger tables, due to the fewer variations in branch patterns of packet processing. To improve the prediction efficiency, we propose a flow-based prediction mechanism which caches the branch histories of packets with similar header fields, since they normally undergo the same execution path. For packets that cannot find a matching entry in the history table, a fallback gshare predictor is used to provide branch direction. Simulation results show that the our scheme achieves an average hit rate in excess of 97.5% on a selected set of network applications and real-life packet traces, with a similar chip area to the existing branch prediction architectures used in modern microprocessors.",

        "abstract": "Future Internet requires re-thinking of network infrastructure towards the balance between computing capacities and energy sustainable techniques. As one of computing intensive components, Bloom filters are widely used for network packet processing. In this paper, an energy efficient self-adaptive Bloom filter, EABF, is devoted to a balance of power and performance especially for high performance networks. The basic idea is to give the Bloom Filter the capability to adjust the number of active hash functions according to the current workload automatically. This adaption depends on its control policies. Three policies are presented and compared. We also give the method to implement EABF in hardware for higher performance. It is presented in a two-stage platform based on FPGA where Stage 1 is always active and Stage 2, a secondary stage, is only active when necessary. The platform can also be extended to multi-stages. A control circuit is designed for flexibly changing working stage and reducing both dynamic and static power consumption. Analysis and experiments show that our dynamic two-stage EABF can achieve almost the best power savings as that of the fixed schemes; unlike the fixed schemes that might have much longer latency, EABF maintains nearly 1 clock cycle latency as that of a regular Bloom filter.",

        "abstract": "Meeting the future requirements of higher bandwidth while providing ever more complex functions, future network processors will require a number of methods of improving processing performance. One such method will involve deeper processor pipelines to obtain higher operating frequencies. Mitigation of the penalty costs associated with deeper pipelines have achieved by implementing prediction schemes, with previous execution history used to determine future decisions. In this paper we present an analysis of common branch prediction schemes when applied to network applications. Using widespread network applications, we find that unlike general purpose processing, hit rates in excess of 95% can be obtained in a network processor using a small 256- entry single level predictor. While our research demonstrates the low silicon cost of implementing a branch predictor, the long run times of network applications can leave the majority of the predictor logic idle, increasing static power and reducing device utilization. \u00a9 2008 IEEE.",

It does this by measuring the energy used to build the search structure during preprocessing for each of the five algorithms and the average energy taken to classify a packet. To do this we implemented all five algorithms in C code and used a microarchitectural power simulation tool called Sim-Panalyzer to estimate the power dissipated by the five algorithms while running on a SA1100 StrongARM RISC processor similar to the type found on many of today's programmable network processors. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.",

This paper proposes an efficient ultra high-speed IPv6 packet classification engine (classifier) based on TCAM (Ternary Content Addressable Memory). With the utilization of parallelism and pipeline, the classifier can output a classification result within a single TCAM access and process IPv6 packets at wire speed for OC192 and beyond. With a dynamic range encoding method , it greatly reduces the storage requirements for TCAM and increases the updating speed. Through the high memory utilization, it can support large rule sets with sizes over IM rules. Given a TCAM running at a frequency of 66MHZ, it can classify IPv6 packets at a speed of over 22M packets per second (Mpps) with route lookup of identical speed performed simultaneously on the same TCAM, and in the meanwhile guarantee at least 83.5k/s updating speed.",

The need to keep up with ever-increasing line speed has forced NIDS designers to move to hardware or high-speed memory where memory resources are limited. In this paper, we present LBM, a novel accelerating scheme for regular expression matching which converts the original byte stream into much shorter integer stream and then matches it with a variant of DFA, called StriD2FA. In the instance of LBM that we realize, 10-15 speedup is reasonable while the memory is much smaller than traditional DFA.",

We also present a high speed hardware C 2BF architecture with off-chip memory and fast cache replacement method.

        "abstract": "String matching is a key technique for network security applications such as network intrusion detection systems and antivirus scanners, where the payload of every packet is inspected against thousands of patterns in real time. As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.",

        "abstract": "Today's routers need to perform packet classification at wire speed in order to provide critical services such as traffic billing, priority routing and blocking unwanted Internet traffic. With everincreasing ruleset size and line speed, the task of implementing wire speed packet classification with reduced power consumption remains difficult. Software approaches are unable to classify packets at wire speed as line rates reach OC-768, while state of the art hardware approaches such as TCAM still consume large amounts of power. This paper presents a low power architecture for a high speed packet classifier which can meet OC-768 line rate. The architecture consists of an adaptive clocking unit which dynamically changes the clock speed of an energy efficient packet classifier to match fluctuations in traffic on a router line card. It achieves this with the help of a scheme developed to keep clock frequencies at the lowest speed capable of servicing the line card while reducing frequency switches. The low power architecture has been tested on OC-48, OC-192 and OC-768 packet traces created from real life network traces obtained from NLANR while classifying packets using synthetic rulesets containing up to 25,000 rules. Simulation results of our classifier implemented on a Cyclone 3 and Stratix 3 FPGA, and as an ASIC show that power savings of between 17--88% can be achieved, using our adaptive clocking unit rather than a fixed clock speed.",

        "abstract": "Packet Classification serves as a plinth for many newly emerging network applications. Most of the previous packet classification schemes are IPv4-oriented, and some of them have achieved high throughput with chip-level parallelism of Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAM). However, due to their inefficient utilization of TCAM resources, further upgrade incurs prohibitive hardware costs. As IPv6 will dominate the Next Generation Internet, IPv6-oriented packet classification is of increasing importance. In this paper, we propose a packet classification scheme geared towards IPv6. This scheme incorporates efficient and flexible algorithms for parallelism and distributed storing, which provides an unprecedentedly high throughput with relatively low storage costs. Our scheme also integrates delicate parallel encoding algorithms to maximize the TCAM utilization and increase its throughput. Using commercially available TCAM, the scheme is able to classify 266 million IPv6 packets per second (Mpps), matching 4\u00d7OC-768 (160 Gbps) line rate. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.",

One such method will involve deeper processor pipelines to obtain higher operating frequencies. Mitigation of the penalty costs associated with deeper pipelines have achieved by implementing prediction schemes, with previous execution history used to determine future decisions. In this paper we present an analysis of common branch prediction schemes when applied to network applications. Using widespread network applications, we find that unlike general purpose processing, hit rates in excess of 95% can be obtained in a network processor using a small 256-entry single level predictor. While our research demonstrates the low silicon cost of implementing a branch predictor, the long run times of network applications can leave the majority of the predictor logic idle, increasing static power and reducing device utilization.",

In this study, we thoroughly evaluate the performance of caches in NP with architectural features like multicore, multithread, and integrated packet interface. Our major findings include: (1) In general, a sufficiently large cache effectively reduces the number of memory requests and improves the utilization of the NP computation power. (2) The lower efficiency of private caches caused by duplicate information deteriorates the NP performance under certain circumstances. (3) The appropriate cache block size is constrained by the low spatial locality of network applications. (4) For workloads involving large amount of data movement, increasing cache size cannot bring more benefits when the bottleneck in interconnection bus is reached. In short, caching mechanism in NP can be helpful under appropriate usage.",

A flow is used to decide a packet's priority and the manner in which it is processed. Packet classification is a difficult task due to the fact that all packets must be processed at wire speed and rulesets can contain tens of thousands of rules. The contribution of this paper is a hardware accelerator that can classify up to 433 million packets per second when using rulesets containing tens of thousands of rules with a peak power consumption of only 9.03 W when using a Stratix III field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The hardware accelerator uses a modified version of the HyperCuts packet classification algorithm, with a new pre-cutting process used to reduce the amount of memory needed to save the search structure for large rulesets so that it is small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. The modified algorithm also removes the need for floating point division to be performed when classifying a packet, allowing higher clock speeds and thus obtaining higher throughputs.",

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets. It can achieve a throughput of over 40 Gbps (OC-768) when implemented on a Stratix 3 FPGA and over 10 Gbps (OC-192) when implemented on the lower power Cyclone 3 FPGA.",

Deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is widely used for multipattern matching, while the link bandwidth and the traffic of the Internet are rapidly increasing, high performance and low storage cost DFA-based NIDS is strongly required. In this paper, we propose a parallel Length-based matching (LBM) architecture to increase the throughput without extra memory cost. The basic idea is to process multiple characters between some specific tags in parallel. We propose a multiple hash functions solution to reduce the possibility of false positive. The evaluation shows that our parallel architecture can reduce nearly 55% processing time with less memory consumption than the traditional DFA.

        "abstract": "With an ever growing number of packet processing applications and an increasing volume of Internet traffic the need to design networking equipment for both low power and high throughput is as important as ever. In this paper we present a scheme for frequency scaling, which adjusts the clock frequency to a packet classification hardware accelerator so that it matches the incoming traffic volume to a router's line card. This is done by buffering the incoming packets and then using the number of packets buffered as a threshold to run the packet classification hardware accelerator at the lowest clock frequency that can service the buffer without dropping packets. To do this we developed a scheme which keeps the number of clock frequency switches to a minimum. Simulation results show that savings of up to 19% can be made when a packet classification hardware accelerator with frequency scaling is implemented on a Startix 3 FPGA, and up to 57% power savings can be achieved when implemented on Cyclone 3 FPGA.",

        "abstract": "Deep packet inspection has become a key component in network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes), where every packet in the incoming data stream needs to be compared with patterns in an attack database, byte-by-byte, using either string matching or regular expression matching. Regular expression matching, despite its flexibility and efficiency in attack identification, brings significantly high computation and storage complexities to NIDSes, making line-rate packet processing a challenging task. In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information. The presented StriFA technique has been implemented in software and evaluated based on different traces. The simulation results show that the StriFA acceleration scheme offers an increased speed over traditional nondeterministic finite automaton/deterministic finite automaton, while at the same time reducing the memory requirement.",

However, while many researches are only focused on the first one, the second has not been solved perfectly- In mis paper, a high-speed NP architecture is proposed to handle both of the two issues simultaneously, where a centralized state controller with hardware flow chains is employed to schedule the CPU cores fairly and to transmit the packets orderly. We also introduce Local Memory to increase CPU utilization as well as to store packets that can't be sent out immediately due to flow constraints. We implement the NP prototype with an FPGA, upon which a series of experiments are carried out, and the results indicate that it can achieve both of the two goals perfectly \u00a92005 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Deterministic Finite Automatons (DFAs) are widely used to perform regular expression based pattern matching for network security. Most of DFA compression algorithms consider only one type of redundant information in DFA. After a comprehensive analysis of different redundancies in DFA structure, we summarize four types of redundancies with large compression potentials. An improved DFA method, Tag-DFA, is proposed to exploit more than one kind of redundancy to compress DFA transitions and a reference table is added to accelerate DFA inspection. Compared with a well-known algorithm D 2FA, Tag-DFA achieves more than 90% compression ratio and it requries at most two states traversal for each character, rather than multiple default transitions in D 2FA. Despite a larger contruction complexity than D 2FA, Tag-DFA guarantees a higher throughput with less memory cost. \u00a9 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

Clock synchronization is crucial, especially in time sensitive networking scenarios that every time stamp matters. The Precise Time Protocol PTP standard enables precise clock synchronization in multicast capable networks. With hardware time stamping, the standard provides exceptionally tight clock synchronization with the accuracy within the nanosecond range. For this reason, the PTP enabled routers have been widespread in recent years. However, the performance is traditionally the primary concern in these routers without drawing enough attention on router power consumption. This work builds an energy efficient PTP router using dynamic frequency scaling towards green networking. Results indicate that, when in idle state, the proposed router can significantly reduce up to 16.89i\u00be\u017a% of the power consumption.",

        "abstract": "Edge networks deliver computing services close to the user, unlike centralized clouds. This improves service scalability and delay-sensitive functions can be offloaded to the edge, when the latency incurred by cloud services is too high. Since services in edge networks, by their nature, are not centralized, careful design is required to achieve efficient resource utilization and low power consumption. These issues are addressed in this paper. A network device power model is formulated to explore the power dissipation characteristics of frequency scalable CMOS devices (as measured using a NetFPGA testbed). An on-demand energy-efficient resource allocation model (OERA) is designed based on this model. OERA features acceptance ratios that are 11%\u201317% higher than existing solutions and 9% lower power consumption. A novel algorithm is presented for resource placement in edge networks, which can accommodate higher traffic flow demands and distribution distance than existing solutions. This uses mixed integer linear programming to simultaneously maximize the aggregate flow demands and to minimize the network energy consumption. An iterative algorithm and a heuristic greedy edge network device placement algorithm are implemented that not only solve this NP-Hard problem but also significantly reduce the network energy consumption.",

These networks present two key challenges of security and resource limitations. Lightweight ciphers are suitable to provide data security in such constrained environments. Implementing the lightweight PRESENT encryption algorithm in a reconfigurable platform (FPGAs) can offer secure communication service and flexibility. This paper presents hardware acceleration of security primitives in SDN using NETFPGA-10G. We implement an efficient design of the PRESENT algorithm for faster, smaller and lower power consumption hardware circuit using Verilog.

The technology of cryptography has been used for applications such as banking, transport of classified information and even to transfer detailed instructions to the front lines of the battlefield in times of war. As technology moves forward and semiconductor devices miniaturise in accordance with Moores law electronic devices are becoming faster, smaller and cheaper. These devices are constantly increasing in what they are capable of doing. Small scale devices such are RFID tag and contact-less credit cards require the information stored on the device be kept secure. The technology of lightweight cryptography has been utilised in these devices to provide a fast lightweight solution to keeping information secure. This paper looks at the PRESENT cipher, which is a lightweight block cipher designed to be easily implemented in hardware. This paper looks at the different implementations of the PRESENT algorithm in both hardware and software, and compare its performance on different platforms.",

In this paper, we use gigabit routers to measure and evaluate the impacts of green technologies in different scenarios. These programmable NetFPGA based routers come with the inbuilt feature of frequency scaling which can reduce the operational frequency of the board by half from 125MHz to 62.5MHz. Router power consumption is compared for standard and low frequency modes with different numbers of activated ports. Perpacket and per-byte energy costs in different cases with different packet sizes are measured and analyzed to evaluate the effects of frequency adjustment. Finally, a simple energy model for real traffic is proposed and evaluated. This paper reveals the internal power usage of a gigabit router at the granularity of packet, and header and payload byte level, and offers the reader a clear understanding of the potential power savings at different operational router frequencies, for different numbers of activated ports, various traffic loads and packet sizes, which would assist the green data center networks.",

However, how to effectively exploit the green capabilities is still a big challenge, especially given the high heterogeneity of devices and their internal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical power management architecture (HPMA) which represents physical components whose power can be monitored and controlled at various levels of a device as entities. We use energy aware state (EAS) as the power management setting mode of each device entity. The power policy controller is capable of getting information on how many EASes of the entity are manageable inside a device, and setting a certain EAS configuration for the entity. We propose the optimal local control policy which aims to minimize the router power consumption while meeting the performance constraints. A first-order Markov chain is used to model the statistical features of the network traffic load. The dynamic EAS configuration problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. In addition, we demonstrate a reference implementation of the HPMA and EAS concept in a NetFPGA frequency scaled router which has the ability of toggling among five operating frequency options and/or turning off unused Ethernet ports.",

In this paper, we explore this topic with a traffic aware design that can automatically adapt the router\u2019s energy consumption to the network traffic in real time with transitions at the scale from microseconds to nanoseconds. In this paper, we make three contributions. First, we propose an energy efficient router architecture using frequency scaling, which is extended from the contemporary line card architecture of the router. Second, we prototype our architecture on a gigabit NetFPGA platform, which extends a router design on that platform to dynamically work at six frequencies. Then, we discuss the implementation in detail and present a per-packet-based power consumption model from real-world measurements. Third, we further propose four algorithms, which efficiently and automatically adapt power grades under the methodology of periodical and threshold-based scaling. Our experiments are carried out on two platforms, a NetFPGA prototype for feasible scenarios and a simulator for other scenarios in excess of the NetFPGA port limit with parameters synthetically generated to the real-world measurement. Experimental results show that approximately 25% power can be saved with our architecture and algorithms. Conclusions are also given to summarize our findings.",

This paper presents an energy-efficient router that is able to dynamically adapt its routing capability in response to real-time traffic load, achieving energy proportional routing. The NetFPGA reference router, which operates at one of two frequencies (125 MHz or 62.5 MHz), requires a board reset to switch frequencies. We have modified the reference router to allow dynamic switching among five operating frequencies. Experiments with real traces indicate that, compared to the reference router, a 10% power reduction can be achieved through dynamic frequency scaling. When the router is further modified to support green traffic engineering and Ethernet port shut-down, power consumption can be reduced by 46% while maintaining the required quality of service. This allows the router to meet the instantaneous performance requirements while minimizing power dissipation. Similar results can be expected when these general power-saving principles are applied in future commercial routers.",

Particularly, in order to estimate available energy in each node to intelligently optimize the base station by combining with the state of load, an improved grey model is put forward for green energy forecast in smart green base station GBS, so that the smart GBS can be self-sufficient in energy under the premise of ensuring the quality of communication.

        "abstract": "Software defined networking (SDN) is revolutionizing the telecommunication networking industry by providing flexible and efficient management. Because of energy cost and environmental concerns, green networking technologies are being developed to increasing energy efficiency and making use of renewable energy, for both wired and wireless networks. Relay nodes (RNs) are widely used in wireless networks to increasing energy efficiency as well as the network coverage. In this paper, we consider an SDN-enabled wireless relay network, in which the relay nodes are powered by renewable energy. In the beginning, all the users can connect to a BS or an RN in the most energy efficient way, however, the availability of renewable energy is unpredictable, and users connected to an RN will have to be handed over to base stations (BSs) when there is not enough renewable energy to power the RN. There are also occasions when an RN harvested more renewable energy than required to server the users connected to it, in these cases users connected to BS or other RNs can be transferred to connect through this RN, otherwise the harvested surplus renewable energy will be wasted as it cannot be stored. We transform the problem of optimizing the use of harvested renewable energy into a flow-table management problem. A model of harvested renewable energy available for RNs is built first, then we propose a dynamic flow-table updating strategy (DFTUS), which is driven by the availability of renewable energy, to maximize the use of the harvested renewable energy and thus minimize the use of traditional energy. DFTUS can be integrated as an application on top of an SDN controller. Simulation results show that DFTUS can make more efficient use of renewable energy thus make the overall relay network more energy efficient compared with other routing strategies such as the capacity limited strategy (CLS) and the optimal path strategy (OPS).",

        "abstract": "In order to realize green communication, we consider a cognitive radio network where the secondary user (SU) is equipped with RF energy harvesting capability. The three-state Markov chain is used to model the primary user (PU) channel, which considers both the channel occupation information of the primary network and the channel quality information. We assume that the SU cannot execute RF energy harvesting and packet transmission at the same time. Consequently, at the beginning of each time slot, the SU should make the decision to harvest RF energy or to transmit a packet. The mode decision depends on the channel state and the available energy in the energy queue. We formulate the mode management problem of the SU as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem that can be solved using dynamic programming. The objective of the proposed strategy is to maximize the expected number of packets successfully transmitted. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",

In this paper, considering the scenario with time-varying channel state, stochastic harvested energy arrival process and unknown traffic arrival process under grid power constraints, we propose a unified framework for utilizing both physical-layer and network-layer techniques to achieve the maximum data delivery ratio, bandwidth efficiency and harvested energy utilization. We assume the channel gains follow the finite-state Markov channel model, and model the traffic and the harvested energy arrival as Markov processes. We formulate the optimal problem of route selection and resource management as an ant colony optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy achieves an improved performance in terms of average transmission delay, packet delivery ratio, bandwidth efficiency and harvested energy utilization under time-varying network environment.",

The proposed algorithm is mobility robustness, which means that the HO performance is robust against the change in UE mobility. In order to realize the mobility robustness, the proposed algorithm adaptively adjusts the HO parameters through Q-learning.

        "abstract": "Modular multiplication is the fundamental and compute-intense operation in many Public-Key crypto-systems. This paper presents two modular multipliers with their efficient architectures based on Booth encoding, higher-radix, and Montgomery powering ladder approaches. Montgomery powering ladder technique enables concurrent execution of main operations in the proposed designs, while higher-radix techniques have been adopted to reduce an iteration count which formally dictates a cycle count. It is also shown that by an adopting Booth encoding logic in the designs helps to reduce their area cost with a slight degradation in the maximum achievable frequencies. The proposed designs are implemented in Verilog HDL and synthesized targeting virtex-6 FPGA platform using Xilinx ISE 14.2 Design suite. The radix-4 multiplier computes a 256-bit modular multiplication in 0.93 \u03bcs, occupies 1.6K slices, at 137.87 MHz in a cycle count of dn/2e+2, whereas the radix-8 multiplier completes the operation in 0.69 \u03bcs, occupies 3.6K slices, achieves 123.43 MHz frequency in a cycle count of dn/3e+4. The implementation results reveals that the proposed designs consumes 18% lower FPGA slices without any significant performance degradation as compared to their best contemporary designs.",

        "abstract": "The higher computational complexity of an elliptic curve scalar point multiplication operation limits its implementation on general purpose processors. Dedicated hardware architectures are essential to reduce the computational time, which results in a substantial increase in the performance of associated cryptographic protocols. This paper presents a unified architecture to compute modular addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations over a finite field of large prime characteristic GFp. Subsequently, dual instances of the unified architecture are utilized in the design of high speed elliptic curve scalar multiplier architecture. The proposed architecture is synthesized and implemented on several different Xilinx FPGA platforms for different field sizes. The proposed design computes a 192-bit elliptic curve scalar multiplication in 2.3\u2009ms on Virtex-4 FPGA platform. It is 34% faster and requires 40% fewer clock cycles for elliptic curve scalar multiplication and consumes considerable fewer FPGA slices as compared to the other existing designs. The proposed design is also resistant to the timing and simple power analysis SPA attacks; therefore it is a good choice in the construction of fast and secure elliptic curve based cryptographic protocols.",

It exploited a best available possible parallelism of elliptic curve points in projective representation. The proposed hardware for ECC is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-4, Virtex-5 and Virtex-6 FPGAs. A 256-bit scalar multiplication is completed in 2.01\u00a0 ms, 2.62\u00a0 ms and 3.91\u00a0 ms on Virtex-6, Virtex-5 and Virtex-4 FPGA platforms, respectively. The results show that the proposed design is 1.96 times faster with insignificant increase in area consumption as compared to the other reported designs.

The modular arithmetic components in the proposed ECC processor are highly optimized at both architectural level and circuit level. Redundant-signed-digit (RSD) arithmetic is adopted in the modular arithmetic components to avoid lengthy carry propagation delay. A high speed modular multiplier is designed based on an efficient segmentation and pipelining strategy. The clock cycle count is reduced as result of the segmentation, whereas operating frequency and throughput are significantly increased due to the pipelining. An optimized pipelined architecture for modular division is also presented which is suitable for the design of ECC processor using projective coordinates. The Joye\u2019s double and add (DAA) algorithm based on XY-only common Z (co-Z) coordinate is adopted at the system level for its regular and efficient behavior. The proposed ECC...",

        "abstract": "In the push towards greener ICT, there is a need to examine the energy savings possible in the design of network infrastructure and each network component. The focus of this paper is to evaluate the impact of routing algorithms on the power consumption of network routers. In a comparison of the power consumption of a number of routers implementing different routing protocols on the open source NetFPGA board, our results show the Bloom filter-based zFilter forwarding node is the greenest router. The rate control protocol (RCP) router and the precision time protocol (PTP) router consume almost identical power, which is about 1.1\u20131.6% higher than that of the reference router. This higher power consumption of RCP and PTP routers is attributed to the 3.6%\u20134.7% higher power consumption in the 3.3-V power component of the total power consumption, which is due to the higher router design complexity. Furthermore, we examined the impact of scaling down the core operational clock frequency to demonstrate the merits of energy proportional routing in each of the routers. The zFilter, operating at 62.5\u00a0MHz, outperforms the RCP, PTP, and the reference routers operating at 125\u00a0MHz, in terms of both packet loss and throughput. In addition, the zFilter operating at 62.5\u00a0MHz consumes around 10.9\u201311.2% less power than the reference router operating at 125\u00a0MHz. We analyze the architecture of each router to further explain these results.",

        "abstract": "Recently, network energy consumption and carbon emission statistics show an alarming and growing trend. Such high power requirement can be mainly due to networking hardwares (primarily router processors) designed to operate at maximum capacity with constant and highest energy consumption, independent of the network traffic load. However, recent developments of green network on-chip systems using power proportional technologies suggest the chance to adapt their performance and energy consumption to meet actual workload and operational requirements. In such a scenario, this paper aims at implementing a low power networking processing system by on-chip Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DFS) and Physical Port Switch (PPS), and proposing a control scheme to minimise the number of clock frequency switches that maximises energy saving with negligible Quality of Service(QoS) loss overhead.",

The aim of this study was to measure YAP gene expression and protein levels during rat liver regeneration and in liver cancer, and to explore possible correlations between YAP levels and cancer cell proliferation following partial hepatectomy. We examined YAP expression in rat regenerating liver using real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemical methods. YAP mRNA and protein levels were measured in human hepatocellular carcinoma. The results demonstrated that YAP protein levels were markedly increased in the regenerating liver (2.5-3 times), while YAP mRNA levels decreased slightly (1.47-2.17 times) (P=0.017). YAP mRNA and protein levels were both higher in hepatocellular carcinoma than in para-cancerous tissue. In conclusion, liver regeneration alone elevated YAP protein levels without elevating YAP mRNA levels. YAP mRNA and protein levels were both elevated in liver cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:To explore the influence of sumianxin,ketamine and sodium pentobarbital on the myoelectric motility of Sphincter of Oddi (SO).METHODS:24 adult rabbits were used in this study,and the access to the myoelectric motility recording was achieved by interposition of jejunum stump with modified Thomas method.The survived rabbits were divided into 3 groups after 10 days' recovery time,each group was anesthetized with sumianxin(n=6),ketamine(n=5),and sodium pentobarbital(n=5),respectively.Cholecystokinin (CCK,20\u3001100 ng\u00b7kg-1) was injected in conscious state and after the rabbits were completely anesthetized 5 min was recorded (the interval between CCK injections was at least 3 min).The change of myoelctric motility were recorded before and after CCK application without anaesthetics,and the enhancement of motility index and change of effective duration were evaluated.The effects of 3 anaesthetics on the myoelectric motility were compared with the conscious state before anesthesia with or without CCK application.RESULTS:In comparison with the conscious state,myoelectric motility of SO was significantly enhanced in sumianxin and ketamine group(P<0.05),but no significant change was observed in sodium pentobarbital group.Exogenous CCK stimulates the spikes of SO in all rabbits,this effect was significantly weakened by sumianxin and ketamine,whereas sodium pentobarbital totally magnified the excitation role of CCK including increased motility index and prolonged effective duration(P<0.05).CONCLUSION:All the three drugs alter the myoelectric motility of SO in rabbits,especially for sumianxin and ketamine,while sodium pentobarbital has relatively less influence.",

        "abstract": "Melting and nonisothermal crystallization behaviors of polypropylene (PP) and PP/hemp fibers (HFs) composites was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. The results show that the incorporation of HFs increases both the melting temperature (T m) and crystallization temperature (T c) of PP. Moreover, in comparison with PP/HF(70/30) composite, the addition of maleic anhydride-grafted PP (PP-MAH) results in a slight decrease in Tm but a significant increase in T c of PP. The higher T c of PP in the composites implies that HFs could act as nucleating agents for the crystallization of PP. Nonisothermal crystallization kinetics analysis was performed using Avrami and Mo models. The values of half-time (t 1/2) and rate constant indicate that the crystallization rate increases with the increasing of cooling rate for all the specimens. However, the crystallization rate of PP/HF(70/30) composite is found to be lower than that of PP at a certain cooling rate. Additionally, the composite containing PP-MAH has the lowest crystallization rate. Lower overall crystallization rate of PP/HF composites compared to PP is probably due to sufficiently high density of nuclei, which hinders the transport of PP molecular chains to crystal surface during nonisothermal crystallization. The crystallization activation energies (\u03b4E) determined by Kissinger method are 207.4 KJ/m 2, 218.5 KJ/m 2, and 220.4 kJ/m 2 for PP, PP/HF(70/30), and PP/HF/PP-MAH(70/30/5), respectively. \u00a9 2011 The Author(s) Reprints and permissions.",

        "abstract": "The motive characteristic of the sliding bubble was studied to constitute the reasonable mechanism models. The dynamic equation of the sliding bubble was established according to the analysis of the balance of forces acting on the sliding bubble in vertical flow boiling. The velocity of the sliding bubble was obtained, and the predicted results were compared with the experimental data of Maity. The predicted results of the model show that the velocity of the sliding bubble increases with extending time, but the increase of the sliding velocity of bubble decreases gradually. The velocity of the sliding bubble is higher than that of the bulk liquid when the sliding bubble lifts from the wall, which indicates that the drag force and add-mass force become the resistances from the driving forces to make the bubble slide along the wall. When the velocity of the sliding bubble is larger than that of the local liquid, the shear lift force pushes the sliding bubble against the wall, and the inertia of the liquid induced beneath the bubble due to the variation in the bubble shape probably makes the sliding bubble lift from the wall.",

The liquid-solid conjugate heat transfer in a narrow rectangular channel was numerical analyzed by using CFD code CFX. The results show that the heating concentration phenomenon can be avoided when the un-heating region of 1 mm \u00d7 2 mm near the corner is designed, and the effect of un-heating region on temperature field at the channel center is negligible. The distributions of inside wall heat flux and temperature are not uniform when heat conduction boundary condition of the solid near the un-heating region is set. The temperature of the solid in un-heating region is enhanced because of metal heat conduction, which contributes to enhance liquid temperature near the region. The effect of constant volume heat flux and constant wall heat flux on heat transfer is negligible when adiabatic boundary condition of solid near the un-heating region is set.",

Bubble growth and departure in a narrow rectangular under atmosphere pressure were visually observed by the wide and narrow side of narrow rectangular channel using high speed digital camera. There is a small interface between the bubble base and heated surface when the bubble is growing in the nucleate site, and the growing bubble shape is almost spherical. The bubble growth laws in different sites are almost uniform under the condition of the same thermal parameters, but bubble departure diameters are obvious distinct because of different sizes of nucleate sites. The bubble growth rate in a narrow rectangular channel is small, and the bubble departure time is long, the bubble growth diameter can be predicted using the amendatory Zuber expression. The effect of thermal parameters on bubble departure diameters of the mean was statistically analyzed in the camera view. Bubble departure diameters of the mean decrease with increasing heat flux, bubble departure diameters of the mean decrease with increasing inlet subcooling, and bubble departure diameters of the mean decrease with increasing bulk velocity.",

A sensitivity analysis of the difference method, interfacial force and bubble-induced turbulence and bubble size was made. The method of using the CFD code for prediction of sub-cooled boiling flow in a pipe was established. The predicted lateral distributions of void fraction showed excellent agreement with the measurements at low void fraction, but somewhat larger difference at higher void fraction in vertical upward sub-cooled boiling flow. The predicted lateral distributions of vapor velocity and bubble diameter were not satisfactory. The results showed that a reasonable bubble diameter model and modeling of bubble coalescence and tearing would be necessary for improving calculation accuracy.",

        "abstract": "From Heider's proposed attribution theory in 1958 until now, attribution theory is a hot spot of social psychology all the time. In the history of attribution theory studies, numerous attribution theories have been proposed, and the most representative and widely-influenced attribution theories include: Heider's two-dimensional theory; Keller's variance analysis theory; Rotter's control point theory, etc. Above- mentioned theories have the following characteristics: That pay great attention to details, but there is not enough stress on the human psychology's total perspective. This paper tries to use a new angle of view-orientation research to deal with the previous attribution theory research, and to construct an attribution orientation theory which is combined with social situation more closely and more generally. The presumptive model of attribution orientation theory has four dimensions: social orientation, individual orientation, active orientation and negative orientation. According to the above-mentioned construction, we formed our attribution orientation scale. In ShenZhen, our evaluators rate 1301 subjects with the attribution orientation scale, Dealing with data by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis method. Results showed the existence of such a theoretical construction. In attribution orientation's theoretical construction, factors load and fitting index of each dimension is good, and attribution orientation scale had good reliability and construction validity. At the beginning of attribution orientation's theory construction, theory supposition was set to 4 orientation dimensions respectively independence. This supposition has obtained the support of EFA\u3001CFA result and the correlation analysis result. Through the subscales score's operation, we expanded the application space of attribution orientation scale. This scale estimated that this scale is estimated to produce obvious application value in social psychology and management psychology domain, such as talent selection, talent appointment, talent evaluation, talent supervision, career planning, individual psychological healthy and the social adaptation. After inspecting the relationship between Attribution orientation dimensions and 8 social psychological variables, the following characters of four attribution orientation dimensions have been confirmed: generalizability, stability and effectiveness for evaluation.",

The result of the research suggests that: (a) in MSCEIT V2.0, there is an empirically theoretical structure which is widely different from the theoretical structure of EI in 1997; (b) the empirically theoretical structure of MSCEIT V2.0 is stable in the congeneric researches; and (c) several other aspects of this empirically theoretical structure, such as constructional preciseness, reasonable hierarchy, empirical scientificity and validity of variables, are all much better than the theoretical structure in 1997.

        "abstract": "This article,probed into the well-being views from a new perspective:psychological orientation research,and constructed the well-being views orientation theory which is high generalized and linked with social situation.After reading the literatures about well-being views,we found that previous researches has some characteristics as follows:(1) They emphasized using the viewpoints of some certain school to command the whole well-being views study,such as the naturalism well-being views,utilitarianism well-being views and etc.(2) Generally speaking,they concerned about the local and micro view of factors of well-being,including wellbeing goals, well-being means and etc.(3) The research results generated were depth and detail.However,there are some limitations;(1) the research view is unitary although there are so any schools,contents are overlapping,and the relation of variables is fuzzy.(2).The previous studies emphasized on the theoretical reclassification while ignoring to study the well-being view linked with the social situations. (3) The effect of theory is better than that of application,resulting in application of research results are not significant.In order to compensate for these shortcoming,and expand the horizons of well-being view researches,to make the research is much closer to society,so as to enhance the application of research results of well-being views,this article attempts to construct a new theory frame of well-being view,namely,well-being orientation theory.The theory is composed of four orientations,namely,social orientation,individual orientation, positive orientation and negative orientation.A scale was developed according to the theory of well-being views orientation.This article used the questionnaire on 1056 subjects and verified the theoretic model by exploratory factor analysis(EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis(CFA).This article was succeed in showing the existence of psychological orientation of well-being views.The structure of the theory includes four orientations:individual-oriented conceptions of subjective well-being,social oriented conceptions of subjective well-being,positive- oriented conceptions of subjective well-being,negative-oriented conceptions of subjective well-being.The factor loadings and the fit indices are fine.The full-scale internal consistency reliability is.853 and full-scale three-week interval test-retest reliability is.810.Furthermore,the result of exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis indicates that the whole scale has good reliability and validity.The RMSEA is.045,CFI and NNFI is both.92.All this shows that the scale not only can be used as the empirical research tool of verification of the theory of psychological oriented conceptions of subjective well-being,but also can be used to evaluate the level of personal well-being concept.",

        "abstract": "In this paper,the error distribution of the frequency correcting value by the general phase difference correcting methods is studied.It is discovered that the frequency error is not even in the whole frequency interval and the frequency error near the 1/2 frequency interval is bigger than others.There is a peak on the frequency error curve near the 1/2 frequency interval.To solve this problem,then the weighting phase difference correcting methods on discrete spectrum is proposed and simulated.Since not only the main peak spectrum line but also the second peak spectrum line is considered in some radio. In this method,the frequency errors figured out by the main peak spectrum line and the second peak spectrum line are weighted average by the amplitude ratio of the two spectrum lines.Then the amplitude error and the phase error can be figured out by the frequency error and the windows function.The new methods can effectively stabilize the peak in the error distribution of the general phase difference correcting methods appeared far away the spectrum line.Thus the new methods further improved the accuracy of the correcting frequency and the noise immunity of the algorithm.In addition,the applicable region of the methods is discussed,which is the region near the 1/2 frequency interval.Through the correcting threshold the applicable region can be restricted,in order to improve correcting accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The Kaiser effect (KE) point where there is a substantial increase in acoustic emission (AE) is to be determined for the evaluation of the in-situ stress by using rock AE tests. However it is hard to get the point accurately by means of the graphing method. A comprehensive method is proposed based on the theoretical and experimental analyses. First, we can get the approximate KE point by projecting the tangent at the turning point of the AE activity curve although it is not very accurate. Second, the relevant fractal dimensions of AE energy in the whole AE tests are calculated by using the G-P algorithm. One of the points with the minimum value of the relevant fractal dimension adjacent to the approximate KE point is taken as the final KE point and its corresponding stress is the value of the pre-stress. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in-situ stress experiments are carried out by means of the overcoring stress relief method. The rock cores are obtained from boreholes used in the overcoring stress relief method. And the pre-stress of rock core specimens along the loading direction is determined. AE tests on the 11 rock specimens are carried out. The results indicate that it has higher accuracy in estimation of the pre-stress by using the proposed comprehensive method compared with the graphing method. It can be used as a new method in the evaluation of pre-stress in AE tests.",

Meanwhile, the sensitivity of creep parameters to the stress level is studied. Results show that the numerical value of E H and \u03b7 vary little at different loading stress levels, and E K is very sensitive to the change of loading stress level. The proposed creep model for backfill is developed with the software FLAC 3D; and it has been used to numerically simulate multi-stage loading on cemented backfill.

According to the formula ultrasonic velocity characterization with different homogeneity indices under uniaxial compression is analyzed. As the homogeneity index increases, the ultrasonic velocity decline rate increases. This conclusion coincides with numerical test of rock acoustic emission (AE). Regression analysis between rock ultrasonic velocity and strain is carried out based on the test results of rock under uniaxial compression. From the above point of view, the regression equation between rock ultrasonic velocity and strain which is of comparatively high accuracy, is obtained. And it reveals that the established formula is reliable. Kaiser effect of AE will appears when ultrasonic velocity declines obviously according to the discussion of the relationship between ultrasonic velocity and AE during the deformation of rock under uniaxial compression. So the result is helpful to research in-situ stress measurement using Kaiser effect of AE under uniaxial compression.",

        "abstract": "All stopes in the-240 m level of a copper mine were recycled some years ago,but there still remains a large horizontal and residual pillar now,which can supply 842 000 t of mine.If we want a safe recovery of it,we must monitor the stability of the whole pillar all the time.Taking a part of the horizontal pillar which locates in the medium level as study object,we will use the combine method,photoelastic stressmeter observation and acoustic emission testing in detection of stability of the pillar: we can knowabout the distribution of ground stress field by the changes of the fringe pattern of photoelastic stressmete and judge whether the pillar is in stable phase after analysing various parameters of acoustic emission.Then the stability of the pillar can be evaluated reasonably after the two kinds of information being compared in the same coordinate by coupled analyzing,and the pillar instability can be predicted.Practice shows that predictions match the site constructions well,which means that the technology plays a significant role in guiding the similar mine.",

        "abstract": "The stability of roof is the main factor to determine the roadway section size in the underhand slice stoping with cemented filling method. The failure modes,deformation characteristics of cemented tailings backfill roof and mechanical characteristics of reinforcement are studied by similarity simulation and in situ monitoring according to the actual conditions of Wushan copper mine. The experiment of similarity simulation indicates that the failure mode of roof is not affected by the arrangement of reinforcement in the cemented tailings backfill. And in comparison with the horizontal arrangement of reinforcement,the vertical arrangement is more helpful to enhance the overall stability of roof. In situ strain monitoring results show that the distribution of strain state of filling body roof is more complicated compared with the computation result of simply supported beam. In vertical direction,filling body roof is tensile strain. However,tensile and compression strains alternate with the mining process in horizontal and along roadway direction. Relationship between load on reinforcement and time is obtained by monitoring results of 24 reinforcement metres. According to the mechanical characteristics of reinforcement with the mining process,the process could be divided into four stages: i.e. initial tensile stage,relatively stable stage,alternant stage of tensile and compressive states and the bearing stage. In the bearing stage,reinforcements in the roof bear against the maximum compression before roadway is mined. And after the roadway under the roof has been mined out,reinforcements bear the maximum load of tension and show suspension action. The maximum tensional area lies in the crossing roadway roof.",

First, based on the above testing results, the energy distribution of acoustic emission signals is studied by means of the wavelet packet analysis technique; and regularity of energy distributions for different frequency bands is analyzed. The results show that the energy percentage of dominant frequency band at Kaiser point is significantly higher than other points. Then, relevant fractal dimensions of acoustic emission process are obtained by using G-P algorithm. Results show that the acoustic emission process is of obvious fractal characteristics. And the minimum value of relevant fractal dimension is at Kaiser point. The conclusion can be used to identify the characteristics at Kaiser point by waveform analysis.",

The decay processes of the red long persistent phosphorescence at 693 nm emission exhibit strong behavior of f-d band of Eu2+, indicating the occurrence of energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Cr3+. Lifetime measurements of the blue band show that the energy transfer rates increase with the increase of the Cr 3+ concentration. There are several phases observed in the strontium aluminates. Energy transfer occurs only for the Eu2+ and Cr 3+ ions that located in the same phase in the host. In SrAl 12O19 phase, the Eu2+ ions emit blue light centered at 400 nm and prefer to transferring energy to the Cr3+ that yields 688 nm emission, while in the Sr2Al6O 11 and Sr4Al14O25 phases, the Eu2+ ions emit at 460 and 490 nm, respectively, and transfer the energy to the Cr3+ ions that give emission at 693 nm. It is found that the persistent phosphorescence only consists of the 490 and 693 nm bands, indicating the dominant contribution to the phosphorescence is from the ions in the Sr4Al14O25 phase. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Due to a unique electronic state at the top of the valence band, Lu2O3 based materials exhibit intense upconversion luminescence involving 1G 4 \u2192 3H6 of Tm3+ in blue, ( 2H11/2, 4S3/2) \u2192 4I15/2 in green and 4F9/2 \u2192 4I15/2 in red of Er3+ upon near infrared excitation at 980 nm.

        "abstract": "We report the long-lasting bluish-green phosphorescence for X-ray or cathode ray tubes in the phosphors with compositions of either Ba2 SiO4:0.01 Eu2+ -x Si3 N4 (x=0-1) or 2 BaCO3 -y Si3 N4:0.01 Eu2+ (y=1/6-1) synthesized by a solid-state reaction. By tuning the Si3 N4 content, the phosphorescence may originate from Eu2+ in BaSi2 O2 N2 (peaking at 490 nm), Ba 2 SiO4 (505 nm), and Ba3 SiO5 (590 nm) phases. The strong phosphorescence of the Ba2 SiO4: Eu2+ phase in 2 BaCO3 -y Si3 N4:0.01 Eu2+ is attributed to N substitution for O to generate a shallow trap. In Ba2 SiO4:0.01 Eu2+ -x Si3 N 4, however, N prefers reacting with Ba2 SiO4 to form BaSi2 O2 N2, thereby exhibiting a strong phosphorescence of the BaSi2 O2 N2: Eu 2+ phase but a weak phosphorescence of the Ba2 SiO 4: Eu2+ phase. \u00a9 2009 The Electrochemical Society.",

The emission spectra depending on temperature under 325 nm excitation by laser indicated that there exist energy transfer between VO43- group and Eu3+ ion. Under 147 nm excitation, the most intense emission peaks of commercial (Y,Gd)BO3 :Eu3+ phosphor range around 593 nm, and those of Y(P, V)O4, :Eu3+ phosphors prepared by coprecipitation reaction ranged around 619 nm.

        "abstract": "The luminescent properties of concentration dependence are reported in BaMg2 Si2 O7: Eu2+, Mn2+ red phosphor. It is observed that the broad red emission of Mn2+ consists of two bands, located at 620 and 675 nm, respectively, which are attributed to two different Mn2+ centers [Mn2+ (I) and Mn2+ (II)] substituting for two nonidentical Mg2+ sites [Mg2+ (I) and Mg2+ (II)] in the host. It is also found that the relative emission intensity of the Mn2+ (II) to the Mn2+ (I) increases with increasing Mn2+ concentration, leading to a red-shift of the overall emission. A detail analysis on the energy transfer from Eu2+ to the two Mn2+ centers is presented, which indicates that the number ratio of Mn2+ (II) to Mn2+ (I) increases with increasing Mn2+ concentration. This result is interpreted by the preferential formation of Mn2+ (I) substituting for Mg2+ (I) site. Based on energy transfer, the emission intensity ratios of Mn2+ (I) to Eu2+ and Mn2+ (II) to Eu2+, which is Mn2+ concentration dependent, are calculated using related fluorescence lifetimes. The calculated results are in good agreement with that obtained experimentally in the emission spectra. \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics.",

The excitation spectrum of Ca8Zn(SiO4)4Cl 2:Eu2+ shows an intense excitation band in the blue centered at 450 nm and emits with a maximum at 505 nm. The concentration quenching mechanism is studied and verified to be the energy transfer among the nearest-neighbor ions. Upon 450 nm excitation, the emission intensity of Ca 8Zn(SiO4)4Cl2:Eu2+ is much stronger than the green emitting Ca3SO4Cl 2:Eu2+ phosphor and even higher than YAG:Ce3+. This excitation spectrum range matches UV and blue light-emitting diodes (LEDS) chips very well, suggesting Ca8Zn(SiO4)4Cl 2:Eu2+ could be a promising green emitting phosphor candidate for LED devices. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The morphology of the TTF coordination polymers is readily tuned by the variation of metal ions. Upon incorporation of Pb(2+) and Zn(2+) ions, one-dimensional (1D) wirelike microstructures and spherical polymer particles were achieved, respectively. These results indicate that the coordinative approach pursued in this work, in which the building blocks of 1 are linked in a coordination polymer chain by association with metal ions, is an efficient and versatile approach to produce more mechanically robust micro- and nanometer-sized coordination polymer materials. More interestingly, the neutral coordination polymers are conductive and magnetic at room temperature without external manipulation. Such conductivity is reminiscent of the behavior of the neutral conductive TTF in single crystals.",

        "abstract": "Green-emitting phosphor YPO 4 :Tb used in a PDP was prepared by two different methods, i.e., conventional solid-state reaction route and solution-based co-precipitation route. Results indicated that in solution-based co-precipitation route, a lower temperature was required, no grinding and milling processes were introduced, and the starting materials were mixed at molecular level, compared with conventional solid-state reaction route. Therefore, the phosphor particles obtained from solution-based co-precipitation route had several advantages in the morphology, such as excellent surface quality, almost spherical shape, narrow size distribution, and homogeneous composition. The excitation spectrum measurement showed that YPO 4 hosts had high energy absorption in VUV range, which makes it possible that YPO 4 :Tb phosphors are used in a PDP. The emission spectrum of YPO 4 :Tb under 147 nm excitation indicated that the phosphor powders obtained from solution-based co-precipitation route had high luminance since they have excellent morphologies and homogeneous composition, compared with those obtained from conventional solid-state reaction route.",

        "abstract": "Cr3+ singly doped and Eu2+, Cr3+ co-doped SrAl12O19 nano-rods with different diameters have been prepared by a combustion method. A new emission band of Cr3+ centered at 704 nm on the low energy side of the R-line at 688 nm originating from the 2E-4A2 transition of Cr3+ is observed. This band enhances with decreasing diameter of the nano-rods, implying its origin in the Cr3+ ions on the surface of the nano-rods. Photoluminescence study and fluorescence lifetime measurements demonstrate efficient energy transfer from Eu2+ to Cr3+ in SrAl 12O19 nano-rods in comparison with the corresponding bulk materials. This result is attributed to a large spectral overlap between the Eu2+ emission band and the 4A2- 4T1 (F) absorption band of Cr3+ on the surface of the nano-rods. \u00a9 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The effects of flux and Eu concentration on the crystal structure, morphology and luminescent properties of the phosphors were investigated. The results showed that non-agglomeration phosphors with regular morphology and fine size were produced after the mixture being calcined at 800 \u2103 for 4h with 3% NH4F as flux. The main emission peak of the samples is at 613 nm. The excitation spectrum showed that this phosphor can be effectively excited by ultraviolet (UV)(395 nm) and blue (465 nm) light, nicely fitting in with the widely applied output wavelengths of ultraviolet or blue LED chips. The \u03b1-Gd2(MoO4)3 phosphor may be a good candidate phosphor for solid state lighting application.",

It is found that the addition of Lu leads to the enhancement of red fluorescence and phosphorescence at 615 nm originating from 1D2\u21923H4 transition of Pr3+, following the increase of the lifetime for the 1D2 state. As a result, it is indicated that the non-radiative centers for the 1D2 state are suppressed by the addition of Lu ions. The persistent time of the afterglow is observed to increase from less than 15 min to over 2 h after the addition of 5 mol% Lu2O3.

        "abstract": "Cubic Lu2O3:Eu3+ nanorods, nanosheets, and nanoparticles are synthesized by a hydrothermal approach by adjusting the pH values of the precursor solutions. The unique luminescence properties of the nanocrystals are presented by the appearances of a long tail at: the long-wavelength side of the charge transfer band (CTB), a novel 7F0-5D0 broad line, and the enhanced 624 nm emission line. The observed phenomena are more obvious with decreasing sample size in the order of nanorods > nanosheets > nanoparticles. Based on the experimental results of the thermal diffusion processes of Eu 3+ from, the surface to the inside of Lu2O3 particles, we conclude that the unique luminescence properties of the nanocrystals originate from the surface Eu3+. By the spectral decomposition, we obtain the excitation spectra of the interior Eu3+ and the surface Eu3+ of nanocrystals. In comparison with the bulk sample, the CTB of the interior Eu3+ presents an obvious blue shift due to the size confinement effects, while that of the surface Eu3+ shows a prominent red shift due to the distorted surface environments. The shorter lifetimes of the surface Eu3+ compared to that of the interior Eu3+ further indicate the distorted local environments on the surface of the nanocrystals. The shifts and the broadening of the CTB in Eu3+-doped nanocrystals can be well understood by the interior Eu3+ and the surface Eu3+. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Y2O3\u2236Ln nanocrystals with different Ln3+(Ln=Eu or Tb) doping concentrations and average sizes were prepared by chemical self-combustion. And the bulk materials of corresponding doping concentrations were obtained by annealing at high temperature. The emission spectra, excitation spectra and X-ray diffraction spectra of Y2O3\u2236Ln nanocrystals and bulk materials were measured. The research indicated that under the effect of quantum confinement effect and surface effect, the Y2O3\u2236Eu charge transfer band red-shifted clearly while the particle size decreased. Furthermore, the charge transfer band of the small size particles (8 nm) clearly broadened towards the long wavelength, this was attributed to the increase of the amount of Eu3+ ions existing in low crystallization degree environment close to the surface. The study also indicated that the shape of excitation peaks (bands) corresponding to the 4f5d transition absorption of Tb3+ in the excitation spectra of Y2O3\u2236Tb nanocrystals changed a lot with the variety of the particle size. This is because that the Tb3+ ions exist in two very different local environments:the low crystallization degree environment close to the surface and the high crystallization degree environment inner the particles. The absorption peaks of 4f5d transition were diffe-rent in the two environments. The Tb3+ ions ratio in the two environments changs with the variety of the particle size. So the intensity of corresponding excitation peaks (bands) changed and the shapes of the excitation spectra changed. By comparing the excitation spectra of different doping concentrations, it can be found that with the increase of Tb3+(or Eu3+ ) concentrations, the relative strength of the Y2O3 exciton transition absorption excitation peak to the 4f5d transition (or charge transfer band) excitation peak decreased. The excitation efficiency of Y2O3 exciton absorption band is very low when the doping concentrations of the luminescent centers were higher. But the excitation efficiency of Y2O3 exciton absorption band increased when the doping concentrations were quite low.",

Polarized absorption and unpolarized fluorescence spectra of Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ in GdVO 4 crystals were measured. The Judd\u2013Ofelt (JO) model was applied to obtain the three phenomenological intensity parameters. For Tm 3+ , \u03a9 2 = 8.16 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 4 = 2.45 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 6 = 0.98 \u00d7 10 \u221220 (with dimension of cm 2 ). For Ho 3+ \u03a9 2 = 1.51 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 4 = 1.61 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 6 = 1.22 \u00d7 10 \u221220 (with dimension of cm 2 ). The radiative probabilities, radiative lifetimes, and branch ratios of Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ in GdVO 4 crystals were then determined.

Keywords A1. Polarized absorption A1. Doping A2. Czochralski method B1. Thulium compounds B3. Solid state lasers B3. Eye-safe laser 1 Introduction In recent years, most of the interest in luminescent rare-earth ions have concentrated on trivalent thulium and holmium and in particular the emission bands around 2 \u03bcm (Tm: 3 F 4 \u2212 3 H 6 , Ho: 5 I 7 \u2212 5 I 8 ) [1\u20133] . The 2 \u03bcm laser emission operates in the eye-safe spectral region and generates a great interest in many fields like optical communications, coherent laser radar, and medical instrumentation. Among the laser sources, those based on solid-state materials now represent the main area of development because of their reliability and compactness. Despite of the success however, key problems still remain. These include severe dependence on pump diode temperature control due to the relatively narrow Tm absorption bands in YAG and YLF. Therefore, cooling to sub-zero temperatures is often required. The use of GdVO 4 as host crystal offers possible solutions to these problems, since the absorption cross-section of thulium in GdVO 4 is considerably stronger and broader than in YAG. Thus, the spectrum is shifted closer to the emission wavelength of commercially available AlGaAs laser diodes. Several articles have recently appeared on growth and characterization of Tm 3+ :GdVO 4 crystal [4,5] . However, no detailed analysis of Judd\u2013Ofelt theory has been performed on Tm 3+ or Ho 3+ doped GdVO 4 crystals. In this paper, we reported the spectroscopic properties of Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ in GdVO 4 crystals. In order to give a reliable optical transition intensity parameters, the polarized absorption spectra data are needed. We have measured the polarized absorption spectra of Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ doped GdVO 4 . By using the polarized absorption spectra the Judd\u2013Ofelt parameters were obtained. Consequently, the optical transition properties such as oscillator strengths, radiative transition probabilities and radiative lifetime as well as branch ratios were estimated. Finally, the stimulated emission cross-sections for some transitions of Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ in GdVO 4 were derived. 2 Experimental Tm 3+ : GdVO 4 and Ho 3+ : GdVO 4 crystals with good optical quality were grown by Czochralski technique method. Some preparative details of these crystals have been reported in Refs. [6\u20139] . The samples were cut along perpendicular or parallel crystal axis directions and well polished for the convenience of spectral measurements. Based on the distribution coefficient and the dopant concentration in the melt, the samples contained approximately 2 wt.% Tm 3+ or Ho 3+ . The corresponding ion concentration of Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ were determined to be Ho: 3.887 \u00d7 10 20 ions/cm 3 , Tm: 3.804 \u00d7 10 20 ions/cm 3 . The absorption spectra for both \u03c0 and \u03c3 polarization were measured at room temperature with a Shumandzu\u29f9UV\u29f93101PC double beam spectrophotometer in the range 345\u20132500 nm. The unpolarized fluorescence spectra of Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ were obtained under excitation at 808 nm (AlGaAs laser-diode) and 488 nm (argon laser), respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Absorption spectra The polarized absorption spectra of Tm 3+ (Ho 3+ ) in GdVO 4 crystals measured at room temperature are shown in Fig. 1 , where the absorption bands are attributed to the transitions from the ground state 3 H 6 of Tm 3+ and 5 I 8 of Ho 3+ to the corresponding excited states of Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ . The polarization spectrum of Tm 3+ at 0.8 \u03bcm shows the most highest absorption cross-section and the Full Width and Half Maximum (FWHM) of 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u221220 cm 2 and 14 nm, respectively (for \u03c3 polarization spectrum) and of 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u221220 cm 2 and 15 nm (for \u03c0 polarization spectrum, respectively). Tm 3+ doped GdVO 4 crystals has larger FWHM and moderate absorption cross-section as compared to other Tm 3+ doped crystals [10\u201313] and is suitable for AlGaAs laser pumping. 3.2 Judd\u2013Ofelt calculation and optical transition Nowadays the Judd\u2013Ofelt theory in its formulation uses three host dependent parameters \u03a9 2 , \u03a9 4 and \u03a9 6 per rare earth ion/host combination to predict the electric dipole oscillator strengths of all radiative transitions. In this theory, the electric dipole line strengths S ed are given by (1) S ed = \u2211 \u03bb = 2 , 4 , 6 \u03a9 \u03bb | \u3008 f N \u03c8 J | U ( \u03bb ) | f N \u03a8 \u2032 J \u2032 \u3009 | 2 , where \u3008 f N \u03c8J \u2223 U ( \u03bb ) \u2223 f N \u03a8\u2032 J \u2032\u3009 are the reduced matrix elements of the unit tensor operator U of \u03bb which are calculated from the tables of Nielson and Koster [14] . The line strength for magnetic dipole (md) transitions between J and J \u2032 manifolds is given by (2) S md = h 2 16 \u03c0 2 m 2 c 2 | \u3008 f N \u03c8 J \u2016 L + 2 S \u2016 f N \u03a8 \u2032 J \u2032 \u3009 | 2 Eqs. (1) and (2) are used to calculate the oscillator strength f calc by following equation: (3) f calc = 8 \u03c0 2 mcv 3 h ( 2 J + 1 ) ( x ed S ed + x md S md ) , where \u03c5 is the frequency of the transition, J is the total angular momentum of the ground state. x ed = ( n 2 + 2) 2 /9 n and x md = n , the electric and magnetic local field correction factors with the index of refraction n . From the absorption spectra the integral over each absorption band can give the experimental oscillator strength of the appropriate absorption transition. (4) f exp = mc 2 \u03c0 e 2 N \u0393 , where N is the Tm 3+ or Ho 3+ concentration, \u0393 is the integrated absorbance for each absorption band. Because GdVO 4 crystal belongs to anisotropy uniaxial crystals, it has two polarized absorption spectra, \u03c3 spectrum and \u03c0 spectrum. According to the equation, f exp \u03c0 + 2 f exp \u03c3 = f calc \u03c0 + 2 f calc \u03c3 the experimental line strength can be expressed in the following term [15] . (5) S exp = 3 h ( 2 J + 1 ) c 8 \u03c0 3 Nve 2 \u0393 \u03c0 + 2 \u0393 \u03c3 x ed \u03c0 + 2 x ed \u03c3 - x md \u03c0 + 2 x md \u03c3 x ed \u03c0 + 2 x ed \u03c3 S md , where x ed \u03c0 , \u03c3 = ( n \u03c0 , \u03c3 2 + 2 ) / 9 n \u03c0 , \u03c3 , x md \u03c0 , \u03c3 = n \u03c0 , \u03c3 is the Lorentz local-field correction for \u03c0 spectrum ( \u03c3 spectrum), and \u0393 \u03c0, \u03c3 is the integrated absorbance for \u03c0 spectrum ( \u03c3 spectrum). By a least-square fitting, the Judd\u2013Ofelt parameters for Ho 3+ and Tm 3+ in GdVO 4 crystals were calculated to be \u03a9 2 = 8.16 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 4 = 2.45 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 6 = 0.98 \u00d7 10 \u221220 for Tm 3+ and \u03a9 2 = 1.51 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 4 = 1.61 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 6 = 1.22 \u00d7 10 \u221220 for Ho 3+ (all with dimension of cm 2 ). Tm 3+ :GdVO 4 crystal has larger J\u2013O parameters \u03a9 \u03bb ( \u03bb = 2,4,6) as compared to other doped crystals (see Table 1 ). As known that \u03a9 2 is very sensitive to the structure and it is associated with the asymmetry and covalency of the lanthanide sites. The larger \u03a9 2 value indicates the stronger covalence characteristics of this crystal. The values of the J\u2013O parameters are useful to calculate the spectroscopic quality factor X = \u03a9 4 / \u03a9 6 which is critically important in predicting the stimulated emission for the laser active medium. The spectroscopic quality factor of Tm 3+ :GdVO 4 crystal is 2.5 which is close to that of LiTaO 3 , KYb(WO 4 ) 2 , YAG, and larger than of other crystals listed in Table 1 . This relatively high X value indicates that Tm:GdVO 4 is a promising material for efficient laser action. The experimental and theoretical oscillator strengths for the Ho 3+ , Tm 3+ doped GdVO 4 crystals were calculated and listed in order to check the correctness in the J\u2013O calculations (see Table 2 ). It can be seen that the experimental and theoretical oscillator strengths are each other in a reasonable agreement. The calculated values of the rms deviations are 8 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 for Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ doped crystal, respectively. These rms are smaller than the oscillator strengths listed in Table 2 and comparable with the values for other calculations [8,11] , Thus, we are able to assert that the calculations are reliable. The radiative transition probabilities, lifetime, and transition branch ratios are important dynamic parameters for trivalent rare earth ions and could be expressed by the formulas: A JJ \u2032 = 64 \u03c0 4 e 2 v 3 3 h ( 2 J + 1 ) ( x ed \u2032 S ed + x md \u2032 S md ) , \u03c4 = 1 \u2211 J \u2032 A JJ \u2032 and \u03b2 JJ \u2032 = A JJ \u2032 \u03c4 , where A JJ \u2032 is the radiative transition probability from level J to level J \u2032, \u03c4 is the lifetime of level J , and \u03b2 JJ \u2032 is the branch ratios for the transitions originating from level J . Based on these formulas, the calculated values of partial transitions for Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ in GdVO 4 are listed in Table 3 (a) and (b). The corresponding Judd\u2013Ofelt parameters and reduced matrix were involved in the calculations. 3.3 Emission cross-section The emission cross-section is a very important parameter for measuring laser materials. The emission cross-section can be obtained from the spectroscopic data by two commonly applied methods, i.e., by the reciprocity method and by Fuchtbauer\u2013Ladenburg (FL) formula. Using the FL formula, the emission cross-section can be expressed in the following terms (6) \u03c3 em = \u03bb 0 4 AI ( \u03bb 0 ) 8 \u03c0 cn 2 \u222b I ( \u03bb ) d \u03bb , where A is the spontaneous radiative emission probabilities, \u03bb 0 is the peak wavelength, n is the refractive index of the host material. Another approach for determining the emission cross section is the reciprocity method in which the ground state absorption cross-section \u03c3 abs is associated and can be functionally expressed as below, while assuming that the Stark level positions of both multiplets are known, (7) \u03c3 em ( \u03bb ) = \u03c3 abs ( \u03bb ) Z l Z u exp E ZL - hc / \u03bb k B T , where \u03c3 abs = a / N is the absorption cross-section N is the dopant concentration, Z l and Z u are the partition function of lower and upper levels, respectively, E ZL is the energy between the lowest Stark levels of the multiplets involved. Fig. 2 shows the unpolarized room temperature emission spectra of Ho 3+ excited at 488 nm. It consists of four emission peaks corresponding to the 5 F 3 \u2192 5 I 8 , ( 5 F 4 , 5 S 2 ) \u2192 5 I 8 , 5 F 5 \u2192 5 I 8 , ( 5 F 4 , 5 S 2 ) \u2192 5 I 7 transitions, which are in agreement with the reports [21,22] . In this figure the NIR emission( 5 F 4 , 5 S 2 ) \u2192 5 I 7 is stronger than that of the yellow-green ( 5 F 4 , 5 S 2 ) \u2192 5 I 8 . The green emission has been considered to be a laser operating level and its cross-section is obtained by FL method (see the insert in the Fig. 2 ). The emission cross-section value is 1.83 \u00d7 10 \u221220 cm 2 at 545 nm, which is larger. This may make the Ho 3+ doped GdVO 4 to be a suitable host material for green laser operation under upconversion or downcoversion pump. The blue emission of Tm 3+ : 1 G 4 \u2192 3 H 6 was measured by using an upconversion technique upon 808 nm excitation. The luminescent intensity was too weak for the used collection and detection system in our lab when excited at higher level than 1 G 4 . Probably it is due to the pumping wavelength which is unmatched and the intrinsic concentration quenching of Tm 3+ . However, when we used 808 nm LD excitation (laser diode, with watt level output), the emission from the upper level is strong enough. Based on the upconversion emission spectra data and the FL formula, the stimulated emission cross section was estimated and plotted in Fig. 3 as curve (a). On the aim at a comparison the stimulated emission cross-section was derived also from the absorption cross-section (curve (c)) and shown as curve (b). Obviously, the emission cross-sections obtained from various routes are very similar. The difference between line shape is due to the deviation of the spectra measurement system. The emission cross-section at highest intensity is around 0.4 \u00d7 10 \u221220 cm 2 . 3 H 4 \u2192 3 F 4 transition of Tm 3+ at around 1500 nm has been widely considered to be a useful wavelength for the applications in biomedicine and optical communication. The stimulated emission cross-section corresponding to the 3 H 4 \u2192 3 F 4 transitions of Tm 3+ was estimated by FL method in order to evaluate the spectral performance of the Tm 3+ doped GdVO 4 as a laser material (see Fig. 4 ). Nine distinct emission peaks belonging to the transitions between 3 H 4 and 3 F 4 Stack splits are observed. The emission cross-section \u03c3 em at 1484 nm and 1472 nm is 0.85 \u00d7 10 \u221220 cm 2 and 0.79 \u00d7 10 \u221220 cm 2 , respectively. 4 Conclusion Tm 3+ -, Ho 3+ -doped GdVO 4 crystals with good optical properties were grown successfully by Czochralski method. The polarized absorption spectra were measured and the standard Judd\u2013Ofelt procedure was accomplished for these crystals. To our best knowledge, we obtained the Tm 3+ -, Ho 3+ -doped GdVO 4 by using the polarized absorption spectra for the first time. The J\u2013O parameters for Ho 3+ are \u03a9 2 = 1.51 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 4 = 1.61 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 6 = 1.22 \u00d7 10 \u221220 and for Tm 3+ are \u03a9 2 = 8.16 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 4 = 2.45 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , \u03a9 6 = 0.98 \u00d7 10 \u221220 (with dimension of cm 2 ). Consequently, the oscillator strengths, transition probabilities, branch ratios, and radiative lifetimes were estimated for both Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ doped GdVO 4 . The stimulated emission cross-section were derived and compared from different routes. These data would be helpful for further study on the Tm 3+ and Ho 3+ doped GdVO 4 crystals.

        "abstract": "Red emitting phosphors of CaTiO3:Pr 3+ nanoparticles with size ranging from 6 to 95 nm have been prepared by a coprecipitation technique and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The fluorescence and phosphorescence of CaTiO3:Pr 3+ nanoparticles as a function of annealing temperature are investigated. It is found that fluorescence intensities monotonously increase with increasing temperature. However, a maximum in phosphorescence with the increase of annealing temperature occurs for the sample prepared at 7001C. Based on the measurement of fluorescence emission, fluorescence excitation and reflectance spectra as well as time decay patterns of fluorescence and phosphorescence, it is demonstrated that the dependence of fluorescence and phosphorescence on annealing temperature originates from the decrease of surface defects with the increase of temperature.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we use the solution precipitation method to synthesize Tb3+-doped yttrium orthophosphate, which is a green-emission luminescent material. The evolution of hydrated yttrium orthophosphate (YPO4.2H2O) to dehydrated yttrium orthophosphate (YPO4) is observed in the heat-treatment process, simultaneously, accompanying the structural transformation from monoclinic churchite-type to tetragonal xenotime-type structure. Furthermore, the luminescent efficiency of Tb3+-doped YPO4 presents a sharp jump at a critical temperature in this heat-treatment process. Interestingly, this critical temperature is close to the structural transformation temperature. The remarkable change of luminescent efficiency seems to be related to the structural transformation. However, the FTIR and fluorescent decay measurements at 10 and 300 K indicate that the OH group is the origin of luminescent efficiency change. OH- ions with high vibration frequency provide an efficient means to quench the luminescence. The comparison of the luminescent efficiency, OH- content, and lifetime of 5D4 of Tb3+ between two samples with the same crystal structure proves that the structural transformation has no significant effect on the luminescent efficiency and lifetime. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that correctly preventing OH- ions inside the host matrix or effectively eliminating them may improve the luminescent efficiency greatly. This idea also may be applied to other optical systems.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we present a simple strategy to enhance the stability of water-sensitive SrLiAlN:Eu phosphor through embedding the phosphor particles into low-melting Sn-P-F-O glass using phosphor-in-glass (PiG) approach. After being immersed in water for 96\u202fh, the emission intensity of the SrLiAlN:Eu-PiG sample was maintained at 80% of its pristine intensity, indicating the moisture-resistance property of SrLiAlN:Eu was significantly enhanced. Employing the narrow-band red-emitting SrLiAlN:Eu-PiG sample and a blue COB (chip-on-board), a plant growing LED device was fabricated. The emission spectrum of the device matches well with the absorption of Chlorophyl (a and b) in plants, indicating the as-prepared SrLiAlN:Eu-PiG are suitable to be applied in plant lighting field. We believe that this simple method reported in this communication can be easily expanded to other water-sensitive luminescence materials.",

        "abstract": "The effects of the 4f25d configuration on the intraconfigurational electric dipole transitions of Nd3+ doped YPO4 are taken into account by a 'direct' calculation. A simple model is applied to analyze the opposite-parity 4f25d configuration admixing into 4f3 transitional states. The matrix elements of the odd-rank crystal-field interaction and the interconfigurational electric dipole transition are directly expressed using a standard tensor operator method. A set of selection rules for f-d mixing and f-f electric dipole transitions is built up. The admixture effect is considered including both explicit 4f25d configuration and other opposite-parity states such as the 4f2n \u2032g configuration which is treated by a closure procedure. Using this calculation method in combination with the experimental data from the absorption spectrum, a set of intensity parameters is obtained. The transition intensities originating from the high-lying 2G9/2(2) level to the lower energy levels are then calculated, demonstrating a good agreement with the experimental results. The new calculation method is suitable for the electric dipole transitions within the 4fN configurations of trivalent lanthanide ions with more than two f-electrons. \u00a9 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Eu~ 3+ doped Y_2O_3 nanocrystalline and bulk powders with small content of Ag~+ were prepared by chemical self-combustion. An interesting phenomenon was observed: with an increase in Ag~+ content the luminescent intensity of the nanosized crystal is enhanced at first and then maintains a stable level; however for the bulk powder there is no obvious change in the luminescent intensity when the Ag~+ content is varied. The morphology and crystal structure were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD), respectively. Emission spectra were measured for nano- and bulk samples. The fluorescence decay curves for all the samples, including nanosized and bulk ones, either with or without Ag~+, were measured. It is found that the lifetime for the nanosized sample with Ag~+ is longer than that without Ag~+, and the lifetime for the bulk sample has no change. From these experimental results wecome to the conclusion that the Ag~+ ion may link with a surfice O~ 2- , which has a free bond, then the surfice unsaturated dangling bonds can be eliminated. The elimination of surfice dangling bonds may cause the increase of luminescence efficiency of Eu~ 3+ doped nanosized Y_2O_3.",

        "title": "Enhanced phosphorescence in N contained Ba2SiO4:Eu2+ for X-ray and cathode ray tubes",
        "abstract": "A bluish-green color long-lasting phosphorescent phosphor of N contained Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ for X-ray and cathode ray tubes are prepared with the chemical component formula Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ \u2212 x Si 3 N 4 \u2212 2BaCO 3 ( x = 0.1 to 1.0) by the conventional high-temperature solid-state method. The phosphorescence and fluorescence properties as a function of Si 3 N 4 content and temperature are investigated. The emission spectra show a single broad band peaking at 505 nm, which are ascribed to the 4f 6 5d 1 \u2192 4f 7 transition of Eu 2+ . Thermoluminescence (TL) glow-curves show that Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ without N holds a high-temperature peak at 417 K. With increasing the content of Si 3 N 4 , the phosphorescence grows super-linearly and some new TL peaks appear at low temperatures of about 400, 355, 365, and 335 K. These peaks are ascribed to the formation of new traps related to N substitution for O. Keywords Long-lasting Phosphorescence Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ X-ray Cathode ray tubes 1 Introduction Long-lasting phosphorescence (LLP) is a phenomenon that the thermally stimulate recombination of electrons and holes at traps which leave holes or electrons in a long lived excited state at room temperature, is an interesting phenomenon in which the luminescence of LLP material persists after the removal of the excitation source [1,2] . Therefore, LLP phosphors can find application in sign boards, watch dials, etc. where one can see the objects clearly even in the dark [3] . The long-lasting phosphorescence (LLP) phosphors for X-ray and cathode ray tubes (CRT) have their broad application prospect [4,5] . One of the important applications of the phosphors is for displaying radar echoes on the screen due to the long period of electron beam rotation over the screen. At present, the persistent phosphor applied in the radar tube is mainly yellow\u2013green emitting (Zn,Cd)S:Cu,Cl [6] . The persistent phosphor Zn 2 SiO 4 :Mn 2+ containing As 2 O 3 additive exhibits a green emission at 525 nm, also suitable for radar tubes that operated by random scanning [7] . Some potential LLP phosphors for X-ray or CRT such as the red emitting Y 2 O 2 S:Eu 3+ [8] and the green emitting KY 3 F 10 :Tb 3+ phosphors were also reported [9] . In our previous work, we observed bluish-green LLP in N contained Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ phosphors for X-ray or CRT excitation [10] . As we known, pure Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ is a highly efficient bluish-green emitting phosphor for application in phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes [11,12] . But its thermoluminescence (TL) glow-curve reveals that pure Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ phosphor holds a strong intrinsic TL peak at 417 K with a weak satellite peaking at 374 K. Due to high-temperature locations of the TL peaks, the filled traps in pure Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ can hardly be released at room temperature to generate bluish-green LLP. Our previous work demonstrated the preparation of N contained Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ by the convention high-temperature solid-state reaction method with the nominal composition of either Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ \u2212 x Si 3 N 4 ( x = 0.03) or 2BaCO 3 \u2212 y Si 3 N 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( y = 1/4 to 1). The modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ phosphors appear another new TL peak at low temperature of 355 K, leading to the performance of room temperature bluish-green LLP. The new TL peak is attributed to a new kind of trap related to N substitution for O site [10] . Though the strongest Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ phase LLP intensity of 2BaCO 3 \u2212 y Si 3 N 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( y = 1.0) is seven times as strong as that of Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ \u2212 x Si 3 N 4 ( x = 0.03), the observed bluish-green LLP still require to be further enhanced. In this paper, a modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ phosphor is prepared with the nominal composition of Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ \u2212 x Si 3 N 4 \u2212 2BaCO 3 ( x = 0.1 to 1.0) by solid-state reaction method. The LLP and TL properties as a function of Si 3 N 4 content are investigated. The enhanced bluish-green LLP in Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ phase is performed. 2 Experimental Powder samples were synthesized by using the convention high-temperature solid-state reaction method. A group of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x ) samples is prepared with the chemical composition of Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ \u2212 x Si 3 N 4 \u2212 2BaCO 3 ( x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0). The starting materials used in the preparation of these phosphors are BaCO 3 (analytical grade), SiO 2 (analytical grade), and Eu 2 O 3 (99.99%). The raw materials were taken in an agate mortar in stoichiometric molar ratio and were ground for 1 h, and then the dried powder mixture was loaded into alumina crucibles and was sintered at 1100\u20131300 \u00b0C for 4 h in a horizontal tube furnace under weak reductive atmosphere (5%H 2 + 95%N 2 mixed flowing gas). After slowly cooling to the room temperature, in stoichiometric molar ratio the fired product Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ was mixed with \u03b1-Si 3 N 4 (99.9%) and BaCO 3 , and then the mixtures were ground in ethanol for 1 h and were sintered again at 1300\u20131500 \u00b0C for 4 h in the same reducing gas flow as above. For comparison, the modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( y = 1.0) samples is also prepared with the chemical composition of 2BaCO 3 \u2212 Si 3 N 4 :0.01Eu 2+ . BaCO 3 and \u03b1-Si 3 N 4 were ground in ethanol for 1 h in a stoichiometric molar ratio and were sintered at 1300\u20131500 \u00b0C for 4 h in the same reducing gas flow as above. The crystal structures of all synthesized powder samples finally were checked using conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku D/M AX-2500 V) with Cu target ( \u03bb = 0.154 nm) radiation at a 0.02\u00b0 (2 \u03b8 ) scanning step. Due to the similar properties of LLP for X-ray and CRT excitation, X-ray is chosen to be an excitation source in this work. The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and emission (PL) spectra were obtained with a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a monochromator and Xe lamp as the excitation source. LLP emission spectra and the phosphorescence intensity decay curves were measured on the same Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with the X-ray operated at 40 kV and 10 mA as an excitation source and the measurements were performed after the samples were irradiated for 5 min. The thermoluminescence (TL) measurements were the same as the LLP measurements and used omega CN76000 thermostat. All measurements except TL spectra were performed at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion Modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 0.1 to 1.0) phosphors show a bluish-green light emitting peaking at 505 nm under 400 nm excitation. Fig. 1 a and b show the PLE and PL spectra of pure Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ and modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 1.0), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 , the excitation and emission spectra of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 1.0) phosphors are in accordance with those of pure Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ . The PLE spectra are in the region of 220\u2013490 nm, which are attributed to 4f 7 \u2192 4f 6 5d 1 transition of Eu 2+ and the emission spectra show a bluish-green emitting peaking at 505 nm, which are ascribed to the 4f 6 5d 1 \u2192 4f 7 transition of divalent europium [13,14] . Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0) with the standard JCPDS card No. 77-0150 for Ba 2 SiO 4 . The XRD patterns of samples are collected in the range of 20\u00b0 \u2a7d 2 \u03b8 \u2a7d 60\u00b0. It is exhibited that XRD patterns of the samples are consistent with the JCPDS card No. 77-0150 for Ba 2 SiO 4 orthorhombic phase with the Si 3 N 4 content 0.3 \u2a7d x \u2a7d 1, indicating that the samples form solid solutions. It is also found that the XRD peaks of BaCO 3 (marked with spots in Fig. 2 ) clearly appear at 23.9\u00b0 for x \u2a7d 0.2, implying the occurrence of solubility saturation because of excessive amount of BaCO 3 . However, when x > 1/3, the Si 3 N 4 content is superfluous for forming Ba 2 SiO 4 phase, but there is no diffraction peaks of Si 3 N 4 appearing in the XRD patterns. That may be due to occurrence of reacting of remanent Si 3 N 4 with formed CO to produce SiO 2 , N 2 and a small quantity of C, and then SiO 2 is reduced to be Si under reductive atmosphere. The phosphors with x \u2a7e 0.2 show an intense bluish-green LLP after irradiated by X-ray or cathode ray excitation source, but no phosphorescence can be detected in the phosphor with x \u2a7d 0.1. Fig. 3 depicts the LLP spectra of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 0.2 to 1.0, solid; y = 1.0, red dashed) detected immediately after the removal of X-ray excitation source. The LLP spectra of phosphors are completely identical with the PL spectrum of pure Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ , presenting a single broadband peaking at about 505 nm due to 4f 6 5d 1 \u2192 4f 7 transition of Eu 2+ . The phosphorescence intensity of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 1.0) is about three times as strong as that of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( y = 1.0). The LLP of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 0.2 to 1.0) are observed to be enhanced continuously with increasing Si 3 N 4 content x , as shown in the inset of Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the LLP grows super-linearly with increasing x from 0.2 to 1. Fig. 4 a shows the decay curves of phosphorescence intensity of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 0.75 and 1.0). After irradiated by X-ray source, the strong bluish-green phosphorescence of samples is observed in the dark by the naked eye. The phosphorescence intensity is 20.8 and 22.8 mcd/m 2 , respectively, for x = 0.75 and 1.0. The phosphorescence decay time with 50% intensity is 12.7s obtained from the process. The normalized decay curves of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 0.75 and 1.0) are plotted in a double logarithmic coordinate, as shown in Fig. 4 b. The decay curves approximatively fit the power law of t \u2212 n , with n \u2248 0.69 < 1. Perhaps this results from the radiative recombination of electrons and holes through tunneling and thermal hopping, as proposed by Yamaga et al. for understanding UV induced phosphorescence in Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ and Ba 3 SiO 5 :Eu 2+ [15] . We consider that N can enter into the Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ lattices to replace O to form a N O point defect. The defect or their complexes perhaps act as traps for LLP. To know the formation processes of the traps, TL glow-curves of some related phosphors are studied. Fig. 5 shows the TL glow-curves of pure Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ and modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 0.2 to 1.0; y = 1.0). The samples were mounted in the thermostat and heated up with a heating rate about 1.4 K/s in the temperature range of 300\u2013500 K after irradiated by X-ray excitation source. As shown in Fig. 5 , the pure Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ has its intrinsic TL curve that is composed of a dominant peak at 417 K with a shoulder at 374 K. Those peaks should be attributed to the intrinsic defects in the host matrix. Due to high-temperature locations, they can be hardly thermally released at room temperature to generate LLP. With adding Si 3 N 4 , the shoulder disappears at x = 0.2 and the 417 K peak reduces gradually and finally disappears at x = 0.5 in the modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x ). Instead, some new TL peaks appear successively at about 400, 355, 365, and 335 K, indicating the formation of new traps. It can be seen that these new TL peaks are included in the TL curves (red dashed) of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( y = 1.0) phosphor. For high content of Si 3 N 4 ( x > 0.5), a peak at low temperature of 335 K appears, leading to the enhancement of room temperature LLP. In the modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 0.2 to 1.0) phosphor, as the mole ratio of Si 3 N 4 /BaCO 3 is less than 1/6, Si 3 N 4 may react with BaCO 3 completely to form partial Ba 2 SiO 4 , making N atoms substitute for partial O atoms. When the mole ratio of Si 3 N 4 /BaCO 3 is more than 1/6, Si 3 N 4 is excessive for forming Ba 2 SiO 4 , resulting in more N atoms substitution for O atoms to generate more traps. The increase of the number of traps makes the distance among traps monish. Hence, it is presumed that high Si 3 N 4 content promotes two or more traps to form a complex trap, resulting in an exponential growth of LLP with increasing x . In this case, the peak at 335 K appeared for only high Si 3 N 4 content is ascribed to the complex traps. Those peaks appeared for low Si 3 N 4 content is ascribed to a single trap formed by a N 3\u2212 substitution for a O 2\u2212 . Fig. 6 shows the fluorescence emission intensities of modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ ( x = 0.3 and 1.0) as a function of temperature under excitation at 400 nm. The fluorescence intensities of phosphors decrease with the temperature increasing from 300 to 473 K. In the sample with x = 0.3, the quenching temperature at 50% of initial PL intensity is 401 K and for x = 1.0, the quenching temperature is 419 K. This means that the stability of phosphor for x = 1.0 is better than that for x = 0.3. According to the classical theory of thermal quenching, the temperature-dependent intensity can be described by the expression: (1) I ( T ) = I ( 0 ) 1 + R exp ( - \u0394 E / k B T ) where R is the frequency factor with the unit of radiative rate. \u0394 E is the activation energy and k B is the Boltzmann constant [16,17] . Using equation (1) , a good fitting result is presented in Fig. 6 . The values of \u0394 E are obtained to be 0.46 eV for x = 0.3 and 0.44 eV for x = 1.0, respectively. It is worth noting that the TL property of holding high-temperature traps implies that Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ and modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ could be materials for X-ray storage. We have observed photo-stimulated bluish-green color luminescence upon 980 nm infrared stimulation in Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ and modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ phosphor after irradiated by X-ray source. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, the enhanced bluish-green LLP of N contained Ba 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2+ is reported in this paper. The modified Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ phosphors with the chemical compositions of Ba 2 SiO 4 :0.01Eu 2+ \u2212 x Si 3 N 4 \u2212 2BaCO 3 ( x = 0.1 to 1.0) are synthesized by a two-step high-temperature solid-state reaction method under weak reductive atmosphere. The phosphors exhibit a strong bluish-green LLP when are excited under X-ray or CRT. LLP and TL properties of the phosphors after exposure of X-ray have been investigated as a function of Si 3 N 4 content. With increasing the content of Si 3 N 4 , the phosphorescence grows super-linearly and some new TL peaks appear at low temperatures of about 400, 355, 365, and 335 K. These peaks are ascribed to the formation of new traps related to N substitution for O. High Si 3 N 4 content may promote two or more traps to form a complex trap to enhance room temperature LLP. Temperature dependence of PL intensity reveals that the thermal stability of phosphors for the relative high Si 3 N 4 content is better than that for low Si 3 N 4 content.

        "abstract": "A novel blue-emitting material, fine-particle phosphor (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ , has been prepared via co-precipitation reaction. The phosphor particles were characterized by XRD, SEM, and photoluminescence under vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, 147 nm) or ultraviolet (UV, 254 nm) excitation. The XRD patterns disclosed that (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ particles calcined at 1200 \u00b0C have the highest intensity. The SEM image showed that the size of the phosphor particles is uniform and submicron, and their morphology is regular and no agglomeration found. The fine particles blue-emitting material exhibits a narrow emission peak at 475 nm and a weak broad-band around 430 nm, whose intensity is dependent on the contents of Tm 3+ and VO 4 3\u2212 . Keywords PDP phosphor Rare earth ions Luminescence Coprecipitation reaction 1 Introduction The plasma display panel (PDP) has been edged competitively in the market of large flat panel display, yet much improvement concerning the luminescent efficiency, lifetime, and color purity of the phosphors is still in need. Particularly, superior display performance of the PDP device requires further improvement in morphology, particle size, particle size distribution, luminescent efficiency, and luminescent lifetime, and stability of phosphors. Usually, the commercial PDP phosphors are produced by using the solid-state reactions at high temperature, however, it is difficult to control over the particle size and morphology, uniform dopant concentration. Compared to the conventional solid-state reaction process, some aerosol synthesis techniques such as spray pyrolysis and coprecipitation reaction have been suggested the better ways to obtain PDP phosphors provided with improved morphology and particle size. In recent years much work reported that phosphor particles with good morphology have been synthesized successfully using these aerosol synthesis techniques [1\u20134] . The commercial PDP blue-emitting phosphor BaMgAl 10 O 17 :Eu 2+ represented good enough spectral properties but its easy-aging has been puzzling researchers in practical application. In order to recognize the aging mechanism of the blue emitting phosphor BaMgAl 10 O 17 :Eu 2+ , extended investigations have been completed. Nowadays it is very clear that lattice deformation of the host and oxidation of the divalent europium ions are the main reason causing the phosphor aging [5\u20137] . Facing these aging mechanism of the blue emitting phosphor, we could propose an approach to improve phosphor performance that selecting a novel stable host, in which Eu 2+ can be stably existent and have excellent spectral properties for the PDP application. Otherwise, it is also a good idea that looking for a new luminescent center with unvaried valence to substitute for Eu 2+ . In the lanthanide series, Tm 3+ may be a feasible candidate for the blue emissions originating from 1 D 2 \u2192 3 H 4 (around 450 nm), 1 G 4 \u2192 3 H 6 (around 480 nm) transitions. The present work is a primary try for finding a novel candidate of blue emitting PDP phosphor. As for their high-energy optical absorption in VUV, yttrium orthovanadate (YVO 4 ) and yttrium orthophosphate (YPO 4 ) were selected usually as host materials [8\u201311] . Tm 3+ ion is selected as a blue-emitting activator according to its energy level and stability under the operating condition in PDP devices. The phosphor (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ particles were prepared via coprecipitation reaction. The dependence of XRD patterns on the post treatment temperature was observed. TEM photo was taken for the sample after post treatment. The emission spectra were measured under VUV excitation for the samples with different Tm 3+ concentration. The dependence of emission spectra on the post treatment temperature was observed. 2 Experimental According to a certain stoichiometric ratio, yttrium oxide (Y 2 O 3 99.99%, AR), Gadolinium oxide (Gd 2 O 3 99.99%, AR), Thulium oxide (Tm 2 O 3 99.99%, AR) and vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 99%, AR) were weighed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid. The mixture was heated and stirred in a hot beaker at 70\u201380 \u00b0C, then added another mixture of hydrogen peroxide solution (H 2 O 2 , AR), ammonia spirit (NH 4 OH, AR), diammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 , AR) solution. The precipitate was washed by de-ionized water and filtrated. Finally, the white phosphor (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 0 4 :Tm 3+ was obtained when the precipitate was dried at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h and calcined at a appropriate temperature for 2 h. The samples were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD, RIGAKU, D/MAX-II B) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.54178), scanning electron microscope (SEM, AMARY, KYKY\u20131000B), ultraviolet (UV, HITACH, F4500) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, FEXEM-SKLAO100 with VM502 monochrometer and 30 W deuterium discharge lamp) spectra. 3 Results and discussion YVO 4 and YPO 4 have the similar structure of ZrSiO 4 with slight difference in lattice parameters [12] . YVO 4 and YPO 4 can form the same solid solution [13] that can be used as luminescence host doped with Eu 3+ , Dy 3+ , etc. [9,14] . Furthermore, the structure of YVO 4 crystal has no changes when V 5+ is substituted for P 5+ partly [15] . Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ particles at different calcination temperatures. Obviously, with an increase of firing temperature, the characteristic diffraction peaks of (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 appeared. Up to 1200 \u00b0C, the enhanced diffraction peaks are observed, indicating full crystallization of (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ particles. Fig. 2 shows the SEM image of post-treated (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ phosphor particles at 1200 \u00b0C for 2 h. It can be found that the size of the phosphor particles is uniform and submicron, and the morphology is regular, no agglomeration found. In practical application the morphology and size of particles greatly affect the properties of the phosphor materials. Phosphors with regular morphology and fine size can improve the packing density, slurry properties, and make the luminescence intensity uniform [16] . From this point of view, we believe that coprecipitation reaction is, at least for (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ system, a doable preparation method for producing phosphors. Fig. 3 shows the effect of post-treatment temperature on the luminescent intensity of phosphor (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ under VUV (147 nm) excitation. The phosphor particles post-treated at 800 \u00b0C emitted little visible light. With an increase of the post-treatment temperature, the luminescent intensities of the phosphor improved gradually. A weak peak around 650 nm attributes to Tm 3+ ion transition 1 G 4 \u2192 3 H 4 . The photoluminescence intensity of the phosphor of (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ is affected by the post-treatment temperature, Tm 3+ concentration, and mean size of particles. Fig. 4 shows the dependence of the luminous intensity of phosphor (Y,Gd) 1\u2212 x Tm x P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 on the Tm 3+ concentration under UV (254 nm) excitation. There are two emission peaks for most phosphors observed, the narrow one at 475 nm originates from the Tm 3+ ion transition 1 G 4 \u2192 3 H 6 , and the weak broad-band around 430 nm belongs to VO 4 3\u2212 group. With increasing Tm 3+ concentration, the narrow peak intensity enhanced while the Tm 3+ concentration is lower than 0.0025 in mole. When the Tm 3+ concentration is higher than 0.0025, the intensity of the transition 1 G 4 \u2192 3 H 6 decreases with increasing Tm 3+ concentration. The intensity of broad-band decreases with Tm 3+ concentration in full studied concentration region. The dependence of the transition intensity for 1 G 4 \u2192 3 H 6 on Tm 3+ concentration, represented in a double-log coordinates, is shown in Fig. 5 . The integrated emission intensity is for the pure transition 1 G 4 \u2192 3 H 6 of Tm 3+ , which is obtained via multi-peak fit. A linear fit of the experimental data in the Tm 3+ concentration range between 0.0001 and 0.025 to the function, Y = A + BX , was carried out. The fitting results are shown in Fig. 5 . From the fitting result, B < 1, it can be confirmed that there exists energy transfer from 1 G 4 of Tm 3+ to some quenching centers. The intensity decrease of VO 4 3\u2212 emission spectra with Tm 3+ concentration implies the energy transfer from VO 4 3\u2212 to Tm 3+ and its rate is smaller than that from Tm 3+ to the quenching centers. This is the reason resulting in the extreme concentration quenching of Tm 3+ in accordance with the experimental observation in Fig. 5 . 4 Conclusions Blue-emitting (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ phosphor particles were prepared by coprecipitation reaction with a post-treatment process. The obtained particles have regular morphology with submicron size even after post-treated at 1200 \u00b0C for 2 h. The phosphor has an emission peak at 475 nm which is attributed to the emission from 1 G 4 to 3 H 6 . It is expected that (Y,Gd)P 0.5 V 0.5 O 4 :Tm 3+ would be a promising blue-emitting candidate for PDP or specific detector phosphor.

The phosphorescence consists of a group of blue and green emission lines originating from 5D3 \u2192 7FJ and 5D 4 \u2192 7FJ transitions of Tb3+, respectively. The phosphorescent emitting color can be tuned from blue to green by gradually increasing Tb3+ concentrations, which is attributed to the enhanced 5D3 - 5D4 relaxation through the cross relaxation between two Tb3+ ions, as described by of (5D3, 7F6) - (5D 4, 7F 0). The Tb3+ concentration dependent phosphorescence spectra are well simulated based on the analysis of luminescence dynamical processes using the Judd-Ofelt theory and rate equations concerning the 5 D3 and 5D4 levels. The energy charge and release pattern of the phosphor are presented and a 10% decay time is 29 s. The measurement of the thermoluminescence glow curve gives convincing evidence for the traps analysis. \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

It is observed that with decreasing size of the nanocrystals, the relative intensity of the upconverted red emission (Er 3+: 4F 9/2 f 4I 15/2) to the green one (Er 3+: ( 2H 11/2, 4S 3/2) f 4I 15/2) is increased, and a three-photon process involved in the green upconversion, as described by 4F 9/2(Er) + 2F 5/2 (Yb) f 2H 9/2 (Er) + 2F 7/2 (Yb), is synchronously enhanced. An analysis based on steady-state rate equations indicates that the results can be induced by a large 4I 11/2 f 4I 13/2 nonradiative relaxation rate with a small 4F 9/2 f 4I 9/2 nonradiative relaxation rate. The large 4I 11/2 f 4I 13/2 nonradiative relaxation rate is attributed to the occurrence of efficient cross energy transfer to OH - surface group due to the good energy match. As the size of the nanocrystals decreases, the relative surface area is increased, increasing the number of OH - group that can attach to the surface, therefore, enhancing the 4I 11/2 f 4I 13/2 nonradiative relaxation rate through cross energy transfer to OH - surface group. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

A broad emission spectrum composed a yellow emission band from Ce3+, a light red emission line from Pr3+ and a deep red emission line from Cr3+, which are generated through energy transfer among the dopant ions.

        "abstract": "Y2O3: Ln nanocrystals with different Ln3+ (Ln = Eu or Tb) doping concentrations and average sizes were prepared by chemical self-combustion. And the bulk materials of corresponding doping concentrations were obtained by annealing at high temperature. The emission spectra, excitation spectra and X-ray diffraction spectra of Y2O3: Ln nanocrystals and bulk materials were measured. The research indicated that under the effect of quantum confinement effect and surface effect, the Y2O3: Eu charge transfer band red-shifted clearly while the particle size decreased. Furthermore, the charge transfer band of the small size particles (8 nm) clearly broadened towards the long wavelength, this was attributed to the increase of the amount of Eu3+ ions existing in low crystallization degree environment close to the surface. The study also indicated that the shape of excitation peaks (bands) corresponding to the 4f5d transition absorption of Tb3+ in the excitation spectra of Y2O3: Tb nanocrystals changed a lot with the variety of the particle size. This is because that the Tb3+ ions exist in two very different local environments:the low crystallization degree environment close to the surface and the high crystallization degree environment inner the particles. The absorption peaks of 4f5d transition were diffe-rent in the two environments. The Tb3+ ions ratio in the two environments changs with the variety of the particle size. So the intensity of corresponding excitation peaks (bands) changed and the shapes of the excitation spectra changed. By comparing the excitation spectra of different doping concentrations, it can be found that with the increase of Tb3+ (or EU3+) concentrations, the relative strength of the Y2O3 exciton transition absorption excitation peak to the 4f5d transition (or charge transfer band) excitation peak decreased. The excitation efficiency of Y2O3 exciton absorption band is very low when the doping concentrations of the luminescent centers were higher. But the excitation efficiency of Y2O3 exciton absorption band increased when the doping concentrations were quite low.",

Tellurite-based erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) have attracted considerable attention because of over 70 nm broad bandwidth. However, the lower phonon energy of tellurite glass leads to serious up-conversion emission and decreases the efficiency of 1.5 \u03bcm emission. GeO 2 has long been recognized as a good glass former [5] . GeO 2 based glasses have higher phonon energy, better thermal stability and infrared transmission than the tellurite-based glasses. Recently, some of investigations have focused on the tellurium-germanate glasses. Chun Jiang and his coworkers reported the emission properties of trivalent ytterbium in GeO 2 \u2013TeO 2 glasses [6] . Xian Feng et al. reported the effect of composition and various preparation procedures on the content and vibration frequency of hydroxyl groups in Er 3+ -doped GeO 2 \u2013TeO 2 \u2013ZnO\u2013NaO\u2013Y 2 O 3 glasses [7] . Pan and Morgan reported on optical transition of tellurium-germanate glasses (63 \u2212 x )GeO 2 \u2013 x TeO 2 \u201327PbO\u201310CaO, x = 0\u201340 [8] . However, to our best knowledge there is no a detailed study on the infrared emission properties of Er 3+ in the GeO 2 \u2013TeO 2 \u2013ZnO\u2013BaO glass system. It is expected that introducing proper amount of GeO 2 into the telluride glass could improve the glass mechanical and thermal performance, meanwhile, could reduce up-conversion emission and increase pump efficiency. In this paper, the optical transition of Er 3+ , the phonon sideband and optical band edge for the host matrix, and the dependence of quantum efficiency on the glass composition were studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation Glasses with various composition x GeO 2 \u2013(80 \u2212 x )TeO 2 \u201310ZnO\u201310BaO\u20130.5Er 2 O 3 (GEEr) or 1Eu 2 O 3 (GTEu) ( x = 0\u201380, with an increment of 10; if without specific statement below, x represents the same meaning) were prepared by using analytical grade GeO 2 , TeO 2 , ZnO, BaCO 3 and Er 2 O 3 or Eu 2 O 3 as starting materials. Eu 3+ -doped GTEu samples were prepared for obtaining the phonon sideband. According to the designed composition the starting materials were weighed and well mixed together. Each batch was put into an alumina crucible and heated in an electronic muffle furnace at around 1200 \u00b0C for 30 min. The melted mixture was then poured on a preheated brass mold to form glass disks. After 15 h-annealing at 300 \u00b0C, the sample was cut and polished for the spectral measurements. The temperature accuracy for the system is \u00b15 \u00b0C. Table 1 shows the sample numbers, glass compositions and some basic physical characteristics. 2.2 Optical and spectroscopic measurements Refractive indexes of all the samples were measured by using an UVISEL SPME of ellipsometry. The measurement accuracy of refractive index is \u00b10.01. Densities were measured according to Archimedes\u2019 principle using distilled water as the medium. The absolute uncertainty for the densities was estimated by the error transfer principle to be less than \u00b10.1 g/cm 3 . The Er 3+ concentrations and molar volumes were estimated based on the designed composition and the measured volumes. These results were shown in Table 1 . The glass transformation temperature ( T g ) and crystallization onset temperature ( T x ) were measured using a differential thermal analysis (DTA) with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. The measurement accuracy of temperature is \u00b11 \u00b0C. The absorption spectra for all the Er 3+ -doped samples were obtained at a Shumandzu\u29f9UV\u29f93101PC double beam spectrophotometer in the range of 200\u20131700 nm at room temperature. In these measurements the wavelength accuracy is \u00b10.3 nm at UV/VIS and \u00b11.6 nm at NIR. The excitation spectra for the Eu 3+ -doped glass samples were measured with a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, while monitoring the 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 emission at 612 nm. The measurement accuracy of wavelength is \u00b12 nm, wavelength resolution is 1.0 nm. The up-conversion emission, infrared emission spectra, fluorescence decays of Er 3+ : 4 I 13/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 were measured by using the 980 nm pulsed output of an OPO laser (Continue/Sunlite-8000) as excitation light. The fluorescent signals were collected and processed via a spectrometer (Triax 550) equipped with a semiconductor detector controlled by a personal computer. In these measurements the wavelength accuracy is \u00b10.06 nm, and the wavelength resolution is 0.002 nm. 3 Results All the prepared samples with various compositions look better transparent and uniform that indicated all the designed compositions fall into the glass formation range of this quaternary system. It is also found that all the samples show the body color to be pink or red due to the Er 3+ or Eu 3+ doping. We have tried to replace BaO with different amounts of Na 2 O, and then the new glasses with better quality were also obtained. These facts show us that this quaternary system is featured with wider glass formation range and stronger glass-forming ability. In order to evaluate thermal stability the DTA was completed to the glass samples x GeO 2 \u2013(80 \u2212 x )TeO 2 \u201310ZnO\u201310BaO\u20130.5Er 2 O 3 (here x = 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80). The DTA curves are shown in Fig. 1 . In this figure T g represents the glass transition temperature, T x denotes the crystallization onset temperature. It can be seen that as x , namely, content of GeO 2 increases, T g monotonously increases from 340 \u00b0C (for the ternary system: 80TeO 2 \u201310ZnO\u201310BaO, namely GT08) to 590 \u00b0C (for another ternary system 80GeO 2 \u201310ZnO\u201310BaO, namely GT80). The low T g of this tellurite glass is a drawback to its application in optical waveguide produced with ion-exchange, since the ion-exchange usually is accomplished at around 300 \u00b0C [9] . As is seen GeO 2 introduction can increase T g and would make the glass satisfy the ion-exchange technique. Fig. 1 indicates also the change of the crystallization onset temperature while the glass composition is varied. The glass containing 60% of GeO2 and 20% TeO 2 displays highest crystallization onset temperature. The glass GT08 and GT80 exhibit sharp exothermal peaks at about 550 \u00b0C and 750 \u00b0C, respectively. These peaks imply strong crystallization when the samples experience these temperatures. For other samples containing both the components TeO 2 and GeO 2 , the exothermal peaks will appear at higher temperatures then 750 \u00b0C. The temperature difference \u0394 T = T x \u2013 T g , in general, is a sign of the stability for the glass. The larger the \u0394 T the better is the stability of the glass. To achieve a large range of working temperature during the fiber drawing, it is desired that the glass host has as large \u0394 T as possible [10,11] . From Fig. 1 it can be seen that with an increase of introducing GeO 2 -content into the glasses \u0394 T increases except for the sample with x = 80 (namely GT80). Thus, we can conclude that introducing appropriate amount of GeO 2 into this quaternary glass system can improve the glass thermal stability. As well known, rare earth ions in solids do not necessarily emit photons since they can undergo a variety of non-radiative transitions. The most important one is multiphonon transitions from more than one bridged host phonon. Therefore, highest host phonon energy is a very influential factor for optical amplifiers to realize higher emission efficiency. Host phonon energy can be obtained by the phonon sideband (PSB) of Eu 3+ ions and can be clearly observed on the high-energy side of 7 F 0 \u2192 5 D 2 transition [12] . Fig. 2 shows the compositional dependence of the phonon sideband of glass host x GeO 2 \u2013(80 \u2212 x )TeO 2 \u201310ZnO\u201310BaO. It can be seen that phonon energy of glass host increases with increasing GeO 2 -content. The ternary glass system GT08 shows lowest phonon energy around 700 cm \u22121 . The low phonon energy is benefit to enhance the quantum efficiency of 4 I 13/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transition, but it also causes an intense up-conversion emission due to the excited state absorption of 4 I 11/2 state, which wastes the pumping energy. Thereby, properly adjusting phonon energy of the glass host can restrain the up-conversion emission and promote infrared emission originating from 4 I 13/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transition. As seen in Fig. 2 the GeO 2 can be the candidate component for adjusting the phonon energy of the glass host. Choosing proper amount of GeO 2 can improve the emission efficiency (or external quantum efficiency) of 4 I 13/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transition, though the quantum efficiency of 4 I 13/2 probably decreases, nevertheless, higher emission efficiency is more important than the higher quantum efficiency. The optical absorption edge is an important parameter for describing the solid state materials. It is necessary to realize the effect of the content of GeO 2 introduced into the tellurite glasses on optical absorption edge. The optical absorption edge for disordered materials is interpreted in terms of indirect transitions across an optical band gap. For the absorption by indirect transitions the absorption coefficient, \u03b1 ( \u03c9 ), is given by [13] (1) \u03b1 ( \u03c9 ) = A ( \u210f \u03c9 - E OPT ) 2 \u210f \u03c9 , where \u03b1 ( \u03c9 ) is the absorption coefficient, A is a constant, E OPT is the optical band edge and \u210f \u03c9 is the photon energy of the incident radiation. The optical band edge is obtained by extrapolating from the linear region of the plots of \u210f \u03c9 . Fig. 3 shows the compositional dependence of optical absorption band edge in GTEr glasses. The absorption edges of these glasses are in the region of 3.4\u20134.2eV. Increasing the GeO 2 -content will lead absorption edge to blue shift, contrarily, red shift will happen when the TeO 2 -content increases. In order to obtain the optical transition properties of Er 3+ in these glasses with various compositions, Judd\u2013Ofelt [14,15] analysis was performed. The Judd\u2013Ofelt parameters for all the studied samples were calculated according to the standard computing procedure [16] . Fig. 4 shows the parameter dependence on the host composition. In this figure, the X -axis represents the content of GeO 2 and Y -axis displays the values of \u03a9 t ( t = 2, 4, 6). It is found that with increasing GeO 2 content, \u03a9 4 hardly changes, \u03a9 6 decreases by a little, but \u03a9 2 increases first, and then decreases. The error in these calculations is less than 10. It is generally accepted that \u03a9 2 is related with the symmetry of the glass hosts and the covalency of the rare earth-ligand bond. \u03a9 6 is inversely proportional to the covalency of the rare earth-ligand bond [17,18] . According to the electronegativity theory [19] , the smaller the difference of electronegativity between cation and anion ions, the stronger the covalency of the bond. The values of electronegativity, for Te, Ge and O elements, are 2.01, 2.02 and 3.5, respectively. As a result, the covalency of Ge\u2013O bond is a little stronger than that of Te\u2013O bond. With increasing GeO 2 content the influence of Ge\u2013O bond on the local ligand environments around Er 3+ ions increases, therefor \u03a9 6 value would decrease. \u03a9 2 is more sensitive to the evolution of the surroundings than \u03a9 6 . With increasing GeO 2 -content the influence of Ge\u2013O bond on the local ligand environments around Er 3+ ions increases, the disordered degree of environment surrounding Er 3+ become higher, thus, resulting the increase of \u03a9 2 . When the content of GeO 2 increases up to 60% the glass shows the property of germanate glass and the disordered degree of environment surrounding Er 3+ decreases and hence \u03a9 2 would decrease as seen in Fig. 4 . 4 Discussion As mentioned above the tellurite glass having lower phonon energy than that of germanate usually exhibit intense up-conversion emission consuming the pumping energy, so effective elimination of up-conversion emission is beneficial to the infrared emission. Fig. 5 shows the relationship between green up-conversion emission intensity of Er 3+ ions and GeO 2 content under 980 nm excitation. It can be seen that with increasing GeO 2 -content the green up-conversion emission intensity of Er 3+ ions decreases quasi-exponentially. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between the emission intensity of 4 I 13/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transition and GeO 2 -content under 980 nm excitation. It can be seen that with increasing GeO 2 content the emission intensity of 4 I 13/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 of Er 3+ ions first increases and reach its maximum at 70% of GeO 2 -content, and then goes down. From Figs. 5 and 6 , it can be deduced that introducing GeO 2 into tellurite glasses leads to increasing the non-radiative relaxation rate from 4 I 11/2 level to 4 I 13/2 level, decreasing excited state absorption of 4 I 11/2 level and improving emission intensity of 4 I 13/2 level of Er 3+ ions. In the glass with 80% GeO 2 (a pure germinate glass), the intensity of 4 I 13/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transition decreases, this is probably due to its high phonon energy (see Fig. 2 ) which would cause an intensified non-radiative relaxation from 4 I 13/2 level to 4 I 15/2 level; meanwhile, compared with the Er 3+ -doped telurite glass, Er 3+ -doped germinate glass usually displays intense red up-conversion emission [20,21] originating from the excited state absorption from 4 I 13/2 level to 4 F 9/2 level, thus resulting in a decrease of the 1.5 \u03bcm emission. In order to clarify this fact, further experimental study would be needed. According to Judd\u2013Ofelt expression the radiative relaxation rate A rad for the Er 3+ : 4 I 13/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 can be deduced as following form [21] (2) A rad = 16 \u03c0 3 v 3 e 2 3 hc 3 \u03b5 0 ( 2 J + 1 ) n ( n 2 + 2 ) 2 9 ( 0.019 \u03a9 2 + 0.118 \u03a9 4 + 1.462 \u03a9 6 ) + n 3 4 m 2 c 2 | \u3008 f N \u03c8 J | L + 2 S | f N \u03c8 \u2032 J \u2032 \u3009 | 2 . Because of the little contribution of \u03a9 2 and \u03a9 4 to the value of A rad . Eq. (2) can be simplified as (3) A rad = 16 \u03c0 3 v 3 e 2 3 hc 3 \u03b5 0 ( 2 J + 1 ) 1.462 n ( n 2 + 2 ) 2 9 \u03a9 6 + n 3 4 m 2 c 2 | \u3008 f N \u03c8 J | L + 2 S | f N \u03c8 \u2032 J \u2032 \u3009 | 2 , where \u3008 f N \u03c8 J | L + 2 S | f N \u03c8 \u2032 J \u2032 \u3009 are the reduced matrix elements of the operator L + 2 S , which are host independent parameters. Because \u03a9 6 has a little change (shown in Fig. 4 ) the radiative relaxation rate A rad is mainly decided by the refractive indexes n . In Table 1 it shows that with increasing GeO 2 -content the refractive indexes, n , decreases. Consequently, the radiative transition rate A rad decreases with increasing GeO 2 content (see Table 2 ). As well known the quantum efficiency \u03b7 for a certain level of rare earth ions can be depicted as [22] (4) \u03b7 = \u03c4 f A rad , where \u03c4 f denotes the fluorescent lifetime of 4 I 13/2 level. Table 2 shows the radiative transition rate A rad , lifetime \u03c4 f and quantum efficiency \u03b7 of 4 I 13/2 level in x GeO 2 \u2013(80 \u2212 x )TeO 2 \u201310ZnO\u201310BaO glasses. It is seen that with increasing GeO 2 content quantum efficiency \u03b7 of 4 I 13/2 level decreases. However, the intensified emission for 4 I 13/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transition has been observed with the increase of the GeO 2 -content. The intensified emission owes to the partial elimination of up-conversion emission, and the increase of pumping efficiency because the increase of the GeO 2 -content can effectively decrease the population of the 4 I 11/2 level and effectively populate 4 I 13/2 level at the same time. 5 Conclusions A series of new glasses with composition x GeO 2 \u2013(80 \u2212 x )TeO 2 \u201310ZnO\u201310BaO ( x = 0\u201380, with an increment of 10) were prepared by using the melt-quenching technique. On the basis of DTA and optical absorption band edge data, it was suggested that introducing GeO 2 into tellurite glass improved the thermal stability and made a blue shift of the optical absorption edge of host matrix. The increased emission intensity of 4 I 13/2 level and decreased up-conversion emission indicated that introducing proper GeO 2 -content into tellurite glasses improved 1.5 \u03bcm emission efficiency, though introducing GeO 2 led to a decrease of radiative relaxation rate A rad and quantum efficiency of 4 I 13/2 level. It is expected that Er 3+ -doped GeO 2 \u2013TeO 2 \u2013ZnO\u2013BaO glass would be a good candidate for optical amplifier.

        "title": "The spectral properties of the 1S0 state in SrAl12O19:Pr",
        "abstract": "In this Letter we report the spectral properties of the Pr 3+ 1 S 0 state in SrAl 12 O 19 . The 1 S 0 level was observed directly in the excitation spectrum, its position was determined to be 46 490 \u00b1 10 cm \u22121 . The estimated 3 H 4 \u2192 1 S 0 absorption cross section is 5.3\u00d710 \u221220 cm 2 . The lifetime of the 1 S 0 excited state is 658 ns. The main opposite parity component mixed into 4 f 2 1 S 0 is from the 4 f 1 5 d 1 F 3 and 1 H 5 spectral terms. The transitions from 1 S 0 to 4 f 2 1 G 4 and 3 F 4 are zero-phonon transition dominated, while the transition from 1 S 0 to 1 I 6 is vibronic in nature. 1 Introduction The optical properties of Pr 3+ 1 S 0 excited state in inorganic solids have been of great interest since the 1970s [1,2] . Solids in which crystal field split components of the Pr 3+ 4 f 1 5 d configuration occur above the 1 S 0 state are known to produce, on average, more than one visible photon for every incident ultraviolet photon [3,4] . Such phosphors display quantum efficiencies for visible emission well in excess of unity. The development of such high quantum efficiency phosphors would be of great interest to manufacturers of fluorescent lamps and plasma display devices. The position of the lowest energy Pr 3+ 4 f 1 5 d level relative to 1 S 0 depends on both the center of gravity and the extent of the splitting of the 4 f 1 5d-band. Generally, the center of gravity of the 5d band lies in the VUV in ionic crystals, while increasing covalency of the Pr 3+ -ligand bond locates the states at lower energy (nephelauxetic effect). The total splitting of the 4 f 1 5 d state is of course determined by the strength of the crystal field. Most materials studied to date where the 1 S 0 state is located below the 4 f 1 5 d band have been fluorides, which are typical ionic crystals. We recently reported three oxide host materials in which the 1 S 0 excited state is located below the 4f5d configuration and in which the Pr 3+ ion is observed to quantum split: SrAl 12 O 19 ,LaMgB 5 O 10 and LaB 3 O 6 [5\u20137] . These materials offer high coordination number for the Pr 3+ ion which results in a weak crystal field and thus in a high energy position of the Pr 3+ 4 f 1 5 d level. The nature of the 1 S 0 wave function is interesting from the point of view of its interaction with states with opposite parity. The proximity of the 1 S 0 state with the Pr 3+ 4 f 1 5 d configuration permits efficient admixture of the opposite parity 5d components which can substantially influence its optical properties. Thus, for example, 1 S 0 lifetime can be very short (\u223c10 \u22127 s) [2] , reflecting the admixture of 5d wave functions. The strong intrinsic coupling of the 5d states with the lattice can also influences the lineshapes of the optical transitions emanating from the 1 S 0 state and certain 1 S 0 emission features can take on a vibronic character [8] . In this Letter we have evaluated the optical properties of the 1 S 0 state in SrAl 12 O 19 :Pr 3+ . The energy position of the 1 S 0 state and 3 H 4 \u2192 1 S 0 absorption cross section were determined from the measured spectra. The nature of the emission transitions from the 1 S 0 state is discussed in terms of the 4 f 1 5d components admixed into the 1 S 0 state. 2 Experimental Single crystal fibers of SrAl 12 O 19 :Pr, Mg were grown by laser heated pedestal growth (LHPG) method [9] . The starting materials were SrAl 12 O 19 :Pr, Mg powders synthesized at GE [6] . Other samples were synthesized at University of Georgia using a sintered mixture of SrCO 3 ,Al 2 O 3 , Pr 2 (CO 3 ) 3 \u00b78H 2 O and MgO. Stoichiometric amounts of the starting materials were thoroughly mixed via ball milling, pressed into pellet and sintered. The crystal fiber samples are typically 1 cm long with 0.7\u20131 mm diameter. Excitation and emission spectra were measured using a Jobin Yvon-Spex FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer with a resolution of 0.3 nm. Emission spectra at liquid nitrogen temperature and lifetimes were also measured by exciting the samples with the 193 nm line of a PSX-100 Excimer laser (MPB Technologies) using ArF as the laser medium. Fluorescence was measured through an optical fiber coupled to a SPEX 500M monochromator. The signal was detected either by a CCD (Princeton LN/CCD-1340/100-E-1) for spectral or by a PMT (Hamamatsu R-636-10) coupled with a boxcar (Stanford SR-250) for lifetime measurements. The spectra were calibrated with several spectral discharge lamps; the error in positioning of the lines is estimated to be less than 0.05 nm in the whole spectral range of our studies. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 1 S 0 Emission and excitation Fig. 1 is the room temperature emission spectrum of SrAl 12 O 19 :Pr, Mg excited by 204 nm radiation. Though the excitation is at the short wavelength edge of the Xe lamp, the strong 4 f 2 \u21924 f 1 5 d absorption makes the emission spectrum clearly observable. Measuring the background with the excitation wavelength set at 220 nm and then subtracting from the emission spectrum eliminated the influence of stray light. The five groups of lines in the 220\u2013500 nm spectral region of the emission spectrum can be identified as arising from 1 S 0 \u2192 3 F 4 , 1 S 0 \u2192 1 G 4 , 1 S 0 \u2192 1 D 2 , 1 S 0 \u2192 1 I 6 , and 3 P 0 \u2192 3 H 4 transitions (from high to low energy). Fig. 2 gives the room temperature excitation spectra of SrAl 12 O 19 :Pr, Mg in the range of 200\u2013220 nm while monitoring the 1 S 0 \u2192 1 I 6 emission at 401 nm and the 3 P 0 \u2192 3 H 4 emission at 485.6 nm, respectively. The excitation spectra clearly show the 3 H 4 \u2192 1 S 0 transition at 215.1 nm. We find the onset of the 5d band is both concentration and temperature dependent. Fig. 3 shows the effect of temperature on the excitation spectrum of the 1% Pr doped sample. The onset of the 5d band shifts towards the blue by more than 5 nm as the temperature is decreased from 300 to 77 K. As a state mainly with 4f 2 characteristics, the energy position of the 1 S 0 state is not expected to be strongly dependent on the temperature; indeed no thermally dependent shifts can be detected within the accuracy of our measurements. The inset in Fig. 3 shows the 1 S 0 transition at 77 K; the experimental linewidth of the excitation is 0.74 nm, corrected for instrumental effects, yields an intrinsic line width of 0.5 nm or 108 cm \u22121 . The enhanced phonon coupling that is induced by the proximity of the 5d state as alluded to previously cause the relatively large width of the 1 S 0 state. The room temperature 3 H 4 \u2192 1 S 0 excitation trace also shows evidence of contribution from the thermally populated Stark levels of the ground state. The particulars of the four groups of the 1 S 0 emission we have considered are shown in Fig. 4 . The corresponding wavelengths of the emission lines are listed in Table 1 . 3.2 Nature of the 1 S 0 state and its associate transitions SrAl 12 O 19 belongs to the D 6h 4 space group with lattice constants a 0 =0.5568 nm, c 0 =2.199 nm, respectively [12] . The Pr ion substitutes for Sr which has D 3h symmetry in the hexagonal host crystal [13] . According to selection rules in this symmetry, a single transition from the 1 S 0 \u0393 1 to the \u0393 6 component of the 1 D 2 state is expected. The luminescence peaking at 337.7 nm (29 612 cm \u22121 ) in Fig. 4 can be assigned to the 1 S 0 \u0393 1 \u2192 1 D 2 \u0393 6 optical transition. According to the literature, the 1 D 2 \u0393 6 state is located at 16 878 cm \u22121 [13] . Therefore, the position of the 1 S 0 state is determined to be E( 1 S 0 )=29 612+16 878=46 490 cm \u22121 . A similar and consistent value for the energy position of the 1 S 0 state is obtained by taking into account the energetics of the 1 I 6 and the 1 G 4 transitions and by the direct location through the excitation spectra. The UV excited emission spectra of SrAl 12 O 19 :Pr 3+ is similar to LaF 3 :Pr 3+ [2] ; in each instance, four groups of lines are identifiable. The first three-entail spin allowed transitions from 1 S 0 to the singlet manifolds 1 I 6 , 1 D 2 and 1 G 4 while the fourth transition terminates in the 3 F 4 state ( \u0394 S\u22600). It has been shown that the spin\u2013orbit interaction strongly admixes the 1 G 4 state into the 3 F 4 [10] . It follows that the 1 S 0 \u2192 3 F 4 transition gains intensity via this mechanism. The relative strengths of aforementioned group of transitions can be accounted fairly well through Judd\u2013Ofelt considerations. Pappalardo [10] has shown that all these transitions possess large reduced matrix elements of the type ( 2 S +1 L J \u2225U (\u03bb) \u2225 1 S 0 ) 2 . In our case the Judd\u2013Ofelt parameter \u03a9 2 \u226a\u03a9 4 ,\u03a9 6 [11] . Consistent with the Judd\u2013Oflet intensity parameters is the observation that the 1 S 0 \u2192 1 D 2 transition is the weakest of the four groups of transitions because its strength is determined by the \u03a9 2 intensity parameter ( 1 D 2 \u2225U (2) \u2225 1 S 0 ) 2 . Using Beer' law and the excitation spectrum of Fig. 3 , the absorption coefficient of the 1% Pr sample can be determined. With the sample thickness l =1 mm, a value of \u03b1 (215 nm )=1.8 cm \u22121 was obtained for the absorption coefficient. From the crystallographic data of the host lattice we estimate the Pr 3+ site concentration, n=3.39\u00d710 19 cm \u22123 at 1 atomic percent Pr doping. Thus the atomic absorption cross section defined as \u03b1 / n is \u03c3 (215 nm )=5.3\u00d710 \u221220 cm 2 . The measured lifetime of the 1 S 0 as a function of temperature and concentration are shown in Table 2 . In all cases, the decay curves could be fitted by a single exponential function and the error of the lifetimes obtained is within 5%. It is noted that the decay rate is practically independent of moderate changes in the temperature and concentration. For example, the lifetime decreases by approximately 10% when the activator ion concentration is increased from 1 to 10 atomic percent. The explanation advanced for this behavior is that the energy level structure of the Pr 3+ ion inhibits cross relaxation and other interactions that lead to quenching of the 1 S 0 state [7] . Similarly, the weak thermal dependence is indicative of negligible nonradiative multiphonon relaxation since the large energy separation between the 1 S 0 state and the next lower state, i.e. the 3 P 2 state (\u0394E\u224823 000 cm \u22121 ) requires an inordinate number of phonons to bridge the gap. 3.3 4f5d Admixing in the 4f 2 1 S 0 state The nature of the 4f 2 to 4 f 1 5 d transitions in the Pr 3+ free ion has been analyzed by Sugar [14] . Alig and coworkers analyzed the energy levels of the 4f5d configuration of Ce 2+ in a cubic crystal field [15] . Serious efforts to understand similar processes in solids have only been attempted recently but a clear picture of the inter-configurational coupling has not emerged fully as yet [16\u201318] . The site symmetry for the Pr 3+ ion in SrAl 12 O 19 is D 3h . In this site symmetry only singlet states of the 4 f 1 5 d configuration belonging to the identity representation can be admixed into the 1 S 0 state. We call them 1 \u0393 1 states. The Russell\u2013Saunders terms P, D, F, G and H appears in the 4 f 1 5 d configuration as singlets and as triples; of these, only 1 F , 1 G , and 1 H terms contain the 1 \u0393 1 state in D 3h crystal field. However, the odd terms of the D 3h crystal field can only mix states with \u0394J =3, or 5. Consequently the main opposite parity contributors to the 1 S 0 wave function are expected to be the 1 F and 1 H states. According to Hund's rule, the 4 f 1 5 d state of the closest proximity to the 1 S 0 state should be a triplet state; however, for the Pr 3+ it has been shown that strong spin\u2013orbit coupling results in the lowest state of the 4 f 1 5 d manifold developing a substantial 1 G 4 component to complement its intrinsic 3 H 4 state [14] . Though changes do occur in the position and the energy order of the 4 f 1 5 d bands when the Pr 3+ is placed in a solid, free ion spectra indicate that 1 F term lies well above the lowest state of the manifold, \u0394E>7000 cm \u22121 . The 1 S 0 state and the wave function takes of the form a|4 f 2 1 S 0 \u0393 1 \u3009+b|4 f5d 1 F 3 \u0393 1 \u3009+c|4 f5d 1 H 5 \u0393 1 \u3009 in a crystal field with D 3h symmetry. The large energy separation between 4 f 2 1 S 0 and these 4 f 1 5 d states makes the coefficients b and c small. The lifetime of 1 S 0 is about a 100 times longer than typical electric dipole allowed transition. We estimate that b and c would be several hundredths. Besides, |b| might be much larger than | c |, because the 1 H state lies even higher. These features of the admixed 4 f 1 5 d components in the 1 S 0 wave function determine the properties of the 1 S 0 emission. Transitions from the 1 S 0 state are determined by the matrix elements of the form b\u30084 f 22 S +1 L J \u0393 \u03b1 |\u03bc|4 f5d 1 F 3 \u0393 1 \u3009+c\u30084 f 22 S +1 L J \u0393 \u03b1 |\u03bc|4 f5d 1 H 5 \u0393 1 \u3009 , where \u03bc is the electric dipole operator. Such matrix elements can be expressed by 3- j and 6- j symbols and the radial integral \u30084f 2 | r |4f5d\u3009. Since the radiative transitions from the 1 S 0 state to the 4 f 2 1 D 2 , 1 G 4 and 1 I 6 states satisfy all the selection rules the corresponding zero phonon lines should be strong. This is indeed observed experimentally ( Fig. 4 ). The same applies to the transition terminating in the 4f 23 F 4 state, which mixes about 25% Russell\u2013Saunders' 1 G 4 into the wave function [10] . The expected intensity should be about 1/3 of the 1 S 0 \u2192 1 G 4 emission that is close correspondence to the experimentally measured value of 1/2.8. For the 1 S 0 \u2192 1 I 6 emission, the lines at 25 109 and 24 935 cm \u22121 are attributed to the zero phonon lines. Clear vibronic feature, similar to those observed in LaF 3 :Pr 3+ [2,8] are observed for this transition. To confirm this, we plot in Fig. 5 the 1 S 0 \u2192 1 I 6 emission spectrum and the 4 T 1 \u2192 6 A 2 emission spectrum of Mn 2+ in SrAl 12 O 19 , which consists of a sharp zero-phonon line and a phonon sideband with some distinguishable phonon replicas. It is seen that not only do the optical transitions couple with the same phonons but the overall shapes also appear similar. 4 Conclusion In this Letter we have examined the spectral properties of the Pr 3+ 1 S 0 state in SrAl 12 O 19 . Under 4 f 2 \u21924 f 1 5 d excitation, emission transitions from 1 S 0 to 1 I 6 , 1 D 2 , 1 G 4 and 3 F 4 were observed. The 1 S 0 level was observed directly in the excitation spectrum and its energy position of 46 490 \u00b1 10 cm \u22121 was also confirmed from the emission spectra and the energy location of the 1 I 6 and 1 D 2 states. The estimated 3 H 4 \u2192 1 S 0 absorption cross section is 5.3\u00d710 \u221220 cm 2 . The lifetime of the 1 S 0 fluorescence which exhibits weak temperature and concentration dependence is 658 ns in the sample with 1% Pr at room temperature. The knowledge of the 4 f 1 5 d wave functions that is in proximity of the 4f 2 configuration is necessary for understanding the spectral properties of the 1 S 0 state. From spin and symmetry considerations, the main opposite parity component mixed into 4 f 2 1 S 0 are from the 4 f 1 5 d 1 F 3 and 1 H 5 spectral terms. The properties of the 1 S 0 state and the associated transitions are determined by this admixture. Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank Ken Krebs for the measurements with the excimer laser.

        "abstract": "A novel red-emitting phosphor Eu 3+ -doped Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 was developed for white-light-emitting-diodes (WLEDs). The phosphors with various Eu 3+ concentrations were prepared by solid-state reaction route using Na 2 CO 3 as a flux. The effects of the flux content, sintering temperature and the activator concentration on the crystal structure and luminescent properties were investigated by XRD, emission spectra and excitation spectra. It is found that this phosphor can be effectively excited by C\u2013T band (280 nm), ultraviolet light 395 nm and blue light 465 nm. The wavelengths at 395 and 465 nm are nicely fitting-in with the widely applied output wavelengths of ultraviolet or blue LED chips. The Eu 3+ -doped Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 phosphor may be a better candidate for solid-state lighting applications. Keywords Red-emitting phosphor Solid-state reactions Luminescence 1 Introduction As important optical materials, tungstates and molybdates have attracted particular interest because of their importance in practical applications as laser host materials in quantum electronics [1] , scintillators in medical devices [2,3] and phosphor materials in fluorescent lamps, cathode ray tubes and X-ray intensifying screens [4] . In the last decades, a large number of rare earth-doped luminescent materials have been extensively investigated. In most cases, the emission of rare earth ions is due to optical transitions within the f-manifold. The f-electrons are well shielded from the chemical environment and therefore have almost retained their atomic character [5] . As a consequence, the f\u2013f emission spectra consist of sharp lines. According to the electronic structure of ground state, Eu 2+ (4f 7 ) is half filled 4f level and therefore, its stability is greater than that of Eu 3+ (4f 6 ). However, Eu 3+ ion is also seen in well-known red phosphors, Y 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ , YVO 4 :Eu 3+ [6] . In 1997, the first white-light-emitting-diodes became commercially available [7] . There are several ways to gain white light. One is combination of a blue LED with a yellow phosphor, blending the blue light from the LED and yellow light from the phosphor results in white light; another is the UV/violet lights from LED exciting the tri-color phosphors to give white light. However, the phosphors can be effectively excited by blue and/or near ultraviolet (NUV) light are deficient [8\u201311] . From then on, exploiting phosphors, which can be efficiently excited by blue and/or NUV light, became a very active and interesting research subject. Host candidates such as molybdates and tungstates, attract much attention because of some special properties of MoO 4 2\u2212 and WO 4 2\u2212 group. Neeraj et al. reported the red phosphors NaM(WO 4 ) 2\u2212 x (MoO 4 ) x :Eu 3+ (M = Gd, Y, Bi) [7] and Wang et al. reported the red phosphors Ca 1\u22122 x Eu x Li x MoO 4 [12] . Mental Mo can form different valence of Mo ions with the different preparation methods. Gopalakrishnan reported hydrogen reduction of Ln 2 Mo 3 O 12 to Ln 2 Mo 3 O 9 [13] . In this letter, we prepared Eu 3+ -activated Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 by solid-state reaction procedures. Na 2 CO 3 has been widely used in the phosphor preparations by solid-state reaction, and in this study we chose the Na 2 CO 3 as a flux. To our best knowledge, there is no report on the spectroscopic properties of Eu 3+ -doped Ln 2 Mo 3 O 9 . Various experimental factors affecting the luminescence properties of Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu were investigated. 2 Experimental Phosphors were synthesized through the solid-state reaction technique. According to a certain stoichiometric ratio, the starting materials: gadolinium oxide (Gd 2 O 3 , 99.99%), europium oxide (Eu 2 O 3 , 99.99%) and molybdenum oxide (MoO 3 , 99.99%) were weighted. NaCO 3 with purity of 99.9% was used as flux to improve the chemical reaction. After these powders were blended and grounded thoroughly in an agate mortar, the homogeneous mixture was obtained, and then the mixture was put into an alumina crucible and calcined in a muffle furnace at various temperature of from 600 to 1000 \u00b0C for 4 h into the intentional sample. The crystal structure of these phosphors was identified by a RigakuD/max-II B X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu K\u03b1 ( \u03bb = 1.54178) radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA. The excitation and emission spectra of these powder phosphors were recorded with a Hitachi F-4500 using Xe lamp as excitation source. All the measurements were performed at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion For the solid-state reaction, flux is often used to depress the sintering temperature, shorten the reaction time and improve the crystallization. An idea flux can promote the reaction, strengthen the crystallization and the luminescence properties, and it usually does not react with the raw materials. Na 2 CO 3 is frequently used as flux in solid-state reaction because of its low melting point. In this work, different amount of Na 2 CO 3 was used as flux reagent in the sample preparation to investigate the effect on the crystallization and luminescent properties. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the samples prepared with different amount of Na 2 CO 3 . The intensity of XRD peaks for sample with 3% Na 2 CO 3 is higher than that of the sample with 7% Na 2 CO 3 , this fact indicated that 3% Na 2 CO 3 as flux is suitable. Obviously, the XRD pattern of the sample prepared with no flux is different from that of the samples prepared with Na 2 CO 3 as flux reagent. Compared with the JCPDS card, we know that the sample with no flux is \u03b1-Gd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 (JCPDS card 25-0338) and the XRD patterns of the samples prepared with Na 2 CO 3 agree well with Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 structure (JCPDS card 33-0548). It should be noted that the Mo-valence from the starting material MoO 3 to Gd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 was changed. Probably, this valence change is due to the fact that Mo in MoO 3 has highest valence, and tends to be decomposed to form lower-valence-molybdenum oxide and desorbs O 2 at high temperature. In the case of Na 2 CO 3 flux, the discomposed resultant of Na 2 CO 3 , CO 2 , may lead to an O 2 -lacking atmosphere, therefore the lower-valence-molybdenum oxide cannot be oxidized again. In the contrary case without flux, the lower-valence-molybdenum will be oxidized. Anyhow, in order to obtain the Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 phosphor, the solid-state reaction involving the flux Na 2 CO 3 should be doable route. The flux Na 2 CO 3 plays an important role in this reaction. For a more comprehensive understanding of molybdate crystal structures and transform between them, there is still a challenge to the researchers [14,15] . The excitation spectrum for monitoring 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 emission of Eu 3+ can be divided into two regions (as shown in Fig. 2 ): the broad excitation band extending up to 350 nm is attributable to the charge transfer transition of MoO 4 2\u2212 and Eu\u2013O group, and the narrow peaks located at wavelengths longer than 350 nm can be assigned to the f\u2013f transitions of Eu 3+ . The f\u2013f transitions of Eu 3+ in excitation spectrum include sharp lines 7 F 0 \u2192 5 L 6 (Eu 3+ ) at 395 nm, 7 F 0 \u2192 5 D 2 (Eu 3+ ) at 465 nm, and 7 F 0 \u2192 5 D 1 (Eu 3+ ) at 535 nm; their intensities are comparable to the broad C\u2013T band (in Fig. 2 ). For the usual Eu 3+ -doped phosphors the intensity of charge transfer band is much more intense than that of f\u2013f transitions in the excitation spectrum. In Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu system, however, the intensity of f\u2013f transitions is almost equal to that of charge transfer band. This abnormal phenomena was also observed in NaM(WO 4 ) 2\u2212 x (MoO 4 ) x :Eu 3+ (M = Gd, Y, Bi) [7] and AgLnMo 2 O 8 [16] . Probably, this is due to the nature of WO 4 2\u2212 and MoO 4 2\u2212 groups. The emission spectrum of Gd 1.8 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu 0.20 3+ excited by 280 nm was shown in Fig. 2 , it is composed of groups of several sharp lines, which belong to the intrinsic emission of trivalent Eu ion. The weak emission in the vicinity of 590 nm is ascribed to the Eu 3+ magnetic dipole transition 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 , which is insensitive to the site symmetry. The main emission line around 613 nm is assigned to the Eu 3+ electric dipole transition of 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 , which is sensitive to the site symmetry. The domain emission peak at 613 nm indicated that the Eu 3+ located at the lack of inversion symmetry site breaking the parity selection rules. The emission spectra excited by 395 and 465 nm (not shown here) have the same profiles as that excited by 280 nm. Obviously, this phosphor can be excited by C\u2013T band and f\u2013f transition from the excitation spectra and emission spectra. In any cases, it is good sign that this novel phosphor can strongly absorb ultraviolet (395 nm) and visible blue light (465 nm), and transfer the excitation energy to the red radiation. The wavelengths at 395 and 465 nm are nicely in agreement with the widely applied UV or blue output wavelengths of GaN-based LED chips. The effect of flux content on the luminescent intensity of phosphor Gd 1.96 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu 0.04 under NUV (395 nm) excitation illustrated in Fig. 3 . With an increase of the flux content, the luminescent intensities of the phosphor are improved gradually until Na 2 CO 3 amount to 3%. When the flux amount is more than 3%, the luminescent intensity of the phosphor decreases. This fact implies a coherent conclusion that the XRD patterns ( Fig. 1 ) reflect 3% flux could result in best crystallization. So flux amount of 3% is a better choice for synthesizing this phosphor. Sintering temperature is an important factor affects the luminescent properties of phosphors. Fig. 4 shows the emission spectra of the Gd 1.96 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu 0.04 prepared at different temperatures excited by 395 nm. The emission intensity of phosphor increases with a increase of preparation temperature below 800 \u00b0C and it is inversely above 800 \u00b0C. This result tell us that the temperature lower than 800 \u00b0C, the reaction tends to form Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 , while the temperature higher than 800 \u00b0C, other compounds different from Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 crystal structure may grow. The intensity of PL emission in Gd 1.96 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu 0.04 powders prepared at 800 \u00b0C was stronger than those of other temperatures showed that 800 \u00b0C is the optimized temperature for prepared Gd 1.96 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu 0.04 phosphor. The radius of Eu 3+ (0.95 nm) is almost equal to that of Gd 3+ (0.94 nm), therefore, Eu and Gd can form a solid solution (Gd, Eu) 2 Mo 3 O 9 , this point has been verified by XRD. In order to investigate further the effect of the activator ions on the luminescence properties of the phosphor, the relationship between 613 nm emission intensity and concentration of activator ion Eu 3+ is showed in Fig. 5 . As the wide band excitation and f\u2013f excitation have different excitation mechanisms, when excited by wide band and f\u2013f transition, the samples performed different intensity dependence on Eu 3+ concentration. The intensity of the samples excited by 280 nm (wide excitation band) approaches maximum at x = 1, then concentration quenching occurs, while no concentration quenching appears when the samples were excited by f\u2013f transitions (395 nm and 465 nm). The intensity of the sample excited by 280 nm is higher than that of sample excited by 395 and 465 nm at the same Eu concentration. Y 2 O 2 S-doped with Eu is a well-known red photo-luminescent and cathodo-luminescent phosphor. At present, this phosphor is a red candidate for solid-state lighting application. The excitation spectra of Y 2 O 2 S:Eu and Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu are shown in Fig. 6 (top part). Obviously, the excitation spectrum in Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu shows a broad absorption band extending 350 nm and Y 2 O 2 S:Eu shows a broad band extending 390 nm, the f\u2013f transitions (395, 465 and 535 nm) of Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu are stronger than those of Y 2 O 2 S:Eu. Compared with the conventional phosphors Y 2 O 2 S:Eu 3+ , as-synthesized phosphor exhibits higher emission intensity when excited at blue (465 nm) and UV (395 nm). The integrated intensity for 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1,2 transition of Eu 3+ is two times higher than that of Y 2 O 2 S:Eu 3+ under 395 nm excitation (see bottom part of Fig. 6 ). 4 Conclusion In conclusion, Eu 3+ -doped Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 has been successfully developed by solid-state reaction with Na 2 CO 3 as flux reagent. It is found that this phosphor can be effectively excited by C\u2013T band (280 nm) and ultraviolet light 395 nm and blue light 465 nm (f\u2013f transition) and emits red light (613 nm) with line spectrum. The wavelengths at 395 and 465 nm are nicely fitting-in with the widely applied output wavelengths of ultraviolet or blue LED chips. Appropriate amount of flux can enhance the luminescence intensity and improve crystallization. The result shows that the best flux content is 3%. The emission intensity of the sample prepared at 800 \u00b0C was stronger than those of other temperatures showed that 800 \u00b0C is the optimized temperature for prepared Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu phosphor. The wide band excitation and f\u2013f excitation have different excitation mechanisms, the luminescent intensities of the sample excited by 280 nm approaches maximum at x = 1, then concentration quenching occurs, while no concentration quenching was observed under 395 and 465 nm. Compared with the commercial phosphor Y 2 O 2 S:Eu 3+ , the luminescent intensity of as-prepared phosphor Gd 2 Mo 3 O 9 :Eu is two times higher under 395 nm excitation. The developed novel phosphor may be hopeful for the white-light-emitting-diodes in practical applications.

        "abstract": "We report on a novel luminescent phenomenon in Gd2O2S : Er,Yb prepared by a solid-state reaction. After irradiation at 980 nm, the afterglow emission of Er3+ is observed. X-ray diffraction, photoluminescent emission, long-lasting phosphorescence emission and decay curves were used to characterize the phosphor. It is found that the afterglow is improved with the co-doping of Ti4+ and Mg2+. Also the upconversion luminescent spectrum of Er3+ is changed. We ascribe this phenomenon to the change in the environment of activator ions. The phosphorescence properties of the sample are researched in detail. Due to the dependence of afterglow intensities on different irradiative powers, a possible two-step-absorption upconversion long-lasting phosphorescence mechanism is proposed. This kind of mechanism may overcome the shortcomings of the long persistent phosphors which are used for UV irradiation. \u00a9 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

An interesting phenomenon was observed: with an increase in Ag+ content the luminescent intensity of the nanosized crystal is enhanced at first and then maintains a stable level; however for the bulk powder there is no obvious change in the luminescent intensity when the Ag+ content is varied. The morphology and crystal structure were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD), respectively. Emission spectra were measured for nano- and bulk samples. The fluorescence decay curves for all the samples, including nanosized and bulk ones, either with or without Ag+, were measured. It is found that the lifetime for the nanosized sample with Ag+ is longer than that without Ag+, and the lifetime for the bulk sample has no change. From these experimental results we come to the conclusion that the Ag+ ion may link with a surface O2-, which has a free bond, then the surface unsaturated dangling bonds can be eliminated. The elimination of surface dangling bonds may cause the increase of luminescence efficiency of Eu+ doped nanosized Y2O3.",

Cubic nanocrystalline Y2O3 : Eu3+ samples were prepared by chemical self-combustion. The bulk Y2O3 : Eu3+ was obtained by annealing the nanocrystalline at 1 000 degrees C for 2 h. The emission spectra, XRD and fluorescence decay showed that the emission intensities are increased and fluorescence decay becomes slow with an increase in particle diameter of the samples. Two routes were used to estimate the quantum efficiency of the 5D0 level of Eu3+ at C2 site. The quantum efficiencies of 5D0 level of Eu3+ at C2 site in the samples depend on the nanocrystalline sizes. Finally, a detailed discussion about these two approaches for estimating the quantum efficiencies was made.",

The nonradiative relaxation rate of 4I11/2-4I13/2 transition in a glass with 7 mol% P2O5 is four times greater than that without P2O5. The P2O5 additives can also increase the thermal stability of the telluride glass.

However, no single-phosphor, single-emitting-center-converted white light-emitting diodes can simultaneously satisfy the color temperature and rendition requirements due to the lack of sufficient red spectral component in the phosphors' emission spectrum. Here, we report a new yellow Ba0.93Eu0.07Al 2O4 phosphor that has a new orthorhombic lattice structure and exhibits a broad yellow photoluminescence band with sufficient red spectral component. Warm-white emissions with correlated color temperature <4000 K and color rendering index >80 were readily achieved when combining the Ba0.93Eu0.07Al2O4 phosphor with a blue light-emitting diode (440-470 nm). This study demonstrates that warm-white light-emitting diodes with high color rendition (i.e., color rendering index .80) can be achieved based on single-phosphor, single-emitting-center conversion. \u00a9 2013 CIOMP.

Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence and diffuse reflectance spectra are measured to investigate properties of the luminescence. The results suggest that there exists prominent energy transfer from ZnO host to Eu3+ ions. A series of energy levels as temporary storage of excitation energy play a crucial role on this energy transfer process. Two kinds of Eu3+ sites in Eu3+, Li+-codoped ZnO:Zn are distinguished based on the emission and excitation spectra in comparison with pure Eu2O3.",

However, heat treatment at 150 \u00b0C in air leads to a significant decrease of photoluminescence. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and excitation spectra revealed the oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ in the heat-treatment process, which should be responsible for significant photoluminescence degradation due to the breakage of Ce3+\u2192Tb3+ energy transfer.

An orange emission band originating from the T4 1 (G4) - A6 1 (S6) transition of Mn2+ is observed in both phases upon UV excitation through energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+. Photoluminescence and energy transfer in \u03b1 -Ca2 P2 O7: Eu2+, Mn2+ are investigated as a function of Mn2+ concentrations. The energy transfer rates are calculated based on the analysis of the luminescence dynamical process as well as fluorescence lifetime measurements. The intensity ratios of the orange to blue band as a function of Mn2+ concentrations are also calculated and the results are in good agreement with that obtained directly from emission spectra. A white light emitting diode (LED) fabricated through the integration of a GaN near-UV chip and two phosphor blends (\u03b1 -Ca2 P2 O7: Eu2+, Mn2+ blue-orange phosphor and Ba2 SiO4: Eu2+ green phosphor) into a single package shows a warm white light of 3797 K correlated color temperature, a good color rendering index (CRI) of 84, and a luminescent efficiency of 11 lm/W with color coordinates of x=0.39, y=0.40.

Without CTAB, the particle size of the Gd(OH)3 precipitation is about 50 nm, whereas with CTAB, the particle size is less than 5 nm. We propose a mechanism where CTAB micelles work as a catalyst for the nucleation process and result in the precipitation of 5 nm particles. These small particles, after heat treatment at 1073 K, did not result in small Gd2O3 nanoparticles of the same size, but instead, forming crystals of 30-80 nm size in both cubic and monoclinic phases. When monitoring the photoluminescence (PL) peak at 610 nm, we found that the charge transfer state (CTS) absorption amplitude of Eu-O is reduced in the mixed structures. We speculate that the mixed structures modify the surface properties of the Gd2O3:Eu nanoparticles, leading to the reduction of Eu-O CTS absorption.",

The photoluminescence of the samples under UV/ VUV excitation were investigated. The results indicate that the energy is transferred between Ce3+ and Tb3+ under UV excitation while Ce3+ is not beneficial to the emission of Tb3+ under VUV excitation due to the different luminescence mechanism. The blue emission of Tb3+ was observed at low Tb3+ concentration and disappeared at high activator concentration due to the relaxation.",

It is found that a combination of the blue and yellow bands can generate white light at x around 1 under near- ultraviolet excitation. X-ray diffraction patterns of the phosphors demonstrate both Sr3MgSi2O8 and Sr2SiO4 phases, in which Eu2+ contributes to the blue and yellow emissions, respectively.

        "abstract": "Highlights \u25ba The introduction of Sm 3+ to CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ extends its absorption region for near-UV LED. \u25ba The energy transfer pathway is from 4 G 5/2 of Sm 3+ to 5 D 0 rather than 5 D 1 of Eu 3+ . \u25ba The decay pattern of Sm 3+ 4 G 5/2 level is studied at 77 K based on the I\u2013H formula. \u25ba An electronic dipole\u2013dipole interaction between Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ is convinced. \u25ba The coefficient for the energy transfer is obtained to be 8.5 \u00d7 10 \u221240 s \u22121 cm 6 . Abstract Upon 4 K 11/2 excitation of Sm 3+ at 405 nm, the performance of energy transfer from Sm 3+ to Eu 3+ in the red emitting phosphor CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ , Sm 3+ significantly extends its excitation region for better matching the near-UV LED. Photoluminescence spectra indicate that the energy transfer pathway concerns the relaxation from 4 K 11/2 to 4 G 5/2 of Sm 3+ and subsequent transfer to 5 D 0 of Eu 3+ rather than 5 D 1 of Eu 3+ . The fluorescent decay pattern of Sm 3+ 4 G 5/2 level in CaMoO 4 :0.5% Sm 3+ , 2% Eu 3+ is studied at 77 K based on the Inokuti\u2013Hirayama formula, revealing an electronic dipole\u2013dipole interaction between Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ . The coefficient for the energy transfer is obtained to be 8.5 \u00d7 10 \u221240 s \u22121 cm 6 . The fluorescence rise and decay pattern of Eu 3+ 5 D 0 level as Sm 3+ is only excited at 77 K is well described by the dynamical processes of the energy transfer. Keywords Dynamical process Energy transfer Red phosphor CaMoO 4 :Sm 3+ , Eu 3+ 1 Introduction Since the great realization of GaN based blue and/or near-ultraviolet (NUV) light-emitting diode (LED) [1] , solid-state lighting based on phosphor converted (pc) white LEDs has attracted much interests because of its great advantages over the conventional incandescent and fluorescent lamps [2\u20135] in power efficiency, reliability, lifetime and environmental protection [6] . The general strategy of producing white light is to combine a blue LED with a yellow emitting phosphor (YAG:Ce 3+ ). This combination leads to low color rendering index (CRI) because of deficient red component in the yellow phosphor. The combination of a NUV LED with RGB-color phosphors is another alternative, which may provide a high CRI [7] if red emitting phosphors, which are scarce at present, are obtained. Eu 3+ doped CaMoO 4 has been investigated as a potential red emitting phosphor for NUV LED based pc-white LEDs because it exhibits more stable physical and chemical properties than the well-known red phosphor, Y 2 O 2 S:Eu 3+ [8] . The red emission is originated from 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 transition of Eu 3+ and the NUV excitation performs at around 395 nm through 7 F 0 \u2192 5 L 6 absorption of Eu 3+ . Some investigations on enhancing the luminescence intensity of CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ were reported by introducing Li + , Na + , K + and Bi 3+ ions into the phosphor [9\u201311] . Sm 3+ was also introduced in CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ , Zhuang et al. compared the luminescence of CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ with CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ , Sm 3+ [12] . In our previous work [13] , we reported that codoping Sm 3+ into CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ can generate additional NUV excitation line at 405 nm, originating from 6 H 5/2 \u2192 4 K 11/2 absorption of Sm 3+ . This behavior is proved to be the result of energy transfer from the 4 K 11/2 level of Sm 3+ to the 5 D 0 level of Eu 3+ . The significance of energy transfer is to extend the excitation lines for effectively covering the NUV LED source in the spectral range of 390\u2013410 nm so as to take advantage of whole spectral components of the LED excitation source. The energy transfer from Sm 3+ to Eu 3+ has been also investigated in other red emitting phosphors Na 0.5 Sm 0.1 Eu 0.4 WO 4 [14] , NaEu(MoO 4 ) 2 [15] and other molybdate [16] . However, the physical processes and related parameters in the energy transfer in Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ codoped system have not been reported yet. In this paper, we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, the pathway, interaction mechanism and dynamical processes of energy transfer between Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ in CaMoO 4 basing on spectroscopic data and the analysis of rise and decay patterns of fluorescence of Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ by using Inokuti\u2013Hirayama formula. 2 Experimental CaMoO 4 :Sm 3+ /Eu 3+ materials were obtained by solid state reaction in the air as we reported previously [11] . Photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer. In luminescent decay curve measurements, 563.32 nm light pulse from an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) was used as excitation source, and the signals were recorded by a Tektronix digital oscilloscope model (Tektronix, TDS 3052, 500 MHz, and 5 Gs/s) with the sample was situated in liquid nitrogen. 3 Results and discussion The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of CaMoO 4 :20% Eu 3+ , 0.5% Sm 3+ is shown in Fig. 1 a. All peaks for the as-prepared sample match well with the standard pattern of a pure CaMoO 4 tetragonal structure (JCPDS No. 85-0585). No peaks due to any other phases are detected, indicating the dopant ions do not change the crystal structure of the hosts. Fig. 1 b shows the PLE spectra by monitoring the 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 emission of Eu 3+ at 612 nm in Eu 3+ singly doped and Eu 3+ and Sm 3+ doubly doped CaMoO 4 . Both of the samples show a broad PLE band ranging from 200 nm to 325 nm, which is assigned to the combination of the charge transfer transition of Eu 3+ \u2013O 2\u2212 and MoO 4 2 - group [9] . The sharp PLE line located at around 395 nm is ascribed to the 7 F 0 \u2192 5 L 6 transitions of Eu 3+ . The other PLE line at 405 nm, which appears only in the samples containing Sm 3+ , is ascribed to the 6 H 5/2 \u2192 4 K 11/2 transition of Sm 3+ , indicating the performance of energy transfer from Sm 3+ to Eu 3+ . The diffused reflectance spectra of CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ and CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ , Sm 3+ were measured, as shown in Fig. 2 . An absorption edge at 300 nm owing to MoO 2\u2212 is clearly presented in both the samples and the absorption peaks of intra-4f transitions of Eu 3+ at 395 and 465 nm, Sm 3+ at 405 nm are presented. It can be found that the absorption of Eu 3+ ions enhances with the introduction of Sm 3+ . The PL spectra of Sm 3+ singly doped CaMoO 4 under excitation at 405 nm exhibit three characteristic transitions of Sm 3+ : 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 (561 nm), 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 7/2 (596 nm, 604 nm) and 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 9/2 (642 nm), as shown in Fig. 3 A(a). The PL spectra of Eu 3+ singly doped CaMoO 4 under excitation at 395 nm, consists of series characteristic lines of Eu 3+ originating from the transitions of 5 D 1 \u2192 7 F 1 at 534 nm, 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 at 590 nm and 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 at 612 nm as shown in Fig. 3 A(b). In Eu 3+ and Sm 3+ doubly doped CaMoO 4 , the PL spectra under 395 nm excitation ( Fig. 3 A(c)) is the same as that of Eu 3+ singly doped samples, indicating that Sm 3+ cannot be excited by 395 nm and no pronounced energy transfer from Eu 3+ to Sm 3+ . When the doubly doped sample is excited at 270 nm, the characteristic emissions of both Eu 3+ and Sm 3+ can be observed, as shown in Fig. 3 A(d), indicating the charge transfer state of Eu 3+ \u2013O 2\u2212 and MoO 4 2 - group can transfer energy to both of Eu 3+ and Sm 3+ . When the doubly doped sample is excited at 405 nm responsible for the 6 H 5/2 \u2192 4 K 11/2 transition of Sm 3+ , besides the fluorescence of Sm 3+ , the fluorescence from 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 and 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 transitions of Eu 3+ is also observed, as shown in Fig. 3 A(e). This is the indication of energy transfer from Sm 3+ to Eu 3+ . A notable behavior presented in Fig. 3 A(e) is that the 5 D 1 \u2192 7 F 1 emission of Eu 3+ is not detected at 534 nm. As a result, the energy transfer pathway is proposed as illustrated schematically in Fig. 3 B. As the 4 K 11/2 level of Sm 3+ is excited, it completely relaxes down to the 4 G 5/2 state without energy transfer to Eu 3+ . Subsequently, the 4 G 5/2 state either returns to the ground states ( 6 H 9/2 , 6 H 7/2 and 6 H 5/2 ) to emit or transfers its energy to the 5 D 0 level not the 5 D 1 level of Eu 3+ to produce the 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 and 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 emissions. The fluorescent decay curves in CaMoO 4 :0.5% Sm 3+ , x % Eu 3+ ( x = 0, 1, 2, and 20) are studied for understanding the dynamical processes in energy transfer. The decay curves I Sm ( t ) for the 4 G 5/2 level of Sm 3+ are measured at 77 K by monitoring 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 9/2 emission at 650.5 nm as the 4 G 5/2 level is excited by pulsed laser at 563.32 nm, as shown in Fig. 4 . The lifetimes of Sm 3+ 4 G 5/2 level are obtained using the following expression and listed in Table 1 : (1) \u03c4 Sm = 1 I 0 \u222b 0 \u221e I Sm ( t ) dt where \u0399 0 is the fluorescence intensity at the time t = 0. As can be seen in Table 1 , the lifetimes reduce with increasing Eu 3+ content x , reflecting the effect of energy transfer from 4 G 5/2 level of Sm 3+ to Eu 3+ . The decay curve is exponential for Sm 3+ singly doped sample, i.e. x = 0, but non-exponential for Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ doubly doped sample. For the codoped samples, the non-exponential decay is resulted from the inhomogeneous energy transfer rate [17] . After Sm 3+ is excited into its 4 G 5/2 state, the energy transfer from donor Sm 3+ 4 G 5/2 to acceptor Eu 3+ 5 D 0 occurs. The depopulation of Sm 3+ can be described by, (2) n Sm ( t ) = e - t / \u03c4 Sm \u03d5 ( t ) with (3) \u03d5 ( t ) = \u222b 0 \u221e f ( w ) e - wt dw where n ( t ) Sm is the population of 4 G 5/2 of Sm 3+ at time t . f ( w ) is the distribution function of energy transfer rate w ; \u03c4 Sm is the intrinsic lifetime of the 4 G 5/2 level, which is determined to be 595 \u03bcs from the exponential decay curve in CaMoO 4 :0.5% Sm 3+ . \u03d5 ( t ) denotes the loss of excited Sm 3+ ions due to energy transfer to Eu 3+ . If the energy transfer rate between a donor and an acceptor is proportional to an inverse power of the distance r , the rate may be written as \u03b1 / r m , where \u03b1 is the coefficient for the energy transfer, m = 6, 8, 10 for dipole\u2013dipole, dipole\u2013quadrupole, and quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interactions, respectively. According to Inokuti and Hirayama formula [18] , one has, (4) \u03d5 ( t ) = exp - 4 3 \u03c0 \u0393 1 - 3 m n a \u03b1 3 / m t 3 / m where \u0393 ( x ) denotes the gamma function, n a is the number of acceptors per unit volume. From Eqs. (2) and (4) , ln{\u2212ln[ n Sm ( t )]\u2212 t / \u03c4 Sm } acts as a linear function of ln( t ) with a slop of 3/ m . To understand the interaction mechanism between Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ , the Sm 3+ fluorescence decay pattern is chosen as n Sm ( t ). Fig. 5 a shows the ln\u2013ln plot of \u2212ln( n Sm ( t ))\u2212 t / \u03c4 Sm vs time t for the sample CaMoO 4 :0.5% Sm 3+ , 2% Eu 3+ . It is demonstrated that the slope is more close to 3/6 (red 1 For interpretation of color in Fig. 5a, the reader is referred to the web version of this article. 1 line) rather than 3/8 (green line) and/or 3/10, indicating an electric dipole\u2013dipole energy transfer with m = 6. Fig. 5 b shows that the plot of n Sm ( t )exp( t / \u03c4 Sm ) vs t 1/2 is a linear pattern with a slop of 4\u03c0 3/2 n a \u03b1 1/2 /3, as described by Eq. (4) . From the slop of the linear pattern, \u03b1 = 8.5 \u00d7 10 \u221240 s \u22121 cm 6 is obtained, where n a , the number of acceptor Eu 3+ ions per unit volume is given by 2% N Ca with N Ca = 1.284 \u00d7 10 22 cm \u22123 being the number of Ca sites per unit volume in CaMoO 4 matrix. In CaMoO 4 , the nearest Ca\u2013Ca distance r 0 is 0.3896 nm and a Ca 2+ ion has four Ca 2+ ions as nearest neighbors. In the present sample with Eu 3+ fractional concentration of 0.02, the initial energy transfer rate due to Sm 3+ to the nearest Eu 3+ can be estimated by 0.02 \u00d7 4 \u03b1 / r 0 6 , which yields the rate to be 1.9 \u00d7 10 4 s \u22121 . Meanwhile, the initial energy transfer rate obtained by subtracting the radiative rate from the initial fluorescence decay rate in the sample with 0.5% Sm 3+ and 2% Eu 3+ is 2.0 \u00d7 10 4 s \u22121 , which is slightly larger than the calculated value, indicating that the nearest Sm 3+ \u2013Eu 3+ pairs govern the initial energy transfer. Owing to Sm 3+ \u2192 Eu 3+ energy transfer, after pulsed excitation of Sm 3+ 4 G 5/2, the populations of Eu 3+ 5 D 0 satisfies the following rate equation: (5) dn Eu ( t ) / dt = - n Eu ( t ) / \u03c4 Eu + wn Sm ( t ) where n Eu is the population of the 5 D 0 of Eu 3+ , \u03c4 Eu is the intrinsic lifetime of 5 D 0 . Using Eqs. (2), (3), and (5) , we obtain (6) n Eu ( t ) = e - t / \u03c4 Eu \u222b 0 \u221e wf ( w ) w + 1 / \u03c4 Sm - 1 / \u03c4 Eu 1 - e - ( w + 1 / \u03c4 Sm - 1 / \u03c4 Eu ) t dw In the case of electric-dipole\u2013dipole interaction with m = 6, the transfer rate distribution function f ( w ) is written as [19] (7) f ( w ) = 2 \u03c0 n a \u03b1 1 / 2 3 w 3 / 2 exp - 4 \u03c0 3 n a 2 \u03b1 9 w Using Eq. (6) , a numerical calculation for simulating the rise and decay pattern of fluorescence from 5 D 0 of Eu 3+ in CaMoO 4 :0.5% Sm 3+ , 2% Eu 3+ is perfectly performed, as shown in Fig. 6 . In the calculation, \u03c4 Eu = 470 \u03bcs is applied, which is obtained from the exponential decay pattern of 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 fluorescence in 2% Eu 3+ singly doped CaMoO 4 . As one can see, the decay curve of Eu 3+ 5 D 0 level is composed of a rising edge starting from zero and a falling decay. It indicates that the populations of 5 D 0 level of Eu 3+ are completely fed by Sm 3+ 4 G 5/2 through energy transfer. 4 Conclusions In CaMoO 4 :Sm 3+ , Eu 3+ , when the 4 K 11/2 of Sm 3+ is excited, the excited 4 K 11/2 relaxes down to the 4 G 5/2 of Sm 3+ itself rather than transfers to Eu 3+ . The Sm 3+ \u2192 Eu 3+ energy transfer performs through the pathway from Sm 3+ 4 G 5/2 state to Eu 3+ 5 D 0 state rather than Eu 3+ 5 D 1 state. The electronic dipole\u2013dipole interaction between Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ governs the transfer dynamical processes with the coefficient for the energy transfer of 8.5 \u00d7 10 \u221240 s \u22121 cm 6 . As the 4 K 11/2 of Sm 3+ is only excited, the fluorescent rise and decay pattern of Eu 3+ 5 D 0 state is well simulated based on Sm 3+ \u2192 Eu 3+ dipole\u2013dipole energy transfer model.

With increasing x, the energy dispersive spectra show that the O/N ratio increases from 0.54 to 1.43 and the emission and excitation spectra show a redshift due to increased splitting of the low-lying 4f65d1 state of Eu 2+. An additional excitation band appears at around 460 nm for high doping concentrations of Eu2+, perfectly matching the emission wavelength of blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The phosphors can be excited in the near-UV to blue region to emit a broad yellow band in the range 543-562 nm, which depends on x. A white LED is fabricated by combining the Ca 0.85Eu0.15Si2O2-\u03b4N 2+2\u03b4/3 phosphor with a blue GaN chip. Under 20 mA forward-bias current, a CIE chromaticity coordinate of (0.3396, 0.3474), the corresponding colour temperature (Tc) of 5223 K, the colour rendering index of 74 and luminous efficiency of 20 lm W-1 are obtained. \u00a9 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The results show that the SA centers prefer to occupy the sites near the surface and that the donor of SA emission may be related to organic functional groups such as -OH, -CH3 and -COO. The EPR signals are enhanced remarkably in the rinsed nanoparticles comparing with that in the un-rinsed ones. It is believed that organic functional groups physically combine with the surface dangling bonds of ZnS nanoparticles, leading the nonradiative transition channels to decrease, and thus the SA emission to increase.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, Er3+-doped glasses with a broad 1.5 \u03bcm emission band originating from 4I13/2-4I15/2 transition of Er3+ have been extensively investigated for use in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA). Among the reported materials, Er3+-doped telluride glasses exhibited a wide 1.5 \u03bcm emission band and a large stimulated emission section and high 1.5 \u03bcm emission efficiency. However, as a host for EDFA, telluride glass has some major drawbacks. One of them is the phonon energy of the glass is about 770 cm-1, which leads to the 4I11/2-4I13/2 nonradiative relaxation rate too slow to allow efficient pumping at 980 nm. To overcome this drawback, S. Shen et al. added WO3, with vibronic energy of W-O bond of 920 cm-1, into the glass to form tungsten-tellurite glasses. This composition modification increased the nonradiative relaxation rate of the 4I11/2-4I13/2 transition and made improvement of population feeding efficiency of 4I13/2 from the 4I11/2 level pumped at 980 nm. In this paper, P2O5 was introduced into Er3+-doped tungsten-tellurite glasses. Emission, absorption and upconversion spectra of the glasses are studied. It is observed that the nonradiative relaxation rate of 4I11/2-4I13/2 transitions and the 1.5 \u03bcm emission efficiency increases with the increase of P2O5 content, while, the upconversion luminescence was suppressed. The nonradiative relaxation rate of 4I11/2-4I13/2 transition in a glass with 6% P2O5 is about 3.5 times greater than that without P2O5. The present results indicate that telluride glasses with P2O5 addition may be a promising candidate medium for broadband erbium-doped fiber amplifiers with good performance under the pumping of 980 nm.",

It was found that the charge transfer band of Y2O3:Eu3+ red-shifted as particle size decreased, and the charge transfer band in the 5-nm particles obviously broadened toward the long wavelength. It was also found that the profile of excitation spectra corresponding to the 4f5d (4f8 --> 4f(7)5d1) transition changed a lot with the variation of the particle size.

        "abstract": "We report luminescence properties of Ce3+ and Mn2+ co-activated Ca3Sc2Si3O12 (CSS) silicate garnets. It is observed that Mn2+ may not only occupy Ca2+ sites to generate a yellow emission (Mn2+(I)) at 574 nm but also Sc3+ sites to generate a red emission (Mn 2+(II)) at 680 nm. Considerable Mn2+ substitution for Sc3+ can be performed through balancing their charge difference by introducing a trivalent rare earth ion, such as La3+ and Ce 3+, to replace Ca2+. Meanwhile, remarkable energy transfer from the green emitting Ce3+ to both Mn2+(I) and Mn 2+(II) can occur, making tunable color and white light emission available in CSS:Ce3+,Mn2+ upon blue excitation into Ce3+. White LEDs combined by CSS:Ce3+,Mn2+ phosphors and blue LED chips are fabricated. A CSS:0.03Ce3+,0. 2Mn2+ phosphor with deficient red emission is enriched in red by increasing Ce3+ concentration to 0.1, which leads to increase of Mn2+(II) number in case of charge compensation by more Ce 3+ ions. Consequently, the color rendering index of the white LEDs is improved from 64 to 76. The results of this work indicate that CSS:Ce 3+,Mn2+ garnet could be a promising single phase phosphor for white LEDs. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

Decomposition of excitation spectra shows that the charge transfer band of Eu3+ at the S6 site lies in the high-energy side of that at the C2 site, resulting in that the energy transfer from the host prefers to the S6 site. Detailed emission and excitation spectral characteristics were analyzed and discussed. In addition, spectral red-shift were found in both charge transfer bands in nanocrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+ compared to the bulk material. The number ratio of S6 sites to C2 sites is also smaller in nanocrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+ than that in the bulk one.",

        "abstract": "A very long persistent phosphor BaAl 2 O 4 :Ce 3+ was prepared and studied. The Ce 3+ 5d-4f emissions from two Ba 2+ sites in the BaAl 2 O 4 were observed at 450 and 402 nm. The lowest 4f-5d excitation peaks were recorded at 357 and 335 nm, respectively. The persistence times of the long afterglow emissions from Ce 3+ at the two sites were found to be longer than 10 h. Site-selective thermoluminescence spectra of the sample were measured. Two sets of thermoluminescence peaks were detected at \u221243, \u221226 and 27 \u00b0C, and \u221253, \u221236 and 30 \u00b0C (heating rate 13.3 \u00b0C/min) corresponding to the two sites at 450 nm (site-1) and 402 nm (site-2), respectively. Dy 3+ , Ce 3+ co-doped samples were also prepared, which introduce new defect-related traps at 18, 50, and 82 \u00b0C (heating rate 10 \u00b0C/min). These defect-related traps due to Dy 3+ co-doping also contribute to the Ce 3+ afterglow at the two sites.",

The 1 S 0 \u2192 1 I 6 fluorescence intensity can be taken as a measure of the initial 3 P 0 population. Thus the quantum efficiency of 3 P 0 can be calculated using the intensity ratio of the total emission from 3 P 0 and the emission of 1 S 0 \u2192 1 I 6 . The efficiency decreases as the concentration of Pr increases, indicating the effect of concentration quenching. The quantum efficiency is still substantially less than 100% even in dilute sample due to the thermal excitation of 1 I 6 and 3 P 1 states.",

The as-synthesized is the monoclinic phased YPO 4\u00b72H2O with churchite-type structure, which is transformed to the tetragonal phased YPO4 with xenotime-rype structure as the temperature approaches 200\u00b0C during the thermal treatment process. This phase transformation process can not be observed in some routes that need a higher synthetic temperature, in which, only a high-temperature phase is obtained. The luminescent efficiency dependence on the heat-treatment temperature is investigated. The luminescent efficiency presents a two-step increase respectively around 300 and 700\u00b0C. Results indicate that the significant increase of luminescent efficiency at 300\u00b0C is not related to the phase structure transformation, but to the decrease of OH- ions content, and that the significant increase of luminescent efficiency at 700\u00b0C is related to the increase of crystallinity, which may increase the absorption to VUV light.",

The first experiment is a physical pendulum whose damping mechanism is due to sliding friction; the second is magnetic resistance due to eddy currents; and the third experiment involves a pendulum setup where air resistance is the dominant factor. These three damping mechanisms yield constant (\ufffd v/|\ufffdv|), linear, and quadratic resistances in velocity respectively. Approximation methods are described for treating the three damping effects and a general solution is derived for the damping with a very general velocity dependence. A sonic rangefinder is used to record the oscillatory motions of the pendulums. The experimental measurements and theoretical calculations are in a good agreement.",

The result indicates an electric dipoledipole interaction that governs ET in the LED phosphors. For Ce3 concentration of 0.01 in YAG:Ce3, Pr3+, the rate constant and critical distance are evaluated to be 4.5\u00d710-36 cm 6 s-1 and 0.81 nm, respectively. An increase in the red emission line of Pr3+ relative to the yellow emission band of Ce 3, on increasing Ce3 concentration is observed. This behavior is attributed to the increase of spectral overlap integrals between Ce3 emission and Pr3+ excitation due to the fact that the yellow band shifts to the red spectral side with increasing Ce3 concentration. In CaMoO4:Sm3, Eu3, Sm 3Eu3 transfer occurs from 4G5/2 of Sm3 to 5D0 of Eu3. The rate constant of 8.5\u00d710-40 cm6 s-1 and the critical transfer distance of 0.89 nm are evaluated. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

It was also found that the profile of excitation spectra corresponding to the 4f5d (Af 8 \u2192 4f 75d 1) transition changed a lot with the variation of the particle size. The dependence of the excitation spectra of Y 2O 3:Ln 3+ on particle size was investigated. Copyright \u00a9 2008 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "We measured the 1.5 \u03bcm emission spectra corresponding to 4 I 13/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transition of Er 3+ in borosilicate glass within the temperature range from 11 to 300 K. The spectral components emitting from the lowest and upper Stark levels of 4 I 13/2 state were distinguished by analyzing the spectra with normalized area. The effect of optical properties of the spectral components on the 1.5 \u03bcm emission bandwidth is investigated. The results indicate that to search for a host with higher spontaneous emission probability of the upper Stark levels of 4 I 13/2 state for Er 3+ ions is very important to broadening of the 1.5 \u03bcm emission band. An equivalent model of four-level system is presented and applied to explain the spectral shape and temperature characteristics of the 1.5 \u03bcm emission band. Keywords R122 O110 L220",

Experimental result shows that the measurement precision is below 1%, and the comparative fine excitation spectral curve is obtained, the spectral resolution is 1 nm.

Shallow and deep traps are evidenced by thermoluminescence spectrum and decay curve of phosphorescence, which consists of a very fast and a slow component. The photostimulated luminescence presents a slow rising and a falling edge as an infrared excitation at 808 nm is turned on and off, respectively. This is attributed to the result of electron retrapping by shallow traps based on the analysis of dynamical process in photostimulated luminescence involved in photostimulated depopulation of deep traps. The electrons retrapped by deep traps is also demonstrated in the time interval between photostimulation off and on, which results in an enhanced rising edge relative to the former falling edge. \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

        "title": "The mixing of the 4f21S0 state with the 4f5d states in Pr3+ doped SrAl12O19",
        "abstract": "The 1 S 0 state of Pr 3+ in SrAl 12 O 19 lies near to the 4f5d band. The admixing of the opposite parity 5d components by the crystal field without a symmetry center can be significant, thus affecting the properties of the 1 S 0 state. In a crystal with D 3h symmetry, the major 4f5d components which can be mixed into 1 S 0 are 2 \u22121/2 (|fd\u0393 1 1 F 3 3\u3009-|fd\u0393 1 1 F 3 -3\u3009) and 2 \u22121/2 (|fd\u0393 1 1 H 5 3\u3009-|fd\u0393 1 1 H 5 -3\u3009). A calculation of the 4f5d wavefunctions indicates that the states which may be mixed into 1 S 0 lie mainly at the middle and upper parts of the 4f5d configuration. The mixed 4f 2 1 S 0 wavefunction is then calculated and its spectral properties are discussed. Keywords SrAl 12 O 19 1 S 0 state Praseodymium State mixing I Introduction In SrAl 12 O 19 , the Pr ions occupy high coordination sites and hence experience a weaker crystal field environment such that the 4f 2 1 S 0 state lies below the lowest 4f5d state, making it is possible to observe the photon cascade emission [1] . Transitions within the 4f configuration are of a static forced electric dipole nature, and the amount of the opposite parity wavefunctions mixed into the 4f state is affected critically by their separation in energy. Therefore, one would expect the 1 S 0 state, which is energetically quite close to the 4f5d configuration, to show some unique properties different from that of other low-lying 4f 2 states. The questions of concern in this paper about the spectroscopic properties of the 1 S 0 state include: (1) which components of the 4f5d wavefunctions can be mixed into the 4f 21 S 0 state and (2) can the properties of the 1 S 0 state be accounted for by this mixing. In Sections 2 , we describe the calculation of the wavefunctions of the states in 4f5d configuration and, in Section 3 , we present the results of the mixing of 1 S 0 with the 4f5d states based on these wavefunctions. 2 Energy levels of the 4f5d configuration of Pr 3+ ions in SrAl 12 O 19 The Hamiltonian of rare earth ions in solids can be written as (1) H=H fi +H CF +\u22ef, where H fi is the free ion Hamiltonian and H CF the crystal field interaction taken as a perturbation. In the calculation of the free ion wavefunctions of the 4f5d states, we apply the anti-symmetrized combinations of Russell\u2013Saunders states as the basis states and take the Racah parameters ( F\u2019 s and G\u2019 s ) and spin\u2013orbit coupling parameters ( \u03b6 4f , \u03b6 5d ) from Ref. [2] . The crystal field Hamiltonian can be written as (2) H CF = \u2211 k, q, i B kq C q k (i), where C kq ( i ) is the irreducible tensor operate on the i th electron and the index i runs through all the valence electrons. The crystal field parameters B kq 's are generally taken as fitting parameters. With the anti-symmetrized wavefunctions, the matrix element of H CF for a pair of 4f5d spectral terms is (3) SLJM H CF S\u2032L\u2032J\u2032M\u2032 =\u03b4 SS\u2032 \u22121 S+L\u2032\u2212M+l 1 +l 2 2J+1 2J\u2032+1 2L+1 2L\u2032+1 \u00d7 \u2211 k, q J k J\u2032 \u2212M q M\u2032 l 1 k l 1 0 0 0 L k L\u2032 l 1 l 2 l 1 \u22121 l 1 2l 1 +1 B kq l 1 + l 2 k l 2 0 0 0 L k L\u2032 l 2 l 1 l 2 \u22121 l 2 2l 2 +1 B kq l 2 . Here ( ) and { } are Wigner 3 j and 6 j symbols, respectively. The crystal field matrix elements between odd and even L will be zero. The energy levels can be obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) . Pr 3+ occupies the Sr 2+ site in SrAl 12 O 19 and its local symmetry is D 3h [3] . For the fd configuration in D 3h symmetry, the nonzero crystal field parameters are B 20 , B 40 , B 60 , and B 66 for the f electron and B 20 and B 40 for the d electron. The crystal field Hamiltonian can be written as (4) H CF = \u2211 k=2,4,6 B k0 (f)C 0 k (f)+B 66 (f) C 6 6 (f) +C \u22126 6 (f) + \u2211 k=2,4 B k0 (d)C 0 k (d) . According to the properties of the 3 j and 6 j symbols, the Hamiltonian can be divided into six sub matrixes and diagonalized separately. The nonzero matrix elements are those between the wavefunctions with (1) M =0 and M \u2032=0 or \u00b16; (2) M =1 and M \u2032=1 or \u22125; (2\u2032) M =\u22121 and M \u2032=\u22121 or 5; (3) M =2, M \u2032=2 or \u22124; (3\u2032) M =\u22122, M \u2032=\u22122 or 4; and (4) M =\u00b13, M \u2032=\u00b13. Thus the dimensions of the six sub matrixes are 22, 23, 23, 24, 24, and 24. The matrices (2\u2032) and (2), as well as (3) and (3\u2032), are the same, corresponding to 2-fold degenerate states. In the calculation, the crystal field parameters of the f electron are taken from Ref. [3] . The crystal field parameters of the d electron, B 20 ( d )=500 cm \u22121 and B 40 ( d )=15810 cm \u22121 , are chosen as the parameters that best fit the vacuum UV part of the absorption spectrum. The density of the state is defined as D(E)= \u2211 i g i \u03d5 i (E\u2212E i )/ \u2211 i g i , where E i is the eigenvalue of the i th eigenstate, g i is its degeneracy, \u03d5 i is the normalized lineshape of this state. The dotted line in Fig. 1 shows D ( E ) of all the 4f5d states that is calculated by assuming a Gaussian profile with a spectral width (half width at 1/ e maximum) of 1500 cm \u22121 for all the 4f5d states. The other two curves in the figure will be discussed in the next section. 3 The mixing of the 4f 2 1 S 0 state with the 4f5d states The odd terms of the crystal field mix wavefunctions with opposite parities. For D 3h symmetry, the nonzero odd crystal field terms are (5) H CF ( odd )=A 33 \u30084f|r 3 |5d\u3009 \u2211 i C 3 (3) (i)+C \u22123 (3) (i) +A 53 \u30084f|r 5 |5d\u3009 \u2211 i C 3 (5) (i)+C \u22123 (5) (i) +\u22ef. With the wavefunctions obtained based on the procedures described in Section 2 , we may consider the type of 4f5d wavefunctions that can be mixed into the 4f 2 1 S 0 state. Since 1 S 0 is a singlet and belongs to the identity representation, \u0393 1 , of the crystal symmetry group, the 4f5d state that can be mixed into 1 S 0 by the crystal field must also be a singlet with \u0393 1 symmetry. The \u0393 1 singlet states in the 4f5d configuration contain anti-symmetric spin and symmetric orbital components. The orbital component can be written as 1/ 2 l 1 l 2 SLJM\u3009+|l 2 l 1 SLJM\u3009 . The matrix element that determines this admixing is (6) 1 2 fd SLJM C q k (1)+C q k (2) ff0000 + df SLJM C q k (1)+C q k (2) ff0000 = (\u22121) \u2212M 2 (\u22121) L \u22121 \u03b4 S0 35(2J+1)(2L+1) J k 0 \u2212M q 0 J k J 0 0 L L k 0 3 3 2 2 k 3 0 0 0 . It is nonzero if S =0, L = J = k =odd , k \u2a7d5, and M = q . Thus, only 2 \u22121/2 (|fd\u0393 1 1 F 3 3\u3009-|fd\u0393 1 1 F 3 -3\u3009) and 2 \u22121/2 (|fd\u0393 1 1 H 5 3\u3009-|fd\u0393 1 1 H 5 -3\u3009) can be mixed into 1 S 0 . The calculated densities of these two wavefunctions are shown in Fig. 1 . Nonzero density appears at 3000 cm \u22121 above the bottom of the 4f5d configuration, while the maxima of the state densities are 10,000 cm \u22121 or higher above the bottom. Taking 4f 2 1 S 0 and 4f5d\u0393 1 states as zero-order wavefunctions and obtaining the odd-rank crystal field parameters A kq from Ref. [3] and \u30084f| r k |5d\u3009 from Ref. [4] , we diagonalized the Hamiltonian and obtained the mixed wavefunctions. The admixture of 4f5d into 4f 2 1 S 0 , 4f 2 1 S 0 \u2032 , can be written as (7) | 4f 2 1 S 0 \u3009\u2032=0 .9986|4f 2 1 S 0 0\u3009\u22120.0342 |4f5d 1 F 3 3\u3009\u2212| 4f5d 1 F 3 \u22123\u3009 +0.0143 |4f5d 1 H 5 3\u3009\u2212 |4f5d 1 H 5 \u22123\u3009 . The state contains about a 0.003 admixture of 4f5d wavefunctions. Its lifetime is expected to be 300 times longer than the parity allowed transition and should be of the order of magnitude of \u03bcs, which is longer than the measured value of 650 ns. Closer agreement may occur if the mixing of the 4f5d states with the final states in the emission transition and the mixing of 1 S 0 with the configurations higher than 5d are taken into account. Spin\u2013orbit coupling interaction mixes the wavefunctions with the same J , thus the |4f 2 1 S 0 \u3009 state is actually a Russell\u2013Saunders admixture of 1 S 0 and 3 P 0 . In D 3h field, the 3 P 0 component can mix with |4f5d 3 F 3, 4 \u0393 1 \u3009 and |4f5d 3 H 4, 5, 6 \u0393 1 \u3009. In LaF 3 : Pr 3+ , the admixture=0.9962| 1 S 0 \u3009+0.0876| 3 P 0 \u3009 [5] , suggesting the coefficient of the 3 P 0 state in our system also to be very small. In our system, additional 4f5d components being mixed into 1 S 0 is estimated using the data in LaF 3 to be a value (coefficient) of 6\u00d710 \u22125 , yielding a 2% deviation from the result without accounting for 3 P 0 component. We therefore neglect 3 P 0 component in our calculation. The emission spectrum from the admixed 1 S 0 to the 4f 2 state can be predicted from the calculated wavefunctions. Since the 4f5d spectral terms mixed into 1 S 0 are 2 \u22121/2 (|fd\u0393 1 1 F 3 3\u3009-|fd\u0393 1 1 F 3 -3\u3009) and 2 \u22121/2 (|fd\u0393 1 1 H 5 3\u3009-|fd\u0393 1 1 H 5 -3\u3009), the spin-allowed transitions are to 1 D 2 , 1 G 4 , and 1 I 6 . However, spin\u2013orbit coupling mixes 4f 2 states with the same J , yielding possible transitions to 3 P 2 , 3 F 2 , 3 F 4 , 3 H 4 , and 3 H 6 . The calculated intensities of the 1 S 0 emission lines relative to that of the 1 S 0 \u2013 1 G 4 emission are given in Table 1 . For comparison, the measured values are listed in the last column. The transitions ending on 1 I 6 , 1 G 4 , 3 F 4 , and 1 D 2 are relatively strong. The high intensity of 1 S 0 \u2192 3 F 4 is due to the fact that the 3 F 4 state contains about 1/4 of the 1 G 4 character through spin\u2013orbit coupling [5] . Weak lines related to the transitions to 3 H 4 and 3 P 2 may be observed, which qualitatively agree with the measured emission spectrum. There is a significant discrepancy in the intensity of the 1 S 0 \u2192 1 I 6 transition that is theoretically expected to be much weaker than that of 1 S 0 \u2192 1 G 4 , while experimentally it is only slightly weaker. Since the 1 S 0 \u2192 1 I 6 emission is dominated by vibronic transitions, the discrepancy may be attributed to the existence of dynamic coupling between the 4f 2 and 4f5d states that is not considered in our calculations. In summary, the crystal field of SrAl 12 O 19 mixes the 4 f 2 1 S 0 state of Pr 3+ ions with 4f5d 1 F 3 and 1 H 5 . The spectroscopic properties of the 1 S 0 state can be explained, at least qualitatively, by this admixing.

        "abstract": "Nano-powders Y2O3 with various particle sizes and different doping concentrations of Ln(Ln=Tb,Tm,Eu) were prepared by using a combustion technique.The bulky powders doped with concentrations corresponding to nano-powders were obtained by annealing the nano-powders at high temperature.The emission spectra,XRD spectra and TEM were used in the present study.The concentration quenching of luminescent centers and energy transfer between luminescent centers in Y2O3\u2236Ln nanocrystal powders were investigated.It was found that the behaviors of luminescence concentration quenching for 5D4\u21927F5\u2236Tb3+ and 5D0\u21927F2\u2236Eu3+ in nano-powders are similar to that in bulky powders.On the contrary,the quenching concentrations for 5D3\u21927F5\u2236Tb3+ and 1D2\u21923H4\u2236Tm3+ are distinctly higher than that in bulk powders.This owes to the size confinement effect: the interface of nanocrystal particles can stop a portion of the energy transfer,which happens in the bulk ones,between luminescent centers.The size confinement effect can bring different influences to the different types of energy transfer.For instance,it will restrain the energy transfer(governed by electric dipole-dipole interaction) between the ions in long distances,and will hardly affect the energy transfer(governed by exchange interaction) between the ions locating at near intervals.",

Spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime measurements demonstrate that energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ performs with transfer efficiency as high as 65% for Mn2+ concentration of 12 mol %. The authors have fabricated a white light emitting diode (LED) through the integration of GaN near-UV chip and two phosphor blends (\u03b1- Ca2 P2 O7: Eu2+, Mn2+ blue-orange phosphor and Ba2 Si O4: Eu2+ green phosphor) into a single package.

        "abstract": "Aqueous precipitation method has been used to synthesize lanthanide orthophosphates LnPO 4 \u00b7 nH 2O (Ln = La, Ce, Gd, Tb, Dy) with high purity and yield. It has been shown by XRD, TGA, and FTIR characterization that the as-synthesized samples are the LnPO 4 hydrates (LnPO 4 \u00b7 nH 2O) with hexagonal rhabdophane-type structure. The X-ray diffraction peaks and absorption of PO 4 3- groups show a systematic shift from LaPO 4 \u00b7 nH 2O to DyPO 4 \u00b7 nH 2O due to the effect of lanthanide ionic contraction. The value of n in LnPO 4 \u00b7 nH 2O depends on the lanthanide element and synthetic condition. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy observations show the morphology of as-synthesized samples, which consist entirely of nanorods/nanowires with diameters of 30-100 nm and lengths ranging from several hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. The anisotropic growth of crystals should be responsible for the formation of nanorods/nanowires, which is related to the hexagonal crystal structure.

In the charging process, the luminescence grows gradually before reaching the equilibrium intensity. The unreleased area above the charging curve represents the energy stored in the traps. It is found that the integrated intensity of the released phosphorescence after excitation is larger than that of the unreleased luminescence in the charging process. Under an intensive excitation, a decrease course of the luminescence in the charging process is observed. A quenching mechanism via cross relaxation among Eu2+ ions is proposed. The quantum efficiency is measured by comparing the integrated intensities of the phosphorescence and the pump light. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The excitation spectra of the 694 nm emission exhibit strong f-d band of Eu 2+, indicating the existence of the energy transfer. The dependence of lifetimes and intensities of the red and blue emissions on Cr3+ concentrations are studied.

        "abstract": "We present an investigation of dynamical processes of nonradiative energy transfer (ET) between Ce3+ and Pr3+, and between Pr 3+ ions in Y3 Al5O12: Ce 3+, Pr3+ phosphor. Photoluminescence spectroscopy and fluorescence decay patterns are studied as a function of Pr3+ and Ce3+ concentrations. The analysis based on Inokuti-Hirayama model indicates that the ET from the lowest 5d state of Ce3+ to the D1 2 state of Pr3+, and the quenching of the D1 2 state through a cross relaxation involving Pr3+ ions in the ground state are both governed by electric dipole-dipole interaction. An increase in the Ce3+- Pr3+ ET rate followed by the enhanced red emission line of Pr 3+ relative to the yellow emission band of Ce3+ on only increasing Ce3+ concentration is observed. This behavior is attributed to the increase in the spectral overlap integrals between Ce 3+ emission and Pr3+ excitation due to the fact that the yellow band shifts to the red spectral side with increasing Ce3+ concentration while the red line dose not move. For Ce3+ concentration of 0.01 in YAG: Ce3+, Pr3+, the rate constant and critical distance are evaluated to be 4.5\u00d7 10-36 cm 6 s-1, 0.81 nm for Ce3+-Pr3+ ET and 2.4\u00d7 10-38 cm6 s-1, 1.30 nm for Pr 3+-Pr3+ ET. Spectroscopic study also demonstrates a pronounced ET from the lowest 4f5d of Pr3+ to the 5d of Ce 3+. A proportional dependence of the initial transfer rate on acceptor concentration is observed in each of these ET pathways. The proportional coefficient as the averaged ET parameters for initial decay are determined, meaning the ET efficiency for the same concentration of acceptors follows the order of Pr3+-Pr3+ > Pr3+- Ce3+ > Ce3+-Pr3+. \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we observed that in Er 3+ /Yb 3+ codoped nanocrystals (NC), with the decreasing particle size and the increasing Yb 3+ concentration, the upconversion luminescence (UCL) of the red emissions of F 9 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 gradually increased, while the green emissions of S 3 / 2 4 / H 11 / 2 2 gradually diminished under 980 nm diode laser excitation. In NC with lower Yb 3+ concentration, both the red and green emissions result from a two-photon excitation. In NC with higher Yb 3+ concentration, the red emissions result from a two-photon excitation, while the green emissions dominantly result from a three-photon excitation. A model was provided for explaining the above UCL phenomena. PACS 61.46.+w 78.55.\u2212m Keywords A. Nanostructures E. Luminescence 1 Introduction The reduction of particle size of crystalline systems leads to important modification of some of their optical and electronic properties [1,2] , such as the quantum confinement effect and the surface effect In 1994, Bhargava et al. reported that Mn-doped nanocrystalline ZnS phosphors yield high luminescence efficiency [3] due to the confinement effect. Since this report, optical properties of nanocrystalline insulating semiconductor have been investigated extensively [3\u20136] . Some oxide doped with rare earth ions (RE) are important phosphors and thus the corresponding nanocrystals (NC) have attracted considerable attention [7\u201310] . For example, RE doped yttria (Y 2 O 3 ) are common phosphors in optical display and lighting applications, and the search for new phosphors has led to the preparation of nanocrystalline forms of Y 2 O 3 . Over the past several years, much attention has been given to two well-known phosphors, Y 2 O 3 : Eu 3+ and Y 2 O 3 : Tb 3+ [11\u201316] . The availability of high-power infrared laser diodes (LD) has stimulated researches in the areas of upconversion luminescence (UCL) materials, because of their potential application in upconversion pumped visible lasers, light emitting devices and three-dimensional displays, IR detection and so on [17\u201319] . Correspondingly, the nanosized UCL materials have also drawn great interests. There are a few reports on UCL of trivalent RE ions doped yttria NC [20\u201322] . Capobianco et al. reported the enhancement of red emission in Er-doped nanocrystalline yttria. Matsuura observed the quenching of green emissions with increasing concentration of Yb 3+ ions in Er 3+ /Yb 3+ codoped NC. In this paper, the UCL in Er 3+ /Yb 3+ codoped Y 2 O 3 NC as a function of particle size, Yb 3+ concentration and excitation power under 980 nm diode laser excitation was reported. Three-photon UCL phenomenon for the green levels in Er 3+ /Yb 3+ codoped Y 2 O 3 NC was observed, for the first time to our knowledge. 2 Experiments Cubic Y 2 O 3 NC doped with 1 mol% of Er 2 O 3 and 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 mol% of Y 2 O 3 (Y 1.98 Er 0.02 O 3 , Y 1.96 Yb 0.02 O 3 , Y 1.92 Yb 0.06 Er 0.02 O 3 , Y 1.88 Yb 0.10 Er 0.02 , Y 1.82 Yb 0.16 Er 0.02 O 3 , Y 1.78 Yb 0.20 Er 0.02 O 3 ) were prepared using a solution combustion synthesis procedure, which was originally reported by Y. Tao et al. and L. E. Shea. et al. [23,24] . Details of the synthesis have been given elsewhere [13] . The particle size was controlled by the glycine-to-metal nitrate ratio (G/N) of the aqueous precursor solution. In our work, G/N=1.67, 1.45, 1.25 and 1.00 were employed to prepare the aqueous precursor solutions. After the reaction finished, white nanocrystalline powders were annealed at 500 \u00b0C for 1 h. Using X-ray diffraction (XRD), it was shown that the propellant synthesis of the powders yields cubic NC. The particle sizes were estimated to be 7, 12, 30, and 65 nm corresponding to G/N=1.67, 1.45, 1.25 and 1.00, respectively. UCL spectra were measured under 980 nm diode laser excitation. The visible emissions were collected using a F-4500 spectrometer. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the UCL spectra in NC with different sizes. Green emissions of H 11 / 2 2 / S 3 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 and red emissions of F 9 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 were observed. It is apparent that the intensity of both the green emissions and the red emissions decreased with decreasing the particle size. And, the intensity ratio of the red emissions to the green emissions increased with decreasing the particle size. Fig. 2 shows the UCL spectra in the 65 nm NC with different Yb 3+ concentrations. It can be seen that the intensity of red emissions gradually increased, whereas the intensity of green emissions gradually diminished as the Yb 3+ concentration increased. Fig. 3 shows the UCL spectra of the 65 nm Er 0.02 Yb 0.20 Y 1.78 O 3 NC at different excitation powers. The red emissions of F 9 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 , green emissions of S 3 / 2 4 / H 11 / 2 2 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 and blue emissions of H 9 / 2 2 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 were observed. It is obvious that the relative intensity of the green emissions/blue emissions to the red emissions increased gradually with increasing the excitation power. It should be pointed out that the blue emissions occurred only as the Yb 3+ concentration was higher. Fig. 4 shows ln\u2013ln plot of the emission intensity of the 65 nm (a) Er 0.02 Yb 0.02 Y 1.96 O 3 and (b) Er 0.02 Yb 0.20 Y 1.78 O 3 powders as a function of excitation power. For any upconversion mechanism, the visible output intensity ( I v ) will be proportional to some power ( n ) of the infrared excitation ( I IR ) power [25,26] : (ET3) I v \u221d I I R n , where n is the number of IR photons absorbed per visible photon emitted. In Fig. 4 (a), the graph of ln ( I v ) versus ln ( I IR ) yields a slope of n equal to approximately 2 for both the red F 9 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 and the green H 11 / 2 2 / S 3 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 emissions. In Fig. 4 (b), the graph of ln ( I v ) versus ln ( I IR ) yields a slope of \u223c3 for the green H 11 / 2 2 / S 3 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 emissions and the blue H 9 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 emissions. Thus we can claim that two photons are involved in the UC mechanism responsible for populating the red levels. Two-photons are involved for populating the green levels in the NC with lower Yb 3+ concentration, while three photons are involved for populating the green levels as well as the blue levels in the NC with higher Yb 3+ concentration. To our knowledge, few author observed a three-photon populating phenomenon for the green levels in Er 3+ /Yb 3+ codoped materials except F. Song et al. [27] . The results above indicate that the mechanisms involved in populating the 4 S 3/2 and F 9 / 2 4 are quite different. Fig. 5 presents energy level diagram of the Er 3+ /Yb 3+ codoped system and UCL processes under 980 nm excitation. According to Fig. 5 , the two-photon processes for populating F 9 / 2 4 (corresponding to the F 9 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 red emissions) can be expressed as: (ET1) F 5 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + I 15 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 F 7 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + I 11 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) I 11 / 2 2 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 I 13 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) ( nonradiative relaxation ) (ET2) F 5 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + I 13 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 F 7 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + F 9 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) The processes for populating the green emissions in NC containing lower Yb 3+ concentration can be expressed as: (ET1) F 5 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + I 15 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 F 7 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + I 11 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) (ET2) F 5 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + I 11 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 F 7 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + F 7 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) F 7 / 2 2 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 H 11 / 2 2 / S 3 / 2 4 ) ( nonradiative relaxation ) . The processes for green emissions as well as blue emissions in NC containing higher Yb 3+ concentration can be expressed as: (ET1) F 5 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + I 15 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 F 7 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + I 11 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) I 11 / 2 2 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 I 13 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) ( nonradiative relaxation ) (ET2) F 5 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + I 13 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 F 7 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + F 9 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) (ET3) F 9 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) + F 5 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) \u2192 F 7 / 2 2 ( Yb 3 + ) + G 11 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) G 11 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 H 9 / 2 2 ( nonradiative relaxation ) G 11 / 2 4 ( Er 3 + ) \u2192 H 9 / 2 2 \u2192 H 11 / 2 2 / H 3 / 2 4 ( nonradiative relaxation ) In ET3, the process of 4 F 9/2 (Er 3+ )+ 2 F 5/2 (Yb 3+ )\u2192 2 F 7/2 (Yb 3+ )+ 2 H 9/2 (Er 3+ ) may happen also. However, considering the match of energy separation, we assumed that this process can be neglected in comparison to the process of 4 F 9/2 (Er 3+ )+ 2 F 5/2 (Yb 3+ )\u2192 2 F 7/2 (Yb 3+ )+ 4 G 11/2 (Er 3+ ). All the experimental phenomena above can be well explained by the model described in Fig. 5 . First, the size-dependent UCL behavior can be well explained. For populating the S 3 / 2 4 / H 11 / 2 2 level, the I 11 / 2 4 \u2212 I 13 / 2 4 nonradiative relaxation processes are involved. The energy gap (\u0394 E ) between I 11 / 2 4 and I 13 / 2 4 is \u223c3700 cm \u22121 . For the bulkY 2 O 3 host, the largest phonon energy ( h\u03c9 ) is only \u223c600 cm \u22121 . As well known, the rate of multiphonon relaxation is dominated by (1+\u3008 n \u3009) P , where n is the phonon density and P = \u2212 \u0394 E / h \u03c9 . The larger the \u0394 E/h\u03c9 is, the smaller the rate of multiphonon relaxation is. Thus the nonradiative relaxation rate of I 11 / 2 4 \u2212 I 13 / 2 4 in the bulk Y 2 O 3 is relative small. In NC, the groups with high frequency vibrational modes like CO 2 3 \u2212 and OH \u2212 are involved due to surface contamination and they increase with decreasing the particle size [28,29] . These groups can bridge the gap between I 11 / 2 4 and I 13 / 2 4 effectively and thus leads the population channels for S 3 / 2 4 / H 11 / 2 2 to be effective. This is a main factor leading the relative intensity of the red emissions to the green emissions to increase. Actually, the other nonradiative relaxations for Er 3+ also increase with decreasing the particle size, leading to the quenching of UCL. On the other hand, the nonradiative transition rate of F 5 / 2 2 \u2212 F 7 / 2 2 for Yb 3+ ions increases rapidly, leading the ET processes from Yb 3+ to Er 3+ to be ineffective and the UCL of Er 3+ to decrease. This point was confirmed by UCL dynamics. Second, the UCL as a function of Yb 3+ concentration can be also explained. The dominant mechanism for populating F 9 / 2 4 is energy transfer upconversion (ETU). The increase of concentration of Yb 3+ greatly promotes the ET from Yb 3 + ( F 3 5 / 2 ) to Er 3 + ( I 11 / 2 4 ) and thus the F 9 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 transition has been considerably accelerated because of an increase of the ET process [20] . As to the quenching of green emissions with increasing Yb 3+ concentration, can be well understand by the ET process of 4 S 3/2 (Er 3+ )+ 2 F 7/2 (Yb 3+ )\u2192 4 I 13/2 (Er 3+ )+ 3 F 5/2 (Yb 3+ ) which leads to the depopulation of the S 3 / 2 4 level. This process was confirmed by the downconversion luminescence experiments under 488 nm excitation. We observed that under 488 nm excitation, the green emissions of H 11 / 2 2 / S 3 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 decreased dramatically with increasing concentration of Yb 3+ , while the red emissions of F 9 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 had only a little variation. As is well known, the largest phonon energy for the host of Y 2 O 3 is a little bit larger than that for Yb 2 O 3 , which may lead to the increase of nonradiative relaxation. However, the increase of nonradiative relaxation should not only quench the green emissions, but also quench the red emissions. To understand the quenching of the green emissions, the ET process from Er 3+ to Yb 3+ should be considered. It was observed that the fluorescence decay time constant for the S 3 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 decreased greatly with increasing Yb 3+ concentration, suggesting that the ET from Er 3+ to Yb 3+ happened in the S 3 / 2 4 level. Considering the energy gap, we deduce that the ET process of 4 S 3/2 (Er 3+ )+ 2 F 7/2 (Yb 3+ )\u2192 4 I 13/2 (Er 3+ )+ 2 F 5/2 (Yb 3+ ) occurs and quench the green emissions of S 3 / 2 4 \u2212 I 15 / 2 4 . Finally, the power-dependent UCL characteristic can be well explained. For the NC containing higher Yb 3+ concentration, the ET process of 4 F 9/2 (Er 3+ )+ 2 F 5/2 (Yb 3+ )\u2192 2 F 7/2 (Yb 3+ )+ 4 G 11/2 (Er 3+ ) becomes more effective as the excitation power increases, leading the depopulation of the F 9 / 2 4 level and the population enhancement of G 11 / 2 4 . Due to multi-phonon relaxation, the populations for H 9 / 2 2 and S 3 / 2 4 / H 11 / 2 2 also increase, leading the increase of the relative intensity of red green emissions/blue emissions to the red emissions. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, it was observed that under 980 nm excitation, the intensity ratio of the red emissions to the green emissions of UCL varied depending on the particle size, Yb 3+ concentration and the output power of excitation light. The red emissions originate from two-photon excitation. The green emissions originate from two-photon excitation in NC containing lower Yb 3+ concentration, while from three-photon excitation in NC containing higher Yb 3+ concentration. A model was given to explain the UCL processes under 980 nm excitation. Our present work is useful not only of understanding the UCL mechanism in Er 3+ /Yb 3+ codoped NC, but also of the mechanism in the other hosts.

The structure of the 3CdO-Al2O3-3SiO2:Eu3+ system (CAS:Eu3+) has been determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The excitation and the emission spectra indicated that the red characteristic emission (611 nm) of CAS:Eu3+ under UV excitation due to 5D0\u21927F2 electric dipole transition is the strongest. Both XRD data and the emission ratio of (5D0\u21927F2)/(5D0\u21927F1) reveal that the Eu3+ is in a site without inversion symmetry. The maximum photoluminescence intensity has been obtained for 25 mol% concentration of Eu3+ in CAS, and the intensity enhancement and lifetime increase of Eu3+ with increasing sintering temperature were observed due to the less OH-content in the samples. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "The effects of the 4f(2)5d configuration on the intraconfigurational [Formula: see text] electric dipole transitions of Nd(3+) doped YPO(4) are taken into account by a 'direct' calculation. A simple model is applied to analyze the opposite-parity 4f(2)5d configuration admixing into 4f(3) transitional states. The matrix elements of the odd-rank crystal-field interaction and the interconfigurational electric dipole transition are directly expressed using a standard tensor operator method. A set of selection rules for f-d mixing and f-f electric dipole transitions is built up. The admixture effect is considered including both explicit 4f(2)5d configuration and other opposite-parity states such as the 4f(2)n(')g configuration which is treated by a closure procedure. Using this calculation method in combination with the experimental data from the absorption spectrum, a set of intensity parameters is obtained. The transition intensities originating from the high-lying (2)G(9/2)(2) level to the lower energy levels are then calculated, demonstrating a good agreement with the experimental results. The new calculation method is suitable for the electric dipole transitions within the 4f(N) configurations of trivalent lanthanide ions with more than two f-electrons.",

The energy storage traps for persistent phosphorescence in the system are analyzed based on the dependence of photoluminescence and persistent phosphorescence on sintering temperature. The distribution of energy storage traps is further characterized by thermoluminescence spectra and the parameters of the traps are calculated.

The broad emission band is attributed to the spin-forbidden transitions of the d-orbital electrons associated with the Mn2+ ions (4T1(4G)-6A1(6S)). The excitation and emission spectra of the samples with different dopants and doping concentrations show that the Mn2+ emission is dominantly due to the persistent energy transfer from Eu2+.

The spectral components emitting from the lowest and upper Stark levels of 4I13/2 state were distinguished by analyzing the spectra with normalized area. The effect of optical properties of the spectral components on the 1.5 \u03bcm emission bandwidth is investigated. The results indicate that to search for a host with higher spontaneous emission probability of the upper Stark levels of 4I13/2 state for Er 3+ ions is very important to broadening of the 1.5 \u03bcm emission band.

The decay processes of the red long persistent phosphorescence at 693 nm emission exhibit strong behavior of f-d band of Eu 2+ , indicating the occurrence of energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Cr 3+ . Lifetime measurements of the blue band show that the energy transfer rates increase with the increase of the Cr 3+ concentration. There are several phases observed in the strontium aluminates. Energy transfer occurs only for the Eu 2+ and Cr 3+ ions that located in the same phase in the host. In SrAl12O19 phase, the Eu 2+ ions emit blue light centered at 400 nm and prefer to transferring energy to the Cr 3+ that yields 688 nm emission, while in the Sr2Al6O11 and Sr4Al14O25 phases, the Eu 2+ ions emit at 460 and 490 nm, respectively, and transfer the energy to the Cr 3+ ions that give emission at 693 nm.

        "abstract": "The calcite and vaterite type LuBO 3:Eu 3+ nano/microcrystals with various morphologies were synthesized by the hydrothermal (HT) approach through controlling the pH values of the precursor solutions. The calcite type LuBO 3:Eu 3+ shows the dominant magnetic dipole 5D 0- 7F 1 emission due to S 6inversion symmetry of Lu. It also shows a symmetrical O-Eu charge transfer (CT) excitation band, which, however, is asymmetrical and broad in the material prepared by the solid-state (SS) reaction method. The effect of the residual OH - groups introduced in HT synthesis is discussed on O-Lu exciton annihilation and local environment distortion. Two different Eu 3+ centers, one of which is with inversion symmetry, are observed in vaterite type LuBO 3:Eu 3+. The HT sample with nanostructures, such as vaterite type flowerlike LuBO 3:Eu 3+, demonstrates a red shift of the CT band and appearance of a long excitation tail at the long wavelength side of the CT band. XRD, selective excitation and fluorescence decay measurements indicate that the red shift is induced by an increase of crystal lattice parameters, and the excitation tail is responsible to the Eu 3+ ions located at lower symmetric sites. These sites are attributed to the positions at or close to the surface of the nanostructures in the sample. As the lower symmetric sites are selectively excited, the red emission of 5D 0- 7F 2 of Eu 3+ enhanced twice relatively to the orange emission of 5D 0- 7F 1, exhibiting superior color chromaticity in red for display application. The luminescence properties of interior Eu 3+ and outside Eu 3+ are studied and discussed in detail. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

        "title": "The contribution of the coordinated water to 5D4 population in YPO4 hydrates doped with low concentration of Tb3+",
        "abstract": "This work reports the tunable emissions before and after dehydration in YPO 4 \u00b7 2H 2 O doped with low concentration of Tb 3+ synthesized via aqueous precipitation. The underlying mechanism is explored based on the fluorescent dynamics knowledge. Abstract This work reports an interesting result on the photoluminescence of YPO 4 \u00b7 2H 2 O doped with low concentration of Tb 3+ , which was synthesized at low temperature by aqueous route. In the as-synthesized Y 0.098 PO 4 :Tb 0.002 \u00b7 2H 2 O, in which the hydration water is coordinated to the rare earth ions, the emissions of 5 D 4 of Tb 3+ are much more intense than the emissions of 5 D 3 . After dehydration by annealing, an opposite result is achieved, i.e., the emissions of 5 D 4 of Tb 3+ are much lower than the emissions of 5 D 3 . The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and fluorescent decay spectra demonstrate that the coordinated water molecule in the hydrated sample contributes to the relaxation of 5 D 3 to 5 D 4 , thus increasing the population of the excited state 5 D 4 of Tb 3+ in the as-synthesized sample. Luminescent materials doped with rare-earth ions have been extensively investigated in the past a few decades because of their technological applications in lighting [1] , displays [2] , X-ray photography [3] , lasers [4] and amplifiers for fiber-optic communications [5] . Very recently, the researchers have also found their potential utility in biological detectors and biotechnology [6,7] , Therefore, interest in rare earth-doped luminescent materials grows continuously. The size, morphology, and structure are well known to have an impact on the luminescent properties of doped materials [8,9] . To obtain desirable luminescence properties, much effort has been made on the control of morphology and structure. For example, Jia et al. [8] have used an ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) assisted hydrothermal method to synthesize metastable-phased zircon-type LaVO 4 :Eu nanocrystals at low temperature, whose emission intensity is nine times as high as that of LaVO 4 :Eu with monazite-type structure that is prepared by the high-temperature solid-state reaction. In addition, the selection of the host matrix is also crucial since the luminescent properties and efficiencies can be strongly affected by various processes caused by the interaction between the rare-earth ions and the vibration of the host, such as nonradiative de-excitation and phonon-assisted energy transfer [10] . Therefore, the search for a suitable host material is a key to tailor the luminescent properties. For example, rare earth fluorides are shown to be good candidates as host materials due to low phonon energy, which decreases the nonradiative rate and thus increases the luminescent intensities [11] . Tb 3+ -doped materials can show bright blue or green light depending on the Tb 3+ concentration [12] . With a very low concentration of Tb 3+ doped into host matrix, the transition from 5 D 3 of Tb 3+ dominates and produces the blue emissions. With an increasing concentration of Tb 3+ doped into host matrix, a well-known cross relaxation process from 5 D 3 to 5 D 4 occurs [13] , and thus the emissions from 5 D 4 can be observed, which produce the green light. Tb 3+ -doped materials, including borates [14] , aluminates [15] , phosphates [13] , fluorides [11] and so on, have been widely investigated in the past a few decades. However, the photoluminescence of the hydrated materials doped with low concentration of Tb 3+ has not been reported yet, based on our present best knowledge. In this work, YPO 4 hydrates doped with low Tb 3+ concentration (Y 0.098 PO 4 :Tb 0.002 \u00b7 2H 2 O) was synthesized at low temperature by aqueous route, and an abnormal photoluminescence was observed and explained. The samples were prepared by aqueous precipitation as follows: appropriate amounts of high purity Y 2 O 3 and Tb 4 O 7 were dissolved in concentrated HNO 3 to form Y(III) and Tb(III) solutions, respectively. Appropriate volume of (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 solution was added slowly to above mentioned rare earth (III) solutions under vigorous stirring. The final pH value was adjusted to 1\u20132 by the addition of aqueous ammonia. The mixtures were vigorously stirred for 10 h at 60 \u00b0C. The resulting products were washed with ethanol and distilled water, and centrifuged at 8000 rpm. This process was repeated several times. The obtained precipitates were dried overnight at room temperature. XRD studies were conducted on a Rigaku D/max-2000 X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu K \u03b1 radiation. Infrared spectra of powders (FTIR) were recorded in the range of 600\u20134000 cm \u22121 on a Fourier-transform spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Spectrum 1, USA) with a resolution of 1 cm \u22121 . The powder samples were mixed with KBr, then pressed into a cylindrical die. The emission spectra at room temperature were measured with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer. The measurement of fluorescent decay was carried out with a third-harmonic generator pumped by the pulsed Nd:YAG at room temperature. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized sample and those heat-treated at various temperatures. It is noted that, the as-synthesized sample is well-crystalline, and that all of the peaks could be well indexed to the monoclinic YPO 4 \u00b7 2H 2 O with churchite-type structure and space group I2/a ( JCPDS File No. 85-1842 ). As the annealing temperature increases to 190 \u00b0C, an additional diffraction peak is observed, as marked by a specific symbol in Fig. 1 . This means that a new phase is involved in the monoclinic phased YPO 4 \u00b7 2H 2 O. Further increasing annealing temperature up to 250 \u00b0C, the phase with monoclinic churchite-type structure has almost totally disappeared, and a new phase, all of whose peaks could be well indexed to tetragonal dehydrated YPO 4 with xenotime-type structure and space group I4 l /amd ( JCPDS File No. 84-0335 ), is observed. Typical DTA plot of as-synthesized YPO 4 \u00b7 2H 2 O is given in the inset of Fig. 1 . A well-defined endothermic effect is observed due to dehydration in the temperature range 150\u2013290 \u00b0C peaking at 247 \u00b0C. This temperature is in good agreement with the structure transition temperature. This indicates that the dehydration really leads to the structural transition from monoclinic churchite-type YPO 4 \u00b7 2H 2 O to the dehydrated tetragonal xenotime-type YPO 4 . The above result indicates that the YPO 4 \u00b7 2H 2 O phase is metastable, which can commonly not be prepared by high-temperature synthesis route. Metastable-phased materials can usually be prepared under mild conditions at relatively low temperature [16,17] . Fig. 2 presents FTIR spectra of the as-synthesized sample and the sample annealed at 250 \u00b0C. In the investigated range of wavelength, the peak at about 650 cm \u22121 , the should at 910 cm \u22121 , and the band around 1050 cm \u22121 are indicative of the characteristic vibrations of phosphate groups [18] . What we are most interested in is the water vibrations, which have a close association with the photoluminescence to be investigated below. For the water vibrations, in addition to the wide bands extending from 2700 to 3700 cm \u22121 , the presences of two bands at 1640 and 1715 cm \u22121 and the band at 755 cm \u22121 indicated in Fig. 2 are indicative of the characteristic of coordinated water [16] , i.e., the hydration water molecule in the as-synthesized sample is bonded to the rare earth ions. For the sample annealed at 250 \u00b0C, the characteristic vibrations of coordinated water have been completely disappeared due to dehydration at this temperature. The band at 1650 cm \u22121 and the band around 3400 cm \u22121 are the characteristic vibrations of water molecule in air physically adsorbed at the sample surface, which is completely different from coordinated water in nature. Tb 3+ has a relatively simple 4f-configurational energy level structure: low-energy state, 7 F j ( j = 6, \u2026 , 0) and excited states 5 D 3 and 5 D 4 [15] . Generally, with a very low concentration of Tb 3+ doped into host matrix, the transitions of 5 D 3 to 7 F j dominate and produce the blue emissions [12] . With increasing Tb concentration, the cross relaxation from 5 D 3 to 5 D 4 occurs due to the interaction between the neighboring Tb 3+ ions [13] , which increases the population of 5 D 4 energy level, correspondingly, enhancing the transitions of 5 D 4 to 7 F j , which emit green light. In order to observe the 5 D 3 emissions of Tb 3+ , low concentration Tb 3+ -doped YPO 4 \u00b7 2H 2 O, Y 0.098 PO 4 :Tb 0.002 \u00b7 2H 2 O, was synthesized in this work. Fig. 3 shows the emissions spectra of the as-synthesized hydrated sample and the dehydrated sample annealed at 250 \u00b0C. Both consist of lines ranging from 350 to 630 nm, which originate from the transitions between different f-electron states of Tb 3+ , i.e., from the excited 5 D 3 and 5 D 4 to the 7 F j ground states, respectively. Among which, the emissions at 380, 416, 436, 458, and 472 nm originate from the transitions from 5 D 3 , and those at 490, 544, 588, and 622 nm originate from the transitions from 5 D 4 , [13] as indicated in Fig. 3 . Interestingly, one can observe a noticeable difference in the relative emission intensity of 5 D 3 and 5 D 4 for these two samples. For the as-synthesized sample, relatively weak emission from 5 D 3 and relatively strong emission from 5 D 4 are observed, but for the annealed sample, an opposite result is achieved, i.e., relatively strong emissions from 5 D 3 in contrast to those from 5 D 4 . Taking into account that both samples contain the same nominal Tb 3+ concentration, what results in this noticeable difference in the ratio of 5 D 3 emissions to 5 D 4 emissions between these two samples? The earlier XRD and FTIR spectra show the presence of coordinated water in the as-synthesized hydrated sample, but the coordinated water is completely removed due to the dehydration in the sample annealed at 250 \u00b0C. The difference of photoluminescence mentioned above is probably related to the coordinated water. FTIR spectrum of as-synthesized sample shows high vibrational frequency of OH groups in the range from 2700 to 3700 cm \u22121 due to the presence of coordinated water. The energy separation between 5 D 3 and 5 D 4 is about 6500 cm \u22121 , which may be bridged well by only two OH phonons. Based on the theory of multiphonon relaxation, this makes the 5 D 3 \u2013 5 D 4 relaxation process by the bridge of OH phonons highly probable. Therefore, the population of the excited state 5 D 4 of Tb 3+ originates from two channels for the as-synthesized sample. On one hand, it results from the energy transfer from 5 D 3 \u2192 5 D 4 of one Tb 3+ to 7 F 6 \u2192 7 D 0 of another Tb 3+ , a cross-relaxation process, as indicated in Fig. 4 a; on the other hand, it results from the 5 D 3 \u2192 5 D 4 relaxation though the decay of OH phonon, as indicated in Fig. 4 b. These two processes contribute to the increase of the population of the excited state 5 D 4 of Tb 3+ , and correspondingly, decrease the 5 D 3 population for the as-synthesized hydrated sample. But for the annealed sample, due to the removal of coordinated water, only a single cross-relaxation process from 5 D 3 \u2192 5 D 4 to 7 F 6 \u2192 7 F 0 is contributive to the population of the excited state 5 D 4 . Therefore, the ratio of the population of 5 D 4 to that of 5 D 3 in the as-synthesized hydrated sample is much higher than that in the sample annealed at 250 \u00b0C. This may well explain the difference in the ratio of 5 D 3 emissions to 5 D 4 emissions in these two samples. As a matter of fact, the relaxation of 5 D 3 to 5 D 4 by the coordinated water can be estimated by the fluorescent decay of 5 D 3 . The fluorescent decay curves of 5 D 3 for these two samples are given and compared in Fig. 5 . As expected, the luminescence of 5 D 3 of these two samples shows nonexponential decay behavior. For the sample annealed at 250 \u00b0C, this nonexponential decay originates primarily from the cross relaxation due to the interaction between Tb 3+ ions, from 5 D 3 \u2192 5 D 4 of one Tb 3+ to 7 F 6 \u2192 7 F 0 of another Tb 3+ . However, it is worth noting that the luminescence decay deviates much more from single-exponential behavior for the as-synthesized sample ( Fig. 5 b), in contrast to the annealed sample. This indicates that, except for the cross relaxation, there should exist another nonradiative relaxation route that can also leads to the depopulation of 5 D 3 for the as-synthesized sample. As demonstrated earlier, in the as-synthesized sample, the hydration water coordinated to the rare earth ions presents the intense vibration in the range from 2700 to 3700 cm \u22121 , and the energy separation of 5 D 3 \u2013 5 D 4 matches the two OH phonons well. Thus, the 5 D 3 \u2192 5D 4 decay by OH phonon relaxation becomes probable. Therefore, in the as-synthesized sample that contains the coordinated water, the cooperative contributions of the cross relaxation and OH phonon relaxation decrease the population of 5 D 3 considerably, but relatively increase the population of 5 D 4 . This may support the result on the difference in photoluminescence of the samples before and after dehydration. The decay rate W for excited level 5 D 3 of Tb 3+ ion in crystalline matrices may be approximated by the sum of a radiative transition rate ( W R ), multiphonon relaxation rate ( W MP ) and the cross-relaxation rate between Tb 3+ ( W CR ). Thus, W can be written as W = W R + W MP + W CR In the dehydrated YPO 4 :Tb, the excited levels of 5 D 3 are depopulated by radiative transition and cross-relaxation processes. However, in the as-prepared YPO 4 :Tb2H 2 O containing coordinated water, there increases another pathway depopulating the 5 D 3 level by the interaction of the 5 D 3 level of Tb 3+ with the vibrations of coordinated water due to the energy matching. This is evidenced by the variations of optical spectra ( Fig. 3 ) and fluorescent decay ( Fig. 5 ). Furthermore, from a large change of the ratio of 5 D 4 emissions to 5 D 3 emissions before and after dehydration, it is not difficult to conclude that the coordinated water possesses a large contribution to the relaxation of 5 D 3 of Tb 3+ to 5 D 4 . In summary, we have used the aqueous route to synthesize low concentration Tb 3+ -doped YPO 4 \u00b7 2H 2 O, in which the hydration water is coordinated to the rare earth ions. In the as-synthesized sample, in addition to a well-known cross-relaxation process, an additional process, the 5 D 3 \u2192 5 D 4 relaxation by coordinated water vibration, also contributes to the increase of 5 D 4 population. This ultimately leads to unusual photoluminescence phenomenon, that is, the ratio of the emissions from 5 D 4 to the emission from 5 D 3 in the as-synthesized sample is much higher than that in the sample annealed at 250 \u00b0C, in which, the coordinated water is removed completely.

The initial phosphorescence in the nanophosphor is an order of magnitude stronger than that in the bulk at the corresponding quenching concentrations.

The photo-upconverted radiative emission was observed and believed to result from the radiative recombination of the second excited singlet state. Intensity of the upconverted luminescence was found to be saturated as a function of excitation intensity. Optical limiting associated with reverse saturable absorption was observed. These effects are attributed to the higher excited state absorption. A method for determining absorption cross-section of excited states was developed by using dynamic calculation to fit the intensity dependence of upconverted intensity. The absorption cross sections of the excited singlet and triplet state were estimated.",

Their structure and luminescent properties were studied and compared with each other. The nanocrystalline Y2O3 were cubic in symmetry by XRD pattern. It can be concluded that co-doping can modify the size and crystallinity of nanoparticles. As a consequence, the luminescent properties such as the fluorescent intensity, lifetime of 5D0-7F2 and the location of charge transfer band (CT band) vary with co-dopants. The variation depends more strongly on the crystallinity of nanoparticles than the size. Especially, in Li+-doped Y2O3:Eu nanoparticles, the emission intensity improves as large as three times than that of undoped ones.",

        "abstract": "Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers(EDFAs) with wide and flat gain spectra in telecommunication windows are the key issues for dense wavelength division multiplexing(DWDM) optical network systems.How-(ever),the traditional commercialized EDFAs are made of SiO_2-based material in which Er~(3+) ions show a narrow (emission) bandwidth for the ~4I_(13/2)\u2192~4I_(15/2) transition.Many methods have been investigated to broaden and flatten the gain spectra of the traditional EDFAs in order to meet the capacity demand.Recently,tellurite glasses have received considerable attention in EDFAs for the broad bandwidth of over 70 nm,which meets the transmission capacity of DWDM systems.Nevertheless,the bad thermal stability and the high up-conversion become the(unsolvable) obstacle.Compared to tellurite,borate is a better glass-former compound and has higher(stability),larger phonon energy and broad bandwidth.We prepared Er~(3+) doped Bi_2O_3-B_2O_3-SiO_2 glasses according to the following molar composition: 40% Bi_2O_3,20% B_2O_3,40% SiO_2,and 3.0% Er_2O_3 is added to dope the glasses.The absorption spectra for Er~(3+) and OH~-group,emission spectra and luminous decay for the transition ~4I_(13/2)\u2192~4I_(15/2) were measured.Accor-(ding) to the standard J-O procedure the intensity parameters for the Er~(3+) in the prepared glass were obtained.The concentration of OH~-group and inner quantum efficiency for ~4I_(13/2) level were estimated.It is validated that the lower quantum efficiency is caused by the higher content of OH~-group,about 3 times of Er~(3+)(content.) On the base of McCumber theory,the stimulated emission cross section for the ~4I_(13/2) level was derived and found to be in better agreement with the results calculated by using the emission spectra.We draw a conclusion that it is essential for the borate used in EDFAs to decrease the higher content of OH~-group despite of higher stability,larger phonon energy and broad bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "Er3+-doped Gd2O3-SiO2 -B2O3-Na2O glasses were prepared, and formation range of glass of Gd2O3-SiO2 -B2O3 system was experimentally obtained. It is found that the glass phase can be formed only when the content of SiO2 is 0-50% (molar fraction), Gd2O3 is 0-30% (molar fraction) and B2O3 is above 20% (molar fraction) in this glass system. The glass can also be obtained but becomes translucent at the contents of 60% (molar fraction) SiO2 and 30% Gd2O3, or at the contents of 60% (molar fraction) SiO2 and 30% (molar fraction) B2O3. There is no glass phase formed in other glass components. Glass forming ability for Gd2O3 content of 10%, was characterized by the value of \u03b2, the parameter of crystallization tendency, which is 0.32-1.76, obtained from the differential thermal analysis. The absorption and emission cross section, the J-O parameters \u03a9t(2, 4, 6) and radiative transition probabilities were calculated by using the theory of McCumber and Judd-Ofelt. The emission properties at 1.5 \u03bcm of the samples are discussed with the product of full width at half maximum and stimulated emission cross section. It can be seen that the value of the FWHM \u00d7 \u03c3e peak product in the prepared glass is more than those of germanate, silicate and phosphate glasses. Furthermore, the maximum value of the product among these glasses reported in this work is close to that of oxyfluoride silicate glass. Therefore, the Er3+-doped gadolinium borosilicate glass in this paper is a candidate for broadband erbium doped fiber amplifiers.",

We observed long lasting yellow phosphorescence in Sr3SiO5: Eu2+ and SrSiO5: Eu2+, Dy3+ phosphors, originating from 4f65d-4f7 transition of Eu2+, after UV exposure. The phosphorescence in Sr3SiO5: Eu2+ can be observed by naked eyes for more than 4 hours after the termination of excitation light. The decay patterns of phosphorescence and thermoluminescence curves demonstrate that introduction of Dy3+ into Sr3SiO5: Eu2+ can generate lots of shallow traps and deep traps. The generated deep traps prolong the phosphorescence up to 6 hours after UV irradiation. The depths of traps are obtained by fitting the thermoluminescence experimental data to the general order kinetics formula.",

The crystal phase evolution and correlated photoluminescence properties are studied as a function of Ca 2+ content based on the experimental measurements of X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence and fluorescence decay. Our results indicate that Sr 2-xCa xP 2O 7:Eu 2+ crystallize in single \u03b1-Sr 2P 2O 7 type phase for x \u2264 0.75. As increasing x from 0.75, \u03b1-Ca 2P 2O 7 type phase starts to form and increase followed by reduction of \u03b1-Sr 2P 2O 7 type phase. The single \u03b1-Ca 2P 2O 7 type phase is obtained only at x = 2. The emission band (band I) in \u03b1-Sr 2P 2O 7 type phase and that (band II) in \u03b1-Ca 2P 2O 7 type phase both shift to the red on increasing x due to enhancement of crystal field strength in case of Ca 2+ substitution for Sr 2+. This substitution also leads to remarkably inhomogeneous broadening of band I, within which energy transfer from the high energy Eu 2+ to the low energy one is observed. The superposition of band I and band II results in various distributions of intense emission band including the redshifted and more broadened ones suitable for white light generation. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The phase transformation from the hydrated YPO 4 :Tb with monoclinic churchite structure to the dehydrated YPO 4 :Tb with tetragonal xenotime structure occurs in the annealing process. The structural change induced by the phase transformation results in a remarkable difference in the luminescent efficiency.

The results showed that non-agglomeration phosphors with regular morphology and fine size were produced after the mixture being calcined at 800\u00b0C for 4 h with 3% NH4F as flux. The main emission peak of the samples is at 613 nm. The excitation spectrum showed that this phosphor can be effectively excited by ultraviolet (UVX395 nm) and blue (465 nm) light, nicely fitting in with the widely applied output wavelengths of ultraviolet or blue LED chips.

Keywords Chlorosilicate phosphor Energy transfer White LEDs 1 Introduction Phosphor converted white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are regarded as the next generation light sources because of their high luminous efficiency, long lifetimes, environment friendly features, etc. [1] . At present most of the LED phosphors are activated singly doped luminescent materials such as Ce 3+ doped garnets (typically Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce 3+ ) [2,3] , Eu 2+ doped silicates [4,5] , and nitrides and oxynitrides [6\u20139] While doubly doped luminescent material based energy transfer is an alternative for white LED phosphors [10\u201313] . This type of phosphor in principle can provide full color emission without phosphor blend. Eu 2+ activated chlorosilicate luminescent materials exhibit highly efficient luminescence in blue/green spectral region [14\u201318] . Co-doping Mn 2+ as a yellow or longer wavelength emitting center in several chlorosilicate phosphors has been studied through energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ to generate white light. Ding et al. [19] studied luminescence properties of Ca 3 SiO 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ that which a green emission band at 512 nm of Eu 2+ and a yellow band at 570 nm of Mn 2+ . White LEDs are fabricated by combining this phosphor with near-ultraviolet chips. Fang et al. [20] studied luminescence properties of Ca 8 Mg(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ which shows a green band at 505 nm and a yellow band at 540 nm. In our previous work, we synthesized a series of intense green emitting (505 nm) phosphors Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ that is suitable for either UV or blue LED excitations [21] . Especially, Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ can emit green light stronger than Ca 8 Mg(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ and Ca 3 SiO 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ under blue light excitation. As a result, it is expected that an intense green/yellow emission could be achieved in Eu 2+ and Mn 2+ co-doped Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 materials. Although Lin et al. [22] have mentioned the energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ in Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 host, there has been no research on the luminescence of Eu 2+ and Mn 2+ in Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 for blue LEDs published, nor a systematic study on energy transfer reported in the literature. In this paper, Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ is synthesized and its luminescence properties and energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ are investigated. It is demonstrated that Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ can be effectively excited by blue light to emit strong green/yellow light in comparison with Ca 3 SiO 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ and Ca 8 Mg(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ phosphors. 2 Experimental The Ca 8\u2212 x Zn 1\u2212 y (SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 (CZSC): x Eu 2+ , y Mn 2+ phosphors were synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The constituent oxides or carbonates CaCO 3 (99.9%), CaCl 2 (99.9%), SiO 2 (99.9%), ZnO(99.9%), Eu 2 O 3 (99.99%), and MnCO 3 (99.99%) were employed as the raw materials, which were mixed homogeneously by an agate mortar for 30 min, placed in a crucible with a lid, and then sintered in a tubular furnace at 900 \u00b0C for 4 h in reductive atmosphere (10% H 2 +90% N 2 mixed flowing gas). An excess of CaCl 2 and ZnO was added to the reactants when the phosphors were synthesized. The synthesis procedure of samples Ca 3 SiO 4 Cl 2 (CSC) and Ca 8 Mg(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 (CMSC) are similar to that described previously [16,18] . Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb =1.54056 \u00c5) on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a linear position-sensitive detector (PSD-50m, M. Braun), operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with a step size of 0.02\u00b0 (2 \u03b8 ) in the range of 15\u201375\u00b0. The measurements of photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra were performed using a Hitachi F4500 spectrometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp under a working voltage of 700 V. The excitation and emission slits were both set at 2.5 nm. In fluorescence lifetime measurements the third harmonic (355 nm) of an Nd-doped yttrium aluminum garnet pulsed laser (Spectra- Physics, GCR 130) was used as an excitation source, and the signals were detected with a Tektronix digital oscilloscope (TDS 3052). 3 Result and discussion Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of CZSC:0.15Eu 2+ and CZSC:0.15Eu 2+ , 0.05Mn 2+ . The main XRD peaks are in good agreement with the standard data of JCPDS No. 39-1421. Some weak impurity peaks are also observable, which are assigned to the Ca 3 SiO 4 Cl 2 phase and marked with circle symbols. The intensity of impurity phases is too small that the effect on luminescence and energy transfer of CZSC:Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ could be neglected. The PLE and PL spectra of CZSC:0.15Eu 2+ , CZSC:0.05Mn 2+ and CZSC:0.15Eu 2+ , 0.05Mn 2+ are shown in Fig. 2 . CZSC:0.15Eu 2+ shows a green emission band at about 505 nm, which corresponds to the 5d\u21924f transition of Eu 2+ . The excitation spectrum monitored at 505 nm shows a broad PLE band within the 300\u2013470 nm range, which is due to the transition from the 4f 7 ground state to the 4f 6 5d 1 excited state of Eu 2+ ( Fig. 2 (a)). CZSC:0.05Mn 2+ phosphor presents a broad emission band at 550 nm, which corresponds to the 4 T 1 ( 4 G)\u2192 6 A 1 ( 6 S) transition of Mn 2+ ( Fig. 2 (b)). The intensity of the Mn 2+ emission is much weaker than that of Eu 2+ due to the forbidden d\u2013d transition of Mn 2+ . Obviously, there is a significant spectral overlap between the Eu 2+ PL and Mn 2+ PLE spectra, which implies the possibility of energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ . ( Fig. 2 (c)) illustrates the PLE and PL spectra of CZSC:0.15Eu 2+ , 0.05Mn 2+ . It is found that the PLE spectrum of the yellow emission of Mn 2+ is similar to that of the green emission of Eu 2+ , demonstrating the existence of energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ in CZSC. In addition the PL and PLE spectra shape resembling Ca 3 SiO 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ is not observed, further confirming that the impurity phases have little effect on the PL spectra and energy transfer. CZSC:0.15Eu 2+ , 0.05Mn 2+ exhibits a broad and strong PLE band extended to 470 nm, covering almost the full UV\u2013blue region, indicating that CZSC:Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ can be used as a promising phosphor with green and yellow components applied to near UV and/or blue LED based white LEDs. Fig. 3 shows the normalized emission spectra of Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ co-doped CZSC with various Mn 2+ concentrations ( y =0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1). Here, the remarkable enhancements of the yellow band relative to green band are observed with increasing Mn 2+ concentration. The fluorescence lifetimes of Eu 2+ ( \u03c4 1 ) and Mn 2+ ( \u03c4 2 ) with different Mn 2+ concentrations are presented in Fig. 4 . The fluorescence lifetimes of Eu 2+ ( \u03c4 1 ) reduce and tend to be nonexponential functions with increasing Mn 2+ concentrations, reflecting the characteristics of energy transfer between donors and acceptors [23] . The energy transfer efficiencies ( \u03b7 T ) are calculated using the equation \u03b7 T =1\u2013 \u03c4 1 / \u03c4 0 and presented in Fig. 5 where \u03c4 0 is fluorescence lifetime of Eu 2+ in the absence of Mn 2+ . With increasing Mn 2+ dopant content, \u03b7 T was found to increase gradually and reach 30% for Mn 2+ concentration of 10%. Based on energy transfer, the dependences of the emission intensity ratios of Mn 2+ to Eu 2+ on Mn 2+ concentration are calculated by the measured fluorescence lifetimes of Eu 2+ ( \u03c4 1 ) and Mn 2+ ( \u03c4 2 ). Under steady excitation, the rate equations describing the energy transfers from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ can be written as follows: (1) W Eu - Mn n 1 = n 2 / \u03c4 2 where n 1 and n 2 are the populations of Eu 2+ and Mn 2+ ions, respectively; The energy transfer rates ( W Eu - Mn ) can be obtained using the equation: (2) W Eu - Mn = 1 / \u03c4 1 \u2212 1 / \u03c4 0 Since the fluorescence intensity of a specific level is equal to the product of the population and the radiative rate of the level, using Eq. (1) , the dependences of the intensity ratio of the yellow to green emissions on Mn 2+ concentrations can be written as (3) I Y I G = W Eu \u2212 Mn \u03b3 2 \u03c4 2 \u03b3 1 where \u03b3 1 and \u03b3 2 are radiative rates of Eu 2+ and Mn 2+ , respectively, which are independent of Mn 2+ concentrations. W Eu\u2013Mn has been calculated according to Eq. (2) . \u03c4 2 has been measured and presented in Fig. 4 . Therefore, the intensity ratios I Y / I G at various Mn 2+ concentrations can be calculated using Eq. (3) and scaled to the maximum, as shown in Fig. 6 . For comparison, the intensity ratios obtained directly from the emission spectra are also given in Fig. 6 . It can be seen that the calculated data based on lifetimes are in good agreement with the experimental ones based on PL spectra, clearly demonstrating that the energy of the yellow emission of Mn 2+ is derived from energy transfer from Eu 2+ . Fig. 7 shows comparable PL and PLE spectra of (a) Eu 2+ singly doped and (b) Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ co-doped CSC, CMSC and CZSC phosphors. It can be seen that CZSC:Eu 2+ shows efficient emission at 505 nm under 450 nm light excitation in ( Fig. 7 (a)), which is consistent with our previous results. According to the previous result reported by Ding et al.[19], they choose CSC:0.09Eu 2+ , 0.12Mn 2+ to fabricate LED with the UV chip. So, in this work, CSC:0.09Eu 2+ , 0.12Mn 2+ phosphor was also synthesized. Compared with the CSC:0.09Eu 2+ , 0.12Mn 2+ , the CZSC:0.15Eu 2+ , 0.05Mn 2+ shows stronger luminescence intensity than CSC in the application for blue LED. As for CMSC:0.15Eu 2+ , 0.05Mn 2+ we notice that the PL peak position at 545 nm in CMSC:Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ shifts toward the red side by 5 nm in CZSC:Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ , exhibiting a larger crystal field splitting in CZSC:Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ . The larger crystal field splitting might be caused by a smaller cell volume in CZSC than CMSC because the effective ionic radius for Zn (CN=4) is 0.60 nm and that for Mg (CN=4) is 0.71 nm. The crystal lattices thereby exert larger crystal field on Mn 2+ ions in CZSC than CMSC. As a result, we can demonstrate that CZSC:Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ is a potential greenish-yellow phosphor for blue LED based white light devices. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have prepared Eu 2+ and Mn 2+ activated Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 phosphors by the high-temperature solid state reaction method. Two emission bands are observed: the one observed at 505 nm is attributed to Eu 2+ occupying the Ca 2+ sites and the other band at 550 nm originates from Mn 2+ occupying Zn 2+ sites. Luminescence and energy transfer in Eu 2+ and Mn 2+ co-doped Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 are investigated. The ratio of intensities of the yellow emission (550 nm) to the green (505 nm) obtained from emission spectra is consistent with the theoretical calculation based on energy transfer and lifetime measurements. The luminescence intensity of Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ is compared with related phosphors, indicating that Ca 8 Zn(SiO 4 ) 4 Cl 2 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ could be a promising green-yellow phosphor for blue LED based white LEDs.

Long persistent phosphorescence in green, yellow, and red have been observed in the systems with persistence time over 10 h for the green (525 nm) and the yellow (550 nm) and 4 h for the red (660 nm). Emission and excitation spectra showed that Mn 2+ emission was dominant in these materials. Long persistent phosphorescence was also measured in the systems without Mn 2+ as a co-dopant. The emissions were much stronger due to 5d\u20134f transitions in Ce 3+ and Eu 2+ other than 3d\u20133d transitions in Mn 2+ . The disappearances of the long persistent afterglow in these systems when co-doped with Mn 2+ suggested the existence of a strong persistent energy transfer from Ce 3+ and Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ . Keywords Mn 2+ Keywords Mn 2+ Persistent phosphors Energy transfer 1 Introduction Oxide long-persistent phosphors have been synthesized in recent years. They have better formability and longer persistent time compared to previous sulfide phosphors. The activated emission centers, however, are limited in rare earth ions. The examples are SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ , CaAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2+ , Nd 3+ and CaAl 2 O 4 :Tb 3+ , Ce 3+ crystalline materials [1\u20133] and Tb 3+ or Eu 2+ doped glass systems [4\u20136] . Long-lasting phosphorescence has also been reported recently in Ce 3+ -doped Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 and CaYAl 3 O 7 melilite crystals [7,8] . Transition metal ions have been widely used in luminescent materials, e.g., Mn 2+ , a transition metal center, has been doped into more than 500 inorganic hosts [9] for luminescence with emission range from 490 to 750 nm. However, to our knowledge, they have not been yet applied to persistent phosphors. In this paper, we introduce Mn 2+ , a transition metal, as emission centers for long persistent phosphors. CaAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ , Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ , and MgSiO 3 :Mn 2+ , Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ co-doped samples have been prepared, yielding different emission colors because of the sensitivity of the Mn 2+ ions to the crystal fields. The Mn 2+ emissions are due to the persistent energy transfer from the rare earth ions. Emission and excitation spectra have been investigated and the persistent time has been measured. Long persistent phosphorescence in green, yellow, and red have been observed in the systems with persistence time over 10 h for the green (525 nm) and the yellow (550 nm) and 4 h for the red (660 nm). 2 Experimental CaAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ , Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ , and MgSiO 3 :Mn 2+ , Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ co-doped samples were prepared by mixing the co-dopant compounds together with the host ingredient and sintering. Powder materials of 99.99% purity were used throughout. The receipts of these three materials are listed below: CaCO 3 +Al 2 O 3 +0.5 at% Ce 2 (CO 3 ) 3 +1 at% MnO\u2013CaAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2+ ,Ce 3+ 2CaCO 3 +Al 2 O 3 +SiO 2 +1 at% Ce 2 (CO 3 ) 3 +2 at% MnO\u2013Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 :Mn 2+ ,Ce 3+ MgO+SiO 2 +0.5 at% Eu 2 O 3 +1.5 at% Dy 2 O 3 +1 at% MnO\u2013MgSiO 3 :Mn 2+ ,Eu 2+ ,Dy 3+ A proper amount of B 2 O 3 was added to serve as flux. The mixtures were pressed into pellets and sintered at 900\u00b0C for 2 h. The pellets were ground to power form, mixed and pressed into pellets again. The CaAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2+ ,Ce 3+ and Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 :Mn 2+ ,Ce 3+ pellets were sintered at 1350\u00b0C for 5 h in a reducing gas flow (5 at% H 2 +N 2 ). The MgSiO 3 :Mn 2+ ,Eu 2+ ,Dy 3+ pellets were sintered at 1200\u00b0C also for 5 h in reducing gas flow (5 at% H 2 +N 2 ). The emission and excitation spectra were measured with a FluoroMax II spectrometer The afterglow spectra were recorded with a spectrometer or with an EG&G CCD spectrograph. The detection was gated at various delays following excitation. The afterglow decay curves were taken with Spex 500M spectrometer and PMT after the samples were irradiated with a 50 W mercury lamp for 10 min. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the excitation (solid lines) and emission (dashed lines) for the three co-doped systems, CaAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ ( Fig. 1A ), Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ ( Fig. 1B ), and MgSiO 3 :Mn 2+ , Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ ( Fig. 1C ). In these phosphors, Mn 2+ ions locate in the weak crystal field of Dq \u22451 so the emissions correspond to the 4 T 1 ( 4 G)\u2192 6 A 1 ( 6 S) transition [10] . For excitation spectra, the peaks between 400 and 500 nm are contributions by Mn 2+ absorption. In Fig. 1A , for instance, the three major peaks are the transitions of 6 A 1 ( 6 S)\u2192 4 T 1 ( 4 G) (490 nm), 6 A 1 ( 6 S) \u2192 4 T 2 ( 4 G) (450 nm), and 6 A 1 ( 6 S)\u2192 4 E( 4 G)/ 4 A( 4 G) (425 nm), which have been identified in other host [11] ; The peaks between 300 and 400 nm are attributed to the absorption of both Mn 2+ and rare earth ions; For the absorption below 300 nm, it is mostly due to Ce 3+ ions in Fig. 2A and B and due to Eu 2+ in Fig. 1C . The three systems are excited at 448, 412, and 413 nm, with emission peaks at 525, 550, and 660 nm in Fig. 1A\u2013C , respectively. The three emission wavelengths were monitored when the excitation spectra were recorded for the corresponding systems. Fig. 2 represents the afterglow emission for CaAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ (A), Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ (B), and MgSiO 3 :Mn 2+ , Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ (C) recorded at 5 s after UV irradiation for 10 min. The UV radiation fills the traps created by the rare earth ions. The positions and the profiles of the afterglow emissions are consistent with the Mn 2+ emission spectra recorded in Fig. 1 . Fig. 3 depicts the decays for the persistence fluorescence. The horizontal straight-line represents the limit of eye detection. The intrinsic radiative decay time of Mn 2+ doped in most crystals is in the order of 100 ms or less. A typical one, the decay of Mn 2+ emission at 525 nm in CaAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ system is given in the inset in Fig. 3 with lifetime of 5.5 ms. The afterglow emission must be due to the persistence energy transfer from the rare earth ions. The tail at the later time is due to the afterglow emission since the decay was measured under 266 nm UV excitation. Long persistent phosphorescence in green (525 nm) and yellow (550 nm) are observed for over 10 h and in red (660 nm) for over 4 h. The function of Dy 3+ is to create hole-trapped centers in the MgSiO 3 :Mn 2+ , Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ system [1] , where the Mn 2+ received energy from the excitation of the electron-hole pairs. Fig. 4 gives the comparison of the excitation (solid line) and emission (dashed lines) from CaAl 2 O 4 :Ce 3+ singly doped system (A) with that from CaAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ (B) co-doped system. For both Fig. 4A and B , the emissions were collected under the same excitation, i.e., \u03bb ex =362 nm, which is close to the maximum absorption of Ce 3+ but relatively weak for Mn 2+ absorption (in the dip between the two Mn 2+ absorption peaks at 260 and 384 nm, respectively). For Fig. 4A , \u03bb em =412 nm, which is the typical Ce 3+ emission, while for Fig 4B , \u03bb em =522 nm, corresponding to the emission of Mn 2+ and the emission of Ce 3+ clearly disappeared. The excitation of Ce 3+ efficiently and persistently transfers to Mn 2+ ions. The similar effect has also been observed in MgSiO 3 :Mn 2+ , Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ system. 4 Conclusions CaAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ , Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 :Mn 2+ , Ce 3+ , and MgSiO 3 :Mn 2+ , Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ co-doped phosphor samples have been prepared and Mn 2+ afterglow emissions in the systems have been investigated. The Mn 2+ emissions are due to the persistent energy transfer from the co-doped rare earth ions. Persistence times for phosphorescence have been observed for over 10 h for the green (525 nm) and the yellow (550 nm) and 4 h for the red (660 nm).

        "abstract": "The Er~(3+) doped tellurite up-conversion laser materials have been attracted much attention due to the applications in areas such as optoelectronics,optic-communication,and color display.The up-conversion(emission) efficiency of tellurite glasses is low,because of the multi-phonon relaxation.A simpler way of(removing) the OH~-from the glass during melting is to add a metal-fluoride to the batch and the fluoride will liberate hydrogen species from the melt.However,this process is effective in the dry air.In the humid(atmosphere,) water in the air can be reacted with fluoride to make the oxyfluoride tellutite glass with the(residual) OH~-.So the oxyfluoride tellurite glasses prepared in different air have different OH~-concentration.The oxyfluoride tellurite glasses with different OH~-concentration were prepared in dry air and in humid(atmosphere.) The Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters and the total spontaneous emissions probabilities A_(ij),(branching) ratios \u03b2_(ij) and radiative lifetimes of the major emitting states of the Er~(3+) ion were determined from the absorption spectrum and Judd-Ofelt theory.The OH~-concentration of oxyfluoride tellurite glasses was studied by the Fourier transform infrared(FTIR) absorption spectra.The effect of OH~-on green up-conversion luminescence in the Er~(3+)-doped oxyfluoride tellurite glasses was studied by fluorescence decay curves and up-conversion luminescence spectra.The OH~-concentration of oxyfluoride tellurite glass prepared in dry air is(0.017\u00d7)10~(-20) cm~(-3),15 times lower than that of glass prepared in humid atmosphere(0.25\u00d710~(-20) cm~(-3)).The Er~(3+) ion ~4S_(3/2) level lifetime of glass with lower OH~-concentration is 60 \u03bcs increasing 40% than that of glass with(higher) OH~-concentration,and the 543 nm emission intensity increases 2.4 times.The up-conversion luminescence of Er~(3+) doped oxyfluoride tellurite glasses prepared in removing the OH~-process has a great improvement.",

According to X-ray diffraction, this material belonged to a tetragonal system with space group I41/a. The effects of flux content and sintering temperature on the luminescent properties were investigated with the emission and excitation spectra. The results showed that flux content and sintering temperature had effects on the luminescent properties, the optimized flux content and the best temperature was 3% and 800 \u2103, respectively. The excitation and emission spectra also showed that this phosphor could be effectively excited by C-T band (280 nm), ultraviolet light 395 nm and blue light 465 nm. The wavelengths at 395 and 465 nm were nicely fitting in with the widely applied output wavelengths of ultraviolet or blue LED chips. Integrated emission intensity of Gd2Mo3O9\u2236Eu was twice higher than that of Y2O2S\u2236Eu3+ under 395 nm excitation.

Results indicated that in solution-based co-precipitation route, a lower temperature was required, no grinding and milling processes were introduced, and the starting materials were mixed at molecular level, compared with conventional solid-state reaction route. Therefore, the phosphor particles obtained from solution-based co-precipitation route had several advantages in the morphology, such as excellent surface quality, almost spherical shape, narrow size distribution, and homogeneous composition. The excitation spectrum measurement showed that YPO4 hosts had high energy absorption in VUV range, which makes it possible that YPO4:Tb phosphors are used in a PDP. The emission spectrum of YPO4:Tb under 147 nm excitation indicated that the phosphor powders obtained from solution-based co-precipitation route had high luminance since they have excellent morphologies and homogeneous composition, compared with those obtained from conventional solid-state reaction route. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Infrared spectra and lifetimes of 4 I 13/2 state of Er 3+ in tungsten\u2013tellurite glasses doped with different concentrations of Er 2 O 3 were measured and studied. Judd\u2013Ofelt analysis on absorption spectra was performed. The lifetime of the 4 I 13/2 state decreases with the increase of the Er 3+ concentration due to energy transfer processes. The energy transfer coefficient of 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u221218 cm 3 s \u22121 was obtained. It is observed that the nonradiative relaxation rate of 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 transition of Er 3+ in tungsten\u2013tellurite glass is unchanged with the increase of Er 3+ concentration, and about twice as that in TeO 2 \u2013ZnO\u2013Na 2 O glass. PACS 42.70.C 78.20.C 81.05.Pj 74.25.Gz Keywords Erbium Glasses Nonradiative decay 1 Introduction In order to increase the transmission capacity in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems, many glass matrices [1\u20133] have been investigated extensively to obtain an intrinsically broader gain bandwidth than silica matrix for Er 3+ -doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). Compared with silica, Er 3+ -doped tellurite glass [4] has a broader emission band at 1.5 \u03bcm and a larger stimulated emission cross-section. A tellurite glass based fiber with 76 nm flat gain bands was reported in 1997 [5] . In addition, Er 3+ solubility in tellurite glass is better than that in silica, making it possible to have a higher doping level. However, as a host for EDFA, tellurite glass has some drawbacks. First, the softening point of tellurite glass is 290 \u00b0C, which makes it liable to thermal damage at high optical intensities. Second, the phonon energy of the glass is about 770 cm \u22121 , which leads to a 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 nonradiative relaxation rate too slow to allow pumping at 980 nm. To overcome those drawbacks, different compound tellurite based glasses have been investigated [6\u20139] , including a tellurite\u2013tungsten (TW) based glass. Tungsten\u2013tellurite glass has the advantages of higher phonon energy, higher softening point, and a significantly broadened emission at 1.5 \u03bcm [9,10] . In this paper, we report the effect of Er 3+ concentration on optical properties of Er 3+ doped tungsten\u2013tellurite glass. Nonradiative processes for 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 and 4 I 13/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 transition of Er 3+ , J\u2013O intensity parameters and 1.5 \u03bcm emission bandwidth are mainly studied. The quenching rate of 4 I 13/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 transition obtained in TW glass is about 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u221218 cm 3 s \u22121 , giving an upper-limit for doping concentration of Er 3+ ions in TW glass. 2 Experimental Two types of Er 3+ -doped glass, (1) (40 \u2212 0.4 x )TeO 2 \u2013(40 \u2212 0.4 x )WO 3 \u2013(20 \u2212 0.2 x )Li 2 O\u2013 x Er 2 O 3 ( x = 0.1\u201310) (TW glass) and (2) 70TeO 2 \u201320ZnO\u201310Na 2 O\u20130.5% Er 2 O 3 , (TZN glass) were prepared using the conventional melting and quenching method. Well-mixed powder in a crucible was melted at 750\u2013900 \u00b0C for 0.5 h, then was quenched into a preheated brass mold to form glass. The quenched sample is annealed around the glass transition temperature for 2 h. The obtained glass samples were cut and polished into 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2.0 mm 3 size. Emission spectra in the range of 900\u20131700 nm were measured using a TRIAX 550 spectrometer with spectral resolution of 1 nm under the excitation of 808 nm from a diode laser. Absorption spectra were measured using a UV-3101PC spectrometer. The lifetime of the 4 I 13/2 state for Er 3+ was measured with a 500 MHz Tektronix digital oscilloscope model TDS 3052 under excitation of 808 nm light pulses from an Optical Parametric Oscillator (Sunlite 8000). All the measurements were taken at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Infrared emission spectra of Er 3+ Fig. 1 shows the 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 and 4 I 13/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 emission spectra of Er 3+ in (40 \u2212 0.4)TeO 2 \u2013(40 \u2212 0.4 x )WO 3 \u2013(20 \u2212 0.2 x )Li 2 O\u2013 x Er 2 O 3 ( x = 0.1\u201310) glasses doped with Er 2 O 3 at different concentrations. It can be seen that the 4 I 13/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 emission at 1.5 \u03bcm becomes broader as Er 3+ concentration increases. The values of full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the emission peak ranges from 65 to 110 nm. This suggests that local environment becomes disordered with the increase of Er 3+ doping level, broadening the Er 3+ emission band at 1.5 \u03bcm. Furthermore, the integrated intensity ratio of the 1.5 \u03bcm band to the 0.98 \u03bcm band decreases as Er 3+ concentration increases, as shown in Fig. 1 . This ratio is governed by 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 nonradiative relaxation and lifetime of 4 I 13/2 state, which will be studied in detail in the following sections. 3.2 Judd\u2013Ofelt analysis on absorption spectra of the TW glass Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of the TW glasses. The absorption spectra consist of seven absorption bands peaked at 1527, 975, 796, 652, 541, 520 and 488 nm, corresponding to the Er 3+ transitions from the ground state 4 I 15/2 to the excited states 4 I 13/2 , 4 I 11/2 , 4 I 9/2 , 4 F 9/2 , 4 S 3/2 , 2 H 11/2 and 4 F 7/2 , respectively. Some optical properties are directly related to Judd\u2013Ofelt (J\u2013O) parameters, which can be obtained by analyzing absorption spectra using J\u2013O theory [11,12] . From the theory, the strength of electric dipole transition between two J states, S ed can be expressed, (1) S ed ( J ; J \u2032 ) = \u2211 t = 2 , 4 , 6 \u03a9 t \u3008 \u03b1 SL , J \u2016 U ( t ) \u2016 \u03b1 \u2032 S \u2032 L \u2032 , J \u2032 \u3009 2 where \u03a9 t ( t = 2, 4, and 6) is the Judd\u2013Ofelt parameter, \u03b1SL define the other quantum numbers of the states, and the (\u2225 U ( t ) \u2225) is doubly reduced matrix element of unit tensor operator calculated in the intermediate coupling approximation. The \u03a9 t parameters can be obtained from a least-squares fit of Eq. (1) to the line strength of the absorption bands mentioned above. Absorption data and fitting results are listed in Table 1 . Parameter \u03a9 2 monotonically decreases with the increase of Er 3+ concentration, as shown in Table 1 , while \u03a9 4 , and \u03a9 6 have no significant change when the concentration increases. In general, local structure around the doped ions in the host has a strong effect on J\u2013O parameters. Parameter \u03a9 2 is affected by the covalent bonding and parameters \u03a9 4 and \u03a9 6 are related to the rigidity of the medium where the ions are situated. Thus the experimental results suggest that the covalent bond the Er\u2013O becomes weaker as Er 3+ concentration increases in TW glass. 3.3 Lifetime and concentration quenching of 4 I 13/2 level Fig. 3 represents the lifetimes (circles) and nonradiative transition rates (squares) of 4 I 13/2 level of Er 3+ in TW glass with different Er 3+ concentrations. The lifetime of 4 I 13/2 level decreases with the increase of Er 3+ concentration, which can be attributed to the nonradiative relaxation. The rate of nonradiative transition linearly increases with the increase of Er 3+ concentration, as shown in Fig. 3 . The nonradiative relaxation rate ( W 10 ) of 4 I 13/2 level is obtained using the following equation, (2) W 10 = \u03c4 1 - 1 - A 10 where \u03c4 1 and A 10 are lifetime (measured) and radiative transition rate (calculated) of 4 I 13/2 level, respectively. The nonradiative relaxation rate consists of a multi-phonon relaxation rate ( W MP ) and an energy transfer rate ( W ET ) which is Er 3+ concentration dependent. Energy transfer rate and Er 3+ concentration can be described by a linear relationship, W ET = kC , where k and C are energy transfer coefficient and Er 3+ concentration, respectively. The value of k is determined to be 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u221218 cm 3 s \u22121 in this work by fitting the experimental data (squares) with a linear function: W 1 = kC + W MP , (curve 1). The curve 2 is given by 1/( kC + W MP + A 10 ). Both calculated solid curves, as shown in Fig. 3 , fit the measured data very well. 3.4 The 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 nonradiative relaxation rates in TW glass and TZN glass Fig. 4 depicts a energy level diagram of Er 3+ at low energy levels. When pumped by 808 nm diode laser, Er 3+ is excited from ground state to 4 I 9/2 level, which rapidly relaxes to 4 I 11/2 state through nonradiative decay. Subsequently, the 4 I 13/2 level is populated through 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 nonradiative relaxation process. The rate of 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 relaxation is very important for creating population inversion of 4 I 13/2 level for optical amplification at 1.5 \u03bcm. In the steady excitation, one has (3) A 21 n 2 + W 21 n 2 = n 1 / \u03c4 1 where A 21 is 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 radiative transition rate, W 21 is 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 nonradiative relaxation rate, n 2 and n 1 is the population of 4 I 11/2 and 4 I 13/2 level respectively. If the intensity ratio of the 1.5 \u03bcm emission to the 0.98 \u03bcm emission is denoted by \u03b1 , then (4) \u03b1 = A 10 n 1 / A 20 n 2 From Eqs. (3) and (4) , we have (5) W 21 = \u03b1 A 21 / A 10 \u03c4 - A 21 where A 21 can be neglected because of W 21 \u226b A 21 , as reported in Ref. [6] . The 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 nonradiative relaxation rates W 21 are then calculated using the data listed in Table 1 , and the measured lifetime from Fig. 3 , and Eq. (5) . The rates are normalized to the one for the lowest Er 3+ concentration in the TW glasses and are plotted in Fig. 5 . As indicated in Fig. 5 , W 21 increases slightly with the increase of Er 3+ concentration. This is due to the domination of multiphonon decay in the 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 nonradiative relaxation; the contribution from the energy transfer, which is concentration dependent, is neglectable, even in the case of high concentration of Er 3+ doped TW glass. W 21 for a TZN glass is also plotted in Fig. 5 . It is observed that W 21 for Er 3+ doped TW glass is about twice as high as W 21 for Er 3+ doped TZN glass. Hence, population feeding of 4 I 13/2 of Er 3+ in TW glass is more effective than that in TZN glass under 0.98 \u03bcm pumping into the 4 I 11/2 level of Er 3+ ions. 4 Conclusions The 1.5 \u03bcm emission band becomes broader with increasing concentration of Er 3+ ions in tungsten\u2013tellurite glasses. The values of FWHM at 1.5 \u03bcm emission range from 65 to 110 nm. J\u2013O analysis indicates that the covalency of the Er\u2013O bond becomes weaker with the increase of Er 3+ concentration in TW glasses. The lifetime of the 4 I 13/2 state decreases with the increase of the Er 3+ concentration due to energy transfer process. The energy transfer coefficient among 4 I 13/2 states of different Er 3+ ions in TW glass was determined to be 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u221218 cm 3 s \u22121 . The nonradiative relaxation rate of 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 transition of Er 3+ in TW glass remains unchanged with the increase of Er 3+ concentration, and is about twice as high as that in TeO 2 \u2013ZnO\u2013Na 2 O glass. Hence, population feeding of 4 I 13/2 of Er 3+ in TW glass is more effective than that in TZN glass under 980 nm pumping into the 4 I 11/2 level of Er 3+ ions.

These compounds can gelate a variety of organic solvents in view of multiple intermolecular interactions, and compounds 2 with two TTF subunits exhibit higher gelation ability than their corresponding 1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation of the xerogels from toluene gave a visual image showing that fibrillar aggregates are entangled in three-dimensional network structures. The columnar TTF cores stacking in the fiber, evidenced by the mixed-valence states absorption at around 2000 nm in ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectra, provide an efficient pathway for the electron conduction. Upon oxidized by iodine, these xerogels exhibit semiconductive behaviors with moderate levels of conductivity. Additionally, the electrical conductivity of doped-xerogels 2 is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of 1 under identical conditions.",

        "abstract": "Upon 4K11/2 excitation of Sm3+ at 405 nm, the performance of energy transfer from Sm3+ to Eu3+ in the red emitting phosphor CaMoO4:Eu3+, Sm3+ significantly extends its excitation region for better matching the near-UV LED. Photoluminescence spectra indicate that the energy transfer pathway concerns the relaxation from 4K11/2 to 4G5/2 of Sm3+ and subsequent transfer to 5D0 of Eu3+ rather than 5D1 of Eu3+. The fluorescent decay pattern of Sm3+ 4G5/2 level in CaMoO4:0.5% Sm3+, 2% Eu3+ is studied at 77 K based on the Inokuti-Hirayama formula, revealing an electronic dipole-dipole interaction between Sm3+ and Eu3+. The coefficient for the energy transfer is obtained to be 8.5 \u00d7 10-40 s-1 cm6. The fluorescence rise and decay pattern of Eu3+ 5D0 level as Sm3+ is only excited at 77 K is well described by the dynamical processes of the energy transfer. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "In this pape,r the influence of surface effects on the self-activated (SA) luminescence in ZnS nanoparticles prepared by the wet-chemical method is presented. It is observed that the luminescence of SA decreases dramatically by rinsing with methanol. In the rinsed sample, the luminescence of SA increases more by ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. To clarify its origin, the Raman spectra and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) are studied. The results demonstrate that the vibrational modes assigned to organic functional groups of -OH and -COO and -CH3 decreases remarkably by rinsing, while the EPR signal originated from the unpaired electrons of some transition metal impurity ions including Mn2+ increases. It is suggested that the SA centers prefer to occupy the sites near the surface and that the donor of SA emission may be partly related to the organic functional groups of -OH and -COO adsorbed on the surface. The surface-dangling bonds caused by unpaired electrons of some transition metal impurity ions play a role of surface states, leading to the quenching of the SA emissions. The organic functional groups chemically combine with these surface-dangling bonds leading to the decrease in surface states and surface nonradiative relaxation channels and to the increase in the SA emissions. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of Lu content on crystal phase formation, luminescence properties and temperature characteristics are studied. It is revealed that the Lu induced luminescent enhancement can be attributed to the increase of absorbance of Ce3+ rather than the internal quantum efficiency. Intense and broadband emission is realized by controlling the Lu content to obtain a pure CLSMS crystal phase. The maximum luminescence intensity is obtained at x=0.54, which is as high as 156% of the Lu free phosphor. Combining the present phosphor with a blue LED chip, a white LED with an excellent color rendering index of 86 and high luminous efficiency of 86 lm\u00b7W-1 is obtained.",

The optimal fabrication temperatures for photoluminescence and persistent phosphorescence are found at 1200-1300 \u00b0C for photoluminescence and 1400 \u00b0C for persistent phosphorescence. The energy storage traps for persistent phosphorescence in the system are analyzed based on the dependence of photoluminescence and persistent phosphorescence on sintering temperature. The distribution of energy storage traps is further characterized by thermoluminescence spectra and the parameters of the traps are calculated.

        "abstract": "ZnS nanoparticles with different sizes are synthesized using a reverse micelles method in the presence of Tb 3+ ions. The photoluminescence, excitation and absorption spectra of ZnS/Tb 3+ NPs are studied to elucidate remarkable energy transfer from both ZnS host and the surfactant, i.e., AOT, to Tb 3+ ions. When Tb 3+ ions are introduced merely on the outside of ZnS nanoparticles in reverse micelles, obvious energy transfer from ZnS to the Tb 3+ ions is also observed, indicating the important role of spatial confinement on the performance of energy transfer between host and luminescent centers which are even not doped into the host lattices.",

        "abstract": "Eu3+ and Sm3+ co-doped CaMoO4 microclews have been successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method directly in surfactant-free environment. The as-prepared phosphor present clew-like agglomerates composed of 40 nm nanosheets under the moderated reaction temperature. The red phosphor CaMoO4:Eu3+, Sm3+ can generate a strong absorption line at 405 nm, originating from 6H5/2 \u2192 6P5/2 transition of Sm3+, which is suitable for the emission of the near-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (\u223c400 nm). Energy transfer between Sm3+ and Eu3+ is detected from the varied photoluminescence spectra with different Eu3+ concentrations and the energy transfer mechanism is clarified via the photoluminescence spectra. When Sm3+ is excited (405 nm), the electron is excited from 6H5/2 to 6P5/2, and then relaxed to 4G5/2. It jumps from 4G5/2 to the lower levels corresponding to the emissions of Sm3+; meanwhile, the transfers from 4G 5/2 state of Sm3+ ion to 5D0 state of Eu3+ ion come out. The transition of 5D1 \u2192 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2) does not appear indicating that the transfer from 4G5/2 state of Sm3+ to 5D0 state rather than 5D1 state of Eu3+ is the energy transfer pathway. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of flux and Eu concentration on the crystal structure, morphology and luminescent properties of the phosphors were investigated. The results showed that non-agglomeration phosphors with regular morphology and fine size were produced after the mixture being calcined at 800 degrees C for 4h with 3% NH4F as flux. The main emission peak of the samples is at 613 nm. The excitation spectrum showed that this phosphor can be effectively excited by ultraviolet (UV) (395 nm) and blue (465 nm) light, nicely fitting in with the widely applied output wavelengths of ultraviolet or blue LED chips.

Energy transfer from Eu2+ to Tb3+ and Eu2+ to Mn 2+ in BaMg2Al6Si9O30 host matrix is studied by luminescence spectra and energy-transfer efficiency and lifetimes. The wavelength-tunable white light can be realized by coupling the emission bands centered at 450, 542, and 610 nm ascribed to the contribution from Eu2+ and Tb3+ and Mn2+, respectively. By properly tuning the relative composition of Tb3+/Mn2+, chromaticity coordinates of (0.31, 0.30), high color rendering index R a = 90, and correlated color temperature (CCT) = 5374 K can be achieved upon excitation of UV light. Thermal quenching properties reveal that BaMg2Al6Si9O30: Eu2+, Tb3+, Mn2+ exhibits excellent characteristics even better than that of YAG:Ce.

Excellent thermal stability of the glass has been demonstrated using differential thermal analysis. Effects of the B 2 O 3 content on the infrared spectral properties such as the 1.5 \u03bcm emission bandwidth and the Judd\u2013Ofelt parameter \u03a9 t ( t = 2, 4, 6) of Er 3+ ions in the glass has been observed. The glass exhibits a large integrated emission cross sections for the 1.5 \u03bcm emission band. The Er 3+ -doped gadolinium borosilicate glass is a great candidate for broadband erbium doped fiber amplifiers. PACS 42.70.C 78.20.C 81.05.Pj 1 Introduction In recent years, Er 3+ -doped glasses with a broad 1.5 \u03bcm emission band have been extensively investigated in searching erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) with a wide and flat gain spectrum that is required for dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) optical network systems in the telecommunication [1\u20137] . Among the reported Er 3+ -doped glasses, Er 3+ -doped tellurite glasses have shown wide 1.5 \u03bcm emission bandwidths and a large stimulated emission section. Mori reported excellent performance of a tellurite based EDFA, which gave 80 nm-wide gain around 1.5\u20131.6 \u03bcm [5] . However, tellurite glasses have relatively poor thermal stability in comparison with silicate glasses. Tanabe et al. reported on bismuth-based glasses 43Bi 2 O 3 \u2013 x B 2 O 3 \u2013(57 \u2212 x )SiO 2 with a bandwidth about 75 nm [7] , but the description on thermal stability was unknown. In addition, thermal stability of Bi 2 O 3 \u2013B 2 O 3 \u2013Na 2 O glass reported by Yang [8] , in which the glass transition temperature ( T g ) and the temperature difference (\u0394 T ) only in excess of 415 and 123 \u00b0C, respectively. In this article, we report the preparation and the formation range of glass and the thermal stability of Er 3+ -doped gadolinium borosilicate glasses, Gd 2 O 3 \u2013B 2 O 3 \u2013SiO 2 \u2013Na 2 O\u2013Er 2 O 3 (GBSN:Er). A wide formation range of glass is experimentally obtained. Special attention was paid on 10Gd 2 O 3 \u2013(80 \u2212 x )B 2 O 3 \u2013 x SiO 2 \u201310Na 2 O\u20130.5Er 2 O 3 (G 10 BSN:Er and x = 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mol%), which shows high thermal stability. Spectral properties of the glass are also characterized. To our knowledge, there have been no research reports published yet concerning this glass system. 2 Experimental GBSN:Er glasses, in which the content of compositional Na 2 O is always 10 mol%, were prepared from anhydrous powders of Gd 2 O 3 , B 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , Na 2 O, and Er 2 O 3 with more than 99.9% purity. After melting the powders in a platinum crucible at 1400\u20131450 \u00b0C for 1.5 h, they are poured into pre-heated brass molds. After the formation range of glass was confirmed, the G 10 BSN:Er glasses were prepared. The quenched samples are annealed around 500 \u00b0C for 12 h and then cooled inside the furnace down to room temperature. The obtained G 10 BSN:Er glasses have been named GS 0 , GS 10 , GS 20 , GS 30 , and GS 40 glasses, corresponding to the SiO 2 content ( x ) of 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mol%, respectively. Emission spectra were recorded using a TRIAX 550 spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 1 nm under excitation of 980 nm laser diode. Absorption spectra were obtained using a Perkin\u2013Elmer 9 Lambda spectrometer. The differential thermal analysis (DTA) data was collected using a Perkin\u2013Elmer 7 Series Thermal Analysis System. 3 Results Fig. 1 shows the formation range of the GBSN:Er glass system. The symbols \u2018\u25cf\u2019, \u2018\u25cb\u2019, and \u2018\u25b5\u2019 denote glass, non-glass and half glass state, respectively. The directions of arrowhead show the increase of the host content. The glass phase can be formed only when the content of SiO 2 is 0\u201350 mol%, Gd 2 O 3 is 0\u201330 mol% and B 2 O 3 is above 20 mol% in this glass system. The glass can also be obtained but becomes translucent at the contents of 60 mol% SiO 2 and 30 mol% Gd 2 O 3 , or at the contents of 60 mol% SiO 2 and 30 mol% B 2 O 3 . There is no glass phase formed in other glass components. In addition, Na 2 O is added into the material for the diminution of the melting temperature of the glass. Fig. 2 shows the compositional dependence of glass transition temperature T g (\u25a0), crystallization onset temperature T x (\u25b4), and the temperature difference \u0394 T = T x \u2212 T g (\u25cf) in the G 10 BSN:Er glasses. It is found that both T g and T x increase as the SiO 2 content increases (up to x = 30) and the difference \u0394 T reaches a maximum of 193 \u00b0C at x = 20. The values of T g (>590 \u00b0C) and \u0394 T (133\u2013193 \u00b0C) in the G 10 BSN:Er glasses are both higher than the corresponding temperatures in bismuth borate glass ( T g > 415 \u00b0C; 170 \u00b0C > \u0394 T > 123 \u00b0C) [8] and tellurite glass ( T g > 290 \u00b0C; 130 \u00b0C > \u0394 T > 90 \u00b0C) [9] . The G 10 BSN:Er glass exhibits excellent thermal stability. The spectral properties of glasses including 1.5 \u03bcm bandwidth are directly related to Judd\u2013Ofelt (J\u2013O) parameters, which can be obtained by analyzing absorption spectra. Fig. 3 gives the absorption spectra of the G 10 BSN:Er glasses recorded at room temperature. The spectra consist of seven absorption bands peaking at 1527, 975, 796, 652, 541, 520 and 488 nm, corresponding to the transitions from the ground state 4 I 15/2 to the excited states 4 I 13/2 , 4 I 11/2 , 4 I 9/2 , 4 F 9/2 , 4 S 3/2 , 2 H 11/2 and 4 F 7/2 of Er 3+ ion, respectively. The radiative transition within the 4f n configuration of Er 3+ can be analyzed by use of the J\u2013O theory [10,11] . The electric dipole transition line strength S ed between two J states can be expressed as [12] (1) S ed ( J ; J \u2032 ) = \u2211 t = 2 , 4 , 6 \u03a9 t \u3008 \u03b1 SL , J \u2016 U ( t ) \u2016 \u03b1 \u2032 S \u2032 L \u2032 , J \u2032 \u3009 2 where \u03a9 t ( t = 2, 4, 6) is the Judd\u2013Ofelt parameter, \u03b1SL the other quantum numbers of the states, and the \u3008\u2225 U ( t ) \u2225\u3009 the doubly reduced matrix elements of unit tensor operators calculated in the intermediate coupling approximation. The \u03a9 t parameters can be obtained from a least-squares fit of Eq. (1) to the line strengths of above-mentioned seven absorption bands. J\u2013O parameters are the indicators of the local structure of the Er 3+ -doped host. The \u03a9 2 parameter is affected by the covalent chemical bonding and the \u03a9 4 and \u03a9 6 parameters are related to the rigidity of the medium where the Er 3+ ions are situated. Fig. 4 depicts the relationship between the \u03a9 t parameters of Er 3+ and the B 2 O 3 content in the G 10 BSN:Er glasses. It can be seen that \u03a9 2 decreases with the increase of B 2 O 3 content, while \u03a9 6 increases monotonically. There is a weaker degree of covalency of Er\u2013O bond at the GS 0 glass, because the \u03a9 2 reaches minimum value at the GS 0 glass. In addition, comparing \u03a9 4 and \u03a9 6 , the rigidity and viscosity of the GS 30 glass matrix are larger than that of all other glasses, because both the \u03a9 4 and \u03a9 6 reach minimum value at the GS 30 glass. Fig. 5 illustrates the emission spectra of the 4 I 13/2 to 4 I 15/2 transition of Er 3+ ions in the G 10 BSN:Er glasses, where the area under the emission spectral profile is normalized. Because of the differences of the emission spectra in different glass hosts, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is often used as a semiquantitative indication of the bandwidth. As shown in Fig. 5 , the FWHM of the emission increases from 60 to 70 nm as the content of B 2 O 3 increases from 0 to 40 mol%. The absorption cross section is obtained by using absorption spectra of the sample. According to the theory of McCumber [13] , the stimulated emission cross section \u03c3 e ( \u03bb ) can be calculated using the following expression: (2) \u03c3 e ( \u03bb ) = \u03c3 a ( \u03bb ) exp E - hc \u03bb kT where \u03c3 a ( \u03bb ) is the absorption cross section of the transition from the 4 I 15/2 state to the 4 I 13/2 state, E the temperature-dependent excitation energy, k the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature of the sample. The values of the excitation energy E , the absorption and the calculated emission cross sections of Er 3+ ions at the peak place are listed in Table 1 . Both the absorption and emission cross sections of Er 3+ reach a maximum of 0.45 \u00d7 10 \u221220 and 0.52 \u00d7 10 \u221220 cm 2 at the GS 30 glass, respectively, as shown in Table 1 . 4 Discussion According to Eq. (1) , the S ed of the Er 3+ ions is expressed as (3) S ed [ 4 I 13 / 2 ; 4 I 15 / 2 ] = 0.019 \u00d7 \u03a9 2 + 0.118 \u00d7 \u03a9 4 + 1.462 \u00d7 \u03a9 6 Evidently, the \u03a9 6 plays a dominant role in broadening the bandwidth of the 1.5 \u03bcm emission among the three \u03a9 t s. Thus increasing the \u03a9 6 parameter will result in the increase of the 1.5 \u03bcm emission bandwidth. Hence, both of the \u03a9 6 and the 1.5 \u03bcm emission bandwidth increase with the increase of B 2 O 3 content in the G 10 BSN:Er glasses, as shown in Fig. 6 . The gain bandwidth of optical amplifier can be evaluated by integrated emission cross section, estimated by the product of FWHM \u00d7 \u03c3 e peak where \u03c3 e peak is the emission cross section at the peak of 1.5 \u03bcm band. The bigger the product is, the better the gain characteristic of EDFA yields. Fig. 7 represents the FWHM \u00d7 \u03c3 e peak product of Er 3+ in different glass hosts. It can be seen that the value of the FWHM \u00d7 \u03c3 e peak product in the prepared glasses are more than those of germanate [14] , silicate [15] and phosphate [16] glasses. Furthermore, the maximum value of the product among these glasses reported in this work is smaller than that of oxyfluoride silicate glass [17] , which have a bigger integrated emission cross section in the previous reported glasses. 5 Conclusions A new glass of GBSN:Er glasses system is prepared, and formation range of the glass is experimentally obtained. On the analysis of DTA data, the Er 3+ -doped G 10 BSN:Er glasses exhibit high thermal stability with glass transition temperatures higher than 590 \u00b0C. The glasses exhibit broad 1.5 \u03bcm emission band around 70 nm, which are much larger than that of silica glasses with a narrow emission bandwidth around 30 nm presenting use. In addition, the glasses also have larger area of integrated emission cross sections than germanate, silicate and phosphate glasses. Therefore, the Er 3+ -doped glass GBSN:Er system is a promising host for the EDFA in the 1.5 \u03bcm window telecommunication system.

        "title": "Enhancement of the red emission in CaTiO3:Pr3+ by addition of rare earth oxides",
        "abstract": "Enhancement of the 1 D 2 \u2013 3 H 4 red emission of CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ with addition of rare earth oxides Ln 2 O 3 (Ln = Lu, La, Gd) is reported. Ca 2+ and Ti 4+ in CaTiO 3 can be substituted by Ln 3+ ions as donors and acceptors, respectively. Ca 2+ and Ti 4+ vacancies, as quenching centers in the host, are effectively suppressed by the self-compensation, leading to the increase of lifetimes and then the emission efficiency of 1 D 2 . The red fluorescence intensity for CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ phosphor co-doped with 5 mol% Lu 2 O 3 is nearly 3 times greater than that of the Lu-free samples. Great attention has been paid recently on the development of advanced displays for the multimedia applications, which can replace some cathode-ray tubes (CRTs). Field emission display (FED) is one of the candidates for advanced flat-panel applications [1,2] . Therefore, the development of phosphors suitable for FED is urgently needed. In 1994, CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ was first reported as a promising red FED phosphor [3] . Two years later, Sung et al. optimized the preparation conditions of CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ [4] and further stimulated the research on enhancing the red luminescence of the phosphor [5] . It was reported early that the red emission of SrTiO 3 :Pr 3+ with addition of Al 3+ was greatly intensified compared to the Al-free samples under low-energy electron or ultraviolet light excitation [6,7] . In SrTiO 3 :Pr 3+ , Al 3+ , Pr 3+ substituted for the Sr 2+ sites, and then the charge was balanced by the substitution of Al 3+ for Ti 4+ sites. The charge compensation reduced the point defects around Pr 3+ and increased the energy transfer from SrTiO 3 to Pr 3+ . Enhancement of emission by addition of other trivalent metal ions, such as B 3+ , Ga 3+ and In 3+ in SrTiO 3 :Pr 3+ phosphor [1] and Sc 3+ , Yb 3+ in BaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ phosphor [8] , was also observed. The red emissions of Pr-doped CaTiO 3 phosphor were stronger than that of Pr-doped SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 and even better than their enhanced emissions [6,9] . However, the emission efficiency of CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ was low for any practical applications [5] , requiring further enhancement of its red emission. Some improvements were obtained by adding metal ions such as Na + , Tl + and Ag + for charge compensation. The emission intensities were enhanced up to factors of 1.3 and 1.6 by adding Na + or Tl + and Ag + to the CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ system, respectively [5] . In this Letter, the enhancement of photoluminescence (PL) intensity is reported in CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ phosphor with addition of rare earth oxides, Ln 2 O 3 (Ln = Lu, La, Gd). It is observed that the PL intensity is nearly triple for 5 mol% Lu 2 O 3 added samples compared to the Lu-free samples. The emission efficiency of CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ is improved by reducing the amount of defect centers. The dynamical processes of the emission are studied and the mechanisms of the fluorescence enhancement investigated. For sample preparation, the powder mixture of CaCO 3 , TiO 2 , rare earth oxides Ln 2 O 3 (Ln = Lu, La, Gd), and PrCl 3 solution were resolved into the de-ionized water, and then heated at 100 \u00b0C for 3\u20135 h to obtain the dried powders. The powders were grounded in fume cupboard for 1 h until the pellets formed. The pellets were then sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 3 h under air. The doped concentration of Pr 3+ was fixed at 0.1 mol%. The structure of the final products was characterized by powder X-ray diffractometer using a Cu target radiation source. PL, PL excitation (PLE), and diffused reflectance spectra were measured using Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The third harmonic of a pulsed Nd\u2013YAG laser (355 nm) together with Tektronix digital oscilloscope (model TDS 3052) was used for lifetime measurement. Fig. 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ with and without the addition of 2.5 mol% Ln 2 O 3 (Ln = Lu, La, Gd). The phase of CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ is orthorhombic (JCPDS No. 82-0228). There are no extra peaks observed in the XRD patterns from the Ln 2 O 3 added samples, suggesting that Ln 3+ incorporates into CaTiO 3 lattice. The inset of Fig. 1 shows the shifts of the main XRD peak to the lower-angle side in the Ln-added samples compared to the Ln-free sample, which can be attributed to the lattice expansion because the ionic radii of Ln 3+ are larger than that of Ti 4+ in the six-coordinated state [1] . There is no significant shift of XRD peaks observed as Ca 2+ is replaced by Ln 3+ , since the ionic radii of Ln 3+ are close to that of Ca 2+ in the twelve-coordinated state [1] . Therefore, the shifts provide the evidence of Ln 3+ substitution for the Ti 4+ instead of Ca 2+ . Table 1 lists the related ion radii in the twelve and six-coordinated state [10] . To further explore the site-occupancy of Ln 3+ ions in CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ , the non-stoichiometrical CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ samples with or without Lu 2 O 3 addition are examined Fig. 2 shows the diffused reflectance spectra of the samples with different Ca/Ti ratios. The valence-to-conduction absorption bands with edge around 330 nm are clearly presented in all the samples. In comparison with the stoichiometrical samples ( Fig. 2 b), there appears an extra shoulder around 380 nm in Lu free sample with Ca/Ti = 0.9 (dashed line in Fig. 2 a). This shoulder can be reasonably attributed to the absorption of some defects related to Ca 2+ vacancies, which are easily generated in the sample by the deficiency of Ca. It is found that the shoulder disappears as Lu 2 O 3 is added (solid line in Fig. 2 a), indicating the elimination of Ca 2+ vacancies. As a result, Ca 2+ vacancies are considered to be occupied effectively by Lu 3+ ions acting as donors [11] . Fig. 2 c depicts that the Lu-free sample with Ti/Ca = 0.9 exhibits lower reflectance than the sample with Ca/Ti = 0.9 or Ca/Ti = 1.0. From the figure, it is speculated that Ti 4+ vacancies have absorption in the whole visible range. When Lu 2 O 3 is added, the reflectance increases slightly in the spectral range, indicating that Ti 4+ vacancies are more difficult for Lu 3+ occupation than Ca 2+ vacancies. Moreover, the change of body color for these phosphors is in agreement with the enhancement of reflectance when Lu 2 O 3 is added. The body colors for Ca/Ti = 0.9 and Ca/Ti = 1.0 samples without Lu 2 O 3 addition are brown and become whitish when Lu 2 O 3 is added; while the brown body color of the sample with Ti/Ca = 0.9 has no change when adding Lu 2 O 3 into the host. The similar changes of body color for La or Gd-doped CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ have also been observed. Fig. 3 presents PL ( \u03bb ex = 330 nm) and PLE ( \u03bb em = 615 nm) spectra of CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ with different concentrations of Lu 2 O 3 . The PLE spectra mainly consist of two broad bands centered at 330 nm and 370 nm, respectively. The former corresponds to the absorption of Pr 3+ 4f5d states [12] and the latter is attributed to a low-lying Pr-to-metal (Pr 3+ \u2013Ti 4+ ) intervalence charge transfer state (IVCT) [13] . A group of weaker peaks are detected at 458 nm, 480 nm and 495 nm, corresponding to the 3 H 4 \u2192 3 P 2 , 3 P 1 , and 3 P 0 transitions of Pr 3+ , respectively [12] . The PL spectra show the intensity-calibrated red emissions peaking at 615 nm due to the 1 D 2 \u2013 3 H 4 transition of Pr 3+ . It is clearly exhibited that the red emissions are enhanced by the addition of Lu 2 O 3 . The maximum enhancement occurs in 5 mol% Lu 2 O 3 added sample, where the emission intensity is nearly 3 times greater than that of the Lu-free sample. In order to understand the mechanism of the fluorescence enhancement, the lifetimes of the 1 D 2 level of Pr 3+ are measured for the samples with different Lu 2 O 3 concentrations and are plotted in Fig. 4 . For comparison, the dependence of the red fluorescence intensity on Lu 2 O 3 concentration is also presented, showing that the lifetimes and the fluorescence intensities increase in the same scale as Lu 2 O 3 concentration increases. This indicates that the fluorescence enhancement is due to the increase of 1 D 2 \u2013 3 H 4 emission efficiency. As a result, it is believed that there originally exist some defects as nonradiative recombination centers for 1 D 2 level of Pr 3+ . The number of centers may be reduced by the addition of Lu 2 O 3 , leading to the increase of red fluorescence lifetimes and intensities. In CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ , Pr 3+ substitutes for Ca 2+ , creating point defects, such as Ca 2+ vacancies or Ti 4+ , to compensate extra positive charge of Pr 3+ . In addition, the Ca 2+ or Ti 4+ vacancies can be formed during the sintering process. As shown in Fig. 2 , Lu 3+ can substitute either Ca 2+ as donors or Ti 4+ as acceptors [14] in CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ , Lu 3+ . This self-compensation has been observed in Sm 2 O 3 , Y 2 O 3 , and Ho 2 O 3 doped BaTiO 3 ceramics [11,14\u201317] . The addition of Ln 3+ in CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ reduces the point defects, such as Ca 2+ and Ti 4+ vacancies, which act as nonradiative quenching centers for the 1 D 2 transition, thus enhancing the red emission efficiency. Obviously, the mechanism of fluorescence enhancement for co-doped Lu 3+ in CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ differs from that for co-doped Al 3+ in SrTiO 3 :Pr 3+ , in which the increase of energy transfer efficiency between host and Pr 3+ is considered [7] . In Fig. 4 , the lifetimes and fluorescence intensities become saturated as the Lu 2 O 3 concentration beyond 5%, suggesting the limited solubility of Lu 2 O 3 in CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ . The fluorescence enhancement by the addition of La 2 O 3 and Gd 2 O 3 is also observed, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4 . In conclusion, the enhancement of red emission in CaTiO 3 :Pr 3+ phosphor has been obtained with addition of rare earth oxides Ln 2 O 3 (Ln = Lu, La, Gd). Ln 3+ incorporates into CaTiO 3 lattice by substituting either Ca 2+ as donors or Ti 4+ as acceptors. The substitution reduces the point defects related to Ca 2+ and Ti 4+ vacancies and thus enhances the red emission due to the increase of 1 D 2 \u2013 3 H 4 transition efficiency.

Both the crystallinity of samples and the concentration of OH- adsorbed at the surface were experimentally controlled by adjusting the reaction time. An abnormal phenomenon that photoluminescence efficiency decreases with the increase of crystallinity demonstrates enormously adverse effect of OH- on photoluminescence, especially, as the OH- content reaches a critical value, the luminescent efficiency decreases more drastically. This strong dependence of photoluminescence on the OH- content indicates that to control the OH- content in a limited range or to reduce the OH- effect as much as possible is an efficient way to improve photoluminescence efficiency. \u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "There has been considerable interest recently in materials which show prolonged persistent phosphorescence following short periods of excitation; the persistence has been reported in a large variety of phosphor materials including sulfides, oxides, and complex silicates and aluminates. The phosphorescence has generally been attributed to the presence of traps in most instances produced by a co-dopant ion. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the persistent phosphorescence as a function of phosphor particle size and find that the persistence time increases as a function of decreasing particle size. The increase in time is attributable to an increase in surface trapping levels commensurate with changes in the surface to volume ratio in the phosphor particles. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Eu 2+ and Eu 2+-Mn 2+ codoped (Ba,Sr)Mg 2Al 6Si 9O 30 phosphors have been synthesized by solid state reaction, and their luminescent properties are investigated. Under the excitation of 330 nm, it is observed that the emission of Eu 2+ consists of two emission bands, located at around 370 and 450 nm, which are attributed to two Eu 2+ centers (Eu 2+(I) and Eu 2+(II)) ions substituting for two different Ba 2+ and Mg 2+ sites, respectively. As Sr 2+ gradually substitutes Ba 2+, the emission bands of Eu 2+(I) shift to longer wavelength whereas the emission bands of Eu 2+(II) exhibit no change. This phenomenon is discussed in terms of the crystal-field strength. A detail analysis on the energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ in SrMg 2Al 6Si 9O 30 host is presented, which indicates the energy of the red emission of Mn 2+ is derived mainly from Eu 2+(I). We have also demonstrated that BaMg 2Al 6Si 9O 30:Eu 2+, Mn 2+ exhibits better thermal quenching properties than that of SrMg 2Al 6Si 9O 30:Eu 2+, Mn 2+ because of bigger activation energy. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Upon VUV excitation of the 4f5d states of Pr(3+), quantum cutting could occur by a two-step energy transfer from Pr(3+) to Cr(3+) by cross relaxation and sequential transfer of the remaining excitation energy. A theoretical visible quantum efficiency of 147% is estimated in SrAl(12)O(19):2% Pr,5% Cr, suggesting the possibility of a VUV phosphor with visible quantum efficiency higher than 100% based on Pr(3+)-Cr(3+) pair in oxide materials.",

The result indicates an electric dipole\u2013dipole interaction that governs ET in the LED phosphors.

An increase in the red emission line of Pr 3+ relative to the yellow emission band of Ce 3+ , on increasing Ce 3+ concentration is observed. This behavior is attributed to the increase of spectral overlap integrals between Ce 3+ emission and Pr 3+ excitation due to the fact that the yellow band shifts to the red spectral side with increasing Ce 3+ concentration.

Keywords YAG:Ce 3+ ,Pr 3+ LED phosphors Energy transfer 1 Introduction White light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have attracted much interest in recent years for their significant potentials in solid-state lighting of next generation. At present the main strategy for producing white LEDs is to combine blue and/or near UV (NUV) LED with phosphors. The combination of blue LED with the yellow emitting Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce 3+ (YAG:Ce 3+ ) phosphor is a general way to produce white light. YAG:Ce 3+ can effectively absorb blue light and subsequently emit yellow light, originating from the transition from the lowest 5d state to 2 F 5/2 and 2 F 7/2 ground states of Ce 3+ [1,2] . However, YAG:Ce 3+ has relatively weak emission in the red spectral region, leading to low color rendering of white LEDs. To enhance the red component, Mueller-Mach et al. [3] added Pr 3+ to YAG:Ce 3+ and consequently observed a sharp red line at about 608 nm, originating from 1 D 2 \u2192 3 H 4 transition of Pr 3+ , meaning the performance of energy transfer (ET) from Ce 3+ to Pr 3+ in YAG. Subsequently, YAG:Ce 3+ , Pr 3+ attracted many investigations [4\u20137] . The combination of a NUV LED with RGB phosphors is another alternative to produce white light, which may provide a high color rendering and stable color point against forward current. Among the RGB phosphors, red-emitting phosphors are scarce at present. Eu 3+ doped CaMoO 4 has been investigated as a potential red-emitting phosphor because it exhibits more stable physical and chemical properties than the well-known red phosphor Y 2 O 2 S:Eu 3+ . The red emission is originated from 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 transition of Eu 3+ and the NUV excitation performs at around 395 nm through 7 F 0 \u2192 5 L 6 absorption of Eu 3+ . Some investigations on enhancing the luminescence intensity of CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ were reported by introducing Li + , Na + , K + and Bi 3+ ions into the phosphor [8\u201310] . In our previous work [11] , we added Sm 3+ to CaMoO 4 :Eu 3+ to generate additional NUV excitation line at 405 nm, originating from 6 H 5/2 \u2192 4 K 11/2 absorption of Sm 3+ based on the performance of ET from Sm 3+ to Eu 3+ . The significance of the transfer is to extend the excitation lines in the spectral range 390\u2013410 nm so as to take advantage of all spectral components of the NUV LED excitation source. Energy transfer from Sm 3+ to Eu 3+ was also observed in other red-emitting phosphors Na 0.5 Sm 0.1 Eu 0.4 WO 4 [12] , NaEu(MoO 4 ) 2 [13] and other molybdate [14] . In this paper, we demonstrate energy transfer dynamical processes in YAG:Ce 3+ , Pr 3+ and CaMoO 4 :Sm 3+ , Eu 3+ based on experimental measurements of photoluminescence (PL) and fluorescence decay curves. 2 Experimental The powder samples have been prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. For the preparation of YAG:Ce 3+ , Pr 3+ phosphor, Y 2 O 3 , CeO 2 , Al 2 O 3 and Pr 6 O 11 are mixed in 1 M (Y 1\u2212 x \u2212 y Ce x Pr y ) 3 Al 5 O 12 ( x , y represent the concentration of Ce 3+ and Pr 3+ , respectively) and 3 wt% BaF 2 was added as the flux. After a good mixing in an agate mortar, the mixture was sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 3 h under a reducing atmosphere. CaMoO 4 :Sm 3+ /Eu 3+ phosphors were obtained by solid-state reaction in air as reported previously [10] . The structure of final products is characterized by power X-ray diffraction (XRD). PL spectra are measured with a Hitachi Spextra-fluorometer (F-4500). The decay of fluorescence with lifetime less than 1 \u03bcs is measured by an FL920 fluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments, Livingston, UK) with a hydrogen flash lamp (nF900; Edinburgh Instruments). In the measurements of fluorescent decay with lifetime longer than 1 \u03bcs, an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) is used as an excitation source. The signal is detected by a Tektronix digital oscilloscope (TDS 3052). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Energy transfer in YAG:Ce 3+ , Pr 3+ Fig. 1 shows the decay curve of yellow fluorescence of Ce 3+ in sample series A (Y 0.99\u2212 x Ce 0.01 Pr x ) 3 Al 5 O 12 . The decay is measured by monitoring at 530 nm on 340 nm pulsed excitation. The decay changes from exponential to non-exponential patterns with increasing x , reflecting the effect of Ce 3+ \u2013Pr 3+ ET. The ET pathway is conformably considered to start from the lowest 5d state of Ce 3+ to the 1 D 2 state of Pr 3+ . Based on the Ce 3+ and Pr 3+ energy level diagrams, a radiative ET seems to be possible. However, we cannot observe the red line in a blend of YAG:Ce 3+ and YAG:Pr 3+ phosphors, indicating that ET takes place rather by non-radiative interaction, as suggested by Yang and Kim [6] . The normalized intensity of donor fluorescence can be written as (1) I D ( t ) = I D0 ( t ) f ( t ) where \u0399 D0 ( t ) is the decay function of donors in the absence of acceptors and the function f ( t ) characterizes loss of excited donors due to one way ET to the acceptors. If the ET rate between a donor and an acceptor is proportional to an inverse power of the distance r , written as \u03b1 / r m , according to the Inokuti\u2013Hirayama [15] formula, we have (2) f ( t ) = exp [ \u2212 4 3 \u03c0 \u0393 ( 1 \u2212 3 m ) n A \u03b1 3 / m t 3 / m ] where \u03b1 is a rate constant for ET; m =6, 8 and 10 are the coefficients for dipole\u2013dipole, dipole\u2013quadrupole, and quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interaction, respectively and n A is the number of acceptor ions per unit volume. From Eqs. (1 ) and ( 2 ), ln{ln[ I D0 ( t )/ I D ( t )]} acts as a linear function of ln( t ) with a slope of 3/ m , and ln[ I D ( t )/ I D0 ( t )] is proportional to t 3/ m with a slope of 4 \u03c0\u0413 (1\u22123/ m ) n A \u03b1 3/ m /3. Labeling the 5d state of Ce 3+ by 1, the log\u2013log plot of ln[ I 10 ( t )/ I 1 ( t )] vs. t for sample (Y 0.99\u2212 x Ce 0.01 Pr x ) 3 Al 5 O 12 with x =0.02 is presented in Fig. 2 . It is demonstrated that the slope for t >20 ns is 0.56, close to 1/2, indicating an electric dipole\u2013dipole interaction for ET. Regarding m as 6, we have plotted ln[ I 1 ( t )/ I 10 ( t )] vs. t 1/2 for the samples (Y 0.99\u2212 x Ce 0.01 Pr x ) 3 Al 5 O 12 with x =0.01 and 0.02, as shown in Fig. 3 . The best fitting to each of the two curves yields a transfer constant \u03b1 =4.5\u00d710 \u221236 cm 6 s \u22121 for Ce 3+ \u2013Pr 3+ ET in YAG with Ce 3+ concentration of 0.01. In the fitting n A, i.e. the number density of Pr 3+ , is given by xN Y with N Y =1.38\u00d710 22 cm \u22123 being the number of Y sites per unit volume in YAG. Using the value of \u03b1 the critical ET distance r 0 (the spatial separation between a donor and an acceptor, where the ET rate \u03b1 / r 0 6 = 1 / \u03c4 1 0 ) is calculated to be about 0.81 nm. In the calculation, the intrinsic lifetime \u03c4 10 is 61 ns determined in 0.0005 Ce 3+ lowly doped YAG, which exhibits a pure exponential decay. In Fig. 2 there is an increase in slope below 20 ns, forming a crossover [16] . As we know, Eq. (2) is obtained by assuming the nearest distance between a donor and a acceptor to be 0, leading to an infinite initial ET rate. Hence, Eq. (2) is not applicable at short times, which is less than 20 ns in the present sample. To improve the color rendering of white LED, it was observed [5,6] that further increasing Pr 3+ concentration for obtaining sufficient red componnets, however, leads to reduction of the red line due to Pr 3+ \u2013Pr 3+ self-quenching [17,18] . Fig. 4 shows the PL spectra of sample series B (Y 0.995\u2212 y Ce y Pr 0.005 ) 3 Al 5 O 12 with Pr 3+ concentration fixed at 0.005 and various Ce 3+ concentration y in the range 0\u20130.02, where intensity of the yellow emisson band of Ce 3+ is normalized. It can be seen that the intensity ratio of red to yellow emission ( R / Y ) monotonously grows up with increasing y , showing a way to improve the red component of the phosphor. In view of small changes of the red fluorescence lifetimes with increasing y , the enhanced red line is an indication of increased macroscopic Ce 3+ \u2013Pr 3+ ET rate. One can find the existence, in connection with the enhancement of the R / Y ratio, of a redshift of the yellow PL band with increasing Ce 3+ concentration, as has been observed in Ce 3+ singly doped YAG [19] . The redshift enhances the spectral distribution of the yellow band at the position of the red line. As a result, we suggest that the redshift is favourable for effectively increasing the spectral overlap integrals between the yellow emission band and the red absorption line, and therefore enhancing the ET rate. In the case of much narrower red line than the yellow band, their spectral overlap integral is proportional to the spectral intensity of the yellow band at the red line site, denoted by Y R . The R / Y ratio and Y R , approximately satisfy a proportional relationship, as shown in Fig. 5 . 3.2 Energy transfer in CaMoO 4 :Sm 3+ , Eu 3+ The PL spectra of Sm 3+ singly doped CaMoO 4 under excitation at 405 nm exhibit three characteristic transitions of Sm 3+ : 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 (561 nm), 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 7/2 (596 nm, 604 nm) and 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 9/2 (642 nm), as shown in Fig. 6 (a). The PL spectra of Eu 3+ singly doped CaMoO 4 under excitation at 395 nm consist of series of characteristic lines of Eu 3+ originating from the transitions of 5 D 1 \u2192 7 F 1 at 534 nm, 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 at 590 nm and 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 at 612 nm as shown in Fig. 6 (b). In Eu 3+ and Sm 3+ doubly doped CaMoO 4 , the PL spectra under 395 nm excitation (see Fig. 6 (c)) are the same as that of Eu 3+ singly doped samples, indicating that Sm 3+ cannot be excited by 395 nm and there is no energy transfer from Eu 3+ to Sm 3+ . When the doubly doped sample is excited at 270 nm, characteristic emissions of both Eu 3+ and Sm 3+ can be observed, as shown in Fig. 6 (d). As the doubly doped sample is excited into the 4 K 11/2 level of Sm 3+ at 405 nm, besides the fluorescence of Sm 3+ , the fluorescence from 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 and 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 transitions of Eu 3+ is also observed (see Fig. 6 (e)). This is the indication of energy transfer from Sm 3+ to Eu 3+ . A notable behavior presented in Fig. 6 (e) is that the 5 D 1 \u2192 7 F 1 emission of Eu 3+ disappears. As a result, the energy transfer pathway is from 4 G 5/2 of Sm 3+ to the 5 D 0 of Eu 3+ rather than 5 D 1 level, as illustrated in the energy level diagram in Fig. 7 . To know the mechanism of energy transfer from the 4 G 5/2 level of Sm 3+ to 5 D 0 level of Eu 3+ , decay of 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 9/2 fluorescence I 3 (t) of Sm 3+ is measured by monitoring at 642 nm while the 4 G 5/2 level is excited at 561 nm in CaMoO 4 : 0.5% Sm 3+ , 2% Eu 3+ . The ln\u2013ln plot of ln[ I 30 ( t )/ I 3 ( t )] vs. t shows a slope close to 3/6, indicating an electric dipole\u2013dipole energy transfer with m =6. Fig. 8 shows the plot of ln[ I 3 ( t )/ I 30 ( t )] vs. t 1/2 . The slope of linear pattern yields \u03b1 to be 8.5\u00d710 \u221240 cm 6 s \u22121 . The critical ET distance of 0.89 nm is evaluated. In the calculation, I 30 ( t ) has an exponential decay of the form exp(\u2212 t / \u03c4 30 ), where \u03c4 30 is 595 \u03bcs as obtained in CaMoO 4 : 0.5% Sm 3+ . 4 Conclusion Non-radiative energy transfers (ET) from Ce 3+ to Pr 3+ in Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce 3+ , Pr 3+ and from Sm 3+ to Eu 3+ in CaMoO 4 :Sm 3+ , Eu 3+ are both governed by an electric dipole\u2013dipole interaction. For Ce 3+ concentration of 0.01, the corresponding rate constant and critical distance are evaluated to be 4.5\u00d710 \u221236 cm 6 s \u22121 and 0.81 nm, respectively, for Ce 3+ \u2013Pr 3+ ET in YAG. An increase in red/yellow ratio on increasing Ce 3+ concentration is observed. This behavior is attributed to the increase of spectral overlap integrals between Ce 3+ emission and Pr 3+ excitation due to the fact that the yellow band shifts to the red side with increasing Ce 3+ concentration while the red line does not move. In CaMoO 4 :Sm 3+ , Eu 3+ phosphor, Sm 3+ \u2013Eu 3+ transfer occurs from 4 G 5/2 of Sm 3+ to 5 D 0 of Eu 3+ . The transfer rate constant of 8.5\u00d710 \u221240 cm 6 s \u22121 and the critical transfer distance of 0.89 nm are evaluated.

        "abstract": "A new type of anthracene organogelator based on uracil was obtained using organic aromatic solvents, cyclohexane, DMSO, ethanol, and ethyl acetate. It was further characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Specifically, the resulting organogels were demonstrated to be promising colorimetric and fluorescent sensors toward fluoride ions with high sensitivity and selectivity, accompanying the disruption of the gelators. Spectroscopic study and (1)H NMR titration experiment revealed that the deprotonation of the hydrogen atom on the N position of uracil moiety by fluoride ions is responsible for the recognition events, evidenced by immediate transformation from the sol phase to the gel state upon adding a small amount of a proton solvent, methanol. The process is reversible, with zero loss in sensing activity and sol-to-gel transformation ability even after five runs.",

        "abstract": "A series of Eu 2+ and Mn 2+ coactivated Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 phosphors have been synthesized by solid state reactions and their luminescence properties have been investigated by means of powder diffuse reflection, photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra, and lifetimes. The phosphor Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ exhibits two dominating bands situated at 460 and 550 nm, originate from the allowed 5d \u2192 4f transition of the Eu 2+ ion and the 4 T 1g (4G) \u2192 6 A 1g (6S) transition of the Mn 2+ ion, respectively. We have discovered that energy transfers from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ by directly observing significant overlap of the excitation spectrum of Mn 2+ and the emission spectrum of Eu 2+ as well as the decline of lifetimes of Eu 2+ . By utilizing the principle of energy transfer, we have demonstrated that with appropriate tuning of activator content Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ phosphors exhibit potential to act as a phosphor for near ultraviolet light-emitting diodes. Keywords Phosphors Energy transfers Light emitting diodes 1 Introduction White light-emitting diodes (white-LEDs) have attracted much attention in recent years, in which white light can be generated by a blue-emitting InGaN chip and yellow-emitting phosphor Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce 3+ garnet (YAG:Ce 3+ ) [1] . However, this method has the following problems: white emitting color changes with input power, low color-rendering index due to two color mixing and low reproducibility due to strong dependence of white color quality on an amount of phosphor. From this point of view, single-composition phosphors for ultraviolet (UV) or near ultraviolet (NUV) excitations have drawn many attentions for solid state lighting. As compared to the InGaN-based blue LED chip combined with YAG:Ce 3+ phosphor, a white-LED fabricated using a phosphor blend of single-composition emission tunable phosphor pumped with UV/NUV chips has advantages of high tolerance to UV chip color variation and excellent color-rendering index [2\u20136] . One of the strategies for generating single-phased emission-tunable phosphor is by co-doping sensitizer and activator into the same host, which is based on the mechanism of energy transfer from sensitizer to activator. The phosphors with energy transfer mechanism of sensitizer/activator, such as Eu 2+ /Mn 2+ , have been synthesized and investigated in many hosts [7\u201311] . Although there were sweeping studies on the above fields in the past years, Eu 2+ /Mn 2+ -coactivated calcium aluminate silicate chloride were rarely reported. In this work, We have demonstrated a single-composition emission-tunable Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 : Eu x 2 + , Mn y 2 + phosphor by energy transfer mechanism between the luminescence centers Eu 2+ and Mn 2+ , the color can be tuned from blue to yellow. We have also proven that a near-white light can be achieved by increasing the dopant contents of Mn 2+ . The Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ phosphor exhibits great potential for use in white NUV-LED applications. 2 Experimental Ca 3\u2212 x \u2212 y Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 : Eu x 2 + , Mn y 2 + (0.8 \u2a7d \u03b4 \u2a7d 1.5) phosphors were synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The starting materials, CaCO 3 , Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 and CaCl 2 of reagent grade, were mixed together. A small amount of high-purity Eu 2 O 3 and MnCO 3 was added into the mixture. The well-mixed reactants were placed in a crucible closed with a lid. The reactants were calcined at 1000 \u00b0C in 10% H 2 /90% N 2 for 4 h. The structure of sintered samples was identified by an X-ray powder diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX-2500 V), using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.54056 \u00c5). A step size of 0.02\u00b0(2 \u03b8 ) was used with a scanning speed of 4\u00b0/min. The measurements of photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra were performed by using a Hitachi F4500 spectrometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp under a working voltage of 700 V. The excitation and emission slits were both set at 2.5 nm. The diffuse reflectance measurements are performed using the same spectrometer with BaSO 4 powder as a reflectance standard. In fluorescence lifetime measurements, the third harmonic (355 nm) of an Nd-doped yttrium aluminum garnet pulsed laser (Spectra-Physics, GCR 130) was used as an excitation source, and the signals were detected with a Tektronix digital oscilloscope (TDS 3052). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the powder XRD pattern of Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 (0.8 \u2a7d \u03b4 \u2a7d 1.5) phosphor with different \u03b4 contents. It can be seen that the Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3 Cl 4 (JCPDS No. 50-1543) are hardly obtained in single-phase form with small amounts of secondary phase. Xia reported that the phosphors they synthesized with the given chemical composition of Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3 Cl 4 matrix did not match any data in the JCPDS base after careful comparison with the reported calcium aluminate silicate chloride compounds [12] . However, as increase \u03b4 content in our work, the second phase reduces and a single phase of Ca 3\u2212 x \u2212 y Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 (JCPDS No. 50-1542) can be obtained. XRD patterns of Ca 3\u2212 x \u2212 y Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 ( \u03b4 = 1.3): Eu x 2 + , Mn y 2 + with varying Eu 2+ and Mn 2+ concentrations are shown in Fig. 2 . All phases purity of the prepared phosphors were analyzed with JCPDS No. 50-1542 as a reference, indicating that the doped Eu 2+ ions or co-doped Eu 2+ /Mn 2+ ions have not caused any observable change in the Ca 3\u2212 x \u2212 y Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 1.7 Cl 5.2 (CASC) host structure. Fig. 3 shows the powder diffuse reflection spectra of the CASC host, Eu 2+ singly doped, and Eu 2+ and Mn 2+ co-doped samples. It is obvious that the host CASC shows a platform of high reflection in the wavelength range of 300\u2013600 nm and then starts to decrease from 200 to 300 nm, due to the host absorption. We speculate that the strong absorption in the region from 200 to 230 nm might be come from the band-to-band transitions, while the weaker broad absorption over 230\u2013300 nm might be attributed to the tightly bound Frankel excitions, which were usually observed at the place close to the bandgap in large bandgap crystals. When the Eu 2+ ion is singly doped into the host, two broad bands appear between 250 and 400 nm, which are derived from the 4f\u20135d electronic dipole allowed transitions of Eu 2+ ion. For CASC:Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ , a similar spectrum is observed, except for the enhanced absorption intensity. Mn 2+ ions may also contribute to the increased absorption intensity in the wavelength range from 250 to 450 nm by means of the metal\u2013ligand charge transfer band of Mn 2+ \u2013O 2\u2212 and 3d\u20133d forbidden transitions of Mn 2+ ion with the electronic configuration of 3d 5 . The excitation and emission spectra of the Eu 2+ or Mn 2+ singly doped phosphors are shown in Fig. 4 a and b, and the activator mole concentration is 4%. CASC:Eu 2+ shows a blue emission band at about 460 nm, which corresponds to the 4f 6 5d 1 transition of the Eu 2+ . The excitation spectrum monitored at 460 nm shows a broad absorption band within the 200\u2013450 nm UV range, which is due to the transition from the 4f 7 ground state of Eu 2+ to the 4f 6 5d 1 excited state. CASC:Mn 2+ phosphor presents a broad band at 550 nm at 365 nm excitation, which corresponds to the 4 T 1 ( 4 G) \u2192 6 A 1 ( 6 S) transition of Mn 2+ . The excitation spectrum of CASC:Mn 2+ phosphor consists of several bands centered at 359, 428, and 440 nm, which are assigned to the transitions from 6 A 1 (6S) to 4 E( 4 D), 4 T 2 (4D), and 4 T 2 ( 4 G) levels of Mn 2+ , respectively [13] . The intensity of the Mn 2+ emission is weaker than that of the Eu 2+ emission in the CASC host, which is due to the forbidden d\u2013d transition of Mn 2+ . We have observed a significant spectral overlap between the Eu 2+ PL and Mn 2+ PLE spectra, indicating the possibility of energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ in CASC. Fig. 4 c illustrates the PLE and PL spectra of CASC: Eu 0.04 2 + , Mn 0.09 2 + . It is found that the PLE spectrum monitoring the yellow emission of the Mn 2+ is similar to that monitoring the blue emission of Eu 2+ , demonstrating the existence of energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ in CASC systems. While a little difference of PLE spectra between the yellow band and blue band may be attributed to small changes in the crystal field around Eu 2+ with and without Mn 2+ doping. Fig. 5 shows the normalized emission spectra of Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ co-doped CASC various Mn 2+ concentrations. The PL intensity of Mn 2+ at 550 nm increases with increasing Mn 2+ content further supports the occurrence of the ET Eu\u2192Mn mechanism. Moreover, The PL intensity of Mn 2+ emission band was found to redshift with increasing doped Mn 2+ concentration. Similar observations reported by Zhang is attributed to stronger crystal field that changes with an increase in Mn 2+ doping due to shorter Mn\u2013O distances [14] .Here, the remarkable enhancements of the yellow band relative to blue band in these phases are observed with increasing Mn 2+ concentration. The fluorescence lifetimes of Eu 2+ ( \u03c4 1 ) and Mn 2+ ( \u03c4 2 ) are both represented in Fig. 6 . The reduction of the lifetimes for Eu 2+ with increasing Mn 2+ concentrations is observed. These results support the efficient energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ ions. The lifetime of the yellow fluorescence of Mn 2+ remains nearly unchanged, indicating the nonexistence of Mn 2+ concentration quenching within the range of Mn 2+ concentrations of interest in this work. The energy transfer rates ( \u03b7 Eu\u2212Mn ) can be obtained using the equation \u03b7 Eu\u2212Mn = 1\u2212 \u03c4 1 / \u03c4 0 . Where \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 0 are fluorescence lifetimes of Eu 2+ with and without codoping of Mn 2+ , respectively. Fig. 6 inset shows the dependence of the energy transfer rates ( \u03b7 Eu\u2212Mn ) on Mn 2+ concentration. With increasing Mn 2+ dopant content, the \u03b7 Eu\u2212Mn was found out to increase and reach the saturation when x is above 0.21. The excitation and emission spectra suggest that the phosphors CASC: Eu 0.04 2 + , Mn y 2 + are a series of efficient dual-chromatic emitting phosphors with broad absorption bands, matching well with the widely used NUV LED chips (300\u2013410 nm). Fig. 7 shows the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram of the phosphors CASC: Eu 0.04 2 + , Mn y 2 + . The coordinate ( x , y ) of the CASC: Eu 0.04 2 + , Mn y 2 + phosphors varied from (0.16, 0.17) at y = 0 to (0.34, 0.43) at y = 0.21, corresponding to the color tone from blue to near-white and finally to yellow. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, a series of single-composition emission-tunable Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 :Eu 2+ ,Mn 2+ phosphors were synthesized and investigated. The energy transfer from sensitizer Eu 2+ to activator Mn 2+ in Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 host has been studied and demonstrated based on the photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra, and decay lifetime data. The Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 :Eu 2+ ,Mn 2+ phosphor can be tuned from blue to near-white and finally to yellow by adjusting the concentration of Mn 2+ . These results indicated that Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cl 4 \u03b4 :Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ can be a candidate to act as a phosphor for NUV-LEDs.

        "abstract": "There has been considerable interest recently in materials which show prolonged persistent phosphorescence following short periods of excitation; the persistence has been reported in a large variety of phosphor materials including sulfides, oxides, and complex silicates and aluminates. The phosphorescence has generally been attributed to the presence of traps in most instances produced by a co-dopant ion. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the persistent phosphorescence as a function of phosphor particle size and find that the persistence time increases as a function of decreasing particle size. The increase in time is attributable to an increase in surface trapping levels commensurate with changes in the surface to volume ratio in the phosphor particles.",

On the basis of calculating the energy level of the 4f5d configuration, the main 4f5d components that can mix with the 4f2 transitional states are determined. We exhibit the calculated densities of the 4f5d states which can mix with the initial and the final states of 3P0 energy level in Pr3+ doped LiYF4. Whereafter a new set of phenomenological intensity parameters, Tkq, is put forward. In addition to the explicit static-coupling mechanism, the approach is extended by the non-explicit dynamic mechanism. Detailed description of the calculated method is brought out. The results of present fitting are compared with that obtained by the traditional parametrization scheme and obvious improvements are exhibited. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The excitation spectrum of the red band consists of not only a distinct band at 510 nm of itself but also an intense blue band at 450 nm that belongs to the typical Ce3+ ions with green emission, indicating a notable energy transfer from the green emitting Ce3+ ions to the red ones. The energy transfer significantly enables the achievement of a broad emission spectrum covering a red and green spectral region suitable for generating white light upon a blue light-emitting diode (LED) excitation. The decay patterns of the red and green fluorescence are discussed in relation to the effect of energy transfer.

        "abstract": "Lu-modified (Ca2.94-xLuxCe0.06)( Sc 2-yMgy)Si3O12 (CLSMS :Ce 3+) yellow emitting phosphors are prepared by a solid-state reaction. Controllable luminescent intensity and emitting colour are studied as a function of Lu and Mg contents. Fixing the Mg content to be 1, the effect of Lu content on crystal phase formation, luminescence properties and temperature characteristics is studied. It is revealed that the Lu-induced luminescent enhancement is the result of an increase in absorbance of Ce3+ rather than the internal quantum efficiency. Intense and broadband emission is realized by controlling the Lu content to obtain a pure CLSMS crystal phase. The maximum luminescence intensity is obtained at x = 0.54, which is as high as 156% of the Lu-free phosphor. The Lu-containing phosphor also exhibits better temperature characteristics for its big activation energy (0.20 eV) than the Lu-free one (0.18 eV). Combining the present phosphor with a blue light-emitting diode (LED) chip, a white LED with an excellent colour rendering index R a of 86 and a high luminous efficiency of 86 lmW-1 is obtained. The results of the present study demonstrate that the CLSMS :Ce 3+ phosphors show a good performance and are attractive candidates for commercial applications when used in white LEDs. \u00a9 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Tubular micrometer-sized ZnS:Mn2+ constructed by fluffy nanostructures were fabricated in the mixed solutions of water and ethanol in a fixed volume ratio with the aid of ethylenediamine. In the X-ray diffraction pattern, the products obtained in the presence and absence of ethylenediamine show the wurtzite and sphalerite phases, respectively. Field-emission scanning electron microscopic images reveal the evolution process from nanowires to fluffy ZnS:Mn2+ to microtubes with the reaction times of 2, 4, and 8 hours at 100 degrees C, and the basal nanowires are below 10 nm in diameter. Photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectra were investigated. The results suggest that the wurtzite phase, instead of the sphalerite phase ZnS:Mn2+ is luminescence-active for the 4T1 -6A1 transition of the Mn2+ in the ZnS host. The excitation spectra monitored at orange emission bands exhibit sharp peaks at 320, 326 and 327 nm with increasing reaction times of 2, 4, and 8 hours, respectively, indicating the energy transfer from ZnS host to Mn2+ ions, and the blue-shifts compared with the band gap absorption of the bulk counterpart (344 nm) are also observed due to the quantum confinement effects. The formation mechanism of the wurtzite one-dimensional nanostructures at such a low temperature is proposed based on a molecular template mechanism involving the bidentate coordinating ligand, ethylenediamine, and the possible formation mechanism of novel tubular structure are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Nano-powders Y2O3 with various particle sizes and different doping concentrations of Ln (Ln = Tb, Tm, Eu) were prepared by using a combustion technique. The bulky powders doped with concentrations corresponding to nano-powders were obtained by annealing the nano-powders at high temperature. The emission spectra, XRD spectra and TEM were used in the present study. The concentration quenching of luminescent centers and energy transfer between luminescent centers in Y2O3 : Ln nanocrystal powders were investigated. It was found that the behaviors of luminescence concentration quenching for 5D4 --> 7F5 : Tb3+ and 5D0 --> 7F2 : Eu3+ in nano-powders are similar to that in bulky powders. On the contrary, the quenching concentrations for 5D3 --> 7F5 : Tb3+ and 1D2 --> 3H4 : Tm3+ are distinctly higher than that in bulk powders. This owes to the size confinement effect: the interface of nanocrystal particles can stop a portion of the energy transfer, which happens in the bulk ones, between luminescent centers. The size confinement effect can bring different influences to the different types of energy transfer. For instance, it will restrain the energy transfer (governed by electric dipole-dipole interaction) between the ions in long distances, and will hardly affect the energy transfer (governed by exchange interaction) between the ions locating at near intervals.",

The effect of Ce 3 + concentration on the emission intensity of Ca 4Si 2O 7F 2: Ce 3 + is studied, and the emission intensity reaches a maximum at 4% Ce 3 +. Energy transfer from Ce 3 + to Mn 2 + is observed. The emission spectra of the phosphors show a blue broad band at 460 nm of Ce 3 + and a yellow band at 580 nm of Mn 2 +, originate from the allowed 5d \u2192 4f transition of the Ce 3 + ion and the 4T 1g( 4G) \u2192 6A 1g( 6S) transition of the Mn 2 + ion, respectively. Results indicate that the varied emitted color from blue to yellow can be achieved by tuning the relative ratio of the Ce 3 + to Mn 2 + ions based on the principle of energy transfer. We have demonstrated that Ca 4Si 2O 7F 2: Ce 3 +, Mn 2 + phosphors can be a promising candidate for a color-tunable phosphor applied in a near-UV White light emitting diodes. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

But a small proportion of monoclinic structure can be present up to the highest pressure, 36.2GPa. When the pressure is released, the hexagonal structure partly reverts to monoclinic structure, so the sample shows a mixture of hexagonal and monoclinic structure.

        "abstract": "Tubular micrometer-sized ZnS:Mn 2+ constructed by fluffy nanostructures were fabricated in the mixed solutions of water and ethanol in a fixed volume ratio with the aid of ethylenediamine. In the X-ray diffraction pattern, the products obtained in the presence and absence of ethylenediamine show the wurtzite and sphalerite phases, respectively. Field-emission scanning electron microscopic images reveal the evolution process from nanowires to fluffy ZnS:Mn 2+ to microtubes with the reaction times of 2, 4, and 8 hours at 100\u00b0C, and the basal nanowires are below 10 nm in diameter. Photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectra were investigated. The results suggest that the wurtzite phase, instead of the sphalerite phase ZnS:Mn 2+ is luminescence-active for the 4T 1- 6A 1 transition of the Mn 2+ in the ZnS host. The excitation spectra monitored at orange emission bands exhibit sharp peaks at 320, 326 and 327 nm with increasing reaction times of 2, 4, and 8 hours, respectively, indicating the energy transfer from ZnS host to Mn 2+ ions, and the blue-shifts compared with the band gap absorption of the bulk counterpart (344 nm) are also observed due to the quantum confinement effects. The formation mechanism of the wurtzite one-dimensional nanostructures at such a low temperature is proposed based on a molecular template mechanism involving the bidentate coordinating ligand, ethylenediamine, and the possible formation mechanism of novel tubular structure are also discussed.

The fluorescent and phosphorescent properties of CaTiO 3:Pr3+ nanoparticles as a function of particle sizes were investigated by using photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectra as well as time decay patterns of fluorescence and phosphorescence. On the analysis of the longer lifetimes at 300 K as compared to that at 77 K and the appearance of maximal photoluminescence, the dependence of photoluminescence on phosphorescence is demonstrated. A very highly efficient phosphorescence recombination channel in the nanophosphor is proposed and discussed.

        "abstract": "We report intense green luminescence upon blue light excitation in Eu 2+-activated Ca8 Zn (SiO4)4Cl 2 prepared by high temperature solid state reaction with nominal composition of (2-x) CaO-xZnO-SiO2-CaCl2 (0\u2264x\u22641.1). It is observed that the material phase gradually converts from Ca3 SiO4 Cl2: Eu2+ to Ca8 Zn (SiO 4)4 Cl2: Eu2+ followed by improved luminescent properties with increasing x. The two phosphors both emit with a maximum at 505 nm. Significantly, Ca8 Zn (SiO4) 4 Cl2: Eu2+ shows a more intense excitation band in the blue centered at 450 nm. Upon 450 nm excitation, the integrated emission intensity of Ca8 Zn (SiO4)4 Cl 2: Eu2+ is 1.3 times stronger Ca8 Mg (SiO 4)4 Cl2: Eu2+ and nearly the same as Ca3 Sc2 Si3 O12: Ce3+ phosphors. Attempts to understand the origins of the intense luminescence are presented on the basis of diffuse reflection spectra and fluorescence decays of Ca8 Zn (SiO4)4 Cl2: Eu2+ in comparison with related phosphors. The present results suggest that Ca 8 Zn (SiO4)4 Cl2: Eu2+ could be a promising green emitting phosphor for excitation by blue light emitting diodes. \u00a9 2010 The Electrochemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Nanocrystal powders of Y2O3:Tb with different Tb3+ doping concentrations and average sizes were prepared by chemical self-combustion, and the bulk samples of corresponding concentrations were also obtained by annealing nanomaterials at high temperatures. The emission spectra, excitation spectrum, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy images and fluorescence decay curves of Y2O3:Tb nanomaterials and bulk materials were measured. Then the 4f8 \u2192 4f75d1 transition of Tb3+ ions in Y2O3:Tb nanocrystal powders was studied. Great difference in the excitation spectral line shapes for different sized Y2O3:Tb nanocrystal powders was observed. The change of excitation spectral line shapes is because that the Tb3+ ions exist in two very different local environments including the low crystallization degree of close surface and the high crystallization degree inside the particles. The absorption peaks of 4f5d transition are different in these two environments. Also the 5D3 \u2192 5D4 and 5D4 \u2192 5 D4 energy transfer and luminescence concentration quenching caused by energy transfer were investigated. The (5D3, 7 F6) \u2192 (5 D4, 7 F0) energy transfer is caused by interaction of electric dipoles, which is greatly affected by the quantum confinement effect. The concentration quenching of 5D4 \u2192 7F5 luminescence is resulted by the energy transfer of exchange interaction among 5D4 (Tb) energy levels of different Tb3+ ions. The quantum confinement showed little influence on this type of energy transfer.",

        "abstract": "In order to evaluate the possibility of using Cr3+ co-doping to modify the emission properties of Pr3+-based quantum cutting phosphors, which emit one ultraviolet (UV) and one visible photon from each vacuum-UV photon absorbed, into phosphors that emit two visible photons, the optical spectroscopies between 150 and 750nm of CaAl12O 19:M3+ (M \u2264 Pr,Cr) were investigated and compared with those of SrAl12O19:M3+ using synchrotron radiation as one of the excitation sources. When Pr3+ is excited to its 4f5d states, cascade emission of UV photons from the 1S 0 state followed by visible photons from the 3P 0 state are both observed in (Ca,Sr)Al12O 19:Pr3+. Similar to SrAl12O19:M 3+, there exist desirable spectral overlaps between Pr3+ 1S0 emissions and the Cr3+ higher multiplet absorptions in CaAl12O19, which should be favourable to the energy transfer from Pr3+ 1S0 to Cr 3+, converting the UV photon from Pr3+ 1S 0 into the red Cr3+ emission. However, the host absorption band and the Cr3+-related charge transfer band have an unfavourable overlap with the Pr3+ 4f5d states in the vacuum-UV region, preventing efficient selective Pr3+ excitation under radiation of Xe discharge, a prerequisite for the quantum cutting process. \u00a9 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Eu' - -doped C;dzMo309 was prepared by solid-state reaction method using Na2C03 as flux and characterized by pow-der X-ray iliffractometry . According to X-rq diffraction, this material belonged to a tetragonal system with space group 141/a . The ef ects of flus content and sintering temperature on the luminescent properties were investigated with the emis- sion and ex& tion spectra. The results showed that flux content and sintering temperature had effects on the luminescent properties, the optimized flus content and the best temperature was 3% and 800 \"c, respectively. The excitation and emission spect .a also shoi+ed that this phosphor could be effectively excited by C-T band (280 nm) , ultraviolet light 395 nm and blue 1 ght 465 nm . The wavelengths at 395 and 465 nm were nicely fitting in with the widely applied output wave- lengths of ultn \\ iolet or blue LED chips. Integrated emission intensity of Gd2Mo309 : Eu was twice higher than that of Yz0zS Eu3 + L nder 395 nm excitation. The Eu3 + doped GdzMo3Og phosphor may be a better candidate in solid-state light- ing applications.",

        "abstract": "Red-to-blue up-converted emission has been studied for Pr 3+ -doped fluoride nanocrystals-based oxyfluoride glass ceramics. Emission by the 3 P 0 \u2013 3 H 4 transition has been observed upon excitation of the 1 D 2 manifold. The concentration, wavelength and flux dependence of the up-conversion have been investigated at different temperatures from 1.5 K at high spectral resolution. Excitation spectra indicate that the most efficient excitation is at 591.6 nm, which corresponds to the transition of 1 D 2 (II), the second-lowest level of the 1 D 2 manifold. The intensity of the blue emission shows a quadratic dependence on the incident flux. The dynamical processes of this up-conversion have also been examined, suggesting that the energy-transfer process is responsible for the up-converted emission. The different spectroscopic features between nanocrystals and bulk crystals have been characterized, indicating that the local temperature in the nanocrystals is higher than that in bulk crystals due to the lower thermal conductivity of the glass matrix.

Upon 340\u00a0nm excitation, the phosphor shows an asymmetric broadband emission centered at 503\u00a0nm, assigned to the  5d - 4f  transitions of Ce 3\u00a0+ . For Ce 3\u00a0+  doped Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 Cl 2 , a large red-shift (~\u00a069\u00a0nm) and an increased full width at half maximum from 66 to 115\u00a0nm can be observed in comparison with that of the Ce 3\u00a0+  doped Ca 12 Al 14 O 33  sample. In particular, the emission color of the Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 Cl 2 :0.5%Ce 3\u00a0+  phosphor can be tuned from blue to yellow by controlling anions in the nanocages, causing the different lattice deformations. Moreover, the CIE coordinates of the Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 Cl 2 :0.5%Ce 3\u00a0+  phosphor move from yellow to blue as the heating temperature increases from 293 to 623\u00a0K. Our results suggest that the encaged-anion modulation in combination with the heating is an effective strategy for realizing highly color tunable emission of Ce 3\u00a0+  doped in a single host, and furthermore, for designing novel phosphors for UV pumped multi-color LEDs and related devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lanthanide-doped oxide photo-stimulable (PS) phosphors (C12A7:Tb 3+ ) with different encaged anions (O 2\u2212 , H \u2212 , OH \u2212  and e \u2212 ) have been prepared by a combustion method in combination with treatment under different conditions. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and Fourier transform IR (FTIR) transmittance data confirm the existences of encaged electrons, O 2  \u2212  (indicating the existence of encaged O 2-  anions) and OH \u2212  anions in C12A7:Tb 3+ . PS luminescence, thermoluminescence (TL), X-ray storage properties and luminescent kinetics analysis show that the more encaged OH \u2212  anions appear in C12A7, the shallower the depths of the two deeper traps (E trap1 \u00a0=\u00a0\u223c0.72\u00a0eV and E trap2 \u00a0=\u00a0\u223c0.95\u00a0eV), the smaller the glow-peak intensity ratio (I trap2 /I trap1 ), the shorter the X-ray storage time and the lower the quality of X-ray imaging become. Our results suggest that, among all the anions, encaged OH \u2212  anions in C12A7:Tb 3+  play a key role in influencing X-ray storage properties of PS phosphors. High-quality X-ray image with a resolution of \u223c15 line pairs per mm (lp/mm) has been obtained by reducing encaged OH \u2212  anions in PS phosphors. The C12A7:Tb 3+  PS phosphor is a potential candidate material for computed radiography system and erasable/rewritable optical memory media.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Pr 3+ /Yb 3+  codoped CaGdAlO 4  (CGA) quantum cutting phosphors were synthesized by a self-propagating combustion method along with a subsequent heat treatment. For these phosphors, a deep ultraviolet (DUV) to near infrared (NIR) quantum cutting via the energy transfer from Pr 3+  to Yb 3+  ions has been realized under the 4f-5d excitation of Pr 3+  when its 5d level is lower than the  1 S 0 . It can be found that the cascade relaxation processes of the electrons from the excited 4f5d state to the  3 P 0  state play a key role in obtaining the 4f-4f emissions of Pr 3+ . In addition, at the optimal Yb 3+  concentration (6%), the most efficient DUV to NIR quantum cutting can be reached through the dominating two-step energy transfer from Pr 3+  to Yb 3+  upon DUV excitation ranging from 235 to 285\u00a0nm and the quantum cutting efficiency,  \u03b7   QCE  , of the phosphor is \u223c166%. Strikingly, the temperature-dependent NIR emission spectra suggest that these quantum cutting phosphors, having a higher thermal activation energy of 320\u00a0meV, exhibit a good thermal stability. Meanwhile, it is found that the existence of the DUV to NIR quantum cutting gives the phosphor a high resistance to UV irradiation. Our results indicate that Pr 3+ /Yb 3+  codoped CGA quantum cutting phosphors can be a candidate serving as a protective layer for silicon space solar cells.",

Plasmon-enhanced ultraviolet (UV) and blue upconverted emissions of Tm 3+ -doped C12A7 nanocrystals have been achieved by attaching Ag nanoparticles onto the surface of nanocrystals. The enhancement of the upconverted emissions is highly wavelength-dependent. The emission intensities of the sample with Ag +  concentration of 5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22123 \u00a0mol/L at 367 and 476\u00a0nm are enhanced about 10 and 3 times, respectively, relative to the sample without Ag attachment. The enhancement mechanism can be ascribed to surface plasmon resonance due to the highly localized electric field and the increased radiative decay rate around Ag nanoparticles. Our results suggest that Tm 3+ -doped C12A7 nanocrystals by attaching Ag nanoparticles might be a potential material for upconversion, compact and tunable short-wavelength lasers.",

        "abstract": "Control of light\u2010induced electron generation is of vital importance for the application of caged phosphors. For Eu\u2010doped Ca11.94\u2212xSrxAl14O33 caged phosphors, the suppressed effect of strontium doping on the light\u2010induced electrons is observed compared to the europium\u2010free Ca11.94\u2212xSrxAl14O33 phosphors. In the presence of europium ions, Sr doping will promote the reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+. The Rietveld refinement suggests that unit cell volumes of the Ca11.94\u2212xSrxAl14O33:Eu0.06 samples are expanded when Ca2+ ions are replaced by Sr2+ ions. The absorption and FTIR transmittance spectra confirm that the competitive reaction of encaged O2\u2212 anions with H2 is suppressed. For the sample (x=0.48), the higher thermal activation energy (~0.40 eV) for luminescence quenching can be attributed to the more rigid framework structure after Sr doping. For Ca11.94\u2212xSrxAl14O33:Eu0.06 phosphors, their emission colours are tuned from red to purple upon 254 nm excitation and from pink to blue under electron beam excitation through Sr substitution. The insight gained from this work may have a significant guiding to design new phosphors for LED and FEDs and novel nanocaged mutifunctional materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   It has been a challenge to realize high-quality X-ray imaging using oxide-based phosphors for avoiding halogenide-based materials and satisfying the requirements of environmental protection. In this study, lanthanide-doped nanocaged 12CaO\u00b77Al 2 O 3 :Tb 3+  (C12A7:Tb 3+ ) X-ray imaging phosphors with strong photostimulated luminescence (PSL) have been prepared using a combustion method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements suggest that single-phased C12A7:Tb 3+  powders with an average grain size ranging from several hundred nanometers to several micrometers have been obtained at the ignition temperature from 700 to 900\u00a0\u00b0C. PSL, thermoluminescence (TL), electron spin resonance (ESR) and photoconductivity analyses indicate that the storage time of X-ray image exceeds 48\u00a0h due to the existence of deep traps in the C12A7:Tb 3+  phosphor. High-quality X-ray imaging with a resolution of 15 line pairs per mm has been achieved using the phosphor. High conversion efficiency is achieved at 1.28\u00a0pJ/mm 2 /mR, suggesting the application potential of the phosphors in X-ray imaging and medical diagnostics.",

The nanoparticles show a spherical shape with an average size of 40nm and display intense green light (Yb and Er) under the 980nm irradiation. The maximum sensitivity of temperature sensing in the biological temperature range is obtained to be 0.00215K using the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique. Furthermore, after the UCNPs are incubated with Hela cancer cells for 6h, the obvious green sign from Er can be observed under the excitation at 980nm. All the experimental results imply that the PEI/CaF: 1%Er, 2%Yb nanoparticles are excellent candidates for nano-thermometry and have good potential for biological applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Graphene oxides (GO) are decorated on the top surface of ZnO nanorods (NRs) grown on Fe alloy substrates for efficient field emission. The GO decorated ZnO NRs acting as cold electron emitters exhibit excellent field emission performance with the turn-on field  E   to   as low as 1.63\u00a0V/\u03bcm and the threshold field  E   thr   down to 3.12\u00a0V/\u03bcm. ZnO NRs grown on the alloy substrates have a low interfacial resistance and intend to enhance electrical conduction. A schottky contact of Fe-ZnO and matched Fermi levels of ZnO-GO interface contribute to the enhanced current emission efficiency. Besides, some nanometer-scaled sharp protrusions have been formed in the GO sheets, and GO itself owns abundant C-O-C oxygen functional groups that also help to improve the field emission current. A straight line Fowler-Nordheim plot of the field emission current from the emitter is obtained and the effective work function for the decorated GO sheets is calculated from the slope with a value below 1.5\u00a0eV. Finally, field emission mechanism of the GO decorated ZnO NRs has been proposed. This work may help the development of the practical electron sources and advanced optronic devices based on GO field emitters.",

        "abstract": "To obtain white light-emitted diodes (wLEDs) with a low correlated color temperature (CCT) and a high color rendering index (CRI), red-emission is indispensable in their emission spectra. Herein, CaO:Ce3+,Li+,F\u2212 yellow phosphors with more red spectral component have been prepared via a high temperature solid-state reaction. As compared to the F\u2212 undoped samples, CaO:Ce3+,Li+,F\u2212 phosphor have lower critical doping concentration of Ce3+ and show stronger luminescence. At the critical concentration, a quantum efficiency of 66.4% and enhanced thermal and chemical stability were obtained in CaO:Ce3+,Li+,F\u2212. Furthermore, a CaO:Ce3+,Li+,F\u2212-based phosphor-in-glass (PiG) using the red-emitting glass system with the composition of SiO2\u2013Na2CO3\u2013Al2O3\u2013CaO:Eu3+ as the host material was constructed and used for high-power white LED applications. Such PiG samples with different phosphor doping concentrations can satisfy various light color demands and display higher reliability than the CaO:Ce3+,Li+,F\u2212 phosphor. An optimal PiG-based wLED exhibits color coordinates of (0.3769, 0.3386), a CCT of 3774 K, a CRI of 82.5 and a LE of 73.1 when the mass ratio of phosphor to glass matrix was 7\u2006:\u200650 in PiG. Moreover, such PiG-based wLED also showed acceptable color stability under different drive currents. All the above results demonstrate that CaO:Ce3+,Li+,F\u2212 can be expected to be a potential alternative yellow phosphor for blue light excited PiG based warm wLEDs, particularly for high-power devices.",

        "abstract": "At present, blue-red composite LED light sources used for plant lighting are mainly composed of blue light and red light; the blue light is provided by gallium nitride LED chips, but the full-width at half-maximum (FWHW) is only approximately 25 nm, while the blue light required by plants for photosynthesis is wider. Focusing on this problem, this work reported that a dual emitting phosphor-in-glass plate (Dual-PiGP) was prepared towards a high power and dual broadband emitter, in which BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ (BAM) and CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ (CASN) provide blue and red emission, respectively. Dual-PiGP exhibited several merits, including a high quantum efficiency of 93.90%, a superior thermal stability (80.1%@150 \u00b0C of the peak intensity at 25 \u00b0C), and a dual broad spectrum with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 50 and 106 nm at 446 and 645 nm, respectively. Moreover, a proof-of-concept Dual-PiGP plant lamp for application in indoor plant factories was successfully fabricated with Dual-PiGP and a 385 nm emitting LED chip, yielding blue- (400\u2013500 nm) and red-light (580\u2013780 nm) emission that matches well with the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll. The Dual-PiGP plant lamps were applied indoors to cultivate Italian lettuce, and commercial plant lamps assembled by LED chips were chosen as reference. The cultivation results indicated that the biomass of Italian lettuce was 12.12% greater than those cultivated using commercial plant lamps. Further analysis also certificated that the content of soluble protein and total chlorophyll were also improved. The Dual-PiGP light converter strategy provides an option for next-generation plant growth LEDs.",

The phase and structure were analyzed with XRD, EDX, FT-IR measurements. The energy transfer between Ce 3+  and Tb 3+  in SLBO was proved by spectra and decay curves detailedly. The emission colors vary from blue to green by adjusting the ratio of Ce 3+ /Tb 3+  doped concentration. With temperature increasing, SLBO:Ce 3+ ,Tb 3+  phosphor shows well thermal stability that emission intensity retains 70% of its initial at 25\u202f\u00b0C even temperature rising to 150\u202f\u00b0C. The internal and external quantum efficiency of SLBO:3%Ce 3+ ,8%Tb 3+  are 77.5% and 34.8% under 340\u202fnm excitation, respectively. Combining the as-synthesized SLBO:Ce 3+ ,Tb 3+  and red emission phosphor CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+  coated on a 365\u202fnm UV chip, a warm white LEDs device with CRI of 83 was achieved.

        "abstract": "It is general knowledge in persistent luminescence that high-energy illumination, mostly ultraviolet light, is usually necessary in order to effectively charge persistent phosphors. However, the need for high-energy ultraviolet light excitation compromises some applications. In his pioneering work on ruby (Al2O3:Cr3+) laser materials in 1960, Theodore Maiman observed an excited-state absorption phenomenon under the excitation of a high-intensity green-light flash tube. Inspired by Maimanu0027s observation, here we propose a new two-photon up-conversion charging (UCC) concept to effectively charge Cr3+-activated near-infrared persistent phosphors using low-energy, high-intensity visible-light laser diodes. As an example, we demonstrate that a low-energy 635 nm laser diode can produce persistent luminescence in the LiGa5O8:Cr3+ persistent phosphor at the same magnitude as that produced by high-energy 335 nm ultraviolet light from a xenon arc lamp. Moreover, the UCC appears to be a common phenomenon in persistent phosphors containing other UCC-enabling activators such as rare-earth Pr3+ ions and transition metal Mn2+ ions. The UCC technique offers a new way to study persistent luminescence and utilize persistent phosphors; for instance, in bioimaging it makes effective in vivo charging persistent optical probes using tissue-friendly visible light possible.",

        "abstract": "The intense red up-conversion luminescence in ScO:Yb,Er synthesized using a biphasic solvothermal (ST) method was observed upon laser diode pumping at 980 nm. Compared with that found in the bulk sample synthesized using a solid state (SS) reaction at the same sintering temperature (700 \u00b0C), the green and red up-conversion luminescence are enhanced by a factor of 19.7 and 23.4, respectively. The relative red intensity of the sample prepared using the ST method at 700 \u00b0C for 2 h was enhanced up to 6.6 times compared to that obtained by the SS reaction method at 1600 \u00b0C for 6 h. On analyzing the spectral distribution, power dependence and decay curves of Yb, we revealed that the red emission of the Er:F level in ScO:Yb,Er was populated via three possible routes, i.e. excited-state absorption (ESA), two-step energy transfer up-conversion (ET) and non-multiphonon relaxation mechanism from the (H, S) via cross-relaxation and energy back transfer (CRB). For the green up-conversion of the Er:(H, S) level, a three-photon process described as Yb:F + Er:F \u2192 Yb:F + Er:H occurs in the ScO:Yb,Er material. The results indicate that ST-ScO:Yb,Er can act as an efficient up-converting red light emitter and ST-ScO is an appropriate oxide host for up-conversion luminescence.",

        "abstract": "The structural forms of water/deuterated water molecules located on the surface of borosilicate capillaries have been first investigated in this study on the basis of the Raman spectral data obtained at different temperatures and under atmospheric pressure for molecules in bulk and also for molecules absorbed by borosilicate glass surface. The strongest two fundamental bands locating at 3063cm (2438cm) in the recorded Raman spectra are assigned here to the OH (OD) bond stretching vibrations and they are compared with the corresponding bands observed at 3124cm (2325cm) in the Raman spectrum of ice Ih. Our spectroscopic observations have indicated that the structure of water and deuterated water molecules on borosilicate surface is similar to that of ice Ih (hexagonal phase of ice). These observations have also indicated that water molecules locate on the borosilicate surface so as to construct a bilayer structure and that strong and weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds are formed between water/deuterated molecules and silanol groups on borosilicate surface. In accordance with these findings, water and deuterated water molecules at the interface of capillary have a higher melting temperature.",

        "abstract": "Two series of K1-xNaxSrPO4:0.005Eu 2+ and K0.4Na0.6Sr0.995-yPO 4:0.005Eu2+, yTb3+ phosphors are synthesized via a high-temperature solid-state reaction. Their emission color can be tuned from deep blue to blue-green by modulating the crystal field strength and energy transfer. Partial substitution of K+ with Na+ results in a contraction and distortion of the unit cell of the K1-xNa xSr0.995PO4:0.005Eu2+ host, tuning the emission from 426 to 498 nm. The red-shifted emission is attributed to an increased crystal field splitting for Eu2+ in a lowered symmetry crystal field. The tunable emission is further demonstrated in the cathodoluminescence spectra, which indicates that the luminescence distribution of the K1-xNaxSr0.995PO4:0. 005Eu2+ phosphor is very homogenous. Additionally, utilizing the principle of energy transfer, the emission color can be further tuned by co-doping with Tb3+. The chromaticity coordinates for the co-doped phosphor, K0.4Na0.6Sr0.995-yPO 4:0.005Eu2+, yTb3+, can be adjusted from (0.202, 0.406) for y = 0 to (0.232, 0.420) for y = 0.09. The energy transfer processes from the sensitizer (Eu2+) to the activator (Tb 3+) are studied and demonstrated to have a resonance-type dipole-dipole interaction mechanism, with the critical distance of the energy transfer calculated to be 12.46 \u00c5 using a concentration quenching method.

The emissions of 4f-4f transitions from 1\n D\n 2 to the 3\n H\n 4 and 3\n H\n 5 states are found at 620 and 720 nm, respectively. The 3\n P\n 2, 3\n P\n 1, 1\n I\n 6, and 3\n P\n 0 4f-4f absorptions are observed at 456, 472, 482, and 492 nm, respectively. A 4f-5d absorption band is detected at 288 nm. Photoconductivity measurements show that the 4f-5f transition of Pr3+ around 285 nm produces a direct photocurrent. Taking the onset of photocurrent to be at 320 nm, the ground state of Pr3+ is determined at 1.7 eV above the valence band of the host.",

        "abstract": "Novel phosphors of Eu3+, Tb3+ and Tm3+ doped CaZr(PO4)2 were synthesized by solid-state reactions and their x-ray and vacuum ultraviolet-ultraviolet (VUV-UV) spectroscopic properties were investigated. The bands near 147 or 185 nm in the VUV excitation spectra of those doped samples are attributed to the PO4 absorption and O to Zr charge transfer transition in the host. The excitation and emission spectra indicate that the phosphors can be effectively excited by x-ray or 147 nm and 172 nm and exhibit a satisfactory red, green and blue light performance, respectively. Considering the high luminescent intensity, excellent colour purity and chemical stability, CaZr(PO4)2:RE (RE \u2264 Eu3+ Tb3+, Tm3+) are attractive red, green and blue emitting x-ray and plasma display panel phosphors. \u00a9 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Three rare earth borosilicate oxyapatites, RE5Si2BO13 (RE=La, Gd, Y), were synthesized via wet chemical method, of which RE5Si2BO13 (RE=Gd, Y) were first reported in this work. In the three oxyapatites, [BO4] and [SiO4] share the [TO4] tetrahedral oxyanion site, and RE3+ ions occupy all metal sites. The differential scanning calorimetry-thermo gravimetry measurements and high temperature powder X-ray diffraction pattern revealed a vitrification process within 300-1200 \u00b0C, which was due to the glass-forming nature of borosilicates. From the VUV excitation spectra of Eu3+ and Tb3+ in RE5Si2BO13, the optical band gaps were found to be 6.31, 6.54 and 6.72 eV for RE5Si2BO13 (RE=La, Gd, Y), respectively. The emission and excitation bands of Eu3+ and Tb3+ are discussed relating with their coordination environments. Among the three hosts, Y5Si2BO13 would be the best for Eu3+ and Tb3+-doped phosphors. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The glasses used in measurements are with a mol% composition of 70TeO2-9PbF2-190AlF3-10BaF2-1Er2O3. The \u03a9s intensity parameters, the radiative rates, the branching ratios and the fluorescence lifetimes were calculated based upon the Judd-Ofelt theory and the experimental absorption spectrum. Under 980 nm excitation, efficient 530, 544, and 665 nm upconversion emission are due to two-photon absorption processes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Tin selenide (SnSe) shows great potential as a promising anodic candidate of commercial graphite in Li-ion batteries (LIBs), but its practical application is hampered by huge volume change-induced poor cycle span. Herein, a gel-enabled selenization route has been developed for uniformly confining SnSe nanobelts within reduced graphene oxide aerogel (SnSe NB@rGO framework). These unique structural and compositional features make the SnSe NB@rGO framework electrode to show high revisable capacities (620\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg \u22121  after 200 cycles at 0.1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 ), high rate capability (626 and 551\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg \u22121  at 0.5 and 1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 , respectively) and ultralong cycle span (412\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg \u22121  after 800 cycles at 1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 ).",

The bluish-white photoluminescence and phosphorescence originating from the recombination of electrons trapped by anion vacancies and the holes created in the valence band, and the Ti3+ ion substituting for Zr4+ is assumed to be the luminescent center. The long afterglow from Zr O2:Ti is attributed to the oxygen vacancies caused by the addition of Ti3+ ions into Zr O2 host. Compared with the bulk Zr O2:Ti, the nanosized phosphors exhibit a longer persistent time because of the increased surface traps due to the large surface-to-volume ratio in the nanoparticles. This long persistent process can be elucidated by a simple possible mechanism. \u00a9 2008 The Electrochemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Novel Cr(3+) doped zinc gallogermanate (ZGGO) nanoparticles with 697 nm near-infrared (NIR) super long afterglow were prepared via a hydrothermal method. Subsequently, a vacuum-annealing strategy was adopted to improve NIR afterglow in ZGGO:Cr(3+) nanoparticles. For the sample annealed at 800 \u00b0C, no variation in the particle size is observed, the persistent luminescence increases by an order of magnitude (\u223c14 times) and the NIR afterglow time reaches more than 15 hours relative to the as-prepared sample. After annealing at temperatures higher than 880 \u00b0C, the persistent luminescence of the nanoparticles is enhanced, but they show aggregated-surface behavior. Meanwhile, shallow and deep traps are generated, related to the antisite defects and VGe-Cr(3+)-VO defect clusters, respectively. Finally, we apply ZGGO:Cr(3+) persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) to a human serum albumin (HSA) colloid solution, and more than 1 h of NIR persistent luminescence is detected under 320 nm excitation. The quenching effect of NIR luminescence by OH(-) in the HSA solution is observed based on the reduced contribution of surface Cr(3+) in PLNPs to NIR luminescence. Our results suggest that ZGGO:Cr(3+) PLNPs have potential applications for in vivo bio-imaging.",

In this proposed D-SOA, a distributed bundle is designed for remote deploying of bundles and remote calling of services with open services gateway initiative OSGi architecture. Peer-to-peer P2P technology is adopted to improve communication efficiency between terminals of a smart-home system. A specific interaction mechanism is designed to transmit data, using the hypertext transfer protocol HTTP and the extensible markup language XML. Performance analysis shows that the proposed D-SOA achieves up to 37.5% reduction in network load, and 65% improvement in response time, compared to service central system architectures.",

To construct flexible and robust home networks HNs for smart home systems, this paper proposes a novel wireless home networks structure using IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. The proposed approach solves the network address confusion problems which may occur in adjacent HNs in a residential building. In the proposed wireless home network structure, newly arrived network nodes can be correctly configured with unique network addresses. The proposed approach also improves the network robustness by handling unexpected events, caused by migration or departure of nodes within HNs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively restore home networks after destructions of sub-networks; and it achieves nearly 80% network address utilisation ratio.",

This microcantilever sensor could detect Pb(2+) sensitively and selectively in an aqueous solution. Upon complexation with Pb(2+), the DNAzyme duplex unwinded and formed a G-quadruplex conformation, which led to an increase of repulsion between the DNAzyme molecules and a subsequent bending of the microcantilever. This microcantilever sensor could be regenerated, flowing through a strong Pb(2+) chelator, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane- 1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid. The detection limit of the microcantilever sensor for Pb(2+) ions is as low as 10(-8) M. The microcantilever sensor also exhibited a high selectivity to Pb(2+) over other metal ions such as Mg(2+), Fe(3+), Zn(2+), Ca(2+), and Cd(2+).",

Upon exposure to F-, the microcantilevers underwent bending deflection due to the cleavage of Si-O bond on reacting with F- in the hydrogel. The results show that the maximum bending deflections are proportional to the concentrations of F-, and the limits of detection are 10(-8) M and 10(-9) M for the two microcantilevers, respectively. Other ions, such as Cl-, Br-, NO3-, H2PO4-, HSO4-, and AcO- have little effect on the deflection of the microcantilevers. The results show that the microcantilever may be used for in situ quantitative detection of F- in an aqueous solution and the mechanism of the bending are discussed.",

The combined process of first BAF-ozone-second BAF (BAF1-O3-BAF2) was proved the optimal combined way. Under the optimal condition of 100mg/L ozone dosage, BAF1 HRT (hydraulic retention time) 9h and BAF2 HRT 6h, the CN-, COD (chemical oxygen demand), Cu2+ and Ni2+ removal efficiencies were 99.7%, 81.7%, 97.8% and 95.3%, respectively and the effluent CN-, COD, Cu2+ and Ni2+ concentrations of 0.16mg/L, 55.0mg/L, 0.38mg/L and 0.41mg/L, respectively satisfied the discharge standard for electroplating (China). The results show that BAF1 can tolerate higher cyanide toxicity than some other bioreactors. Furthermore, the addition of glucose into raw electroplating wastewater (EPWW) could increase contaminants removal efficiencies of BAF1. Cyanide compounds of EPWW could be used as the nitrogen source for the microorganisms. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

Acids-citric acid and oxalic acid were chosen to simulate the root exudates in rhizosphere. The results showed that nutrient release of MAP could be obviously promoted by organic acids. The amounts of dissolved N and P in organic acids were significantly higher than that in water. For MAP the dissolving ability of citric acid was better than that of oxalic acid at normal temperature. It made clear that the nutrient release of MAP had a positive correlation with the temperature rise and increased to a level-off along with time. The length of time taken to reach equilibrium was concerned with temperature. The dissolution of MAP could improve the buffering ability of the rhizosphere soil. It was further proved that MAP was an ideal slow-release fertilizer,which was favorable for plants.",

        "title": "Treatment of acid rose dye containing wastewater by ozonizing \u2013 biological aerated filter",
        "abstract": "The ozonizing \u2013 biological aerated filter process was used to treat the acid rose dye containing wastewater. The most suitable conditions were identified as follows: the mass ratio of ozone to dye = 4.5, temperature t = 18\u201325 \u00b0C, HRT = 3 h and gas/liquid = 4:1. Experimental results showed that ozonizing process had an excellent de-color efficiency and could improve the biodegradability of wastewater. With ozonizing the BOD/COD ratio increased from 0.18 to 0.36, and as a result, the subsequent biological aerated filter could be more effective for further reducing COD and SS concentrations, especially for wastewater with low concentration of SS and COD. After treatment the effluent COD was less than 40 mg/L, SS about 50 mg/L and color less than 20\u00b0. It can meet the water quality standards of the treated water reused for industry cooling water. Keywords Dyeing wastewater Acid rose dye Ozone Biological aerated filter Refractory wastewater 1 Introduction Some dye wastewater, containing various refractory organic pollutants from residual dye, is often discharged into the water environment without appropriate treatments. In order to remove refractory organic pollutants effectively from this kind of wastewater, the optimal treatment process with high quality effluent and low operating cost must be selected, and moreover appropriate operating conditions of the wastewater treatment process are required. The acid rose dye belongs to xanthene dye which is nonbiodegradable both in aerobic and anaerobic processes [1] , and because of its high solubility in water, it is impossible to remove by coagulation. So when a dyeing process mainly used acid rose dye, the wastewater was refractory. At present, the most common treatment for this kind of wastewater is using chloros to de-color via oxidation, but chloros oxidation reduces chemical oxygen demand (COD) only slightly. As a result, it is not able to reach the discharge standard of water pollutants for dye industry. At the same time chloros oxidation produce Trihalomethanes (THMs) which may pose cancer risk [2] . It was found that refractory organic pollutants could become biodegradable after appropriate chemical oxidation [3,4] . The biological treatment unit was followed to reduce COD in order to reach the standard of wastewater discharge or gray water utilization. Due to the characteristic of acid rose red dye containing wastewater which is deep in color and refractory, a combination process of ozonizing \u2013 biological aerated filter (BAF) was used. Ozone has outstanding performance in removing the organic pollutants, algae, taste, color and control mutagenic matters. This oxidizer is highly efficient, decomposes quickly and causes no secondary pollution. It is a very promising advanced oxidation process in wastewater treatment. Biological aerated filter (BAF), which incorporates an inert medium to support biomass and filter out suspended solids, is an alternative to the traditional activated sludge process, has the excellent character in removal of suspended solids (SS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and ammonia nitrogen, especially for low SS and COD wastewater. The key of the process was ozone for oxidizing pretreatment, which increased the biodegradability of the wastewater, and most of the organic matter was removed in the next step by BAF. 2 Experimental 2.1 Model wastewater preparation The acid rose dye is widely used for polyamide fabric dyeing. It is estimated that producing 1 ton of this kind of fabric will consume 2 kg of dye, 2.5 kg of degreasing agent and dye leveler, and discharge about 10 tons of wastewater. Ten percent of dye is wasted and discharged into the wastewater, and this kind of wastewater contains many pollutants such as residual acid rose dye, auxiliaries, and chemical impurities which are left in the fabric. The model wastewater was confected in the laboratory according to the main pollutants found in practical wastewater, i.e., acid rose dye of mass concentration 30 mg/L, degreasing agent and dye leveler of concentration 200 mg/L. The model wastewater quality is shown in Table 1 . 2.2 Apparatus and operation The experimental apparatus mainly composed of two parts; one part was the ozone oxidation equipment, while another part was biological aerated filter treatment apparatus. Fig.\u00a01 shows the schematic of the process. All equipments are tabulated in Table 2 . The ozonizer flow rate was measured by the air flowmeter and with the concentration of ozone which was surveyed in advance, and so the ozone dosage can be calculated. There was a pore bubbler in the bottom of the ozone reactor which made the ozone dissolve into the wastewater quickly. 2.3 Analytical method Standard methods of P.R. China was used for measuring color degrees, pH, COD and BOD 5 of the wastewater. The concentration of ozone was measured by iodimetry [5] . In addition, the experiment had drawn the biodegradation curve of COD to estimate the aerobic biodegradability of wastewater [6] . 2.3.1 Definitions and units of biodegradation curve The amount of degradation attained at the end of the test is reported as the Biodegradability in the Zahn\u2013Wellens test: D T = [ 1 \u2212 ( C T \u2212 C B ) ( C A \u2212 C BA ) ] \u00d7 100 where: D T = biodegradation (%) at time T , C A = COD values in the test mixture measured 3 h after the beginning of the test (mg/L), C T = COD values in the test mixture at time T of sampling (mg/L), C B = COD value of the blank at time T of sampling (mg/L), C BA = COD value of the blank, measured 3 h after the beginning of the test (mg/L). The extent of degradation is rounded to the nearest full percent. Percentage degradation is stated as the percentage COD removal of the tested substance. 2.3.2 Plot of biodegradation curve Activated sludge, mineral nutrients and the test material as the sole carbon source in an aqueous solution are placed together in a glass vessel equipped with an agitator and an aerator. The mixture is agitated and aerated at 20\u201325 \u00b0C under diffuse for up to 28 days. The degradation process is monitored by determination of the COD values in the filtered solution daily or at other appropriate regular time intervals. The ratio of eliminated COD after each interval to the value 3 h after the start is expressed as percentage biodegradation which serves as the measure of the extent of degradation at this time. The result is plotted versus time to give the biodegradation curve. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of ozonizing oxidation on de-color efficiency Fig.\u00a02 shows the effect of O 3 /dye ratios on the de-color efficiency in the oxidation of the model wastewater by ozone. The de-color ratio increased with increase in the ozone dosage. When the mass ratio of ozone to dye was 4.5, the de-color efficiency was up to more than 99%, and the color degree of the resulting model wastewater was less than 20 after oxidation. When the ratio of ozone to dye was 3.6, the color degree of model wastewater was about 40 after ozone oxidation. The results thus indicated that ozone oxidation had excellent de-color efficiency. 3.2 Effect of ozonizing oxidation on COD removal The COD removal from the model wastewater by ozonizing oxidation is shown in Fig.\u00a03 . When the ratio of ozone to dye was increased from 3.6 to 4.5, the COD removal efficiency of the model wastewater achieved was about 30%, and continuous increase of ozone dosage had not increased the efficiency in COD removal quickly. 3.3 Effect of ozonizing oxidation on biodegradability of wastewater In general, chemical oxidation can change the molecular structure of compounds which are nonbiodegradable and rupture them into smaller molecules, the intermediate products usually have better aerobic biodegradability than original compounds [7] . This experiment studied the biodegradation curve of the model wastewater which had been subjected to ozone oxidation treatment in the ratio of ozone to dye 3.6 and 4.5, respectively. The biodegradation curves of oxidation influent and effluent are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . A significant increase in the biodegradability ( Figs. 4 and 5 ) shown in the experiment with ozone oxidation not only shortened the adaptive period of the microbe greatly, but also increased the value of COD B /COD from 0.3 to 0.6 (COD B was the total COD which can be biodegraded at the end of the Zahn\u2013Wellens test). According to the conversion relation of COD B and BOD, the value of BOD/COD, achieved as 0.36 after ozone oxidation, shows that the model wastewater had become biodegradable. 3.4 Wastewater treatment by ozonizing \u2013 biological aerated filter process 3.4.1 Effect of ozone dosage on COD removal The model wastewater was treated by the ozonizing \u2013 biological aerated filter process in which the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of BAF was fixed at 5 h, the ratio of gas to liquid was 4 and the temperature of wastewater was 18\u201325 \u00b0C, and change in the addition of ozone dosage was carried out. The experimental results are shown in Table 3 . The COD removal ratio of the non-ozone process was only 30% and the color degrees even had slight rise. On the other hand, when the process added ozone to pre-oxidation, the removal rate of COD and color degrees had increased significantly; when the ratio of ozone to dye was 4.5, COD removal rate of the model wastewater was 91.5% and the color of effluent was reduced to about 20\u00b0. 3.4.2 Effect of hydraulic retention time of BAF on COD removal On the other hand, in determining the effect of hydraulic retention time, we fixed the ratio of ozone to dye at 4.5, the ratio of gas to liquid was 4 and the temperature of wastewater was 18\u201325 \u00b0C, and changed the hydraulic retention time of BAF. The treatment efficiency of this process is shown in Fig.\u00a06 . In the experiment performed with the hydraulic retention time of BAF at 3 h, the average COD of effluent was about 33 mg/L and the COD average removal rate of the process reached about 88%. In the case of 5 h, the average COD was reduced to 25 mg/L and the average removal rate was 91.5%. In the case of 7 h, the average COD was decreased further to 16 mg/L and the average COD removal rate went up to 95%. The process showed excellent treatment efficiency for the model wastewater. 4 Conclusions (1) The ozone oxidation showed excellent performance in the decolorization of acid rose red dye containing wastewater. When added at the ratio, of ozone to dye, of 4.5, the de-color efficiency of the model wastewater was more than 99% and the color of effluent reduced to 20\u00b0. (2) The ozone oxidation could significantly improve the biodegradability of the model wastewater. When used at the ratio, of ozone to dye, of 4.5, the value of BOD/COD increased from 0.18 to 0.36. (3) The ozonizing \u2013 biological aerated filter process is a promising technology for refractory wastewater treatment. In the treatment of the model wastewater, the color of effluent obtained was 20\u00b0, COD less than 40 mg/L and SS about 50 mg/L. The treatment cost was about 2 yuan RMB per ton wastewater, suggesting that the ozonizing \u2013 biological aerated filter is an effective process for this kind of wastewater treatment in terms of its high quality effluent and low operating cost.

According to process comparison, it was found that ozone oxidation and Fenton reagent oxidation both had some effect in the advanced oxidation, but the former was easy operation. The biological aerobic filter (BAF) had better COD removal effect than that of biological contact oxidation whether the wastewater was preoxidized or not, which removed 70% COD. Therefore, the process of BAF-ozone-BAF was selected. When the hydraulic retention time of frontal BAF was 12 hour with 20:1 gas-water ratio, the ozone dosage was 550 mg\u00b7L-1, and the hydraulic retention time of latter BAF was 24 hour with 10:1 gas-water ratio, the COD concentration of effluent was less than 100 mg\u00b7L-1.

The results showed that: when the best hydraulic load of BAF was 1 m3 /(m2 \u00b7 h), the CODCr removal rate and TSS removal rate were 85% and 24% respectively. The back-washing was operated once per 12~15 d, the effluent met the class I discharge standard of Discharge Limits of Water Pollutants (DB44/266-2001) in Guangdong province. When wastewater from retention tank with high CODCr was added into buffer tank, BAF had high ability to resist the impact load, and CODCr removal rate still was at about 80%, effluent also met discharge standard, but back-washing was operated once per 2~3 d.

        "abstract": "A new type of catalyzed carrier-iron oxide coated sand was used in this study.It was found that the pore diameter,and the particle aperture of the iron oxide coated sand were about 100 nm.It also showed that hydroxy-Fe with low polymerization degree intercalated into the interlamination of raw quartz sand successfully.The stability of the coated sand was evaluated through repeated test.The results showed that with pH of 3.0\uff5e4.0,H2O2 of 10 mmol\u00b7L-1,coated sand dosage of 40 g\u00b7L-1,and Fe2+ dosage just about 0.2 mmol\u00b7L-1,97.5% discoloration of MO was achieved under visible irradiation after 100 min treatment.Furthermore,decoloration efficiency was still higher than 70% after the coated sand being used for 5 cycles.Hence,it had demonstrated that the iron oxide coated sand can be successfully used in the fenton-Fluidized Bed process for AOP wastewater treatment.",

        "abstract": "Stable nitritation for low-strength ammonium wastewater was the key obstacle for cost-effective and low-carbon biological nitrogen removal. A zeolite biological fixed bed (ZBFB) and an anoxic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) were successfully applied for achieving nitritation-denitrification of low-strength ammonium wastewater by adsorption, biological desorption and denitrification. Based on free ammonia inhibition on biofilm, stable nitrite accumulation could be realized with suitable operational time and aeration in biological desorption. During cycle operation, adsorption effluent NH-N kept at 3.0-4.0\u202fmg/L, biological desorption effluent NO-N maintained at 226.8-243.2\u202fmg/L with average nitrite accumulation ratio of 97.18%, and nitrite removal rate was about 0.628-0.672\u202fkg NO-N\u00b7m\u00b7day, revealing obvious feasibility of ZBFB and ASBR for low-strength ammonium wastewater treatment. High-throughput sequencing analysis results further presented significant microbial community variations happened after cycle operation, with ammonia oxidizing bacteria enrichment and nitrite oxidizing bacteria inhibition in ZBFB and dominance of denitrifiers in ASBR.",

        "abstract": "Denitrifying granular sludge reactor holds better nitrogen removal efficiency than other kinds of denitrifying reactors, while this reactor commonly needs seeding anaerobic granular sludge and longer period for start-up in practice, which restricted the application of denitrifying granular sludge reactor. This study presented a rapid and stable start-up method for denitrifying granular sludge. An upflow sludge blanket (USB) reactor with packings was established with flocculent activated sludge for treatment of high concentration nitrite wastewater. Results showed mature denitrifying granular sludge appeared only after 15\u00a0days with highest nitrogen removal rate of 5.844\u00a0kg\u00a0N/(m\u00a0day), which was much higher than that of compared anoxic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR). No significant nitrite inhibition occurred in USB and denitrification performance was mainly influenced by hydraulic retention time, influent C/N ratio and internal reflux ratio. Hydraulic shear force created by upflow fluid, shearing of gaseous products and stable microorganisms adhesion on the packings might be the reasons for rapid achievement of granular sludge. Compared to inoculated sludge and ASBR, remarkable microbial communitiy variations were detected in USB. The dominance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and enrichment of species Pseudomonas_stutzeri should be responsible for the excellent denitrification performance, which further verified the feasibility of start-up method.",

SBR filled with synthetic zeolite (SSBBR) and natural zeolite (NSBBR) were applied to evaluate the NH-N adsorption capacity impacts on nitrogen transformation and microbial characteristics. Significant differences in nitrite production rate (NPR) were both observed in two reactors during 4 different alkalinity ratios. The highest NPR in SSBBR and NSBBR were both obtained when the alkalinity ratio was 5:1 with the values of 1.11 and 0.90\u202fkg\u202fN/(m\u00b7d), respectively. According to Haldane model with inhibition by FA, the kinetics of the reaction were analyzed.

Moreover, Anammox was used for further nitrogen removal from IORW and stable total nitrogen (TN) removal was obtained at the influent NH-N concentration of 567\u202fmg/L and TN removal efficiency kept above 70.0% after 100\u202fdays operation. High throughput sequencing-based approaches showed that Nitrosomoadaceae (AOB) and Kuenenia was dominance in two-stage ZBAF and Anammox samples respectively, while Nitrospire and Nitrobacter (NOB) undetected.

The highest nitrite production rate (NPR) of 1.357\u202fkg/(m\u00b7d) and nitrite accumulation rate (NAR) of 99.0% was achieved with salt free wastewater. While after adding extra salt, NPR and ammonium removal efficiency (ARE) presented an obvious decline trend. The lowest NPR (0.599\u202fkg/(m\u00b7d)) and ARE (34.2%) were obtained with salinity of 25.0\u202fg/L NaCl. It has been confirmed that addition of salt resulted in the increase of free ammonia (FA), and then further inhibited ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB). High-throughput sequencing analysis results further revealed that the relative abundance of AOB decreased in ZBAF. All results demonstrated that AOB was inhibited not only by high osmotic pressure caused by salt, but also by high FA.",

A zeolite biological fixed-bed (ZBFB) was successfully established for 6.0-8.0 \u00b0C low-strength ammonium wastewater treatment via adsorption-regeneration. Ion exchange was a remarkable alternative and zeolite was mostly applied. Nevertheless, insufficient zeolite bio-regeneration rate was the key obstacle for economically sustainable utilization. By adsorption, effluent NH-N was around 1.5-2.5 mg/L. About 26% regeneration rate was obtained. With a ceramsite biological aerobic filter (CBAF) operated with ZBFB in series at the regeneration stage, the regeneration rate reached 95%, 3.5 times higher. Studies of alkalinity effects on bio-zeolite regeneration process indicated that NaCO worked better than NaHCO. Greater amount and one dose mode of alkalinity addition, higher regeneration rate could be obtained. The bio-zeolite regeneration process followed pseudo first-order kinetics with K = 0.0629 h. High-throughput sequencing analysis indicated the enriched nitrifying microorganisms in CBAF fully oxidized NH-N in regeneration solution, which accelerated desorption and conversion of NH-N by the circulation of regeneration solution between ZBFB and CBAF. The dynamic adsorption experiment proved that ZBFB-CBAF was feasible for cold low-strength ammonium wastewater treatment.",

High ammonium removal efficiency, stable nitrite accumulation rate and total nitrogen removal efficiency was higher than 95.0%, 90.0% and 66.4%, respectively, implying potential application of this process for nitrogen removal of mature landfill leachate. Efficient nitrite accumulation in the first oxic reactor depended on low DO conditions and sufficient alkalinity. However, operational limit was mainly decided by actual hydraulic retention time (AHRT) of the first oxic reactor and appeared with AHRT less than 13.9h under DO of 0.3-0.5mg/L. High-throughput sequencing analysis demonstrated significant change of bacterial diversity in the first oxic reactor after a long-term operation and dominant bacteria genus Nitrosomonas was shown to be responsible for NH4(+)-N removal and nitrite accumulation under low DO levels.

Owning to the adsorption of zeolite to ammonium, free ammonia (FA) concentration could remain at an appropriate range for inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and dominance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), which should be responsible for the excellent partial nitrification realized in ZBAF. Kinetic study showed that the production of nitrite in ZBAF followed the zero-order kinetics model and high-throughput sequencing analysis further presented the enrichment of AOB and inhibition of NOB in ZBAF. All the results demonstrated that ZBAF hold a great potential in the application of partial nitrification for ammonium wastewater treatment.",

We aimed to investigate the association between PFAAs in blood and semen, explore a potential link between PFAAs exposure and semen quality in the population of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in China, one of the \"world factories\". The monitoring results demonstrated that the population (103 male participants) from the PRD region in this study had higher PFAAs levels in blood and semen than some other areas in China. PFOS was found at the highest mean concentrations of 118.16\u202fng/mL in blood and 5.31\u202fng/mL in semen among the nine PFAAs. Significant associations were found between concentrations of several analytes in blood and semen, including \u03a3 PFAAs (r\u202f=\u202f0.475, P\u202f<\u202f.01), PFOA (r\u202f=\u202f0.215, P\u202f=\u202f.029), PFHS (r\u202f=\u202f0.458, P\u202f<\u202f.01) and PFOS (r\u202f=\u202f0.981, P\u202f<\u202f.01). BMI was the most important factor to PFAAs, but there was no significant difference in PFAAs concentrations in blood and semen collected from participants with different smoking and drinking habits, education background and occupations. Negative correlations were significantly observed between sperm motility and PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFBS, PFOA, PFHS, PFOS and \u03a3PFAAs in semen. Therefore, exposure to PFAAs may result in a decline in semen mobility in participants from the PRD region.",

        "abstract": "Acrylamide grafted cationic guar gum (CGG-g-PAM), induced by ceric ammonium sulfate, was synthesized using aqueous polymerization technique at 10 \u00b0C and the flocculation property was studied with high-turbidity tobacco wastewater (NTU > 4500). Thus five grades of graft copolymers were obtained through alteration of initiator and monomer concentrations in order to understand the effect of molecular weight on flocculation. The grafted copolymer was characterized by FTIR and SEM. Study of DTG demonstrated that CGG-g-PAM had better heat-resistant performance than guar gum, cationic guar gum (CGG) and polyacrylamide. The dosage of polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and CGG-g-PAM, pH value and molecular weight were considered to be the factors that can influence flocculation efficiency. The result showed best flocculation efficiency occurs at pH 5 when the dosage of CGG-g-PAM and PAC are 3.6 ppm and 120 ppm, respectively. The percentage of turbidity and COD removal are 98% and 24% correspondingly, and its flocculating efficiency prevails over that of CGG and cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM). Keywords CGG-g-PAM Characterization Flocculation Tobacco wastewater 1 Introduction Guar gum is a kind of plant glue. This polysaccharide is formed by galactose and mannose molecules. The principal backbone is a chain of (1 \u2192 4)-\u03b2-linked d -mannopyranosyl units, with single (1 \u2192 6)-\u03b1- d -galactopyranosyl units linked to the main chain. The mannose to galactose ratio is 2 (see Fig. 1 ). Natural guar gum dissolves easily with stirring in cold water. Its aqueous solution can confer high viscosity. Guar gum can bear high shearing rate and is usually employed as a thicker mainly in the food, cosmetic and strengthening agent in paper industry. However it is difficult to control the solution viscosity due to degradation caused by microorganism which limits its application. Modification of polysaccharides such as guar gum [1] , hydroxypropyl guar gum [2] , sodium alginate [3] and starch [4] is usually carried out by grafting acrylamide. And thus, flocculation property is increased and biodegradation degree is restrained which leads to wide application for industrial wastewater treatment, papermaking wet end and cosmetics. Singh et al. [2,5,6] had synthesized hydroxypropyl guar gum grafted acrylamide copolymer as flocculation agent. It was reported that the copolymer had superior flocculation efficiency to ungrafted polysaccharide as well as polyacrylamide homopolymer. This research pointed out that flexible polyacrylamide side chain grafted onto backbone of rigid mannose would tend to form loop or ring and extend some distance from the particle surface into aqueous phase. The copolymer would approach the contaminant with ease. Solution polymerization of acrylamide grafted guar gum induced by Ce(IV) have the advantage of high efficiency and rapid reaction rate. So many researches have focused on copolymerization of acrylamide grafted guar gum or hydroxypropyl guar gum. But grafted copolymer of acrylamide with cationic guar gum (CGG) have rarely been studied. CGG have been widely adopted in papermaking as drainability, retention agent, and strengthening chemicals [7,8] due to its cationic quarternary group in its molecule structure. Its performance depends on the content of nitrogen. Moreover CGG and CGG-g-PAM [9] may also be utilized treating bentonite suspension and municipal wastewater with good flocculation efficiency. However there are some features during solution copolymerization of acrylamide with CGG which have never been studied. These characterizations involves the aqueous copolymerization mediated by Ce(IV) may take place at 10 \u00b0C with high reaction rates and the highest grafting efficiency of beyond 95%. Thus copolymer of CGG-g-PAM was synthesized at low temperature and flocculation effect for high turbidity of tobacco wastewater was studied in this paper with comparing to CGG and commercial CPAM. The effects of dosage of copolymer, pH value and molecular weight on the percentage of turbidity and COD removal were also discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials CGG was made in our laboratory. Ceric ammonium sulphate was supplied by Bodi Chemical Company. Acrylamide was procured from Tianjing kemio Chemical Agent Ltd. CPAM was provided by Nanfang Science Ltd. Polyaluminium chloride (PAC) was provided by Henan Chemical Company and dissolved in distilled water to obtain 5 wt% aqueous for use. Wastewater of tobacco had the characters of average COD of 5200 ppm, average turbidity of 4957 NTU, average colour degree of 2845 and pH 5.0. 2.2 Graft copolymerization CGG-g-PAM was synthesized by grafting acrylamide (AM) onto CGG through radical polymerization method in an aqueous system using Ce(IV)/nitric acid redox initiator. The procedure was adopted in carrying out the reactions as follows. One gram CGG was dissolved in distilled water (125 cm 3 ) in a three-neck flask under constant stirring. The flask was then flushed with nitrogen for 30 min. The required amount of AM and 10 ml distilled water was added into the solution. The solution was stirred for 15 min while being bubbled with nitrogen. The required amount of Ce(IV) solution (in 0.5 M HNO 3 ) was added. The nitrogen flow was continued for another 10 min, and the flask was sealed with tape. The reaction temperature was maintained at 10 \u00b0C by immersing the flask in a constant temperature bath pan with adding ice-water continuously. Finally the mixture was neutralized to pH 6.5\u20137 by addition of concentrated 0.05 M NaOH\u2013ethanol solution. The white precipitate was filtered on a sintered glass filter with suction. The solid was thoroughly washed with 80% (v/v), then 90% (v/v), and finally pure ethanol. The product was dried to constant weight at 65 \u00b0C at vacuum pressure of 0.1 MPa. Five grades of CGG-g-PAM were synthesized by altering initiator and monomer concentration. The details were given in Table 1 . 2.3 Purification of the grafted copolymer There were CGG-g-PAM, PAM, unreacted monomer and residual initiator in the mixture. So it was necessary to separate the grafted copolymer from the crude product. The extraction of occluded PAM was carried out by solvent extraction using a mixture of glycol and ice acetic acid (6:4 by volume). The detailed procedure was as follows: 2 g of crude graft copolymer was taken in a 250 cm 3 beaker. Then 100 ml of the solvent was added, and the whole substrate was kept at 30 \u00b0C for 24 h. After that the mixture was filtered using Buchner funnel. The residue was washed with same solvent mixture for 2\u20133 times to remove the PAM thoroughly. Then the product was washed with ethanol again and kept for 12 h. Finally it was dried at 65 \u00b0C in a vacuum oven. 2.4 Intrinsic viscosity and molecular weight measurements The molecular weight ( M w ) of the pure grafted copolymer were determined from the intrinsic viscosity [ \u03b7 ] measurements. Ub belohde viscometer was used to measure viscosity at 25 \u00b0C in l M NaNO 3 solution. The weight-average M w was then calculated from [ \u03b7 ], dl/g values using the following Mark\u2013Houwink equation. (1) [ \u03b7 ] = 6.31 \u00d7 10 - 5 [ M w ] 0.80 The contribution of CGG was neglected when measuring the M w of grafted copolymer for the mass ratio of PAM, CGG had a value of higher than 9 during the polymerization of CGG-g-PAM. 2.5 FTIR spectra, DTG and SEM study The structure of CGG-g-PAM, GG, CGG and PAM were determined by Fourier Transform IR spectra. The thermal analysis of GG, CGG and CGG-g-PAM were carried out by NETZSCH TG209 F1(DTG, Germany). The heating rate was uniform in all cases at 10 \u00b0C/min in an atmosphere of nitrogen, starting from room temperature up to 600 \u00b0C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures were obtained by XL-30 ESEM (Philip Company, The Netherlands). The samples in the powered form were mounted on the specimen stubs and coated with gold ion using IB.5 Ion Sputtering Apparatus. The voltage was 10 KV and the micrographs were taken at a magnification of 800. 2.6 Measurement of flocculation properties 6-United Flocculator, pH meter and DR/2010 Portable Nephelometer from HACH Company were used. The flocculation studies on tobacco wastewater were carried out using the 6-united Flocculator. All the samples were dissolved in quantity of distilled water to obtain 0.2 wt% solution. This test was operated as following procedure: the initial rate of mixing was 250 r/min with stirring for 5 min. Then the rate was declined to about 50 r/min with stirring for 2 min. Finally, the stirrer was switched off and the flocs were allowed to settle for 10 min. The supernatant turbidity values and COD values were measured by portable Nephelometer and DR/2010 instrument (using distilled water as blank sample). The percentage of turbidity and COD removal (%) were calculated according to the following formula: (2) Percentage of turbidity removal ( % ) = ( turbidity value of treated water - turbidity value of original water ) \u00d7 100 / turbidity value of original water (3) Percentage of COD removal ( % ) = ( COD value of treated water - COD value of original water ) \u00d7 100 / COD value of original water 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of graft copolymers The IR spectra of GG, CGG, PAM, and CGG-g-PAM are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that a broad absorption band in GG, CGG and CGG-g- PAM at round 3400 cm \u22121 is due to the stretching frequency of the O\u2013H groups. In the case of CGG, absorption band at 1300 cm \u22121 is for the C\u2013N stretching frequency of quarternary-ammonium which is not seen in IR spectra of GG. The IR spectra of CGG-g-PAM shows that two bands around 1654 cm \u22121 and 1416 cm \u22121 are due to C O and N\u2013H stretching vibration bands of the amide group which is correlated with 1660 cm \u22121 and 1415 cm \u22121 band of PAM. As PAM is initially removed from grafted products, the presence of above bands in the graft copolymer is a strong evidence of grafting. The grafting has been supported by DTG and SEM analysis ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). All details of weight loss and corresponding temperatures are summarized in Table 2 . In case of GG and CGG, two distinct zones are observed where the weight to be lost. The initial weight loss of 6.61% happens at 74.67 \u00b0C and 59 \u00b0C which is due to evaporation of solvent in these two samples. The second degradation zone where the polymer decomposition takes place is 333.37 \u00b0C for GG and 282.47 \u00b0C for CGG. These data show that CGG has the worse heat resistance property because the quarter ammonium is easy to break up. However, in the case of PAM there is a continuous loss of weight with increase in the temperature up to 140 \u00b0C after the initial loss of weight because of some amount of moisture. And then the maximum weight loss of 53.71% happens at 300.15 \u00b0C due to the loss of NH 2 group in the form of ammonium. However the degradation of the copolymer (CGG-g-PAM) takes place in three stages. The first stage is as the same as GG, CGG and PAM at <100 \u00b0C. The second stage decomposition (starting from 201.5 \u00b0C) is for the degradation of both PAM and CGG chains. The loss of weight is increased with further increasing of temperature. At third stage the copolymer degrades at the starting temperature of 362.18 \u00b0C which is higher than PAM. Meanwhile the weight loss of 47.51% is lower than that of 53.71% for PAM. It is obvious that CGG-g-PAM is more stable than CGG and PAM. Thus it is concluded the grafting of PAM chains onto the polysaccharide backbone enhances the thermal stability of the polysaccharide. Fig. 4 shows the scanning electron micrographs of GG, CGG and CGG-g-PAM. Surface morphology of GG shows a smooth and tight structure. However, CGG shows a different microcosmic structure which is coarse, loose and wrinkled so that CGG can favor the polymerization. CGG-g-PAM shows piece and more coarse surface. Thus grafting has taken place certainly. 3.2 Effect on CGG-g-PAM flocculation properties 3.2.1 Effect of dosages of CGG-g-PAM and PAC Flocculant dosage can influence flocculation performance. CGG-g-PAM3 which has middle molecular weight of 5.95 million has been applied to dispose waste water. The results are showed in Figs. 5\u20137 . Fig. 5 shows that percentage of turbidity removal (%) is not high at PAC 60 ppm. It reaches 97% when PAC is beyond 120 ppm and the dosage of CGG-g-PAM is about 0.9 ppm. The percentage keeps stable with further enhancement of CGG-g-PAM. So this copolymer will be used with inorganic coagulant with high-turbidity removal effect. From Fig. 6 it is clear that the dosage of CGG-g-PAM has definite impact on percentage of COD removal (%). It gradually increases with the dosage of CGG-g-PAM (<3.6 ppm) increasing. However percentage of COD removal (%) slightly decreases with further enhancement of the dosage of CGG-g-PAM (beyond 3.6 ppm). Percentage of COD and turbidity removal (%) reaches maximum of 24% and 98% correspondingly when the dosage of PAC and CGG-g-PAM are 120 ppm and 3.6 ppm, respectively. The big floc is observed due to bridging of copolymer molecule between suspended particles. 3.2.2 Effect of pH value The pH has a weak effect on the flocculation efficiency. Fig. 7 indicates that percentage of turbidity removal (%) is above 95% when pH ranging from 3 to 9. But percentage of COD removal (%) is the highest of 24% at pH 5. Thus it is concluded that flocculation effect of CGG-g-PAM is better under acidic and neutral media. 3.2.3 Flocculation effect of different molecular weight of CGG-g-PAM It can be seen from Table 3 that percentage of turbidity and COD removal (%) increases slightly with increasing of molecular weight. CGG-g-PAM is a kind of linear polymer which behaves as bridge between contaminant substrates. For effective bridging to occur, the length of polymer chain should be long enough to assure powerful bridging. Hence copolymer whose molecular weight is 2.52 \u00d7 10 6 can easily achieve effective flocculation due to the long PAM chain. Further increasing of M w can improve the removal ratio slightly as the particles in the wastewater is limited. 3.2.4 Comparison of flocculation effect of CGG and CPAM Table 4 shows that percentage of turbidity and COD removal (%) treated with CGG-g-PAM are higher than that with CGG and CPAM under the same conditions. Thus CGG-g-PAM is more effective than CGG and CPAM due to the long polyacrylamide chain grafted on the backbone. The positive charge density is less than that of CGG because mass ratio of AM:CGG is large (see Table 1 ). Therefore it is bridging not charge neutralization that plays a role in suspensions removal. 4 Conclusions From the FTIR, DTG and SEM study it can be concluded the grafting of PAM on CGG was occurred successfully. An effective flocculating agent can be developed for the treatment of tobacco wastewater. The copolymer should be utilized together with inorganic coagulant PAC. The optimum dosage of PAC and CGG-g-PAM are 120 ppm and 3.6 ppm, respectively at pH 5. The percentage of turbidity and COD removal are 98% and 24% correspondingly and sedimentation of floc is good. The flocculation efficiency is increased slightly with enhancement of molecular weight. CGG-g-PAM copolymer can remove the suspended contaminant more efficiently than ungrafted CGG and CPAM at low dosage for wide pH range. References [1] R. Kumar M. Tripathi K.

The activation energy of the solid-state process was determined to be 214 kJ/mol using Kissinger's method, which does not require knowledge of the reaction mechanism. The value of the activation energy obtained using Flynn\u2013Wall\u2013Ozawa method was in agreement with that using Kissinger's method. Different reaction mechanisms were used to compare with this value. Also the experimental data were compared to master curves. Analysis of the experimental results suggested that the actual reaction mechanism was a D n deceleration type.",

        "abstract": "Stimuli-responsive smart polymers have been studied extensively. In this work, thermoresponsive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide-N-methylolacrylamide-acrylamide) (PNIPAm-NMA-Am) was successfully synthesised via radical polymerisation, as confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. PNIPAm-NMA-Am was electrospun into nano\ufb01bres, allowing its use as a drug carrier after simple thermal treatment. Thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy results also revealed that the as-prepared PNIPAm-NMA-Am nanofibres have a uniform small diameter, good thermal stability and excellent integrity in aqueous environments. Additionally, the properties of this PNIPAm-NMA-Am nanofibres were tunable with temperature changes below and above the lower critical solution temperature of 48\u202f\u00b0C. The drug release properties of PNIPAm-NMA-Am10 nanofibres as a drug carrier were studied via ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and the results showed that 80% of the drug was released from the nanofibres after six heating and cooling (60-10\u202f\u00b0C) cycles within 60\u202fmin. Only a small amount of the drug was released during the cooling process, which directly demonstrates \"on-off\" functionality of PNIPAm-NMA-Am nanofibres for controlled drug release. Finally, cell culture studies indicated that the PNIPAm-NMA-Am nano\ufb01bres have not cytotoxicity. Thus, the novel PNIPAm-NMA-Am nanofibres show great potential in the biomedical \ufb01eld as drug carriers.",

Coaxial electrospraying equipment and nonsolvent precipitating bath were used to produce hollow micro-spheres in one step. The properties of the core solution affected the formation of hollow PES microspheres. To form hollow microspheres in one step, the core solution should be removed directly by a nonsolvent. Additionally, the core solution should also be used to occupy the internal space of microspheres and form a supporting layer at the interface between the core solution and the shell solution. The supporting layer formed by the micro-phase that was caused by the phase separation of the core or shell solution was the key factor for the formation of hollow PES microspheres. The performance of hollow microspheres produced by this method was excellent. This method provided a new simple way to form hollow polymer microspheres and can be extended to other polymers to prepare hollow microspheres in one step. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2012.",

The porous PES microspheres can remove bisphenol A (BPA) from its aqueous solution effectively. Compared with collapsed microspheres, the rough microspheres had much higher specific surface area and better mobility in the BPA aqueous solution, so it showed a better adsorption capacity than that of collapsed microspheres.

        "title": "Thermal cross-link behavior of an amorphous poly (para-arylene sulfide sulfone amide)",
        "abstract": "Cross-link behavior of an amorphous poly (para-arylene sulfide sulfone amide) synthesized via low temperature solution polycondensation was observed for the first time, when the polymer was subject to a series of thermal curing at 260 \u00b0C in air condition. The formation of cross-link network was demonstrated by the DSC and TGA results that T g of the polymer enhanced from 259.17 \u00b0C to 268.89 \u00b0C, and the 1% weight loss temperature increased remarkably from 243.75 \u00b0C to 345.87 \u00b0C. EPR analysis further suggested that two kinds of free radicals, CO and C , induced by thermal curing were responsible for this cross-link behavior. According to FT-IR spectrum, the origin of these free radicals was confirmed as amide C O group in the polymer backbone. The cross-linking type was attributed to conventional radical cross-link reaction and the cross-link mechanism was discussed in detail subsequently. Graphical abstract Keywords Poly (para-arylene sulfide sulfone amide) Thermal curing Cross-link behavior 1 Introduction Poly (phenylene sulfide) (PPS) is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic engineering polymer, which has attracted much attention from researchers due to its excellent mechanical properties, good solvent resistance, high temperature resistance and so on [1\u201310] . As a structurally modified material of PPS, an amorphous poly (arylene sulfide sulfone amide) (PASSA) was synthesized via low temperature solution polycondensation in our laboratory [11] . It possesses the desirable dimensional stability and chemical resistance of PPS as well as the high strength of polyamide (PA); in addition, it has higher glass-transition temperature than PPS which makes up for the disadvantage of PPS. PASSA is soluble in some polar solvents due to its improved solubility compared to PPS, such as N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF), but it still has much higher chemical resistance than PA. The superior characteristics of PASSA make it valuable and potentially applicable in polymer electrolyte membranes, composite bipolar plates, conductive materials, surface mounted devices, vehicle sensors and so on [12\u201315] . Thermal behavior is one of the most significant characteristics of polymers due to its crucial influence in application. So it is of great importance to understand the changes in chemical structures and physical properties, which may occur during thermal histories. In recent years, a large number of experimental data have established the thermal properties of PPS [16\u201319] . Gies et\u00a0al. [20] reported that PPS thermal curing in the presence of oxygen leaded to oxygen uptake in the form of sulfoxides in the PPS backbone. Perng [21] researched the mechanism and kinetic model for thermal decomposition behavior of PPS by stepwise pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and thermogravimetry analysis/mass spectrometry techniques. However, there were few literatures that discussed the thermal properties of amorphous structurally modified materials of PPS. Wang [22] studied the thermal degradation of poly (phenylene sulfide sulfone) (PPSS) by thermogravimetric analysis, and suggested the reaction mechanism was a Dn deceleration type. It is not yet clear about the thermal behavior before degradation of these amorphous polymers. For the purpose of theoretical research and application, it is necessary to study the thermal properties of this PASSA resin. In our previous work, the effect of annealing treatment on meta-PASSA in nitrogen atmosphere was studied [23] . The result showed that decarboxylation of the terminal carboxylic acid group occurred during the annealing treatment, and annealed m -PASSA exhibited different thermal properties compared to the untreated one. However, no cross-link behavior of the polymer was discovered in this work. In the recent study, we present experimental results on thermal curing of para-PASSA in air condition. Our aim is to learn the thermal property of this polymer and the changes of chain structure in different thermal histories. Thermal cross-link behavior of the polymer is demonstrated for the first time via the enhancement of glass-transition temperature and 1% weight loss temperature. Amide C O group in the polymer backbone produces two kinds of free radicals which are responsible for this cross-link behavior, and the reaction mechanism is discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials 4,4\u2032-Dichloro diphenyl sulfone (DCDPS) was supplied by Jinsheng Chemical Reagents Company (Huaian, China). 4-Aminothiophenol was acquired from Shouerfu Chemical Reagent Corporation (Jinyun, China). 1,4-Benzenedicarbonyl chloride was purchased from Lianda Chemical Reagent Corporation (Nanchang, China). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium carbonate (K 2 CO 3 ) were gained from Changlian Chemical Reagent Corporation (Chengdu, China). N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) and anhydrous alcohol were obtained from Kelong Chemical Reagent Corporation (Chengdu, China). N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was provided by Jinlong Chemical Industry Company (Nanjing, China). All the above chemicals were commercial products and used as received. 2.2 Synthesis of p -PASSA The monomer, 4,4\u2032-bis(4-aminophenylthio) diphenyl sulfone, was synthesized using DCDPS via an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction. The typical reaction condition was at 150 \u00b0C in nitrogen atmosphere. The synthesis of para-PASSA was performed following the polycondensation method in a glass batch reactor. The proper amounts of 4,4\u2032-bis(4-aminophenylthio) diphenyl sulfone and appropriate 1,4-benzenedicarbonyl chloride with a molar ratio of 1.01/1.00 were charged into the reaction tube of the polycondensation apparatus. The reaction mixture was dissolved in NMP at freezing temperature remaining for hours [11] . The product was washed repeatedly with hot water and then dried at 120 \u00b0C for 48 h. The synthesis route is shown in Fig.\u00a01 . 2.3 Preparation of the p -PASSA membranes The p -PASSA membranes were prepared by dissolving the polymer powders in NMP, and then casting the solution on microscopy slides directly. The films were subsequently dried in an oven at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h to remove the residual solvent. 2.4 Thermal curing The prepared polymer (powder or membrane) was subject to a series of thermal histories by being heated at 260 \u00b0C for 2 h, 6 h and 10 h, respectively, in air, oxygen and nitrogen environment, followed by the cooling in air until the temperature drops to the indoor one. The samples for ESR measurement should be quenched into ice water after the treatment to freeze the unreacted free radicals. 2.5 Thermal property measurements Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using the NETZSCH DSC 200 PC thermal analysis equipment with polymer powders, fitted with a cooler system using liquid nitrogen. It was operated at a gas rate of 10 ml/min in nitrogen atmosphere. The heating rate of DSC measurement was 10 \u00b0C/min. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted using the TGA Q500 V6.4 Build 193 thermal analysis equipment with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min in nitrogen atmosphere. 2.6 Characterization of the polymer structure and molecular weight Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic measurements were characterized by examining thin, homogeneous membranes in the NEXUS670 FT-IR instrument. Nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) instrument was used to provide the chain structure with a BRUKER-400 NMR Spectrometer. The samples were dissolved in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out with a Philips electronic instrument (X\u2019pert Pro MPD) using Cu\u2013Ka radiation at 40 kV and 150 mA with scanning from 0\u00b0 to 50\u00b0. Molecular weight distributions were measured by conventional gel permeation chromatography (GPC) system equipped with a Waters 515 Isocratic HPLC pump, a Waters 2414 refractive index detector, GPC measurements were carried out at 60 \u00b0C using DMF as eluent with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The system was calibrated with linear polystyrene standards. 2.7 Characterization of free radicals Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) measurements were conducted at 15 \u00b0C on an X-band JEOL JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer, and operated at a 9.4 GHz modulation field with microwave power of 1 mW. When the microwave power saturation method was used, the microwave power was changed from 0.04 mW to 49 mW. The radical concentration was characterized by the ESR spectrum intensity compared to a standard sample of weak pitch. The sample powders or membranes (18.5 \u00b1 0.2 mg) were examined in a quartz cell. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and molecular weight characterization The chemical structures of monomer and polymer were characterized with 1 H NMR and FT-IR spectrometer. 1 H NMR spectra for 4,4\u2032-bis(4-aminophenylthio) diphenyl sulfone (BAPS) is shown in Fig.\u00a02 and details are tabulated in Table 1 . Five groups of peaks appear in the NMR spectrum, and the ratio of corresponding integral curves is 1:1:1:1:1, which implies the symmetric disubstitution of the benzene ring. This structure can also be verified by the representative FT-IR spectrum of the polymer ( Fig.\u00a03 ). The presence of sulfuryl S O stretch in the backbone of the polymer is indicated by absorption at 1313 cm \u22121 and 1155 cm \u22121 [24] , and the broad band in the 3245\u20133341 cm \u22121 region corresponds to the N\u2013H stretch [25,26] . The absorption peaks around 763 cm \u22121 and 827 cm \u22121 are attributed to the C\u2013H out of plane stretch of 1,4-disubstituted benzene, which indicate a linear or 1,4-conjugated phenyl structure. This fact is in agreement with Wang\u2019s work on synthesis of poly (phenylenesulfidephenylenamine) by self-polycondensation of methyl-(4-anilinophenyl) sulfide [27] . The aggregative structure of p -PASSA was determined by the XRD analysis. The presence of strong polar O S O bonds in a repeated unit of the polymer backbone imparts a highly amorphous character to the polymer as is evident from the presence of a broad amorphous diffraction peak ( Fig.\u00a04 ) [28] . The position of a quite wide peak in the range of 15\u201325\u00b0 is taken as a measure of\u00a0the most probable intersegmental spacing [29] , and the narrow peak of p -PASSA after curing compared to the untreated one results from the reduction of distances among molecules. Molecular weight of the polymer was determined by GPC analysis with M n value of 59,565, and M w value of 215,930. 3.2 TGA measurements TG and DTG curves of the polymer, measured in nitrogen, are presented in Fig.\u00a05 and details are listed in Table 2 . The onset degradation temperature is as high as 456.37 \u00b0C, which is a good indication of the polymer thermal stability. The comparison in Table 2 indicates that thermal stability of the polymer is improved after curing. The 1% weight loss temperature rises remarkably from 243.75 \u00b0C to 345.87 \u00b0C, and weight loss at 800 \u00b0C decreases by about 2%. The mass loss is due to the elimination of volatile species from the polymer. The low 1% weight loss temperature of p -PASSA before treatment implies that some volatiles and low molecular weight oligomers are contained in the samples [30] . The enhanced temperature of 1% weight loss and reduced weight loss at 800 \u00b0C after curing suggest that thermal cross-link behavior of the polymer could exist and the oligomers are efficiently incorporated into the cross-linked structure during the treatment process. To identify the existence of cross-link behavior, DSC measurements were employed as described below. 3.3 DSC measurements Fig.\u00a06 represents the DSC curves of p -PASSA samples which were subject to different thermal histories. The endothermic peaks revealed in the scans are attributed to the glass transition of the polymer [23] . In Fig.\u00a06 a, the T g value increases by nearly 4 \u00b0C in the second heating curve. This is indicative of curing and indicating the presence of cross-link structure [31] . After thermal curing at 260 \u00b0C for 10 h in air, the T g value increases from 259.17 \u00b0C to 268.64 \u00b0C ( Fig.\u00a06 b), and the T g values in the first and second heating curves are almost the same. This fact implies that the cross-link structure has already formed. Furthermore, the second sample was put in a vial with \u223c3 mL of NMP. After 1 week, the sample was not dissolved in the solvent. This also illustrates that thermal curing has occurred to a sufficient extent to form the cross-link material. 3.4 EPR measurements EPR analysis is used to identify the generation of free radicals [32] , and confirm the cross-link reaction type. The effect of thermal curing on p -PASSA powders in a time span of 0\u201310 h was studied by using the EPR spectrum. As it can be seen from Fig.\u00a07 , a typical single line shape ( g = 2.0023) is exhibited in the spectrum. R 1 is used hereinafter to represent this kind of free radicals. A comparison of the line feature clearly shows an enhancement of the peaks with the increase of curing time, which indicates a rise of R 1 free radical concentration. The variation of radical concentration with time is shown in Fig.\u00a08 . The curve of concentration versus treatment time can be divided into three stages. The first 3-h is a stage of activating free radicals. In this stage, free radicals have little chance to impact each other, which is caused by their few existences, so the concentration rises with time linearly from 0.007 \u00d7 10 13 spins mg \u22121 to 4.36 \u00d7 10 13 spins mg \u22121 . The radicals increase slightly in the next stage from 3 to 6 h, only from 4.36 \u00d7 10 13 spins mg \u22121 to 6.62 \u00d7 10 13 spins mg \u22121 . It is considered that the free radicals are initiated and consumed via the cross-linking reaction in this stage [33] . The rate of radical generation is only a little above the rate of consumption, which results in the mildly rise of concentration. When the treatment time is above 6 h, the concentration enhances linearly again. It is inferred that a network structure has already formed in this stage, and the free radicals produced are not consumed anymore. This fact corresponds to the DSC result at the same curing temperature. From the line shape in Fig.\u00a07 one can see that the left side of the peak is a little wider than the right one, which is highlighted by an arrow. It is possible that another weak peak (R 2 ) covered by R 1 exists, so the microwave power saturation method is employed to confirm and differentiate them [34] . With the increase of microwave power in Fig.\u00a09 a , R 2 signal appeared gradually, which could be observed in the amplifying signal of 8 mW ( Fig.\u00a09 b). Due to the few number of R 2 free radicals, the R 2 signal is so weak that covered the R 1 signal. Meanwhile, the EPR signal enhanced to maximum at 2 mW, and then weakened gradually. The variations of signal intensities are attributed to the saturated characteristic of R 1 radicals [33] , which is easily saturated by microwave power at a level around 2 mW. The phenomenon that left side of the peak widened with the increase of power could be explained by the existence of R 2 free radicals. As shown in Fig.\u00a010 , the EPR signal is the superposition of R 1 (blue line) and R 2 (red line). When microwave power grows above 2 mW, R 1 signal is saturated and weakens gradually. However, R 2 signal does not saturate with power easily, which increases slightly in the power range ( Fig.\u00a010 b). In conclusion, the different saturated characteristics of R 1 and R 2 are the reason for broadened left side of the peak in EPR signals. The phenomenon that EPR signal enhanced with the increase of thermal curing time suggested that R 1 may be oxygen free radicals because of the treatment environment in air. In order to analyze the origin of these free radicals, a group of contrast experiments were carried out in N 2 , air and O 2 atmosphere, respectively, with a thermal curing at 260 \u00b0C for 10 h. A comparison of the three signals in EPR spectrum ( Fig.\u00a011 a ) clearly shows that the radical concentration produced in N 2 is much lower than that in air, and close to the untreated one, meanwhile O 2 environment induces the highest radical concentration. Fig.\u00a011 b is the amplifying signal of the sample cured in N 2 , from which one can see that the R 1 signal decreased sharply due to the curing environment, and R 2 signal is clearer in this picture (highlighted by an arrow). So it is considered that the production of R 1 and R 2 is closely related to O 2 , and R 1 could be RO free radicals. According to the FT-IR spectrum of the polymer ( Fig.\u00a03 ), an obvious decrease in the amide C O peak at 1644 cm \u22121 after curing is observed, which coincides with our inference. Therefore it can be concluded that the origin of R 1 and R 2 is the amide C O group. Combined with EPR analysis it is reasonable that R 1 are CO free radicals, and R 2 are C free radicals. The cross-linking reaction mechanism is suggested as below. 3.5 Possible reaction mechanism of cross-link Based on the research hereinbefore, the thermal cross-link behavior of p -PASSA could be explained by the following mechanism. The double bonds of amide C O are opened when they are subject to thermal curing in air, and two kinds of free radicals, C \u00a0and CO , are produced consequently. With the effect of O 2 , most C are transformed into CO free radicals, which causes the higher concentration of R 1 than R 2 . The cross-linking network was formed afterward which was induced by these two kinds of free radicals. The cross-linking reaction type belongs to conventional radical cross-link reaction, and the reaction process is shown in Fig.\u00a012 . 4 Conclusions An amorphous p -PASSA was synthesized via low temperature solution polycondensation. The polymer with high glass-transition temperature (259 \u00b0C) and thermal stability suggests a potential use in heat-resistant materials. We have demonstrated, for the first time, the thermal cross-link behavior of the polymer at 260 \u00b0C in air condition. The results showed that the formation of cross-link network enhanced the T g from 259.17 \u00b0C to 268.89 \u00b0C, and the 1% weight loss temperature of the polymer increased remarkably from 243.75 \u00b0C to 345.87 \u00b0C. Two kinds of free radicals, CO and C , existed in the polymer, and concentration of the former was much higher than that of the latter. These two kinds of free radicals were responsible for the intermolecular cross-linking behavior. The cross-linking type was attributed to conventional radical cross-link reaction, and the reaction mechanism was also suggested. This cross-linkable polymer represents a new class of super engineering plastic with great thermal stability. Further investigations regarding the processing and mechanical properties of this material are in active progress and the results will be presented in our future articles.

        "abstract": "In this research study, air plasma-treated polyphenylene sulfide film was used to prepare polyphenylene sulfide/glass fiber cloth composites for improving interfacial adhesion and mechanical properties. The effect of air plasma treatment on the properties of polyphenylene sulfide films was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angle analysis. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, it was found that plasma treatment led to the emergence of oxygen-containing polar groups on the film surface. The intensity of sulfide oxides (S = O and O = S = O) on the surface of polyphenylene sulfide films increased to 79.03% after it was modified by air plasma. Water droplet contact angle analysis indicated that plasma treatment significantly increased the hydrophilicity of the polyphenylene sulfide film. The contact angle was 38 degrees for plasma-treated polyphenylene sulfide film, compared to 78.5 degrees for untreated polyphenylene sulfide film. Tensile strength and notched impact strength of plasma-treated polyphenylene sulfide/glass fiber cloth (50/50) composite increased by 11% (from 248.49 MPa to 275.70 MPa) and 18% (from 52.26 KJ/m2 to 61.43 KJ/m2), respectively, compared with the raw specimen, which was consistent with the morphology analysis result. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties of the composites were improved with the increased discharge power density and treatment time. \u00a9 2013 The Author(s).",

In this article, aramid nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning aramid fibers solution with the addition of lithium chloride (LiCl). It showed a good adsorption capacity when methylene blue (MB) was used as the model target. There were much larger adsorption amounts and faster kinetics of uptaking target species of electrospun aramid nanofibers to MB than that of electrospun polyethersulfone (PES) nanofibers. Compared with activated carbon, aramid nanofibers also have a much faster adsorption rate to MB. Aramid nanofibers were subsequently used to effectively remove endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A (BPA), phenol (Phe), and p-hydroquinone (BPhe) from their aqueous solutions. Additionally, molecule imprinted technology enhances aramid nanofibers with much higher adsorption amounts and special adsorption property for endocrine disruptors. These results showed that aramid nanofibers have the potential to be used in environmental applications. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "This article successfully prepared the red blood cell-shaped microspheres via electrospraying. The polymer solution was comprised of polyether sulfone (PES) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) was added to regulate and control the structure of the microspheres. When the solution concentration was 7.6 wt % and PES/PEG proportion was 10: 5 while preparing microspheres, the shape and diameter of the microspheres was the most similar to that of erythrocyte. The results suggested that the forming mechanism of the red blood cell-shaped microspheres be related to two aspects. One is that the microspheres had relatively weak mechanical strength because of the sponge pores internal nanostructure. The other is that the existence of residual solvents and water within the microspheres would dissolve the gel phase PES and then further weaken mechanical strength of the outer layer of the microspheres, which caused the structural changes on the top layer of the spheres, that is, the top layer collapsed, and the microspheres finally turned into the red blood cell-shaped microspheres. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Two kinds of monomers containing the thioether units 4,4\u2032-thiodibenzoyl chloride (T-DC) and 4,4\u2032-bis(4-chloroformylphenylthio)benzene (BPB-DC) were synthesized in two steps and were reacted with diamine-containing thioether (\u2013S\u2013) and sulfone units to prepare a polyamide containing high contents of thioether groups. The intrinsic viscosities of the polyamides were 0.81\u20130.93 dl/g. These polymers had good optical properties, including an optical transmittance of the aromatic polyamide film at 450 nm that was higher than 90%. Additionally, the high quantity of thioether units provided the polymers with high refractive indices of 1.710\u20131.716 and low birefringences of 0.007\u20130.009. These polyamides also had excellent thermal properties, with glass transition temperatures ( T g ) of 230\u2013246 \u00b0C and initial degradation temperatures ( T d ) of 477\u2013473 \u00b0C. Finally, they showed improved solubility in polar aprotic solvents. Keywords Polyamide Refractive index Birefringence Soluble Thermo-stability 1 Introduction In recent years, there has been a strong demand to develop high refractive index polymers for optical applications, such as encapsulants for organic light-emitting diode devices, components for charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors (CISs), among others [1\u20135] . A high refractive index, optical transparency and low birefringence are the most important factors in optical applications. According to the Lorentz\u2013Lorenz equation, the introduction of substituents with high molar refractions and low-molar volumes can efficiently increase the refractive indices of polymers [6\u201313] . For example, heavy halogen atoms (Cl, Br, I), sulfur atoms and metal atoms are commonly used for this purpose. In particular, the sulfur atom, which has a high atomic refraction, is one of the most effective candidates. To improve the refractive indices and transparencies of polymers, recent attention has been paid to sulfur-containing polymers, such as epoxies [14] , polyurethanes [15] , polymethacrylates [16] , polyarylenethioethers [17] and polyimides [18] . Among them, polyimides (PI) are promising candidates for advanced optical applications. Aromatic polyamides have good thermal and physical properties [19] . Due to their exceptional technological importance, they have attracted considerable efforts at improving their solubility because these polymers usually present limited solubility in most organic solvents. Furthermore, high melting and glass transition temperatures decrease their processability and restrict applications. To overcome these shortcomings, various approaches have been developed to obtain thermally stable, high molecular weight and organic-soluble aromatic polyamides. These techniques include the introduction of bulky pendant groups [20,21] , functional groups [22] , hydrazide groups [23] , non-symmetric groups [24,25] , hexafluoro isopropyl groups [26] and flexible chains such as ethers ( O ) or ester groups ( COO ) into the polymer backbone. The chemical structure of aromatic polyamides is similar to PI, but PI has a more rigid structure than polyamide, leading to a higher birefringence. Thus, we aimed to prepare polyamides with high refractive indices, but with much lower birefringences than PI. Usually, the transmittance of a polymer film is decreased when a high content of thioether units are incorporated into the polymer chain. Therefore, we introduced a diamine-containing sulfone group into the polycondensation reaction to improve the polymer\u2019s transmittance. Herein, we report the synthesis of two types of dibenzoyl chloride-containing thioether units. Polycondensation reactions of these dibenzoyl chlorides and diamine monomers containing sulfones and a high content of thioether groups were conducted in the presence Me 3 SiCl (TMSCl) as a catalyst. The resultant polyamides were found to have high refractive indices and low birefringences, while maintaining excellent optical transparencies. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Commercially available 1,4-chlorobenzene (DCB) (AR, Chengdu, Kelong Chemical Industry Company), 4,4\u2032-dichlorodiphenylsulfone (DCDPS) (AR, Suzhou Yinsheng Chemical Industry Company), 4-aminobenzenthiol and 4,4\u2032-thiodianiline (AR, Zhe Jiang Shou Er Fu Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd.), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (AR, SiChuan ChengDu ChangLian Chemical Reagent Company), sodium sulfide (Na 2 S\u00b7 x H 2 O, Na 2 S% \u2248 60%) (Nafine Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd.), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (JiangSu NanJing JinLong Chemical Industry Company) and Me 3 SiCl (TMSCl) (AR, Aladdin Reagent Company) were used without further purification. 4-Fluorobenzoic acid (4-FBA) was made in our laboratory, while sodium benzoate, sodium 4-methylbenzenesulfonate (AR, Aladdin Reagent Company) and other reagents and solvents were commercially obtained. 2.2 Monomer synthesis 2.2.1 4,4\u2032-bis(4-aminophenylthio)diphenylsulfone (BAPDS) (shown as Scheme 1 ) [27] BAPDS was prepared as shown in Scheme 1 with the following procedure.

The mixture was stirred at 155 \u00b0C for 24 h under nitrogen, as shown in Scheme 1 . The crude product was then purified with water and methanol. The resulting material was recrystallized from a mixture of water and DMF to provide BAPDS as a pale yellow crystalline powder. Yield: 33.5 g, 72.3%. m/z(M + ): 465.27.

The reactor was heated to 180 \u00b0C for 35 min and kept for 2 h; during this time, 45.8 ml of liquid was removed. When the above reaction vessel was cooled to 130 \u00b0C, 100 ml of NMP containing 14 g (0.1 mol) of 4-FBA was added into the reactor dropwise over 3 h and kept at 125 \u00b0C for 6 h to prepare 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (the solution color changed from blue to pale-yellow). Then, 14 g (0.095 mol) of DCB was added into the reaction solution, and the reaction flask was heated to 200 \u00b0C and maintained for 8 h. The reaction solution was then poured into deionized water and filtered. The filter liquor was acidified with 1 mol/L HCl to precipitate a cottony crude product under stirring. The crude product was then washed several times with hot water to remove possible residual salts. Next, the purified product was filtered, dissolved in a solution of NaHCO 3 , filtered, acidified with hydrochloric acid and then filtered again. This process was repeated three times.

The number-average molecular weights ( M n ) and weight-average molecular weight ( M w ) were obtained via GPC performed with a Waters 1515 performance liquid chromatography pump, a Waters 2414 differential refractometer (Waters Co., Milford, MA) and a combination of Styragel HT-3 and HT-4 columns (Waters Co., Milford, MA), the effective molecular weight ranges of which were 100\u201310,000, 500\u201330,000 and 5000\u2013800,000, respectively. N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) was used as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 35 \u00b0C. Polystyrene standards were used for calibration. The samples of monomer and PA-(a\u2013b) were measured with an elemental analyzer (EURO EA-3000). FT-IR spectroscopic measurements were performed on a NEXUS670 FT-IR instrument.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a NETZSCH DSC 200 PC thermal analysis instrument. The heating rate for the DSC measurements was 10 \u00b0C/min. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a TGA Q500 V6.4 Build 193 thermal analysis instrument with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. An Instron Corporation 4302 was used to study the stress\u2013strain behavior of the films. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) was performed on TA-Q800 apparatus operating in tensile mode at a frequency of 1 Hz in the temperature range from 30 to 300 \u00b0C, with a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min. The transmittance of the films was determined by UV\u2013Visible spectroscopy (U-200A). The out-of-plane ( n TM ) and in-plane ( n TE ) refractive indices of the PA films were measured with a SPA-Lite prism coupler (SPA-4000) equipped with a He Ne laser light source (wavelength: 632.8 nm). The in-plane ( n TE )/out-of-plane ( n TM ) indices and birefringences (\u0394 n ) were calculated with the following equation: \u0394 n = n TE \u2212 n TM . The average refractive index was calculated according to the following equation: n AV = ( 2 n TE 2 + n TM 2 ) / 3 1 / 2 [30] . Dielectric constants were estimated from the optical data based on an empirical relation: \u03b5 calculated = 1.1 n AV 2 [31,32] . The water absorption of the samples was measured according to GB/T17037.3-2003. Dielectric constants were measured on a TH2819A in a frequency region of 0.1\u2013100 kHz at 25 \u00b0C. The solubility of polymers in various solvents was tested at room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Monomers 3.1.1 Synthesis of BPB-DC and T-DC The synthetic routes to BPB-DC are shown in Scheme 1 . BPB-DC was prepared through a three-step procedure with 4-FBA and DCB. Sodium benzoate and sodium 4-methylbenzenesulfonate were added into the reaction system to assist with the dissolution of sodium sulfide and the product. First, 4-FBA reacted with sodium sulfide to provide 4-mercaptobenzoic acid salt [33\u201335] , which reacted with DCB under nitrogen to give BPB-DA. Then, BPB-DA was converted to BPB-DC through reaction with SOCl 2 . This procedure must be anhydrous or the yield is very low. T-DC was prepared in a similar way to BPB-DC. 3.1.2 Characterization of BPB-DA, BPB-DC, T-DA and T-DC The chemical structure of the monomers was confirmed by FT-IR and 1 H NMR. The FT-IR spectra of BPB-DA and T-DA showed the characteristic absorptions of COOH near 1700 cm \u22121 , and the absorption of S near 1080 cm \u22121 . The 1 H NMR spectra ( Fig. 1 ) of BPB-DA and T-DA showed four and three groups of peaks. The proton signals of COOH (see Supplementary data Fig. 1 ) were present obviously at high frequency area (12.97 ppm). The FT-IR spectra of BPB-DC and T-DC showed the characteristic absorptions of COCl near 1760 and 1720 cm \u22121 , and the absorption of S near 1080 cm \u22121 . The 1 H NMR spectra (see Supplementary data Fig. 2 ) of BPB-DC showed three groups of peaks (ranged from 7.28 to 8.02). The ratio of the corresponding integral curves was about 1:1:1. The 1 H NMR spectra (see Supplementary data Fig. 2 ) of T-DC showed two groups of peaks. The ratio of the corresponding integral curves was also about 1:1. Combining the results of the FT-IR and mass spectral analyses suggested that we had prepared the monomer as depicted in Scheme 1 . 3.2 Polymers 3.2.1 Synthesis of polyamides (PA-(a\u2013b)) The polycondensation reaction of the diamine (BAPDS) and BPB-DC was conducted in the presence of TMSCl as a catalyst in NMP. Silylation of the diamine is an efficient activation method to obtain higher molecular weight polymers. According to the literature, the diamine component can be activated through the in situ addition of TMSCl to the diamine solution [36\u201339] . Due to the strong affinity of Si for oxygen, the carbonyl oxygen of the acid chloride is attracted to the Si atom in the amine derivatives, which in turn facilitates nucleophilic attack of the N atom of the N-silylated amine at the carbonyl carbon. Subsequent elimination of the chloride ion from the tetrahedral intermediate is enhanced by the presence of the \u03b2-silicon through the \u03c3 \u2013 \u03c0 effect, which rapidly leads to the amide product along with TMSCl. Another important aspect of using TMSCl is that it scavenges adventitious water. 3.2.2 The intrinsic viscosity ( \u03b7 int ) and molecular weights of PA-(a\u2013b) and PA-(A\u2013B) The molecular weights of the polyamides were measured by \u03b7 int and GPC. In order to investigate the role of the catalyst we also studied the polyamides (PA-(A\u2013B)) without adding the catalyst (TMSCl) during the polymerization process. As shown in Table 1 , the \u03b7 int values of PA-(a\u2013b) and PA-(A\u2013B) were in the range of 0.81\u20130.93 dL/g and 0.56\u20130.60 dL/g, respectively. PA-(a\u2013b) showed M n values in the range of 8.0\u201310.5 \u00d7 10 4 and M w values in the range of 1.38\u20131.78 \u00d7 10 5 , respectively. The polydispersity indices (PDIs) of PA-(a\u2013b) were 1.72 and 1.70, respectively. While PA-(A\u2013B) showed M n values in the range of 3.2\u20134.1 \u00d7 10 4 and M w values in the range of 6.1\u20137.4 \u00d7 10 4 , respectively. The polydispersity indices (PDIs) of PA-(A\u2013B) were 1.91 and 1.80, respectively. The results indicate that the catalyst plays an important role in the polymerization reaction although the changes of the molecular weight are not very large. 3.2.3 The FT-IR and 1 H NMR spectra of PA-(a\u2013b) The FT-IR spectra of PA-(a\u2013b) showed characteristic absorptions of the amide group ( CONH ) near 3300 and 1650 cm \u22121 , of the sulfone group ( SO 2 ) near 1320 cm \u22121 and 1150 cm \u22121 and the S group near 1080 cm \u22121 . In comparison with the monomers (BPB-DC, T-DC), the absorptions of COCl (1760 and 1720 cm \u22121 ) disappeared. This finding suggests that the polymers were prepared as shown in Scheme 1 . Fig. 1 shows the 1 H NMR spectra of PA-a. Eight groups of peaks appeared in the 1 H NMR spectra of PA-a. The signal at 10.49 ppm was assigned to the amide group. The aromatic protons were observed at about 7.18\u20137.94 ppm. The ratio of corresponding integral curves was H b :H c :H f :H g :H d :H h :H e :H a = 2:2:2:2:2:2:2:1. In combination with the FT-IR results, these eight groups of peaks were ascribed to H b , H c , H f , H g , H d , H h , H e and H a , as shown in Fig. 1 . The structure of the polymer was also confirmed by elemental analysis. The structure of PA-b was confirmed through the same series of experiments. 3.2.4 Thermal properties of the polyamides (PA-(a\u2013b) and PA-(A\u2013B)) The thermal properties of PA-(a\u2013b) and PA-(A\u2013B) were examined by DSC and TG analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 , the T g values of PA-(a\u2013b) and PA-(A\u2013B) were 230\u2013246 \u00b0C and 228\u2013244 \u00b0C, respectively (in Table 1 ). It may be that lower molecular weight of PA-(A\u2013B) caused PA-(A\u2013B) had lower glass transition temperature than PA-(a\u2013b). The DSC curve of PA-(a\u2013b) and PA-(A\u2013B) did not have an endothermic melting peak, revealing that PA-(a\u2013b) and PA-(A\u2013B) were amorphous. As shown in Fig. 3 , the initial degradation temperatures ( T 5% ) of PA-(a\u2013b) and PA-(A\u2013B) in nitrogen were 477\u2013473 \u00b0C and 477\u2013472 \u00b0C, respectively. PA-(a\u2013b) and PA-(A\u2013B) provided about 42% char yield at 800 \u00b0C (in Table 1 ). The TGA data indicated that these polymers had improved thermo-stability. 3.2.5 Tensile properties The average tensile strengths of the casting films of the polyamides (PA-(a\u2013b)) treated at 120\u2013140 \u00b0C for 10 h, and then at 180 \u00b0C for 10 h, are given in Table 2 . As shown, the average tensile strengths and the Young\u2019s modulus values of the films PA-(a\u2013b) were 76.3\u201389.8 MPa and 2.7\u20132.1 GPa, respectively. The elongation at break was less than 5%, suggesting that the films undergo brittle fracture. 3.2.6 Dynamic mechanical analysis DMA was used to characterize the obtained polyamides. Fig. 4 shows the storage modulus curves of PA-(a\u2013b). As listed in Table 2 , PA-(a\u2013b) showed a high storage module beyond 1 GPa and 0.8 GPa at 220 \u00b0C. This finding indicates that these polyamides had excellent mechanical properties. At the same time, an obvious transition behavior was observed. It is well known that the glass transition temperature ( T g ) of polymers can be determined by this relaxation ( \u03b1 relaxation), since it is usually related to the segment movements in the non-crystalline areas [40,41] . The temperatures of \u03b1 relaxation of these polyamides were 225 and 248 \u00b0C (these results were nearly to the DSC data). The glass transition temperature decreased upon increasing the amount of flexible chain (thioether) in the polymeric backbone. 3.2.7 Water absorption The water absorption of PA-(a\u2013b) was measured according to GB/T17037.3-2003, and the results are summarized in Table 3 . The water absorptions of PA-(a\u2013b) were 0.19% and 0.21%. These results indicate that these polyamides had low water absorption, which is good for their dimensional and mechanical stability. 3.2.8 Dielectric constants Table 3 summarizes the dielectric constants of PA-(a\u2013b). They showed low dielectric constants of 3.12\u20133.16 at 100 kHz. These low dielectric constants may be attributed to the presence of low polarizability in the molecular structure and low water absorption. 3.2.9 Optical properties Fig. 5 shows the optical transmission spectra of PA-(a\u2013b). The cut-off wavelengths ( \u03bb cutoff ) of the PA-a and PA-b films were 364 and 359 nm, respectively. The spectral shapes of PA-(a\u2013b) were similar to each other, and the transmittances of the films measured at 450 nm were much higher than 90% (film thicknesses: 11\u201312 \u03bcm). However, the transmittances (at 450 nm) of the polyamides that had no sulfone groups (PA-s: the polymer of BPB-DC and 4,4\u2032-thiodianiline) were about 49.9% (shown in Fig. 5 ). This finding indicates that incorporating the sulfone group into the polymer chain is beneficial for improving the optical transparency of the polymer film. The optical properties of the PA films, such as the cut-off wavelengths, in-plane ( n TE ) and out-of-plane ( n TM ) refractive indices, average refractive indices ( n av ) and birefringences (\u0394 n ) are listed in Table 4 . The in-plane ( n TE ) and out-of-plane ( n TM ) refractive indices of PA-(a\u2013b) were in the range of 1.718\u20131.713 and 1.713\u20131.704, respectively. The n av values of PA-(a\u2013b) measured at 632.8 nm were 1.716 and 1.710. The n av depended on several factors, such as sulfur content, molecular chain flexibility and molar volume. PA-a exhibited a higher refractive index than did PA-b. This finding was mainly attributed to its higher sulfur content compared to PA-b. Although the refractive indices were not much higher than that of aromatic PI, which has a similar sulfur content [42] , PA-(a\u2013b) showed low \u0394 n values of 0.007 and 0.009. The highly refractive index and low \u0394 n value of PA-(a\u2013b) can be attributed to the high content of flexible S linkages in the main chain. The \u03b5 calculated values of PA-a and PA-b were 3.24 and 3.22, respectively, which are close to the measured results (shown in Table 3 ). 3.2.10 Solubility experiments The solubility experiments show that the polyamides (PA-(a\u2013b)) had better solubility in polar aprotic solvents. They were soluble in NMP, DMF, DMAc, DMSO and concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature and showed no tendency to precipitate. Thus, they may be processed using more methods, such as electro-spinning and solution casting. However, the polymers were not soluble in hydrochloric acid (6 mol/L), formic acid, toluene or 1,4-dioxane. In comparison to alkyl-polyamide, these polymers showed better corrosion resistance. 4 Conclusions In this article, polyamides containing high contents of thioether groups were prepared through a polycondensation reaction. Incorporation of the sulfone group in the main chain of the polymer is beneficial for the transmittance of polymer films. As expected, the polyamides showed relatively high refractive indices and low birefringences. The refractive index of the polymer was enhanced upon increasing the content of thioether units in the polymer backbone. In contrast, the birefringence decreased with increasing thioether content. The polymers showed low dielectric constants, and good thermal, mechanical and solubility properties. All of these attributes make them good candidates for components in advanced materials, particularly optical devices.

The strong interaction between layered nanoclay and rigid SiO2 is obtained by their different response to shear flow in PPS melt processing. As a result, the exfoliation structure of nanoclay and well-dispersed nano-SiO2 are realized simultaneously. With this successful morphology control, the reinforcement effect of nanofillers in PPS is improved with very little addition. Moreover, with the restriction of exfoliated clay and nano-SiO2 particles, the mobility of PPS molecular chains is confined, leading to the significant change in crystalline behaviors of PPS. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "title": "Porous ultrafine fibers via a salt-induced electrospinning method",
        "abstract": "A salt-induced electrospinning method to produce porous polymer ultrafine fibers was reported in this work. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometer, and BET surface area measurement were employed to evaluate the morphology, the element distribution, and the surface area of fibers, respectively. According to the investigation result, pores on the fiber were induced by water-soluble salt during electrospinning process in a humid spinning environment. There was no porous structure on the fiber surface when water-insoluble salt was used in a wet electrospinning environment or when water-soluble salt was used in a dry electrospinning environment. Compared with pure fibers, the average surface area of fibers containing salt increased significantly due to the porous structure. The possible mechanism of the porous structure induced by salt was proposed. Water-solubility salt and humid environment were considered as the key roles in the formation of porous structure. This method provided a new way to form porous structure during electrospinning. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2012.",

They were synthesized through the reaction of 4,4-bis(4-chloroformylphenylthio)benzene (BPB-DC) and aliphatic diamine by the method of interfacial polycondensation. These polyamides had excellent thermal properties with glass transition temperatures (T g) of 124-137.9\u00b0C, melting temperatures (T m) of 306.4-324.1\u00b0C and initial degradation temperatures (T d) of 409.5-437\u00b0C. They had wider processing windows than traditional semi-aromatic polyamides and can be processed by the melting method. They had better tensile strengths of 61.2-73.7 MPa, low-temperature mechanical properties, low water absorption of 0.17%-0.23%, low dielectric constants of 3.47-3.66 at 100 kHz and better melt flowability properties of 37.3 to 164.4 Pa. s, 48.2 to 281.7 Pa. s and 58.3 to 486.7 Pa. s at different shear rates, respectively. Additionally, these polyamides showed good corrosion resistance, they did not dissolve in solvents such as NMP, DMSO, hydrochloric acid (6 mol/L), H 3PO 4 and solution of NaOH (1 mol/L) etc. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Based on the SAXS and WAXD results, the crystal structure of PPS is not destroyed in stretching due to its higher T g. However, the maximum stress value of thermal curing sample is higher than that of mould temperature control sample, though the contribution of crystal phases are the same since their same crystallinity and grain size. The result indicates that the stress of PPS is not only decided by crystal phase (crystallinity) but amorphous phase: the crystal structures carry most part of the stress in stretching process, and the restricted amorphous chains could also carry partial tensile stress. Correlating the possible structure change with mechanical property, it is reasonable to believe higher entanglement density of molecular chains in amorphous phase could lead to more restricted chains, thus giving a higher stress value to thermal curing sample. The theoretical model is proposed to explain the correspondence between micro-structure and macroscopical performance. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

        "abstract": "In this article, a new large-scale aligned fiber mats formation method called salt-induced pulse electrospinning was developed. By electrospinning salted solution in a humid environment, traditional continuous electrospinning changed into pulse electrospinning and aligned fibers were thus formed. The possible mechanisms for the occurrence of salt-induced pulse electrospinning and the formation of fiber alignment were studied. The continuous electrospinning changing into the pulse electrospinning was due to the change of viscosity and conductivity of salted polymer solution in a wet electrospinning condition. Fishing net-shaped whipping region of the electrospinning jet during pulse electrospinning process was considered as the key factor for the formation of fiber alignment. The mechanical properties of the aligned fiber mat increased significantly compared with that of the random fiber mat. This aligned fiber preparation method only requires a very low rotating drum speed as the receiver and can produce large-scale aligned fiber mats for many applications. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part B: Polym Phys, 2012 Aligned electrospun polymer fibers can be used as filtration membranes, directional optical components, and tissue scaffolds, but the method of alignment can limit any practical applications due to an inability to produce mats of usable size. In this work, a new aligned fiber formation method via salt-induced pulse electrospinning is reported. By electrospinning a salted solution in a humid environment, the traditionally continuous electrospinning process changed into a pulsed process.

        "abstract": "The processing characteristic of polypropylene/hemp fiber composite, at various melt-compounding temperatures between 180 and 230\u00b0C, was characterized by torque rheometry. Hemp fibers were extracted from polypropylene/hemp fibers composites (melt-compounded at 180, 200, and 230\u00b0C, respectively), in a Soxhlet extractor with xylene. The length distribution, aspect ratio distribution, and the diameter of hemp fibers were measured, and the relationship between fiber dimensions and the processing temperature was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction were employed to characterize the changes in fiber morphology and microstructure after melt-compounding. Fiber dimensions statistical results show that fiber length and aspect ratio distribution become narrow and shift to short average values as the processing temperature is raised. In addition, elevated processing temperature induces a remarkable decrease of fiber average diameter. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction results reveal that heat and shear forces applied to hemp fibers cause the reduction of cellulose relative content and the formation of amorphous components. When the processing temperature is higher than 200\u00b0C, irregular fracture morphology of hemp fibers and remarkable decrease in fiber average diameter indicate that hemp fibers' amorphous components, such as hemicellulose and lignin, undergo apparent decomposition at higher processing temperature. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",

The nanocomposite of PPS/CaCO3 can be prepared by melt mixing process. The dispersion of the CaCO3 nanoparticles in PPS was good when filler content below 5\u00a0wt\u2009%. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and small-angle light\n scattering (SALS) results indicated that the CaCO3 nanoparticles could induce the nucleation but retard the mobility of polymer chains. The results of mechanical tests showed\n that a small amount of nanoparticles has resulted in a slight improvement in the tensile strength and a significantly 300%\n increase in the fracture toughness. We believe that the CaCO3 nanoparticles can act as stress concentration sites, which can promote cavitation at the particles boundaries during loading.\n The cavitation can trigger mass plastic deformation of the matrix, leading to much improve fracture toughness. \n ",

A novel homemade apparatus which is operated simply was employed and a different microsample preparation method was introduced. Comparative tests at various loading speeds were made to investigate the influence of testing rate on the interfacial shear strength of CF/PPS micro-composite. It was found that the interfacial shear strength increased with increasing fiber embedded length at speeds below 0.02 mm/s and above 0.04 mm/s, but it was constant between 0.02 and 0.04 mm/s. It is recommended to perform the microbond test in the test rate range of 0.02-0.04 mm/s, where the interfacial shear strength does not change with the embedded length and no significant deviations are observed, thus could better reflect the true interface strength of the composite. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The surface and the internal structures of PES/PEG ultrafine fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the result showed that they were both porous. The porous electrospun PES/PEG ultrafine fibers can remove endocrine disrupters such as biphenyl A (BPA) and biphenyl (BP) effectively. Compared with pure PES ultrafine fibers, PES/PEG ultrafine fibers showed larger adsorption capacity and faster kinetics of uptaking target species. The hydrophilic properties and the porosity of porous PES/PEG ultrafine fibers can be controlled by adding hydrophilic materials such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which can improve the adsorption properties of porous PES/PEG ultrafine fibers significantly. The results showed that porous electrospun PES/PEG ultrafine fibers had the potential to be used in environmental application and water treatment. \u00a9 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

The activation energy of the solid state process was determined using Kissinger's method, which does not require knowledge of the reaction mechanism (RM), to be 174.18 kJ/mol which was lower than that for pure PASS (E = 214 kJ/mol). The study of master curves together with interpretation of integral methods, allows confirmation that the thermal degradation mechanism for PASS in the crystal solvate system is a decelerated Rn type, which is a solid-state process based on a phase boundary controlled reaction, in the conversion range considered. Whereas, the pure PASS follows a decelerated D n thermodegradation mechanism in the same conversion range.",

        "abstract": "The stability of superhydrophobicity is crucial for the long-term application of an oil/water separation membrane in harsh environments such as high temperatures and various aggressive solvents. However, achieving such a stable superhydrophobic membrane remains a challenge. In this study, high performance fibrous oil/water separation membranes with a highly stable superhydrophobicity were fabricated by designing a functional polymer containing hydroxyl units. The reaction of hydroxy groups in poly(arylene ether sulfone) with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) produces stable covalent interactions, which greatly enhance the stability of OTS on the PAES-OH (polyarylene ether sulfone containing hydroxy units) fibrous membrane fabricated by electrospinning, thus improving the stability of superhydrophobicity of the membrane. The stability of the OTS layer was characterized by FT-IR, SEM and water contact angle measurement. The results suggest that OTS is highly stable on a PAES-OH membrane, while OTS on a polyethersulfone (PES) fibrous membrane is detached from the fiber during ultrasonic cleaning. The obtained membrane is superhydrophobic, with a water contact angle (CA) as high as 159.2\u00b0 and a threshold sliding angle (TSA) as low as 7.8\u00b0 even after ultrasonic cleaning for 3 h. In addition, the oil/water separation experiments indicate that this membrane has an excellent performance in the separation of oil from oil/water mixtures, and oil/water emulsions: the gravity driven flux is 7260-8720 L (m2 h)-1 and the water rejection is over 99%. This study provides a new approach for fabricating oil/water separation membranes with highly stable superhydrophobic properties from the perspective of designing new polymers.",

The electrosprayed porous PES microspheres can remove biphenyl A and biphenyl effectively. At the same time, they showed larger adsorption capacity and fast kinetics of uptaking target species than PES injected spheres reported in the earlier publications. The hydrophilicity and porosity of electrosprayed microspheres can be controlled by changing the amount of hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG), which influences the adsorption properties of the microspheres.

        "abstract": "Polymeric porous ultrafine fibers with different structures as drug carrier could be facilely prepared. However, the drug release characteristics and relevant mechanism of different structural porous ultrafine fibers were not well studied. In the present work, different structural polyethersulfone (PES) based porous ultrafine fibers, namely PES, PES/Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and PES/Water were prepared by electrospinning. Curcumin was chosen as drug model loaded in these fibers. Investigation of curcumin release characteristics was carried out by the total immersion in buffer solution. The surface and inner structure of PES based ultrafine fibers were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in detail. It is found that there is significant difference in the accumulate release amount and release rate with similar structure. About 92.5% of curcumin released within 600\u2009min for PES/PEG ultrafine fibers and only 58.9% of curcumin flowed out from PES with 1000\u2009min. In order to discuss the fact of this phenomenon, the development structure of PES based porous ultrafine fibers was studied with curcumin release. The results indicated that the curcumin release was directly involved with the structure. For PES/PEG, curcumin around the surface layer released in advance. And then, some penetrable structure emerged with PEG dissolving in the buffer solution, which result in larger specific surface area and more embedded curcumin from the interior structure of the ultrafine fibers diffusing out. For the others, curcumin release only through its own pores of ultrafine fibers. Finally, the processing-structure-performance relationship of PES based porous ultrafine fibers were confirmed by the diversity of porosity and contact angle. The research results demonstrate that PES based porous ultrafine fibers have the potential to be used as drug carrier in the drug delivery according to the practical clinical requirements.",

The plasma-treated PPS samples were bonded with epoxy adhesive, and the adhesion strength was measured by the single lap-joint specimen test. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were applied to investigate the effect of the plasma treatment on the PPS surface property. A slight etching trace was detected after the plasma treatment according to the SEM images. XPS and water contact angle analysis indicated that the plasma treatment introduced sulfide oxides (S=O and O=S=O) onto the PPS surface leading to a higher surface energy. A steady improvement of bonding shear strength was achieved with the increase of plasma treatment time or discharge power density, which was consistent with the failure mode study. According to the above analysis, the air DBD plasma treatment could effectively improve the adhesion property of PPS.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcing and toughening poly (phenylene sulfide) (PPS) with rigid SiO2 nano-particles was realized simultaneously under the suitable thermodynamic state of PPS, and the key issue about the effect of matrix/filler interaction was also demonstrated. The strong matrix/filler interaction realized by grafting reactive groups onto nanoparticles was beneficial for stress transfer and thus in favor of the increase in tensile strength of PPS. Meanwhile, this interaction provided nanoparticles with certain mobility to move with molecular chains and align along the tensile direction when T u003e Tg of PPS, thus the nanoparticles could significantly improve the tensile toughness of PPS according to the energy dissipation mechanism. Consequently, the tensile strength and elongation to break values of PPS increased to 59.0 MPa and 112.1 % from the initial values of 48.0 MPa and 78.5 % by adding 1 wt% grafted SiO2 nano-particles. The work provided a promising method to reinforce and toughen rigid-chain polymer simultaneously and prepare high-performance PPS nanocomposites.",

They were then reacted with 4,4\u2032-thiodibenzoyl chloride (TDC) to yield a series of semi-aromatic polyamides. Thermal property investigation confirmed a high glass transition temperature (Tg) of 163\u2013203 \u00b0C and a good thermal stability with initial degradation temperatures (Td) of 409 to 419 \u00b0C for the synthesized semi-aromatic polyamides, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) characterization. A water flux and retention rate for the resultant semi-aromatic polyamide membranes in the range of 89\u2013371 L (m2 h)\u22121 was observed when measured by ultrafiltration cup experiments, which suggests that they are suitable for separation processes. The resultant semi-aromatic polyamides showed good corrosion resistance especially in a strong alkaline environment.

Different contents of GN dispersed in the agent were introduced onto the surface of CF to prepare the CF-GN/polyphenylene sulfide composites. The surface topography and the distribution of GN sheets on the surface of CF were detected by scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the introduction of GN significantly increased the surface roughness of CF, which was beneficial to enhance mechanical interlocking between the fiber and matrix. The microbond test showed that there was the most appropriate GN content, at which the composites exhibited the highest interfacial shear strength (IFSS).

        "abstract": "Abstract   The aim of this study was synthesis of the polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) containing carboxyl unit and investigation of the effect of modified PPS used as compatibilizer on the interfacial micromechanical properties of carbon fiber (CF) reinforced PPS composites. A series of copoly(1,4-phenylene sulfide)-poly(2,5-phenylene sulfide acid) (PPS-COOH)s containing different proportions of carboxyl units in the side chain were synthesized by the reaction of dihalogenated monomer and sodium sulfide via nucleophilic substitution polymerization under high pressure. According to the results of FT-IR, DSC, TGA, mechanical test and contact angle test, all of the copolymers were found to have analogous structure and improved hydrophilic property comparing with neat PPS. There was a good physical compatibility between the modified PPS and the pure PPS. The microbond test (measuring apparent interfacial shear strength (\u03c4 app ) of the composite) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) also showed that the optimized PPS-COOH (7.5) can be used to improve the micro-mechanical properties and interfacial bonding between CF and PPS matrix. The maximum  \u03c4   app   of 10%PPS-COOH (7.5)/PPS/CF composite was 49.1\u00a0MPa, which had increased 36.0% comparing with that of the pure PPS/CF composite (36.1\u00a0MPa).",

        "abstract": "With polydopamine (PDA) acting as interlayer, combined with electrospinning technology and a silanization method, here a versatile method for fabricating a superhydrophobic PES/PDA/ODTS fibrous mat is reported. Scanning electron microscopy, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements were applied to characterize the morphologies and chemical composition changes of the prepared fibrous mats. Their separation ability for oil/water mixtures was measured by self-made instruments. The results show that the fabricated PES/PDA/ODTS fibrous mat displays a water contact angle too large to be assessed by the ordinary amount of water applied in a conventional measurement. In other words, a water drop of less than 10\u2009\u03bcL adheres to the syringe needle and leaves with it during the measurement. The prepared PES/PDA/ODTS fibrous mat also shows a threshold sliding angle no more than 2.5\u00b0. At the same time, this kind of material exhibits superoleophilicity for organic solvents, such as n-hexane, gasoline, toluene, and chloroform. The experimental contact angles were also analyzed using the Cassie\u2013Baxter model to gain insights into the fundamental microstructure\u2013wetting property relationship. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Firstly, the PES microspheres were produced by an electrospray method and then the magnetic properties were delivered to the microspheres through in situ reaction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with image analysis software, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to investigate the structure and morphology of the magnetic microspheres. The results indicate that the majority of the magnetic nanoparticles are dispersed uniformly and embedded into the surface of the PES electrosprayed microspheres. A vibrating sample magnetometer was used to evaluate the magnetic properties of the PES magnetic microspheres and the saturation magnetization values were found to be up to 23.96 emu g\u22121. A separation test showed that the prepared magnetic microspheres can realize fast separation under an external magnetic field. Additionally, compared with the original microsphere counterparts, PES magnetic microspheres exhibited better adsorption capacity and reuse performance in adsorption tests. These results indicate that the PES in situ magnetic microspheres have the potential to be used in water treatment and environmental depuration.",

The designed B-doped carbon improved Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  composite (abbreviated as Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 @C-B) is successfully synthesized using a sol-gel approach followed by a microwave heating route. The XRD and HRTEM results demonstrate that the well-crystallized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  particles are uniformly coated with the B-doped carbon layer with a thickness of about several nanometers. The existence of boron doping in the carbon layer is also confirmed by XPS and EDX mapping. Compared with the undoped Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 @C, the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 @C-B anode shows superior electrochemical performances such as higher reversible capacity and better cycling stability. The enhanced lithium-storage property can be attributed to the doped boron element which could bring many amazing improvements on the carbon coating. Therefore, this novel strategy of B-doped carbon coating can be widely used to improve the electronic conductivity of other electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, chemically reductive thioether units were introduced into the polyamide (PA) layer of a thin film composite (TFC) reverse osmosis (RO) membrane to enhance its chlorine resistance. The sulphur moieties could be oxidized to partially capture chlorine, therefore protecting the membrane from being chlorinated. The thioether units were introduced into the PA layer by partially replacing trimesoyl chloride (TMC) with 4, 4\u2032-thiodibenzoyl chloride (TDC) in the organic phase during interfacial polymerization. Both ATR-FTIR and XPS investigations revealed that the thioether units had been incorporated into the PA layer successfully. In addition, the introduced thioether units were also uniformly dispersed, as confirmed by the STEM-EDS results. The introduction of the thioether units influenced the morphology of the membrane significantly, which in turn markedly impacted its performance. The introduction of thioether groups was found to have a positive effect on improving the chlorine resistance of the TFC membrane. Taking the 60%-TDC-TFC membrane as an example, the chlorine exposure (95\u202fppm\u202fh) at which the normalized flux fell below 1 was much higher than that of the pure membrane (34\u202fppm\u202fh) when chlorinated in an acidic environment. Under alkaline conditions, the chlorine exposure (30,430\u202fppm\u202fh) at which the normalized rejection decreased to less than 1 was approximately three times of that of the pure membrane (10,839\u202fppm\u202fh). One step of the potential mechanism revealed by the ATR-FTIR and XPS results involved the incorporated thioether units consuming part of the chlorine and undergoing oxidation. Another involved the fact that both the produced sulfoxide and sulfone groups could form hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring hydrogens, which would replace the hydrogen bonds destroyed by chlorination.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Polymeric membranes have attracted much interest in recent years for use in organic solvent nanofiltration. This article reports the development of a novel solvent resistant oxidized poly (arylene sulfide sulfone) (PASS) membrane and proposes a new strategy to enhance the solvent resistance of this PASS membrane via improving the rigidity, intermolecular interaction and packing density of polymer chains by a simple oxidation process. The PASS membranes were firstly fabricated by phase inversion, and then a facile green oxidation process was carried out to improve their solvent resistance. The oxidized PASS (O-PASS) membrane was found to exhibit an excellent stability in aggressive solvents, such as DMF and NMP, and endure 98% H 2 SO 4  without sacrificing its filtration performance. In organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), the O-PASS membranes exhibited a high rejection of dyes such as rose Bengal (RB), erythrosin B (EB), reactive orange 16 (RB16) and Sudan black B (SBB), and a stable filtration performance for 30\u00a0h in DMF. Compared to other reported OSN membranes, this membrane showed an exceptionally high solvent permeation. This extraordinary OSN filtration performance, easy fabrication process and the strong solvent resistance, make PASS a very promising polymer in the field of OSN.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, electrospun core-shell thermo-sensitive(CSTS)ultrafine fibers were prepared successfully. The optimum structural polyethersulfone (PES) porous ultrafine fibers were chosen as core fabricated by electrospinning technology. In addtion, in order to improve the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm), acrylamide (Am) was chosen as the comonomer with excellent hydrophilicity and structural similarity to N-isopropylacrylamide. Thus, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide) P(NIPAm-co-Am) with higher LCST (LCST= 43 \u00b0C) was synthesized on the surface of PES fibers via radical copolymerization as shell. The introduction of the P(NIPAm-co-Am) influenced the morphology and performance of the PES ultrafine fibers significantly. Meanwhile, SEM, FTIR and XPS results all showed the P(NIPAm-co-Am) covered on the surface of PES fibers after polymerization for 4 h. Both the contact angle and shape change test indicated that the CSTS ultrafine fibers exhibited different wettability and area when the temperature was below and above the LCST due to the thermo-sensitive of P(NIPAm-co-Am) gels shell. Furthermore, curcumin was selected to use as drug model loaded in CSTS ultrafine fibers and the curcumin release behavior was tested to study the thermo-sensivity of CSTS ultrafine fibers. At 20 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C, the max curcumin release amount is w 33.21 % and w 80.15 %, respectively. The result directly demonstrated that CSTS ultrafine fibers had thermo-sensity as drug carrier. Finally, the cell culture studies showed that the prepared CSTS ultrafine fibers have a potential application in the biomedical fields.",

        "abstract": "As a result of manufacturing processes, thermal residual stresses often occur in fibre-reinforced polymer composites and affect the fibre/matrix interface properties, e.g. interfacial shear strength (IFSS), which is commonly evaluated by the microbond test. In thermoplastic matrices, thermal residual stresses can be relieved by annealing. In this study, to examine the effect of thermal residual stress on IFSS, microbond tests on both air-quenched (control) and annealed polyphenylene sulphide/carbon fibre samples are conducted. Comparing the pull-out results of the control to the annealed samples subjected to six different annealing temperatures between 80 and 230\u00a0\u00b0C, it is found that the thermal residual stresses in the fibre axial and radial directions are reduced progressively below and can be neglected above 120\u00a0\u00b0C. Thermal residual stresses in the fibre direction can be calculated to explain the microbond test results and construct a master curve for the IFSS. Post-debond frictional shear stresses can also be analysed in terms of the calculated fibre radial thermal residual stresses and debonded fibre morphologies.",

In this paper, by choosing a suitable dilute hydrophilic polymer solution as the core solution, polyethersulfone (PES) hollow ultrafine fibers with two different layers wall (porous structure layer and dense smooth layer) were formed during coaxial electrospinning process in one step. They showed good drug delivery capacity when curcumin was used as the model drug. There were much larger delivery amounts, more stable release rate, and higher utilization rate of PES hollow ultrafine fibers with a multilayer wall to curcumin than that of PES porous ultrafine fibers. Compared with porous ultrafine fibers, hollow ultrafine fibers with two different layers wall were more suitable to be used as drug delivery materials. Besides, between the two hollow ultrafine fibers with two different layers wall mentioned in this paper, there was much better drug delivery capacity for the hollow fibers produced with the core solution of PVA/DMSO. These results showed that PES hollow ultrafine fibers with two different layers wall have the potential to be used as the drug delivery materials.",

The inherent viscosities of the resultant different proportion of copolymers were in the range of 0.39\u20130.78 dL/g. These copolymers were found to have excellent thermal properties with glass transition temperatures (Tg) of 121\u2013177\u00b0C, and initial degradation temperatures (Td) of 417.5\u2013432.5\u00b0C. These copolymers showed good mechanical properties with tensile strengths of 45\u201383 MPa, storage modulus of 1.8\u20132.6 GPa. The complex viscosities of pure Poly(ether ether sulfone) (PEES) was in the range of 176,000\u2013309.8 Pas from 0.01 to 100 Hz, the complex viscosities of the copolymers decreased significantly with the increase of semi-aromatic amide content, the copolymers of 20% decreased from 4371 to 142.4 Pas (from 0.01 to 100 Hz), and the copolymers of 70% dropped from 634.6 Pas to 55.97 Pas (from 0.01 Hz to 100 Hz). All copolymers exhibited non-Newtonian and shear-thinning behavior. These results suggested the resultant copolymers possess better melt flowability that is beneficial for the materialsu0027 melt processing. POLYM. ENG.

Especially, the influence of water content on seismic source function is studied, and it reveals that the coupling energy of underground explosion increases with the increase of the water content. The steady-state value of RDP in water-saturated granite is higher than that in dry granite, and correspondingly, the value increases with the increase of water content. However, the corner frequency of RVP\u2019s amplitude spectrum of water-saturated granite is lower than that in dry granite, and its value decreases with the increase of water content. The asymptotic behavior of RVP at high frequencies, or roll-off, is thought to be steeper than f~ -2 . The overshoot of RDP at the far-field is not obvious.",

And the corresponding surface ground motions induced by underground explosions were observed by a series of seismometers. By using these observed data, the source parameters were obtained, as well as the seismic coupling efficiency represented by the steady value of reduced velocity potential at low frequencies. Experimental results display that for the underground explosions with the same scaled depth of burial and same explosion equivalent, the seismic coupling efficiency was strongly dependant on the source medium property in such a way that the medium strength plays the most significant roles in determining the seismic coupling effect and then the porosity and the water saturation. And based on the experimental data, the feasibility of the empirical formula proposed by M. D. Denny, et al was analyzed in estimating the seismic coupling effect of underground explosions with the explosion equivalent of 100 kg TNT.",

        "abstract": "Because of the restrict by funds condition and geologic setting,it is impossible for the defense layer of civil air defense works to be thickened without limit,therefore in view of the damping effect and dispersion effect of layered structures on blast waves,it is necessary to investigate the layered structure's defense effect of civil air defense works' distribution layer against nuclear explosive loadings.A series of large-scale analogy-simulation tests were conducted on layered structure's defense effect of distribution layer against nuclear explosive loadings by utilizing the loading technology of nuclear explosion analogy with plane charge explosive.The layered structure defense effect of a distribution layer against nuclear explosive loadings is better than that of a single-layer structure,as demonstrated by four subtly designed plane charge explosive loading tests with different kinds of layered structures.",

Both the impact velocity and the residual velocity were measured, and the failure form were observed and recorded. The experiment results show that the velocity of the ballistic reduces with the increase of volume content of steel fiber. The targets consumed much energy, and the targets destroyed less. The results clearly show that the ultra-short steel fiber has obvious strengthen effect for concrete target to resist the penetration and perforation of projectile, and such anti-penetration ability increases with the increase of fiber fraction.",

One is variable modulus Drucker-Prager criterion which considers the effect of pore collapse on mechanical behavior of porous rock,and the other is modified cap model which introduces porosity evolution based on mixture theory and general cap model. Secondly,spherical elasto-plastic wave propagation in porous tuff induced by underground explosion was numerically simulated by FDM,and some basic characteristics of stress waves in porous rock were illuminated. Lastly,based on the numerical calculations on the stress waves in porous tuff,the main characteristics of seismic source function in underground chemical explosion were studied,and the influences of porosity on seismic source function were analyzed.",

The entire computational domain is divided into several subdomains.

Stress-strain curves of the ceramic form under three different conditions mentioned above were obtained and the strength, deformation, and failure behavior of the material were discussed. The results indicated that (1)the ceramic form is a strain rate sensitive material; (2)Although the elastic limit of the ceramic form is not as large as normal ceramic but its strength keeps a certain value after the peak stress reachesd; (3) the ceramic form has a large extreme strain under both static and dynamic loading and its energy loss related to the irreversible deformation due to pore collapse in the material in a loading-unloading cycle is considerable, and hence the effects of its wave absorption and energy dissipation are prominent. It was suggested that the ceramic form can be considered as one of the important materials for protective components in engineering.",

The maximum and minimum responses of the structure are determined via the convex analysis. The maximum response then is regulated by suitable choice of the support location. Specifically, we determine the location of the support so as to yield the minimum of the maximum response. By this means we minimize, by support placing, the worst, anti-optimized response of the structure, and thus increase its safety. Whereas there are studies devoted to uncertain imperfections, as well as to free vibration of structures with additional supports, the present study appears to be the first one that introduces the idea of regulation by support placing in structures with uncertain imperfections.\u00a9 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

As the probabilistic information of these uncertainties lacks, the non-probabilistic interval analysis framework is developed to quantify the interval of the structural element stiffness parameters. According to the interval intersection of the element stiffness parameters in the undamaged and damaged states, the possibility of damage existence is defined based on the reliability theory. A damage measure index is then proposed as the product of the nominal stiffness reduction and the defined possibility of damage existence. This new index simultaneously reflects the damage severity and possibility of damage at each structural component. Numerical and experimental examples are presented to illustrate the validity and applicability of the method.

For the linear static problem, when there are uncertain interval parameters in the stiffness matrix and the vector of applied forces, the static response may be an interval. Based on the interval operations, the interval solution obtained by the vertex solution is more accurate and more credible than other methods (such as the perturbation method). However, the vertex solution method by traditional serial computing usually needs large computational efforts, especially for large structures. In order to avoid its disadvantages of large calculation and much runtime, its parallel computing which can be used in large-scale computing is presented in this paper.

Due to the scarcity of uncertain information, the uncertainties are considered as interval numbers in this article. Via the first-order Taylor series expansion, the interval bounds of the elemental stiffness parameters of undamaged and damaged structures are obtained. The structural damage is detected by the quantitative measure of the possibility of damage existence in elements, which is more reasonable than the probability of damage existence in the condition of less measurement data. In this study, the conversation of the interval analysis method is remarkably reduced by the membership-set identification technique. The present method is applied to a truss structure and a steel cantilever plate for damage identification, and the damage identification results obtained by the interval analysis method and probabilistic method are compared. This article also discusses the effects of damage level and uncertainty level on detection results. The numerical examples show that the wide intervals resulting from the interval operation can be narrowed by the proposed non-probabilistic approach, and the feasibility and applicability of the present method are validated. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2012.",

        "abstract": "This study shows that the type of the analytical treatment that should be adopted for non-probabilistic analysis of uncertainty depends upon the available experimental data. The main idea is based on the consideration that the maximum structural response predicted by the preferred theory ought be minimal, and the minimum structural response predicted by the preferred theory ought be maximal, to constitute a lower overestimation. Prior to the analysis the existing data ought be enclosed by the minimum volume hyper-rectangle V1 that contains all experimental data. The experimental data also have to be enclosed by the minimum volume ellipsoid V2. If V1 is smaller than V2 and the response calculated based on it R(V1) is smaller than R(V2), then one has to prefer interval analysis. However, if V1 is in excess of V2 and R(V1) is greater than R(V2), then the analyst ought to utilize convex modeling. If V1 equals V2 or these two quantities are in close vicinity, then two approaches can be utilized with nearly equal validity. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.",

Uncertainty is described by the fact that the precise distribution of the load is unknown, however, the Fourier components of it are bounded by an ellipsoid. The maximum possible displacement as well as maximum possible bending moment are determined as a first step. In the second step, these maximum quantities are minimized by placing the support in the proper location.

This paper is concerned with the structural vibration problem involving uncertain material or geometric parameters, specified as bounds on these parameters. This produces interval stiffness and mass matrices, and the problem is transformed into a generalized interval eigenvalue problem in interval mathematics. However tighter bounds on the eigenvalues may be obtained by using the formulation of the structural dynamic problem. Often the stiffness and mass matrices can be formed as a non-negative decomposition in the uncertain structural parameters. In this case the eigenvalue bounds may be obtained from the parameter vertex solutions. Even more efficiently, using interval extension from interval mathematics, the generalized interval eigenvalue problem may be divided into two generalized eigenvalue problems for real symmetric matrix pairs. The parameter vertex solution algorithm is compared with Deif's solution, the eigenvalue inclusion principle and the interval perturbation method in numerical examples.",

Although the system parameters or properties are uncertain in many engineering problems, but their probable range of values i.e. upper and lower bounds, can be provided from practical experience and engineering knowledge. Moreover, to avoid the resonance of a structure and to consider the dynamic response of an uncertain one, and also for reliability and stability analysis, we often need the bounds of the ranges of structural characteristic parameters such as natural frequency and normal mode. By using modal analysis and interval calculus, we investigate the method of computing upper and lower bounds of paramenters such as, natural frequencies, modal shapes, and FRFs. Theoretically, it is possible to analyze the uncertain-but-bounded of a structure by using modal analysis and interval calculus. They can be estimated by modal interval analysis. On the basis of the estimated intervals, the engineering structure parameters can be applied into engineering design. A numerical example is presented for a tower structure, and the results illustrate that the proposed method is effective. A comparison of the modal interval method with the results of Monte Carlo simulation serves to validate the solutions and to identify the bounded ranges of parameters.",

Based on interval mathematics and Taylor series expansion, interval analytical method simplifies the uncertain parameters to interval vectors so that it can get the intervals within which the response of structure varies when less information of structure is known. The interval analytical method is efficient under the condition that probability approach can not work because of small samples and spare statistics characteristics. The formulation of natural frequencies of composite laminate using interval analytical method was formulated. Two numerical examples of comparison between interval analytical method and convex model were given. The results show that the solutions of interval analytical method are sharper than that of convex model.",

In this paper, it evaluates the upper and lower bounds on the eigenvalues of the standard eigenvalue problem of structures subject to severely deficient information about the structural parameters. Here, we focus on non-probabilistic interval analysis models of uncertainty, which are adapted to the case of severe lack of information on uncertainty. Non-probabilistic, interval analysis method in which uncertainties are defined by interval numbers appears as an alternative to the classical probabilistic models. For the standard eigenvalue problem of structures with uncertain-but-bounded parameters, the vertex solution theorem, the positive semi-definite solution theorem and the parameter decomposition solution theorem for the standard eigenvalue problem are presented, and compared with Deif's solution theorem in numerical examples. It is shown that, for the upper and lower bounds on the eigenvalues of the standard eigenvalue problem with uncertain-but-bounded parameters, the presented vertex solution theorem is unconditional, and the positive semi-definite solution theorem and the parameter decomposition solution theorem have less limitary conditions compared with Deif's solution theorem.

The initial geometric imperfection may be uncertain due to the manufacture errors and so on, so this will lead to the uncertainty of the buckling load or the dynamic buckling response of structure. The problem of dynamic buckling failure of rod with uncertain initial geometrical imperfection under the axial dynamic loading was studied. The safety factor was defined based on the integral deflection. The uncertain initial geometrical imperfection was described by interval analysis and convex models respectively, and then the least favorable estimation on the dynamic buckling safety factor of rod was evaluated based on the integral displacements.

Due to the scarcity of uncertain information, the uncertainties were considered as interval numbers in this paper. Via the first-order Taylor series expansion, the interval bounds of the elemental stiffness parameters of undamaged and damaged structures are respectively obtained. The structural damage was detected by the quantitative measure of the possibility of damage existence in elements, which was more reasonable than the probability of damage existence in the condition of less sample points for the measurement data. Furthermore, the classic interval analysis method was improved by adopting the membership-set identification and two-step model updating procedure to make identification results more accurate. An uncertain truss structure was employed for damage identification, the damage identification results obtained by interval analysis method and probabilistic method, respectively, were compared. Moreover, the effects on the detection results of the damage level and uncertainty level subjected to single or multiple load cases were studied as well. The numerical example shows that the wide intervals resulting from the interval operation can be narrowed by the improved nonprobabilistic approach, and the feasibility and effectiveness of the present method were validated. \u00a9 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.",

Considering that the exact statistic characteristics of uncertain parameters such as the clearances and dimensions may not be available by virtue of the limited sample information in practical engineering, this paper investigates a new time-dependent reliability assessment method with insufficient uncertainty information. Firstly, to quantify the uncertainty effects of clearances and dimensions on kinematic performance, the clearances are assumed to be convex variables which confined within the clearance circle and the dimensions are regarded as interval variables. Furthermore, an integral procedure of non-probabilistic time-dependent reliability assessment by combination of the interval mathematics and the first-passage theory is proposed, and with the help of the regularization treatment, its solution strategy is mathematically conducted as well. By comparison with Monte-Carlo simulation method, two engineering examples are eventually presented to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the developed method.",

NI-IUAM decomposes one multidisciplinary system into single disciplines and utilizes a Newton iteration equation to obtain the upper and lower bounds of coupled state variables at each iterative step. NI-IUAM only needs to determine the bounds of uncertain parameters and does not require specific distribution formats. In this way, NI-IUAM may greatly reduce the necessity for raw data. In addition, NI-IUAM can accelerate the convergence process as a result of the super-linear convergence of Newton iteration. The applicability of the proposed method is discussed, in particular that solutions obtained in each discipline must be compatible in multidisciplinary systems.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Based on the leaky rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, the paper proposes a modified leaky ReLU scheme (MLRS) for topology optimization with multiple materials. A continuous function formed by sequence of modified leaky ReLU functions are used for the material property interpolation. No extra design variables will be introduced for whatever number of materials considered. Thus, the computational cost is independent to material types. Since the modified leaky ReLU function only consists of two linear functions, the sensitivity of objective and constraint functions is easy to derive. Besides, the sensitivity of MSRL stays a proper constant number even when the design variable is sufficiently small, which may help the convergence. The discontinuous points of derivatives can be jumped across smoothly so that stable transitions can be guaranteed from one type of material to another. An optimal criteria (OC) based solution method is derived from the KKT condition, and an interior point method based solution procedure is introduced for more complex cases. The proposed method is general and straightforward, and is compatible with the existing optimization algorithms. Numerical examples including structural and thermal topology optimization are used to verify the proposed method. The results demonstrate its efficiency and stability.",

Conversely, the traditional safety factor (SF) design method faded out of the horizon of the designer since it considers only the mean value of design variable without the effect of dispersion properties, which has been verified to be not reasonable. In previous studies, only the physical interpretation that NRBDO method is superior compared to the SF method was given. In this paper, we make attempts to seek a mathematical explanation through design domain in which NRBDO method and SF method search for the optimal design solution, which presents strong evidences why NRBDO theory is more advanced and reasonable method from the aspects of mathematical proof.

        "abstract": "In view of the significant influences of multi-source uncertainties on structural safety, which generally exist in practical engineering (such as the dispersion of material, the uncertainty of external load and the error of processing technology), more academic research and engineering applications had paid attention to uncertainty in recent years. However, due to the complexity of the structural problems, there may be multiple uncertain parameters. Traditional methods of optimal design by single-source uncertainty model, particularly the one derived from probability theory, may no longer be feasible. This paper investigates a new formulation and numerical solution of reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) of structures exhibiting random and uncertain-but-bounded (interval and convex) mixed uncertainties. Combined with the non-probabilistic set-theory convex model and the classical probabilistic approach, the mathematical definition of hybrid reliability is firstly presented for a quantified measure of the safety margin. The reliability-based optimization incorporating such mixed reliability constraints is then formulated. The PSO algorithm is employed to improve the convergence and the stability in seeking the optimal global solution. Additionally, by introducing the general concept of the safety factor, the compatibility between the proposed hybrid RBDO technique and the safety factor-based model is further discussed. By virtue of the above two methods, two numerical examples of typical components (the cantilever structure and the truss structure) as well as one complex engineering example (the hypersonic wing structure) are performed, subjected to the strength or stiffness criteria. The accuracy and effectiveness of the present method are then demonstrated.",

In view of this, this study develops a novel approach of non-probabilistic reliability based controller design for servo mechanisms and the related solution details are further expounded. The uncertainty quantification of dynamic response is conducted by the combination of the first-order Taylor expansion and interval mathematics. The non-probabilistic reliability with consideration of time-dependency for servo mechanisms is obtained by the first passage theory and interval process model.

This paper proposes an uncertain optimization method based on interval model updating technique and non-probabilistic reliability (NPR) theory. A novel interval model updating method is firstly established by modifying the deterministic constraint condition parameters, which retains the quantification results of the material parameters and has a convinced updating model. In the design section, a new two-step optimization process for composite structures, which combines NPR method and progressive failure theory, is presented based on the updated simulation model. The traditional composite structural design method (safety factor based method) is also introduced to be compared. The NPR based optimization can optimize the nominal value and deviation of the structural response simultaneously, and will achieve a more significant weight reduction effect. A complete process including the uncertainty quantification, interval model updating, NPR based optimization and experimental verification for a composite stiffened plate under the compressive and shear load conditions were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",

        "abstract": "SummaryBased on the availability of measured acceleration signals of structures, the interval analysis technique and set-membership identification concept are combined to identify the structural damage in this paper. Because of the insufficiency and uncertainty of information obtained from measurements, the noises of measurements are enveloped by interval numbers. Via the first-order Taylor series expansion, the interval bounds of the element stiffness parameters (ESPs) of both undamaged and damaged structures are derived by updating the reference finite element model. Through the intersection operations of intervals of the ESP obtained from dynamic responses in different time periods, the estimate intervals of the ESP are refined. Three damage indexes as stiffness reduce factor, possibility of damage existence, and damage measure index are introduced to identify the damage in the structure. Even though the dynamic responses are with low signal-to-noise ratio, the injury of structure can be detected by the proposed method. Two numerical examples and an experimental example are performed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed technique. The results show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of damage diagnosis compared with the deterministic damage identification method.

Typical approaches for performing time-variant reliability assessment are always based upon the random process model, where the dynamic distributions of uncertain parameters are determined by a substantial number of samples. In this paper, a new time-variant reliability measurement based on a non-probabilistic interval process model is proposed, in which we describe the time-varying uncertain variables at any time as intervals and define the corresponding auto-covariance function and correlation coefficient function to characterize the correlation between limit states at different times. By combining with the set-theory approach and the classical first-passage theory, a new non-probabilistic model of safety evaluation for time-dependent structures is established, and its measure index is then analytically calculated. The proposed model of time-variant reliability is suitable for both the cases of stationary process and non-stationary process. Moreover, the Monte Carlo method is also presented as a means of verification. The comparison between the presented model and the Monte Carlo-based model is eventually carried out on two application examples; the usage, efficiency and accuracy of the developed approach can be demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Considering that numerous sample data points are required in the probabilistic method, a non-probabilistic interval analysis method can be an alternative when the information is insufficient. In the paper, new strategies, which are iterative algorithm based interval uncertainty analysis methods (IA-IUAMs), are developed to acquire the bounds of the responses in multidisciplinary system. Two iterative processes, Jacobi iteration and Seidel iteration, are applied in the new methods respectively. The Jacobi iteration based interval uncertainty analysis method (JI-IUAM) utilizes the strategy of concurrent subsystem analysis to improve computational efficiency while the Seidel iteration based interval uncertainty analysis method (SI-IUAM) can accelerate convergence by utilizing the newest information. Both IA-IUAMs are able to evaluate the bounds of responses accurately and quickly. The presented methods are compared with general sensitivity analysis based interval uncertainty analysis method (SIUAM) and conventional Monte Carlo simulation approach (MCS). The validity and efficiency of the new methods are demonstrated by two numerical examples and two engineering examples. Results show that, on the one hand, IA-IUAMs are more efficient than MCS by avoiding hundreds of system analyses, on the other hand, IA-IUAMs are more accurate and have a wider range of application than SIUAM by avoiding linear approximation and global sensitivity calculation.",

In this paper, the purpose is to propose a novel reliability-based two-level optimization design method including thickness and stacking sequence optimizations, where uncertain parameters of composites are taken into account for reliability evaluation. Firstly, by characterizing existing uncertain parameters of composites as random or interval variables, one can carry out uncertainty analysis for structural responses. Then the evaluation models of probabilistic and non-probabilistic reliabilities are separately introduced when treating uncertainties as random and interval variables. Furthermore, by combining the reliabilities with the two-level optimization model, a novel reliability-based two-level optimization model is advanced and the detailed optimization procedures are listed for convenience of understanding. Lastly, two numerical examples including a simple-supported composite plate and a composite wingtip of aerospace plane are given out to demonstrate the validity and availability of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully and efficiently applied in the optimization design of composite structures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Non-probabilistic reliability based multidisciplinary design optimization (NRBMDO) offers a powerful tool for making reliable decisions with the consideration of uncertain-but-bounded uncertainties for complex engineering systems. However, the prohibitive computation and convergence difficulties caused by the directly coupling of uncertainty based multidisciplinary analysis (UMDA), non-probabilistic reliability analysis (NRA) and MDO would seriously hamper the application of NRBMDO. In this paper, an efficient single loop strategy for NRBMDO (SLS_NRBMDO) is developed to decouple the nested issue and thus improve the computational efficiency. The key idea of the proposed strategy is decoupling NRBMDO with several cycles of sequential MDO, UMDA, NRA and translating distance calculation (TDC). For UMDA, three methods, i.e., the first order interval Taylor expansion method, the interval vertex theorem, the direct optimization approach are formulated. Besides, NRA is conducted on the basis of the expanded non-probabilistic stress\u2013strength interference model and the volume ratio thought, which provides a clear and definite assessment criterion for the structural safety with uncertain-but-bounded parameters. Furthermore, the translating strategy based on the performance measure approach is proposed to shift and update the constraints, and the expression of the translating distance is mathematically derived to accelerate the design procedure. Eventually, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are illustrated with one numerical case and one practical supersonic wing optimization design problem.",

Firstly, by virtue of the theory of non-probabilistic interval process, an interval process model of fatigue crack propagation is investigated, in which we describe uncertain crack length     a  (  N  )     at any load cycle    N    as interval variable and define the corresponding auto-covariance function and the correlation coefficient function to further characterize the correlation of     a  (  N  )     at different cycles. By comparison of the critical crack length      a    c  r  i  t  i  c  a  l     , the uncertainty properties of the time-varying limit-state function can be given as well. Furthermore, inspired by the first-passage approach in random process theory, a new measure index of non-probabilistic time-dependent reliability is proposed as a feasible way for precisely evaluating the safe life of in-service engineering structures with crack. The corresponding solution algorithm is further discussed. Some application examples demonstrate the usage, efficiency and accuracy of the developed methodology eventually.",

By introducing the interference principle of sound wave, responses under control can be obtained by solving finite element equations of structural\u2013acoustic coupling systems. Through synthetical considerations of parameter dispersion in practice, the interval quantitative model, which only needs limited sample data, is defined, and the interval Taylor extension approach is employed to further determine boundary rules of responses of structural vibration and acoustic noise. On this basis, a new interval-oriented robust optimization framework is established to seek the optimal secondary force to simultaneously minimize nominal and radius levels of sound pressure indexes at concerned space and frequency domains. A complicated engineering example of the 3-D bomb cavity is eventually presented, in which numerical and experimental results can demonstrate the usage, validity and effectiveness of the developed methodology.",

First, Chebyshev basis functions are involved to construct the approximate relation between the system output variables and initial interval parameters dimension by dimension in multidisciplinary frameworks. The Gauss\u2013Chebyshev quadrature formulas are then utilized to confirm coefficients of the fitting function. Due to the weakness of traditional dimension-wise method, that is, it ignores the coupling effects of uncertain variables, a new iterative dimension-wise method (IDWM) where the nominal states of intervals can be updated in each iteration, is proposed. Discussions on efficiency and accuracy are further expounded. Both numerical and engineering examples are eventually given to demonstrate the usage and validity of the developed methodology, and results indicate that the presented IDWM has a superiority in uncertainty propagation problems of multidisciplinary issues.",

A systematic model validation procedure including uncertainty quantification, model update and prediction is described based on a non-probabilistic interval model. The crucial technical challenge in model validation is limited data, thus the non-probabilistic interval model is adopted to describe uncertain parameters. To establish the model update formula, the concepts of the interval escape rate and interval coverage rate are first described. Then, not only can the possibility of failure be estimated but also the credibility of the possibility of failure based on the proposed model validation method. The data in the validation experiment are used to update the credibility of each interval model, while the data from the accreditation experiment are used to conduct a final check of the validated models. To demonstrate that the proposed method can be applied to model validation problems successfully, a validation benchmark, the static frame challenge problem, is implemented. In addition, a practical aviation structure engineering validation problem is described. The results of these two validation problems show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model validation method. The theoretical framework proposed in this paper is also suitable for model validation of computational simulations in other research fields.",

Because parametric deviations due to inherent nature or external excitation are inevitable and can severely influence the final performance of real control systems, optimal active control considering uncertainty is gradually becoming a major concern in modern theory fields. In this paper, a novel non-probabilistic time-variant reliability-based optimization (NTRBO) strategy is presented for closed-loop controller design of vibration reduction issues. First, boundary rules and auto-correlation characteristics of controlled responses are confirmed based on the state-space transformation and the interval process approach. Then, enlightened by models of the first passage and the safety factor (SF), a new definition of the time-variant reliability measurement is provided. As keys to construct the optimal controller, weighing matrices in the Riccati equation are finally determined by solving the developed NTRBO model. The validity and the feasibility of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by several example applications, and the results reveal that uncertainty factors in optimal active control can be addressed from a new time-variant reliability perspective.",

In this paper, a sequential multidisciplinary design optimization and reliability analysis method under non-probabilistic theory is developed to decouple the reliability analysis from the optimization. The multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO), interval uncertainty analysis and the reliability analysis are conducted in a sequential manner. Furthermore, a dimension-by-dimension method (DDM) is proposed to conduct the interval uncertainty analysis. The calculation of the reliability under interval uncertainty is deduced based on the volume ratio theory. The shifting distance of the limit state function is also deduced. Both numerical and engineering examples are employed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.",

Unlike the existing collocation methods which construct surrogate model using preselected samples at fixed points, the BCM chooses samples sequentially and adaptively. Based on Bayesian inference theorem, the BCM constructs a crude Gaussian process surrogate model of structural response with selected samples. Then two acquisition functions named upper expected improvement ( EI_UP ) function and lower expected improvement ( EI_LO ) function are defined simultaneously to guide the selection of next samples. The samples will be collocated to the place where extrema of structural response are most likely to be found. The procedure will repeat until the convergence criterion is met. The extrema of the selected samples can be regarded as structural response bounds. Fewer samples are needed compared with existing collocation methods. Two numerical examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. The results are compared with those obtained by existing methods. The application of the method is performed by an engineering example. The results show the validity of the proposed method.",

Based on the interval set-theoretic model, traditional displacement constraint is transformed into the non-probabilistic reliability format, in which a novel measuring index, namely, the optimization feature distance is defined by a combination of the area-ratio ideas. Thus, the optimal layout issue is converted by the lightweight design problem with displacement reliability constraints. Moreover, the interval parametric vertex approach and the adjoint vector method are also employed to obtain the sensitivity information between the reliability measurement and design variables. By utilizing the method of moving asymptotes (MMA), the optimization problem that is investigated can be solved iteratively. Two engineering examples are eventually presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the methodology that has been developed, and numerical results show that considering the UBB uncertainty effects during the whole procedure of topology optimization may have a significant influence on the final structural configurations.",

Reducing the noise and optimizing the structural\u2013acoustic system in an effective way is of great importance. Because of the uncertainty existing in the structural or acoustic parameters, traditional deterministic optimization may be unfeasible when the parameters are subject to fluctuations. When the structural or acoustic parameters have uncertainty, the design scheme obtained from the deterministic optimization may be beyond the scope of the method. Therefore, we must develop an optimization method that can consider the uncertainties in the involved parameters. To accomplish this, a robust optimization method of structural\u2013acoustic coupled systems with random parameters is proposed based on the traditional optimization method. Two methods of robust optimization for structural\u2013acoustic systems are introduced including the objective function robustness and the constraint condition robustness. The multi-objective optimization problem is transformed into a single objective problem using a weight factor. The results of the two numerical examples illustrate the efficacy of the proposed robust optimization method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Structural safety assessment issue, considering the influence of uncertain factors, is widely concerned currently. However, uncertain parameters present time-variant characteristics during the entire structural design procedure. Considering materials aging, loads varying and damage accumulation, the current reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) strategy that combines the static/time-invariant assumption with the random theory will be inapplicable when tackling with the optimal design issues for lifecycle mechanical problems. In light of this, a new study on non-probabilistic time-dependent reliability assessment and design under time-variant and time-invariant convex mixed variables is investigated in this paper. The hybrid reliability measure is first given by the first-passage methodology, and the solution aspects should depend on the regulation treatment and the convex theorem. To guarantee the rationality and efficiency of the optimization task, the improved GA algorithm is involved. Two numerical examples are discussed to demonstrate the validity and usage of the presented methodology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper proposes a new interval uncertainty analysis method for static response of structures with unknown-but-bounded parameters by using radial basis functions (RBFs). Recently, collocation methods (CM) which apply orthogonal polynomials are proposed to solve interval uncertainty quantification problems with high accuracy. These methods overcome the drawback of Taylor expansion based methods, which are prone to overestimate the response bounds. However, the form of orthogonal basis functions is very complicated in higher dimensions, which may restrict their application when there exist relatively more interval parameters. In contrast to orthogonal basis function, the form of radial basis function (RBF) is simple and stays the same in whatever dimension. This study introduces RBFs into interval analysis of structures and provides a relatively simple approach to solve structural response bounds accurately. A surrogate model of real structural response with respect to interval parameters is constructed with the RBFs. The extrema of the surrogate model can be calculated by some auxiliary methods. The static response bounds can be obtained accordingly. Two numerical examples are used to verify the proposed method. The engineering application of the proposed method is performed by a center wing-box. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Then, two index functions, named lower confidence bound (LCB) and upper confidence bound (UCB) respectively, are defined for sample collocation. The index functions guide the search for the optima of structural response. After iterations, a sophisticated surrogate model will be obtained and the interval bounds of dynamic response can be calculated quickly with some auxiliary algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA). Numerical examples and engineering application are studied to verify the effectiveness of BSK.

For strongly nonlinear systems, in particular, this methodology requires parameter variation over narrower ranges in comparison with other methods. To implement sensitivity analysis based on this method, the interval ranges of the responses of the vibro-acoustic system with interval parameters should first be obtained. Therefore, an interval perturbation-analysis method is presented for obtaining the interval bounds of the sound-pressure responses of a coupled vibro-acoustic system with interval parameters. The interval perturbation method is then compared with the Monte Carlo method, which can be taken as the benchmark for comparative accuracy.

Based on the non-probabilistic set-theoretic theory, which is applied to measuring the safety of structural components and further combined with the branch-and-bound method for the probabilistic reliability analysis of structural systems, the non-probabilistic branch-and-bound method for determining the dominant failure modes of an uncertain structural system is given. Meanwhile, a new system safety measuring index obtained by the non-probabilistic set-theoretic model is investigated. Moreover, the compatibility between the classical probabilistic model as well as the proposed interval-set model will be discussed to verify the physical meaning of the safety measure in this paper. Some numerical examples are utilized to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the developed method.",

The state-space representation of active vibration control system with uncertain parameters is presented. Compared with the robust control theory, which is always over-conservative, the reliability-based analysis method is more suitable to deal with uncertain problem. Stability is the core of the closed-loop feedback control system design, so stability criterion is adopted to act as the limited state function for reliability analysis. The uncertain parameters without enough samples are modeled as interval variables. Interval perturbation method is employed to estimate the interval bounds of eigenvalues, which can be used to characterize the stability of the closed-loop active control system. Formulation of defining the reliability of active control system based on stability is discussed. A novel non-probabilistic reliability measurement index is discussed and used to determine the probability of the stability based on the area ratio. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by two numerical examples.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Computational fluid dynamics based unsteady aerodynamic reduced-order models can significantly improve the efficiency of transonic aeroelastic analysis. In this paper, the concept of the conventional model reduction method based on the system identification theory is extended to aerodynamic subsystems with the consideration of computational fluid dynamics-induced interval uncertainties in simulation to get the aerodynamic reduced-order model as uncertain as the original aerodynamic subsystem. The interval estimation of identified coefficients involved in the uncertain reduced-order model is obtained by utilizing the first-order interval perturbation method. The stability problem of the interval aeroelastic state-space model formulated based on the constructed uncertain aerodynamic reduced-order model is equivalently transformed into a standard interval eigenvalue problem associated with a real non-symmetric interval matrix in which the interval bounds of eigenvalues are evaluated by virtue of the first-order interval matrix perturbation algorithm. A new stability criterion for the interval aeroelastic state matrix is defined to predict the robust flutter boundary of the concerned uncertain aeroelastic system. Two numerical examples with respect to the uncertain aerodynamic ROM constructions and robust flutter boundary predictions of the two-dimensional Isogai wing and the three-dimensional AGARD 445.6 wing in transonic regime are implemented to assess the validity and accuracy of the presented approach. The obtained results are also compared with Monte Carlo simulation solutions as well as numerical and experimental results in the literatures indicating that the proposed method can provide a more robust and conservative prediction on the flutter boundary of an aeroelastic system compared with conventional deterministic aeroelastic analysis approaches.",

The general behavior, body weight, food availability ect. were observed during the experiment. At the end of the experiment, blood and urine samples were collected for routine and biochemical assays. The internal organs were taken for calculating their organ coefficients and histopathological examinations.During the experimental period, no obvious abnormality were found in the experimental animals. The body weight and the total food availability rate in the high dosage group of male were lower than that of control (P < 0.05). Hematology examination showed that the quantity of Hb and RBC in high dosage groups of both the male and female and Hb in the male middle group were all lower than the control group (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Analysis of correlation indicated that r = -0.433, P < 0.01 in male, r = -0.337, P < 0.01 in female of Hb; r = -0.266, P < 0.05 in male, r = -0.317, P < 0.01 in female of RBC. There were obviously negative correlation. Serum biochemistry examination showed the concentration of CHO in the high and middle dosage treated rats of male and female were higher than that of the control (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Analysis of correlation indicated that r = 0.497, P < 0.01 in male, r = 0.417, P < 0.01 in female. No abnormality were found in urine examination. The organ weight and organ coefficient such as liver, were higher than control group (P < 0.01). The result of histopathological examinations displayed that the renal tubule Cast and the tubulointerstitial nephritis in the treated groups were higher than that of control group (P < 0.01).97% ITX could obviously interfere with the animals' physical condition, and reduce the number of RBC and the concentration of Hb in the blood, interact metabolism of lipoid and induce the concentration of CHO in the serum. The livers of the treated rats are compensatory enlarged. And kidneys of the poisoning animals are damaged. The 2 years oral NOAEL of 97% ITX in rats are more than 4.63 mg/kg for female rats, and larger than 4.06 mg/kg for male rats.",

The results show that the difference of soil temperature among different soil moisture treatments is remarkable. Soil temperature under severe water deficit treatment is higher than that under other water deficit treatments in the whole growth stage of spring wheat, and the daily maximum temperature is 9.8\u2103 higher than that under the well-watering treatments on non-mulched field. And the daily maximum soil temperature under the well-watering treatment, the light water deficit treatment and the medium water deficit treatment on plastic film mulched wheat is 6.4\u2103, 4.6\u2103 and 1.7\u2103 higher than that under the well-watering treatments, respectively. Influenced by the different factors, there is a remarkable difference of soil temperature during the trefoil stage and filling stage, which the range of daily soil temperature varies from 2.1\u2103 to 11.4\u2103, and from 2.4\u2103 to 13.5\u2103, respectively. The variation of daily soil temperature decreases from the top (34.6-40.9\u2103) to 25cm depth (3.0 -3.5\u2103). There is no significant difference under the light water deficit and the medium water deficit treatment on plastic film mulched wheat at the depth of 0-5cm from the top. There is extremly significant difference among other treatments. The research results provids a theory basis for regulating soil temperature of plastic film mulched spring wheat and establishing irrigation schedule.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the changes in water consumption structure in order to take measures for demand control is very important for sustainable water resources management. In this study, using the Southern China area of Nanjing as an example, we employed the information entropy method to analyze the water consumption structure, as well as the grey incidence analysis to analyze synthetic incidence degree of the factors associated with agricultural, industrial, domestic, and ecological water consumption. The results show that the degree of balance among water consumption sectors has increased from 0.755 to 0.825 between 1993 and 2014. Gradual decrease of the relative proportion of a single water user structure in a water consumption system has made the utilization of water resources in Nanjing rational and diversified. The study identifies three stages of transformation of water structure in Nanjing, namely, a growth period from 1993 to 2002, an adjustment period from 2003 to 2010, and another growth period from 2011 to 2014. The synthetic incidence degree analysis indicates that adjustments of the agricultural and industrial water consumption as well as water saving measures are the main factors that affected water consumption structure in Nanjing. It is expected that the results obtained from this study will provide references to optimize the utilization of urban water resources.",

It is anticipated that the property sector could be affected by variable climate and related extremes as well as by the strategies adopted to combat greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper aims to analyse the current knowledge regarding future climate changes to understand their possible impacts on the real estate sector of Malaysia with an aim to help stakeholders to adopt necessary responses to reduce negative impacts.Design/methodology/approachAvailable literature is reviewed and data related to climatic influences on buildings and structures are analysed to understand the climate change impacts on real estate in Malaysia.FindingsThe study reveals that temperature in the Peninsular Malaysia will increase by 1.1 to 3.6\u00b0C, rainfall will be more variable and river discharge in some river basins will increase up to 43 per cent during the northeast monsoon season by the end of this century. These changes in turn will pose risks of property damage and increase property lifecycle costs. Furthermore, property prices and the overall growth of the property sector may be affected by the government policy of GHG emission reduction by up to 45 per cent by the year 2030. This study concludes that the property sector of Malaysia will be most affected by the implementation of GHG emission reduction policy in the short term and due to the physical risk posed by variable climate and related extremes in the long term.Originality/valueThe study in general will assist in guiding the operational responses of various authorities, especially in terms of those interventions aimed at climate change risk reduction in the property sector of Malaysia.",

        "abstract": "PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to develop a statistical-based model to forecast future domestic water demand in the context of climate change, population growth and technological development in Yellow River.Design/methodology/approachThe model is developed through the analysis of the effects of climate variables and population on domestic water use in eight sub-basins of the Yellow River. The model is then used to forecast water demand under different environment change scenarios.FindingsThe model projected an increase in domestic water demand in the Yellow River basin in the range of 67.85 \u00d7 108 to 62.20 \u00d7 108 m3 in year 2020 and between 73.32 \u00d7 108 and 89.27 \u00d7 108 m3 in year 2030. The general circulation model Beijing Normal University-Earth System Model (BNU-ESM) predicted the highest increase in water demand in both 2020 and 2030, while Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques Climate Model v.5 (CNRM-CM5) and Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate- Earth System (MIROC-ESM) projected the lowest increase in demand in 2020 and 2030, respectively. The fastest growth in water demand is found in the region where water demand is already very high, which may cause serious water shortage and conflicts among water users.Originality/valueThe simple regression-based domestic water demand model proposed in the study can be used for rapid evaluation of possible changes in domestic water demand due to environmental changes to aid in adaptation and mitigation planning.",

        "abstract": "Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries of the world to temperature extremes due to its predominant arid climate and geographic location in the fast temperature rising zone. Spatial distribution of the trends in annual and seasonal temperatures and temperature extremes over Pakistan has been assessed in this study. The gauge-based gridded daily temperature data of Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) having a spatial resolution of 1\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00b0 was used for the assessment of trends over the period 1960\u20132013 using modified Mann-Kendall test (MMK), which can discriminate the multi-decadal oscillatory variations from secular trends. The results show an increase in the annual average of daily maximum and minimum temperatures in 92 and 99% area of Pakistan respectively at 95% level of confidence. The annual temperature is increasing faster in southern high-temperature region compared to other parts of the country. The minimum temperature is rising faster (0.17\u20130.37\u00a0\u00b0C/decade) compared to maximum temperature (0.17\u20130.29\u00a0\u00b0C/decade) and therefore declination of diurnal temperature range (DTR) (\u2212\u00a00.15 to \u2212\u00a00.08\u00a0\u00b0C/decade) in some regions. The annual numbers of both hot and cold days are increasing in whole Pakistan except in the northern sub-Himalayan region. Heat waves are on the rise, especially in the hot Sindh plains and the Southern coastal region, while the cold waves are becoming lesser in the northern cold region. Obtained results contradict with the findings of previous studies on temperature trends, which indicate the need for reassessment of climatic trends in Pakistan using the MMK test to understand the anthropogenic impacts of climate change.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A model output statistics (MOS) downscaling approach based on support vector machine (SVM) is proposed in this study for the projection of spatial and temporal changes in rainfall of Bangladesh. A combination of past performance assessment and envelope-based methods is used for the selection of GCM ensemble from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Gauge-based gridded monthly rainfall data of Global Precipitation Climatological Center (GPCC) is used as a reference for downscaling and projection of GCM rainfall at regular grid intervals. The obtained results reveal the ability of SVM-based MOS models to replicate the temporal variation and distribution of GPCC rainfall efficiently. The ensemble mean of selected GCM projections downscaled using MOS models show changes in annual precipitation in the range of \u22124.2% to 24.6% in Bangladesh under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios. Annual rainfalls are projected to increase more in the western part (5.1% to 24.6%) where average annual rainfall is relatively low, and less in the eastern part (\u22124.2 to 12.4%) where average annual rainfall is relatively high, which indicates more homogeneity in the spatial distribution of rainfall in Bangladesh in future. A higher increase in rainfall is projected during monsoon compared to other seasons, which indicates more concentration of rainfall in Bangladesh during monsoon.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A hybrid approach by combining the past performance and the envelope methods has been proposed for the selection of an ensemble of general circulation models (GCMs) of Couple Model Intercomparison phase 5 (CMIP5) for the projection of spatiotemporal changes in annual and seasonal temperatures of Iraq for four representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios. A filter known as Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) was used to rank the GCMs considering their ability to simulate monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature for the historical period (1961\u20132005). The highest rank GCMs that represents the widest range of projection was then selected for the projection of temperature through statistical downscaling. A linear bias correction approach was used for the downscaling of temperature, a random forest regression was used to generate multi-model ensemble (MME) mean of projections and a quantile regression (QR) was used to assess the trends in projections at 95% level of confidence. Four GCMs namely, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5 and MIROC-ESM were found most suitable for projection of temperature of Iraq. Ensemble mean of the selected GCMs revealed increases in minimum temperatures in the range of 1.5\u20132.4\u202f\u00b0C, 1.6\u20133.6\u202f\u00b0C, 1.2\u20134.2\u202f\u00b0C, and 1.3\u20136.2\u202f\u00b0C and maximum temperatures in the range of 1.7\u20132.9\u202f\u00b0C, 1.8\u20134.4\u202f\u00b0C, 1.5\u20134.9\u202f\u00b0C, and 1.7\u20136.8\u202f\u00b0C under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively during 2070\u20132099. Higher increases in temperatures were projected in the north and northeast of Iraq where the average temperature is usually low, which indicates that spatial distribution of temperature would be more homogeneous in future compared to base years. The maximum temperature was found to increase more in winter while the minimum in summer. The quantile regression revealed that average summer maximum temperature may reach almost 50\u202f\u00b0C, while the sub-zero temperature will gradually become rare during winter.",

An approach based on compromise programing (CP) is proposed to select the gridded precipitation data for Iraq, where precipitation gauges are very sparse. The performance of seven widely used gauge-based, reanalysis and remote sensing-based gridded monthly precipitation data were assessed using observed precipitation records of 41 stations located within and surrounding Iraq. Obtained results showed the superiority of different datasets in term of different statistical metrics, namely percentage of bias, normalized root-mean-square error, Nash-Sutcliff efficiency, modified index of agreement, volumetric efficiency, and skill score. However, combining all the indices using CP, the gauge-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) precipitation data was found best in term of replicating observed precipitation at 21 out of 41 stations. Validation of results using different approaches revealed that the GPCC precipitation was able to replicate annual and seasonal mean and variability and probability distribution of observed precipitation. The study concludes that CP can be used to select appropriate gridded precipitation data by avoiding confusion arise from contradictory results obtained using different statistical metrics.",

        "abstract": "Homogeneity evaluations are usually performed on the total annual precipitation data, which often fails to detect non-homogeneity in seasonal precipitation. Furthermore, it is required to assess homogeneity using multiple methods as the performance of homogeneity testing methods depend on the distribution of the data. This is particularly important for the arid region where distributions of seasonal and annual rainfall are often non-normal. The homogeneity of annual and monthly precipitation datasets of 14 meteorological stations located in the arid region of Pakistan was assessed in this study using the Pettitt\u2019s test, the standard normal homogeneity test (SNHT), the cumulative deviation test, the von Neumann\u2019s ratio test, the Bayesian test, the Worsley\u2019s likelihood ratio test, and Student\u2019s  t -test at a 95% confidence level. The rainfall series were categorized into three classes, namely \u201cuseful\u201d, \u201cdoubtful\u201d and \u201csuspect\u201d based on the results of different homogeneity tests. Results suggest that rainfall time series for most of the months in all the stations are useful. The rainfall time series are found doubtful for the month of June at two stations, for April at one station, and suspect for November at only one station. On the other hand, the annual series were found useful at 12 stations and suspect at two stations. Comparison of different homogeneity tests revealed that SNHT and Worsley\u2019s tests are the most sensitive, and cumulative deviation test is the least sensitive to changes in monthly precipitation data. In the case of annual series, the von Neumann\u2019s test was found most sensitive compared to other tests.",

        "abstract": "The rough topography, harsh climate, and sparse monitoring stations have limited hydro-climatological studies in arid regions of Pakistan. Gauge-based gridded precipitation datasets provide an opportunity to assess the climate where stations are sparsely located. Though, the reliability of these datasets heavily depends on their ability to replicate the observed temporal variability and distribution patterns. Conventional correlation or error analyses are often not enough to justify the variability and distribution of precipitation. In the present study, mean bias error, mean absolute error, modified index of agreement, and Anderson\u2013Darling test have been used to evaluate the performance of four widely used gauge-based gridded precipitation data products, namely, Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Climatic Research Unit (CRU); Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration towards Evaluation (APHRODITE), Center for Climatic Research\u2014University of Delaware (UDel) at stations located in semi-arid, arid, and hyper-arid regions in the Balochistan province of Pakistan. The result revealed that the performance of different products varies with climate. However, GPCC precipitation data was found to perform much better in all climatic regions in terms of most of the statistical assessments conducted. As the temporal variability and distribution of precipitation are very important in many hydrological and climatic applications, it can be expected that the methods used in this study can be useful for the better assessment of gauge-based data for various applications.",

Bangladesh is considered as the case study area where changes in rainfall are the highest concern due to global warming-induced climate change. The evaluation was based on the ability of the gridded data to estimate the spatial patterns of the magnitude and significance of annual and seasonal rainfall trends estimated using Mann\u2013Kendall (MK) and modified MK (mMK) tests at 34 gauges. A set of statistical indices including Kling\u2013Gupta efficiency, modified index of agreement (md), skill score (SS), and Jaccard similarity index (JSI) were used. The results showed a large variation in the spatial patterns of rainfall trends obtained using different gridded datasets. Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data was found to be the most suitable rainfall data for the assessment of annual and seasonal rainfall trends in Bangladesh which showed a JSI, md, and SS of 22%, 0.61, and 0.73, respectively, when compared with the observed annual trend. Assessment of long-term trend in rainfall (1901\u20132017) using mMK test revealed no change in annual rainfall and changes in seasonal rainfall only at a few grid points in Bangladesh over the last century.",

Catastrophe theory-based weighting method was used to estimate drought hazard, exposure, and risk by avoiding potential human bias. Ten major crops, including eight different types of rice, wheat, and potato, were selected for evaluation of drought risk. Results showed that 32.4%, 27.2%, and 16.2% of land in Bangladesh is prone to extreme Kharif (May-October), Rabi (November-April), and pre-Kharif (March-May) droughts, respectively. Among the major crops, Hybrid Boro rice cultivated in 18.2% of the area is found to be highly vulnerable to droughts, which is followed by High Yield Varity (HYV) Boro (16.9%), Transplant Aman (16.4%), HYV Aman (14.1%), and Basic Aman (12.4%) rice. Hybrid Boro rice in 12 districts, different varieties of Aman rice in 10 districts, and HYV Boro rice in 9 districts, mostly located in the north and northwest of Bangladesh, are exposed to high risk of droughts. High frequency of droughts and use of more land for agriculture have made the region highly prone to droughts. The methodology adopted in this study can be utilized for unbiased estimation of drought risk in agriculture in order to adopt necessary risk reduction measures.",

        "abstract": "Changes in bioclimatic indicators can provide valuable information on how global warming induced climate change can affect humans, ecology and the environment. Trends in thermal bioclimatic indicators over the diverse climate of Iran were assessed in this study to comprehend their spatio-temporal changes in different climates. The gridded temperature data of Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing with a spatial resolution of 0.25\u00b0 and temporal extent of 1948\u20132010 was used for this purpose. Autocorrelation and wavelets analyses were conducted to assess the presence of self-similarity and cycles in the data series. The modified version of the Mann\u2013Kendall (MMK) test was employed to estimate unidirectional trends in 11 thermal bioclimatic indicators through removing the influence of natural cycles on trend significance. A large decrease in the number of grid points showing significant trends was noticed for the MMK in respect to the classical Mann\u2013Kendall (MK) test which indicates that the natural variability of the climate should be taken into consideration in bioclimatic trend analyses in Iran. The unidirectional trends obtained using the MMK test revealed changes in almost all of the bioclimatic indicators in different parts of Iran, which indicates rising temperature have significantly affected the bioclimate of the country. The semi-dry region along the Persian Gulf in the south and mountainous region in the northeast were found to be more affected in terms of the changes in a number of bioclimatic indicators.",

Trends in climate and climate-related extreme events in five major cities have been analyzed in this paper to decipher the variability and ongoing changes in urban Bangladesh. An analysis of 55\u00a0years (1958\u20132012) of daily rainfall and temperature data using nonparametric statistical methods shows a significant increase in annual and seasonal mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures in all five cities. A significant increase in climate-related extreme events, such as heavy rainfall events (>20\u00a0mm), hot days (>32\u00a0\u00b0C) and hot nights (>25\u00a0\u00b0C), is also observed. Climate model results suggest that these trends will continue through the twenty-first century. Vulnerability of urban livelihoods and physical structures to climate change is estimated by considering certainty and timing of impacts. It has been predicted that public health and urban infrastructures, viz. water and power supply, would be the imminent affected sectors in the urban areas of Bangladesh. Adaptation measures that can be adopted to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change are also discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "Droughts are usually destructive when they coincide with crop growing season. Cross-seasonal drought characterization can better inform drought mitigation efforts. The present study relies on precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre to reconstruct historical droughts during different climatic seasons in Balochistan province, Pakistan. We identified seasonal drought events based on the standardized precipitation index for each season. The distribution of reconstructed drought events was analyzed to determine their seasonality and to calculate their return periods. Using these return periods, we constructed seasonal drought maps. The study revealed that early winter droughts are frequent in the north of Balochistan, where the return periods of moderate, severe, and extreme droughts are 7, 21, and 55\u00a0years, respectively. Severe and extreme late winter droughts are more frequent in the upper north, with return periods of 16 and 35\u00a0years, respectively. Early summer droughts occur more frequently in the east, returning every 8, 20, and 60\u00a0years; late summer droughts occur in the northeast, with moderate, severe, and extreme droughts returning every 8, 22, and 65\u00a0years, respectively. Rabi droughts are more frequently in the central and northeaster regions of Balochistan, while more severe kharif droughts occur primarily in the eastern regions. These seasonal droughts were found to be positively correlated with variations in the seasonal rainfall throughout the study area. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of seasonal drought characteristics and help to inform drought mitigation planning.",

        "abstract": "With enhanced economic development and population growth in recent years, total water consumption has increased significantly around the world. As the most populated and most rapidly developing country in the world, one of the major challenges for the Chinese government is to guarantee a continuous water supply to improve the livelihood of the growing population and maintain the fast development of the economy. An ever-increasing trend of water consumption has led to the construction of hydraulic structures and degradation of the ecosystem in China. Through the analysis of water consumption and water-use efficiency around the world, this study concluded that water demand management is the only option to assure a continuous supply of water to a growing population and developing economy. In this paper, water supply and demand of China over the time period 1980\u20132009 are analyzed to formulate water demand management strategies for a sustainable water supply. The study proposes that a water demand management strategy, based on demand control and quota management, could be a better option for sustainable water management in China. An example of the Haihe River Basin is provided to show the success of water demand management using total demand control and quota management. It can be expected that through the encouragement of a water conserving society, by water demand management, it is possible to harmonize the relationship among water, the environment, ecosystems, and human beings in China.",

        "abstract": "This article examines data from the Shihuiyao, Nierji, Tongmeng, Jiangqiao, and Dalai hydrological stations in the Nen River basin to understand the hydrological processes occurring in the catchments. Daily precipitation and runoff data from 1955 to 1973 were combined using the smoothed minima trial method to determine the surface runoff concentration time. Then, a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the parameters and obtain an optimal empirical formula. An improved empirical formula was implemented with the genetic algorithm and optimized parameters then incorporated variable average rainfall intensity, correlation between basin area, surface runoff average concentration time, and average rainfall intensity. Finally, an optimized empirical formula (using genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters) and improved empirical formula (incorporating variable average rainfall intensity) were tested by using the daily precipitation and runoff data from the Baishan and Hongshi hydrological stations of the Second Songhua River. The results show that an optimized and improved formula can be used to more accurately estimate hydrologic conditions in the Nen River. Therefore, the improved formula is an efficient method for calculating surface runoff concentration time. Surface runoff concentration time is an important basis for differentiating source waters, which include surface runoff and underground runoff.",

        "abstract": "With the growth of population and economy, water demand has increased significantly in all the over world. However, the water consumptions in Haihe River basin located in the Northern part of China has decreased in recent years. Haihe River basin, covers the provinces of Beijing and Tianjin and parts of other six provinces of China is considered as the center of politics, economics, and cultural of China. Therefore, decreasing water demand in Haihe River basin has attracted the attention of hydrologists and decision makers. A study has been carried out in this paper by using information entropy theory to understand the possible causes of changing water consumptions in Haihe River basin. Results show that entropy value of water consumption system of Haihe River basin has increased from 0.72 in 1980 to 0.91 in 2008. The balance degree of water consumptions has also increased from 0.68 in 1980 to 0.89 in 2008. The results indicate that the water consumption structure of the basin has become more stable with time. The dominance of agricultural water consumption has weakened, the industrial consumption has stabled, and the domestic and ecological water consumptions have increased. The study reveals that land conversion from agrarian to industrial and higher water efficiency in industrial production have reduced the total water consumption in the basin. Water management approaches base on total quantity control and quota management have been proposed in this study for further reduction of water demand in the basin.",

        "abstract": "Water scarcity in China would possibly be aggravated by rapid increase in water demand for irrigation due to climate change. This paper focuses on the mechanism of climate change impact on regional irrigation water demand by considering the dynamic feedback relationships among climate change, irrigation water demand and adaptation measures. The model in implemented using system dynamics approach and employed in Baojixia irrigation district located in Shaanxi Province of China to analyses the changes in irrigation water demand under different climate change scenarios. Obtained results revealed that temperature will be the dominant factor to determine irrigation water demand in the area. An increase of temperature by 1\u00a0\u00b0C will result in net irrigation water demand to increase by about 12,050\u2009\u00d7\u2009104\u00a0m3 and gross water demand by about 20,080\u2009\u00d7\u2009104\u00a0m3 in the area. However, irrigation water demand will not increase at the same rate of temperature rise as the adaptation measures will eventually reduce the water demand increased by temperature rise. It is expected that the modeling approach presented in this study can be used in adopting policy responses to reduce climate change impacts on water resources.",

A review summarising the findings related to climate change impacts on water demand is carried out in this article. A water management strategy is also proposed, which would help with adaptation to growing pressure on water resources due to climate change and socio-economic development. The study reveals that climate change will increase global water demand, though this will vary widely with geographic location and climatic conditions. Water demand in agriculture will be affected more heavily than will demands in other sectors. As irrigation comprises the major portion of global consumptive water use, increased water demand in irrigation may cause severe stress on water resources. Studies suggest that water demand management or water supply management alone will not able to adapt to mounting water stress. A combination of both water supply and water demand management strategies is necessary in order to adapt to varying environmental and associated uncertainties. A case study from the Haihe River basin of China is presented, to illustrate the effectiveness of water demand management strategies used alongside water supply management in adapting to environmental changes. It is expected that the study will help guide policy responses, with the goal of mitigating the impacts of climate change on water resources.",

        "abstract": "This study examined hydrological and meteorological changes in China\u2019s Nenjiang River Basin. Taking account of the physical processes in hydrology and meteorology revealed by the hydrological elements, we selected typical periods and sites for analysis on temperature (1951\u20132004), precipitation, and runoff data (1955\u20132005). Through some methods including improved cumulative curve method, the Sen slope estimation method, Mann-Kendall non-parametric test analysis, the Pettitt mutation point test and Spearman rank correlation test, and the spatiotemporal characteristics of hydrological and meteorological elements were evaluated. An innovative concept of the \u201ccentroid of precipitation\u201d was proposed to analyze the spatial evolution tendency of precipitation. The results are concluded as follows: (1) the temperature began to show a rising trend during the 1960s and 1970s in Nenjiang River Basin in the twentieth century. The temperature had risen significantly by the 1990s. Furthermore, the temperature increased significantly at the coldest place and in the coldest month. (2) There was no significant trend change in the annual precipitation in the Nenjiang River Basin. However, monthly precipitation before the flood season (April) and after the flood season (October) exhibited a significant upward trend. The centroid of precipitation was concentrated in a compact spatial distribution in the main flood season but was dispersed relatively in the other months. (3) River runoff showed a downward trend year by year and exhibited a mutation in 1979. The spatial variation in runoff showed that the fluctuation of downstream runoff was greater than that in the upper reaches of the basin and that the runoff from the upstream to the downstream reaches gradually decreased. According to the M-K mutation point test, the Pettitt mutation point test, and the improved cumulative curve method, a mutation in annual runoff sequence occurred in 1979. These findings will be helpful for understanding evolution of hydrological changes and will be supportive for local water managers to deal with changing climate.",

        "abstract": "The calculation of hydrologic frequency is an important basic step in the planning and design stage of any water conservancy project. The purpose of the frequency analysis is to deduce the hydrologic variables under different guarantee rates, and to provide hydrologic information for water conservancy project planning and design. The calculation of hydrologic frequency requires that the sample size is large enough, as only then can the statistical characteristics of samples take the place of the total statistical eigenvalues. This means that the samples can reveal the statistical characteristics of hydrologic variables and identify the randomness rule of hydrologic phenomena. Many countries in the East Asian monsoon climate zone (China, Japan and South Korea) have stipulated a sample size of 30 years for hydrologic frequency analysis. In this paper the rationality of the 30-year sample size is proved by analyzing the periodic and random rules of hydrologic phenomenon and the influencing mechanism of solar activity, and by adopting the general conclusion of the sampling theorem. Then, using the wavelet analysis method to examine annual precipitation data in a long series generated from representative precipitation observation stations in China, the strong-weak cycle of solar activity is proved to be 10 years, which is consistent with the wet-dry cycle of the representative precipitation stations (10\u201312 years). Finally, adopting numerical modeling to analyze the normal distribution of randomly generated samples and long-range annual precipitation data collected from representative stations, hypothesis testing (u, F and t) is used to prove that a 30-year sample size is reasonable. This research provides a reference as to how to prove the necessary sample size for relevant statistical analyses (for example, how large the sample should be for analyzing hydrologic factors trend evolution, hydrologic data consistency and ergodicity of statistical samples), thus ensuring the reliability of the analytical results.",

The results reveal that with increasing Ce concentration from 0 to 0.125g/L in the electrolytes, electrical conductivity of the electrolytes is increased from 15.15 MS/cm to 16.54 MS/cm, meanwhile, current in micro-arc oxidation process is obviously varied also. With increasing in Ce concentration in the electrolytes, coating thickness and micro-hardness are firstly increased then gradually decreased, in which the coating thickness of approximately 258\u03bcm and coating micro-hardness of HV620 can be obtained with 0.025g/L Ce concentration.",

        "abstract": "The influence of stirring parameters (stirring temperature, stirring speed and stirring time) on the particle distribution of 10%(volume fraction) SiC particulate reinforced AZ91 composites (SiCp/AZ91) was studied. It is found that it is necessary for 10\u03bcm SiC particulate reinforced AZ91 composites to stir the molten composites in semi-solid condition with vortex formation, or else the cluster of the reinforcements would not be eliminated. Compared with the monolithic alloy, the SiCp/AZ91 composite has higher strength, especially for yield strength, but the elongation is reduced. For the as-cast composite, the particles often segregate within the grain boundary regions. Extrusion can effectively reduce the segregation of SiC particles and improve the mechanical properties of the composite. The extrusion-induced reduction in particle size varies with extrusion temperatures and extrusion ratios. The effect of extrusion-induced reduction in particle size on the mechanical properties of the composites is not always beneficial.",

The co-culture showed higher efficiency for removing total organic carbon (TOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) than strain GA or GP cultured separately. The inoculation ratio of 50 (strain GA/GP) was advantageous for the TOC and TDN removal efficiencies of the co-culture. The sequential co-culture tests showed that strain GP being inoculated after strain GA was inoculated for 36 h increased the TDN removal efficiency from 53.3% to 86.8%. This finding indicated that the activity of strain GA was important in the co-culture system, and the sequential co-culture could be advantageous to the synergistic effect of strains GA and GP. The co-culture of different functional bacteria can be an alternative method for improving the performance of aerobic denitrifying microorganisms for pollutant removal.",

        "abstract": "Intensive nitrous oxide (NO) emissions usually occur at the working face of landfills. However, the specific amounts and contributions of the multiple pathways to NO emissions are poorly understood. NO emissions and the mutual conversions of N-species in both open and sealed simulated landfill reactors filled with fresh refuse were examined during a 100-h incubation period, and NO sources were calculated using N isotope labelling. NO peak fluxes were above 70\u03bcgNkg waste h for both treatments. The sealed incubation reactors became a NO sink when NO in the ambient environment was sufficient. The total amount of NO emissions under sealed conditions was 2.15\u00b10.56mgNkg waste, which was higher than that under open conditions (1.91\u00b10.34mgNkg waste). The NO peak appeared prior to the peak in NO flux. The degree and duration of total nitrogen reduction in open incubations were larger and longer than those of sealed incubations and could possibly be due to oxygen supplementation. Denitrification (DF) was a major source of NO generation during these incubations. The contribution of the DF pathway decreased from 89.2% to 61.3% during the open incubations. The effects of nitrification (NF) and nitrification-coupled denitrification (NCD) increased during the increasing phase and the decreasing phase of NO flux, contributing 24.1-37.4% and 31.7-34.4% of total NO emissions, respectively. In sealed treatments, the DF pathway accounted for more than 90% of the total NO emission during the entire incubation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Fluidized bed reactor (FBR) has been applied in phosphorus recovery from wastewater due to its ability on producing struvite pellets with large size, high crushing strength and purity. However, the fine struvite crystals (fines) can be flushed out of the reactor, which may result in undesirable and variable phosphorus recovery efficiencies. In this study, the influences of key factors with respect to phosphorus recovery and product quality in a FBR were investigated for the treatment of swine wastewater. The effects of process parameters were first evaluated using response surface methodology (RSM), and later, long-term pilot-scale operations were tested. Results showed that fines retention was directly related to the in-reactor saturation index (SI) and upflow velocity (v up ). Decreasing SI (from 2.42 to 1.65) or v up  (from 75 to 25\u00a0mm\u00a0s \u2212\u00a01 ) will reduce the fines entrainment and improve the phosphorus recovery profile by 14.9 and 18.5%, respectively. Moreover, these two factors governed the quality of the struvite pellets in the pilot-scale investigations\u2014SI showed more crucial effect to size distribution, crushing strength and morphology than v up . As to the composition, struvite (35.5\u201395.3% of mass fraction) and CaCO 3  (2.8 to 51.4% of mass fraction) were the two major components in the pellets. Decreasing SI or increasing v up  and pellet size can enhance the struvite purity. Therefore, phosphorus recovery and pellet quality can be simultaneously improved by SI and v up  control without additional trapping devices or reagents. The finding is constructive for FBR system set-up and operation in either pilot- or full-scale applications, where different phosphorus recovery rates and product qualities are required.",

Results showed that N-removal efficiency increased with increasing organic substrate, while the anammox contribution to N-removal decreased as confirmed by isotope labelling technique. Excessively high TN (total nitrogen) concentrations were detrimental to N-removal, and TN of 600 mg L was optimized. Specific COD of 300 mg L (a threshold value above which anammox was less active) was synergistic for N-removal. Moreover, Illumina sequencing and qPCR techniques uncovered that while the microbial community composition was relatively stable for all treatments, abundances of denitrifier were positively correlated with increase of COD, which was counter-productive for anammox abundance. Structure equation model indicated that COD was more important with respect to maintain the anammox stability than the COD/N ratio. Furthermore, experiment and model fittings revealed that anammox contributed more than 80% of N-removal when COD was below 55.7 mg L, and approximately 50% at 220-300\u2009mg L COD, respectively. These data formed a reference for regulation of anammox systems in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Landfilling biodegradable waste is an important source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Among the several types of landfill, limited-controlled landfill is a common method used to dispose of domestic solid waste, especially in developing countries. However, information about GHG emissions from limited-controlled landfill sites has rarely been reported. In this study, the GHG emissions from a typical limited-controlled landfill site were investigated under a regular period for one year. The number and positions of static chambers were arranged according to the guidance on Monitoring Landfill Gas Surface Emissions by the UK Environment Agency to obtain representative data from the heterogeneous surface of the landfill. Inverse distance weighting (IDW) was applied to evaluate and visualise the GHG emissions from the whole landfill surface based on the measurements of distributed static chambers. As an important GHG source of the landfill site, the emissions from the landfill leachate treatment plant were also measured. The results revealed that CH and NO emission fluxes from the landfill area were 1324.73\u202f\u00b1\u202f2005.17\u202fmg C m d and 2.16\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.33\u202fmg\u202fN\u202fm d, respectively, and the fluxes from the leachate treatment plants were 23.92\u202f\u00b1\u202f29.20\u202fmg C m d and 16.40\u202f\u00b1\u202f16.89\u202fmg\u202fN\u202fm d, respectively. CH and NO releases preferred to present spatial heterogeneity, while temporal heterogeneity was expected to exist in CH and CO emissions. The annual GHG emissions from the limited-controlled landfill was calculated to be 1.078 Gg CO-eq\u202fyr, which was the least among all types of landfill sites. In addition, the GHG emission factor was 0.042\u202ft CO-eq\u202ft waste yr which could not be ignored compared to the sanitary landfills. Therefore, it is advisable to give more attention and determine a potential solution for reducing GHG emissions from limited-controlled landfill sites.",

The results showed that the 5% and 10% treatments were able to maintain continuous thermophilic conditions, while the 15% treatment performed badly in regard to composting temperature, which was probably due to the negative effects of excessive moisture on microbial activity. As composting proceeded, both the 5% and the 10% treatments reached maturity and achieved weight losses of approximately 65%. High-throughput sequencing results indicated that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla of the community structure. The communities sampled at the thermophilic phases had high similarity and relatively low diversity, while species diversity increased in the maturity phase.

        "abstract": "To investigate the effects of temperature shock on NO emissions, four treatments with rapidly changing incubation temperature from the control (20\u202f\u00b0C) to 4, 12, 25, or 34\u202f\u00b0C were conducted. Results showed that higher NO emissions (0.023-0.37%) were observed when reactor contents received temperature shocks. NO emissions increased as the temperature interval increased. Nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide reduction rates generally followed the order: 34\u202f\u00b0C\u202f>\u202f25\u202f\u00b0C\u202f>\u202f20\u202f\u00b0C\u202f>\u202f12\u202f\u00b0C\u202f>\u202f4\u00b0C. Overall, the low-temperature shocks down-regulated and high-temperature shocks up-regulated the expression of denitrifying genes. However, the transcription rate of norB/nosZ and nirS/nosZ could not explain higher NO emission. The increased NO emissions might be more related to post-transcriptional regulation and enzyme activity (Q value). The results of cDNA sequencing showed that the active microbial community was relatively stable. Among the members of top 15 genera with active transcripts, Flavobacterium, Comamonadaceae and Xanthomonadales were the dominant denitrifying bacteria.",

        "abstract": "The importance of methane (CH) emissions from landfills has been extensively documented, while the nitrous oxide (NO) emissions from landfills are considered negligible. In this study, three landfills were selected to measure CH and NO emissions using the static chamber method. Dongbu (DB) and Dongfu (DF) landfills, both located in Xiamen city, Fujian Province, were classified as sanitary. The former started to receive solid waste from Xiamen city in 2009, and the latter was closed in 2009. Nanjing (NJ) landfill, located in Nanjing county, Fujian Province, was classified as managed. Results showed that for the landfill reservoirs, CH emissions were significant, while NO emissions occurred mainly in operating areas (on average, 16.3 and 19.0mgNOmh for DB and NJ landfills, respectively) and made a negligible contribution to the total greenhouse gas emissions in term of CO equivalent. However, significant NO emissions were observed in the leachate treatment systems of sanitary landfills and contributed 72.8% and 45.6% of total emissions in term of CO equivalent in DB and DF landfills, respectively. The NO emission factor (EF) of the leachate treatment systems was in the range of 8.9-11.9% of the removed nitrogen. The total NO emissions from the leachate treatment systems of landfills in Xiamen city were estimated to be as high as 8.55gNO-Ncapitayr. These results indicated that NO emissions from leachate treatment systems of sanitary landfills were not negligible and should be included in national and/or local inventories of greenhouse gas emissions.",

        "abstract": "Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a member of the genus Lentivirus of the family Retroviridae. Horses are the most susceptible equids to EIAV infection and are therefore the primary hosts of this virus. In contrast, infected donkeys do not develop clinically active equine infectious anemia (EIA). This phenomenon is similar to what has been observed with HIV-1, which fails to induce AIDS in non-human primates. Interestingly, Shen et al. developed a donkey-tropic pathogenic virus strain (EIAVDV117, DV117) by serially passaging a horse-tropic pathogenic strain, EIAVLN40 (LN40), in donkeys. LN40, which was generated by passaging a field isolate in horses, displayed enhanced virulence in horses but caused no clinical symptoms in donkeys. Infection with DV117 induced acute EIA in nearly 100\u00a0% of donkeys. Genomic analysis of DV117 revealed a significantly higher frequency of A-to-G substitutions when compared to LN40. Furthermore, detailed analysis of dinucleotide editing showed that A-to-G mutations had a preference for 5'TpA and 5'ApA. These results strongly implicated the activity of the adenosine deaminase, ADAR1, in this type of mutation. Further investigation demonstrated that overexpression of donkey ADAR1 increased A-to-G mutations within the genome of EIAV. Together with our previous finding that multiple mutations in multiple genes are generated in DV117 during its adaptation from horses to donkeys, the present study suggests that ADAR1-induced A-to-G mutations occur during virus adaption to related new hosts contributing to the alteration of EIAV host tropism.

        "abstract": "Gag intracellular assembly and export are very important processes for lentiviruses replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) matrix (MA) possesses distinct phosphoinositide affinity compared with HIV-1 MA and that phosphoinositide-mediated targeting to peripheral and internal membranes is a critical factor in EIAV assembly and release. In this study, we compared the cellular assembly sites of EIAV and HIV-1. We observed that the assembly of EIAV particles occurred on interior cellular membranes, while HIV-1 was targeted to the plasma membrane (PM) for assembly. Then, we determined that W7 and K9 in the EIAV MA N terminus were essential for Gag assembly and release but did not affect the cellular distribution of Gag. The replacement of EIAV MA with HIV-1 MA directed chimeric Gag to the PM but severely impaired Gag release. MA structural analysis indicated that the EIAV and HIV-1 MAs had similar spatial structures but that helix 1 of the EIAV MA was closer to loop 2. Further investigation indicated that EIAV Gag accumulated in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) but not the early and late endosomes. The 9 N-terminal amino acids of EIAV MA harbored the signal that directed Gag to the TGN membrane system. Additionally, we demonstrated that EIAV particles were transported to the extracellular space by the cellular vesicle system. This type of EIAV export was not associated with multivesicular bodies or microtubule depolymerization but could be inhibited by the actin-depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D, suggesting that dynamic actin depolymerization may be associated with EIAV production.IMPORTANCE In previous studies, EIAV Gag was reported to localize to both the cell interior and the plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate that EIAV likely uses the TGN as the assembly site in contrast to HIV-1, which is targeted to the PM for assembly. These distinct assembly features are determined by the MA domain. We also identified two sites in the N terminus of EIAV MA that were important for Gag assembly and release. Furthermore, the observation of EIAV transport by cellular vesicles but not by multivesicular bodies sheds light on the mechanisms underlying EIAV cellular replication.",

        "abstract": "The polymerase of the influenza virus is part of the key machinery necessary for viral replication. However, the avian influenza virus polymerase is restricted in mammalian cells. The cellular protein ANP32A has been recently found to interact with viral polymerase, and to both influence polymerase activity and interspecies restriction. Here we report that either human ANP32A or ANP32B is indispensable for human influenza A virus RNA replication. The contribution of huANP32B is equal to that of huANP32A, and together they play a fundamental role in the activity of human influenza A virus polymerase, while neither human ANP32A nor ANP32B support the activity of avian viral polymerase. Interestingly, we found that avian ANP32B was naturally inactive, leaving avian ANP32A alone to support viral replication. Two amino acid mutations at sites 129-130 in chicken ANP32B lead to the loss of support of viral replication and weak interaction with the viral polymerase complex, and these amino acids are also crucial in the maintenance of viral polymerase activity in other ANP32 proteins. Our findings strongly support ANP32A&B as key factors for both virus replication and adaption. The key host factors involved in the influenza A viral polymerase activity and RNA replication remain largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that ANP32A and ANP32B from different species are powerful factors in the maintenance of viral polymerase activity. Human ANP32A and ANP32B contribute equally to support human influenza virus RNA replication. However, unlike avian ANP32A, the avian ANP32B is evolutionarily non-functional in supporting viral replication because of a 129-130 site mutation. The 129-130 site plays an important role in ANP32A/B and viral polymerase interaction, therefore determine viral replication, suggesting a novel interface as a potential target for the development of anti-influenza strategies.",

        "abstract": "Equine influenza virus (EIV) causes severe acute respiratory disease in horses. Currently, the strains belonging to the H3N8 genotype are divided into two clades, Florida clade 1 (FC1) and Florida clade 2 (FC2) which emerged in 2002. Both FC1and FC2 clades were reported in Asian and Middle East countries in the last decade. In this study, we described the evolution, epidemiology and molecular characteristic of the EIV lineages, with focus on those detected in Asia from 2007 to 2017. The full genome phylogeny showed that FC1 and FC2 constituted separated and divergent lineages, without evidence of reassortment between the clades. While FC1 evolved as a single lineage, the FC2 showed a divergent event around 2004 giving rise to two well supported and coexisting sub-lineages, European and Asian. Furthermore, two different spread patterns of EIV in Asian countries were identified. The FC1 outbreaks were caused by independent introductions of EIV from the Americas, being the Asian isolates genetically similar to the contemporary American lineages. On the other hand, the FC2 strains detected in Asian mainland countries conformed an autochthonous monophyletic group with a common ancestor dated in 2006 and showed evidence of an endemic circulation in local host. Characteristic aminoacidic signature patterns were detected in all viral proteins in both Asian-FC1 and FC2 populations. Several changes were located at the top of the HA1 protein, inside or near to antigenic sites. Further studies are needed to assess the potential impact of these antigenic changes in vaccination programs. The complex and continuous antigenic evolution of EIVs remains a major hurdle for vaccine development and the design of effective immunization programs. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis showing the EIV evolutionary dynamics, including the spread and circulation within the Asian continent and its relationship to global EIV populations over a 10-year period. Moreover, we provide a better understanding of EIV molecular evolution in Asian countries and its consequences on the antigenicity. The study underscores the association between the global horse movement and the circulation of EIV in this region. Understanding EIV evolution is imperative in order to mitigate the risk of outbreaks affecting horse industry and to help with the selection of the viral strains to be included in the formulation of future vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Equine infectious anemia is an important viral infection affecting horses worldwide. Although an effective equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) vaccine has been developed in China, the control of the disease is mainly based on identification of the horses infected by EIAV through laboratory diagnostic tests. The agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on detecting p26 antibodies are widely used, but there is an increasing need for developing a more sensitive diagnostic test utilizing other EIAV proteins. Equine infectious anemia virus glycoprotein gp45 plays a similar role to gp41 in human immunodeficiency virus by mediating virus\u2013host membrane fusion. The gp45 ectodomain was constructed by removal of the disulfide-bond loop region, and the recombinant protein (rgp45) was expressed in  Escherichia coli  followed by purification. An indirect rgp45 ELISA has been established and validated. There was an excellent agreement between the ELISA results using rgp45 and AGID test results. After 546 serum samples were tested, the relative sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 90.0% and 99.3%, respectively. Moreover, this assay showed sufficient reproducibility after detecting intrarun and interrun coefficients of variation. Therefore, this indirect ELISA represents a sensitive and specific quantitative tool for the serologic detection of EIAV to facilitate the prevention and control of this disease. In addition, this method could be applied to evaluate the effective protection of vaccines by detecting neutralizing antibodies to the ectodomain of gp45, which has strong immunity and biological function.",

        "abstract": "Equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are members of the lentiviral genus. Similar to HIV gp41, EIAV gp45 is a fusogenic protein that mediates fusion between the viral particle and the host cell membrane. The crystal structure of gp45 reported reveals a different conformation in the here that includes the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR) and neighboring asparagine-rich layer compared with previous HIV-1 gp41 structures. A complicated hydrogen-bond network containing a cluster of solvent molecules appears to be critical for the stability of the gp45 helical bundle. Interestingly, viral replication was relatively unaffected by site-directed mutagenesis of EIAV, in striking contrast to that of HIV-1. Based on these observations, we speculate that EIAV is more adaptable to emergent mutations, which might be important for the evolution of EIAV as a quasi-species, and could potentially contribute to the success of the EIAV vaccine.",

Deletion or attenuation of the Kozak sequence resulted in expression of an N-terminal 11\u2009 aa-truncated Rev in addition to WT Rev. Truncated Rev displayed weaker promotion of Gag expression and processing than WT Rev. Furthermore, EIAV rescued from an infectious molecular clone (pEIAVUK3) with Kozak attenuation exhibited decreased viral replication in host cells in vitro.

        "abstract": "The nuclear export receptor CRM1 is an important regulator involved in the shuttling of various cellular and viral RNAs between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. HIV-1 Rev interacts with CRM1 in the late phase of HIV-1 replication to promote nuclear export of unspliced and single spliced HIV-1 transcripts. However, the knowledge of cellular factors that are involved in the CRM1-dependent viral RNA nuclear export remains inadequate. Here, we identified that ANP32A and ANP32B mediate the export of unspliced or partially spliced viral mRNA via interacting with Rev and CRM1. We found that double, but not single, knockout of ANP32A and ANP32B, significantly decreased the expression of gag protein. Reconstitution of either ANP32A or ANP32B restored the viral production equally. Disruption of both ANP32A and ANP32B expression led to a dramatic accumulation of unspliced viral mRNA in the nucleus. We further identified that ANP32A and ANP32B interact with both Rev and CRM1 to promote RNA transport and that this function is Rev/RRE-dependent, but not CTE-dependent. Together our data suggests that ANP32A and ANP32B are required for HIV-1 unspliced RNA export in the Rev-CRM1 pathway.",

        "abstract": "Human Myxovirus resistance 2 (huMxB) has been shown to be a determinant type I interferon-induced host factor involved in the inhibition of HIV-1 as well as many other primate lentiviruses. This blocking occurs after the reverse transcription of viral RNA and ahead of the integration into the host DNA, which is closely connected to the ability of the protein to bind the viral capsid. To date, Mx2s derived from non-primate animals have shown no capacity for HIV-1 suppression. In this study, we examined the restrictive effect of equine Mx2 (eqMx2) on both the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and HIV-1 and investigated possible mechanisms for its specific function. We demonstrated that IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 upregulates the expression of eqMx2 in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs). Overexpression of eqMx2 significantly suppresses the replication of EIAV, HIV-1, and SIVs, but not that of MLV. Knockdown of eqMx2 transcription weakens the inhibition of EIAV replication by type I interferon. Interestingly, immunofluorescence assays suggest that the subcellular localization of eqMx2 changes following virus infection, from being dispersed in the cytoplasm to being accumulated at the nuclear envelope. Furthermore, eqMx2 blocks the nuclear uptake of the proviral genome by binding to the viral capsid. The N-truncated mutant of eqMx2 lost the ability to bind the viral capsid as well as the restriction effect for lentiviruses. These results improve our understanding of the Mx2 protein in non-primate animals. Previous research has shown that the antiviral ability of Mx2s is confined to primates, particularly humans. EIAV has been shown to be insensitive to the restriction by human MxB. Here, we described the function of equine Mx2. This protein plays an important role in the suppression of EIAV, HIV-1, and SIVs. The antiviral activity of eqMx2 depends on its subcellular location as well as its capsid binding capacity. Our results showed that following viral infection, eqMx2 changes its original cytoplasmic location and accumulates at the nuclear envelope where it binds to the viral capsid and blocks the nuclear entry of reverse transcribed proviral DNAs. In contrast, huMxB does not bind to the EIAV capsid and shows no EIAV restriction effect. These studies expand our understanding of the function of the equine Mx2 protein.",

        "abstract": "TRIM5\u03b1 is an important host restriction factor which could potently block retrovirus infection. The SPRY domain of TRIM5\u03b1 mediates post-entry restriction by recognition of and binding to the retroviral capsid. Human TRIM5\u03b1 also functions as an innate immune sensor to activate AP-1 and NF-\u03baB signaling, which subsequently restrict virus replication. Previous studies have shown that the AP-1 and NF-\u03baB signaling activation relies on the RING motif of TRIM5\u03b1. In this study, we have demonstrated that the SPRY domain is essential for rhesus macaca TRIM5\u03b1 to activate AP-1, but not NF-\u03baB signaling. The AP-1 activation mainly depends on all the \u03b2-sheet barrel on SPRY structure of TRIM5\u03b1. Furthermore, the SPRY mediated auto-ubiquitination of TRIM5\u03b1 is required for AP-1 activation. This study reports that rhesus macaca TRIM5\u03b1 mainly undergoes Lys27-linked and Met1-linked auto-polyubiquitination. Finally, we found that the TRIM5\u03b1 signaling function was positively correlated with its retroviral restriction activity. This study has discovered an important role of the SPRY domain in immune signaling and antiviral activity and further expanded our knowledge of the antiviral mechanism of TRIM5\u03b1.",

In this process, the ESCRT proteins, ALIX and TSG101, are recruited through interactions with HIV-1 Gag p6. ALG-2, also known as PDCD6, interacts with both ALIX and TSG101 and bridges ESCRT-III and ESCRT-I. In this study, we show that ALG-2 affects HIV-1 production negatively at both the exogenous and endogenous levels. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified HEBP2 as the binding partner of ALG-2, and we solved the crystal structure of the ALG-2\u00b7HEBP2 complex. The function of ALG-2\u00b7HEBP2 complex in HIV-1 replication was further explored. ALG-2 inhibits HIV-1 production by affecting Gag expression and distribution, and HEBP2 might aid this process by tethering ALG-2 in the cytoplasm.",

        "abstract": "Quantitation of virions is one of the important indexes in virological studies. To establish a sensitive and rapid quantitative detection method for equine arteritis virus (EAV), an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (AC-ELISA) was developed by using two EAV nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 2B9 and 2B3, prepared in this study. After condition optimization, mAb 2B9 was used as the capture antibody, and HRP-labeled 2B3 was chosen as the detecting antibody. The AC-ELISA had a good standard curve when viral particles of the Bucyrus EAV strain were used as a reference standard. The detection limit for the Bucyrus EAV strain was 36 PFU, and the method had a good linear relationship between 72-2297 PFU. The AC-ELISA could specifically detect the Bucyrus EAV strain and had no cross-reaction with other equine viruses. The sensitivity of the AC-ELISA was much higher than that of a western blotting assay but lower than that of a real-time PCR method. However, as a quantitative antigen detection method, the sensitivity of the AC-ELISA was approximately 300 times than the western blotting assay. Furthermore, the AC-ELISA assay could be successfully used in quantification of viral content in an in vitro infection assay, such as a one-step growth curve of EAV, as well as in a transfection assay, such as virus rescue from an infectious cDNA clone of EAV. These results show that the AC-ELISA established in this study is a good alternative for antigen detection of EAV, being a simple, convenient and quantitative detection method for EAV antigens.",

        "abstract": "Gag intracellular assembly and export are very important processes for lentiviruses replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) MA possesses distinct phosphoinositide affinity compared with HIV-1 MA and that phosphoinositide-mediated targeting to peripheral and internal membranes is a critical factor in EIAV assembly and release. In this study, we compared the cellular assembly sites of EIAV and HIV-1. We observed that the assembly of EIAV particles occurred on interior cellular membranes, while HIV-1 was targeted to the PM for assembly. Then, we determined that W7 and K9 in the EIAV MA N-terminus were essential for Gag assembly and release but did not affect the cellular distribution of Gag. The replacement of EIAV MA with HIV-1 MA directed chimeric Gag to the PM but severely impaired Gag release. MA structural analysis indicated that the EIAV and HIV-1 MAs had similar spatial structures but that helix 1 of the EIAV MA was closer to loop 2. Further investigation indicated that EIAV Gag accumulated in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) but not the early and late endosomes. The 9 N-terminal amino acids of EIAV MA harbored the signal that directed Gag to the TGN membrane system. Additionally, we demonstrated that EIAV particles were transported to the extracellular space by the cellular vesicle system. This type of EIAV export was not associated with multivesicular bodies (MVBs) or microtubule depolymerization but could be inhibited by the actin-depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D, suggesting that dynamic actin depolymerization may be associated with EIAV production.In previous studies, EIAV Gag was reported to localize to both the cell interior and the plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate that EIAV likely uses the TGN as the assembly site in contrast to HIV-1, which is targeted to the PM for assembly. These distinct assembly features are determined by the MA domain. We also identified two sites in the N-terminus of EIAV MA that were important for Gag assembly and release. Furthermore, the observation of EIAV transport by cellular vesicles but not by MVBs sheds light on the mechanisms underlying EIAV cellular replication.",

Sequencing of the host genomic regions flanking the viral IS showed that reference sequence (RefSeq) genes were preferentially targeted for integration by EIAVDLV121. Introns, AT-rich regions, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and DNA transposons were also predominantly biased toward viral insertion, which is consistent with EIAVFDDV13 integration into the horse genome in FED cells. In addition, the most significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, specifically gag junctions for EIAVDLV121 and tight junctions for EIAVFDDV13, are regulators of metabolic function, which is consistent with the common bioprocesses, specifically cell cycle and chromosome/DNA organization, identified by gene ontology (GO) analysis. Our results demonstrate that EIAV integration occurs in regions that harbour structural and topological features of local chromatin in both macrophages and fibroblasts. Our data on EIAV will facilitate further understanding of lentivirus infection and the development of safer and more effective gene therapy vectors.",

However, achieving multiple colors using a single-molecule material has proved challenging. In this study, a multicolor electrochromic prototype device is generated by integrating medium engineering/in situ \u2018electro base\u2019/laminated electrode technologies with the simple flying fish-shaped methyl ketone TM1. This multicolor electrochromic (green, blue and magenta) device is durable and has a high coloration efficiency (350 cm2 C\u22121), a fast switching time (50 ms) and superior reversibility. This study is a successful attempt to integrate solvatochromism and basochromism in an electronic display. This integration not only introduces a new avenue for color tuning, in addition to the structural design of the colorant, but will also inspire further developments in the tuning of many other properties by this medium engineering approach, such as conductance and the redox property, and thereby accelerate versatile applications in data recording, ultrathin flexible displays, and optical communication and sensing.",

Three single states can be obtained and the switching is unidirectional under the stimulation of acid and base. The electrochromic phenomenon of the molecular switch was demonstrated combining its electro-base property and base-sensitive property.

We discover that energy barrier of C-N bond breaking is reduced dramatically to less than 1/7 (from 40.4 to 5.5 kcal/mol), and 1/3 of the oxidation potential is simultaneously lowered (from 0.67 to 0.43 V) with the oxidation of Rh-N. The concept, cation-coupled electron transfer (CCET), is highly recommended by analyzing existing proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) and metal coupled electron transfer (MCET) along with aforementioned BCET, which have same characteristic of transferring positive charges, such as proton, metal ion, and organic cation. Molecular switch can be controlled directly by electricity through BCET process. Solid electrochromic device was fabricated with extremely high coloration efficiency (720 cm/C), great reversibility (no degradation for 600 cycles), and quick respond time (30 ms).",

The highly efficient oxidation of hypochlorite towards triphenylphosphine was discovered and utilized to distinguish hypochlorite and peroxynitrite with the aid of nitroxyl. A rare photoinduced electron transfer (PET) phenomenon from the donor fluorophore to the acceptor fluorophore was observed and adopted to give the signal of sequence sensing. Furthermore, the probe gave real-time signal selectively towards peroxynitrite and nitroxyl in Hela cells.",

        "abstract": "Bistable display has been a long-awaited goal due to its zero energy cost when maintaining colored or colorless state and electrochromic material has been highly considered as a potential way to achieve bistable display due to its simple structure and possible manipulation. However, it is extremely challenging with insurmountable technical barriers related to traditional electrochromic mechanisms. Herein a prototype for bistable electronic\u00a0billboard\u00a0and\u00a0reader with high energy\u00a0efficiency is demonstrated with excellent bistability (decay 7% in an hour), reversibility (10 cycles), coloration\u00a0efficiency (430\u2009cmC) and very short voltage stimulation time (2\u2009ms) for color switching, which greatly outperforms current products. This is achieved by stabilization of redox molecule via intermolecular ion transfer to the supramolecular bonded colorant and further stabilization of the electrochromic molecules in semi-solid media. This promising approach for ultra-energy-efficient display will promote the development of switching\u00a0molecules, devices and applications in various fields of driving/navigation/industry as display to save energy.",

Through proper molecular modification with NO2, the transformation from merocyanine (MC) to ring-closed SP or ring-closed OX can be controlled separately with visible light or base stimuli in solution, respectively, and these processes are proved by UV-vis, NMR spectra and control experiments. The cis-merocyanine (cis-MC) form is involved in basochromic process in solution. DFT calculation suggests the bidirectional switching property of the fused SP-OX molecular switch can be controlled separately, when the OX isomer is more stable than the deprotonated SP isomer. Because of the significant color variations in solution, the simple dual-addressable switch has been further applied to construct a multicolor reversible display on paper successfully.",

        "abstract": "Even though numerous thermochromic fluorescence materials (TFMs) have been reported, effective and universal strategies for development of ideal TFMs with simple preparation, low cost, excellent performances and practicability are still urgently required. Herein, we report a simple and general platform for such TFMs via taking biomimetic lipid like fatty acids (FA) as effecitve matrix which is applicable to abundant simple fluorophores. Change of crystallinity of FA induced by phase transition regulates the reversible interconversion between non-dispersion and dispersion states of fluorescent dyes (e.g., coumarins), thus leading to obvious fluorescence (FL) change of the TFMs based on both. Its reaction mechanism was proved in detail by FL spectra, XRD and SEM techniques. Substituent effect of coumarins and nature of FA play important roles in adjusting properties of the TFMs, such as FL colour and responsive temperature. Additionally, their multiple feasible potential applications (i.e., in situ thermometers, thermal response FL papers, FL colour change crayon, anti-counterfeiting and encryption, erasable or long-preservative thermal printing) with selective multi-mode (i.e., groove-fill, writable pen, loading on paper substrate) were developed. These TFMs with the merit of easy preparation, low cost, obvious colour change (ca. 100 nm shifts), fast response speed, good reversibility and high adjustability are very close to industrial application requirements. Design and prepared principles from this work should facilitate the development of other novel stimuli-responsive fluorescence materials.",

A key challenge lies in developing a general route for generation of CPL with tailored chiroptical activity using low-cost raw materials suitable for scale-up. This study presents that cellulose films with photonic bandgaps (PBG) and left-handed helical sense have an intrinsic ability for circular polarization leading to PBG-based CPL with extraordinary |g\u200a| values, well-defiend handedness, and tailorable wavelength by the PBG change. Using such cellulose films, incident light ranging from near-UV to near-IR can be transformed to passive L-CPL and R-CPL with viewing-side-dependent handedness and |g\u200a| values up to 0.87, and spontaneous emission transformed to R-CPL emission with |g\u200a| values up to 0.68. Unprecedented evidence is presented with theoretical underpinning that the PBG effect can stimulate the R-CPL emission. The potential of cellulose-based CPL films for polarization-based encryption is illustrated. The evaporation-induced self-assembly coupled with nanoscale mesogens of cellulose nanocrystals opens new venues for technological advances and enables a versatile strategy for rational design and scalable manufacturing of organic and inorganic CPL films for photonic applications.",

Phase composition, microstructure, density and in-line transmittance of the Y 2 Ti 2 O 7  ceramics were investigated. The detailed results indicated that as Y content increased, the density and in-line transmittance increased at first and then decreased. And the highest in-line transmittance of Y 2 Ti 2 O 7  ceramics is 49.9% at 1100\u202fnm when the excess amount of Y to Ti is 2%. The effect of Y content on densification process of Y 2 Ti 2 O 7  ceramics was discussed based on an assumption that oxygen vacancy defects were the dominated defects.",

In particular, PMs with smart targeting can deliver anti-cancer drugs directly into tumor cells at a sustained rate. PMs with core\u2013shell structure (with diameters of 10\u00a0~\u00a0100\u00a0nm) have been prepared by a variety of biodegradable and biocompatible polymers via a self-assembly process. The preparation of polymeric micelles with stimuli-responsive block copolymers or modification of target molecules on polymeric micelles\u2019 surface are able to significantly improve the efficiency of drug delivery. Polymeric micelles, which have been considered as a novel promising drug carrier for cancer therapeutics, are rapidly evolving and being introduced in an attempt to overcome several limitations of traditional chemotherapeutics, including water solubility, tumor-specific accumulation, anti-tumor efficacy, and non-specific toxicity. This review describes the preparation of polymeric micelles and the targeted modification which greatly enhance the effects of chemotherapeutic agents.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports a low-cost yellow-orange emitting Y 3Al 5-xSi xO 12-xN x:Ce 3+ phosphor with excellent color rendering for warm white LEDs. It was synthesized by a simple gas pressure sintering (GPS). The effect of Si 4+N 3- incorporation on the optical properties of Y 3Al 5O 12:Ce 3+ phosphor was investigated. The addition of Si 3N 4 leads to an obvious shift of its emission spectra toward the red region and an increase of FWHM accompanying a significant decrease of photoluminescent intensity, which is assigned to incorporation of N 3- in Ce 3+ nearest neighbor coordination. Adding nanosized amorphous Si 3N 4 or flux can greatly improve the emission intensity of Y 2.925Ce 0.075Al 5-xSi xO 12-xN x phosphor. Finally, the white LED flat lamp with a CRI as high as 83, luminous efficiency of 65 lm/W, and CCT of about 3700 K is successfully realized by using a single oxynitride phosphor combined with a blue LED chip, which is acceptable for general indoor illuminations to replace fluorescent or incandescent lamps. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "In this contribution, we propose to combine both narrow-band green (\u03b2-sialon:Eu<sup>2+</sup>) and red (K<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>:Mn<sup>4+</sup>) phosphors with a blue InGaN chip to achieve white light-emitting diodes (wLEDs) with a large color gamut and a high efficiency for use as the liquid crystal display (LCD) backlighting. \u03b2-sialon:Eu<sup>2+</sup>, prepared by a gas-pressure sinteing technique, has a peak emission at 535 nm, a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 54 nm, and an external quantum efficiency of 54.0% under the 450 nm excitation. K<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>:Mn<sup>4+</sup> was synthesized by a twe-step co-precipitation methods, and exhibits a sharp line emission spectrum with the most intensified peak at 631 nm, a FWHM of ~3 nm, and an external quantum efficiency of 54.5%. The prepared three-band wLEDs have a high color temperature of 11,184 - 13,769 K (i.e., 7,828 - 8,611 K for LCD displays), and a luminous efficacy of 91 - 96 lm/W, measured under an applied current of 120 mA. The color gamut defined in the CIE 1931 and CIE 1976 color spaces are 85.5 - 85.9% and 94.3 - 96.2% of the NTSC stanadard, respectively. These optical properties are better than those phosphor-cpnverted wLED backlights using wide-band green or red phosphoprs, suggesting that the two narrow-band phosphors investigated are the most suitable luminescent materials for achieving more bright and vivid displays.",

        "abstract": "Knowing the physicochemical properties of a material is of great importance to design and utilize it in a suitable way. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of photoluminescence spectra, localized cathodoluminescence, temperature-dependent luminescence efficiency, and applications of Eu(2+)-doped Sr0.5Ba0.5Si2O2N2 in solid-state lighting. This phosphor exhibits a broad emission band with a maximum at 560-580 nm and a full-width at half maximum of 92-103 nm upon blue light excitation, whereas a dual-band emission (i.e., 470 nm and 550 nm) is observed under electron beam irradiation due to perhaps the intergrowth of BaSi2O2N2:Eu(2+) and Sr0.5+\u03c3Ba0.5-\u03c3Si2O2N2:Eu(2+) in each phosphor particle. Under 450 nm blue light irradiation, this yellow phosphor exhibits excellent luminescence properties with absorption, internal and external efficiencies of 83.2, 87.7 and 72.6%, respectively. Furthermore, it also possesses high thermal stability, with the quantum efficiency being decreased by only 4.2% at 150 \u00b0C and a high quenching temperature of 450 \u00b0C. High-efficiency white LEDs using the title phosphor have a luminous efficacy, color temperature and color rendition of \u223c120 lm W(-1), 6000 K and 61, respectively, validating its suitability for use in solid-state white lighting.

        "abstract": "An orange-yellow-emitting Ca1.62Eu0.38Si5O3N6 phosphor was discovered by a single-particle-diagnosis approach. The crystal structure was analysed by single crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing that it crystallizes in a monoclinic system with the space group of Cm (No. 8), cell parameters of a = 7.0595(2) A, b = 23.7504(6) A, and c = 9.6345(2) A. Both the single crystal and the powder sample show similar luminescence properties. The excitation spectrum ranges from UV to blue light regions, enabling its use in UV, or blue LED driven white-LEDs. The new phosphor exhibits a two-peak emission behavior, with a very weak blue emision band centered at about 470 nm and a strong orange-yellow emission band centred at 592\u2013 600 nm, which correspond to the emissions of two different Eu2+ sites in the structure. Subsequently, an efficient energy transfer between two different Eu2+ sites was discussed. In addition, the new phosphor shows high thermal stability. At 150 \u00b0C, the luminescence intensity of the single crystal remains 84% of that measured at room temperature, with high activation energy for thermal quenching (0.240 eV). The results suggest that the new orange-yellow phosphor has potential application in vivid indoor lighting or displays.",

In this work, we report a very promising red phosphor that can minimize the aforementioned trade-off via structure and band-gap engineering, achieved by introducing isostructural LiSi2N3 into CaAlSiN3:Eu2+.

These FELs show no luminance saturation and stable chromatic coordinates with increasing anode voltage and current. Driven at 7 kV and 100 \u03bcA, the white FEL with the AlN:Eu2+ to Ca-\u03b1-sialon:Eu2+ ratio of 0.65 to 0.35 has the luminance of 3,412 cd/m2, a color temperature of 3,430 K, and a color rendering index of 76. Higher color rendition of 93-95 can be obtained by using the phosphor blend of AlN:Eu2+, \u03b2-sialon:Eu2+ (green) and CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ (red). It indicates that nitride phosphors could be used as robust emissive materials in highly reliable white FELs.",

        "abstract": "A new red phosphor with broadband emission has yielded white LEDs that have both a high luminous efficacy and excellent colour rendering. By applying structure and bandgap engineering strategies, Rong-Jun Xie and co-workers from China, Japan and the USA fabricated their rare-earth phosphor from Ca1\u2212xLixAl1\u2212xSi1+xN3:Eu2+. They say that the introduction of LiS2N3 to CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ minimizes the usual trade-off between emission colour and efficiency. When the red phosphor was combined with a commercial blue InGaN LED and a green phosphor, the result was a white LED with a luminous efficacy exceeding 100 lumens per watt and a high colour rendering. The researchers note that in addition to superior colour quality, the use of LiS2N3 imparts better thermal stability to the phosphor compared with currently used red phosphors.",

The effects of surfactants on the structure and luminescence were investigated by X-ray diffraction and fluorescence spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction analysis showed the positions of the characteristic peaks. Fluorescence spectrophotometer analysis yielded photoluminescence (PL)/photoluminescence excitation (PLE) behavior and the asymmetry factor of luminescence. However, the results showed that the relative peaks intensity of samples was apparently different. The reason can contributed to the intensities of the characteristic diffraction peaks [(2\u00a02\u00a02) and (4\u00a00\u00a00)] become stronger, indicating higher crystallinity of Y 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ , suggesting that the differing luminescence was largely crystallinity dependent.",

        "abstract": "A facile chemical method was employed to prepare fine BiPO4:Tb3+ phosphor particles calcined at the same temperature. Introducing lithium greatly affected the morphology of the samples and further affected the luminescence intensity. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The XRD patterns of BiPO4:Tb3+ indicated a monoclinic phase. According to the fluorescence emission spectra, the most intense emission is the 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 transition peaking around 545 nm, corresponding to the green light. Based on the intensity ratios of 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 6 to 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 in the emission spectra, it can be concluded that introducing Li+ can change the symmetry of the crystal lattice and modify the emission intensity. Sharp lines at 377 nm are the strongest f\u2013f transitions and match well with near-UV LED chips.",

For Y1 \u2212 x La x PO4:Eu3+, they have similar phase composition of a mixture of monoclinic LaPO4 and tetragonal YPO4. Furthermore, the luminescence behavior of Eu3+ has been investigated in this type of matrices. In Y1 \u2212 x La x PO4:Eu3+, the 5D0-7F1 magnetic dipole transition is dominant, indicating that the Eu3+ site is inversion symmetry. The difference in the Eu-O charge transfer (CT) band with La3+ ion concentration suggests the difference in the ionicity of the Eu-O bond. Among those products, the red to orange intensity ratio (R/O) of 5D0-7F2 to 5D0-7F1 value of Eu3+ is different, furthermore, for La3+ x = 0.3, the R/O value of Eu3+ is the biggest on the contrary, indicating that the inversion symmetry Eu3+ is lowest.",

Under 275 nm excitation, the strongest emission line is observed at 576.6 nm, corresponding to the transition from 4 F 9/2\u20136 H 13/2 level of Dy3+ ion. The yellow/blue (Y/B) intensity ratio 4 F 9/2\u20136 H 13/2 to 4 F 9/2\u20136 H 15/2 values of Dy3+ for the phosphors doped with different divalent alkaline-earth metal ions is changes slightly.

The PFO-DBT10 copolymers with various molecular weights (MWs) have identical absorption spectra and energy levels. However, as the molecular weight increases, so does the photoluminescence intensity ratio of DBT to DOF segments. For polymer light-emitting diodes, PFO-DBT10 with a large MW shows an enhanced charge trapping effect, leading to increased operation voltage under any given current density, worse luminous efficiency, and more saturated red emission, compared to the one with a small MW. The experiments are performed within the framework of the componentu0027s molar ratio dispersion of random copolymer chains induced by the MW using the binomial distribution formula. According to the formula, the high MW random copolymer is analogous to the ideal PFO-DBT10 in terms of the uniformly distributed units. The low MW random copolymer is more likely to be a mixture of pure PFO and PFO-DBTx, in which the molar ratio x varies, due to its dispersive component distribution. This work offers a new approach to study the opto-electronic properties of random copolymers in the light of component distribution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Two series of twisted bipolar poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives, namely PCz-37RSOs and PCz-28SOs, were synthesized by introducing electron-deficient 2,8-dioctyl- dibenzothiophene- S,S -dioxide-3,7-diyl (37RSO) and dibenzothiophene-  S,S \u2013 dioxide \u22122,8-diyl (28SO) unit into poly(9-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole) (PCz) backbone, respectively. The incorporation of electron-withdrawing 37RSO and 28SO into PCz backbone decreased effective conjugation length, and further restrained charge transfer effect existed in dipolar system, simultaneously, the balanced charge carrier injection/transportation were realized due to the eletrophilicity of SO unit. Consequently, the resulting polymers showed hypsochromic shift and narrowed emission spectra regarding to  PCz-37SOs  that contains linear SO unit in main chain, and exhibited balanced hole/electron fluxes with respect to  PCz  in the range of 0\u201310\u202fV. The single-layer devices based on resulting bipolar polymers exhibited excellent electroluminescent spectra stability in the current densities from 100 to 400\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122 , and displayed deep blue electroluminescence spectra with the Commission Internationale de L\u2019 Eclairage (CIE) of (0.16, 0.07) for  PCz-37RSO5  and (0.16, 0.09) for  PCz-28SO5 . The superior device performance was achieved with the maximum luminous efficiency (LE max ) of 2.69\u202fcd\u202fA \u22121  for  PCz-28SO20 , which obviously outperformed that of 0.24\u202fcd\u202fA \u22121  for  PCz . These results indicated that twisted molecular structure design is a promising strategy for efficient deep blue light-emitting polymers.",

Our paper aims to address the construction of universal entanglers. We prove that universal entanglers may be obtained from random unitary gates according to the Harr measure. The success probability is close to 1 for large system spaces. This result represents the typical density of entanglement subspaces in large state spaces. It also partially solves an open problem of universal bipartite entanglers and is explained by some experiment simulations.",

Most of previous algorithms are based on the qubit systems. Herein a proposal for a universal circuit is given based on the qudit system, which is larger and can store more information. In order to prove its universality for quantum applications, an explicit set of one-qudit and two-qudit gates is provided for the universal qudit computation. The one-qudit gates are general rotation for each two-dimensional subspace while the two-qudit gates are their controlled extensions. In comparison to previous quantum qudit logical gates, each primitive qudit gate is only dependent on two free parameters and may be easily implemented. In experimental implementation, multilevel ions with the linear ion trap model are used to build the qudit systems and use the coupling of neighbored levels for qudit gates. The controlled qudit gates may be realized with the interactions of internal and external coordinates of the ion.",

A one-step transmission scheme and designed decoy photons can be used against various quantum attacks. The new protocol can ensure fairness, efficiency, and security.

Through the single-photon input-output process in the cavity QED, it is shown that the maximally entangled atomic (photonic) W state can be extracted from partially entangled W state. The distinct feature of our protocol is that we can concentrate both atomic and photonic entangled states via the photonic Faraday rotation, and thus they may be useful in long distant communication in the experiment. Furthermore, since the photonic Faraday rotation works in low-Q cavities and only involves virtual excitation of atoms, our schemes are insensitive to both the cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission.",

However, the big data era makes even higher demands from the data mmmg technologies in terms of both processing speed and data amounts. Any data mmmg algorithm itself can hardly meet these requirements towards effective processing of big data, so distributed systems are proposed to be used. In this paper, a novel method of integrating a sequential pattern mmmg algorithm with a fast large-scale data processing engine Spark is proposed to mine patterns in big data. We use the well-known algorithm PrefixSpan as an example to demonstrate how this method helps handle massive data rapidly and conveniently. The experiments show that this method can make full use of cluster computing resources to accelerate the mmmg process, with a better performance than",

Quantum noises are prevalent in quantum communication, and it can seriously affect the safety and reliability of quantum communication system. In this paper, we study the effect of quantum noise on deterministic remote state preparation of an arbitrary two-particle state via different quantum channels including the  state, Brown state and GHZ state. Firstly, the output states and fidelities of three DRSP algorithms via different quantum entangled channels in four noisy environments, including amplitude-damping, phase-damping, bit-flip and depolarizing noise, are presented, respectively. And then, the effects of noises on three kinds of preparation algorithms in the same noisy environment are discussed. In final, the theoretical analysis proves that the effect of noise in the process of quantum state preparation is only related to the noise type and the size of noise factor and independent of the different entangled quantum channels. Furthermore, another important conclusion is given that the effect of noise is also independent of how to distribute intermediate particles for implementing DRSP through quantum measurement during the concrete preparation process. These conclusions will be very helpful for improving the efficiency and safety of quantum communication in a noisy environment.",

This paper proposes a novel quantum image steganography algorithm based on an efficient embedding technique of exploiting modification direction. For convenience, this embedding technique is referred to the EMD embedding. In the EMD embedding, it is clear that each carrier pixel-group of the carrier image contains N pixels and each secret digit of secret information belongs to the (2N + 1)-ary notational system, where N is a system parameter. The embedding process is that at most only one pixel of the carrier pixel-group will be either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. The new algorithm takes advantage of the EMD embedding owning high embedding efficiency that the (2N + 1) different modifications to N carrier pixels represent the value of the secret digit. In addition, designing the dedicated quantum circuit for the EMD embedding contributes to better understanding the process of the new algorithm. Experimental simulation based on MATLAB shows that the new algorithm has good performance on imperceptibility, security, embedding efficiency and embedding capacity.",

Comparing with the previous quantum steganography algorithms, the new protocol focuses on its anti-noise capability for phase-flip noises, which proved its good security resisting on quantum noise. Furthermore, the covert communication of secret information in the quantum secure direct communication channel would not affect the normal information transmission process due to the new protocolu0027s good imperceptibility. If the number of Brown states transmitted in cover protocol is many enough, the imperceptibility of the secret channel can be further enhanced. In aspect of capacity, the new protocol can further expand its capacity by combining with other quantum steganography protocols. Because the proposed protocol does not require the participation of the classic channel when it implements the transmission of secret information, it does not cause any additional information leakage and has good security.

        "abstract": "Multi-particle quantum state deterministic remote preparation is a fundamental and important technical branch in quantum communication. Since quantum noise is unavoidable in realistic quantum communication, it is important to analyze the effect of noise on multi-particle quantum communication protocols. In this paper, we study the effects of noise, such as amplitude damping, phase damping, bit-flip and depolarizing noises, on two deterministic remote preparation of an arbitrary three-particle state protocols, which are based on two different entangled channels, namely \\(\\chi \\) state and Brown state. The detailed mathematical analysis shows that the output states of two deterministic remote state preparation (DRSP) protocols are the same in the same noisy environment. That is to say, in the same noisy environment, the effects of noise on two DRSP protocols are the same. This conclusion proves that these two DRSP protocols will produce the same arbitrary three-particle states in the same noise channel environment, and so that these protocols are inherently convergent and can be substituted for each other in certain circumstances. In addition, this paper also takes three-particle states \\(a\\left| {000} \\right\\rangle + b{\\mathrm{e}^{ic}}\\left| {111} \\right\\rangle \\) as an example and studies the relationship between the fidelity, the target state and the size of the noise factor. The results show that if the target state can be selected, an appropriate target state can effectively resist on the bit-flip noise. If the target state cannot be selected, as the increase in the size of noise factor, the fidelities of the two DRSP schemes in the amplitude damping noise and phase damping noise are always larger than those in the bit-flip noise and depolarizing noise. This conclusion indicates that two protocols have better resistance on amplitude damping and phase damping noise than the bit-flip and depolarizing noises. These findings and analyses will provide valid help in deterministic remote preparation of an arbitrary three-particle state in a noisy environment.",

The new protocol can also achieve better imperceptibility, since the eavesdropper can hardly detect the hidden channel or even obtain effective secret quantum states.

Moreover, using a photon state with multiple modes, we can realize $$2^n$$2n-atom W state. All these schemes are insensitive to the variation of the atom---photon coupling rates and are also right for remotely trapped atoms by using the photonic transmissions, local quantum operations, and classical channel.

In this paper, we investigate general quantum transformations forbidden or permitted by the superposition principle for various goals. First, we prove a no-encoding theorem that forbids linearly superposing of an unknown pure state and a fixed pure state in Hilbert space of a finite dimension. The new theorem is further extended for multiple copies of an unknown state as input states. These generalized results of the no-encoding theorem include the no-cloning theorem, the no-deleting theorem and the no-superposing theorem as special cases. Second, we provide a unified scheme for presenting perfect and imperfect quantum tasks (cloning and deleting) in a one-shot manner. This scheme may lead to fruitful results that are completely characterized with the linear independence of the representative vectors of input pure states. The upper bounds of the efficiency are also proved. Third, we generalize a recent superposing scheme of unknown states with a fixed overlap into new schemes when multiple copies of an unknown state are as input states.",

Firstly, the contacts manufactured by VAR have more homogeneous micro-structures than the contacts produced by VIM. Secondly, the electrical endurance performance of contacts manufactured by VAR shows better electrical endurance than that manufactured by VIM. Results of electrical endurance test, performed according to national standard GB/T 3855\u20132008, show that the contacts manufactured by VIM can withstand 38 interruptions of 25 kA short-circuit current at 12 kV voltage level.

        "abstract": "Back-to-back capacitor bank switching is a specific operation which combines an inrush current during a making process and a power frequency current interruption followed by a subsequent DC recovery voltage during a breaking process. For a vacuum interrupter (VI), the dielectric strength is mainly depends on the condition of the contact surfaces which may be damaged by a pre-arcing of the inrush currents. So the contact material and the fabrication process of the contact play an important role on back-to-back capacitor bank switching behaviors. The objective of this paper is to investigate the back-to-back capacitor bank switching performance of vacuum interrupters with three different contact materials (infiltration CuCr 50, vacuum induction melting CuCr40Te0.005 and vacuum arc melting CuCr 50). The three different contact materials are installed in nine 12kV VIs which undergo a series of back-to-back capacitor bank switching tests at an inrush current of 8 kA (peak value, frequency 3800 Hz). The experimental results show that the average value of the restrike probabilities of the VIs for each contact material are that vacuum induction melting CuCr40Te0.005 is 5.8%, infiltration CuCr 50 is 6.7% and vacuum arc melting CuCr 50 is 8.3%. For all VIs, the restrikes mainly occur between (1/4)\u00b7T and 10\u00b7T of the recovery voltage (T is a cycle of the recovery voltage that is 20 ms). Many reignitions also occur before (1/4)\u00b7T. The number of reignition follows the order of vacuum induction melting CuCr40Te0.005 (1 times) <; vacuum arc melting CuCr 50 (9 times) <; infiltration CuCr 50 (10 times).",

        "abstract": "High current vacuum arcs are essentially metal vapor arcs, and the contact material has a directly impact on the vacuum arcs. The objective of this paper is to experimentally determine the anode spot threshold current subjected to axial magnetic fields for four pure metals in vacuum arcs. Four pure metals are W, Mo, Cr and Fe respectively, which covers a wide range of thermal and electrical parameters. The experiments were performed in a demountable vacuum chamber, and a pair of Helmholtz coil was set in the chamber to supply axial magnetic fields. Arc current in the experiments was in a range from 2kA to 30kA at 50Hz. A high-speed charge-coupled device video camera was used to record the arc evolution through an observing window. The onset of anode spot phenomenon was determined by high-speed photographs, arc voltage and contact erosion pattern. By a combination criterion, the anode spot threshold current for different materials were presented. The results show that the thermal and electrical parameters have a significant influence on the anode spot formation and the anode spot formation has an intimate connection with anode surface heat transfer process. The results also show that the axial magnetic flux density can improve the threshold current significantly.",

The experiment was based on the butt type copper electrodes, with contact diameter D=40mm, and gap distance g=10mm. The vacuum arc was ignited by a needle tungsten electrode, which was embedded in the cathode. A high-voltage pulse with a rise time of 8ns, and aptitude of 24kV was applied on the needle electrode. The arc current varied from 2.8kA to 7.5kA (rms). The arc current was measured by Hall sensor and the arc voltage was measured by Tektronix P6015A, respectively. The arcing process was recorded by a high-speed charge-coupled device (CCD) video camera. The emission intensities of the interelectrode plasma of the vacuum arc were collected by an optics spectrograph. The Bolzman plot method was used to calculate the electron temperature and the Saha equation was used to determine the electron density of diffuse vacuum arc mode and anode spot mode. The electron temperature was 1.09eV in diffuse arc mode and it was 1.22eV in anode spot mode. The electron density was increased from 7.6 \u00d7 10 15 /cm 3  to 2.1 \u00d7 10 15 /cm 3  when the arc mode changed from diffuse arc mode to anode spot mode.",

The rough surface conditions would have a significant influence on the characteristics of the microscopic electric field on the electrode surface. The objective of this paper is to extract the typical fractal parameters and establish the electrode rough surfaces based on fractal theory and measurement. Firstly, the electrodes of the typical material CuCr25 were measured by Atomic Force Microscope (Bruker, Dimension Icon). The sampling interval was 2 nm and the sampling length was  $1 mumathbf{m}$ . Secondly, the wavelet analysis method was used to extract the fractal dimension of the W-M function and the Daubechies wavelet function base with two orders (DB2) was determined to be the most suitable one for extracting the fractal dimension. Then, two methods were used to extract the fractal scaling constant of the W-M function and the wavelet analysis method was chosen to be the most suitable one. Finally, the fractal model was established and the surface roughness of both engineering surfaces and fractal surfaces has been calculated. The results may provide some useful reference to study the vacuum breakdown phenomena.",

The objective of this paper is to investigate the characteristics of the microscopic electric field enhancement of vacuum gap electrodes based on fractal modeling and random surface under same conditions. In this paper, a 2D model based on the fractal modeling and a 3D model based on the random surface were all established both in the cases of the maximum height of the micro-protrusion on the electrodes surface 0.1 \u03bcm, 0.3 \u03bcm, 0.5 \u03bcm and 1 \u03bcm. The applied voltage was 1500 V and the contact gap was 50 um. The fractal modeling of the micro-protrusion on the electrode surface was established based on Weierstrass-Mandelbrot equation. The random surface was established using a random array as the height of micro-protrusion. Then, the electrical field distributions on the electrode surface were simulated based on the fractal modeling and the random surface. Comparing the two different electrode surfaces modeling, it was found that the details of the micro-features on the electrode surface would have an influence on the microscopic electric field and even to the vacuum breakdown processes. The results of this paper may provide some information for the further research of the vacuum breakdown mechanism.",

In this paper we consider how the fractional quantum Hall effect may arise in this context, by studying the dynamics of giant graviton probes in a special LLM geometry, the AdS 5 \u00d7 S 5 background, that corresponds to a circular droplet. The giant gravitons we study are D3-branes wrapping on a 3-sphere in S 5 . Their low energy world-volume theory, truncated to the 1 / 2 BPS sector, is shown to be described by a Chern\u2013Simons finite-matrix model. We demonstrate that these giant gravitons may condense at right density further into fractional quantum Hall fluid due to the repulsive interaction in the model, giving rise to the new states in IIB string theory. Some features of the novel physics of these new states are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Aberrant microRNAs (miRNAs) expressions could contribute to the progression of numerous cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, while miR-10a participates in multiple biological processes on cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of miR-10a in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been investigated. Herein, miR-10a was significantly reduced in ESCC clinical tissues and ESCC cell lines (EC109 and TE-3). In addition, immunohistochemistry indicated that the expressions of \u03b1-SMA, Ki-67, and PCNA in tumor tissues were higher than that of controls. In vitro, overexpression of miR-10a dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced cell apoptosis, while the decrease of miR-10a expressed the opposite outcome. Specially, overexpression of miR-10a caused a G0/G1 peak accumulation. Moreover, miR-10a also negatively regulated ESCC cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, targetscan bioinformatics predictions and the dual-luciferase assay confirmed that Tiam1 was a direct target gene of miR-10a. The statistical analysis showed Tiam1 was negatively in correlation with miR-10a in ESCC patient samples. And silencing Tiam1 could lead to a decline on cell growth, invasion, and migration in ESCC cell lines, while it could enhance cell apoptosis and cause a G0/G1 peak accumulation. In vivo, it revealed that miR-10a notably decreased the tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft model and pulmonary metastasis model. And it showed a lower expressions of Tiam1 in the miR-10a mimics group by immunohistochemistry. Taken together the results, they indicated that miR-10a might function as a novel tumor suppressor in vitro and in vivo via targeting Tiam1, suggesting miR-10a to be a candidate biomarker for the ESCC therapy.",

        "abstract": "The problem of automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) deadlock has received considerable attention recently. Most researchers have assumed that allocated resources do never fail. However, this is not the case in practice since some resources may fail unexpectedly. In our previous work, we just presumed unreliable resources and developed supervisory algorithms to ensure robust deadlock-free operation in the event of resource failure. In this paper, the failure includes not only failed resources but also failed products. For a product, it can have a temporary storage in a buffer when the product does not necessarily need to progress or an unreliable resource is not expectably well behaved. We propose a deadlock avoidance algorithm and a robust supervisory algorithm in the paradigm of buffer-supported system of sequential systems with shared resources and recovery (B-S 4 R 2 ). The proposed algorithms can ensure the processes not requiring the failed resources still operate normally without any interruption and the failed products are recovered to continue their manufacturing process. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective as well as efficient in response to resource and product failures.",

        "abstract": "There is much research on automated manufacturing systems (AMSs), particularly regarding their deadlock problems, in order to improve their competitiveness. Resources in most of deadlock solutions are always supposed never to fail. However, this is not the case in practice since some resources may fail unexpectedly. A robust system should be resilient to such failures. Thus, it requires that the failure of a resource can only affect the processes which mandatorily require the failed ones. In this paper, we focus on the robust control of AMSs with unreliable resources. On the basis of deadlock avoidance strategy, we propose a robust control algorithm in the paradigm of extended systems of simple sequential processes with resources, which can acquire multiple types of resources and obey a multipath selection mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective as well as efficient in response to resource failures.",

Similarly, we have done a lot of programming innovation, such as in the data structure and search algorithm, in order to make the software more efficient. Compared with other software, ours can be quicker to attain the simulation results. Moreover, our Petri net simulator proves to be a valuable aid for Control Engineering education.

The environment along with the different types of mobile UGVs is represented by a colored Petri net model.

By replacing the rounded, wet-etched, antireflection coated back facet of a spiral cavity with a passive loop facet, the lasing action was suppressed (i.e., threshold current density increased) due to a decrease in the back facet reflectivity. This type of facet allowed us to achieve a twofold increase in the peak SL power by employing a 16-mm-long spiral cavity.",

Using nuclear magnetic resonance technology obtains the pore structure T2 map of H2O and (NH4)2SO4 solution in the ore leaching process and inverts and reconstitutes the pore structure distribution image. The results of contrastive analysis experiments indicate that impact factors of the ore leaching process on the microstructure of rare earth orebodies include two aspects: solution seepage and ion exchange. The main factor of pore structure distribution is the ion exchange action, determined by a dual effect. The sole action of solution seepage leads to an increase in pore size, which means that pore size structure is changing from small and medium to macro. Ion exchange gives rise to the movement and restructuring of particles, which results in a decrease in pore sizes. The pore structure changes from loose to compact; in the entire ore leaching process, the ion exchange action advances in a layered shape along the direction of seepage, and the chemical replacement and physical seepage alternately impact the microstructure of the orebodies.",

In this study, saturated leaching tests were applied to investigate the permeability characteristics of rare earth ore under the hydro-chemical coupling effect. The pore radius distributions based on two leaching solutions (H2O and (NH4)2SO4) were obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance detection technology. The results indicated that 10\u201325 \u03bcm and 4\u201310 \u03bcm pores are dominant in the ore under solution leaching using H2O and (NH4)2SO4, respectively. A \u201cblack belt\u201d in the pores of (NH4)2SO4 leaching was discovered from the reconstruction of the pore structure distribution image. The results also reveal that the hydraulic conductivity will initially increase, then decrease and finally increase during the leaching process. The hydro-chemical coupling effect will lead to variations in the pore structure and permeability of rare earth ore. The pore radius will increase due to solution seepage, whereas it decreases due to the particle recombination induced by chemical replacement. The permeability of rare earth ore is influenced more by chemical replacement than by solution seepage.",

To reveal the formation and evolution mechanisms of aggregates, a self-developed column leaching experimental device was employed in conjunction with nuclear magnetic resonance technology. The relationships among the amount of rare earth leaching, the evolution of the microscopic pore structure, the porosity, and the leaching time were obtained. A comparative analysis of pure water and ammonium chloride test groups revealed that aggregates were present only in the latter. Consequently, the results of comprehensive analyses indicate that the formation of aggregates is a temporary particle deposition phenomenon caused by the settling of fine soil particles migrating from the top to the bottom of a sample. Furthermore, chemical exchanges constitute the main cause of aggregate formation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background There is currently no clear consensus on the relative suitabilities of laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as minimally invasive treatment for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods In this retrospective study, we enrolled 156 patients with a single, small HCC with nodular diameters <4 cm and compared recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients treated with LH and control patients treated with RFA (n = 78 each). The groups were selected according to predefined criteria and matched in terms of their baseline clinical characteristics. Results During a median follow-up of 31.2 months, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates in the LH group were 96.2, 91.3, and 84.1 %, respectively, compared with 96.2, 82.6, and 78.8 % in the RFA group. The corresponding RFS rates were 82.1, 71.5, and 60.0 % in the LH group and 65.4, 47.7, and 37.6 % in the RFA group. Combined RFS rates were significantly higher in the LH groups (P = 0.006), but there was no significant difference in OS rates (P = 0.510). The incidence of postoperative complications was significantly lower in the RFA group (28.2 vs. 10.3 %, P = 0.004), and operation duration, intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusion, use of total parenteral nutrition, and length of stay as indicators of minimal invasiveness were also significantly better in the RFA group. Conclusions There was no difference between LH and RFA in terms of OS in patients with a single, small HCC. However, RFA was less invasive than the LH, but LH was associated with increased RFS.",

        "abstract": "Recellularized liver, as an approach for hepatic tissue engineering, is an effective alternative to orthotopic liver transplantation for end-stage hepatic failure. When compared with normal liver, recellularized liver has a disparity in hepatocyte viability and function, owing to the difficulty of fully simulating the microenvironment of liver. Although the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is considered an important constituent of liver function, few studies have examined the effect of the SNS on hepatic tissue engineering. It is imperative to explore the regulation of the SNS on a tissue-like configuration to obtain an intact recellularized liver with better hepatic function. We have observed that various subtypes of adrenergic receptors (ARs) are expressed on the hepatocyte membrane. Salbutamol, an agonist of \u03b22-AR, promoted cell proliferation, albumin secretion and urea synthesis in the recellularized liver. Cytokines were screened in isoprenaline/salbutamol-treated recellularized liver, and the expression of IL-6 was significantly increased. Isoprenaline or salbutamol especially promoted the expression of Stat 3 and phosphorylated Stat 3, contributing to the activation of IL-6/Stat 3 signalling in promoting hepatocyte proliferation and recellularized liver function. This study suggests that activation of \u03b22-AR accelerated hepatocyte proliferation and improved recellularized liver function by mediating the IL-6/Stat 3 signalling pathway, indicating that nervous system regulation may be an essential component contributing to the complexity of recellularized liver in tissue engineering.",

We investigate the pricing and emissions reduction policies for two rival manufacturers with different emission reduction efficiencies under the cap-and-trade policy. We assume that the product demand is price and emission sensitive. Based on non-cooperative and cooperative games, the optimal solutions for the two manufacturers are derived in the purely competitive and co-opetitive market environments respectively. Through the discussion and numerical analysis, we uncovered that in both pure competition and co-opetition models, the two manufacturers\u2019 optimal prices depend on the unit price of carbon emission trading. In addition, higher emission reduction efficiency leads to lower optimal unit carbon emissions and higher profit in both the pure competition and co-petition models. Interestingly, compared to pure competition, co-opetition will lead to more profit and less total carbon emissions. However, the improvement in economic and environmental performance is based on higher product prices and unit carbon emissions.",

        "abstract": "We investigate a supply chain in which a retailer is supplied by two manufacturers with differentiated brands, a good brand and an average brand. The customers in the market are segmented based on value and brand preference, namely the customer acceptance of the average brand and the customer surplus for each brand. Both horizontal competition (between the two competing manufacturers) and vertical competition (between the manufacturers and the retailer) are considered through an exploration of different power structure combinations. Multiple-stage game models are developed to examine the impact of different power structures on the pricing decisions and the profits of the manufacturers and the retailer. We find that intensified competition between the two manufacturers hurts the manufacturers and benefits the retailer. No dominance among supply chain members (the two manufacturers and the retailer) leads to the highest profit for the entire supply chain. We also find that for the two competing manufacturers, being first to announce the pricing decision results in lower profit \u2013 the second to announce benefits from knowing the rivalu0027s price. This explains why rivals prefer not to reveal decisions on prices, bid rates, and contracts, as this information represents bargaining power. The impact of customer acceptance of the average brand is also analyzed.",

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of product mix as a strategy to deliver the low carbon supply chain under the cap-and-trade policy.Design/methodology/approachThe authors incorporate the cap-and-trade policy into the green product mix decision models by using game-theoretic approach and compare these decisions in a decentralized model and a centralized model, respectively. The research explores potential behavioral changes under the cap-and-trade in the context of a two-echelon supply chain.FindingsThe analysis results show that the channel structure has significant impact on both economic and environmental performances. An integrated supply chain generates more profits. In contrast, a decentralized supply chain has lower carbon emissions. The cap-and-trade policy makes a different impact on the economic and environmental performances of the supply chain. Balancing the trade-offs is critical to ensure the long-term sustainability.Originality/valueThe research offers many interesting observations with respect to the effect of product mix strategy on operational decisions and the trade-offs between costs and carbon emissions under the cap-and-trade policy. The insights derived from the analysis not only help firms to make important operational and strategic decisions to reduce carbon emissions while maintaining their economic competitiveness, but also make meaningful contribution to governments\u2019 policy making for carbon emissions control.",

Otherwise, a region-based data flow model is proposed to categorize message traffic as six types. To further improve the efficiency of computation, we leverage cyclic permutation of S_3 group to perform equivalent transformation between traffic models and hence the calculation is carried out in the same model.

We investigate a two-echelon supply chain that consists of a manufacturer and a retailer whose Customer demand is carbon emission sensitive. Using the game-theoretic approach, we compare the equilibrium solutions under three supply chain power structures to analyse the effects of power relationship on supply chain decisions and sustainability performance. A two-part tariff contract is designed to coordinate the supply chain. The findings provide important managerial insights that can help firms develop a better understanding of power relationship and coordination in achieving sustainability goals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Low carbon economy has become a top agenda for many countries following the agreement in the Paris meeting on climate change. In this article, we take price and emission sensitive demand into account and incorporate competition between the two rival manufacturers in the demand function. This research takes more proactive actions incorporating carbon emissions in the strategic and operational decisions, which complements the existing literature on low carbon manufacturing, in which the carbon emissions attribute is often used as a constraint, or only the single manufactureru0027s demand is considered. Based on game theory, the pricing and carbon emissions reduction decisions are investigated. Our study contributes to the existing literature on low carbon manufacturing by specifically examining the impact of production efficiency, carbon emissions reduction efficiency, and market power structure on achieving low carbon manufacturing. Through the systematic analysis of optimal pricing and green technology investment decisions to improve the economic and environmental performance under different market power structures, our findings provide valuable managerial implications, which will help many manufacturing firms to make important strategic and operational decisions regarding low carbon manufacturing.",

This research proposes an integrated framework that takes explicit account of multiple types of risk in aiding decision-making, and compares and ranks alternative risk mitigation strategies individually and collectively in indicator basis using fuzzy set theory and multiple criteria decision analysis methods. Through an illustrative case, the research demonstrates that the proposed framework provides a holistic view of supply chain risks and enables firms to foresee, spot and respond to the exposed risks in an effective and efficient manner.",

        "abstract": "Operational decisions made by manufacturers and retailers are often affected by the power relationships of both vertical and horizontal competitions in a supply chain. Although many studies have been carried to assess how the power structure impacts supply chains, most of them only focus on the power dynamics in the vertical competition or horizontal competition. This paper systematically examines the impacts of bidimensional power structure on a supply chain. Considering a triadic setting that is made of two rival retailers and a common manufacturer, we compare the equilibriums for the supply chain and individual firms with five different possible power structures. The analysis results show that the bidimensional power dynamics have a significant impact. Furthermore, the impacts of the bidimensional power structure are also dependent on the nature of customer demand. This paper provides important management implications that are supportive for companies to make strategic and operational decisions.",

        "abstract": "Option contracts have been increasingly employed by supply chain firms as a popular strategy to hedge against the risk of unanticipated demand. This paper examines the impact of bidirectional option contracts on a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer taking into consideration of a service requirement. We characterize the optimal solutions for the retailer and the supplier with and without bidirectional option contracts in the presence of a service requirement. By benchmarking to the model without bidirectional options, we explore the effect of bidirectional option contracts on the supply chain. Our study shows that the service level with bidirectional option contracts is equivalent to (higher than) that without them when the service requirement is (not) binding. In addition, bidirectional option contracts are indeed beneficial to both the retailer and the supplier. Furthermore, by investigating the effect of the service level on the supply chain, we find that the maximum expected profit of the retailer is non-increasing in the service requirement while that of the supplier is non-decreasing in the service requirement, either with or without bidirectional option contracts. Finally, a distribution-free coordination condition is proposed to achieve the Pareto improvement in the presence of bidirectional option contracts and a service requirement.",

We investigate how price cap regulation affects pharmaceutical firmsu0027 pricing decisions. We also evaluate the economic and social performance of the pharmaceutical supply chain and assess the risks associated with price cap regulation. The derived equilibriums under different price cap regulations, including retailer price cap regulation, manufacturer price cap regulation and linkage price cap regulation, are compared to that without regulation. Our results show that one-sided price cap regulation will damage the economic performance of the regulated firm, whereas the unregulated firm may gain a financial advantage. The regulation may increase the risk of a supply shortage if pharmaceutical firms cannot cope with the financial loss. In contrast, linkage price cap regulation can be an effective policy for improving both the economic and social performance of the pharmaceutical supply chain.",

We assume that customer demand is subject to customer sensitivity to the competitors\u2019 prices and service levels. First, we develop coopetition models under a symmetric case where there is identical service-investment efficiency between two firms. We then extend our analysis to an asymmetric case in which the two firms have different service-investment efficiencies. Our results show that the optimal strategic decisions regarding whether to compete or cooperate and how to cooperate depend on the intensity of the market competition in which the firms are engaged. The results also indicate that coopetition changes the dynamics of the competition and cooperation between the rival firms. More specifically, on the one hand, coopetition eases competition intensity in the cooperating area, for example, price or service; on the other hand, it increases competition intensity in the non-cooperating area. Decision frameworks are proposed that enable firms to make optimal strategic decisions on coopetition under various market conditions.",

We identified three unique stages in the evolution of the supply chain ambidextrous financing model: drivers for change (including identifying suppliersu0027 problems and constraints), designing and implementing the supply chain ambidextrous financing model, and the tripartite performance effects. The analysis demonstrated how ST utilized its market power, resources and network ties to harness expertise and competences of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to overcome IVs and become ambidextrous.

        "abstract": "In recent years, big data has emerged as one of the prominent buzzwords in business and management. In spite of the mounting body of research on big data across the social science disciplines, scholars have offered little synthesis on the current state of knowledge. To take stock of academic research that contributes to the big data revolution, this paper tracks scholarly worku0027s perspectives on big data in the management domain over the past decade. We identify key themes emerging in management studies and develop an integrated framework to link the multiple streams of research in fields of organisation, operations, marketing, information management and other relevant areas. Our analysis uncovers a growing awareness of big datau0027s business values and managerial changes led by data-driven approach. Stemming from the review is the suggestion for research that both structured and unstructured big data should be harnessed to advance understanding of big data value in informing organisational decisions and enhancing firm competitiveness. To discover the full value, firms need to formulate and implement a data-driven strategy. In light of these, the study identifies and outlines the implications and directions for future research.",

Essentially, this article provides insight into meaningful differences in future ratingsbetween responding and non-responding hotels, as well as differences in response stylesbetween ratings improvement and non-improvement. The results indicate that: 1) subsequentratings are higher if customers receive responses to their previous online reviews;2) increase in ratings is more significant among low-satisfaction customers, and a decrease inratings is mitigated if responses are provided; 3) responding to loyal customers \u2013 those whohave visited and rated the same hotel more than three times \u2013 has a limited impact on ratings;4) responses are longer and sentiment is slightly lower in scenarios where subsequent ratingsare improved, but there is no significant difference in the effect of response speed betweenthe two groups; 5) changes in ratings also affect styles of responding to current reviews \u2013 ifcustomer satisfaction has improved, response length tends to be shorter and sentimentlevel tends to be higher.

In reflecting on Professor Ayreu0027s contributions, we want to extend his ideas on technological change by incorporating the discourses around big data, BDA and business intelligence. With this in mind, we integrate the burgeoning but disjointed streams of research on big data, BDA and business intelligence to develop unified frameworks. Our review takes on both technical and managerial perspectives to explore the complex nature of big data, techniques in big data analytics and utilisation of big data in business and management community. The advanced analytics techniques appear pivotal in bridging big data and business intelligence. The study of advanced analytics techniques and their applications in big data analytics led to identification of promising avenues for future research.",

        "abstract": "On the way towards a sustainable low-carbon future, the design and construction of chemical or physical adsorbents for CO(2) capture and clean energy storage are vital technology. The incorporation of accessible nitrogen-donor sites into the pore walls of porous adsorbents can dramatically affect the CO(2) uptake capacity and selectivity on account of the dipole-quadrupole interactions between the polarizable CO(2) molecule and the accessible nitrogen site. In the present work, a nitrogen-rich rth-type metal-organic framework (MOF) was constructed based on rational design and careful synthesis. The MOF presents exceptionally high uptake capacity not only for CO(2) but also for H(2), which is attributed to favorable interactions between the gas molecules and the nitrogen-rich triazole units of the MOF proved by both experimental measurements and theoretical molecular simulations.",

These transparent MOF crystals present gradually increasing pore sizes upon extension of the length of the organic backbone, as clearly identified by structural analysis and gas-adsorption experiments. The inherent accessibility of the pores to large molecules endows these materials with unique properties for the uptake of large guest molecules. The visible selective adsorption of dye molecules makes these MOFs highly promising porous materials for pore-size-dependent large-molecule capture and separation. ",

        "abstract": "The high activity of exposed facets and large surface area have significant effects on the performance of photocatalysts because most of the photoreactivity properties of materials are related to surface processes. The strategy of combining high-index facets and a hollow structure into one material will provide a new way for designing effective photocatalysts, possessing active exposed facets and a large surface area at the same time. However, fabricating one material with both high-index facets and a hollow structure is still a great challenge due to their thermodynamic instability. Here, hollow anatase TiO octahedrons exposed with high-index (102) facets (HTO-102) were successfully fabricated for the first time by a facile hydrothermal method using HF and HO as morphology controlling agents. Compared with two other catalysts (a solid sharp octahedron with (101) facets (SSO-101) and a hollow sharp octahedron with (101) facets (HSO-101)), HTO-102 particles exhibit a better photochemical activity for the selective aerobic oxidation of organic sulfides under visible-light irradiation. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the excellent photocatalytic activity of HTO-102 particles is mainly due to the synergistic effects of its hollow structure and exposed high-index (102) facets.",

        "abstract": "It is desirable but challenging to design efficient micro-/nanoreactors for chemical reactions. In this study, we fabricated mesoporous double-shelled hollow microreactor composed of N-doped C coated ultiafine In2O3 nanoparticles (N-C/In2O3 HD) by the thermolysis of dodecahedral In-based framworks in Ar atmosphere. The obtained N-C/In2O3 HD exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity toward photocatalytic oxidative hydroxylation of a series of arylboronic acids substrates, due to its enhanced optical absorption and efficient separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs endowed by the unique structure and uniformly coated N-doped C layers. Furthermore, we found that O2\u2219- was the critical active species in the process of photocatalytic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids, and the formation mechanism of this radical was also proposed. The theoretical calculation further confirmed the N-doped C layer acted as electron acceptor and revealed the microscopic charge carrier migration path via the In2O3/N-doped graphite interfaces i.e., the photo-generated electrons from hybrid states of In2O3, composed of In 5s and 2p orbitals, transferred into the hybrid states of N-doped graphite, composed of C 2p and N 2p orbitals. The present study may be helpful for understanding and designing carbon-based micro-/nanoreactors for photocatalytic reactions and can be useful for investigating other relevant micro-/nanoractors as well.",

        "abstract": "The photocatalytic efficiency of titanium oxide (TiO2) has been limited by the degree of visible-light absorption, electron/hole separation and surface reactivity. In this article, N-doped porous carbon incorporating N-doped TiO2 with a butterfly-like structure has been synthesized by using NH2-MIL-125 (Ti), a Ti-based metal\u2013organic framework, as a hard template. The SEM, TEM and AFM observations indicate that the as-synthesized nanocomposites preserve the butterfly-like morphology of the MOF template, which are assembled with two-dimensional (2D) corrugated nanosheets. The EDX and XPS results prove that the composites of the product are small N doped TiO2 particles distributed in the N doped C matrix. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms, UV-Vis spectra and photocurrent density measurements indicate that the N-doped porous carbon incorporating N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles provide several favorable features for photocatalysis: a large BET surface area, visible-light absorption and high charge separation efficiency. As a result, the nanocomposites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity toward selective oxidation of amines to imines. Density functional calculations, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy were used to reveal the mechanism of the photocatalytic process.",

Thus, searching for a simple approach to develop low-cost efficient photocatalysts to improve the utilization ratio of sunlight and boost the photogenerated charge carrier lifetime is very important and challenging. In this article, anchoring Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) in situ on a nitrogen-doped porous carbon yolk\u2013shell cuboctahedral (CNPC) framework has been successfully carried out by direct derivation from a benzimidazole-modified Cu-btc MOF (btc = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate, MOF = metal\u2013organic framework) template. The prepared CNPC showed high photoredox catalysis in forming C\u2013C bond reactions, resulting from the prolonged lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes, multiple reflections of light by the yolk\u2013shell structure, and improved stability and dispersibility of Cu2O NPs.

        "abstract": "It is desirable but challenging to design noble-metal-free photocatalysts with improved activity for hydrogen (H2) evolution. In this study, we fabricated hollow hexagonal porous micro-rods assembled from core\u2013shell In2O3@carbon nanoparticles (PHIC) via one-step thermal decomposition of the In-MIL-68 precursor. Under simulated sun-light illumination, the final H2 yield rate of PHIC is comparable to that of Pt/PHI (PHI, hollow hexagonal micro-rods assembled from In2O3 nanoparticles without a carbon layer), indicating that the continuous carbon layer coating on In2O3 nanoparticles has a Pt-like effect on improving the photocatalytic activity. Our experimental results indicated that the improved photocatalytic H2 evolution of PHIC is attributed to the synergistic effect of efficient separation of photo-generated electron\u2013hole pairs caused by the coating carbon layer, the enhanced optical absorption of the hollow structure, and the improved accessibility provided by the porous structure. Among them, efficient separation of photo-generated electron\u2013hole pairs plays the main role. Furthermore, we reveal the microscopic charge carrier migration path via In2O3/graphite interfaces, meaning that the photo-generated electrons from In2O3 O2p orbitals transfer into the carbon C2p orbitals, leaving the photo-generated holes in In2O3 O2p orbitals, which is beneficial to improve the separation of photo-generated electron\u2013hole pairs.",

One of the most effective methods for this is to engineer suitable interface materials. We develop a simple two-step strategy to engineer a N-doped Cu2O@N\u2013C interface using N-rich MOFs (NTU-105) as templates. The presence of N-rich ligands (H6\u22121) in well-defined cubic MOFs allows the formation of a N-doped porous C matrix hosting well-dispersed N-doped Cu2O. This nanostructure provides several favorable features for photocatalysis: (1) the porous C matrix substrate effectively stabilizes the small Cu2O nanoparticles, preventing their aggregation; (2) the N doping of Cu2O and the C substrate increases their conductivity, which can enhance electron and hole transfer properties; and (3) the uniform distribution of N-doped Cu2O nanoparticles provides abundant highly active catalytic sites. As a result, the N-doped Cu2O@N\u2013C (MCNC) nanoparticles exhibit extraordinary photoredox catalysis in C\u2013C bond forming reactions. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was used to trace the charge carrier dynamics in the N-doped Cu2O@N\u2013C nanoparticles, revealing the fact that high photocatalytic performance relies on long-lived holes.",

A coupled model using the spatial volume integral instead of the Monte Carlo type raytrace technique is proposed to depict ASE in the laser resonators. This model is able to evaluate all possible reflections at both the polishing surface and the diffusive side, to calculate ASE for an inhomogeneous gain distribution, and to include the spectral correction. An experiment is carefully designed to verify the theoretical model and to investigate the distinct physical properties caused by the coupling between ASE and the laser oscillations. The experimental data exhibit an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. According to that model, we confirm that ASE in thin-disk lasers can be characterized approximately by the product of the threshold gain of the resonator and the diameter of the disks, as laser modes are highly overlapped with the pumping beam. Theoretical evaluation shows that the scattering characteristic of the disk side impacts on ASE significantly. Furthermore, we point out that ASE decreases output laser power by affecting threshold pumping power, while slope efficiency is not changed by ASE. This observation provides us with a simple way to estimate the decrease of the optical efficiency by ASE.",

Firstly, the CW amplification property is theoretically analyzed based on the kinetics model for Yb:YAG. To realize high-efficiency laser amplification extraction for RT Yb:YAG, not only intense pump but also a high-power seed laser is of great importance. Experimentally, a composite Yb:YAG crystal slab with three doped and two un-doped segments symmetrically is employed as the gain medium, which is end-pumped by two high-power, 940-nm diode lasers. A high-power, narrow-spectral-width, 1030-nm fiber seed laser then double passes the composite slab to realize efficient power amplification. For 0.8-kW seed input, maximum output power of 3.54 kW is obtained at 6.7 kW of pump power, with the optical conversion efficiency of 41% and the highest slope efficiency of 59%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest power and efficiency reported for Yb:YAG lasing at RT except thin-disk lasers.",

        "abstract": "A direct-liquid-cooled side-pumped Nd:YAG multi-disk QCW laser resonator is presented, in which the oscillating laser propagates through multiple thin disks and cooling flow layers in Brewster angle. Twenty Nd:YAG thin disks side-pumped by LD arrays are directly cooled by flowing deuteroxide at the end surfaces. A laser output with the highest pulse energy of 17.04 J is obtained at the pulse width of 250 \u03bcs and repetition rate of 25 Hz, corresponding to an optical-optical efficiency of 34.1% and a slope efficiency of 44.5%. The maximum average output power of 7.48 kW is achieved at the repetition rate of 500 Hz. Due to thermal effects, the corresponding optical-optical efficiency decreases to 30%. Under the 12.5 kW pumping condition while not oscillating, the wavefront of a He-Ne probe passing through the gain module is as low as 0.256 \u03bcm (RMS) with the defocus and tetrafoil subtracted.

The spectrum broadening employing two different types of narrow linewidth seeds, including the multi-longitudinal-mode seed and the broadened single frequency seed generated by high speed phase modulation, is studied. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that the multi-longitudinal-mode seed experiences serious spectrum broadening induced by the FWM among various longitudinal modes, while the modulated seed can maintain the spectrum profile during the amplifying process even with some noise fluctuation. The different broadening results are mainly caused by the random phase distribution of the multiple waves. It is further explained by an exact solution of the degenerate FWM with three waves. The theoretical predictions on the spectrum and power dependence of the output laser linewidth are in quantitative agreement with the experimental results up to kilowatt.",

        "abstract": "We experimentally investigate the behavior of the mode instability (MI) threshold in the double cladding Yb-doped fiber amplifier when the amplifier is pumped by broad linewidth laser diodes and narrow linewidth laser diodes respectively. It is found that the MI threshold increases by 26% when the amplifier is pumped by the broad linewidth laser diodes. Experiment results show that the MI threshold is affected by the local heat load rather than the average or the total heat load. The calculation shows that the local heat deposit actually plays the key role to stimulate the MI behaviour. At the MI threshold position in the fiber, the local heat deposit also changes dramatically. The effect of the thermal conductivity on the MI threshold is also studied. Our investigation shows that the MI threshold increases from 1269\u00a0W to 1950\u00a0W when the thermal conductivity of the fiber amplifier is increased from 0.3\u00a0W/(m\u00b7K) to 5\u00a0W/(m\u00b7K). Through optimizing the pump linewidth and the cooling efficiency of the gain fiber, the MI threshold is doubled in our experiment.",

The MOPA is seeded by a narrow spectrum random laser with Yb-doped fiber gain and has the spectral broadening-free feature. The narrow spectrum property is sustained during power scaling due to the suppression of nonlinear process. The frequency and time domain of the random laser are well characterized. The proposed one-stage scheme eventually produces 1.105- and 1.073-kW output at 1064 and 1067 nm, and the 3-dB bandwidth are 0.40 and 0.47 nm, corresponding to 0.38- and 0.37-nm random laser seed, respectively. The beam quality of    $text {M}^{2}approx 1.4$    is achieved at 1.105-kW power level, and the proposed MOPA has the potential of wavelength tunability by simply tuning the fiber Bragg grating of random laser seed.",

It is shown that the advantages of the CIFs include few guiding modes, excellent beam quality, large mode area, high optical damage threshold, and high tolerance to fabrication errors. Compared with the conventional single step fiber with the same normalized frequency    $V$   , the mode number of CIFs decreases from dozens to only a few ones and single-mode operation is achievable under certain conditions or with the help of fiber bending. The mode profile of LP 01  is close to Gaussian shape, which guarantees the beam quality to be of nearly diffraction limit. Meanwhile, the mode area increases by 50%\u2013100% depending on different    $V$    values. The maximum power supported by the CIF increases by more than 100%. Finally, 30% fabrication errors on the refractive index and the ring thicknesses have only a little influence on the mode properties of CIFs, which is favorable in practical application.",

We point out that the essential difficulty is to lock the phase of an individual wave in the three-wave-mixing process. The phase evolution law in an optical parametric amplifier for both cases of phase matching and quasi-phase matching is studied theoretically. The results indicate that, under the condition of strong pumping, a higher intensity injection signal can lock its phase to be its initial value, while for a weaker injection signal the phases of the signal and idler waves exhibit chaos-like evolution. Based on this understanding, we propose a ring configuration for an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) with the appropriate intensity seed injection. The numerical studies indicate this OPO configuration can achieve phase-locking and wavelength-locking simultaneously. This inspires a possible design to achieve CBC for OPOs.",

        "abstract": "Resin embedding is widely used and facilitates microscopic imaging of biological tissues. In contrast, quenching of fluorescence during embedding process hinders the application of resin embedding for imaging of fluorescence-labeled samples. For samples expressing fluorescent proteins, it has been demonstrated that the weakened fluorescence could be recovered by reactivating the fluorophore with alkaline buffer. We extended this idea to immunofluorescence-labeling technology. We showed that the fluorescence of pH-sensitive fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was quenched after resin embedding but reactivated after treating by alkaline buffer. We observed 138.5% fluorescence preservation ratio of reactivated state, sixfold compared with the quenched state in embedding resin, which indicated its application for fluorescence imaging of high signal-to-background ratio. Furthermore, we analyzed the chemical reactivation mechanism of FITC fluorophore. This work would show a way for high-resolution imaging of immunofluorescence-labeled samples embedded in resin.",

        "abstract": "In the so-called surface microscopy, serial block-face imaging is combined with mechanic sectioning to obtain volumetric imaging. While mapping a resin-embedded green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled specimen, it has been recently reported that an alkaline buffer is used to chemically reactivate the protonated GFP molecules, and thus improve the signal-to-noise ratio. In such a procedure, the image quality is highly affected by the penetration rate of a solution. We propose a reliable penetration model to describe the penetration process of the solution into the resin. The experimental results are consistent with the parameters predicted using this model. Thus, this model provides a valuable theoretical explanation and aids in optimizing the system parameters for mapping resin-embedded GFP biological samples.",

Recently, it has been reported that resin-embedded GFP-labeled brain tissue can be imaged with high resolution. In this protocol, we describe an optimized protocol for resin embedding and chemical reactivation of fluorescent protein labeled mouse brain, we have used mice as experiment model, but the protocol should be applied to other species. This method involves whole brain embedding and chemical reactivation of the fluorescent signal in resin-embedded tissue. The whole brain embedding process takes a total of 7 days. The duration of chemical reactivation is ~2 min for penetrating 4 \u03bcm below the surface in the resin-embedded brain. This protocol provides an efficient way to prepare fluorescent protein labeled sample for high-resolution optical imaging. This kind of sample was demonstrated to be imaged by various optical micro-imaging methods. Fine structures labeled with GFP across a whole brain can be detected.",

        "abstract": "Parsing diverse nerve cells into biological types is necessary for understanding neural circuit organization. Morphology is an intuitive criterion for neuronal classification and a proxy of connectivity, but morphological diversity and variability often preclude resolving the granularity of discrete cell groups from population continuum. Combining genetic labeling with high-resolution, large volume light microscopy, we established a platform of genetic single neuron anatomy that resolves, registers and quantifies complete neuron morphologies in the mouse brain. We discovered that cortical axo-axonic cells (AACs), a cardinal GABAergic interneuron type that controls pyramidal neuron (PyN) spiking at axon initial segment, consist of multiple subtypes distinguished by laminar  position, dendritic and axonal arborization patterns. Whereas the laminar arrangements of AAC dendrites reflect differential recruitment by input streams, the laminar distribution and local geometry of AAC axons enable differential innervation of PyN ensembles. Therefore, interneuron types likely consist of fine-grained subtypes with distinct input-output connectivity patterns.",

Here a novel stage-scanning confocal microscopy was developed for rapid imaging of large tissues. Line scanning methods and strip imaging strategy were used to increase the imaging speed. The scientific CMOS was used as line detector in sub-array mode and the optical sectioning ability can be easily adjusted by changing the number of line detectors according to different samples. Fluorescent beads imaging showed resolutions of 0.47 \u03bcm, 0.56 \u03bcm, and 1.56 \u03bcm in the X, Y, and Z directions, respectively, with a 40 \u00d7 objective lens. A 10 \u00d7 10 mm(2) coronal plane with enough signal intensity could be imaged in about 88 sec at a sampling resolution of 0.16 \u03bcm/pixel. Rapid imaging of mouse brain slices demonstrated the applicability of this system in visualizing neuronal details at high frame rate. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Twittersphere often offers valuable information about current events. However, despite the enormous quantity of tweets regarding online retailing, we know little about customersu0027 perceptions regarding the products and services offered by online retail brands. Therefore, this study focuses on analysing brand-related tweets associated with five leading UK online retailers during the most important sales period of the year, covering Black Friday, Christmas and the New Yearu0027s sales events. We explore trends in customer tweets by utilising a combination of data analytics approaches including time series analysis, sentiment analysis and topic modelling to analyse the trends of tweet volume and sentiment and to understand the reasons underlying changes in sentiment. Through the sentiment and time series analyses, we identify several critical time points that lead to significant deviations in sentiment trends. We then use a topic modelling approach to examine the tweets in the period leading up to and following these critical moments to understand what exactly drives these changes in sentiment. The study provides a deeper understanding of online retailing customer behaviour and derives significant managerial insights that are useful for improving online retailing service provision.",

        "abstract": "Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a renewable energy technology that could make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation. Despite early recognition of its potential role within a diverse low-carbon energy mix in the UK, the on-farm AD sector has stubbornly refused to grow beyond the u0027early adopteru0027 stage at a time when some other European countries, notably Germany, recorded a huge expansion in uptake. This research investigates the experiences of early adopters in South West England, and examines the factors in making on-farm AD a viable renewable energy enterprise. The findings, drawn from six case studies, indicate that land, labour and capital resource-related requirements, along with significant regulatory and financial barriers, are together a huge hurdle to clear before a would-be on-farm AD plant operator can be confident that a viable business enterprise will result from investment.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the influence of temperature on the ability of the mixotrophic flagellate Ochromonas to eliminate a toxic Microcystis population and degrade microcystins. We exposed Microcystis to cultures with or without Ochromonas YZ1 at 20, 25, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C for 10 days. Results showed that increased temperature promoted the growth of Ochromonas YZ1 and Microcystis, with the latter achieving high abundance without grazing. With increased temperature, Ochromonas YZ1 clearance rate increased, and Microcystis populations were earlier eliminated. Importantly, Ochromonas YZ1 degraded both intracellular and extracellular microcystins by grazing effects. The reduction ratios of Microcystis abundances and microcystins were both approximately 100% after 6 days at high temperature. In addition, more microcystins were released outside at 20\u00a0\u00b0C than at the higher temperatures. Overall, this study showed that high temperature favors elimination of toxin-producing Microcystis and degradation of microcystins by mixotrophic Ochromonas.",

        "abstract": "The elongation growth of the mushroom stipe is a characteristic but not well-understood morphogenetic event of Basidiomycetes. We found that extending native stipe cell walls of  were associated with the release of N-acetylglucosamine and chitinbiose and with chitinase activity. Two chitinases, ChiE1 and ChiIII, among all detected chitinases from  reconstituted heat-inactivated stipe wall extension and released N-acetylglucosamine and chitinbiose. Interestingly, both ChiE1 and ChiIII hydrolyze insoluble crystalline chitin powder while other  chitinases do not, suggesting that crystalline chitin components of the stipe cell wall are the target of action for ChiE1 and ChiIII. ChiE1- or ChiIII-reconstituted heat-inactivated stipe walls showed maximal extension activity at pH 4.5, consistent with the optimal pH for native stipe wall extension in vitro; ChiE1- or ChiIII-reconstituted heat-inactivated stipe wall extension activities were associated with stipe elongation growth regions; combination of ChiE1 and ChiIII showed a synergism to reconstitute heat-inactivated stipe wall extension at a low action concentration. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images explored that the inner surface of acid-induced extended native stipe cell walls and ChiE1- or ChiIII-reconstituted extended heat-inactivated stipe cell walls exhibited a partially broken parallel microfibril architecture, however, this broken transversely arranged microfibrils were not observed in the unextended stipe cell walls that were induced by neutral pH buffer or heat-inactivated. Double knockdown of ChiE1 and ChiIII resulted in the reduction of stipe elongation, mycelium growth, and heat-sensitive cell wall extension of native stipes. Above results indicate a chitinase-hydrolyzing mechanism for stipe cell wall extension.A remarkable feature in the development of basidiomycete fruiting bodies is stipe elongation growth that results primarily from manifold cell elongation. Some scientists have suggested that stipe elongation is the result of enzymatic hydrolysis of cell wall polysaccharides, while other scientists have proposed that stipe elongation results from the nonhydrolytic disruption of the hydrogen bonds between cell wall polysaccharides. Here, we show direct evidences for a chitinase-hydrolyzing mechanism of stipe cell wall elongation in the model mushroom  which is different from the expansin non-hydrolysis mechanism of plant cell wall extension. We presumed that in the growing stipe cell walls, parallel chitin microfibrils are tethered by \u03b2-1,6-branched \u03b2-1,3-glucans and that the breaking of the tether by chitinases leads to separation of these microfibrils to increase their spacing for insertion of new synthesized chitin and \u03b2-1,3-glucans under turgor pressure in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Osmoregulation plays an important role in the migration process of catadromous fish. The osmoregulatory mechanisms of tropical marbled eel (Anguilla marmorata), a typical catadromous fish, did not gain sufficient attention, especially at the molecular level. In order to enrich the protein database of A. marmorata, a proteomic analysis has been carried out by iTRAQ technique. Among 1937 identified proteins in gill of marbled eel, the expression of 1560 proteins (80 %) was quantified. Compared with the protein expression level in the gill of marbled eel in freshwater (salinity of 0 \u2030), 336 proteins were up-regulated and 67 proteins were down-regulated in seawater (salinity of 25 \u2030); 33 proteins were up-regulated and 32 proteins were down-regulated in brackish water (salinity of 10 \u2030). These up-regulated proteins including Na+/K+-ATPase, V-type proton ATPase, sodium\u2013potassium\u2013chloride co-transporter and heat shock protein 90 were enriched in many KEGG-annotated pathways, which are related to different functions of the gill. The up-regulated oxidative phosphorylation and seleno-compound metabolism pathways involve the synthesis and consumption of ATP, which represents extra energy consumption. Another identified pathway is the ribosome pathway in which a large number of up-regulated proteins are involved. It is also more notable that tight junction and cardiac muscle contraction pathways may have correlation with ion transport in gill cells. This is the first report describing the proteome of A. marmorata for acclimating to the change of salinity. These results provide a functional database for migratory fish and point out some possible new interactions on osmoregulation in A. marmorata.",

To investigate the changes of the two genes under different salinity environments, we first identified NKA (AmNKA\u03b11) and FXYD11 (AmFXYD11) in Anguilla marmorata, and then evaluated the mRNA levels of NKA and FXYD11 as well as the activity of NKA in the gill and kidney at different timepoints (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 360\u00a0h) under three salinity conditions-0\u2030 (fresh water: FW), 10\u2030 (brackish water: BW), and 25\u2030 (seawater: SW). In the gill, the mRNA levels of AmNKA\u03b11 and AmFXYD11 and the enzyme activity of AmNKA\u03b11 were higher in BW and SW than in FW; the protein abundance was positively correlated with the specific activity of NKA in BW/SW. However, in the kidney, the mRNA level of AmNKA\u03b11 in the BW group was higher than that in the FW group. In addition, AmFXYD mRNA levels in both BW and SW groups were significantly lower than that in the FW control group. These results suggested that AmFXYD11 was tissue specific in response to different salinity environment. Our results clearly demonstrated the important roles of AmNKA\u03b11 and AmFXYD11 in osmotic homeostasis of juvenile A. marmorata under saline environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a hierarchical control framework for implementing primary frequency control (PFC) by using residential heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) loads. The proposed control system consists of a load aggregator, a central controller, and a group of local controllers. The load aggregator is responsible for managing a population of HVAC loads as a virtual generator to participate in primary reserve (PR) market. The central controller dispatches the HVAC loads by assigning a triggering frequency to each HVAC load. A temperature-priority-list method is applied to avoid frequent switching on/off HVAC units when implementing PFC. The local controllers determine the ON/OFF status of HVAC units autonomously based on their triggering frequencies. A self-adjustment algorithm is proposed to correct the error in the assigned triggering frequency by considering minimum ON/OFF time of HVAC units. The proposed control framework can significantly reduce the communication needs. The simulation results indicate that by adopting the proposed control framework, one can dispatch HVAC units more efficiently at the central control level while achieve fast response at the local control level.",

        "abstract": "When an extreme weather event strikes a distribution system, it is helpful to use microgrids to restore the interrupted critical loads. Due to the relatively small capacity and low inertia of distributed generators (DGs), the switching operations during the restoration process may cause severe fluctuations in voltage, current, and frequency, leading to prime-mover stalling or triggering protection relays. It is essential to investigate the dynamic characteristics of DGs during the restoration procedure. The dynamic models of different types of DGs are developed to analyse the dynamic characteristics. Analytical constraints on the dynamic performance of DGs are obtained from the simulation results, which can be incorporated into the optimisation models of critical load restoration problems. The modified IEEE 32-bus test feeder is simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In the presence of IL-1\u03b2, 5 and 10\u00a0% stretching increased the production of MMP2, whereas 15\u00a0% stretching increased the production of MMP9.

However, the mechanistic link between inflammatory molecules and MMPs in the pathogenesis of keratoconus remains still elusive. Therefore, we investigated the effect of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) on MMP-1 expression and used IL-6 antibody (IL-6 Ab) to examine the role of IL-6 on TNF-\u03b1 mediated regulation of MMP-1 in fibroblasts of normal cornea and keratoconus. Real-time polymerase chain reaction, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot data demonstrated that MMP-1 and IL-6 were expressed in fibroblasts of normal cornea and keratoconus. Levels of MMP-1 and IL-6 were significantly higher in keratoconus than normal cornea. TNF-\u03b1 treatment led to a significant increase in IL-6 levels. IL-6 treatment induced MMP-1 synthesis in normal cornea and keratoconus. TNF-\u03b1 increased MMP-1 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner and thi...",

        "abstract": "This work aims to create a mathematical model by using kinematical equations that can describe the landing-jump of a trampoline performance. In this model, the trampolinist was assumed to be a combination of two parts of masses. The landing process (from the time trampolinist touches the net to the deepest location) was discretized into two stages. During these two stages, the trampolinist exerts different internal forces. Analyzing the kinematics of the abovementioned two stages, we obtained the numerical solutions for the optimum loading time and loading force of the trampolinist to get the deepest landing location. This work has potential for guiding a trampolinist in developing his/her personalized optimal strategy for exerting force during landing on the trampoline.",

Molten steel temperature prediction is important in Ladle Furnace (LF). Most of the existing temperature models have been built on small-scale data. The accuracy and the generalization of these models cannot satisfy industrial production. Now, the large-scale data with more useful information are accumulated from the production process. However, the data are with noise. Large-scale and noise data impose strong restrictions on building a temperature model. To solve these two issues, the Bootstrap Feature Subsets Ensemble Regression Trees (BFSE-RTs) method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, low-dimensional feature subsets are constructed based on the multivariate fuzzy Taylor theorem, which saves more memory space in computers and indicates ``smaller-scale'' data sets are used. Secondly, to eliminate the noise, the bootstrap sampling approach of the independent identically distributed data is applied to the feature subsets. Bootstrap replications consist of smaller-scale and lower-dimensional samples. Thirdly, considering its simplicity, a Regression Tree (RT) is built on each bootstrap replication. Lastly, the BFSE-RTs method is used to establish a temperature model by analyzing the metallurgic process of LF. Experiments demonstrate that the BFSE-RTs outperforms other estimators, improves the accuracy and the generalization, and meets the requirements of the RMSE and the maximum error on the temperature prediction.",

        "abstract": "\nTo control the molten steel temperature in a Ladle Furnace accurately, it is necessary to build a precise (i.e. accurate and good generalized) temperature prediction model. To solve this problem, ensemble modeling methods have been applied to predict the temperature. Now, in the production process, large-scale data with more helpful information are sampled, which provides possibilities to improve the precision of the temperature prediction. Although most of the existing ensemble temperature models have strong learning ability, they are not suitable for the large-scale data. In this paper, to solve the large-scale issue, the Tree-Structure Ensemble General Regression Neural Networks (TSE-GRNNs) method is proposed. Firstly, small-scale sample subsets are constructed based on the regression tree algorithm. Secondly, GRNN sub-models are built on sample subsets, which can be designed very quickly and cannot converge to poor solutions according to local minima of the error criterion. Then, the TSE-GRNNs method is applied to establish a temperature model. Experiments show that the TSE-GRNNs temperature model is more precise than the other existing temperature models, and meets the requirements of the RMSE and the maximum error of the molten steel temperature prediction in Ladle Furnace.\n",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an improved correlation-based just-in-time modeling method, referring to as the ICoJIT, for improving the prediction accuracy and real-time performance of the conventional correlation-based just-in-time (CoJIT) modeling method. To achieve this objective, a novel adaptive local domain partition method has been developed based on the moving window technique and the fitting precision, which takes into account the input and output information simultaneously and has potentially the capabilities of obtaining the optimal local domain partition adaptively and capturing new process states by adding new local domains. Utilizing dynamic partial least squares and adaptive local domain partition method, multiple local domains and corresponding local models can be obtained during the offline operation stage. So online computation burden is reduced compared to CoJIT modeling method. In addition, the proposed ICoJIT modeling method can efficiently deal with nonlinearity and time-varying behavior of processes as well as the CoJIT modeling method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a real industrial process dataset in sulfur recovery unit process.",

To solve these issues, based on the multivariate fuzzy Taylor theorem, the Feature Subsets Ensemble (FSE) method has been proposed. However, data sampled from measurements have noise. The FSE uses the entire data set at least once, and for data with noise this property may reduce the generalization of Mach number prediction. In this paper, a Modified Feature Subsets Ensemble (MFSE) method is proposed to overcome the limitation of the FSE on noisy data by introducing the bootstrap to the feature subsets. The bootstrap has the potential to avoid noise. In addition, the generating procedure of the bootstrap replications is straightforward, simple, and quick, which keeps the complexity of the MFSE low. Experiments show that the MFSE outperforms the FSE and the Random Forest method, particularly on high-noise data sets. For all three working conditions, on both the low- and the high-noise testing sets, only the MFSE estimator meets the requirements of forecasting speed, accuracy, and generalization of Mach number prediction.",

To obtain pure HDS for application in food or pharmaceutical industries, the prehydrolysis liquor (PHL) must be refined to remove non-saccharide compounds (NSC) derived from lignin depolymerization and carbohydrate degradation. In this work, activated carbon (AC) adsorption was employed to purify HDS from NSC with emphasis on adsorption selectivity. The adsorption isotherms showed the priority of NSC to be absorbed over HDS at low AC level. However, increase of AC over 90% of NSC removal made adsorption non-selective due to competitive adsorption between NSC and HDS. Size exclusion chromatography showed that the adsorption of oligomeric HDS was dominant while monomeric HDS was inappreciable. The limited selectivity suggested that AC adsorption is infeasibility for HDS purification, but applicable as a pretreatment method.",

The residual NSOC and calcium ions in lime-treated PHL were eliminated by mixed bed ion exchange. The breakthrough curves of HDS and NSOC showed selective retention toward NSOC, leading to 75% HDS recovery with 95% purity at 17 bed volumes of exchange capacity.

        "abstract": "Pseudo-lignin induced by high-severity dilute acid treatment of lignocellulose has been widely studied because of its detrimental effect on enzymatic hydrolysis. However, cooling-induced pseudo-lignin (CIPL) formed during the cooling process after treatment has always been ignored and never been characterized systematically. To investigate the formation and chemistry of CIPL, liquid hot water treatments of poplar wood were conducted. Samples of treated wood and hydrolysate were taken out from digester at various temperatures during the cooling process for characterization. SEM images evidenced a progressive deposition of CIPL on the surface of the treated wood during cooling process with a yield of 19.6 mg/g treated wood. However, the treated wood which was collected isothermally at reaction temperature showed no pseudo-lignin. Variation of organic compounds in hydrolysate from lignocellulose degradation during cooling process revealed that depolymerized lignin and furfural accounted for 80.4 and 10.6 % of CIPL, respectively, while soluble saccharides from carbohydrate hydrolysis were independent from CIPL formation. These findings stress the importance of isothermal separation of treated wood and hydrolysate. Otherwise, CIPL should hinder enzymatic hydrolysis for biofuels production or delignification for cellulosic fiber production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Prehydrolysis liquor (PHL) of wood is a byproduct of dissolving pulp from prehydrolysis kraft process, but contains a great amount of soluble hemicelluloses. Membrane filtration of PHL is a promising method for hemicelluloses recovery but extremely difficult mostly due to high fouling tendency. In this study, flocculation was employed to reduce fouling of regenerated cellulose (RC) membranes. The results showed that flocculation by polyaluminium chloride (PAC) at 500\u00a0mg/L prior to microfiltration improved the flux over 102 folds for a volume reduction factor of 10. The flux was further increased by 81.2% by addition of anionic polyacrylamide (APAM) at 50\u00a0mg/L. However, combination of PAC and cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) aggravated membrane fouling due to the adhesion of CPAM on membranes. Variation of chemical compositions revealed that lipophilic substances and lignin were key foulants for RC membranes.",

The properties (i.e., surface area, pore size distribution, hydrogen and deuterium adsorption capacities, etc.) of the carbon aerogels were affected by the polymer templates. The results showed that the carbon aerogel with the molar ratio of polyacrylic acid (PAA) to zinc chloride (ZnCl2) being 0.75:40 was featured the highest surface area (1806 m2/g) and had the highest hydrogen adsorption capacity.

Due to the 3D axial-symmetric microfluidic device, a more stable and robust flow field was maintained to obtain a continuous and regular emulsification. Various factors were systematically investigated for the precise size control of dripping in confined channel geometry, such as outlet channel size, fluid properties and flow rates. It was seen that phase properties and synergistic effects of main factors played key roles in determining droplet size. Thus, we used the optimized microfluidic approach to fabricate predetermined size foams to satisfy inertial fusion energy experiments, ranging from 4 to 4.6mm in diameter with a 50\u2013300\u03bcm wall thickness and a coefficient of variation u003c0.5%.

        "abstract": "We demonstrated a practical microfluidic approach to fabricate extremely monodisperse millimeter-sized poly(divinylbenzene) (PDVB) foam shells with the comparable double emulsion templates. At millimeter scale, the emulsification process was more complex and more difficult to control due to the very large characteristic sizes and velocities. A new kind of three-dimension co-axial microfluidic chip including a Y-shaped compound channels was designed to maintain more stable and robust flow field and regular emulsification. The hydrodynamic features of the double-emulsion droplet formation were investigated. The results showed perfect encapsulation and continuous emulsification could be obtained by one-step dripping (Caouter \u2208 (0.018,0.09)). The size of the outlet channel would be comparable with the target droplet. Besides, droplet diameters could similarly be plotted as a function of capillary number close to the general microfluidic ones. After photo-polymerization and supercritical drying, spherical and concentric PDVB foam shells were obtained to satisfy the inertial fusion energy experiments with large diameter (3\u20135.45 mm), thin wall thickness (50\u2013250 \u03bcm), low density (50\u2013300 mg/cm3), and a less than 0.1% polydispersity.

We studied the effects of monomer concentrations and illumination\n times on the density, shrinkage, surface area, porosity characteristics, and compression properties of PDVB shells. It was found that actual densities, shrinkages, and surface areas of PDVB shells varied from 70 to 210\u00a0mg/cm, 8.5 to 15.2\u00a0%, and 457 to 848\u00a0m/g, respectively, with the changes of monomer concentrations and illumination times. The analytic results of nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms indicated that the mesoporous structures of PDVB shells were affected by monomer concentrations and illumination times. Moreover, the photopolymerization of DVB monomers was essentially a solvent polymerization. The phase separation process induced the formation of pore structures. Different morphologies of the inwall and outwall of PDVB shells were obtained. Furthermore, a reasonable growth mechanism of PDVB shells was proposed.",

        "abstract": "The synthesis of a layered Ln2(OH)4SO4\u00b7nH2O material (Ln-241) with a smaller lanthanide ion (Dy3+) was successfully achieved through the optimization of the hydrothermal conditions, and the effect of lanthanide contraction on the chemical composition, phase structure, and crystallite/particle morphology of the products was investigated and discussed. Structure refinement showed that the lattice parameters (a, b, and c), cell volume, and axis angle across the series (Ln = La\u2013Dy) monotonously decrease as the size of Ln3+ decreases. Comparative TG/DTA analysis in air indicated that the dehydroxylation temperature of Ln-241 tends to increase, whereas the dehydration and desulfurization temperatures decrease as the size of Ln3+ decreases, thus narrowing the stable temperature range for Ln2O2SO4. Taking advantage of the fact that Ln-241 has exactly the same Ln/S molar ratio as Ln2O2SO4 and Ln2O2S, the latter two groups of important compounds (excluding Ce) were facilely transformed from the former via the removal of water by calcination. The photoluminescence properties of Eu3+ and Tb3+, in terms of excitation, emission, fluorescence decay, quantum yield, and emission color, were investigated and compared for the two hosts Gd2O2S and Gd2O2SO4, and the (Gd0.99Tb0.01)2O2S phosphor was shown to be stable under electron beam irradiation in the studied range and exhibited an increasingly higher emission brightness as the acceleration voltage (up to 7 kV) or beam current (up to 50 \u03bcA) increased.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In online learning, the contribution of old samples to a model decreases as time passes, and old samples gradually become invalid. Although the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) can avoid the repetitive training of old samples, invalid samples are still used, which goes against improving the accuracy of an OS-ELM model. The Online Sequence Extreme Learning Machine with Forgetting Mechanism (FOS-ELM) timely discards invalid samples, but it does not consider the differences among valid samples and then has\u00a0the limitation on boosting the accuracy and generalization. To solve this issue, the Memory Degradation Based OS-ELM (MDOS-ELM) is proposed in this paper. The MDOS-ELM adjusts the weights of the old and new samples in real time by a self-adaptive memory factor, and simultaneously discards invalid samples. The self-adaptive memory factor is determined by two elements. One is the similarity between the new and old samples, and the other is the prediction errors of the current training samples on the previous model. The performance of the proposed MDOS-ELM is validated on both regression and classification datasets which include an artificial dataset and twenty-two real-world dataset. The results demonstrate that the MDOS-ELM model outperforms the OS-ELM and the FOS-ELM models on the accuracy and generalization.",

But with the increase of number of the reaction strands, the basic logic gates cannot meet the accuracy in the reaction process. This paper improved the logical unit OR gate, AND gate to solve this problem on the basic of the seesaw model and the mechanism of DNA strand displacement reaction. Since the basic circuit of the decoder is an array of AND gates, the improvement module is applied to the decoder. The molecular circuit of decoder is constructed to realize the dynamic link between the input signal and the output signal. It is concluded that the sensitivity and accuracy of the improved decoder in the molecular circuit is improved by the Visual DSD software. The improvement module laid the foundation for the development of molecular circuits.",

        "abstract": "We report an experimental study of the assembly of various multicompartment and multigeometry nanoparticles constructed from mixtures of two diblock copolymers. By simply blending the amphiphilic block copolymers poly(acrylic acid)-block-polyisoprene (PAA-b-PI) and poly(acrylic acid)-block-polystyrene (PAA-b-PS), we constructed complex nanostructures including multigeometry vesicle\u2013cylinder particles, multicompartment vesicles, or multigeometry cylinder\u2013disk nanoparticles via kinetic control of solution assembly. In our assembly strategy, the PAA common domain in both block copolymers was first complexed with organic diamine molecules in organic solution to form a particle core. Therefore, the two different hydrophobic blocks from the two different polymers were trapped into the same particle. After addition of water, the particles form the structure having hydrophobic cores and PAA-amine hydrophilic shells; the two hydrophobic domains locally nanophase-separated in the core to form the multicompartment a...",

        "abstract": "\nThe saturated aliphatic binary carboxylic acid, including succinic acid, adipic acid and sebacic acid, were used to improve the curing process of unsaturated polyester resin (UPR), and the effect of chain length of acid on the curing thermodynamics and kinetics of UPR was investigated. The analysis of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) showed that the pre-esterification between the various binary carboxylic acids and dihydric alcohol in UPR proceeded with the same activity and that the molecular chain of saturated polyester generated in the process became longer as the chain length of the binary carboxylic acid increased. The curing thermodynamics of UPR was detected by isothermal DSC, and the curing dynamics was analyzed by non-isothermal DSC. The saturated aliphatic binary carboxylic acid showed different mechanism from the previous inhibitor and retarder making the free radical inactive, and the generated polyester performed steric effect on the curing process of UPR. The Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G) of UPR curing increased from \u2212297.4 to \u2212263.4\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121, indicating the reduction in curing tendency of UPR. The activation energy (E) of the UPR in curing process increased from 80.85 to 90.29\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 with the increase in the chain length of saturated aliphatic binary carboxylic acid. The acceleration of energy barrier made the UPR curing retard, the curing time was prolonged from 21.52 to 32.36\u00a0min, and the curing degree decreased from 0.92 to 0.70. Saturated aliphatic binary carboxylic acid made improvements in the curing thermodynamics and kinetics of the UPR, and a dual chemical effect of hindering and retarding mechanism was proposed, different from the previous single effect of inhibitor or retarder.",

The aim of this study was to review patient's records with respect to clinical manifestation, CT scan findings, and operative outcomes.From April 2009 to January 2015, six female patients with incarcerated obturator hernia underwent urgent operation for acute intestinal obstruction. The medical records were reviewed with respect to clinical manifestation, findings of CT scan and the outcomes of operation.The median age of patients was 83 years (range, 79-87 years) and the body mass index was 21.61 \u00b1 0.52 kg/m(2). CT scans of abdomen demonstrated that intestinal obstruction secondary to obturator hernia, consistency with operative findings. Partial bowel resection was performed in two of six patients because of necrosis of incarcerated obturator hernia. The hernia was repaired with interrupted sutures. Lung infection occurred in one patient, and wound infection in another. One recurrence was observed and two patients died from the unrelated diseases during the period of follow-up.The diagnosis of obturator hernia can be made by CT scan preoperatively, and the obturator hernia should be suspected when an unexplained bowel obstruction in elderly, thin women occurs.",

        "abstract": "A novel and sensitive magnetic ionic liquid-based up-and-down-shaker-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (MIL-UDSA-DLLME) was developed for the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometric measurement of inorganic selenium speciation from various rice matrixes. In the first microextraction step, the magnetic ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrate, [C4mim][FeCl4]) was selected to extract the complex of Se(IV) and 2,3-diaminonaphthalene from aqueous solution by the assistance of up-and-down-shaker vortex agitator. After the microextraction step, the magnetic ionic liquid containing target analytes was collected at the bottom of the tube by applying an external magnetic field around the test tube. Under the optimized conditions, the method present has low detection limit (0.018 \u03bcg L\u22121), wide linear dynamic range (0.03\u201310 \u03bcg L\u22121), and good repeatability (u003c3.0%, n = 10) for Se(IV). The proposed methodology was applied for separation and preconcentration of inorganic selenium in standard reference materials including GBW10010 rice, GBW10043 Liaoning rice, and GBW10045 Hunan rice with satisfactory results. The developed methodology was also successfully used for the speciation of Se(IV) and Se(VI) in different rice samples with the relative recoveries within the acceptable range of 94.9\u2013104.8% for the addition recovery tests.",

This highly efficient separation method combines the advantages of magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) and air-assisted liquid\u2013liquid microextraction (AALLME) for the first time.

The variables of interest in the MIL\u2013AALLME method, such as pH values, amounts of chelating agent, types and amounts of MIL, salt effect and number of extraction cycles were assessed and optimized systematically. Under optimal extraction conditions, the MIL\u2013AALLME method provided a good linear dynamic range (LDR) in the range of 0.04\u201310.0 \u03bcg L\u22121 and the determination coefficient was 0.9991. Using the present method, the limit of detection (LOD) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) for seven replicate measurements of 2.0 \u03bcg L\u22121 of As(III) was 0.029 \u03bcg L\u22121 and 2.5%, respectively. The developed methodology was successfully used for inorganic arsenic speciation studies in different environmental water, sediment and soil samples with satisfactory results ranging from 93.0 to 108.5% for the spiked samples. In order to confirm the accuracy of MIL\u2013AALLME, five standard reference materials such as GBW08605 simulated natural water and GBW07309 sediment were analyzed, and the analyzed values found by using the present methodology were in statistic agreement with the certified values.",

A special effervescent tablet composed of magnetic ionic liquids and carbon dioxide sources was used for combining extractant dispersion and highly selective microextraction procedures into only one single step. In the ETA-MILs-ME step, highly selective separation of As(V) was achieved by chelation with ammonium molybdate followed by dispersion with 65\u202f\u03bcL of magnetic ionic liquids. As(III) is not extracted at the same pH conditions and remained in the aqueous layer. After microextraction and phase separation by magnetic separation technology, the enriched As(V) in the magnetic ionic liquids was determined by GFAAS. The variables of interest in the ETA-MILs-ME procedure that affect the microextraction efficiency, such as the amount of the magnetic ionic liquids, composition of effervescent tablets, pH value of sample solution, amount of ammonium molybdate and matrix interference were systematically investigated. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the proposed methodology achieved 0.007\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL \u22121  detection of limit and 97.9\u2013105.8% recovery for As(V) at addition recovery tests.

In recent years, with the development of stealth technology, directly through the radar to detect ship targets in complex sea background, has become more and more difficult. In this context, many scholars have turned to wake of the motion ship or submarine. Ship wake electromagnetic scattering characteristics analysis and corresponding remote sensing technology have become one of the important research directions in the field of marine remote sensing and military target detection. Research on ship wake electromagnetic scattering properties is the theoretical basis of the ship motion target recognition, which has the important theory value for radar imaging. In this paper, firstly, we established target scattering model which includes sea surface model and wake model. The random sea surface using the Pierson-Moskowitz type wave spectrum is generated. The wake models consist of Kelvin wake model, narrow V wake model and internal wave wake model. Second, we choose Kirchhoff resident phase method to calculate the rough surface and analysis the polarization characteristics of target scattering. Third, the simulations in different sea levels with or without sea wake are presented. Last, the suitable method for the orientation detection of wake is discussed for the searching task.",

        "abstract": "Recent diverse applications on ocean wave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have a potential demand for individual facet scattering contribution rather than the total average radar cross-section (RCS) by statistical scattering models. However, only a few facet methods have been proposed and fewer have considered shadowing effects, which are thought to be non-negligible at large incident angle. In view of this, we proposed an angular composite facet model (ACFM) with shadowing treatment to investigate the backscattering from two-dimensional rough sea surface. First, a region division formula for ACFM without shadowing treatment is proposed to classified sea surface facets into specular facets and diffusion facets based on which kind of scattering is dominate from each facet, and the corresponding scattering contribution is calculated either by Kirchhoff approximation (KA) or by a small perturbation method (SPM) with a tilting process. Second, an electromagnetic shadowing algorithm based on facets grouping is adopted to handle the shadowing effects in a geometric manner with moderate computation complexity gained. Finally, comparisons between numerical backscattering evaluations and experimental data demonstrate that this new ACFM can attain accurate numerical results and the geometric facets grouping method is a practical way to tackle shadowing effects despite a certain acceptable gap. Therefore, the whole ACFM can simulate ocean wave SAR imaging, especially for those electrically large surfaces and to evaluate the scattering from sea surface with different local nature, such as sea spikes, foams, spilled oil, swells, and ship wake.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study investigated the microstructure and anisotropic mechanical properties of selective laser melting (SLM) processed Inconel 718 (IN718) component. In as-fabricated alloys, ultrafine columnar grained microstructure with highly dispersed precipitates \u03b3 phases at grains boundary and even-distributed \u03b3u0027 phases inside the grains were observed. It was demonstrated that the as-fabricated longitudinal samples showed lower ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 1101\u00a0MPa but higher elongation of 24.5% compared to the transverse samples which showed UTS of 1167\u00a0MPa and elongation of 21.5%. The excellent mechanical properties of both the longitudinal and transverse samples can be ascribed to the refined microstructure of the SLM material resulting from the high cooling rate imposed by laser processing. The anisotropy in strength and ductility was attributed to the {100} fiber texture and columnar grain morphology. The {100} fiber texture of columnar grains leads to high strength in transverse direction, while the columnar grain boundaries also served as a path along which damage can preferentially accumulate, leading to fracture.",

        "abstract": "Due to non-ideal conditions in the measurements of the wireless channel, high initial bit error rate (BER) in the preliminary key is resulted, which reduces the final secret key generation rate and even causes the secret key generation process fail. Aiming to resolve this problem, we first present and verify an optimal information reconciliation protocol; the validation experiment shows that not only the BER comes down more quickly, but also a higher information rate is achieved. Then, to address the problem of very high initial BER and further improve the efficiency of the secret key generation, we introduce the idea of pre-distillation into the secret key generation system, and present a pre-distillation method, which makes the initial BER comes down quickly, and ensures the subsequent information reconciliation be easily performed; hence the total key generation rate is improved. Experimental results demonstrate that the pre-distillation method has excellent ability of reducing the initial BER, especially in the case of very high initial BER. The combination of our proposed pre-distillation and our optimal information reconciliation is the most efficient one when the initial BER is larger than 0.15, and the information rate is improved by more than forty-nine times when the initial BER is 0.3",

        "abstract": "In this paper we discuss implementation of the curricular reform on the subject of Computing at the primary school level. The reason for this is the fact that there is a trend of implementation of programming and algorithmization in education in more and more countries of the world. First, we analyse the form of the informatics curriculum in four selected countries - in the UK, Austria, Germany and Poland. Then we focus on examining the views of teachers on the form of the curriculum, i.e. what they think should be taught in schools, regardless of the prescribed curriculum. The q-methodology was used to carry out the research that allowed us, thanks to working with a smaller sample of respondents, to have a deeper insight into the researched area. The research activities show that there are two groups of teachers - \"opposers to programming\" and \"supporters of the thematically balanced development of informatics competencies and digital literacy\". The teachers involved in the first of these groups prefer to teach topics related to the general use of computers in everyday life. They put great emphasis on teaching topics such as network security, working with text and spreadsheet editors, creating presentations. However the least preferred topics, i.e. those that should not be taught in the schools according to these teachers, definitely include programming and algorithmization. The teachers in the second group prefer topics that can generally be included under the term \"digital literacy\", i.e. work with text and spreadsheet editors, network security, computer graphics, creating presentations, basic computer skills etc. as well as topics related to programming and algorithmization.\n\n",

        "abstract": "English vocabulary constitutes a challenge for English foreign language teaching and learning. Most students spend a lot of time studying English vocabulary, but the result is often frustrating and unsatisfactory when so many students learn vocabulary by rote memorization, which is boring and dampens students' enthusiasm for learning. Therefore, it is desirable to find an effective tool to help students learn English vocabulary. The Mind Map is a thinking tool that, based on divergent thinking, builds up a structure of knowledge for each target word by associating it with other related words or concepts. Thus, recalling of one vocabulary word will prompt the other related items. It also incorporates words, pictures, color, images and graphics, making learning information a vividly visual format. Using Mind Maps in learning is in conformity with the theory of knowledge of visualization, information processing theory and brain science theory.\n\nThis paper analyzes the feasibility of using the Mind Map in teaching and learning English vocabulary theoretically. Prior to any trials or other empirical research, this initial study adopts the qualitative methodology, mainly analyzing the features of the Mind Map and the scientific basis for using the Mind Map in teaching and learning English vocabulary. The goal of this paper is to encourage English foreign language teachers and students to incorporate the Mind Map into their educational process as an effective technique for teaching and learning English vocabulary.\n\n",

In this article, we will outline some current popular ICT tools and some future popular ones in education and focus on the impacts of ICT on education of English, aiming to enlighten educators to effectively capitalize on these ICT tools in education of English.  During the processing of this study, theoretical methods were used \u2013 mainly research takes and findings from papers included in Web of Science and SCOPUS databases. The findings were compared and analyzed in order to deduce new conclusions. Also, a method of induction was also applied.  It turns out that modern technology provide a wide range of ICT integration in teaching of English language. However, there are many obstacles which prevent its successful introduction into the teaching. In spite of the fact that ICT integration into education is beneficial, it is possible to come across various difficulties in the integration process, e.g. the lack of qualified language teachers who know how to use modern technology, or the education policy which supports the employment of ICT in the educational process.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may have potential applications in regenerative medicine for the treatment of chronic liver diseases (CLDs). Human menstrual blood is a novel source of MSCs, termed menstrual blood-derived stem cells (MenSCs). Compared with bone marrow MSCs, MenSCs exhibit a higher proliferation rate and they can be obtained through a simple, safe, painless procedure without ethical concerns. Although the therapeutic efficacy of MenSCs has been explored in some diseases, their effects on liver fibrosis are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of MenSC transplantation in a carbon tetrachloride-induced mouse model of liver fibrosis. These results revealed that MenSCs markedly improved liver function, attenuated collagen deposition, and inhibited activated hepatic stellate cells up to 2 weeks after transplantation. Moreover, tracking of green fluorescent protein-expressing MenSCs demonstrated that transplanted cells migrated to the sites of injury, but few differentiated into functional hepatocyte-like cells. Transwell coculturing experiments also showed that MenSCs suppressed proliferation of LX-2 cells (an immortalized hepatic stellate cell line) through secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-6, hepatocyte growth factor, growth-related oncogene, interleukin-8, and osteoprotegerin. Collectively, our results provided preliminary evidence for the antifibrotic capacity of MenSCs in liver fibrosis and suggested that these cells may be an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of CLDs.

Menstrual blood-derived stem cells (MenSCs) have been shown to be good therapeutic tools in diseases such as ovarian failure and cardiac fibrosis.

We hypothesized that MenSC could attenuate the inflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and promote the repair of damaged lung. ALI model was induced by LPS in C57 mice, and saline or MenSCs were administered via tail vein after four hours. The MenSCs were subsequently detected in the lungs by a live imaging system. The MenSCs not only improved pulmonary microvascular permeability and attenuated histopathological damage, but also mediated the downregulation of IL-1\u03b2 and the upregulation of IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the damaged lung. Immunohistochemistry revealed the increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the reduced expression of caspase-3 indicating the beneficial effect of MenSCs. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) was also upregulated after MenSCs administrated. As shown using transwell co-culture, the MenSCs also could improve the viability of BEAS-2B cells and inhibit LPS-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that MenSC-based therapies could be promising strategies for treating ALI.",

The characteristics of MSCs and their tumortropic capability make them an ideal tool for use in cell-based therapies for cancer, including glioma. These cells can function either through a bystander effect or as a delivery system for genes and drugs. MSCs have been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of glioma and to improve survival following transplantation into the brain. We briefly review the current data regarding the use of MSCs in the treatment of glioma and discuss the potential strategies for development of a more specific and effective therapy.",

In this paper, the preparation of CuO quantum dots (\u22482 nm) delicately embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as 2-CuO@C) with a thin film via a feasible electrospinning method is reported. The CuO content can be controlled by altering the synthetic conditions and is optimized to 54 wt%. As binder-free anode for sodium ion batteries, 2-CuO@C delivers an initial reversible capacity of 528 mA h g at the current density of 100 mA g , an exceptional rate capability of 250 mA h g at 5000 mA g , and an ultra-stable capacity of 401 mA h g after 500 cycles at 500 mA g . The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of 2-CuO@C, which offers a variety of advantages: highly conductive carbon matrix suppressing agglomeration of CuO grains, interconnected nanofibers ensuring short transport length for electrons, well-dispersed CuO quantum dots leading to highly utilization rate, and good mechanical properties resulting in strong electrode integrity.",

Herein, a controllable fabrication is reported for the self-supported structure of CuCo O nanodots (\u22483 nm) delicately inserted into N-doped carbon nanofibers (named as 3-CCO@C); this composite is first used as binder-free anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Benefiting from the synergetic effect of ultrasmall CuCo O nanoparticles and a tailored N-doped carbon matrix, the 3-CCO@C composite exhibits high cycling stability (capacity of 314 mA h g at 1000 mA g after 1000 cycles) and high rate capability (296 mA h g , even at 5000 mA g ). Significantly, the Na storage mechanism is systematically explored, demonstrating that the irreversible reaction of CuCo O , which decomposes to Cu and Co, happens in the first discharge process, and then a reversible reaction between metallic Cu/Co and CuO/Co O occurrs during the following cycles. This result is conducive to a mechanistic study of highly promising bimetallic-oxide anodes for rechargeable SIBs.",

Herein, the Co and CoP nanograins embedded in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (Co/CoP@NC) are prepared by a controllable electrospinning method and subsequent thermal treatments as the wide-pH HER electrocatalysts. Owning to the prominent merits of strong synergistic relationships between Co and CoP nanoparticles, N-doped carbon configuration, and the interconnected three dimensional (3D) porous carbon network, the Co/CoP@NC nanofibers exhibit robust HER activity with affording an overpotential of 117\u00a0mV in acidic and 180\u00a0mV in alkaline media to deliver the current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm -2 . As a practical application, when integrated the Co/CoP@NC/Ni foam cathode with the NiFe layered double hydroxides/Ni foam anode (NiFe-LDH/Ni foam), the electrolyzer can afford the cell voltage of 1.62\u00a0V to deliver the current density of 10\u00a0mA cm -2 , as well as ultralong lifetime of 60\u00a0h in alkaline medium, providing a viable alternative to the noble-metal electrocatalysts for water splitting.",

Empirical formulae for the calculation of the molar enthalpies of dissolution (\u0394diss H), relative partial molar enthalpies (\u0394diss H partial), and relative apparent molar enthalpies (\u0394diss H apparent) were deduced by the experimental results of the dissolution processes of (H2O)2BTO and [Na2(H2O)4]BTO in DMSO. Finally, the corresponding kinetic equations describing the dissolution processes were d\u03b1/dt = 10\u22122.60(1\u2212\u03b1)0.61 for the dissolution of (H2O)2BTO in DMSO, and d\u03b1/dt = 10\u22122.69(1\u2212\u03b1)0.62 for the dissolution of [Na2(H2O)4]BTO in DMSO.",

        "abstract": "Silicosis is the most serious occupational disease in China. The objective of this study was to screen various proteins related to mechanisms of the pathogenesis of silicosis underlying the anti-fibrotic effect of N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) using proteomic profile analysis. We also aimed to explore a potential mechanism of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin (\u03b1-Ac-Tub) regulation by Ac-SDKP. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) were used to assess the different protein expression profiles between control and silicosis rats treated with or without Ac-SDKP. Twenty-nine proteins were identified to be potentially involved in the progression of silicosis and the anti-fibrotic effect of Ac-SDKP. Our current study finds that 1) the lost expression of Ac-Tub-\u03b1 may be a new mechanism in rat silicosis; 2) treatment of silicotic rats with N-acetyl-Seryl-Aspartyl-Lysyl-Proline (Ac-SDKP) inhibits myofibroblast differentiation and collagen deposition accompanied by stabilizing the expression of \u03b1-Ac-Tub in vivo and in vitro, which is related with deacetylase family member 6 (HDAC6) and \u03b1-tubulin acetyl transferase (\u03b1-TAT1). Our data suggest that \u03b1-Ac-Tub regulation by Ac-SDKP may potentially be a new anti-fibrosis mechanism.",

In this work, a new real-time Electromyography-driven Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) cycling system was developed to help chronic stroke patients with lower limb rehabilitation training. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this system, 3 chronic stroke subjects were recruited and each received 20 training sessions where real-time Electromyography (EMG) was used to interact with the cycling system. During the training, two typical metrics, averaged Area Under Torque (AUT) and maximal EMG amplitude, were adopted to measure the muscle strength changes of hamstring (HS). The training results showed that the two measurements of HS both significantly increased, especially the maximal EMG amplitude in the last trial was twice as much as that in the first trial, indicating paretic limb strength increment and functional recovery, which suggested that our system is effective and helpful in the stroke rehabilitation.",

        "abstract": "The active participation of the stroke survivor during Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) cycling system is an interesting question that we would like to investigate, since active rehabilitation can promote a better motor function recovery than passive training. In this pilot study, a smart FES cycling system which can assess the participants cycling effort was proposed to record real-time Electromyography (EMG) and torque during lower limb training for chronic stroke survivors. The rehabilitation goals were to increase the lower-limb muscle strength and enhance the muscle coordination. Chronic stroke patients (n=6) with gait impairment and moderate motor disability were recruited to evaluate the functionality of the system. The system was composed of a modified station bike with an adjustable chair, a programmable functional electrical stimulator, a step motor, a torque sensor, and a surface electromyography (EMG) amplifier. Four-channel FES and EMG electrodes were placed at quadriceps (QC), hamstrings (HS), tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (GL) to exert stimulation. We adopted two measurements, clinical assessment scores and symmetric index (SI), to evaluate the training effects. The experimental results showed the proposed cycling system could improve the participants walking ability (p=.046) and enhance balance of the muscle coordination (p=.042) after training.",

        "abstract": "Abnormal proliferation and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle (VSMC), as the main structural component of the vasculature, is an important pathological mechanism of hypertension. Recently, increased levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and copeptin, the C-terminal fragment of provasopressin, have been shown to correlate with the development of preeclampsia. AVP targets on the G-coupled vasopressin V receptor and the G-coupled V receptor in VSMC and the kidneys to regulate vascular tone and water homeostasis. However, the role of the vasopressin receptor on VSM cell proliferation during vascular remodeling is unclear. Here, we studied the effects of AVP on the proliferation of the rat VSMC-derived A7r5 cells. AVP, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, promoted A7r5 cell proliferation as indicated by the induction of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium reduction and incorporation of 5'-bromodeoxyuridine into cellular DNA. These effects, coupled with the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK), were blocked by a V receptor antagonist SR45059 but not by a V receptor antagonist lixivaptan. Although acute activation of V receptor induced ERK phosphorylation via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway, this effect was not involved in cell proliferation. Cell proliferation and ERK phosphorylation in response to prolonged stimulation with AVP were abolished by inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using specific inhibitors or small hairpin RNA knock-down. These results suggest that activation of V, but not V receptor, produces a cell proliferative signal in A7r5 cells via a GRK2/EGFR/ERK-dependent mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin 6 (IL-6), which is elevated in patients with congestive heart failure and acts as both a chronic marker of inflammation and an acute-phase reactant, is associated with myocardial damage. Circulating levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) are elevated during cardiac stress and could be a factor for cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. Our previous study has shown that AVP promotes the proliferation of neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts (NRCFs) throughV vasopressin receptor-mediated G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) signaling. In the present study, we investigated the impact of the GRK2-dependent signaling. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we measured the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA and protein in NRCFs, respectively. Manipulation of GRK2 activation either pharmacologically or through overexpression of GRK2-ct was used to determine the role of GRK2 in regulating the effects of AVP on IL-6 production. Phosphorylation and activation of nuclear factor \u03ba-B (NF-B) evoked by AVP stimulation were measured by immunoblot and NF-kB luciferase reporter gene transfected in NRCFs, respectively. Present studies have found that: 1) AVP increased the level of IL-6 protein and mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner in NRCFs; 2) inhibition of GRK2 abolished the AVP-induced IL-6 production and NF-B activation; and 3) blocking NF-B signaling using the pharmacologic approach diminished AVP-induced IL-6 production. In summary, AVP induces IL-6 production of NRCFs by activating V receptor signaling via a GRK2/NF-B pathway. These findings provide a possible molecular mechanism for inflammation that occurs in heart failure and other types of cardiac stress.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a pathological feature commonly found in hearts exposed to haemodynamic orneurohormonal stress. Elevated levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) are closely associated with the progression of heart failure and could be an underlying cause of cardiac fibrosis. The aim of this study is to characterize the effect of AVP on neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts (NRCFs) and to illustrate its signalling mechanism. The proliferative effect of AVP was assessed by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium assay and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay, and the amounts of cellular signalling proteins \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, MMP9, and phosphorylated ERK were determined by western blotting. AVP, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, promoted NRCF proliferation and the expression of MMP2 and MMP9. Inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor kinase2 (GRK2) by the inhibitory peptide GRK2-Ct or knock-down of GRK2 suppressed AVP-induced BrdU incorporation and the expression of MMP2 and \u03b1-SMA in NRCFs. Moreover, shRNA-mediated silencing of \u03b2-arrestin1 or \u03b2-arrestin 2 abolished AVP-induced BrdU incorporation and MMP2 expression. AVP-induced NRCF proliferation depended on the phosphorylation of ERK , and inhibition of GRK2 or silencing of \u03b2-arrestins blocked AVP-induced ERK phosphorylation. The effects of AVP on NRCF proliferation and \u03b1-SMA expression were blocked by SR45059, a vasopressin receptor type1A (V R) selective antagonist. In conclusion, AVP promotes NRCF proliferation through V R-mediated GRK2/\u03b2-arrestin/ERK signalling.",

        "abstract": "As demand for biofuel feedstock production increases, the substitutable woody oilseed benzoin (Styrax tonkinensis (Pierre) Craib ex Hartwich) has received increased attention among Chinese researchers. However, the mechanism of seed oil regulation has not been revealed in this species. Maternal control of seed lipid content has been observed in many plant species. In this study, in planta treatments were applied to create different pericarp photosynthesis activation levels in benzoin. Compared with fruit shading treatment, superior photosynthetic physiological characteristics were found in the brassinosteroid hormone 24-epibrassinolide-treated pericarps during maturation (56\u2013112\u00a0days after flowering); specifically, these superior characteristics were reflected by higher average and peak values of the Chl a/b ratio, NADPH/NADP+ ratio, NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase activity, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity. Next, we found that the pericarp-encapsulated seed yield and oil content were closely connected to the maternal-specific photosynthetic events. The enhanced pericarp photosynthesis activity (treated with 10\u00a0\u03bcM brassinosteroid) was accompanied by higher fatty acid synthase activity and a faster lipid deposition rate, which was verified by transmission electron microscopy. These changes led to a final increase in the total fatty acid (FA) content of mature seeds of 19%, which could be largely accounted for by the elevated saturated FA (mostly long-chain FAs) percentage in benzoin oil. When benzoin fruits grew in low light (bagged in three layers of black non-woven fabrics), lipid synthesis capability was markedly impaired. The dynamics of cellular storage reserves were further analyzed, suggesting that the pericarp-seed carbohydrate translocation efficiency in fruits and the carbon partitioning among seed reserves were directly responsible for the seed oil diversification under the treatments. Taken together, our results highlighted the maternal control, via pericarp photosynthesis, over the regulation of the seed oil content in benzoin.",

Significant linear relations (p u003c 0.01) were only observed between endosperm ROAs and the contents of whole-kernel crude lipid and fatty acids. The endosperm OBD (1.18\u20132.43 \u03bcm) was larger than that of embryo OBD (0.38\u20130.77 \u03bcm). M-shaped dynamics of acetyl coenzyme carboxylase (ACC) and diglyceride acyltransferase (DGAT) activities resembled the dynamic of endosperm OBD, as two peaks were observed at 78 and 113 DAF; the big oil body (\u22651.8 \u03bcm) fraction in endosperm increased as kernel ACC and DGAT activities also increased, and vice-versa. Embryo OBD gradually increased, with the big oil body (\u22650.5 \u03bcm) proportion increasing and the small oil body (u003c0.5 \u03bcm) proportion decreasing in general. Our results collectively suggested the distinct lipid accumulation patterns in the two benzoin kernel tissues, and revealed that the endosperm may determine the whole kernel oil biosynthetic process.",

        "abstract": "3D graphene aerogels (GAs) have attracted huge attentions from researchers due to their great potentials in vast applications. The hydrothermal reaction combined with freeze-drying using GO (Graphene oxide) as a precursor has proven to be an effective method for obtaining a relatively well-structured pure GAs. However, the insufficient mechanical strength and low compressibility of the materials still limit their practical applications. Here, we report the microstructure-induced strong mechanical anisotropy of these monolithic GAs in transverse direction (TD) and longitudinal direction (LD), which has never been considered to be related to structural vulnerability. To overcome this anisotropy and enhance the structure, we hereby introduce our self-made poly (vinyl alcohol)-co-polyethylene (PVA-co-PE) nanofibers and low molecular weight PVA as structural enhancers into the original 3D network to form a novel nanofibers-graphene composite aerogel. Intriguingly, a unique configuration is formed in the GA, in which the highly aligned stacked rGO sheets serve as framework (cellular walls), and the nanofibers act as crosslinking columns anchored between the walls to support the structure along TD, while the micro/nanosized PVA lamellae as binders. The resulting aerogel (referred to as GNPA) has excellent compressive resilience along TD and exhibits ultra-high Gauge Factor (14387%) at a very subtle strain (0.23%) in piezoresistive properties. The GNPA-TD has also been assembled into a verity of wearable sensors and demonstrates the great potential for wireless human pressure sensing. In short, this study offers an extremely simple and effective method for developing graphene aerogels with a strong mechanical structure and paves the way for the application of 3D graphene in wearable sensors.",

A modulating thermal resistance  R   md  , correcting the heat flux, was introduced in the thermal resistance network to analyze two-dimensional square arrayed square fiber model of composite for its effective transverse thermal conductivity. The result of present method showed a better agreement with that of finite element method (FEM) than existed parallel or series thermal resistance network. Around this consideration, the composite reinforced by fiber with circular-cross section was also modeled to evaluate the transverse thermal conductivity, which still exhibit well consistent with experimental data. It indicates that the proposed method is enough accurate and effective for evaluating the thermal conductivity of unidirectional fiber composite and provides a facile approach to understand the complicated heat flow transfer behavior in composites.",

The upper layer of the filter was packed with activated carbon-loaded polyurethane, whereas the lower layer was filled with modified organism-suspended fillers. The effects of inlet load, empty bed residence time (EBRT) from 79\u00a0s to 53\u00a0s, pH and contaminant starvation time were investigated. For loads of 15\u201350\u00a0g/(m 3 \u00a0h), the average removal efficiency (RE) was higher than 96% under a consistent supply of pollutants. The critical elimination capacity was 39.95\u00a0g/(m 3 \u00a0h) for an EBRT of 53\u00a0s with an RE of 99.9%. The two-layer BTF was capable of withstanding contaminant starvation periods for 1.5\u00a0d and 7\u00a0d with only a few hours of recovery time. The biodegradation kinetics was studied using Michaelis\u2013Menten type equations under different EBRTs. At an EBRT of 66\u00a0s, the optimal kinetic constants  r  max  and  K  m  were 333.3\u00a0g/(m 3 \u00a0h) and 0.93\u00a0g/m 3 , respectively. During the operation, the two-layer BTF performed well under various reasonable conditions.",
