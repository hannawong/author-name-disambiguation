        "abstract": "Segmental small bowel transplantation offers theoretic advantages over total jejunoileal transplantation, but the regional ability of the transplanted segment to adapt is unknown. Absorption was measured in an 80 cm jejunal segment via a triple-lumen perfusion technique. Separate experiments measuring absorption of four nutrients (glucose, glutamine, oleic acid, and taurocholic acid) were performed before and 2 and 12 weeks after operative intervention. Control dogs (CON, n = 6) underwent distal 50% enterectomy. Experimental dogs (EXT DEN, n = 6), in addition to resection, underwent complete extrinsic denervation of the remaining jejunum. All dogs developed diarrhea, which rhesolved in all CON dogs but persisted in all EXT DEN dogs. Maximal weight loss was greater in the EXT DEN group. Glucose and oleate absorption was decreased 2 weeks after ileal resection in both the CON and EXT DEN dogs; glutamine absorption was decreased at 2 weeks in EXT DEN dogs only. Taurocholate and water absorption remained unchanged in both groups. Absorption of all solutes returned to baseline at 12 weeks in both groups. Despite greater weight loss and persistent diarrhea in EXT DEN dogs, at 12 weeks there were no differences in net absorptive fluxes between the EXT DEN and the CON group after extrinsic denervation. The extrinsic denervation necessitated by small bowel transplantation does not appear to blunt the net jejunal adaptive response to total ileal resection, but may temporarily alter glutamine absorption.

        "abstract": "Our previous studies suggested that extrinsic innervation modulates upper gut motility but is not requisite for cyclic interdigestive and postprandial motility of the stomach. However, the specific role of vagal and nonvagal extrinsic innervation in the initiation, coordination, and pattern of gastric motility in dogs after denervation of the entire upper gastrointestinal tract remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the role of vagal and nonvagal extrinsic innervation in control of gastric motility patterns. Mongrel dogs were subjected first to extrinsic denervation (in situ neural isolation) of the stomach, small bowel, proximal colon, liver, and pancreas but specifically maintaining vagal innervation to the stomach alone. After fasting and fed motility patterns were measured with indwelling gastric and small bowel manometry catheters, the dogs underwent transthoracic truncal vagotomy (completion of total extrinsic denervation of stomach), and motility studies were repeated. Vagal integrity to the stomach and pancreas was confirmed by means of a modified Hollander test and serum pancreatic polypeptide concentrations after the injection of exogenous insulin, respectively. We found that a cyclic motility pattern (migrating motor complex) persisted during fasting in both the stomach and the small bowel and that the patterns of the stomach and the duodenum remained temporally coordinated before and after vagotomy. However, although a cyclic phase III activity persisted in the stomach after vagotomy, the number of contractions and the motility index during phase III were decreased, and the duration between groupings of contractions was increased. No differences were noted in the duration of postprandial inhibition after feeding meals before and after vagotomy. These observations support our hypothesis that the vagal nerves are not necessary for the initiation or temporal coordination of global fasting or postprandial gastroduodenal motility patterns but are involved in modulating the pattern of contractions during gastric phase III.",

        "abstract": "Postprandial absorptive augmentation of water and electrolytes occurs in the small intestine and colon. The role of intraluminal nutrients in this response is poorly understood. Our aim was to determine whether postprandial absorptive augmentation of water and electrolytes in the colon requires the presence of intraluminal glucose. Four adult dogs underwent enteric isolation of a 50 cm segment of proximal colon. An ileal-like electrolyte solution (Na + , 130 mEq/L; K + , 10 mEq/L; Cl \u2212 , 115 mEq/L; and HCO 3 \u2212 , 25 mEq/L), alone or containing glucose (10 mmol/L), was infused at 4 ml/min into the colonic segment. Experiments were performed during fasting and postprandially after a 400 Kcal mixed-nutrient meal. Effluent was collected in 60-minute intervals after steady state was achieved. Net absorptive flux of water was increased in the presence of intraluminal glucose during the fasted state (11 \u00b1 0.8 vs 7.4 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcl/min/cm, P < 0.01). The net absorptive flux of water and electrolytes increased postprandially only in the presence of intraluminal glucose ( P < 0.05). Our finding that glucose augments both baseline and postprandial absorption of water and electrolytes in the proximal colon suggests that luminal factors have a role in postprandial absorptive augmentation. Whether this is specific to glucose or occurs with other nutrients remains to be determined. ( J Gastrointest Surg 2002;6:310-315.)",

Our aim was to determine whether extrinsic neural input modulates similar effects in the proximal colon in vivo. Methods. Ten adult dogs underwent enteric isolation of a 50-cm proximal colon loop; five each were randomized to undergo extrinsic denervation (Ext Den) of the isolated colonic segment or to serve as neurally innervated controls. After recovery, a 38\u00b0C electrolyte solution (Na + 125 meq/L, K + 9 meq/L, Cl \u2212 75 meq/L, HC0 \u2212 3 65 meq/L) was infused at 4 ml/min into the segment. Effluent was collected in 30-min intervals for 2 h after achieving steady state (determined by 14 C nonabsorbable marker recovery); four studies were conducted at 1 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Net flux of H 2 0, Na + , K + , and Cl \u2212 was determined. Colon morphometry was evaluated at 0 and 14 weeks. Data are presented as x\u0304 \u00b1 SEM. Unpaired t test was applied for comparisons. Results. Net absorptive flux of H 2 0 (\u03bcL/min/cm) was decreased in Ext Den vs controls at 1 week (4.40 \u00b1 0.63 vs 7.92 \u00b1 0.92, P = 0.03) but was not different at 12 weeks (4.70 \u00b1 1.20 vs 5.97 \u00b1 0.69; P > 0.05). Na + and Cl \u2212 followed the trends in H 2 0 absorption ( P \u2264 0.05). Crypt depth (\u03bcm) decreased in controls at 14 weeks vs 0 week (915 \u00b1 20 vs 740 \u00b1 07, P = 0.01) but remained unchanged in Ext Den. Conclusions. Loss of extrinsic neural input decreases colonic absorption. This observation suggests that extrinsic neural innervation provides net proabsorptive mechanisms for absorption of water and electrolytes in the proximal canine colon.",

        "abstract": "Early postoperative complications after small bowel transplantation (SBT) are likely mediated, at least in part, by dysmotility caused by the obligate disruption of extrinsic and enteric nerves in the graft. Adrenergic hypersensitivity of gut smooth muscle has been observed in some (but not all) segments of intestine in various experimental models of SBT, highlighting regional and species variability in response to denervation. Little is known about changes in canine longitudinal muscle after extrinsic denervation. Six dogs each underwent either complete extrinsic denervation of the jejunoileum or a control operation (transection and reanastomosis of the proximal jejunum and distal ileum). In vitro contractile response of longitudinal muscle strips to norepinephrine was evaluated at the time of the operation, and 2 weeks and 8 weeks later. After extrinsic denervation, the jejunal response to norepinephrine was preserved at all time points; however, the ileum displayed a decreased sensitivity to norepinephrine, an effect unmasked after intramural neural blockade with tetrodotoxin. These data support a potential for neurally mediated dysmotility after SBT and reinforce the differences in responses to extrinsic denervation between species, as well as differences within different regions and between anatomic segments of small intestine in the same species.

        "abstract": "Our aim was to determine if extrinsic denervation alters the absorptive response of the colon to proabsorptive and prosecretory stimuli. Ten dogs underwent enteric isolation of a 50-cm proximal colonic segment; five were also randomized to undergo extrinsic denervation (DEN). At 2 and 13 wk postoperatively, net absorptive fluxes (mean +/- SEM) of water and electrolytes were determined during basal conditions and during proabsorptive low-dose (0.3 microg/kg/min) or high-dose (3 microg/kg/min) norepinephrine or prosecretory VIP (500 pg/kg/min). The net absorptive flux of water under basal conditions was decreased in DEN versus neurally intact controls at two weeks (4.0 +/- 0.6 vs 6.6 +/- 0.7 microl/min/cm, P = 0.03) but did not differ at 13 weeks (5.0 +/- 1.0 vs 5.7 +/- 0.9, P > 0.05). Low- and high-dose norepinephrine increased water absorption in both groups at two weeks; the change in flux for high-dose norepinephrine was greater in DEN versus controls (4.1 +/- 1 vs 2.1 +/- 0.6 microl/min/cm, P = 0.04). Net absorptive fluxes of Na+ and Cl- followed these trends. VIP did not alter absorption of water or electrolytes. Extrinsic denervation of the proximal colon causes a decrease in net colonic absorption and a transient, proabsorptive adrenergic hypersensitivity in colonic absorption of water and electrolytes. VIP does not have a net secretory effect in the proximal canine colon.",

        "abstract": "Segmental small bowel transplantation offers theoretic advantages over total jejunoileal transplantation, but the regional\n ability of the transplanted segment to adapt is unknown. Absorption was measured in an 80 cm jejunal segment via a triple-lumen\n perfusion technique. Separate experiments measuring absorption of four nutrients (glucose, glutamine, oleic acid, and taurocholic\n acid) were performed before and 2 and 12 weeks after operative intervention. Control dogs (CON, n = 6) underwent distal 50%\n enterectomy. Experimental dogs (EXT DEN, n = 6), in addition to resection, underwent complete extrinsic denervation of the\n remaining jejunum. All dogs developed diarrhea, which rhesolved in all CON dogs but persisted in all EXT DEN dogs. Maximal\n weight loss was greater in the EXT DEN group. Glucose and oleate absorption was decreased 2 weeks after ileal resection in\n both the CON and EXT DEN dogs; glutamine absorption was decreased at 2 weeks in EXT DEN dogs only. Taurocholate and water\n absorption remained unchanged in both groups. Absorption of all solutes returned to baseline at 12 weeks in both groups. Despite\n greater weight loss and persistent diarrhea in EXT DEN dogs, at 12 weeks there were no differences in net absorptive fluxes\n between the EXT DEN and the CON group after extrinsic denervation. The extrinsic denervation necessitated by small bowel transplantation\n does not appear to blunt the net jejunal adaptive response to total ileal resection, but may temporarily alter glutamine absorption.",

The analysis is based on infor- mation geometry, and it shows that the principal term of decoding error at equilibrium comes from the m-embedding curvature of the log-linear submanifold spanned by the estimated pseudoposteriors, one for the full marginal, and K for partial posteriors, each of which takes a single check into account, where K is the number of checks in the Gallager code. It is then shown that the principal error term vanishes when the parity-check matrix of the code is so sparse that there are no two columns with overlap greater than 1.",

Its performance has been analyzed separately in many fields, such as AI, statistical physics, information theory, and information geometry. This article gives a unified framework for understanding BP and related methods and summarizes the results obtained in many fields. In particular, BP and its variants, including tree reparameterization and concave-convex procedure, are reformulated with information-geometrical terms, and their relations to the free energy function are elucidated from an information-geometrical viewpoint. We then propose a family of new algorithms. The stabilities of the algorithms are analyzed, and methods to accelerate them are investigated.",

Characteristics of the iterative decoding algorithm have been studied in detail through a variety of numerical experiments, but theoretical results are still insufficient. In this paper, this issue is addressed from the information geometrical viewpoint. As a result, a mathematical framework for analyzing turbo codes is obtained, and some of the fundamental properties of turbo decoding are elucidated based on this framework. Recently, it has been pointed out that the turbo decoding algorithm is related to the decoding algorithm of low-density parity check codes, the computation method of Bethe approximation in statistical physics, and the belief propagation algorithm of Bayesian networks. The mathematical framework given in the present paper can also be used to analyze these wide classes of iterative computation methods, and hence represent a new analysis tool. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An approximate implementa- tion of demodulators is proposed using analog-valued Hopfield model as a naive mean-field approximation to the MPM demodulators, and its performance is also evaluated by the replica analysis.

        "abstract": "One of the most important and interesting aspects of the neural networks is that they exhibit collective information-processing capabilities by connecting processing elements (\"neurons\"), each of which per- forms a very simple and limited information processing. The central issue of the neural network research is thus to explore how and why such a system with simple elements exhibits complex information pro- cessing functionalities. Being looked at from another direction, by studying the problem, we are asking about the global characterization of the information processing performed by the network, on the basis of the local characterization of information processing (i.e., that performed by each neuron), as well as how they are interconnected. Essentially the same problem also arises in the study of graphical models (Bayesian networks). The main objective of this section is to give a brief review of the graphical models, with some emphasis on their relation to neural networks. In one important class of graphical models, a system with an N -dimensional random vector x is characterized by a set of local conditional probabilities of the form: p(xi|x\\i), where x\\i denotes the set of all the elements of x except xi. If, for all i, xi is independent of xj, j>i , then the set of the local conditional probabilities defines a global probability distribution",

Iterative multiuser detection and decoding based on generalized posterior mean estimation and interference cancellation is assumed. The channel is mismatched and provided by a linear estimator whose initial pilot-based decisions are iteratively refined by using a feedback from the single-user decoders. By an application of the replica method, a tool from statistical physics, and density evolution with Gaussian approximation, we show that the performance metrics of the considered multiuser system converge in distribution at the large system limit to that of a simple single-user system operating over a flat fading channel. We also give the exact result of the hard decision feedback based channel estimator analyzed approximately by Li et al. (2007).",

        "abstract": "Training-based transmission over Rayleigh block-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels is investigated. As a training method a combination of a pilot-assisted scheme and a biased signaling scheme is considered. The achievable rates of successive decoding (SD) receivers based on the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation are analyzed in the large-system limit, by using the replica method under the assumption of replica symmetry. It is shown that negligible pilot information is best in terms of the achievable rates of the SD receivers in the large-system limit. The obtained analytical formulas of the achievable rates can improve the existing lower bound on the capacity of the MIMO channel with no channel state information (CSI), derived by Hassibi and Hochwald, for all SNRs. The comparison between the obtained bound and a high-SNR approximation of the channel capacity, derived by Zheng and Tse, implies that the high-SNR approximation is unreliable unless quite high SNR is considered. Energy efficiency in the low-SNR regime is also investigated in terms of the power per information bit required for reliable communication. The required minimum power is shown to be achieved at a positive rate for the SD receiver with no CSI, whereas it is achieved in the zero-rate limit for the case of perfect CSI available at the receiver. Moreover, numerical simulations imply that the presented large-system analysis can provide a good approximation for not so large systems. The results in this paper imply that SD schemes can provide a significant performance gain in the low-to-moderate SNR regimes, compared to conventional receivers based on one-shot channel estimation.",

We evaluate their performance,in terms of asymptotic spectral efficiency, which is obtained via decoupling structure, by using the replica method. Numerical results imply,that the performance,of LMMSE detection is very close to that of MMSE detection for small system loads. Furthermore, we find that the spectral efficiency of MMSE detection grows discontinuously with the length of pilot sequences for large system loads, and that the critical length is close to the optimal,length. While it is indistinguishable from,that of LMMSE detection for short pilot sequences, the gap between the two is significantly large if the length of pilot sequences,is longer than the critical length.",

In this paper, spatial coupling is applied to sparsely spread code-division multiple-access systems to improve the performance of iterative multiuser detection based on BP. Two iterative receivers based on BP are considered: 1) one receiver is based on exact BP and 2) the other on an approximate BP with Gaussian approximation. The performance of the two BP receivers is evaluated via density evolution (DE) in the dense limit after taking the large-system limit, in which the number of users and the spreading factor tend to infinity while their ratio is kept constant. The two BP receivers are shown to achieve the same performance as each other in these limits. Furthermore, taking a continuum limit for the obtained DE equations implies that the performance of the two BP receivers can be improved up to the performance achieved by the symbol-wise MAP detection, called individually optimal detection, via spatial coupling. Numerical simulations show that spatial coupling can provide a significant improvement in bit-error rate for finite-sized systems especially in the region of high system loads.",

The history of random matrices can be traced back to multivariate statistics and mathematical physics in early-mid 20th-century, and a significant amount of knowledge has been accumulated since then. In recent years several new applications of random matrices in the field of informatics have emerged. They include statistical learning, data science, mathematical finance (1), and wireless communication (2), to mention a few. In these research fields, matrices of the sample-covariance form A =\u039e T \u039e, where \u039e is a rectan- gular random matrix, play important roles, so that understanding properties of eigenvalue distributions of such matrices is useful. Although the eigenvalue distribution of a random matrix is itself a random quantity, in many canonical cases it becomes deterministic in the limit of infinite dimensionality. This property, called the self-averaging property, allows us to analytically treat limiting eigenvalue distributions in the infinite-dimensionality limit.",

We analyze, via the replica method, the average mutual information between inputs and outputs of a randomly spread CDMA channel, and discuss the optimization problem with the average mutual information as the measure of optimization. It has been shown that the average mutual information is maximized by orthogonally-invariant random Welch bound equality (WBE) spreading sequences.

The receiver uses iterative channel estimation and multiuser detection (MUD) with soft feedback from single-user decoders to refine both the decisions of the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) MUD, and the initial pilot-based estimates of the LMMSE channel estimator. Replica method, a tool from statistical physics, and density evolution with Gaussian approxima- tion are used to obtain the asymptotic performance of the LMMSE MUD with soft parallel interference cancellation. The results indi- cate that as the channel coherence time grows, the performance of corresponding single-user system having perfect channel state in- formation can be approached even in an overloaded multiuser sys- tem using channel estimation and vanishing pilot overhead.",

Channel knowledge is obtained by a linear estimator whose initial decisions are iteratively refined by using a soft feedback from the single-user decoders. In addition to the traditional training symbol based signaling scheme, we study a novel method that utilizes a random bias in the symbol probabilities of the transmitted signal to construct the initial channel estimates. The numerical results suggest that in the large system limit, appropriate selection of the channel code and signaling method allows for successful communication with vanishing training overhead in overloaded systems if iterative channel and data estimation is performed at the receiver.",

On the basis of this result, we characterize the asymptotic behavior, as well as its dependence on the rate, of the block error probability of polar codes using the successive cancellation decoder. This refines the original asymptotic bounds by Ar\u0131kan and Telatar. Our results apply to general polar codes based on $\\\\ell\\\\times\\\\ell$ kernel matrices. We also provide asymptotic lower bounds on the block error probability of polar codes using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder.

Recently, non-binary polar codes have been investigated. In this paper, we calculate error probability of non-binary polar codes constructed on the basis of Reed-Solomon matrices by numerical simulations. It is confirmed that 4-ary polar codes have significantly better performance than binary polar codes on binary-input AWGN channel. We also discuss an interpretation of polar codes in terms of algebraic geometry codes, and further show that polar codes using Hermitian codes have asymptotically good performance.",

        "abstract": "Recoverin, a new member of the EF-hand superfamily, serves as a Ca2+ sensor in vision. A myristoyl or related N-acyl group is covalently attached at its N-terminus and plays an essential role in Ca(2+)-dependent membrane targeting by a novel calcium-myristoyl switch mechanism. The structure of unmyristoylated recoverin containing a single bound Ca2+ has recently been solved by X-ray crystallography [Flaherty, K. M., Zozulya, S., Stryer, L., & McKay, D. B. (1993) Cell 75, 709-716]. We report here multidimensional heteronuclear NMR studies on Ca(2+)-free, myristoylated recoverin (201 residues, 23 kDa). Complete polypeptide backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary structure are presented. We find 11 helical segments and two pairs of antiparallel beta-sheets, in accord with the four EF-hands seen in the crystal structure. The present NMR study also reveals some distinct structural features of the Ca(2+)-free myristoylated protein. The N-terminal helix of EF-2 is flexible in the myristoylated Ca(2+)-free protein, whereas it has a well-defined structure in the unmyristoylated Ca(2+)-bound form. This difference suggests that the binding of Ca2+ to EF-3 induces EF-2 to adopt a conformation favorable for the binding of a second Ca2+ to recoverin. Furthermore, the N-terminal helix (K5-E16) of myristoylated Ca(2+)-free recoverin is significantly longer than that seen in the unmyristoylated Ca(2+)-bound protein. We propose that this helix is stabilized by the attached myristoyl group and may play a role in sequestering the myristoyl group within the protein in the Ca(2+)-free state.",

        "abstract": "The solution structure of calcium-bound calmodulin (CaM) complexed with an antagonist, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7), has been determined by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The structure consists of one molecule of W-7 binding to each of the two domains of CaM. In each domain, the W-7 chloronaphthalene ring interacts with four methionine methyl groups and other aliphatic or aromatic side-chains in a deep hydrophobic pocket, the site responsible for CaM binding to CaM-dependent enzymes such as myosin light chain kinases (MLCKs) and CaM kinase II. This competitive binding at the same site between W-7 and CaM-dependent enzymes suggests the mechanism by which W-7 inhibits CaM to activate the enzymes. The orientation of the W-7 naphthalene ring in the N-terminal pocket is rotated approximately 40 degrees with respect to that in the C-terminal pocket. The W-7 ring orientation differs significantly from the Trp800 indole ring of smooth muscle MLCK bound to the C-terminal pocket and the phenothiazine ring of trifluoperazine bound to the N or C-terminal pocket. These comparative structural analyses demonstrate that the two hydrophobic pockets of CaM can accommodate a variety of bulky aromatic rings, which provides a plausible structural basis for the diversity in CaM-mediated molecular recognition.",

The Ca(2+)-bound form of recoverin prolongs the photoresponse, probably by blocking phosphorylation of photoexcited rhodopsin. Retinal recoverin contains a covalently attached myristoyl group or related acyl group at its amino terminus and two Ca(2+)-binding sites. Ca2+ binding to myristoylated, but not unmyristoylated, recoverin induces its translocation to bilayer membranes, indicating that the myristoyl group is essential to the read-out of calcium signals (calcium-myristoyl switch). Here we present the solution structure of Ca(2+)-free, myristoylated recombinant recoverin obtained by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The myristoyl group is sequestered in a deep hydrophobic pocket formed by many aromatic and other hydrophobic residues from five flanking helices.",

        "abstract": "The solution structure of Ca(2+)-free calmodulin has been determined by NMR spectroscopy, and is compared to the previously reported structure of the Ca(2+)-saturated form. The removal of Ca2+ causes the interhelical angles of four EF-hand motifs to increase by 36 degrees-44 degrees. This leads to major changes in surface properties, including the closure of the deep hydrophobic cavity essential for target protein recognition. Concerted movements of helices A and D with respect to B and C, and of helices E and H with respect to F and G are likely responsible for the cooperative Ca(2+)-binding property observed between two adjacent EF-hand sites in the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains.",

        "abstract": "The expression of the phase 2 detoxification enzymes and antioxidant proteins is induced at the transcrip- tional level by Nrf2 and negatively regulated at the posttranslational level by Keap1 through protein-protein interactions with and subsequent proteolysis of Nrf2. We found that the Neh2 domain of Nrf2 is an intrinsically disordered but biologically active regulatory domain containing a 33-residue central -helix followed by a mini antiparallel -sheet. Isothermal calorimetry analysis indicated that one Neh2 molecule interacts with two molecules of Keap1 via two binding sites, the stronger binding ETGE motif and the weaker binding DLG motif. Nuclear magnetic resonance titration study showed that these two motifs of the Neh2 domain bind to an overlapping site on the bottom surface of the -propeller structure of Keap1. In contrast, the central -helix of the Neh2 domain does not have any observable affinity to Keap1, suggesting that this region may serve as a bridge connecting the two motifs for the association with the two -propeller structures of a dimer of Keap1. Based on these observations, we propose that Keap1 recruits Nrf2 by the ETGE motif and that the DLG motif of the Neh2 domain locks its lysine-rich central -helix in a correct position to benefit ubiquitin signaling. Bodies are inevitably and constantly insulted by different environmental stresses caused by toxic chemicals, free radicals, carcinogens, and xenobiotic metabolites, which can induce the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer, diabetes, ath- erosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and arthritis (3, 29, 51, 53). The expression of an array of antioxidant and phase 2 drug- metabolizing enzymes protects cells from various oxidative stresses (2, 5, 12, 16, 17, 43, 44). The induction of these cyto- protective genes is regulated at the transcriptional level by a specific cis-acting element, the antioxidant/electrophile re- sponse element (ARE/EpRE) found in the promoter regions of these genes (21, 39, 40). Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2-related factor 2) has been found to be the central transcription factor that interacts with the ARE/EpRE to transactivate cytoprotec- tive gene expression constitutively or to induce the expression in response to oxidative stress signals (19, 21, 42).",

        "abstract": "Many eukaryotic cellular and viral proteins have a covalently attached myristoyl group at the amino terminus. One such protein is recoverin, a calcium sensor in retinal rod cells, which controls the lifetime of photoexcited rhodopsin by inhibiting rhodopsin kinase1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Recoverin has a relative molecular mass of 23,000 (Mr 23K), and contains an amino-terminal myristoyl group (or related acyl group) and four EF hands7. The binding of two Ca2+ ions to recoverin leads to its translocation from the cytosol to the disc membrane8,9. In the Ca2+-free state, the myristoyl group is sequestered in a deep hydrophobic box, where it is clamped by multiple residues contributed by three of the EF hands10. We have used nuclear magnetic resonance to show that Ca2+ induces the unclamping and extrusion of the myristoyl group, enabling it to interact with a lipid bilayer membrane. The transition is also accompanied by a 45-degree rotation of the amino-terminal domain relative to the carboxy-terminal domain, and many hydrophobic residues are exposed. The conservation of the myristoyl binding site and two swivels in recoverin homologues from yeast to humans indicates that calcium\u2013myristoyl switches are ancient devices for controlling calcium-sensitive processes.",

        "abstract": "The three-dimensional solution structure of recombinant bovine myristoylated recoverin in the Ca(2+)-free state has been refined using an array of isotope-assisted multidimensional heteronuclear NMR techniques. In some experiments, the myristoyl group covalently attached to the protein N-terminus was labeled with C and the protein was unlabeled or vice versa; in others, both were C-labeled. This differential labeling strategy was essential for structural refinement and can be applied to other acylated proteins. Stereospecific assignments of 41 pairs of beta-methylene protons and 48 methyl groups of valine and leucine were included in the structure refinement. The refined structure was constructed using a total of 3679 experimental NMR restraints, comprising 3242 approximate interproton distance restraints (including 153 between the myristoyl group and the polypeptide), 140 distance restraints for 70 backbone hydrogen bonds, and 297 torsion angle restraints. The atomic rms deviations about the average minimized coordinate positions for the secondary structure region of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are 0.44 +/- 0.07 and 0.55 +/- 0.18 A for backbone atoms, and the 1.09 +/- 0.07 and 1.10 +/- 0.15 A for all heavy atoms, respectively. The refined structure allows for a detailed analysis of the myristoyl binding pocket. The myristoyl group is in a slightly bent conformation: the average distance between C1 and C14 atoms of the myristoyl group is 14.6 A. Hydrophobic residues Leu28, Trp31, and Tyr32 from a cluster that interacts with the front end of the myristoyl (C1-C8), whereas residues Phe49, Phe56, Tyr86, Val87, and Leu90 interact with the tail end (C9-C14). The relatively deep hydrophobic pocket that binds the myristoyl group (C14:0) could also accommodate other naturally occurring acyl groups such as C12:0, C14:1, C14:2 chains.",

        "abstract": "The solution structure of calcium-bound calmodulin (CaM) complexed with an antagonist, N -(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7), has been determined by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The structure consists of one molecule of W-7 binding to each of the two domains of CaM. In each domain, the W-7 chloronaphthalene ring interacts with four methionine methyl groups and other aliphatic or aromatic side-chains in a deep hydrophobic pocket, the site responsible for CaM binding to CaM-dependent enzymes such as myosin light chain kinases (MLCKs) and CaM kinase II. This competitive binding at the same site between W-7 and CaM-dependent enzymes suggests the mechanism by which W-7 inhibits CaM to activate the enzymes. The orientation of the W-7 naphthalene ring in the N-terminal pocket is rotated approximately 40 degrees with respect to that in the C-terminal pocket. The W-7 ring orientation differs significantly from the Trp800 indole ring of smooth muscle MLCK bound to the C-terminal pocket and the phenothiazine ring of trifluoperazine bound to the N or C-terminal pocket. These comparative structural analyses demonstrate that the two hydrophobic pockets of CaM can accommodate a variety of bulky aromatic rings, which provides a plausible structural basis for the diversity in CaM-mediated molecular recognition.",

For example, HBx interacts with anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, through its BH3-like motif, which leads to elevated cytosolic calcium levels, efficient viral DNA replication and the induction of apoptosis. To facilitate sample preparation and perform detailed structural characterization of the complex between HBx and Bcl-x, we designed and purified a recombinant HBx BH3-like motif-linker-Bcl-x fusion protein produced in . The fusion protein was characterized by size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Our results show that the fusion protein is a monomer in aqueous solution, forms a stable intramolecular complex, and likely retains the native conformation of the complex between Bcl-x and the HBx BH3-like motif. Furthermore, the HBx BH3-like motif of the intramolecular complex forms an \u03b1-helix. These observations indicate that the fusion protein should facilitate structural studies aimed at understanding the interaction between HBx and Bcl-x at the atomic level.",

Here, we analyzed the interaction between HTLV-1 SU and Nrp1 using nuclear magnetic resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry. We found that two SU peptides, residues 85-94 and residues 304-312, bound directly to the Nrp1 b1 domain with affinities of 7.4 and 17.7\u202f\u03bcM, respectively. The binding modes of both peptides were almost identical to those observed for Tuftsin and vascular endothelial growth factor A binding to the Nrp1 b1 domain. These results suggest that the C-terminal region of HTLV-1 SU contains a novel site for direct binding of virus to the Nrp1 b1 domain. Our biophysical characterization of the SU peptides may help in developing inhibitors of HTLV-1 entry.",

To investigate the structure and function of this domain, the C-terminal domain of the rice ( Oryza sativa  L.) \u03b2-galactosidase 1 (OsBGal1 Cter) was expressed in  Escherichia coli  and purified to homogeneity. The free OsBGal1 Cter is monomeric with a native molecular weight of 15\u00a0kDa. NMR spectroscopy indicated that OsBGal1 Cter comprises five \u03b2-strands and one \u03b1-helix. The structure of this domain is similar to lectin domains from animals, but loops A and C of OsBGal1 Cter are longer than the corresponding loops from related animal lectins with known structures. In addition, loop A of OsBGal1 Cter was not well defined, suggesting it is flexible. Although OsBGal1 Cter was predicted to be a galactose/rhamnose-binding domain, binding with rhamnose, galactose, glucose, \u03b2-1,4- d -galactobiose and raffinose could not be observed in NMR experiments.",

        "abstract": "Certain lymphoid chemokines are selectively and constitutively expressed in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, where they play critical roles in the directional migration of extravasating lymphocytes into the lymphoid tissue parenchyma. How these chemokines are selectively localized and act in situ, however, remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the possibility that basal lamina-associated extracellular matrix proteins in the HEVs are responsible for retaining the lymphoid chemokines locally. Here we show that collagen IV (Col IV) bound certain lymphoid chemokines, including CCL21, CXCL13, and CXCL12, more potently than did fibronectin or laminin-1, but it bound CCL19 and CCL5 only weakly, if at all. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that Col IV bound CCL21 with a low nanomolar K(D), which required the C-terminal region of CCL21. Col IV can apparently hold these chemokines in their active form upon binding, because the Col IV-bound chemokines induced lymphocyte migration efficiently in vitro. We found by immunohistochemistry that Col IV and CCL21, CXCL13, and CXCL12 were colocalized in the basal lamina of HEVs. When injected s.c. into plt/plt mice, CCL21 colocalized at least partially with Col IV on the basal lamina of HEVs in draining lymph nodes. Collectively, our results suggest that Col IV contributes to the creation of a lymphoid chemokine-rich environment in the basal lamina of HEVs by binding an array of locally produced lymphoid chemokines that promote directional lymphocyte trafficking from HEVs into the lymphoid tissue parenchyma.",

        "abstract": "\u03b14\u03b27 integrin mediates lymphocyte trafficking to mucosal lymphoid organs by interacting with the mucosal vascular addressin MAdCAM-1. While the structural basis for the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin\u2013MAdCAM-1 interaction has been well characterized, less is known about the signal transduction pathways that regulate the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin-mediated lymphocyte interaction with MAdCAM-1-expressing endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that ligation of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin with MAdCAM-1 induces a prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and a 105-kDa protein (p105) that is reactive with an anti-p130 Cas antibody, in the mouse T-cell line TK-1. Cloning and expression of a full-length cDNA encoding the mouse p105 Cas-L revealed that the p105 molecule is a mouse ortholog of p105 Cas-L . We also demonstrated that crosslinking of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin with MAdCAM-1 induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and p105 Cas-L in normal lymphocytes and that PMA stimulation enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of p105 Cas-L but not of paxillin. These results suggest that intracellular signals initiated by \u03b14\u03b27 integrin involve the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and p105 Cas-L , which are differentially regulated, at least in part, by mechanisms that are PMA-sensitive or -insensitive.",

        "abstract": "Chemokines displayed on the luminal surface of blood vessels play pivotal roles in inflammatory and homeostatic leukocyte trafficking in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying the functional regulation of chemokines on the endothelial cell surface remain ill-defined. A promiscuous chemokine receptor, the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), has been implicated in the regulation of chemokine functions. Here we show that DARC is selectively expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of unstimulated lymph nodes (LN). To examine the biological significance of DARC expression in HEV, we performed competitive binding experiments with 20 different chemokines. The results showed that DARC selectively bound distinct members of the pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7, but not lymphoid chemokines such as CCL21, CCL19, CXCL12 and CXCL13 that are normally expressed in HEV. CCL2 bound to DARC failed to induce a significant cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation in CCR2B-expressing cells, whereas the free form of CCL2 induced a distinct [Ca(2+)] elevation, suggesting that DARC down-regulates activities of pro-inflammatory chemokines upon binding. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding DARC did not induce any obvious changes in the cell number or leukocyte subsets in the peripheral and mesenteric LN. Neither did DARC deficiency significantly affect lymphocyte migration into LN. These results suggest that DARC may be a scavenger for pro-inflammatory chemokines, but not a presenting molecule for lymphoid chemokines at HEV and that it is probably functionally dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking to HEV-bearing lymphoid tissues under physiological conditions.",

Here we show that DCs produce thromboxane A2 (TXA2), whereas naive T cells express the thromboxane receptor (TP). In vitro, a TP agonist enhances random cell movement (chemokinesis) of naive but not memory T cells, impairs DC-T cell adhesion, and inhibits DC-dependent proliferation of T cells. In vivo, immune responses to foreign antigens are enhanced in TP-deficient mice, which also develop marked lymphadenopathy with age. Similar immune responses were seen in wild-type mice treated with a TP antagonist during the sensitization period. Thus, TXA2-TP signaling modulates acquired immunity by negatively regulating DC-T cell interactions.",

        "abstract": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are natural type I IFN-producing cells found in lymphoid tissues, where they support both innate and adaptive immune responses. They emigrate from the blood to lymph nodes, apparently through high endothelial venules (HEVs), but little is known about the mechanism. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms of pDC migration using freshly isolated DCs and HEV cells. We found that pDCs bound avidly to HEV cells and then transmigrated underneath them. Two observations suggested that these binding and migration steps are differentially regulated. First, treatment of pDCs with pertussis toxin blocked transmigration but not binding. Second, pDCs were able to bind but not to transmigrate under non-HEV endothelial cells, although the binding was observed to both HEV and non-HEV endothelial cells. Antibody inhibition studies indicated that the binding process was mediated by alphaL and alpha4 integrins on pDCs and by intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, ICAM-2 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on HEVs. The transmigration process was also mediated by alphaL and alpha4 integrins on pDCs, with junctional adhesion molecule-A on HEV cells apparently serving as an additional ligand for alphaL integrin. These data show for the first time that pDCs employ multiple adhesion molecules sequentially in the processes of adhesion to and transmigration through HEVs.",

        "abstract": "Lymphocyte trafficking to lymph nodes (LNs) is initiated by the interaction between lymphocyte L-selectin and certain sialomucins, collectively termed peripheral node addressin (PNAd), carrying specific carbohydrates expressed by LN high endothelial venules (HEVs). Here, we identified a novel HEV-associated sialomucin, nepmucin (mucin not expressed in Peyer's patches [PPs]), that is expressed in LN HEVs but not detectable in PP HEVs at the protein level. Unlike conventional sialomucins, nepmucin contains a single V-type immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and a mucin-like domain. Using materials affinity-purified from LN lysates with soluble L-selectin, we found that two higher molecular weight species of nepmucin (75 and 95 kD) were decorated with oligosaccharides that bind L-selectin as well as an HEV-specific MECA-79 monoclonal antibody. Electron microscopic analysis showed that nepmucin accumulates in the extended luminal microvillus processes of LN HEVs. Upon appropriate glycosylation, nepmucin supported lymphocyte rolling via its mucin-like domain under physiological flow conditions. Furthermore, unlike most other sialomucins, nepmucin bound lymphocytes via its Ig domain, apparently independently of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 and very late antigen 4, and promoted shear-resistant lymphocyte binding in combination with intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Collectively, these results suggest that nepmucin may serve as a dual-functioning PNAd in LN HEVs, mediating both lymphocyte rolling and binding via different functional domains.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbial components and trigger the signaling cascade that activates the innate and adaptive immunity. TLR adaptor molecules play a central role in this cascade; thus, we hypothesized that overexpression of TLR adaptor molecules could mimic infection without any microbial components. Dual-promoter plasmids that carry an antigen and a TLR adaptor molecule such as the Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing beta interferon (TRIF) or myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) were constructed and administered to mice to determine if these molecules can act as an adjuvant. A DNA vaccine incorporated with the MyD88 genetic adjuvant enhanced antigen-specific humoral immune responses, whereas that with the TRIF genetic adjuvant enhanced cellular immune responses. Incorporating the TRIF genetic adjuvant in a DNA vaccine targeting the influenza HA antigen or the tumor-associated antigen E7 conferred superior protection. These results indicate that TLR adaptor molecules can bridge innate and adaptive immunity and potentiate the effects of DNA vaccines against virus infection and tumors.",

        "abstract": "Lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes is regulated by transient but specific interactions between lymphocytes and high endothelial venules (HEVs), the initial phase of which is mainly governed by the leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin, which recognizes sulfated and sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides displayed on sialomucin core proteins. One of the sialomucin proteins, endomucin, is predominantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells of a variety of tissues including the HEVs of lymph nodes; however, whether it functions as a ligand for L-selectin remains to be formally proven. Here we show that the endomucin splice isoform a is predominantly expressed in PNAd+ HEVs and MAdCAM-1+ HEVs, as seen in non-HEV-type vascular endothelial cells. Using affinity purification with soluble L-selectin, we found that HEV endomucin is specifically modified with L-selectin-reactive oligosaccharides and can bind L-selectin as well as an HEV-specific mAb, MECA-79. Our results also indicated that a 90-100 kDa endomucin species is preferentially decorated with L-selectin-reactive sugar chains, whereas an 80 kDa species represents conventional forms expressed in non-HEV-type vascular endothelial cells in lymph nodes. Furthermore, a CHO cell line expressing endomucin together with a specific combination of carbohydrate-modifying enzymes [core-2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT), alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase VII (FucTVII) and L-selectin ligand sulfotransferase (LSST)] showed L-selectin-dependent rolling under flow conditions in vitro. These results suggest that when endomucin is appropriately modified by a specific set of glycosyltransferases and a sulfotransferase, it can function as a ligand for L-selectin, and that the endomucin expressed in HEVs may represent another sialomucin ligand for L-selectin.",

        "abstract": "The homeostasis of the immune system is maintained by the recirculation of na\u00efve lymphocytes through the secondary lymphoid tissues, such as the lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and spleen. Upon insult by pathogens or antigens, lymphocytes become activated, and the regulated trafficking of these cells results in the integration of systemic and regional immune responses. The exquisite specificity of such lymphocyte trafficking is determined by tissue-specific guidance signals expressed by the endothelial cells of postcapillary venules, combined with counterreceptors expressed by the circulating lymphocytes. The high endothelial venules can selectively guide na\u00efve lymphocytes into the lymph nodes and Peyer's patches by expressing a unique combination of vascular addressins, lymphocyte-specific chemokines, and chemokine-binding molecules. The inflamed postcapillary venules in extralymphoid tissues, such as the skin and intestinal lamina propria, also use a distinct array of endothelial adhesion molecules and tissue- selective chemokines, and support the recruitment of effector and memory lymphocytes that express the appropriate receptors for tissue-specific trafficking. In this review, we summarize the present understanding of the homeostatic recirculation of na\u00efve lymphocytes through the secondary lymphoid tissues and the specific targeting of antigen-experienced lymphocytes into the effector sites. We also revisit some previous studies that reported apparently conflicting observations.",

        "abstract": "Nurse-like stromal cell lines from the synovial tissue of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA-SNC) produce, on coculture with lymphocytes, large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. In the present paper, we analyze the molecular events necessary for the induction of cytokine release from RA-SNC cells, and particularly the roles played by cell adhesion and the transmigration (also known as pseudoemperipolesis) of lymphocytes. For this purpose, the effects of various mAbs on the binding and transmigration of a human B-cell line, MC/car, were examined using a cloned RA-SNC line, RA-SNC77. To analyze the role of lymphocyte binding and transmigration on upregulated cytokine production by the RA-SNC77 cells, we used C3 exoenzyme-treated MC/car cells, which could bind to RA-SNC77 cells but could not transmigrate. Treatment with anti-CD29 or anti-CD49d mAb significantly reduced binding and transmigration of the MC/car cells. In contrast, the neutralizing anti-CD106/vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 mAb did not show any inhibitory effect. Likewise, none of the neutralizing mAbs against CD11a, CD18, CD44, CD49e, or CD54 showed significant effects. Binding of C3-treated or untreated MC/car cells to RA-SNC77 cells induced comparable levels of IL-6 and IL-8 production. In addition, the enhanced cytokine production by RA-SNC77 cells required direct lymphocyte contact via a very late antigen-4 (VLA-4)-independent adhesion pathway. These results indicate that, although both the VLA-4-dependent/vascular cell adhesion molecule 1-independent and the VLA4-independent adhesion pathways are involved in MC/car binding and subsequent transmigration, only the VLA4-independent adhesion pathway is necessary and sufficient for the enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production by RA-SNC77 cells. The transmigration process, which is dependent on Rho-GTPase, is not a prerequisite for this phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "The chemotactic signals regulating cell trafficking in the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infected cornea are well documented, however, those in the cornea-associated tissues, such as the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and draining lymph nodes (LNs), are largely unknown.To examine chemokine expression and subsequent cell infiltration in the HSV-1 infected cornea and its associated tissues.Eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were infected with 10 mu l HSV-1 (CHR3 strain: 5 x 106 PFU/ml) by corneal scarification. Total RNAs were extracted from the corneas, TGs, and LNs at pre-inoculation, 3 days post-inoculation (P.I.) and 7 days P.I. The mRNA for 28 different chemokines in the extracts was amplified by RT-PCR. Infiltrating cells were identified by immunohistochemistry.After the HSV-1 infection, the corneal stroma became edematous by infiltrated cells under the eroded epithelium. The TG and LNs were markedly swollen. The cornea was infiltrated with granulocytes and CD11b+ cells at 3 days P.I., followed by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 12 days P.I. In the TG, CD11b+ cells, but no granulocytes, infiltrated throughout the observation period. T cells migrated into the TG earlier than into the cornea. Gene expressions of neutrophil-attracting chemokines (CXCL1, 2, 3, and 5) increased in the cornea, but they did not enhance in the TG or LNs. On the other hand, gene expressions of chemokines which attract CD11b+ cells such as CCL2, 8, 7, 12, CCL3, 4, and CCL5, increased in the cornea and TG with its peak at 3 days P.I. Gene expressions of chemokines those work on T cells and B cells, such as CCL19, CCL21, CXCL9, CXCL13, CXCL10, XCL1, and CXCL16, were up-regulated and peaked at 3 days P.I. in the cornea and in the TG. Thus, pattern of chemokine gene expression was similar in the cornea and in the TG. On the contrary, gene expressions of chemokines in the draining LNs affecting CD11b+ cells and T cells were temporarily down-regulated.Upon HSV-1 infection, dynamic gene expression of chemokines was observed not only in the inoculated cornea but also in its associated tissues.",

Here we report that CXCL13, expressed in a substantial proportion of HEVs in both lymph nodes (LNs) and Peyer patches (PPs), serves as an arrest chemokine for B cells. Whole-mount analysis of mesenteric LNs (MLNs) showed that, unlike T cells, B cellsa dhere poorly to the HEVs of CXCL13-/- mice and that B-cell adhesion is substantially restored in CXCL13-/- HEVs when CXCL13 is added to the MLNs by superfusion, as we have previously observed in PP HEVs by intravital microscopy. In vitro, CXCL13 activated the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rap1 in B cells, and corroborating this observation, a deficiency of RAPL, the Rap1 effector molecule, caused a significant reduction in shear-resistant B-cell adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). In addition, CXCL13 induced B-cell adhesion to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) by activating alpha4 integrin. These data identify CXCL13 as an arrest chemokine for B cells in HEVs and show that CXCL13 plays an important role in B-cell entry into not only PPs but also MLNs.",

Here we show that, like CD31, nepmucin was localized to interendothelial contacts and to vesicle-like structures along the cell border and underwent intracellular recycling. Functional analyses showed that nepmucin mediated homotypic and heterotypic cell adhesion via its Ig domain. Nepmucin-expressing endothelial cells showed enhanced lymphocyte transendothelial migration (TEM), which was abrogated by anti-nepmucin mAbs that block either homophilic or heterophilic binding. Notably, the mAbs that inhibited homophilic binding blocked TEM without affecting lymphocyte adhesion.

        "abstract": "Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted protein with lysophospholipase D activity that generates lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from lysophosphatidylcholine. Here we report that functional ATX is selectively expressed in high endothelial venules (HEVs) of both lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. ATX expression was developmentally regulated and coincided with lymphocyte recruitment to the lymph nodes. In adults, ATX expression was independent of HEV-expressed chemokines such as CCL21 and CXCL13, innate immunity signals including those via TLR4 or MyD88, and of the extent of lymphocyte trafficking across the HEVs. ATX expression was induced in venules at sites of chronic inflammation. Receptors for the ATX enzyme product LPA were constitutively expressed in HEV endothelial cells (ECs). In vitro, LPA induced strong morphological changes in HEV ECs. Forced ATX expression caused cultured ECs to respond to lysophosphatidylcholine, up-regulating lymphocyte binding to the ECs in a LPA receptor-dependent manner under both static and flow conditions. Although in vivo depletion of circulating ATX did not affect lymphocyte trafficking into the lymph nodes, we surmise, based on the above data, that ATX expressed by HEVs acts on HEVs in situ to facilitate lymphocyte binding to ECs and that ATX in the general circulation does not play a major role in this process. Tissue-specific inactivation of ATX will verify this hypothesis in future studies of its mechanism of action.",

        "abstract": "Lymphocyte extravasation from the high endothelial venules (HEVs) of lymph nodes is crucial for the maintenance of immune homeostasis, but its molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. In this article, we report that lymphocyte transmigration across the basal lamina of the HEVs is regulated, at least in part, by autotaxin (ATX) and its end-product, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). ATX is an HEV-associated ectoenzyme that produces LPA from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which is abundant in the systemic circulation. In agreement with selective expression of ATX in HEVs, LPA was constitutively and specifically detected on HEVs. In vivo, inhibition of ATX impaired the lymphocyte extravasation from HEVs, inducing lymphocyte accumulation within the endothelial cells (ECs) and sub-EC compartment; this impairment was abrogated by LPA. In vitro, both LPA and LPC induced a marked increase in the motility of HEV ECs; LPC's effect was abrogated by ATX inhibition, whereas LPA's effect was abrogated by ATX/LPA receptor inhibition. In an in vitro transmigration assay, ATX inhibition impaired the release of lymphocytes that had migrated underneath HEV ECs, and these defects were abrogated by LPA. This effect of LPA was dependent on myosin II activity in the HEV ECs. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that HEV-associated ATX generates LPA locally; LPA, in turn, acts on HEV ECs to increase their motility, promoting dynamic lymphocyte-HEV interactions and subsequent lymphocyte transmigration across the basal lamina of HEVs at steady state.",

Three different plasmids each targeting a fusion of outer membrane proteins (OprF/OprI), a protein regulating type III secretion system (PcrV), or an appendage (PilA) were prepared and mice were immunized with single (monovalent) or a combination of these plasmids (multivalent) via intramuscular electroporation (imEPT) or gene gun. Immunization with multivalent DNA vaccine via imEPT induced the most potent protection against lethal pneumonia. Although the serum levels of IgG binding to whole bacteria cells were comparable between groups, the strongest immune protection was associated with the serum levels of Th1-dominated multivalent IgG, the bronchoalveolar levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) and IFN-gamma, and the number of neutrophils and macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage following intranasal challenge. These results implied the possible clinical application of multivalent DNA vaccine against P. aeruginosa.",

While the chromophore causes DNA cleavage, the apoprotein functions as its carrier.

In this paper, we report the design and preparation of an engineered C-1027 apoprotein that decelerates this self-decomposition pathway. Our design is based on the kinetic isotope effect, and deuterium is incorporated instead of protium into the hydrogen-abstraction site. The deuterated supra C-1027 was found to have a 4-fold longer lifetime than the natural C-1027.",

        "abstract": "C-1027 is an extremely potent antitumor agent that causes double-stranded DNA cleavages. It is a unique small molecule-protein complex composed of a highly reactive enediyne chromophore, which upon binding reacts with its target molecule DNA through radical-mediated hydrogen abstraction and an apoprotein that encapsulates the chromophore serving as its carrier to reach DNA. Although C-1027 has favorable properties as an effective drug delivery system, it slowly self-decomposes due to the reactivity of the chromophore toward the apoprotein. Understanding how the C-1027 destroys itself may enable design of its analogues that overcome this limitation. In this paper, mechanistic insights into the self-reactivity of C-1027 that facilitates its own decomposition are described. We provide evidence that the formation of the Gly96 radical, which promotes the oxidative protein scission and the subsequent chromophore release, is the major pathway for the self-decomposition of C-1027. On the basis of the newly isolated products of the self-decomposition, we propose that the apoprotein effectively protects two different structural elements of the chromophore that are essential for its biological activity: the nine-membered enediyne moiety (necessary for DNA cleavage) and the benzoxazine moiety (necessary for DNA intercalation). Using an engineered apoprotein analogue kinetically more stable toward the chromophore radical, we show that enhanced overall properties can be achieved for the natural C-1027 with respect to stability and antitumor activities. The results present the first example of a rationally designed C-1027 analogue reported to display superior in vitro antitumor activity to the natural C-1027. Our findings may have implications for design of proteins that can stably encapsulate highly reactive small molecules.",

        "abstract": "C-1027 is one of the most potent antitumor antibiotic chromoproteins, and is a 1:1 complex of an enediyne chromophore having DNA-cleaving ability and a carrier apoprotein. The three-dimensional solution structures of the 110 residue (10.5 kDa) C-1027 apoprotein and its complex with the aromatized chromophore have been determined separately by homonuclear two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The apoprotein is mainly composed of three antiparallel \u03b2-sheets: four-stranded \u03b2-sheet (43\u201345, 52\u201354; 30\u201338; 92\u201394; 104\u2013106), three-stranded \u03b2-sheet (4\u20136; 17\u201322; 61\u201366), and two-stranded \u03b2-sheet (70\u201372; 83\u201385). The overall structure of the apoprotein is very similar to those of other chromoprotein apoproteins, such as neocarzinostatin and kedarcidin. A hydrophobic pocket with approximate dimensions of 14 \u00c5 \u00d7 12 \u00c5 \u00d7 8 \u00c5 is formed by the four-stranded \u03b2-sheet and the three loops (39\u201342; 75\u201379; 97\u2013100). The holoprotein (complex form with the aromatized chromophore) structure reveals that the aromatized chromophore is bound to the hydrophobic pocket found in the apoprotein. The benzodihydropentalene core of the chromophore is located in the center of the pocket and other substituents (\u03b2-tyrosine, benzoxazine, and aminosugar moieties) are arranged around the core. Major binding interactions between the apoprotein and the chromophore are likely the hydrophobic contacts between the core of the chromophore and the hydrophobic side-chains of the pocket-forming residues, which is supplemented by salt bridges and/or hydrogen bonds. Based on the holoprotein structure, we propose possible mechanisms for the stabilization and the release of chromophore by the apoprotein.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Field investigations and indoor experiment were carried out to clarify the effect of temperature and chlorophyll a concentration of the sediment, photon flux density, and ground water level on the absorption and emission of CO 2  from the surface sediment of the artificial salt marsh. The flux of CO 2  absorption was closely related to sediment temperature, chlorophyll a and photon flux density. On the other hand, flux of CO 2  emission changed depending on the sediment temperature and ground water level. The ground water level was thought to be indispensable for estimating CO 2  emission from the sediment of the intertidal zone of the salt marsh. Using equations of CO 2  flux with sediment temperature, chlorophyll a, photon flux density and ground water level, the total CO 2  absorption and emission of the artificial north salt marsh of Osaka Nanko bird sanctuary was estimated as ca. 23\u00a0tons (4.3\u00a0g CO 2 \u00a0m \u22122 \u00a0day \u22121 ) for absorption and ca.14\u00a0tons (2.6\u00a0g CO 2 \u00a0m \u22122 \u00a0day \u22121 ) for emission in May to September 2014. These results suggest that a net of 9\u00a0tons of CO 2  (1.7\u00a0g CO 2 \u00a0m \u22122 \u00a0day \u22121 ) was absorbed, and that this salt marsh performs the function of a CO 2  sink in high temperature seasons.",

This artifact is called metal artifact. Metal artifact can be obstacle when examining objects accurately. Therefore, it is expected that artifact is reduced by a user of X-ray CT. To reduce metal artifact, various methods have been studied but any methods are not compatible with shape of the object and removing metal artifact. In this study, we applied the method with discriminant analysis method and sin curve interpolation. As a result, we could almost remove metal artifact and keep shape of object.

It is important to extract nuclei accurately for the automatic diagnosis supporting system. Cells firstly need to be divided into the blue cells and red ones because cells are dyed in different colors based on type of cell: superficial, intermediate squamous and basal cells. Nuclei are then extracted by superpixel segmentation. Finally, we detect malignant cells by nuclear enlargement and color density of nuclei, and distinguish between positive images and negative ones.",

        "abstract": "L-type amino-acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is the first identified light chain of CD98 molecule, disulfide-linked to a heavy chain of CD98. Following cDNA cloning of chicken full-length LAT1, we have constructed targeting vectors for the disruption of chicken LAT1 gene from genomic DNA of chicken LAT1 consisting of 5.4kb. We established five homozygous LAT1-disrupted (LAT1(-/-)) cell clones, derived from a heterozygous LAT1(+/-) clone of DT40 chicken B cell line. Reactivity of anti-chicken CD98hc monoclonal antibody (mAb) with LAT1(-/-) DT40 cells was markedly decreased compared with that of wild-type DT40 cells. All LAT1(-/-) cells were deficient in L-type amino-acid transporting activity, although alternative-splice variant but not full-length mRNA of LAT1 was detected in these cells. LAT1(-/-) DT40 clones showed outstandingly slow growth in liquid culture and decreased colony-formation capacity in soft agar compared with wild-type DT40 cells. Cell-cycle analyses indicated that LAT1(-/-) DT40 clones have prolonged cell-cycle phases compared with wild-type or LAT1(+/-) DT40 cells. Knockdown of human LAT1 by small interfering RNAs resulted in marked in vitro cell-growth inhibition of human cancer cells, and in vivo tumor growth of HeLa cells in athymic mice was significantly inhibited by anti-human LAT1 mAb. All these results indicate essential roles of LAT1 in the cell proliferation and occurrence of malignant phenotypes and that LAT1 is a promising candidate as a molecular target of human cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Malignant mesothelioma (MM) has a poor prognosis and is largely resistant to standard treatments, so it is important to seek novel therapeutic strategies for this disease. Cancer-initiating cells (CICs) were previously identified in MM using stem cell-associated markers in combination with spheroid cultures. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of CICs in MM remain to be fully explored. Here we showed that the CICs, which had high aldehyde dehydrogenase levels (ALDH) and stem cell-associated genes, were expanded in MM cells cultured under sphere-forming conditions. The MM spheroids also initiated tumors in immunodeficient mice more efficiently than did conventional adherent MM cells. In the MM spheroids, the expression of hyaluronan (HA) synthases was upregulated. Inhibiting the HA synthesis or CD44 functions by gene knockdown or neutralizing antibody abolished the formation of large-sized spheroids and the expansion of ALDH CICs. The expression of activin-A was also increased in the spheroids, and type I activin-A receptor subunit (ALK4) was upregulated in the ALDH CICs. The neutralization of activin-A or functional inactivation of ALK4 diminished the ALDH CICs without affecting spheroid formation. The knockdown of CD44 or ALK4 strongly suppressed the tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. These results together suggest that the HA-CD44 and activin-A-ALK4 pathways differentially regulate the spheroid formation and maintenance of ALDH CICs in MM cells, and that both pathways play critical roles in tumor growth in immunodeficient hosts. Our findings provide a novel therapeutic option for MM that targets signaling pathways that promote the CIC compartment through CD44 and ALK4.",

        "abstract": "Although cancer metastasis is associated with poor prognosis, the mechanisms of this event, especially via lymphatic vessels, remain unclear. Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) is expressed on lymphatic vessel endothelium and is considered to be a specific marker of lymphatic vessels, but it is unknown how LYVE-1 is involved in the growth and metastasis of cancer cells. We produced rat monoclonal antibodies (mAb) recognizing the extracellular domain of mouse LYVE-1, and investigated the roles of LYVE-1 in tumor formation and metastasis. The mAb 38M and 64R were selected from hybridoma clones created by cell fusion between spleen cells of rats immunized with RH7777 rat hepatoma cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused mouse LYVE-1 proteins and mouse myeloma cells. Two mAb reacted with RH7777 and HEK293F human embryonic kidney cells expressing GFP-fused mouse LYVE-1 proteins in a GFP expression-dependent manner, and each recognized a distinct epitope. On immunohistology, the 38M mAb specifically stained lymphatic vessels in several mouse tissues. In the wound healing assay, the 64R mAb inhibited cell migration of HEK293F cells expressing LYVE-1 and mouse lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), as well as tube formation by LEC. Furthermore, this mAb inhibited primary tumor formation and metastasis to lymph nodes in metastatic MDA-MB-231 xenograft models. This shows that LYVE-1 is involved in primary tumor formation and metastasis, and it may be a promising molecular target for cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Chemoimmunoliposomes (CIL) were prepared by entrapping adriamycin in monoclonal antibody (mAb)-coated liposomes and examined for their binding capacity and cytotoxicity to relevant target tumor cells. Sonicated unilamellar liposomes were coated with B3 and HBJ127 mouse, mAbs, which recognize a rat and a homologous human cell proliferation-associated surface antigen, gp125, respectively, and then adriamycin was entrapped in the liposomes by means of transmembrane Na+/K+ gradients using valinomycin. These CIL selectively bound with relevant target tumor cells bearing the corresponding gp125 antigen, such as BC47 rat bladder cancer, FTL-13 rat thymic lymphoma, T24 human bladder cancer and Molt-4 human leukemia cells, although the binding capacities of the CIL to bladder cancer cells were relatively larger than those to lymphoma cells in both rat and human systems. This difference in the target cell binding was found to be attributable to the amount of gp125 antigen expressed on each target tumor cell, as determined by a Scatchard plot analysis. In accordance with the target cell binding capacities of CIL preparations, the CIL displayed much higher cytotoxic activity to bladder cancers than to lymphomas in both rat and human systems. In conjuction with our previous finding that gp125 antigen is expressed on tumor cells but not on resting normal cells, these findings indicate that CIL composed of anti-gp125 mAb will be useful for tumor therapy and that the antitumor efficacy is dependent upon the extent of the antigen expression on target tumor cells.",

These cells are Thy-1+, CD45+, CD3+ and asialo GM1+ but CD5-, CD4-, CD8-, or Ia-1-, and express T cell receptor (TCR) gamma delta. Recently, most of these TCR gamma delta of Thy-1 DEC are shown to consist of a V gamma 3-V delta 1 combination. There has been no evidence that the same type of cell population exists in other species except mice. In this study, we investigated the existence of a Thy-1+DEC equivalent in the rat epidermis. The epidermal sheets obtained from rats were stained with various monoclonal antibodies to rat lymphocytes. We developed a monoclonal antibody (1F4) to rat CD3 complex. 1F4 stained thymocytes and peripheral T cells and also immunoprecipitated T cell receptor with CD3 complex. Using 1F4 and a recently developed monoclonal antibody to rat TCR alpha beta, we could identify dendritic CD4-, CD8-, CD5-, CD3+, TCR alpha beta- cells in the rat epidermis. These CD3+, TCR alpha beta- cells are strong candidates as an equivalent to TCR gamma delta + murine Thy-1+ DEC.",

        "abstract": "A 6 2-year-old woman visited our hospital with a complaint of anal bleeding and was diagnosed with rectal cancer. She underwent low anterior resection and D3 lymphadenectomy. The pathological diagnosis was shown as follows: Ra, Circ, type 2, por1, pSS, ly3, v1, pN2, pStage III b, and KRAS wild type. UFT/UZEL with polysaccharide K(PSK)was initiated as adjuvant chemotherapy after the operation. However, multiple liver metastases were found on CT after 3 courses of UFT/UZEL with PSK, and pathological reexamination revealed that the primary tumor was a neuroendocrine carcinoma. She underwent chemotherapy with CBDCA combined with CPT-11, but bone marrow suppression was observed after 4 courses of the treatment. As second-line chemotherapy, FOLFOX4 plus panitumumab(Pmab)was administered. Although the disease remained stable through 10 courses of FOLFOX4 plus Pmab, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was observed. Hence, FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab(Bmab)was administered as third-line chemotherapy. Twenty-eight courses of FOLFIRI plus Bmab were administered, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE)was performed during chemotherapy. However, her general condition worsened after the therapies, and she died 2 years 3 months after the initial chemotherapy. ",

        "abstract": "We have investigated gravity anomalies around the Niigata plain, which is a sedimentary basin in central Japan bounded by mountains, to examine the continuity of subsurface fault structures of a large fault zone\u2014the eastern boundary fault zone of the Niigata plain (EBFZNP). The features of the Bouguer anomaly and its first horizontal and vertical derivatives clearly illustrate the EBFZNP. The steep first horizontal derivative and the zero isoline of the vertical derivative are clearly recognized along the entire EBFZNP over an area that shows no surface topographic features of an active fault. Two-dimensional density structure analyses also confirm a relationship between the two first derivatives and the subsurface fault structure. Therefore, we conclude that the length of the EBFZNP as an active fault extends to ~56 km, which is longer than previously estimated. This length leads to an estimation of a moment magnitude of 7.4 of an expected earthquake from the EBFZNP.Open image in new windowGraphical abstract.",

The approach does not require the explicit knowledge of incident fields illuminating the object and the time-reversed fields are calculated by time-reversing the equivalent current sources determined by the total fields recorded on a measurement line. This gradient based inverse approach can deal with a reconstruction of lossy object. Numerical simulations are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

An initial-boundary value problem is set up whose solution coincides with that of the original scattering problem in the interior region bounded by the observation surface if and only if a medium inside the observation surface is the same as that of the original one. A cost functional consisting the stored energy of the misfit field between the original problem and the boundary value problem with an estimated object is introduced to solve the inverse problem. Preliminary numerical examples are provided to assess the proposed inversion approach.",

        "abstract": "Time reversal imaging methods have received considerable attention since they yield accurate location estimate of point scatterers. Up to now, most time reversal methods have focused on detection and localization of point-like or small targets [1, 2] and not dealt with estimation of electrical parameter profile of scatterers. We have proposed a gradient based time-reversal imaging technique which can reconstruct electrical parameter distributions of the unknown object [3]. This method is based on the field equivalence principle and does not require the explicit knowledge of the incident field [4]. In this problem, the following functional of the parameters equation is to be minimized equation where equation is the region exterior to the measurement surface S and T is the measurement time. The field u n (p; r, t) is the solution of Maxwell equation for time reversed fields with the estimated parameters p under the n-th illumination. The quantity c is the light speed of the background. Due to the nonlinearity of the inverse scattering problem, the solution based on gradient methods often gets trapped into a local minimum. In order to avoid this problem, the filtered forward-backward time-stepping (FBTS) technique is used [5]. In this technique, the measured total field data is processed through a low-pass filter with several cut-off frequency sequences and these filtered data are solved by FBTS method. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Forward-Backward Time-Stepping Method (FBTS method) is a technique to solve time domain inverse scattering problem. An incident pulse is radiated to unknown object. The scattering wave is measured at M points. A similar measurement is carried out at N different incident points. Total number of measured data is M \u00d7 N. In FBTS method, the estimated field is calculated by FDTD method. The number of calculation on FDTD method is required only the number of incident points. Most on computing time by FBTS method is occupied by calculation of FDTD method. Therefore the method that the incident pulse was emitted at the same time at N different point was suggested. In this method, computing time becomes about 1/N compared with a usual FBTS method. However accuracy of reconstruction image degrades. In this research, time-delay FBTS method is proposed. The number of the measured electric field is M \u00d7 N like a normal FBTS method. In the case of a linear medium, a theorem of the superposition holds good. Therefore, the total electric fields at each observation points are got by adding measured field for each incidence pulse when a pulse was radiated at the same time at different incident points. It is not necessary to be simultaneous the start time of electromagnetic pulse emitted from each incident point. That is, the start time of the radiation pulse can be changed by the incident points. Difference between the start times of the radiation pulses is referred to as a time-delay. Different time-delay is given the different total electric field. Itu0027s possible to get a measured field of many simultaneous incidences by introducing different time-delay to the same measured field. Itu0027s possible to improve the accuracy of the reconstruction image by using some delay times. Also, when time delay becomes longer than observation time to radiation of a pulse, presented method becomes same as a usual FBTS method. The validity of the presented technique is indicated by some numerical simulations.",

As a proof of concept, we develop a microstrip-based periodic leaky-wave antenna driven by a vector network analyzer. By sweeping the frequency from 235 to 325\u00a0GHz, beam steering from    $-hbox{23}^circ$   to +  $hbox{15}^circ$    across the broadside can be achieved with a nearly constant beam width of 4   $^circ$  . Small target detection is demonstrated by locating a metal cylinder with a diameter of 12\u00a0mm placed 46\u201386\u00a0mm in front of the antenna with a mean error of 2.4\u00a0mm. The use of a leaky-wave antenna can pave the way for developing a low-loss, low-profile, and wide-aperture terahertz radar. Importantly, it can be integrated with a solid-state source and a detector. The proposed approach is particularly promising for use with emerging small devices such as drones or wearable devices, where millimeter-wave radar is not suitable in terms of the resolution and system footprint.",

In this study, we identified the antigen of 4C8 mAb as CD52. Costimulation with Campath-1H, a humanized anti-CD52 mAb, also induced Treg cells. Anti-CD52-induced Treg cells suppressed the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells provided with polyclonal or allogeneic stimulation. When Treg cells were induced from Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) treated cells, they suppressed the response to SEB more efficiently than that to another superantigen, SEA. Furthermore, anti-CD52-induced Treg cells could be expanded by culture with IL-2 followed by CD52-costimulation, and co-injection of expanded Treg cells suppressed lethal xenogeneic graft versus host disease (GvHD) reactions in SCID mice caused by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).",

        "abstract": "In humans, computed tomography (CT) is a widely performed technique for the diagnosis and staging of gastric tumors. The purpose of this retrospective case series study was to describe CT findings in a group of dogs with confirmed gastric tumors. For each included dog, the following CT parameters were recorded: gastric tumor location, tumor shape, gastric involvement pattern, tumor enhancement pattern in early and late phases, presence and location of lymphadenopathy, gastric tumor attenuation values, attenuation values of enlarged lymph nodes, maximum short-axis diameter (mm) of enlarged lymph node, maximum long-axis diameter (mm) of enlarged lymph node, and short-axis diameter to long-axis diameter ratio (short axis/long axis). A total of 16 dogs met inclusion criteria and had the following final diagnoses: five lymphoma, six adenocarcinoma, three inflammatory polyps, and two leiomyoma. In the early- and delayed-phase postcontrast images, the mean CT attenuation value for lymphoma was lower than that of other gastric tumors. Lymphadenopathy was widespread in lymphomas and regional in adenocarcinomas. Lymphadenopathy was not detected in leiomyomas. Lymph node measurements in lymphoma were larger than lymph node measurements in adenocarcinoma. Although there were overlapping findings for the different types of gastric tumors, contrast-enhanced CT provided helpful information for characterizing gastric tumors based on the following criteria: early and late enhancement patterns, the site of origin of the mass lesion, and extent of local invasion and distant metastases. Lymphoma should be considered for canine gastric tumors with low mean attenuation values during early- and delayed-phase postcontrast images, and widespread, bulky, and rounded lymphadenopathy.",

        "abstract": "Zero-determinant (ZD) strategies, a recently found novel class of strategies in repeated games, has attracted much attention in evolutionary game theory. A ZD strategy unilaterally enforces a linear relation between average payoffs of players. Although existence and evolutional stability of ZD strategies have been studied in simple games, their mathematical properties have not been well-known yet. For example, what happens when more than one players employ ZD strategies have not been clarified. In this paper, we provide a general framework for investigating situations where more than one players employ ZD strategies in terms of linear algebra. First, we theoretically prove that a set of linear relations of average payoffs enforced by ZD strategies always has solutions, which implies that incompatible linear relations are impossible. Second, we prove that linear payoff relations are independent of each other under some conditions. These results hold for general incomplete-information games including complete-information games. Furthermore, as an application of linear algebraic formulation, we provide a simple example of a two-player game in which one player can simultaneously enforce two linear relations, that is, simultaneously control her and her opponentu0027s average payoffs. All of these results elucidate general mathematical properties of ZD strategies.",

The gas accreting on a PBH heats up by the release of the gravitational energy. As a result, the heated gas in the vicinity of the PBH emits the UV and X-ray photons. These photons can ionize and heat the intergalactic medium (IGM) around the PBH. Assuming the simple model of these emitting photons, we compute the profiles of the IGM ionization fraction and temperature around a PBH. Using these profiles, we evaluate the Compton $y$-parameter created by the IGM gas around a PBH. Finally, we estimate the CMB temperature angular power spectrum due to the PBH SZ effect in our model. We show that the SZ temperature anisotropy due to the PBHs has the flat angular power spectrum on small scale, $lleq2000$ and could dominate the primordial temperature spectrum on smaller scales than the Silk scale. This flat spectrum extends to the scale of the ionized region by the PBH emission. We also discuss the impact of the small-scale CMB measurement on the PBH abundance based on our results.",
