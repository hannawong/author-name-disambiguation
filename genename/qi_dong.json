        "abstract": "The Allen Brain Atlas shows that the semaphorin 5A (SEMA5A) gene, which encodes an important protein for neurogenesis and neuronal apoptosis, is predominantly expressed in the human hippocampus. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies have further shown that the hippocampus plays an important role in the performance on Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), a measure of reasoning ability and general fluid intelligence. Thus far, however, no study has examined the relationships between the SEMA5A gene polymorphism, hippocampal volume, and RPM performance. The current study collected both structural MRI, genetic, and behavioral data in 329 healthy Chinese adults, and examined associations between SEMA5A variants, hippocampal volume, and performance on RAPM (the advanced form of RPM). After controlling for intracranial volume (ICV), sex, and age, SEMA5A genetic polymorphism at the SNP rs42352 had the strongest association with hippocampal volume (p=0.00000552 and 0.000103 for right and left hippocampal volumes, respectively), with TT homozygotes having higher hippocampal volume than the other genotypes. Furthermore, there was a high correlation between right hippocampal volume and RAPM performance (r=0.42, p=0.0000509) for SEMA5A rs42352 TT homozygotes. This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of the SEMA5A gene in hippocampal structure and their interaction on RAPM performance. Future studies of the hippocampus-RPM associations should consider genetic factors as potential moderators.",

        "title": "Unbiased age-specific structural brain atlases for Chinese pediatric population.",
        "abstract": "In magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies of child brain development, structural brain atlases usually serve as important references for the pediatric population, in which individual images are spatially normalized into a common or standard stereotactic space. However, the popular existing pediatric brain atlases (e.g., National Institutes of Health pediatric atlases, NIH-PD) are mostly based on MR images obtained from Caucasian populations and thus are not ideal for the characterization of the brains of Chinese children due to neuroanatomical differences related to genetic and environmental factors. Here, we use an unbiased template construction algorithm to create a set of age-specific Chinese pediatric (CHN-PD) atlases based on high-quality T1-and T2-weighted MR images from 328 cognitively normal Chinese children aged 6-12 years. The CHN-PD brain atlases include asymmetric and symmetric templates, sex-specific templates and tissue probability templates, and contain multiple age-specific templates at one-year intervals. A direct comparison of the CHN-PD and NIH-PD atlases reveals dramatic anatomical differences mainly in the bilateral frontal and parietal regions. After applying the CHN-PD and NIH-PD atlases to two independent Chinese pediatric datasets (N = 114 and N = 71), we find that the CHN-PD atlases result in significantly higher accuracy than the NIH-PD atlases in both predicting \"brain age\" and guiding brain tissue segmentation. These results suggest that the CHN-PD brain atlases are necessary for studies of the typical and atypical development of the Chinese pediatric population. These CHN-PD atlases have been released on the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) website (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/chn-pd).",

In addition to serving as a redox trigger, an electrochemical toggle switch was developed in which the chemoselectivity for lactide and epoxide polymerization was altered in situ.

        "abstract": "The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoTs) and pervasive use of many different types of mobile computing devices make wireless communication spectrum a precious resource. In order to accommodate the still fast increasing number of devices requesting wireless connection, more efficient, fine-grained spectrum allocation and sharing schemes are badly in need. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been widely recognized as one promising solution, in which the secondary users (SUs) are allowed to share channels with licensed primary users (PUs) as long as bringing no interference to the normal operations of the PUs. However, malicious attackers or selfish SUs may mimic the behavior of PUs to occupy the channels illegally. It is nontrivial to accurately, timely detect such kind of primary user emulation (PUE) attacks. In this paper, an efficient PUE attacked detection method is introduced leveraging the recurrent neural network (RNN). After a fundamental algorithm using basic RNN, an advanced version taking advantage of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) is proposed, which is more efficient on processing time series with long term memory. The experimental study has provided deeper insights about the different performances the RNNs achieved and validated the effectiveness of the proposed detectors.",

Spatial ICA (SICA) is applied widely in fMRI data because the spatial dimension of fMRI data is larger than their temporal dimension. The general linear model (GLM) is based on a priori knowledge about stimulation paradigm. In our study, a two-task cognitive experiment was designed, and SICA and GLM were applied to analyze these fMRI data. Both methods could easily find some common areas activated by two tasks. However, SICA could also find more accurate areas activated by different single task in specific brain areas than GLM. The results demonstrate that ICA methodology can supply us more information or the intrinsic structure of the data especially when multitask-related components are presented in the data.",

        "abstract": "Using an artificial-number learning paradigm and the ERP technique, the present study investigated neural mechanisms involved in the learning of magnitude and spatial order. 54 college students were divided into 2 groups matched in age, gender, and school major. One group was asked to learn the associations between magnitude (dot patterns) and the meaningless Gibson symbols, and the other group learned the associations between spatial order (horizontal positions on the screen) and the same set of symbols. Results revealed differentiated neural mechanisms underlying the learning processes of symbolic magnitude and spatial order. Compared to magnitude learning, spatial-order learning showed a later and reversed distance effect. Furthermore, an analysis of the order-priming effect showed that order was not inherent to the learning of magnitude. Results of this study showed a dissociation between magnitude and order, which supports the numerosity code hypothesis of mental representations of magnitude.",

IHC, IF, IB, and real-time PCR were used to detect CRT expression in PC, while transfection and drug intervention were used to investigate the functional relationship of CRT with other signaling genes. IHC showed both CRT and p53 expression was significantly increased in PC, compared to that in paired non-cancerous pancreatic tissues (P < 0.001). High expression of CRT was positively associated with tumor UICC stage and lymph nodes metastasis (P = 0.034 and P = 0.015), and was an independent adverse prognostic indicator in patients with PC. No relationship was found between CRT and p53 expression in spearman's rank correlation test. Altered expression of CRT did not change p53, MDM2, pho-AKT, pho-p38, and pho-JNK expression, but had a specific regulation on pho-ERK. Meanwhile, CRT-regulated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC cells in MEK/ERK pathway dependent manner. In addition, CRT knockdown significantly decreased pho-ERK expression and cell chemoresistance independent of activated p53 and caspase-3-related apoptosis in gemcitabine- or oxaliplatin-treated Capan-2 cells. Our study first demonstrated that overexpression of CRT contributed to the development and progression of PC through MEK/ERK-signaling pathway but independent of p53. The interaction between CRT and MEK/ERK pathway might provide a new idea for revealing malignant biology and supplying new gene targeted chemotherapy of PC.",

Compared to traditional block design, efMRI design has many methodolgical advantages, including the flexibility in arranging and presenting stimulus, the high efficiency in excluding the influence of irrelevent factors and the accurracy in describing the profile of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. In addition, in efMRI design, the trials can be categorized pos hoc, and the result is more easy to be compared with and integrated into that of EPRs, dichotic listening and half visual-fields presentation. Above all of this, the efMRI itself has experienced a drastic development in recent years. For all these merits, efMRI has been wildly adopted by current researches on cognitive neuroscience, and thus has resulted in many important findings in the brain mechanism underling perception, attention, memory, thinking, language and other high-level cognitive functions.",

        "abstract": "Previous case-control and family-based association studies have implicated the SLC6A4 gene in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Little research, however, has examined this gene's role in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) in community samples. The present study genotyped seven tag SNPs and two common functional tandem repeat polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR and STin2), which together cover the whole SLC6A4 gene, and investigated their associations with OCS in normal Chinese college students (N = 572). The results revealed a significant gender main effect and gender-specific genetic effects of the SLC6A4 gene on OCS. Males scored significantly higher on total OCS and its three dimensions than did females (ps < .01). The 5-HTTLPR in the promoter region showed a female-specific genetic effect, with the l/l and l/s genotypes linked to higher OCS scores than the s/s genotype (ps < .05). In contrast, a conserved haplotype polymorphism (rs1042173| rs4325622| rs3794808| rs140701| rs4583306| rs2020942) covering from intron 3 to the 3' UTR of the SLC6A4 gene showed male-specific genetic effects, with the CGAAGG/CGAAGG genotype associated with lower OCS scores than the other genotypes (ps < .05). These effects remained significant after controlling for OCS-related factors including participants' depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as stressful life events, and correction for multiple tests. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for our understanding of the sex-specific role of the different sections of the SLC6A4 gene in OCD.",

        "abstract": "Although behavioral and neuropsychological studies have suggested two distinct routes of phonological access, their neural substrates have not been clearly elucidated. Here, we designed an artificial language (based on Korean Hangul) that can be read either through addressed (i.e., whole word mapping) or assembled (i.e., grapheme-to-phoneme mapping) phonology. Two matched groups of native English-speaking participants were trained in one of the two conditions, one hour per day for eight days. Behavioral results showed that both groups correctly named more than 90% of the trained words after training. At the neural level, we found a clear dissociation of the neural pathways for addressed and assembled phonologies: There was greater involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, right orbital frontal cortex, angular gyrus and middle temporal gyrus for addressed phonology, but stronger activation in the left precentral gyrus/inferior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus for assembled phonology. Furthermore, we found evidence supporting the strategy-shift hypothesis, which postulates that, with practice, reading strategy shifts from assembled to addressed phonology. Specifically, compared to untrained words, trained words in the assembled phonology group showed stronger activation in the addressed phonology network and less activation in the assembled phonology network. Our results provide clear brain-imaging evidence for the dual-route models of reading.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Development of the Li-O 2  battery into a practical technology hinges on the availability of a stable electrolyte. Because of the high reactivity of oxygen species in the system, no known organic electrolytes meet the stability requirements. The search for a suitable electrolyte system remains an outstanding challenge in Li-O 2  battery research. Here, we show that the issue can be solved with the use of a water-in-salt electrolyte system that involves no organic solvents. In essence, the electrolyte consists of super-concentrated LiTFSI (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), in which H 2 O molecules are locked to the ions and exhibit little reactivity toward Li 2 O 2  or other oxygen species. The net result is a highly effective electrolyte that permits stable Li-O 2  battery operations on the cathode with superior cycle lifetimes. A new door to practical Li-O 2  batteries with high performance is opened up.",

The present study investigated this issue by examining the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium of genotype frequencies of 284 SNPs covering major neurotransmitter genes in a sample of 478 Chinese college students, comparing these frequencies with those of a community sample (the 1000 Genomes dataset), and examining behavioral correlates of the SNPs in Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium. Results showed that 24 loci showed Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium among college students, but only two of these were in disequilibrium in the 1000 Genomes sample. These loci were found to be associated with mathematical abilities, executive functions, motivation, and adjustment-related behaviors such as alcohol use and emotion recognition. Generally, genotypes overrepresented in the college sample showed better performance and adjustment than under-represented or non-biased genotypes. This study illustrates a new approach to studying genetic correlates of traits associated with a socially-selected group—college students—and presents the first evidence of genetic stratification in terms of education attainment.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested differential engagement of the bilateral fusiform gyrus in the processing of Chinese and English. The present study tested the possibility that long-term experience with Chinese language affects the fusiform laterality of English reading by comparing three samples: Chinese speakers, English speakers with Chinese experience, and English speakers without Chinese experience. We found that, when reading words in their respective native language, Chinese and English speakers without Chinese experience differed in functional laterality of the posterior fusiform region (right laterality for Chinese speakers, but left laterality for English speakers). More importantly, compared with English speakers without Chinese experience, English speakers with Chinese experience showed more recruitment of the right posterior fusiform cortex for English words and pseudowords, which is similar to how Chinese speakers processed Chinese. These results suggest that long-term experience with Chinese shapes the fusiform laterality of English reading and have important implications for our understanding of the cross-language influences in terms of neural organization and of the functions of different fusiform subregions in reading.",

        "abstract": "Using the standard parity judgment task, this study investigated the development of numerical-spatial representation. Participants were 314 healthy right-handed Chinese children (from kindergarteners to sixth graders) and adults. The results revealed that all age groups showed a significant (or marginally significant in the case of first graders) SNARC (spatial-numerical association of response codes) effect, indicating that Chinese children as young as kindergarteners already had developed automatic spatial representations of numbers (or the mental number line). Surprisingly, however, the size of the SNARC effect did not show much developmental change. These results are discussed in the context of the literature on spatial representations of numbers and on cross-cultural differences in early development of number cognition.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the relation between genetic variations in the dopamine system and facial expression recognition.A sample of Chinese college students (n = 478) was given a facial expression recognition task. Subjects were genotyped for 98 loci [96 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2 variable number tandem repeats] in 16 genes involved in the dopamine neurotransmitter system, including its 4 subsystems: synthesis (TH, DDC, and DBH), degradation/transport (COMT,MAOA,MAOB, and SLC6A3), receptors (DRD1,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4, and DRD5), and modulation (NTS,NTSR1,NTSR2, and NLN). To quantify the total contributions of the dopamine system to emotion recognition, we used a series of multiple regression models. Permutation analyses were performed to assess the posterior probabilities of obtaining such results.Among the 78 loci that were included in the final analyses (after excluding 12 SNPs that were in high linkage disequilibrium and 8 that were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), 1 (for fear), 3 (for sadness), 5 (for anger), 13 (for surprise), and 15 (for disgust) loci exhibited main effects on the recognition of facial expressions. Genetic variations in the dopamine system accounted for 3% for fear, 6% for sadness, 7% for anger, 10% for surprise, and 18% for disgust, with the latter surviving a stringent permutation test.Genetic variations in the dopamine system (especially the dopamine synthesis and modulation subsystems) made significant contributions to individual differences in the recognition of disgust faces.",

Gender, stressful life events, perceived parental warmth, and conflict with parents were associated in the expected direction with depressive symptoms in each cultural setting. As predicted, regression analyses showed that the quality of family relationships and grades in school had significantly stronger associations with depressive symptoms among Chinese youths than among U.S. youths, whereas gender differences in depressive symptoms were greater among the U.S. youths. Peer warmth moderated the effects of particular risk factors for depressive symptoms in each cultural setting.",

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and representational similarity analysis of brain activity, we found that, compared with forgotten items, subsequently remembered faces and words showed greater similarity in neural activation across multiple study in many brain regions, including (but not limited to) the regions whose mean activities were correlated with subsequent memory. This result addresses a longstanding debate in the study of memory by showing that successful episodic memory encoding occurs when the same neural representations are more precisely reactivated across study episodes, rather than when patterns of activation are more variable across time.",

        "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous neurotransmitter, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Accordingly, several polymorphisms of the gene that codes for the main NO-producing enzyme, the nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), have been found to convey a risk for schizophrenia. This study examined the role of NOS1 gene polymorphisms in cognitive functions and related neural mechanism. First, with a sample of 580 schizophrenia patients and 720 healthy controls, we found that rs3782206 genotype had main effects on the 1-back task (P=0.005), the 2-back task (P=0.049), the AY condition of the dot-pattern expectancy (DPX) task (P=0.001), and the conflict effect of the attention network (ANT) test (P<0.001 for RT differences and P=0.002 for RT ratio) and interaction effects with diagnosis on the BX condition of the DPX (P=0.009), the AY condition of the DPX (P<0.001), and the Stroop conflict effect (P=0.003 for RT differences and P=0.038 for RT ratio). Simple effect analyses further showed that the schizophrenia risk allele (T) of rs3782206 was associated with poorer performance in five measures for the patients (1-back, P=0.025; BX, P=0.017; AY, P<0.001; ANT conflict effect (RT differences), P=0.005; Stroop conflict effect (RT differences), P=0.019) and three measures for the controls ( for the 2-back task, P=0.042; for the ANT conlict effect (RT differences), P=0.013; for the ANT conflict effect (RT ratios), P=0.028). Then, with a separate sample of 78 healthy controls, we examined the association between rs3782206 and brain activation patterns during the N-back task and the Stroop task. Whole brain analyses found that the risk allele carriers showed reduced activation at the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during both tasks. Finally, we examined functional connectivity seeded from the right IFG to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex under three conditions (the N-back task, the Stroop task, and the resting state). Results showed reduced connectivity with the DLPFC for the risk allele carriers mainly in the Stroop task and the resting state. Taken together, results of this study strongly suggested a link between NOS1 gene polymorphism at rs3782206 and cognitive functions and their neural underpinnings at the IFG. These results have important implications for our understanding of the neural mechanism underlying the association between NOS1 gene polymorphism and schizophrenia.",

The target segments 837 bp and 840 bp were amplifi ed from Agrobacterium plasmid DNA, respectively. It showed that Agrobacterium was suitable for the next transformation experiment. T1 resistant plant was obtained from the 1/2 MS medium comprising Kan (50 mg/L) by screening the seeds (T0) of the transformed Arabidopsis plants. The transformation rate was about 0.1%.

        "abstract": "Existing cognitive and neural imaging studies have suggested a frontoparietal network of multiple, cooperative components for verbal working memory (WM). We used functional MRI to investigate whether this neural network is also involved in the processing of second language by nonfluent bilinguals. Twelve (five males, seven females) native Chinese speakers who had limited English proficiency were scanned while performing working memory tasks in Chinese and English. They were asked to make judgment continuously whether the word presented on the screen was semantically related to (i.e., the semantic tasks) another word presented two words earlier. On a different task (i.e., the phonological tasks), they were asked to make judgment whether the target word rhymed with the other word. A naming and judgment task in each language was adopted to control for the visual process, initial lexical process, and motor responses. Behavioral data showed that subjects performed better at tasks in their native language (Chinese, L1) than in English (L2). Imaging results showed that all working memory tasks in both L1 and L2 elicited a very similar pattern of left-hemisphere-dominated activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, pars opercularis region, pars triangularis region, precentral cortex, and parietal lobule. Consistent with the behavioral data, the volume of activation in the left opercularis region, left parietal lobule, and right precentral region was greater for L2 than for L1. These results suggest that working memory in L1 and L2 is mediated by a unitary neural system (i.e., frontoparietal region), which is capable of recruiting surrounding cortical resources to meet the increased computational demand caused by low L2 proficiency.",

Using a large sample of 416 college students and 7 reading tasks, the present study successfully identified three uncorrelated components of reading ability: phonological decoding, form-sound association, and naming speed. We then tried to predict individuals' scores in these components from their gray matter volume (GMV) on a subset of participants (N = 253) with high-quality structural images, adopting a multivariate support vector regression analysis with tenfold cross-validation. Our results revealed distinct neural regions that supported different aspects of reading ability: whereas phonological decoding was associated with the GMV in the left superior parietal lobe extending to the supramarginal gyrus, form-sound association was predicted by the GMV in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Naming speed was associated with GMV in distributed brain regions in the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices. Phonological decoding and form-sound association were uncorrelated with general cognitive abilities. However, naming speed was correlated with intelligence and processing speed, and some of the regions that were predictive of naming speed also predicted these general cognitive abilities. These results provide further insights on the cognitive and neural architecture of reading and the structural basis of individual differences in reading abilities.",

However, training CNNs relies heavily on the availability of exhaustive training data annotations, limiting significantly their deployment and scalability in many application scenarios. In this work, we introduce a generic unsupervised deep learning approach to training deep models without the need for any manual label supervision. Specifically, we progressively discover sample anchored/centred neighbourhoods to reason and learn the underlying class decision boundaries iteratively and accumulatively. Every single neighbourhood is specially formulated so that all the member samples can share the same unseen class labels at high probability for facilitating the extraction of class discriminative feature representations during training. Experiments on image classification show the performance advantages of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning models on six benchmarks including both coarse-grained and fine-grained object image categorisation.",

Twelve right-handed Chinese children (mean age = 11.6 years) were scanned while performing semantic and phonological tasks. Strong leftward asymmetry was found in the left inferior frontal cortex (BA44/45/47), the parietal lobule (BA40), and the cingulate cortex (BA24/32). In the visual system, we found significant left-hemispheric dominance in the fusiform cortex (BA19/37), but no asymmetry was found in the primary visual cortex (BA17/18). The differential results for the primary visual cortex versus high-order visual cortex (i.e., the fusiform cortex) are discussed in terms of the contribution of the logographic nature of Chinese characters to the asymmetry pattern in the hierarchical visual system.",

        "abstract": "Previous functional neuroimaging studies have shown that the left mid-fusiform cortex plays a critical role in reading. However, there is very limited research relating this region's anatomical structure to reading performance either in native or second language. Using structural MRI and three reading tasks (Chinese characters, English words, and alphabetic pseudowords) and a non-reading task (visual-auditory learning), this study investigated the contributions of the left mid-fusiform cortical thickness to reading in a large sample of 226 Chinese subjects. Results showed that the cortical thickness in the left mid-fusiform gyrus was positively correlated with performance on all three reading tasks but not with the performance on the non-reading task. Our findings provide structural evidence for the left mid-fusiform cortex as the \"gateway\" region for reading Chinese and English. The absence of the association between the left mid-fusiform cortical thickness and non-reading performance implied the specific role of this area in reading skills, not in general language skills.",

In the research reported here, 1,556 pupils (8 to 11 years of age) from urban and rural regions in the greater Beijing area completed 10 cognitive tasks. Results showed that girls outperformed boys in arithmetic tasks (i.e., simple subtraction, complex multiplication), as well as in numerosity-comparison, number-comparison, number-series-completion, choice reaction time, and word-rhyming tasks. Boys outperformed girls in a mental rotation task. Controlling for scores on the word-rhyming task eliminated gender differences in arithmetic, whereas controlling for scores on numerical-processing tasks (number comparison, numerosity estimation, numerosity comparison, and number-series completion) and general cognitive tasks (choice reaction time, Raven’s Progressive Matrices, and mental rotation) did not.

        "abstract": "The laterality difference in the occipitotemporal region between Chinese (bilaterality) and alphabetic languages (left laterality) has been attributed to their difference in visual appearance. However, these languages also differ in orthographic transparency. To disentangle the effect of orthographic transparency from visual appearance, we trained subjects to read the same artificial script either as an alphabetic (i.e., transparent orthography) or a logographic (i.e., nontransparent orthography) language. Consistent with our previous results, both types of phonological training enhanced activations in the left fusiform gyrus. More interestingly, the laterality in the fusiform gyrus (especially the posterior region) was modulated by the orthographic transparency of the artificial script (more left-lateralized activation after alphabetic training than after logographic training). These results provide an alternative account (i.e., orthographic transparency) for the laterality difference between Chinese and alphabetic languages, and may have important implications for the role of the fusiform in reading.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder, and the onset of which is preceded by a stage of ultrahigh risk (UHR) for developing psychosis. Therefore, analyzing individuals with UHR is essential for identifying predictive biomarkers for the onset of schizophrenia. The current study aimed to identify such biomarkers based on a voxelwise whole-brain functional degree centrality (FDC) analysis. Conjunction analysis showed that, compared with healthy controls, both UHR subjects and patients with schizophrenia showed significantly increased FDC at the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and significantly decreased FDC at the right fusiform gyrus (FG). The subsequent partial correlation analysis showed significant correlations between the disorganization symptoms and FDCs at the MPFC and the right FG for both UHR subjects and patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that FDC within the MPFC and the right FG could be candidate biomarkers for the onset of schizophrenia.",

The GF has been traditionally considered as a heuristic bias supported by the fast and automatic intuition system, which can be overcome by the reasoning system. The present study examined an intriguing hypothesis, based on emerging evidence from neuroscience research, that the GF might be attributed to a weak affective but strong cognitive decision making mechanism. With data from a large sample of college students, we found that individuals' use of the GF strategy was positively correlated with their general intelligence and executive function, such as working memory and conflict resolution, but negatively correlated with their affective decision making capacities, as measured by the Iowa Gambling Task. Our result provides a novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the GF, which highlights the significant role of affective mechanisms in adaptive decision-making.",

The present study aimed to extend that study to investigate sex-dependent neurofunctional predictors of long-term maintenance. Twenty-three Chinese college students trained in the previous study were followed up twice: immediately (T1) and 6 months after the training (T2). At both T1 and T2, subjects were tested with the simultaneously presented same-different judgment task. Compared with the T1 performance, subjects (both males and females) showed a small but significant amount of forgetting (i.e., longer reaction times) at T2. Consistent with our hypothesis, males' performance at both T1 and T2 was predicted by the pre-training left-lateralized fusiform activation, whereas females' performance was predicted by symmetrical bilateral fusiform activation.",

The results found that: (1) the primary school students’ English classroom anxiety increase with the rise of grades,and the level of anxiety of students in grade 5 and 6 is significantly higher than those in grade 3 and 4;(2)Communicating anxiety and testing anxiety are the two main types of anxiety in primary school;(3) No significant gender difference was found in all the three aspects of English classroom anxiety;(4)Teachers’ negative reaction and evaluation,encouragement and assistance are the major predictors of students’ English classroom anxiety. These founding indicated that teachers and parents should pay more attention to the English classroom anxiety of students in higher grades,and English teachers should try to give students more positive evaluation,which will be very helpful to reduce their English classroom anxiety.",

Twenty healthy undergraduate students were scanned while they performed a number-matching task. Relative to matched numbers, unmatched numbers elicited significantly greater activation at left inferior and superior parietal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left fusiform and lingual gyri. Combining these results and those of previous studies on semantic anomaly, we proposed that the parietal region is the source of the arithmetic N400 component and the left inferior frontal gyrus is involved in domain-general processing of anomalous information.",

METHODS:A retrospective analysis of 75 malignant colorectal obstruction patients who were treated at Liaoning Provincial People's Hospital between 2003 and 2008 was performed. The patients were divided into three groups, a control group(n = 30) treated using traditional methods, a stent placement group(n = 30) treated using self-expanding metal stents, and a stent placement plus chemotherapy group(n = 15) treated using self-expanding metal stents in combina-tion with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS:The percentage of surgical patients undergoing colostomy was significantly higher in the control group than in the stent placement group and the stent placement plus chemotherapy group(62.5% vs 30.0%, 25.0%, 2= 4.619, 4.500, both P < 0.05). The tumor resection rate was significantly lower in the control group than in the stent placement group and the stent placement plus chemotherapy group(37.5% vs 70.0%, 75.0%, 2= 4.619, 4.500, both P < 0.05). The radical surgery rate was significantly higher in the stent placement plus chemotherapy than in the control group(41.7% vs 12.5%, 2= 3.938, P < 0.05), but showed no significant difference between the control group and stent placement group( 2= 0.059, P > 0.05). The five-year survival rate was significantly higher in the stent placement plus chemotherapy group than in the control group(26.7% vs 3.3%, 2= 5.513, P < 0.05), but showed no significant difference between the control group and stent placement group( 2 = 1.071, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION:Endoscopic stenting combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy can effectively improve tumor resection rate and radical surgery rate and prolong survival time in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "Previous research has confirmed the age-old wisdom that verbal materials are better remembered when presented in musical forms(e.g.,songs) than in other forms(e.g.,regular speech).Furthermore,several studies have shown that music training can improve individuals' verbal memory.These studies,however,had three limitations: they were conducted mainly with adults,they examined only verbal memory in native language,and they did not investigate potential interactive effects between music training and mode of presentation. In the present study,112 children were recruited from a local primary school.About half of them(n=55) had received three or more years of regular formal music training(mainly piano).The rest(n=57) had received minimal(half a year or less,and mostly none) music training.Subjects within each group were randomly assigned to one of three presentation conditions: song,rhythm,and speech.In the \"song\" condition,subjects were asked to remember four carefully selected lines(27 words) in English that were presented as the lyrics to the tune of an English children's song \"Apple Song.\" In the \"rhythm\" condition,they were read the same four lines with rhythm and in the speech condition as regular speech.The text was presented six times and subjects were asked to recall the text four times: after Trials three,five,and six,and 15 minutes after Trial six. Results showed that(1) subjects with formal music training outperformed those with minimal music training,(2) materials were retained better when presented in musical forms(song or rhythm) than when presented as regular speech,and(3) the effects of music training and presentation mode showed a significant interaction,indicating that music training facilitated verbal memory mainly under the \"song\" condition. These results extended previous research by replicating the association between music training and verbal memory among children and with second-language materials.Moreover,the present study specified that the music training's facilitation effect was most prominent when the materials were presented as song lyrics.These results should provide useful information for teachers and developers of teaching materials.",

In this work, we analyse thoroughly the standard learning objective functions for multi-class classification CNNs: softmax regression (SR) for single-label scenario and logistic regression (LR) for multi-label scenario. Our analyses lead to an inspiration of exploiting LR for single-label classification learning, and then the disclosing of the negative class distraction problem in LR. To address this problem, we develop two novel LR based objective functions that not only generalise the conventional LR but importantly turn out to be competitive alternatives to SR in single label classification. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate the model learning advantages of the proposed LR functions over the commonly adopted SR in single-label coarse-grained object categorisation and cross-class fine-grained person instance identification tasks. We also show the performance superiority of our method on clothing attribute classification in comparison to the vanilla LR function.",

In this study, we examined vowel-plus-tone identification in quiet and noise conditions among Mandarin-speaking amusics with and without speech tone difficulties (tone agnosics and pure amusics, respectively), and IQ- and age-matched controls. Overall, pure amusics showed vowel and tone identification comparable to the controls in both quiet and noise conditions. Compared to pure amusics and controls, tone agnosics showed deficits in tone perception in both quiet and noise conditions. More importantly, their vowel perception was lower than pure amusics and controls in noise conditions, e.g., at a signal-to-noise ratio of -4 dB, although they showed normal-like performance in quiet and at a signal-to-noise ratio of -8 dB. These results suggest that when amusia affected speech tone processing (e.g., tone agnosics), it could also compromise vowel processing in noise. However, amusia alone does not affect tone or vowel perception in Mandarin Chinese either in quiet or in noise. Overall, the current study highlights the necessity of taking heterogeneity within the amusic group into account when considering the related speech deficits in this group.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To investigate the effect of cobalt chloride (CoCl 2) on serum & glucose deprivation (SGD)-induced injury and explore the role of HSP90 in the protection of CoCl 2 in H9c2 cells. Methods: H9c2 cells were subjected to SGD to establish a cellular model of cardiac ischemia. CoCl 2 was co-administered with SGD. 17-AAG (a selective HSP90 inhibitor) was administered before exposure of cells to CoCl 2 and SGD. Cell viability, HSP90 expression, intercellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) were observed. Results: H9c2 cells exposure to SGD induced insults, including decreased cell viability, increased ROS level and a ΔΨm loss. SGD exposure downregulated the expression of HSP90 in H9c2 cells. At concentrations ranging from 50 to 100 μmol·L -1, treatment with CoCl 2 antagonized SGD-induced decrease in cell viability. CoCl 2 (100 μmol·L -1) treatment also attenuated ROS accumulation and ΔΨm loss caused by SGD. Furthermore, exposure of H9c2 cells to 100 μmol·L -1 CoCl 2 upregulated HSP90 expression in a time-dependent manner. At concentrations from 50 to 200 μmol·L -1, treatment with CoCl 2 attenuated the downregulation of HSP90 induced by SGD, among which 100 μmol·L -1 CoCl 2 was the most effective. Inhibition of HSP90 by 17-AAG abrogated CoCl 2-induced cardioprotection in H9c2 cells. Conclusion: CoCl 2 protects H9c2 cells against SGD-induced insults partially by upregulation of HSP90 expression.",

        "abstract": "Risky decision making is a complex process that involves weighing the probabilities of alternative options that can be desirable, undesirable, or neutral. Individuals vary greatly in how they make decisions either under ambiguity and/or under risk. Such individual differences may have genetic bases. Based on previous studies on the genetic basis of decision making, two decision making tasks [i.e., the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and Loss Aversion Task (LAT)] were used to test the effect of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on decision making under ambiguity and under risk in a large Han Chinese sample (572 college students, 312 females). Basic intelligence and memory tests were also included to control for the influence of basic cognitive abilities on decision making. We found that 5-HTTLPR polymorphism significantly influenced performance in both IGT and LAT. After controlling for intelligence and memory abilities, subjects homozygous for s allele had lower IGT scores than l carriers in the first 40 trials of the IGT task. They also exhibited higher loss aversion than l carriers in the LAT task. Moreover, the effects of 5-HTTLPR were stronger for males than for females. These results extend the literature on the important role of emotion in decision making under ambiguity and risk, and shed additional lights on how decision making is influenced by culture as well as sex differences. Combining our results with existing literature, we propose that these effects might be mediated by a neural circuitry that comprises the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and insular cortex. Understanding the genetic factors affecting decision making in healthy subjects may allow us to better identify at-risk individuals, and better target the development of new potential treatments for specific disorders such as schizophrenia, addiction, and depression.",

        "abstract": "Despite their potential in various biomedical applications, photocrosslinkable hyaluronate hydrogels have often been limited by weak formation and unsatisfied mechanical strength which can be attributed to insufficient substitution of photoactive groups on the hyaluronate backbone and the oxygen inhibition effect. In this study, a new approach for the production of hyaluronic acid (MHA) with high acrylate group substitution (i.e. 2.27) is developed. It is based on the reaction of sodium hyaluronate and maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, which has never been reported previously. Furthermore, the thiol-acrylate photopolymerization approach is employed to prepare maleiated hyaluronic acid/thiol-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (MHA/TPEG) hydrogels which can overcome the oxygen inhibition effect. And the hydrogels possess porous structures, high swelling ratio, and tunable degradation rate. Specifically, the hydrogels could gel quickly within 15 s and demonstrate improved stiff (G' = 4100 Pa). The in vitro cytotoxic evaluation demonstrates that the hydrogels are cytocompatible to L929 cells. As a result, the in-situ formable hydrogel scaffolds exhibit great potential for medical applications.",

        "abstract": "Background Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable polygenic disorder. Recent enrichment analyses suggest that there may be true risk variants for bipolar disorder in the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in the brain.Aims We sought to assess the impact of eQTL variants on bipolar disorder risk by combining data from both bipolar disorder genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and brain eQTL.Method To detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence expression levels of genes associated with bipolar disorder, we jointly analysed data from a bipolar disorder GWAS (7481 cases and 9250 controls) and a genome-wide brain (cortical) eQTL (193 healthy controls) using a Bayesian statistical method, with independent follow-up replications. The identified risk SNP was then further tested for association with hippocampal volume ( n = 5775) and cognitive performance ( n = 342) among healthy individuals.Results Integrative analysis revealed a significant association between a brain eQTL rs6088662 on chromosome 20q11.22 and bipolar disorder (log Bayes factor = 5.48; bipolar disorder P = 5.85×10−5). Follow-up studies across multiple independent samples confirmed the association of the risk SNP (rs6088662) with gene expression and bipolar disorder susceptibility ( P = 3.54×10−8). Further exploratory analysis revealed that rs6088662 is also associated with hippocampal volume and cognitive performance in healthy individuals.Conclusions Our findings suggest that 20q11.22 is likely a risk region for bipolar disorder; they also highlight the informative value of integrating functional annotation of genetic variants for gene expression in advancing our understanding of the biological basis underlying complex disorders, such as bipolar disorder.",

        "abstract": "Aim To investigate whether the downregulation of heat shock protein 90(HSP90) was involved in cardiac cell injury induced by serum-glucose deprivation(SGD). Methods H9c2 cardiomyocytes(H9c2 cells) were treated with SGD to establish an in vitro model of ischemic cardiac cell injury.H9c2 cells were pretreated with 17-AAG(a selective inhibitor of HSP90) for 60 min before exposure of cells to SGD.Cell viability was detected by CCK-8.The intracellular level of free calcium was measured by Fluo-3AM staining and photofluorography.The expressions of HSP90 and glucose-regulated protein 78(GPR78) were tested by Western blot assay. Results Treatment of H9c2 cells with SGD for 24 h significantly induced downregulation of HSP90 expression,overload of intracellular calcium,and upregulation of GRP78 expression,which is a marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress.Pretreatment with 17-AAG,a selective HSP90 inhibitor,not only aggravated SGD-induced decrease in the viability of H9c2 cells,but also enhanced SGD-induced overload of intracellular calcium and upregulation of GRP78 expression in H9c2 cells. Conclusion Inhibition of HSP90 may be one of the key mechanisms,by which H9c2 cells were damaged by SGD.",

        "abstract": "Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins play key roles in plant drought tolerance. In this study, 157, 85 and 89 candidate LEA2 proteins were identified in  G. hirsutum ,  G. arboreum  and  G. raimondii  respectively.  LEA2  genes were classified into 6 groups, designated as group 1 to 6. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed orthologous gene pairs within the cotton genome. The cotton specific LEA2 motifs identified were E, R and D in addition to Y, K and S motifs. The genes were distributed on all chromosomes. LEA2s were found to be highly enriched in non-polar, aliphatic amino acid residues, with leucine being the highest, 9.1% in proportion. The miRNA, ghr-miR827a/b/c/d and ghr-miR164 targeted many genes are known to be drought stress responsive. Various stress-responsive regulatory elements, ABA-responsive element (ABRE), Drought-responsive Element (DRE/CRT), MYBS and low-temperature-responsive element (LTRE) were detected. Most genes were highly expressed in leaves and roots, being the primary organs greatly affected by water deficit. The expression levels were much higher in  G. tomentosum  as opposed to  G. hirsutum . The tolerant genotype had higher capacity to induce more of  LEA2  genes. Over expression of the transformed gene  Cot_AD24498  showed that the  LEA2  genes are involved in promoting root growth and in turn confers drought stress tolerance. We therefore infer that  Cot_AD24498 ,  CotAD_20020 ,  CotAD_21924  and  CotAD_59405  could be the candidate genes with profound functions under drought stress in upland cotton among the  LEA2  genes. The transformed  Arabidopsis  plants showed higher tolerance levels to drought stress compared to the wild types. There was significant increase in antioxidants, catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) accumulation, increased root length and significant reduction in oxidants, Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in the leaves of transformed lines under drought stress condition. This study provides comprehensive analysis of LEA2 proteins in cotton thus forms primary foundation for breeders to utilize these genes in developing drought tolerant genotypes.",

        "abstract": "Als Technologie zur elektrochemischen Energiespeicherung mit der hochsten theoretischen Kapazitat sind Lithium-Sauerstoff-Batterien mit grosen Herausforderungen im Hinblick auf die schlechte Stabilitat und den geringen Round-Trip-Wirkungsgrad beim Laden/Entladen verbunden. Es ist allgemein anerkannt, dass diese Probleme mit den parasitaren chemischen Reaktionen an der Anode, im Elektrolyten und an der Kathode in Zusammenhang stehen. Wahrend die detaillierten Mechanismen dieser Reaktionen gesondert untersucht wurden, sind die moglichen synergistischen Effekte zwischen ihnen immer noch schlecht verstanden. Um diese Wissenslucke zu schliesen, behandelt dieser Kurzaufsatz Literaturberichte zu den parasitaren chemischen Reaktionen und stellt als entscheidenden chemischen Vermittler die reaktiven Sauerstoffspezies heraus, die an fast allen parasitaren chemischen Reaktionen beteiligt sind oder diese fordern. In Anbetracht des ubiquitaren Vorkommens von Sauerstoff in allen Testzellen ist diese Erkenntnis von groser Wichtigkeit. Sie liefert neue Einblicke dazu, wie verschiedene Komponenten von Lithium-Sauerstoff-Batterien fur den Hochleistungsbetrieb stabilisiert werden konnen und wie das Potenzial dieser aussichtsreichen Technologie voll ausgeschopft werden kann.",

        "abstract": "A meta-analysis has suggested that vitamin D deficiency is involved in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and the levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are also decreased in type 2 diabetes. The injection of vitamin D induces cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) expression and H2S generation. However, it remains unclear whether the supplementation of vitamin D prevents DPN through improvement of CBS/H2S expression. In the present study, RSC96 cells, a rat Schwann cell line, were exposed to high glucose and methylglyoxal (HG&MG) to simulate diabetic peripheral nerve injury in vivo. Before the exposure to HG&MG, the cells were preconditioned with calcitriol (CCT), an active form of vitamin D, and then CCT-mediated neuroprotection was investigated in respect of cellular viability, superoxide anion (O2(-)) generation, inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS)/NO expression, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), as well as CBS expression and activity. It was found that both high glucose and MGO decreased cell viability and co-treatment with the two induced a more serious injury in RSC96 cells. Therefore, the exposure to HG&MG was used in the present study. The exposure to HG&MG markedly induced iNOS expression, NO and O2(-) generation, as well as MMP loss. In addition, the exposure to HG&MG depressed CBS expression and activity in RSC96 cells. However, the preconditioning with CCT significantly antagonized HG&MG-induced cell injury including the decreased viability, iNOS overexpression, NO and O2(-) accumulation, as well as MMP loss. CCT also partially restored the decreased CBS expression and activity triggered by HG&MG, while the inhibition of CBS with hydroxylamine attenuated CCT-mediated neuroprotection. Moreover, the exogenous donation of H2S produced similar cellular protective effects to CCT. The data indicate that the supplementation of vitamin D prevents HG&MG-induced peripheral nerve injury involving the restoration of endogenous H2S system, which may provide a basal support for the treatment of DPN with vitamin D clinically.",

        "abstract": "Cotton production is on the decline due to ever-changing environmental conditions. Drought and salinity stress contribute to over 30% of total loss in cotton production, the situation has worsened more due to the narrow genetic base of the cultivated upland cotton. The genetic diversity of upland cotton has been eroded over the years due to intense selection and inbreeding. To break the bottleneck, the wild cotton progenitors offer unique traits which can be introgressed into the cultivated cotton, thereby improving their performance. In this research, we developed a BC2F2 population between wild male parent, G. tomentosum as the donor, known for its high tolerance to drought and the elite female parent, G. hirsutum as the recurrent parent, which is high yielding but sensitive to drought stress. The population was genotyped through the genotyping by sequencing (GBS) method, in which 10,888 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) s were generated and used to construct a genetic map. The map spanned 4191.3 cM, with average marker distance of 0.3849 cM. The map size of the two sub genomes had a narrow range, 2149 cM and 2042.3 cM for At and Dt_sub genomes respectively. A total of 66,434 genes were mined, with 32,032 (48.2%) and 34,402 (51.8%) genes being obtained within the At and Dt_sub genomes respectively. Pkinase (PF00069) was found to be the dominant domain, with 1069 genes. Analysis of the main sub family, serine threonine protein kinases through gene ontology (GO), cis element and miRNA targets analysis revealed that most of the genes were involved in various functions aimed at enhancing abiotic stress tolerance. Further analysis of the RNA sequence data and qRT-PCR validation revealed 16 putative genes, which were highly up regulated under drought stress condition, and were found to be targeted by ghr-miR169a and ghr-miR164, previously associated with NAC(NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) and myeloblastosis (MYB), the top rank drought stress tolerance genes. These genes can be exploited further to aid in development of more drought tolerant cotton genotypes.",

        "abstract": "AIM:To investigate the effect of oxymatrine(OM) on intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction in rats with severe acute pancreatitis(SAP) and to analyze possible mechanisms involved.METHODS:A rat model of SAP was established by peritoneal injection of 175 mg/100 g L-arginine.Eighty healthy male Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups:control group,OM control group,SAP control group,OM treatment group(1-,12-,24-,36-,and 48-h subgroups).After treatment,plasma endotoxin and D-lactic acid levels were determined,the expression of claudin-1 mRNA in the tunica mucosa coli was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction(real time-PCR),and the activity of claudin-1 was determined by Western blotting.RESULTS:There were no significant differences in plasma levels of endotoxin and D-lactic acid and expression levels of claudin-1 mRNA and protein in the tunica mucosa coli between the control group and OM control group.Compared with the control group,plasma endotoxin and D-lactic acid levels were markedly increased,and the expression levels of claudin-1 mRNA and protein in the tunica mucosa coli were significantly decreased in the SAP control group(0.61 EU/mL ± 0.01 EU/mL vs 0.05 EU/mL ± 0.02 EU/mL;8.38 mg/L ± 0.38 mg/L vs 2.87 mg/L ± 0.50 mg/L,both P < 0.01).Compared with the SAP control group,the expression levels of claudin-1 mRNA and protein in the tunica mucosa coli were significantly increased and plasma levels of endotoxin and D-lactic acid were markedly decreased in the OM treatment group(0.09 EU/mL ± 0.02 EU/mL vs 0.61 EU/mL ± 0.01 EU/mL;2.94 mg/L ± 0.42 mg/L vs 8.38 mg/L ± 0.38 mg/L,both P < 0.01).CONCLUSION:Plasma levels of endotoxin and D-lactic acid were markedly increased and expression levels of claudin-1 mRNA and protein in tunica mucosa coli were significantly decreased in SAP rats.OM intervention can markedly decrease plasma levels of endotoxin and D-lactic acid,increase claudin-1 mRNA and protein expression levels,and improve mucosal barrier dysfunction to prevent bacterial translocation in SAP rats.",

The results from 189 first,second and fifth graders indicated that:1) there were significant differences among three grades on English onset and rime awareness. Significant differences were also found between the students at the fifth grade and those at the other two grades but not between the first and second graders on phoneme awareness. 2) Phonological awareness was correlated to reading and spelling significantly in all three grades. 3) After controlling for English oral vocabulary,onset awareness predicted first graders’ reading and spelling and second graders’ spelling significantly,whereas it was phoneme awareness that predicted fifth graders’ reading and spelling significantly. English phonological awareness significantly accounted for more variances of reading than spelling in all three grades. The study revealed the importance of English phonological awareness in children's reading and spelling,particularly in their spelling. Onset awareness plays a more important role in children's early English literacy development,whereas phoneme awareness may be more crucial in their later learning.",

In accordance with the multiple-timescale features, RLV attitude dynamics are divided into an outer-loop subsystem and an inner-loop subsystem. Based on the recently developed sliding mode control (SMC), a novel multivariable supertwisting sliding mode controller driven by a FDO is designed to achieve a fast and accurate reentry attitude tracking. This integrated design can generate a continuous control law which has excellent robustness to uncertainty and disturbances with known bounds while achieving an arbitrarily fast convergence. The finite-time stability of the overall system is proved by using the Lyapunov function technique and the multiple-timescale separation principle. In addition, an optimal control allocation for allocating torque commands into aerodynamic surface deflection commands with constraints is also proposed. Finally, the effectiveness an...",

        "abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met (rs4680) polymorphism plays a crucial role in regulating brain dopamine level. Converging evidence from Caucasian samples showed that, compared with rs4680 Val allele, the Met allele was linked to lower COMT activity, which in turn was linked to better cognitive performance such as working memory (WM) and to a larger hippocampus (a brain region important for WM). However, some behavioral studies have shown that the function of rs4680 appears to vary across different ethnic groups, with Chinese subjects showing an opposite pattern as that for Caucasians (i.e. the Val allele is linked to better cognitive functions related to WM in Chinese). Using a sample of healthy Han Chinese college students (ages from 19 to 21 years), this study investigated the association of COMT Val158Met genotype with behavioral data on a two-back WM task (n = 443, 189M/254F) and T1 MRI data (n = 320, 134M/186F). Results showed that, compared to the Met allele, the Val allele was associated with larger hippocampal volume (the right hippocampus: β = -0.118, t = -2.367, P = 0.019, and the left hippocampus: β = -0.099, t = -1.949, P = 0.052) and better WM performance (β = -0.110, t = -2.315, P = 0.021). These results add to the growing literature on differentiated effects of COMT rs4680 polymorphism on WM across populations and offer a brain structural mechanism for such population-specific genetic effects.",

        "abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genes have been found to interactively influence working memory (WM) as well as brain activation during WM tasks. However, whether the two genes have interactive effects on resting-state activities of the brain and whether these spontaneous activations correlate with WM are still unknown. This study included behavioral data from WM tasks and genetic data (COMT rs4680 and BDNF Val66Met) from 417 healthy Chinese adults and resting-state fMRI data from 298 of them. Significant interactive effects of BDNF and COMT were found for WM performance as well as for resting-state regional homogeneity (ReHo) in WM-related brain areas, including the left medial frontal gyrus (lMeFG), left superior frontal gyrus (lSFG), right superior and medial frontal gyrus (rSMFG), right medial orbitofrontal gyrus (rMOFG), right middle frontal gyrus (rMFG), precuneus, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus and right inferior parietal lobule. Simple effects analyses showed that compared to other genotypes, subjects with COMT-VV/BDNF-VV had higher WM and lower ReHo in all five frontal brain areas. The results supported the hypothesis that COMT and BDNF polymorphisms influence WM performance and spontaneous brain activity (i.e., ReHo).",

        "abstract": "Delayed wound healing is a common skin complication of diabetes, which is associated with keratinocyte injury and dysfunction. Levels of methylglyoxal (MGO), an α-dicarbonyl compound, are elevated in diabetic skin tissue and plasma, while levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a critical gaseous signaling molecule, are reduced. Interestingly, the gas has shown dermal protection in our previous study. To date, there is no evidence demonstrating whether MGO affects keratinocyte viability and function or H2S donation abolishes these effects and improves MGO-related impairment of wound healing. The current study was conducted to examine the effects of MGO on the injury and function in human skin keratinocytes and then to evaluate the protective action of a novel H2S-releasing molecule.An N-mercapto-based H2S donor (NSHD)-1 was synthesized and its ability to release H2S was observed in cell medium and cells, respectively. HaCaT cells, a cell line of human skin keratinocyte, were exposed to MGO to establish an in vitro diabetic wound healing model. NSHD-1 was added to the cells before MGO exposure and the improvement of cell function was observed in respect of cellular viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and behavioral function.Treatment with MGO decreased cell viability, induced cellular apoptosis, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and depressed MMP in HaCaT cells. The treatment also damaged cell behavioral function, characterized by decreased cellular adhesion and migration. The synthesized H2S-releasing molecule, NSHD-1, was able to increase H2S levels in both cell medium and cells. Importantly, pretreatment with NSHD-1 inhibited MGO-induced decreases in cell viability and MMP, increases in apoptosis and ROS accumulation in HaCaT cells. The pretreatment was also able to improve adhesion and migration function.These results demonstrate that the novel synthesized H2S donor is able to protect human skin keratinocytes against MGO-induced injury and behavior dysfunction. We believe that more reasonable H2S-releasing molecules will bring relief to patients suffering from delayed wound healing in diabetes mellitus in the future.",

We found that 11 SNPs within the HTR2A gene were associated with true memory (p=0.000076-0.043). The associations between true memory and seven adjacent SNPs (i.e., rs1923888, rs1745837, rs9567739, rs3742279, rs655888, rs655854, and rs2296972) were still significant after multiple testing corrections. Haplotype-based association analysis revealed that, true memory was positively associated with haplotype A-C-C-G-C-T-A for these seven adjacent SNPs (p=0.000075), which was still significant after multiple testing correction. Only one SNP rs655854 was associated with false memory (p=0.023), and it was not significant after multiple testing correction. This study replicates, in an Asian population, that genetic variation in HTR2A is associated with episodic memory, and also suggests that this association is restricted to true memory.",

        "abstract": "This study was aimed to establish a stable animal model of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to provide theoretical and experimental basis for understanding the development of LVH. The abdominal aorta of male Wistar rats (80-100 g) was constricted to a diameter of 0.55 mm between the branches of the celiac and anterior mesenteric arteries. Echocardiography using a linear phased array probe was performed as well as pathological examination and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurement at 3, 4 and 6 weeks after abdominal aortic constriction (AAC). The results showed that the acute mortality rate (within 24 h) of this modified rat model was 8%. Animals who underwent AAC demonstrated significantly increased interventricular septal (IVS), LV posterior wall (LVPWd), LV mass index (LVMI), cross-sectional area (CSA) of myocytes, and perivascular fibrosis; the ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), and cardiac output (CO) were consistently lower at each time point after AAC. Notably, differences in these parameters between AAC group and sham group were significant by 3 weeks and reached peaks at 4th week. Following AAC, the plasma BNP was gradually elevated compared with the sham group at 3rd and 6th week. It was concluded that this modified AAC model can develop LVH, both stably and safely, by week four post-surgery; echocardiography is able to assess changes in chamber dimensions and systolic properties accurately in rats with LVH.",

Firstly, the simulated results were compared with the experimental data of IM600/133 composites to determine the feasibility of the models. The results affirmed that lightning in-plane damage evaluated by temperature dependent model had a good agreement with experimental results while the lightning in-depth damage evaluated by pyrolysis dependent model matched well with experimental results. Then the proposed models and methods were confirmed by the simulation of the lightning strike damage of TR50S15L/YPH-308 laminates and the comparison between the simulated and experimental results. The appropriate models and methods to evaluate lightning in-plane and in-depth damages are helpful for the research of lightning damage behaviors, mechanisms and anti-lightning optimizations of CFRP.",

        "abstract": " rs1344706 (A/C) was the first SNP that reached genome-wide significance for schizophrenia. Recent studies have linked rs1344706 to functional connectivity among specific brain regions. However, no study thus far has examined the role of this SNP in the entire functional connectome. In this study, we used degree centrality to test the role of rs1344706 in the whole-brain voxel-wise functional connectome during the resting state. 52 schizophrenia patients and 128 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. In our whole-brain analysis, we found a significant interaction effect of genotype × diagnosis at the precuneus (PCU) (cluster size = 52 voxels, peak voxel MNI coordinates: x = 9, y = - 69, z = 63,  = 32.57, FWE corrected  < 0.001). When we subdivided the degree centrality network according to anatomical distance, the whole-brain analysis also found a significant interaction effect of genotype × diagnosis at the PCU with the same peak in the short-range degree centrality network (cluster size = 72 voxels,  = 37.29, FWE corrected  < 0.001). No significant result was found in the long-range degree centrality network. Our results elucidated the contribution of rs1344706 to functional connectivity within the brain network, and may have important implications for our understanding of this risk gene's role in functional dysconnectivity in schizophrenia.",

The current study investigated whether RSFC within the reading network was correlated with Chinese adults' reading abilities in their native language (L1, Chinese) and second language (L2, English). Results showed that RSFC within the reading network was positively correlated to reading abilities in L1 and L2, and RSFC between reading areas and the default network was negatively correlated to reading abilities in L1 and L2. Further conjunction and contrast analyses revealed that L1 and L2 shared similar RSFC correlates including connectivities between the areas for visual analysis (e.g., bilateral posterior fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortices, and right superior parietal lobules) and those for phonological processing (e.g., bilateral precentral gyri and postcentral gyrus, Wernicke's area). These results indicate that RSFC is a potential neural marker for reading abilities in both L1 and L2, with important theoretical implications for reading in L1 and L2.",

The evolution of strain and stress of composite laminates during cure was numerically simulated using the validated model. Also, fiber Bragg grating temperature and strain sensors were adjacently embedded in the composite laminate to in situ monitor the temperature and strain evolution. The monitored strain was evaluated by comparison with the corresponding simulated strain. The results reveal that the monitored temperature can reflect the actual temperature evolution in composite laminates, whereas the monitored strain cannot accurately characterize the actual strain evolution in composite laminates at the early stage of cure. However, when the resin/grating interfacial bond strength increases enough to transfer resin strain effectively, the changes in the monitored strain can match well with the actual strain changes.",

Twenty undergraduates judged whether a number matched or did not match another number presented 1.5 s earlier. Compared with number pairs with a 'small' numerical distance (distance=1), number pairs with a 'large' numerical distance (greater than 2) showed a longer latency and a greater positive amplitude in the N240 component. This numerical distance effect was limited to fronto-central electrodes. These results were discussed in terms of the neural bases of the numerical distance effect during the automatic processing of numbers.",

Using an improved number Stroop paradigm (i.e., systematically manipulating physical size distance), in the present study we tested the predictions of the two models for number magnitude processing. The results supported the single-representation model and, more importantly, explained how a design problem (failure to manipulate physical size distance) and an analytical problem (failure to consider the interaction between congruity and task-irrelevant numerical distance) might have contributed to the evidence used to support the two-representation model. This study, therefore, can help settle the debate between the single-representation and two-representation models.",

        "abstract": "The performance of a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system is highly dependent on the charge separation, transport and transfer characteristics at the photoelectrode|electrolyte interface. Of the factors that influence the charge behaviors, the crystalline facets of the semiconductor in contact with the electrolyte play an important role but has been poorly studied previously. Here, we present a study aimed at understanding how the different facets of hematite affect the charge separation and transfer behaviors in a solar water oxidation reaction. Specifically, hematite crystallites with predominantly {012} and {001} facets exposed were synthesized. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that hematite {012} surfaces feature higher OH coverage, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These surface OH groups act as active sites to mediate water oxidation reactions, which plays a positive role for the PEC system. These surface OH groups also facilitate charge recombination, which compromises the charge separation capabilities of hematite. Indeed, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) confirmed that hematite {012} surfaces exhibit higher rate constants for both charge transfer and recombination. Open circuit potential (OCP) measurements revealed that the hematite {012} surface exhibits a greater degree of Fermi level pinning effect. Our results shed light on how different surface crystal structures may change surface kinetics and energetics. The information is expected to contribute to efforts on optimizing PEC performance for practical solar fuel synthesis.",

        "abstract": "Previous research has shown inconsistent findings regarding the relations between the functional Val158Met polymorphisms of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and individual differences in personality traits. This study attempts to overcome some of the weaknesses of previous research, namely, small sample sizes, clinical samples, ethnic stratification, wide age ranges, neglecting sex differences, and single measures of personality traits. A large sample (n = 556, 250 male, 306 female) of healthy Chinese college students (mean age = 20.5 ± 1 years) was given a battery of personality scales, including the temperament and character inventory-revised, the behavioral inhibition system and behavioral approach system scale, the Beck depression inventory, and the Beck anxiety inventory. Factor analysis of the affect-related personality traits revealed two factors that corresponded to positive (PEM) and negative emotionality (NEM). We found a consistent COMT-by-sex interaction effect on affect-related personality traits. Compared with males with Met/Met alleles, males with Val/Val alleles showed significantly higher scores on NEM, but lower scores on PEM. Females, however, showed an opposite but nonsignificant pattern. Our results supported the role of the COMT gene in personality traits for males and contributed to the growing literature on sex differences in gene-behavior connections.",

Social and cognitive mechanisms involved in cooperation (e.g., motivation, reward encoding, action evaluation, and executive functions) are sub-served by the striatal-projected circuits, whose physical existence has been confirmed by animal studies, human postmortem studies, and in vivo human brain studies. The current study investigated the associations between Cooperativeness and fiber connectivities from the striatum to nine subcortical and cortical regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, medial orbitofrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/retrosplenial cortex, dorsal cingulate cortex, and rostral cingulate cortex. Results showed that Cooperativeness was negatively correlated with fiber connectivity for the cognitive control system (from the dorsal caudate to the rostral cingulate cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex), but not with fiber connectivity for the social cognitive system (e.g., connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala). These results partially supported Declerck et al.'s (2013) cognitive neural model of the role of cognitive control and social cognition in cooperation.",

Given the important role of the hippocampus in spatial processing, the present study investigated whether structural differences in the hippocampus could explain the sex difference in 3D mental rotation. Results showed that after controlling for brain size, males had a larger anterior hippocampus, whereas females had a larger posterior hippocampus. Gray matter volume (GMV) of the right anterior hippocampus was significantly correlated with 3D mental rotation score. After controlling GMV of the right anterior hippocampus, sex difference in 3D mental rotation was no longer significant. These results suggest that the structural difference between males' and females' right anterior hippocampus was a neurobiological substrate for the sex difference in 3D mental rotation.",

        "abstract": "Nanostructured catalysts often face an important challenge: poor stability. Many factors contribute to catalytic degradation, including parasitic chemical reactions, phase separation, agglomeration, and dissolution, leading to activity loss especially during long-term catalytic reactions. This challenge is shared by a new family of catalysts, multimetallic nanoparticles, which have emerged owing to their broad tunability and high activity. While significant synthesis-based advances have been made, the stability of these nanostructured catalysts, especially during catalytic reactions, has not been well addressed. In this study, we reveal the critical influence of a synthetic method on the stability of nanostructured catalysts through aprotic oxygen catalysis (Li-O battery) demonstrations. In comparison to the conventional wet impregnation (WI) method, we show that the carbothermal shock (CTS) method dramatically improves the overall structural and chemical stability of the catalyst with the same elemental compositions. For multimetallic compositions (4- and 8-elements), the overall stability of the electrocatalysts as well as the battery lifetime can be further improved by incorporating additional noncatalytically active elements into the individual nanoparticles via CTS. The results offer a new synthetic path toward the stabilization of nanostructured catalysts, where additional reaction schemes beyond oxygen electrocatalysis are foreseeable.",

The results from 17 papers on numerical processing were re-analyzed.The dorsolateral(PMd) and ventrolateral premotor areas(PMv) were found to be significantly activated in most studies,while few involved SMA.Number comparison,addition and subtraction caused more activation in PMd,and multiplication caused more in PMv.The rostral parts of PMd,PMv and SMA were significantly modulated by numerical properties.This suggests a role of the premotor cortex not limited to motor reaction during numerical processing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   By using standardized Waveforms C and D, this study explored the lightning strike protection (LSP) effectiveness of nickel coated carbon fiber nonwoven veils (Ni-CFNVs) on protecting the carbon fiber composite structures in Zone 2 (aircraft lightning zoning). The post-lightning damage was evaluated by visual inspection, ultrasonic scan and residual strength test. Results showed that the Ni-CFNV of 70 g/m 2  eliminated lightning strike damage inflicted by both waveforms and it even performed better than the commercial expanded copper foil of 73 g/m 2 . Therefore, the Ni-CFNV will be a promising alternative to metal mesh for eliminating lightning strike damage to the structures in Zone 2. The remarkable LSP effectiveness of Ni-CFNV can be explained by its integration of high electrical conductivity of Ni-coating and prominent ablation resistance of carbon fiber. The experiments indicate that not only the electrical conductivity, but also the ablation resistance of LSP layer greatly influences the LSP effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "To explore whether the facilitation effects of an explicit instruction to “be creative”  vary across cultures and types of tasks, 248 U.S. and 278 Chinese college students  were administered a battery of tests of verbal, artistic, and mathematical creativity.  Half of the participants were tested under the standard condition, and the other half  under the explicit instruction condition. Results showed that the facilitation effects  of the explicit instruction varied by domains of the creativity tasks (greater for  artistic and mathematical creativity than for verbal creativity), but not across cultural  and ethnic groups. The explicit instruction had a small “detrimental” effect on the  clarity and grammar of story writing, but not on any other aspects of the technical  quality of creative products. Methodological and theoretical implications of these  findings are discussed.  ",

        "abstract": "CACNA1C gene polymorphism rs2007044 has been reported to be associated with schizophrenia, but its underlying brain mechanism is not clear. First, we conducted an exploratory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using an N-BACK task and a Stroop task in 194 subjects (55 schizophrenia patients and 139 healthy controls). Our whole brain analysis found that the risk allele was associated with reduced activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during the Stroop task (cluster size = 390 voxels, P < 0.05 TFCE-FWE corrected; peak MNI coordinates: x = -57, y = -6, z = 30). We also conducted a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study using the same Stroop task in an independent sample of 126 healthy controls to validate the fMRI finding. Our repeated-measures ANCOVA on the six channels (20, 27, 33, 34, 40 and 46) within the left IFG also found significant result. The polymorphism rs2007044 showed significant effect on the oxy-Hb data (F = 5.072, P = 0.026) and showed significant interaction effect with channels on the deoxy-Hb data (F = 2.841, P = 0.015). Taken together, results of this study suggested that rs2007044 could affect the activation of the left IFG, which was a possible brain mechanism underlying the association between CACNA1C gene polymorphism and schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Despite numerous studies on the neural basis of numerical processing, few studies have examined the neural substrates of one of the most basic numerical processing-number sequence recitation. The present study used fMRI to investigate neural substrates of number sequence recitation, focusing on the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and perisylvian areas. This study used a 2 (number versus alphabet) x 2 (forward versus backward recitation) design. 12 Chinese undergraduates were asked to recite overtly but gently numerical and alphabetical sequences forward and backward. Results showed that, for both numerical and alphabetic sequences, the left IPS was activated when performing backward recitation, but not when performing forward recitation. In terms of perisylvian areas, all four tasks elicited activation in bilateral superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus, but forward recitation elicited greater activation in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus than did backward recitation, whereas backward recitation elicited greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus than did forward recitation. These results suggest that forward recitation of numbers and the alphabet is typically based on verbal processing of numbers implemented in the perisylvian area, whereas backward recitation would likely require additional neural resources in the IPS.",

        "abstract": "We identified 102, 51 and 51 proteins encoded by the trihelix genes in Gossypium hirsutum, G. arboreum and G. raimondii, respectively. RNA sequence data and RT-qPCR analysis showed that Gh_A05G2067 (GT-2) was highly upregulated under drought and salt stress conditions. Transient expression of GT-2-GFP fusion protein in protoplast showed that GT-2 was localized in the nucleus. The overexpression of GT-2 conferred an enhanced drought tolerance to cotton, with lower malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H O ) contents, and higher reactive oxygen scavenging enzyme activities. Moreover, chlorophyll content, relative leaf water content (RLWC), excised leaf water loss (ELWL) and cell membrane stability (CMS) were relatively stable in the GT-2-overexpressed lines compared to wild-type. Similarly, stress-responsive genes RD29A, SOS1, ABF4, and CBL1 were highly up-regulated in the GT-2-overexpressed lines but were significantly down-regulated in wild-type. In addition, the GT2-silenced cotton plants exhibited a high level of oxidation injury, due to high levels of oxidant enzymes, in addition to negative effects on CMS, ELWL, RLWC and chlorophyll content. These results mark the foundation for future exploration of the trihelix genes in cotton, with an aim of developing more resilient, versatile and highly tolerant cotton genotypes.

        "abstract": "Using unfamiliar and meaningless pictographs that varied in their degree of similarity to Chinese characters, the current study tested whether the early electrophysiological response was modulated by character likeness. We measured P100 and N170 while 20 native Chinese speakers were viewing Chinese characters, drawings of objects, and pictographs. Comparisons across the three categories of stimuli showed that pictographs elicited a smaller N170 amplitude than did Chinese characters and a stronger N170 amplitude than did objects, but did not differ in the P100 amplitude from the other two categories. Within the category of pictographs, stimuli with a higher degree of character likeness elicited larger N170 amplitudes and shorter N170 peak latencies, and this effect was again not observed in P100. These results suggest that N170 is sensitive to visual stimuli's character likeness even though they are unfamiliar pictographs with no meanings or sounds.",

Results indicated that males and females achieved equal learning outcome, and their learning curve followed a similar power function. They also showed similar overall activation in the fusiform cortex, a region that has been associated with visual word processing. Despite the absence of sex differences in averaged behavioral performance and neural activation, males and females were found to have different neural predictors of visual word learning. As predicted, left-lateralized fusiform activation predicted visual word learning for males, but not for females, whereas bilateral fusiform activation predicted visual word learning for females, but not males. These results suggest that male and female brains operate differently to achieve the best performance in visual word learning. The individual-differences approach adopted in the present study provides a new and useful perspective to sex differences.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The  CNTNAP2  (contactin-associated protein-like 2) gene, highly expressed in the human prefrontal cortex, has been linked with autism and language impairment. Potential relationships between  CNTNAP2 , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and cognition have been suggested by previous clinical studies, but have not been directly examined in the same study. The current study collected structural MRI, genetic, and behavioral data in 317 healthy Chinese adults, and examined associations between  CNTNAP2  variants, DLPFC, and cognitive performance (measured by the Stroop task). After controlling for intracranial volume, sex, and age, the  CNTNAP2  genetic polymorphism at SNP rs7809486 had the strongest association with bilateral DLPFC volume ( p  = 0.00015 and 0.00014 for left and right DLPFC volumes, respectively), with GG homozygotes having greater bilateral DLPFC volumes and surface areas than the other genotypes. Furthermore, TT homozygotes of  CNTNAP2  rs4726946 (a nearby SNP that had moderate linkage disequilibrium with rs7809486) had greater left DLPFC volume and surface area, and better cognitive performance than the other genotypes. Subjects with greater left DLPFC surface area had better cognitive performance. Importantly, the left DLPFC surface area mediated the association between the  CNTNAP2  rs4726946 genotype and cognitive performance. This study provides the first evidence for associations among the  CNTNAP2  gene, left DLPFC structure, and cognitive control.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between English vowel identification and English vowel formant discrimination for native Mandarin Chinese- and native English-speaking listeners. The identification of 12 English vowels was measured with the duration cue preserved or removed. The thresholds of vowel formant discrimination on the F2 of two English vowels,/Λ/and/i/, were also estimated using an adaptive-tracking procedure. Native Mandarin Chinese-speaking listeners showed significantly higher thresholds of vowel formant discrimination and lower identification scores than native English-speaking listeners. The duration effect on English vowel identification was similar between native Mandarin Chinese- and native English-speaking listeners. Moreover, regardless of listeners' language background, vowel identification was significantly correlated with vowel formant discrimination for the listeners who were less dependent on duration cues, whereas the correlation between vowel identification and vowel formant discrimination was not significant for the listeners who were highly dependent on duration cues. This study revealed individual variability in using multiple acoustic cues to identify English vowels for both native and non-native listeners.",

        "abstract": "To study the relationship between CT imaging classification criteria and the prognosis of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).From January 2000 to December 2009, 62 cases with SAP were analyzed, retrospectively. They were all executed CT examination in 72 h after admission, and their CT imaging were classified as grade C (n = 13), grade D (n = 26), and grade E (n = 23) according to the Balthazar classification criteria and also classified as grade I (n = 11), grade II (n = 39), grade III (n = 12) according to the Balthazar CT severity index (CTSI) criteria, respectively. The values of these two different classification criteria in assessing the prognosis of SAP were studied, such as length of hospital stay, fever days, fasting days, white blood cell recovery days, serum amylase recovery days, pancreatic pseudocyst, organ failure, need for transit operations, and death. By studying the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which were drawn by the area under cures, the values of the two different classification criteria were compared in assessing the prognosis of SAP.The Balthazar classification criteria was valuable in assessing white blood cell recovery days (F = 4.035, P = 0.023) and pseudocyst (χ(2) = 8.066, P = 0.018). No statistical differences were found, however, between other clinicopathological parameters and the prognosis of SAP, according to the Balthazar classification criteria. The patients with low-grade of CTSI classification criteria enjoyed better prognosis, and patients in grade I or II got lower incidence of organ failure, need for transit operations and pseudocyst than that in grade III. The results above suggested that CTSI classification criteria, comparing with Balthazar CT classification criteria, was more valuable in predicting the incidence of organ failure, pseudocyst, need for transit operation, and mortality in SAP (P < 0.01).The CTSI classification criteria has a great value in assessing the prognosis of SAP.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to investigate the influence of anticorrosion-used fiberglass isolation layer on the lightning strike protection (LSP) of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), the specimens, prepared by inserting a fiberglass layer between the expanded metal (Al or Cu) foil and CFRP substrate, were subjected to the artificial lightning of standardized Waveform C (200 Coulombs) and Waveform D (100 kA). The post-lightning damage was evaluated via visual inspection, ultrasonic scanning and residual strength test. The experiments found that the fiberglass isolation layer enhanced the LSP effectiveness of CFRP. While the majority of LSP solutions are based on the current “discharge” mechanism of highly conductive materials, the fiberglass isolation layer probably belongs to the “isolating” mechanism. The inherent electrically insulating, thermally insulating and refractory properties of fiberglass make it possible to construct an isolation layer that suppresses the downward penetration of lightning electric and heat into the underlying CFRP, preventing the CFRP from being ablated by internal Joule heat and external heat.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of advanced information technologies (IT), especially the wide spread of Internet of Things (IoTs) makes wireless spectrum a precious resource. Cognitive radio network (CRN) has been recognized as the key to achieve efficient utility of communication bands. Because of the great difficulty, high complexity and regulations in dynamic spectrum access (DSA), it is very challenging to protect CRNs from malicious attackers or selfish abusers. Primary user emulation (PUE) attacks is one type of easy-to-launch but hard-to-detect attacks in CRNs that malicious entities mimic PU signals in order to either occupy spectrum resource selfishly or conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Inspired by the physical features widely used as the fingerprint of variant electronic devices, an adaptive and realistic PUE attack detection technique is proposed in this paper. It leverages the PU transmission features that attackers are not able to mimic. In this work, the transmission power is selected as one of the hard-to-mimic features due to the intrinsic discrepancy between PUs and attackers, while considering constraints in real implementations. Our experimental results verified the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed mechanism.",

Recent research reveals possible phonological deficits among amusic individuals from non-tonal language speakers. In a tone language such as Mandarin, only a subgroup of amusic individuals showed speech tone deficits. In the present study, we examined whether a similar phonological deficit exists in Mandarin amusics and whether the phonological deficits are confined to the subgroup of amusics who showed speech tone deficits. An simple identification task targeted at either vowel, tone, or a combination of vowel and tone for 20 monosyllabic words was administered to three groups of Mandarin speakers: amusics with (tone agnosics) and without tone deficits (pure amusics), and matched controls. Tone agnosics lagged significantly behind both the pure amusics and controls when identifying tone and the combination of vowel and tone, but performed similarly to the latter two groups when identifying vowel. ...",

        "abstract": "As a promising high-capacity energy storage technology Li-O2 batteries face two critical challenges - poor cycle lifetime and low round-trip efficiencies, both of which are connected to the high overpotentials. The problem is particularly acute during recharge, where the reactions typically follow two-electron mechanisms that are inherently slow. Here we present a strategy that can significantly reduce recharge overpotentials. Our approach seeks to promote Li2O2 decomposition by one-electron processes, and the key is to stabilize the important intermediate of superoxide species. With the introduction of a highly polarizing electrolyte, we observe the recharge processes are successfully switched from a two-electron pathway to a single-electron one. While similar one-electron route has been reported for the discharge processes, it has rarely been described for recharge except for the initial stage due to the poor mobilities of surface bound superoxide ions (O2-), a necessary intermediate for the mechanism. Key to our observation is the solvation of O2- by an ionic liquid electrolyte (PYR14TFSI). Recharge overpotentials as low as 0.19 V at 100 mA/gcarbon are measured.",

        "abstract": "Model learning from class imbalanced training data is a long-standing and significant challenge for machine learning. In particular, existing deep learning methods consider mostly either class balanced data or moderately imbalanced data in model training, and ignore the challenge of learning from significantly imbalanced training data. To address this problem, we formulate a class imbalanced deep learning model based on batch-wise incremental minority (sparsely sampled) class rectification by hard sample mining in majority (frequently sampled) classes during model training. This model is designed to minimise the dominant effect of majority classes by discovering sparsely sampled boundaries of minority classes in an iterative batch-wise learning process. To that end, we introduce a Class Rectification Loss (CRL) function that can be deployed readily in deep network architectures. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on three imbalanced person attribute benchmark datasets (CelebA, X-Domain, DeepFashion) and one balanced object category benchmark dataset (CIFAR-100). These experimental results demonstrate the performance advantages and model scalability of the proposed batch-wise incremental minority class rectification model over the existing state-of-the-art models for addressing the problem of imbalanced data learning.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have identified the critical role of the left fusiform cortex in visual word form processing, learning, and memory. However, this so-called visual word form area's (VWFA) other functions are not clear. In this study, we used fMRI and the subsequent memory paradigm to examine whether the putative VWFA was involved in the processing and successful memory encoding of faces as well as words. Twenty-two native Chinese speakers were recruited to memorize the visual forms of faces and Chinese words. Episodic memory for the studied material was tested 3h after the scan with a recognition test. The fusiform face area (FFA) and the VWFA were functionally defined using separate localizer tasks. We found that, both within and across subjects, stronger activity in the VWFA was associated with better recognition memory of both words and faces. Furthermore, activation in the VWFA did not differ significantly during the encoding of faces and words. Our results revealed the important role of the so-called VWFA in face processing and memory and supported the view that the left mid-fusiform cortex plays a general role in the successful processing and memory of different types of visual objects (i.e., not limited to visual word forms).",

        "abstract": "The significant role of the left midfusiform cortex in reading found in recent neuroimaging studies has led to the visual word form area (VWFA) hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that years of experience reading native language change the visual expertise of this region to be especially sensitive to the visual form of native language. The present study aimed at testing this hypothesis by exploring the role of language experience in shaping the fusiform activation. We designed a logographic artificial language (LAL) using the visual form and pronunciation of Korean Hangul characters (but their correspondence was shuffled) and assigning arbitrary meanings to these characters. Twelve native Chinese Mandarin speakers (6 male and 6 female, 18 to 21 years old) with no prior knowledge of Korean language were trained in the visual form of these characters for 2 weeks, followed by 2 weeks each of phonological and semantic training. Behavioral data indicated that training was effective in increasing the efficiency of visual form processing and establishing the connections among visual form, sounds, and meanings. Imaging data indicated that at the pre-training stage, subjects showed stronger activation in the fusiform regions for LAL than for Chinese across both one-back visual matching task and the passive viewing task. Visual form training significantly decreased the activation of bilateral fusiform cortex and the left inferior occipital cortex, whereas phonological training increased activation in these regions, and the right fusiform remained more active after semantic training. Increased activations after phonological and semantic training were also evident in other regions involved in language processing. These findings thus do not seem to be consistent with the visual-expertise-induced-sensitivity hypothesis about fusiform regions. Instead, our results suggest that visual familiarity, phonological processing, and semantic processing all make significant but different contributions to shaping the fusiform activation.",

This study tested the hypothesis that culture and gender would interact to predict people's emotion responding (emotion intensity and regulatory strategies). Chinese (n=220; 52% female) and American undergraduates (n=241; 62% female) viewed photos intended to elicit negative emotions after receiving instructions to either \"just feel\" any emotions that arose (Just Feel), or to \"do something\" so that they would not experience any emotion while viewing the photos (Regulate). All participants then rated the intensity of their experienced emotions and described any emotion-regulation strategies that they used while viewing the photos. Consistent with predictions, culture and gender interacted with experimental condition to predict intensity: Chinese men reported relatively low levels of emotion, whereas American women reported relatively high levels of emotion. Disengagement strategies (especially distancing) were related to lower emotional intensity and were reported most often by Chinese men. Taken together, findings suggest that emotion-regulation strategies may contribute to differences in emotional experience across Western and East Asian cultures.",

The full-scale IQ score of the participants ranged from 57 to 144 (M = 100, SD = 14). The full IQ score had a negative correlation with false recognition in patients with schizophrenia, and positive correlations with high-confidence true recognition and discrimination rates. Further analyses with the subtests' scores revealed that false recognition was negatively correlated with scores of performance IQ (and one of its subtests: picture arrangement), whereas true recognition was positively correlated with scores of verbal IQ (and two of its subtests: information and digit span). High-IQ patients had less false recognition (overall or high-confidence false recognition), more high-confidence true recognition, and higher discrimination abilities than those with low IQ. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the cognitive mechanism in false memory of patients with schizophrenia, and are of practical relevance to the evaluation of memory reliability in patients with different intellectual levels.",

The study aims were to investigate the effects of vitamin D on patient survival, and the proliferation or survival of pancreatic cancer cell lines.The present study examined the local expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in pancreatic normal and tumour tissues from a cohort of 61 patients, and analysed the potential correlation between VDR and pathological characteristics, including disease prognosis. Among 61 pairs of normal and tumour specimens, VDR was detected in all normal tissues, and was abundantly expressed in 62.5% (15/24) of tumour tissues with high differentiation, but had a significantly lower or undetectable expression level in 75.7% (28/37) of tissues with moderate or low differentiation (P = 0.004). Moreover, high VDR expression was detected in 63.6% (14/22) of small tumours (≤25 mm) and in only 25.6% (10/39) of large tumours (>25 mm) (P = 0.06). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a low level of VDR expression in tumour tissues was associated with a poor prognosis (P = 0.037).VDR expression could be a potential prognostic factor for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and its effects should be examined in a prospective study. Vitamin D analogues may provide a therapeutic choice for patients with high VDR expression in tumours but a low vitamin D level in the circulation.",

Parameters of the laser therapy apparatus were: wavelength, 630nm, photosensitive drug hematoporphyrin, 5mg/kg, output power from the laser optical fiber end, 300mW/cm2, and exposure time,15min. Results Internal mammary lymph nodes metastasis was disappeared in 9 lymph nodes whose diameter ranged from 0.5cm to 1.0cm and 4 lymph nodes diminuted obviously whose diameter ranged from 1.1cm to 1.3cm. Conclusions Photodynamic therapy is an effective method to treat the metastasis of internal mammary lymph nodes from post-radical-operation of mastocarcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Spaced learning usually leads to better recognition memory as compared with massed learning, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive. One open question is whether the spacing effect is achieved by reducing neural repetition suppression. In this fMRI study, participants were scanned while intentionally memorizing 120 novel faces, half under the massed learning condition (i.e., four consecutive repetitions with jittered interstimulus interval) and the other half under the spaced learning condition (i.e., the four repetitions were interleaved). Recognition memory tests afterward revealed a significant spacing effect: Participants recognized more items learned under the spaced learning condition than under the massed learning condition. Successful face memory encoding was associated with stronger activation in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, which showed a significant repetition suppression effect modulated by subsequent memory status and spaced learning. Specifically, remembered faces showed smaller repetition suppression than forgotten faces under both learning conditions, and spaced learning significantly reduced repetition suppression. These results suggest that spaced learning enhances recognition memory by reducing neural repetition suppression.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Tantalum nitride (Ta 3 N 5 ) is a promising photoelectrode for solar water splitting. Although near-theoretical-limit photocurrent has already been reported on Ta 3 N 5 , its low photovoltage and poor stability remain critical challenges. In this study, we used Ta 3 N 5  nanotubes as a platform to understand the origins of these issues. Through a combination of photoelectrochemical and high-resolution electron microscope measurements, we found that the self-limiting surface oxidation of Ta 3 N 5  resulted in a thin amorphous layer (ca. 3 nm), which proved to be effective in pinning the surface Fermi levels and thus fully suppressed the photoactivity of Ta 3 N 5 . X-ray core-level spectroscopy characterization not only confirmed the surface composition change resulting from the oxidation but also revealed a Fermi-level shift toward the positive direction by up to 0.5 V. The photoactivity degradation mechanism reported here is likely to find applications in other solar-to-chemical energy-conversion systems.",

It has been suggested that genes involved in the dopamine, norepinephrine, and cholinergic systems play an essential role in the efficiency of human attention networks. Attention refers to the cognitive process of obtaining and maintaining the alert state, orienting to sensory events, and regulating the conflicts of thoughts and behavior. The present study tested seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the DDC gene for association with attention, which was assessed by the Attention Network Test to detect three networks of attention, including alerting, orienting, and executive attention, in a healthy Han Chinese sample (N=451). Association analysis for individual SNPs indicated that four of the seven SNPs (rs3887825, rs7786398, rs10499695, and rs6969081) were significantly associated with alerting attention. Haplotype-based association analysis revealed that alerting was associated with the haplotype G-A-T for SNPs rs7786398-rs10499695-rs6969081. These associations remained significant after correcting for multiple testing by max(T) permutation. No association was found for orienting and executive attention. This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of the DDC gene in alerting attention. A better understanding of the genetic basis of distinct attention networks would allow us to develop more effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of deficient or underdeveloped alerting attention as well as its related prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that amygdala structure is modulated by serotonin-related genes. However, there is a gap between the small contributions of single loci (less than 1%) and the reported 63-65% heritability of amygdala structure. To understand the \"missing heritability,\" we systematically explored the contribution of serotonin genes on amygdala structure at the gene set level. The present study of 417 healthy Chinese volunteers examined 129 representative polymorphisms in genes from multiple biological mechanisms in the regulation of serotonin neurotransmission. A system-level approach using multiple regression analyses identified that nine SNPs collectively accounted for approximately 8% of the variance in amygdala volume. Permutation analyses showed that the probability of obtaining these findings by chance was low (p = 0.043, permuted for 1000 times). Findings showed that serotonin genes contribute moderately to individual differences in amygdala volume in a healthy Chinese sample. These results indicate that the system-level approach can help us to understand the genetic basis of a complex trait such as amygdala structure.",

        "abstract": "Many real-life decisions in complex and changing environments are guided by the decision maker's beliefs, such as her perceived control over decision outcomes (i.e., agency), leading to phenomena like the \"illusion of control\". However, the neural mechanisms underlying the \"agency\" effect on belief-based decisions are not well understood. Using functional imaging and a card guessing game, we revealed that the agency manipulation (i.e., either asking the subjects (SG) or the computer (CG) to guess the location of the winning card) not only affected the size of subjects' bets, but also their \"world model\" regarding the outcome dependency. Functional imaging results revealed that the decision-related activation in the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) was significantly modulated by agency and previous outcome. Specifically, these PFC regions showed stronger activation when subjects made decisions after losses than after wins under the CG condition, but the pattern was reversed under the SG condition. Furthermore, subjects with high external attribution of negative events were more affected by agency at the behavioral and neural levels. These results suggest that the prefrontal decision-making system can be modulated by abstract beliefs, and are thus vulnerable to factors such as false agency and attribution.",

        "abstract": "Genes that are differentially expressed between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls may have key roles in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We analyzed two large-scale genome-wide expression studies, which examined changes in gene expression in schizophrenia patients and their matched controls. We found calcium/calmodulin (CAM)-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) is significantly downregulated in individuals with schizophrenia in both studies. To seek the potential genetic variants that may regulate the expression of CAMKK2, we investigated the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CAMKK2 and the expression level of CAMKK2. We found one SNP, rs1063843, which is located in intron 17 of CAMKK2, is strongly associated with the expression level of CAMKK2 in human brains (P=1.1 × 10(-6)) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (the lowest P=8.4 × 10(-6)). We further investigated the association between rs1063843 and schizophrenia in multiple independent populations (a total of 130 623 subjects) and found rs1063843 is significantly associated with schizophrenia (P=5.17 × 10(-5)). Interestingly, we found the T allele of rs1063843, which is associated with lower expression level of CAMKK2, has a higher frequency in individuals with schizophrenia in all of the tested samples, suggesting rs1063843 may be a causal variant. We also found that rs1063843 is associated with cognitive function and personality in humans. In addition, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed that CAMKK2 participates in a highly interconnected PPI network formed by top schizophrenia genes, which further supports the potential role of CAMKK2 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Taken together, these converging lines of evidence strongly suggest that CAMKK2 may have pivotal roles in schizophrenia susceptibility.",

Methods Cardiocytes of neonatal SD were cultured with Ang Ⅱ. Irbesartan was used to inhibit the effect of Ang II. For assessing protein synthesis rate, ANF, β-MHC and α-MHC gene expression in cardiomyocyte,the methods of 3H-Leucine incorporation and RT-QT-PCR were used.Results Ang Ⅱ could significantly increase 3H-Leucine incorporation and the gene expression of ANF and β-MHC compared with control group (P<0.05, 0.05,0.05), but decrease α-MHC gene expression(P<0.05),accompanied the decrease of α-MHC/β-MHC value(P<0.05). The effects of Ang Ⅱ were inhibited by irbesartan.The 3H-Leucine incorporation and the gene expression of ANF and β-MHC were decreased in the co-stimulation with Ang II and irbesartan, and no significant differences were found as compared with control group(P>0.05, 0.05, 0.05), but the gene expression of α-MHC was significantly inhanced(P<0.05). Similarly the value of α-MHC/ β-MHC was increased (P<0.05). Conclusion In cultured neonatal cardiocytes, irbesartan can inhibit cardiocyte hypertrophy and the shift from α-MHC to β-MHC gene expression induced by AngII.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The degradation model of stiffness matrix containing thermal-mechanical coupling damage was constructed by the user-defined subroutine VUMAT on the basis of continuum damage mechanics (CDM) and phenomenological analysis method, then, it was introduced to the software ABAQUS/Explicit to simulate the damage caused by lightning induced effects of thermal ablation and expansion on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates. The results revealed the evolution of the coupling damage from the analysis of stress-strain state and damage variables involved. It can be concluded that the thermal-mechanical coupling model pushed the simulated in-plane damage much closer to the experimental results than thermal ablation model, and the good consistency of simulated in-depth damage and experimental results indicated that the lightning induced in-depth damage was mainly brought from the combined impacts of thermal ablation and expansion.",

        "abstract": "One central goal in cognitive neuroscience of learning and memory is to characterize the neural processes that lead to long-lasting episodic memory. In addition to the stronger frontoparietal activity, greater category- or item-specific cortical representation during encoding, as measured by pattern similarity (PS), is also associated with better subsequent episodic memory. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether frontoparietal activity and cortical PS reflect distinct mechanisms. To address this issue, we reanalyzed previous data (Xue G, Dong Q, Chen C, Lu ZL, Mumford JA, Poldrack RA. 2010. Greater neural pattern similarity across repetitions is associated with better memory. Science. 330:97, Experiment 3) using a novel approach based on combined activation-based and information-based analyses. The results showed that across items, stronger frontoparietal activity was associated with greater PS in distributed brain regions, including those where the PS was predictive of better subsequent memory. Nevertheless, the item-specific PS was still associated with later episodic memory after controlling the effect of frontoparietal activity. Our results suggest that one possible mechanism of frontoparietal activity on episodic memory encoding is via enhancing PS, resulting in more unique and consistent input to the medial temporal lobe. In addition, they suggest that PS might index additional processes, such as pattern reinstatement as a result of study-phase retrieval, that contribute to episodic memory encoding.",

Previous studies have suggested that elevated Body Mass Index (BMI) might be associated with structural changes in both gray and white matter, but this association is still not well understood. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between BMI and brain structure with a relatively large sample of young adults (N = 336) in a small age range (20 ± 1 years). Voxel-based morphometry results showed significant negative correlations between BMI and gray-matter volumes in the midcingulate cortex (MCC), left orbital frontal cortex, and left ventromedial prefrontal cortex. There was also a significant negative correlation between BMI and white matter integrity as indexed by fractional anisotropy in bilateral cingulum. Further tractography analysis showed a significant negative correlation between BMI and the number of fibers passing the MCC region. Regression analysis showed that gray matter and white matter in these regions both contributed to the variance of BMI. These results remained significant even when analysis was restricted to the subjects with normal weights. Finally, we found that decision-making ability (as assessed by the Iowa Gambling Task) mediated the association between the structure of the MCC (a region responsible for impulse control and decision making) and BMI. These results shed light on the structural neural basis of weight variations.",

Our aim was to (1) determine the point in time of magnitude information access in visual number processing; and (2) identify at what stage the advantage of Arabic digits over Chinese verbal numbers occur. ERPs were recorded from 64 scalp sites while subjects (n=26) performed a classification task. Results showed that larger ERP amplitudes were elicited by numbers with distance-close condition in comparison to distance-far condition in the VPP component over centro-frontal sites. Furthermore, the VPP latency varied as a function of the symbol type, but the N170 did not. Such results demonstrate that magnitude information access takes place as early as 150 ms after onset of visual number stimuli and the advantage of Arabic digits over verbal numbers should be localized to the VPP component. We establish the VPP component as a critical ERP component to report in studies of numerical cognition and our results call into question the N170/VPP association hypothesis and the serial-stage model of visual number comparison processing.",

        "abstract": "As an electrochemical energy-storage technology with the highest theoretical capacity, lithium–oxygen batteries face critical challenges in terms of poor stabilities and low charge/discharge round-trip efficiencies. It is generally recognized that these issues are connected to the parasitic chemical reactions at the anode, electrolyte, and cathode. While the detailed mechanisms of these reactions have been studied separately, the possible synergistic effects between these reactions remain poorly understood. To fill in the knowledge gap, this Minireview examines literature reports on the parasitic chemical reactions and finds the reactive oxygen species a key chemical mediator that participates in or facilitates nearly all parasitic chemical reactions. Given the ubiquitous presence of oxygen in all test cells, this finding is important. It offers new insights into how to stabilize various components of lithium–oxygen batteries for high-performance operations and how to eventually materialize the full potentials of this promising technology.",

        "abstract": "The inertness of the C-H bond in CH poses significant challenges to selective CH oxidation, which often proceeds all the way to CO once activated. Selective oxidation of CH to high-value industrial chemicals such as CO or CHOH remains a challenge. Presently, the main methods to activate CH oxidation include thermochemical, electrochemical, and photocatalytic reactions. Of them, photocatalytic reactions hold great promise for practical applications but have been poorly studied. Existing demonstrations of photocatalytic CH oxidation exhibit limited control over the product selectivity, with CO as the most common product. The yield of CO or other hydrocarbons is too low to be of any practical value. In this work, we show that highly selective production of CO by CH oxidation can be achieved by a photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach. Under our experimental conditions, the highest yield for CO production was 81.9%. The substrate we used was TiO grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD), which features high concentrations of Ti species. The selectivity toward CO was found to be highly sensitive to the substrate types, with significantly lower yield on P25 or commercial anatase TiO substrates. Moreover, our results revealed that the selectivity toward CO also depends on the applied potentials. Based on the experimental results, we proposed a reaction mechanism that involves synergistic effects by adjacent Ti sites on TiO. Spectroscopic characterization and computational studies provide critical evidence to support the mechanism. Furthermore, the synergistic effect was found to parallel heterogeneous CO reduction mechanisms. Our results not only present a new route to selective CH oxidation, but also highlight the importance of mechanistic understandings in advancing heterogeneous catalysis.",

Organic fertilizer and mulch increased the soil water content before sowing at depth of 0-100 cm, 100-200 cm, 0-200 cm, 0-300 cm, and the effect of organic fertilizer and mulch on the soil water content at depth of 200-300 cm was not significant. The results also showed that, the effect of film mulch on the soil water content was greater than paper mulch and organic fertilizer could increase the extent of film mulch effect on soil water content. Mulching film could increase the soil water content at each soil layers of 40-160 cm under the condition of organic fertilizer, and could increase the soil water content at each soil layers of 40-140 cm under the condition of no fertilizer. Both of fertilizer and mulch all significantly increased yield. The analysis showed that soil water content at depth of 0-100 cm, 100-200 cm, 0-300 cm before sowing had a positive significant relationship with number per ear and yield, and the correlation between soil water content at each soil layers of 20-140 cm and yield, number per ear reached significant or very significant level. So organic fertilizer and mulch in fallow period could increase the soil water content before sowing and could improve yield in wheat under dryland condition, and film mulch with organic fertilizer was the best.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a compensatory stage of the heart in response to stress such as pressure overload (PO), which can develop into heart failure (HF) if left untreated. Resveratrol has been reported to prevent the development of hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction induced by PO. However, other studies found that resveratrol treatment for a longer period of time failed to regress cardiac hypertrophy. The aim of this study is to determine the timing of resveratrol treatment to achieve antihypertrophic effect and investigate whether resveratrol prevents the development of HF through preservation of myocardium structure and modulation of Ca(2+) handling proteins.To generate rats with cardiac hypertrophy, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to PO (aortic banding procedure) for 4 weeks. Sham-operated animals served as controls. Rats with cardiac hypertrophy were given resveratrol (4 mg/kg/day) for 4, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively. Histological and echocardiographic analysis and transmission electron microscopy were performed to assess cardiac structure and function. The levels of Ca(2+) handling proteins were measured by western blot analysis.Histological analysis showed that resveratrol treatment regressed developed cardiac hypertrophy at 8 and 10 weeks postsurgery, but not at 12 weeks. However, resveratrol strongly and continuously prevented the development of cardiac dysfunction and dilation of cardiac chamber as evaluated by echocardiography and H&amp;amp;E staining of heart cross-sections. In addition, PO-induced cardiac fibrosis was completely inhibited by resveratrol treatment. Resveratrol markedly prevented the disrupted myocardium but partially rescued mitochondrial abnormality in banded rats. Moreover, resveratrol prevented the alteration of Ca(2+) handling proteins induced by aortic banding, including downregulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2 (SERCA2) and ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), hypophosphorylated phospholamban (PLB), upregulation of Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchangers (NCX1) and increased expression and phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin -dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Moreover, resveratrol alleviated the decreased SERCA activity induced by aortic banding.Resveratrol effectively prevented the transition from compensatory to decompensatory stage of cardiac hypertrophy induced by PO, but this effect is dependent on the timing of treatment. We suggest that resveratrol may exert beneficial effects on cardiac hypertrophy through protection of cardiac structure and modulation of Ca(2+) handling proteins.",

        "abstract": "The seven-factor biopsychosocial model of personality distinguished four biologically based temperaments and three psychosocially based characters. Previous studies have suggested that the four temperaments-novelty seeking (NS), reward dependence (RD), harm avoidance (HA), and persistence (P)-have their respective neurobiological correlates, especially in the striatum-connected subcortical and cortical networks. However, few studies have investigated their neurobiological basis in the form of fiber connectivity between brain regions. This study correlated temperaments with fiber connectivity between the striatum and subcortical and cortical hub regions in a sample of 50 Chinese adult males. Generally consistent with our hypotheses, results showed that: (1) NS was positively correlated with fiber connectivity from the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC, lOFC) and amygdala to the striatum; (2) RD was positively correlated with fiber connectivity from the mOFC, posterior cingulate cortex/retrosplenial cortex (PCC), hippocampus, and amygdala to the striatum; (3) HA was positively linked to fiber connectivity from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and PCC to the striatum; and (4) P was positively linked to fiber connectivity from the mOFC to the striatum. These results extended the research on the neurobiological basis of temperaments by identifying their anatomical fiber connectivity correlates within the subcortical-cortical neural networks.",

        "abstract": "Human brain functional networks are topologically organized with nontrivial connectivity characteristics such as small-worldness and densely linked hubs to support highly segregated and integrated information processing. However, how they emerge and change at very early developmental phases remains poorly understood. Here, we used resting-state functional MRI and voxel-based graph theory analysis to systematically investigate the topological organization of whole-brain networks in 40 infants aged around 31 to 42 postmenstrual weeks. The functional connectivity strength and heterogeneity increased significantly in primary motor, somatosensory, visual, and auditory regions, but much less in high-order default-mode and executive-control regions. The hub and rich-club structures in primary regions were already present at around 31 postmenstrual weeks and exhibited remarkable expansions with age, accompanied by increased local clustering and shortest path length, indicating a transition from a relatively random to a more organized configuration. Moreover, multivariate pattern analysis using support vector regression revealed that individual brain maturity of preterm babies could be predicted by the network connectivity patterns. Collectively, we highlighted a gradually enhanced functional network segregation manner in the third trimester, which is primarily driven by the rapid increases of functional connectivity of the primary regions, providing crucial insights into the topological development patterns prior to birth.",

Paired sample t-test, χ(2) test, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used to analyze the results of our experiments, respectively.IHC showed that there was no differential expression of Numb in PDAC and adjacent pancreas (t = 1.746, P = 0.086) , while the expression of MDM2 and p53 was significantly increased in PDAC, compared to that in paired normal pancreas (t = 3.294, P = 0.002; t = 3.152, P = 0.002, respectively) .Numb expression was negatively associated with tumor size (χ² = 5.206, P = 0.023), differentiation (χ² = 7.802, P = 0.005) and UICC stage (χ² = 4.770, P = 0.029), while expression of MDM2 and p53 was positively associated with tumor T and TNM stage, respectively (χ² = 5.182, P = 0.023; χ² = 6.448, P = 0.011) . Correlation analysis showed a negative association between Numb and MDM2 (r = -0.283, P = 0.023) , but there was no relationship of them with p53 (P > 0.05) .Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that Numb was a protective prognostic indicator for patients with PDAC (χ² = 5.408, P = 0.020). Moreover, patients with Numb positive and MDM2 negative expression had a significantly better overall survival (χ² = 5.868, P = 0.015). Western blot showed that Numb expression was much higher in well differentiated PDAC than that in paired normal pancreas (t = 1.092, P = 0.020) , while the expression of MDM2 and p53 was significantly increased in 16 cases of PDAC (t = 3.263, P = 0.005; t = 3.607, P = 0.003, respectively). Numb expression was gradually increased in pancreatic cancer cells with the increasing degree of cell differentiation detected by IF, Westem blot and qRT-PCR.Numb acts as a tumor suppressor gene in the development of PDAC. Numb, MDM2 and p53 might coordinately participate in the development of PDAC.",

        "abstract": "Plants have developed a number of survival strategies which are significant for enhancing their adaptation to various biotic and abiotic stress factors. At the transcriptome level, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are of great significance, enabling the plants to detect a wide range of endogenous and exogenous signals which are employed by the plants in regulating various responses in development and adaptation. In this research work, we carried out genome-wide analysis of target of Myb1 (), a member of the GPCR gene family. The functional role of TOM1 in salt stress tolerance was studied using a transgenic  plants over-expressing the gene. By the use of the functional domain PF06454, we obtained 16  genes members in , 9 in , and 11 in . The genes had varying physiochemical properties, and it is significant to note that all the grand average of hydropathy (GRAVY) values were less than one, indicating that all are hydrophobic in nature. In all the genes analysed here, both the exonic and intronic regions were found. The expression level of  was significantly high in the transgenic lines as compared to the wild type; a similar trend in expression was observed in all the salt-related genes tested in this study. The study in epidermal cells confirmed the localization of the protein coded by the gene  in the plasma membrane. Analysis of anti-oxidant enzymes showed higher concentrations of antioxidants in transgenic lines and relatively lower levels of oxidant substances such as H₂O₂. The low malondialdehyde (MDA) level in transgenic lines indicated that the transgenic lines had relatively low level of oxidative damage compared to the wild types. The results obtained indicate that  can be a putative target gene for enhancing salt stress tolerance in plants and could be exploited in the future for the development of salt stress-tolerant cotton cultivars.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on Ca~ 2+ /CaM-dependent calcineurin (CaN) signaling pathway of cardiomyocytes in rats. Methods Cardiomyocytes of neonatal Wistar rats were cultured with NPY. Cyclosporine A (CsA) was used to inhibit the activity of CaN. Western blot and histochemistry were used to assess CaN expression and CaN activity. Fluorescent assay with Fluo3-AM was used to detect [Ca~ 2+ ] in plasm and nucleus of cardiomyocytes. Results To compare with control group, the activity of CaN in NPY(100 nmol/L) group was enhanced remarkably (P<0.05). There were no significant changes of CaN activity among NPY(10 nmol/L) group, CsA (100 nmol/L NPY + 5 μg/ml CsA) group and control group. CaN-α expression was elevated considerably in cardiomyocytes stimulated by NPY(100 nmol/L) compared with control group(P<0.05). Within 10 min,there were no considerable changes of the [Ca~ 2+ ] in plasm and nucleus stimulated by NPY(100 nmol/L). 24 h after incubation, the [Ca~ 2+ ] in plasma and nuclear in NPY(100 nmol/L) group was significantly elevated compared with control group(P<0.01). Conclusion NPY can activate the Ca~ 2+ /CaM-dependent calcineurin signaling pathway of cardiomyocytes, and the enhancement of [Ca~ 2+ ] induced by NPY may be the first step in it.",

        "abstract": "An explanatory model of adolescent health-enhancing behavior based on protective and risk factors at the individual level and in 4 social contexts was used in a study of school-based samples from the People's Republic of China (n 1,739) and the United States (n 1,596). A substantial account of variation in health-enhancing behavior—and of its developmental change over time—was provided by the model for boys and girls, and for the 3 grade cohorts, in both samples. In both samples, social context protective and risk factors accounted for more unique variance than did individual-level protective and risk factors, and context protection moderated both contextual and individual-level risk. Models protection and controls protection were of particular importance in the explanatory account. The focus of this study is on the role of the everyday social context in accounting for variation in adolescents' engagement in health-enhancing behavior and its development over time. The research uses a theoretical framework about three kinds of protec- tive factors (models protection, controls protection, and support protection) and three kinds of risk factors (models risk, opportunity risk, and vulnerability risk) to articulate the explanatory content of the social contexts that adolescents traverse in their daily lives. Linkages are examined between protective and risk factors in four key contexts—the family, the peer group, the school, and the neighborhood—and involvement in health-enhancing behavioral practices, including eating a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, getting adequate sleep, engaging in safety practices such as seatbelt use, and practicing good dental hygiene.",

        "abstract": "We identified 672, 374, and 379 CYPs proteins encoded by the CYPs genes in Gossypium hirsutum, Gossypium raimondii, and Gossypium arboreum, respectively. The genes were found to be distributed in all 26 chromosomes of the tetraploid cotton, with chrA05, chrA12, and their homeolog chromosomes harboring the highest number of genes. The physiochemical properties of the proteins encoded by the CYP450 genes varied in terms of their protein lengths, molecular weight, isoelectric points (pI), and even grand hydropathy values (GRAVY). However, over 99% of the cotton proteins had GRAVY values below 0, which indicated that the majority of the proteins encoded by the CYP450 genes were hydrophilic in nature, a common property of proteins encoded by stress-responsive genes. Moreover, through the RNA interference (RNAi) technique, the expression levels of Gh_D07G1197 and Gh_A13G2057 were suppressed, and the silenced plants showed a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with a significant reduction in the concentration levels of glutathione (GSH), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and proline compared to the wild types under drought and salt stress conditions. Furthermore, the stress-responsive genes 1-Pyrroline–5-Carboxylate Synthetase (GhP5CS), superoxide dismutase (GhSOD), and myeloblastosis (GhMYB) were downregulated in VIGS plants, but showed upregulation in the leaf tissues of the wild types under drought and salt stress conditions. In addition, CYP450-silenced cotton plants exhibited a high level of oxidative injury due to high levels of oxidant enzymes, in addition to negative effects on CMS, ELWL, RLWC, and chlorophyll content The results provide the basic foundation for future exploration of the proteins encoded by the CYP450 genes in order to understand the physiological and biochemical mechanisms in enhancing drought and salt stress tolerance in plants.",

Here, we report a surprising observation that unique reactions at this interface under photo-electrochemical (PEC) conditions lead to unusual performance enhancement of Ta 3 N 5  for solar water oxidation reactions. The enhancement was only observed when Co(OH) 2  was introduced as a water oxidation co-catalyst. Illumination and positive bias were also critical to the enhancement. It was proposed that O •  radical formation induced by illumination results in the formation of Ta-O-Co bonds, which exhibit less severe Fermi-level pinning when compared with Ta-O-Ta bonds that are more commonly observed on bare Ta 3 N 5  under normal PEC conditions. When a high-performance oxygen evolution catalyst such as cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) was added to the Ta 3 N 5 /Co(OH) 2  system, high photocurrent densities and good stability were achieved simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "As the only species that evolved to possess a language faculty, humans have been surprisingly generative in creating a diverse array of language systems. These systems vary in phonology, morphology, syntax, and written forms. Before the advent of modern brain-imaging techniques, little was known about how differences across languages are reflected in the brain. This chapter aims to provide an overview of an emerging area of research - cultural neurolinguistics - that examines systematic cross-cultural/crosslinguistic variations in the neural networks of languages. We first briefly describe general brain networks for written and spoken languages. We then discuss language-specific brain regions by highlighting differences in neural bases of different scripts (logographic vs. alphabetic scripts), orthographies (transparent vs. nontransparent orthographies), and tonality (tonal vs. atonal languages). We also discuss neural basis of second language and the role of native language experience in second-language acquisition. In the last section, we outline a general model that integrates culture and neural bases of language and discuss future directions of research in this area.",

        "abstract": "Abiotic stresses have negative effects on plants growth and development. Plants, being sessile, have developed specific adaptive strategies that allow them to rapidly detect and respond to abiotic stress factors. The detoxification efflux carriers (DTX)/multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters are of significance in the translocation of abscisic acid (ABA), a phytohormone with profound role in plants under various abiotic stress conditions. The ABA signaling cascades are the core regulators of abiotic stress responses in plants, triggering major changes in gene expression and adaptive physiological responses. We therefore carried out genome-wide analysis of the  gene family, transformed a  gene in Arabidopsis and carried out functional analysis under drought, salt, and cold stress conditions. We identified 128, 70, and 72  genes in , and , respectively. The proteins encoded by the  genes showed varied physiochemical properties but they all were hydrophobic. The  () over-expressing Arabidopsis lines were highly tolerant under drought, salt, and cold stress with high production of antioxidant enzymes and significantly reduced levels of oxidants. Lipid peroxidation, as measured by the level of malondialdehyde concentrations was relatively low in transgenic lines compared to wild types, an indication of reduced oxidative stress levels in the transgenic plants. Based on physiological measurements, the transgenic plants exhibited significantly higher relative leaf water content, reduced excised leaf water loss and a significant reduction in ion leakage as a measure of the cell membrane stability compared to the wild types. Abiotic stress responsive genes, , and  were highly expressed in the transgenic lines compared to the non-transformed wild type plants. The protein encoded by the  () gene was predicted to be located within the plasma membrane. Since signals from extracellular stimuli are transmitted through the plasma membrane most of which are conducted by plasma membrane proteins it is possible the  () gene product could be important for this process.",

Vowel identification in quiet and noise was assessed before, right after training, and three months later after training. Results showed that all listeners significantly improved their vowel identification after training, and the training effect was retained three months later.

        "abstract": "In the present study, we explored how Age of Acquisition (AoA) of L2 affected brain structures in bilingual individuals. Thirty-six native English speakers who were bilingual were scanned with high resolution MRI. After MRI signal intensity inhomogeneity correction, we applied both voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM) approaches to the data. VBM analysis was performed using FSL's standard VBM processing pipeline. For the SBM analysis, we utilized a semi-automated sulci delineation procedure, registered the brains to an atlas, and extracted measures of twenty four pre-selected regions of interest. We addressed three questions: (1) Which areas are more susceptible to differences in AoA? (2) How do AoA, proficiency and current level of exposure work together in predicting structural differences in the brain? And (3) What is the direction of the effect of AoA on regional volumetric and surface measures? Both VBM and SBM results suggested that earlier second language exposure was associated with larger volumes in the right parietal cortex. Consistently, SBM showed that the cortical area of the right superior parietal lobule increased as AoA decreased. In contrast, in the right pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus, AoA, proficiency, and current level of exposure are equally important in accounting for the structural differences. We interpret our results in terms of current theory and research on the effects of L2 learning on brain structures and functions.",

Such a challenge imposes tight requirements to the enhanced robustness and accuracy of the vehicle autopilot. The key of this paper is to introduce the model of attitude dynamics and propose a novel finite-time observer-based super twisting sliding mode control scheme for fixed-wing UAV. The observer designed in this paper can not only estimate the attitude rate but also the torque perturbation exactly in finite time. Then combined with the observer, a continuous homogeneous second-order sliding mode controller based on the terminal sliding mode and super twisting algorithm is designed to achieve a finite-time and exact attitude tracking with chattering attenuation. Finally, some simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the integrated control scheme in attitude tracking.",

The Markov models of elements without repair and under CBM are established, and an absorbing set is introduced to determine the reliability of the repairable element. According to the state-transition relations between the states determined by the Markov process, a DBN model is built. In addition, its parameters for series and parallel systems, namely, conditional probability tables, can be calculated by referring to the conditional degradation probabilities. Finally, the power of a control unit in a failure model is used as an example. A dynamic fault tree (DFT) is translated into a Bayesian network model, and subsequently extended to a DBN. The results show the state probabilities of an element and the system without repair, with perfect and imperfect repair, and under CBM, with an absorbing set plotted by differential equations and verified. Through referring forward, the reliability value of the control unit is determined in different kinds of modes. Finally, weak nodes are noted in the control unit.",

Human and animal studies have implicated serotonin in appetite regulation, and behavior genetic studies have shown that body mass index (BMI) has a strong genetic component. However, the roles of genes related to the serotoninergic (5-hydroxytryptamine,5-HT) system in obesity/BMI are not well understood, especially in Chinese subjects.With a sample of 478 healthy Chinese volunteers, this study investigated the relation between BMI and genetic variations of the serotoninergic system as characterized by 136 representative polymorphisms. We used a system-level approach to identify SNPs associated with BMI, then estimated their overall contribution to BMI by multiple regression and verified it by permutation.We identified 12 SNPs that made statistically significant contributions to BMI. After controlling for gender and age, four of these SNPs accounted for 7.7% additional variance of BMI. Permutation analysis showed that the probability of obtaining these findings by chance was low (p = 0.015, permuted for 1000 times).These results showed that genetic variations in the serotoninergic system made a moderate contribution to individual differences in BMI among a healthy Chinese sample, suggesting that a similar approach can be used to study obesity.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoTs) and pervasive use of many different types of mobile computing devices make wireless communication spectrum a precious resource. In order to accommodate the still fast increasing number of devices requesting wireless connection, more efficient, fine-grained spectrum allocation and sharing schemes are badly in need. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been widely recognized as one promising solution, in which the secondary users (SUs) are allowed to share channels with licensed primary users (PUs) as long as bringing no interference to the normal operations of the PUs. However, malicious attackers or selfish SUs may mimic the behavior of PUs to occupy the channels illegally. It is nontrivial to accurately, timely detect such kind of primary user emulation (PUE) attacks. In this paper, an efficient PUE attacked detection method is introduced leveraging the recurrent neural network (RNN). After a fundamental algorithm using basic RNN, an advanced version taking advantage of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) is proposed, which is more efficient on processing time series with long term memory. The experimental study has provided deeper insights about the different performances the RNNs achieved and validated the effectiveness of the proposed detectors.",

        "abstract": "Many previous studies have demonstrated the SNARC effect-i.e., participants are faster to respond with their left/right hand to small/large numbers. However, there is a debate on whether it is based on working or long-term memory (i.e., relative or absolute magnitude). Here, we examined the flexibility of the spatial-numerical associations using orientation judgment tasks. Participants were asked to judge the orientation of a rotated frame surrounding an Arabic digit under numerical ranges 1-6, 4-9 (Experiment 1), and 1-9 (Experiment 2). The task difficulty was manipulated by rotating stimuli. We observed a significant SNARC effect for range 1-6 and a reversed SNARC effect for 4-9, regardless of the total numerical range presented in the task. Furthermore, the SNARC effect became more salient with increasing task difficulty. Our results suggest that the SNARC effect is based on the absolute magnitude of digits, supporting the long-term memory explanation.",

        "abstract": "Precision medicine is becoming the goal of translational research on colorectal cancer. Accurate molecular subtyping contributes to better guidance of clinical practice. The current TNM staging system of colorectal cancer is inadequate in terms of guiding clinical practice, such as the underestimation of prognosis of with stage II( and III( colorectal cancer TNM staging, and identification of high-risk and low-risk patients with stage II( colorectal cancer. Researchers from Europe and US have proposed a number of molecular subtypings with clinicopathological phenotypes and molecular phenotypes, which has certain practical significance and is beneficial to the choice of treatment regimen and targeted drugs. But the current results of subtyping research require further validations by clinical large scale multi-center trials. Based on precision medicine, molecular subtyping gradually reveals its clinical significance and is optimized through combining genomics with various clinical phenotypes, indicating its guidance for clinical practice, which is the inevitable course of precision medicine accomplishment. In recent years, there have been many new advances in colorectal cancer liver metastasis treatment. The prognosis of colorectal cancer patients undergoing resection of liver metastasis lesion is similar to those with stage III(. Early recurrence within 6 months after translational treatment and resection occurred in about one third of the patients with initially unresectable liver metastasis, and the overall survival was poor. Thus, an evaluation system should be established in order to avoid the strong therapy and strive for better quality of life in some patients. Individualized treatment for colorectal cancer is emphasized increasingly. Body fluid (peripheral blood and urine) marker detection is a recent research hotspot, including serum protein(polypeptide), plasma miRNA, circulating tumor cells and circulating nucleic acid. ",

        "abstract": "The genetic and neural basis of working memory (WM) has been extensively studied. Many dopamine (DA) related genes, including the NTSR1 gene (a DA modulator gene), have been reported to be associated with WM performance. The NTSR1 protein is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, the latter of which is closely involved in WM processing based on both lesion and fMRI studies. Thus far, however, no study has examined the joint effects of NTSR1 gene polymorphism and hippocampal morphology on WM performance. Participants of the current study were 330 healthy Chinese college students. WM performance was measured with a 2-back WM paradigm. Structural MRI data were acquired and then analyzed using an automated procedure with atlas-based FreeSurfer segmentation software (v 4.5.0) package. Linear regression analyses were conducted with a NTSR1 C/T polymorphism which was previously reported to be associated with WM (rs4334545), hippocampal volume, and their interaction as predictors of WM performance, with gender and intracranial volume (ICV) as covariates. Results showed a significant interaction between NTSR1 genotype and hippocampal volume (p<.05 for both the left and right hippocampi). Further analysis showed that the correlation between hippocampal volume and WM scores was significant for carriers of the NTSR1 T-allele (p<.05 for both hippocampi), but not for CC homozygotes. These results indicate that the association between hippocampal structure and WM performance was modulated by variation in the NTSR1 gene, and suggest that further studies of brain-behavior associations should take genetic background information into account.",

The current study investigated the role of the S100B gene in an endophenotype of schizophrenia-spatial disability. 304 schizophrenia patients and 196 healthy controls were given a block design task and a mental rotation task. Results showed that the two aforementioned SNPs and related haplotypes were associated with the spatial disability of schizophrenia patients. Specifically, risk factors for the elevated S100B levels, including the A allele of rs9722, the G allele of rs1051169, and the AG haplotype, were associated with a poorer performance on both tests of spatial ability, especially the mental rotation task. These results implicate a role for S100B gene polymorphisms in the cognitive functions of schizophrenia patients and encourage further investigation into spatial disability as an endophenotype of schizophrenia.",

In this work, we develop a deep learning framework capable of model transfer learning from well-controlled shop clothing images collected from web retailers to in-the-wild images from the street. Specifically, we formulate a novel Multi-Task Curriculum Transfer (MTCT) deep learning method to explore multiple sources of different types of web annotations with multi-labelled fine-grained attributes. Our multi-task loss function is designed to extract more discriminative representations in training by jointly learning all attributes, and our curriculum strategy exploits the staged easy-to-hard transfer learning motivated by cognitive studies. We demonstrate the advantages of the MTCT model over the state-of-the-art methods on the X-Domain benchmark, a large scale clothing attribute dataset. Moreover, we show that the MTCT model has a notable advantage over contemporary models when the training data size is small.",

This study investigated whether experimentally created false memories would persist for an extended period (one and a half years). A large number of subjects (N=342) participated in a standard three-stage misinformation procedure (saw the event slides, read the narrations with misinformation, and then took the memory tests). The initial tests showed that misinformation led to a significant amount of false memory. One and a half years later, the participants were tested again. About half of the misinformation false memory persisted, which was the same rate as for true memory. These results strongly suggest that brief exposure to misinformation can lead to long-term false memory and that the strength of memory trace was similar for true and false memories. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In order to determine the therapeutic effect and mechanism of paeonol on acute kidney injury induced by endotoxin, an acute kidney injury model was established by intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide in mice in vivo and on LPS-induced dendritic cells in vitro. Renal tissues were used for histologic examination. Concentrations of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were detected, inflammatory cytokines were determined by ELISA. The relative proteins' expression of TLR4-NF-κB signal pathway was assessed by Western blot, the localization and expression of phospho-NF-κB p65 in kidney was monitored by immunohistochemistry.Treatment of paeonol successfully cuts histopathological scores and dilutes the concentrations of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine as index of renal injury severity. In addition, paeonol reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases anti-inflammatory cytokines stimulated by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Paeonol also inhibits the expression of phosphorylated NF-κB p65, IκBα and IKKβ, and restrains NF-κB p65 DNA-binding activity. Paeonol treatment also attenuates the effects of LPS on dendritic cells, with significant inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines release, then TLR4 expression and NF-κB signal pathway have been suppressed.These results indicated that paeonol has protective effects on endotoxin-induced kidney injury. The mechanisms underlying such effects are associated with its successfully attenuate inflammatory and suppresses TLR4 and NF-κB signal pathway. Therefore, paeonol has great potential to be a novel and natural product agent for treating AKI or septic-AKI.",

Mirroring the standard three-stage misinformation paradigm (original event, misinformation, and test), subjects in the experimental group were first given a colour-slide presentation of two stories (events), then given an accurate account (instead of misinformation) of the events in narrations, and finally tested for their memory of the original events. One month later, they underwent the standard misinformation paradigm with two new events. The comparison group was given the standard misinformation tasks at both time points. Results showed that the experimental group produced more false memories in the subsequent misinformation paradigm than did the comparison group.

Cell invasion and migration assays were used to observe the effect of Gli1, MDM2 and p53 silence on cell invasion and migration in p53 wild-type Capan-2 pancreatic cancer cells, respectively. Meanwhile, immunoblotting (IB) was used to detect the protein level of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -9, phospho-excelluar signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and phosphorylation protein kinase B (pAKT) in Gli1-silencing Capan-2 cells. The data were analyzed by paired t-test.qRT-PCR showed that the expression of Gli1, MDM2 and p53 is down-regulated 70.5% and 74.5%, 61.8% and 65.3%, and 73.8% and 78.2% after siRNA interference, compared with the mock and siRNA control groups, respectively. Cell invasion (94 ± 8) and migration (143 ± 8) in p53 wild-type Capan-2 cells transfected with Gli1siRNA were significantly decreased, compared with the siRNA control group (150 ± 7, 190 ± 10) (t = 6.584, P = 0.022; t = 8.266, P = 0.014) , while MDM2 silence inhibited cell invasion (experiment group:85 ± 12, control group: 138 ± 6) and migration (experiment group: 127 ± 9, control group:180 ± 10) in the same cells, respectively (t = 5.097, P = 0.036;t = 4.860, P = 0.040). However, cell invasion (experiment group: 153 ± 11, control group: 106 ± 7) and migration (experiment group: 209 ± 13, control group: 164 ± 8) in p53-silencing Capan-2 cells were significantly enhanced (t = 4.669, P = 0.043; t = 4.990, P = 0.038). IB showed that Gli1 silence down-regulated MMP-9 but not pERK and pAKT protein expression.Gli1 might contribute to the cell invasion and migration in pancreatic cancer via the regulation of MDM2, p53 and MMP-9 expression.",

However, its role in working memory, a cognitive function that is impaired in both diseases, is not clear. Using three samples, including healthy controls, patients with SCZ, and patients currently in manic episodes of BP, this study tested the association between the SNP rs1006737 and spatial working memory as measured by an N-back task and a dot pattern expectancy (DPX) task. Among SCZ patients and healthy controls, the clinical risk allele was associated with impaired working memory, but the association was either in opposite direction or non-significant in patients with BP. These results indicated that rs1006737 may have differential effects on working memory in different disease populations and pointed to the necessity for more studies in different patient populations.",

        "abstract": "Musical training confers advantages in speech-sound processing, which could play an important role in early childhood education. To understand the mechanisms of this effect, we used event-related potential and behavioral measures in a longitudinal design. Seventy-four Mandarin-speaking children aged 4-5 y old were pseudorandomly assigned to piano training, reading training, or a no-contact control group. Six months of piano training improved behavioral auditory word discrimination in general as well as word discrimination based on vowels compared with the controls. The reading group yielded similar trends. However, the piano group demonstrated unique advantages over the reading and control groups in consonant-based word discrimination and in enhanced positive mismatch responses (pMMRs) to lexical tone and musical pitch changes. The improved word discrimination based on consonants correlated with the enhancements in musical pitch pMMRs among the children in the piano group. In contrast, all three groups improved equally on general cognitive measures, including tests of IQ, working memory, and attention. The results suggest strengthened common sound processing across domains as an important mechanism underlying the benefits of musical training on language processing. In addition, although we failed to find far-transfer effects of musical training to general cognition, the near-transfer effects to speech perception establish the potential for musical training to help children improve their language skills. Piano training was not inferior to reading training on direct tests of language function, and it even seemed superior to reading training in enhancing consonant discrimination.",

Two possible explanations were proposed: (1) CNU listeners used temporal dips of noise more efficiently than CNC listeners; and (2) CNU listeners had less informational masking of MTB than their CNC peers. The current study explored whether the difference in noise processing between CNU and CNC listeners was also presented for their native speech perception. Chinese vowel-plus-tone identifications were measured for CNU and CNC in quiet, stationary and TM noise, babble-modulated noise, and MTB. The identification scores of CNU listeners were significantly higher than CNC listeners in most noisy backgrounds, whereas both groups had the same performance in quiet. Moreover, compared with CNC listeners, CNU listeners gained greater masking releases from the temporal modulation in TM noise at low SNRs, whereas no significant difference was found in informational masking between the two groups. In conclusion, the native English experience may improve native Chinese listeners' capacity to use temporal glimpses in TM noise, possibly depending on the modulation frequency and depth, while it may not improve their ability to resist the informational masking of babble when perceiving their native speech.",

Methods Cardiomyocytes of neonatal Wistar rats were cultured in the presence of 10 and 100 nmol/L NPY, and cyclosporine A (CsA) was applied to inhibit the activity of CaN. The protein synthesis rate, c-jun mRNA expression, CaN protein expression, CaN activity and intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the cardiomyocytes were assessed. Results Compared with the control group, 3H-Leu incorporation and expression of c-jun mRNA in the cardiomyocytes treated with 100 nmol/L NPY increased significantly (P<0.05, P<0.001), and the effect of NPY was blocked by CsA. The activity of CaN (P<0.05), CaN expression (P<0.05), and Ca2+ concentration in the cytoplasm (P<0. 001) and nuclei (P<0.001) of the cells with 100 nmol/L NPY treatment also significantly increased compared with those in the control cells.

The definite function of Gli1 in regulating the EMT of pancreatic cancer (PC), however, is still unclear.At the cell and tissue levels, we investigated the role of Gli1 in the initiation of EMT in PC with and without external stimulus treatments.The immunohistochemistry results showed that Gli1 was associated positively with MMP9 but not with E-cad or Vimentin. Gli1 expression was associated positively with tumor T (P = .025) and Union for International Cancer Control stage (P = .032), whereas MMP9 expression was associated positively with lymph node metastasis (P = .017) and Union for International Cancer Control stage (P = .006). Furthermore, patients with Gli1 and MMP9 coexpression had poor overall survival (P = .015). Silencing of Gli1 alone without external stimulus had no effect on EMT but inhibited transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFβ1)- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced EMT in PANC-1, AsPC-1, and BxPC-3 PC cell lines, along with the inhibition of TGFβ1- and EGF-induced EMT-like cell morphology and invasion, down-regulation of E-cad, and up-regulation of MMP9 and Vimentin in those 3 cell lines, respectively.Gli1 silencing alone has no effect on EMT initiation; however, it exerts a protumor role in the aggressive invasion of PC cells by promoting TGFβ1- and EGF-induced EMT.",

        "abstract": "Greatly expanded brain volume is one of the most characteristic traits that distinguish humans from other primates. Recent studies have revealed genes responsible for the dramatically enlarged human brain size (i.e., the microcephaly genes), and it has been well documented that many microcephaly genes have undergone accelerated evolution along the human lineage. In addition to being far larger than other primates, human brain volume is also highly variable in general populations. However, the genetic basis underlying human brain volume variation remains elusive and it is not known whether genes regulating human brain volume variation also have experienced positive selection. We have previously shown that genetic variants (near the IL3 gene) on 5q33 were significantly associated with brain volume in Chinese population. Here, we provide further evidence that support the significant association of genetic variants on 5q33 with brain volume. Bioinformatic analyses suggested that rs31480 is likely to be the causal variant among the studied SNPs. Molecular evolutionary analyses suggested that IL3 might have undergone positive selection in primates and humans. Neutrality tests further revealed signatures of positive selection of IL3 in Han Chinese and Europeans. Finally, extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) and relative EHH analyses showed that the C allele of SNP rs31480 might have experienced recent positive selection in Han Chinese. Our results suggest that IL3 is an important genetic regulator for human brain volume variation and implied that IL3 might have experienced weak or modest positive selection in the evolutionary history of humans, which may be due to its contribution to human brain volume.",

Western blot and RT-PCR were used to examine the expression of CRT protein and mRNA in 12 paired fresh PDAC specimens and adjuvant non-cancerous pancreatic tissues. The relationship between the protein expression and clinicopathological features was analyzed.CRT expression was much higher in 33 PDAC tissues than that in paired adjacent non-cancerous pancreatic samples (t = 2.323, P = 0.027). CRT was over expressed in 16 PDAC tissues, but only in 8 adjuvant non-cancerous pancreatic tissues (48.5% vs. 24.2%). The expression of CRT protein had no correlation with tumor position (χ(2) = 1.588, P = 0.208), differentiation (χ(2) = 1.517, P = 0.218), TNM stage (χ(2) = 2.528, P = 0.112) and lymph node metastasis (χ(2) = 1.963, P = 0.161), but had statistic significancy with the prognosis of the patients (χ(2) = 4.080, P = 0.043). The median survival time in the patients with high expression of CRT protein was longer than that in the patients with low expression. The expression of CRT mRNA was higher in PDAC than that in non-cancerous tissues detected by RT-PCR (t = 2.539, P = 0.025), but no significant difference was found in protein level (t = 1.292, P = 0.223).CRT is up-regulated in PDAC and may be a prognosis factor for patients with PDAC.",

However, whether the two genes have interactive effects on resting-state activities of the brain and whether these spontaneous activations correlate with WM are still unknown. This study included behavioral data from WM tasks and genetic data ( rs4680 and  Val66Met) from 417 healthy Chinese adults and resting-state fMRI data from 298 of them. Significant interactive effects of  and  were found for WM performance as well as for resting-state regional homogeneity (ReHo) in WM-related brain areas, including the left medial frontal gyrus (lMeFG), left superior frontal gyrus (lSFG), right superior and medial frontal gyrus (rSMFG), right medial orbitofrontal gyrus (rMOFG), right middle frontal gyrus (rMFG), precuneus, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, and right inferior parietal lobule.

In this study, 157, 85 and 89 candidate LEA2 proteins were identified in ,  and  respectively.  genes were classified into 6 groups, designated as group 1 to 6. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed orthologous gene pairs within the cotton genome. The cotton specific LEA2 motifs identified were E, R and D in addition to Y, K and S motifs. The genes were distributed on all chromosomes. LEA2s were found to be highly enriched in non-polar, aliphatic amino acid residues, with leucine being the highest, 9.1% in proportion. The miRNA, ghr-miR827a/b/c/d and ghr-miR164 targeted many genes are known to be drought stress responsive. Various stress-responsive regulatory elements, ABA-responsive element (ABRE), Drought-responsive Element (DRE/CRT), MYBS and low-temperature-responsive element (LTRE) were detected. Most genes were highly expressed in leaves and roots, being the primary organs greatly affected by water deficit. The expression levels were much higher in  as opposed to  The tolerant genotype had higher capacity to induce more of  genes. Over expression of the transformed gene  showed that the  genes are involved in promoting root growth and in turn confers drought stress tolerance. We therefore infer that , ,  and  could be the candidate genes with profound functions under drought stress in upland cotton among the  genes. The transformed  plants showed higher tolerance levels to drought stress compared to the wild types. There was significant increase in antioxidants, catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) accumulation, increased root length and significant reduction in oxidants, Hydrogen peroxide (HO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in the leaves of transformed lines under drought stress condition. This study provides comprehensive analysis of LEA2 proteins in cotton thus forms primary foundation for breeders to utilize these genes in developing drought tolerant genotypes.",

Due to the unregulated wireless network environment, CRNs are susceptible to various malicious entities. Thus, it is critical to detect anomalies in the first place. However, from the perspective of intrinsic features of CRNs, there is hardly in existence of an universal applicable anomaly detection scheme. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) has been theoretically proven an optimal approach for accurate and quick detection of changes in the characteristics of a running (random) process. In addition, SSA is a model-free method and no parametric models have to be assumed for different types of anomalies, which makes it a universal anomaly detection scheme. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive parameter and component selection mechanism based on coherence for basic SSA method, upon which we built up a sliding window based anomaly detector in CRNs. Our experimental results indicate great accuracy of the SSA-based anomaly detector for multiple anomalies.",

        "abstract": "Intertemporal choice refers to the process of making decisions by weighing short- and long-term benefits and costs. On average people prefer immediate rewards over delayed rewards with larger amounts, which is a form of decision impulsivity. Based on previous research showing the importance of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in decision impulsivity, the present study examined whether regional homogeneity (ReHo) patterns in DMPFC were associated with individual differences in intertemporal choices. Two cohorts of college students (N = 239 and N = 227, respectively) were recruited and resting-state data were collected. Results from both univariate and multivariate pattern analyses of the two cohorts consistently showed that ReHo patterns in the DMPFC were associated with the delay discounting rate (i.e., log k). These results further support the important role of DMPFC in intertemporal choice and have potential practical implications for decision making in our daily life and at the level of national policies as well as for the treatment of clinical populations with decision impulsivity (e.g., gamblers, individuals with substance use disorders).",

Twelve Chinese college students who were learning English were scanned when they performed language switching tasks (naming pictures in their first [L1, Chinese] and second [L2, English] languages according to response cues). Compared to non-switching conditions, language switching elicited greater activation in the right superior prefrontal cortex (BA9/10/32), left middle and superior frontal cortex (BA8/9/46), and right middle cingulum and caudate (BA11). When the direction of switching was considered, forward switching (from L1 to L2), but not backward switching (from L2 to L1), activated several brain regions related to executive functions (i.e., bilateral frontal cortices and left ACC) relative to non-switching conditions. These results suggest that neural correlates of language switching differ depending on the direction of the switch and that there does not seem to be a specific brain area acting as a \"language switch\".",

In this study, the emotional faces suitable for Chinese subjects were selected as the stimuli. fMRI results showed that for happy faces, the normal group showed activation in left prefrontal cortex, while the patients showed activation in right prefrontal cortex. For the sad condition, the normal group showed activation in bilateral prefrontal cortex, while the patient group showed activation in bilateral inferior temporal gyrus. Moreover, compared with the control group, the patients showed decreased activation in both magnitude and extent in bilateral triangle area of Inferior Frontal Gyrus, right orbital of area Inferior Frontal Gyrus, and Inferior Temporal Gyrus. This was more exaggerated for the sad condition. These results indicate that unipolar depressed patients may have not only functional abnormalities in emotion-related areas, but also brain area changes in emotion processing.",

Poor segmentation tools of hippocampal subfields, however, have hindered our understanding of their specific roles. Using FreeSurfer 6.0, which provides more accurate segmentation than previous versions (especially for Cornu Ammonis [CA] subfields), the current study examined the 12 hippocampal subfieldsu0027 contributions to fluid intelligence (measured with Ravenu0027s Advanced Progressive Matrices, RAPM) and working memory (measured with n-back visual and verbal working memory tasks) in a sample of 417 healthy young adults. Results showed that RAPM and visual n-back working memory had similar correlations with hippocampal subfieldsu0027 volumes, but RAPM was more highly correlated with the volumes of the right hippocampus as well as three of its subfields (CA1, molecular layer of the hippocampus, and hippocampal tail) than was verbal n-back working memory (after correcting for multiple comparisons). In addition, sex moderated the correlation between left hippocampal fissure volume and n-back working memory. These results suggest both shared and distinct neural substrates for fluid intelligence and visual and verbal working memory, and highlight the role of CA1 in visuospatial cognition.",

Chinese college students ( N   =   436) participated in a misinformation study and received a battery of cognitive tasks and personality measures. Results showed that false memory was positively related to persistence, self-directedness, and active coping, but negatively related to depression, fear of negative evaluation, novelty seeking, negative coping, and cognitive abilities. Importantly, significant interaction effects were found between personality factors and cognitive abilities. Individuals with particular combinations of personality characteristics and cognitive abilities (i.e., low fear of negative evaluation, low harm avoidance, high cooperativeness, high reward dependence, and high self-directedness in combination with relatively low cognitive abilities) were more vulnerable to the misinformation effect.",

A total of 36 children (mean age = 5 years 10 months) were asked to perform physical size comparison (i.e., \"Which of two numbers is bigger in physical size?\") and numerical magnitude tasks (i.e., \"Which of two numbers is bigger in numerical magnitude?\") on 216 number pairs. These number pairs varied in levels of congruence between numerical magnitude and physical size (for Stroop effect) and numerical distance (for distance effect). On the basis of analyses of response time and error rates, we found that Chinese kindergartners showed automatic processing of numerical magnitude. These results are significantly different from previous studies' findings about the onset age (ranging from around the end of first grade to third grade) for automatic processing of numerical magnitude.",

        "abstract": "Focusing moving targets with frequency-domain algorithms may suffer from azimuth spectrum not entirely contained within a pulse-repetition frequency band, which may lead to degraded detection performance due to distributing the energy to the artifacts. In order to avoid this problem, a refocusing algorithm after back-projection integral is proposed. The main idea is first to uniformly and coarsely focus moving targets for detection, and then extract the detected targets for refocusing. By deriving the exact analytic expression of the wavenumber spectrum, motion parameter estimation and motion compensation are directly carried out on the 2-D wavenumber domain of the small-sized extracted data, which involves fast Fourier transform and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform operations only with no interpolation, thus reduces the computational complexity. Then, the final refocused image of the moving target is achieved. Refocusing results of both airborne and spaceborne synthetic aperture radar data are shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The arcuate fasciculus (AF) is a neural fiber tract that is critical to speech and music development. Although the predominant role of the left AF in speech development is relatively clear, how the AF engages in music development is not understood. Congenital amusia is a special neurodevelopmental condition, which not only affects musical pitch but also speech tone processing. Using diffusion tensor tractography, we aimed at understanding the role of AF in music and speech processing by examining the neural connectivity characteristics of the bilateral AF among thirty Mandarin amusics. Compared to age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched controls, amusics demonstrated increased connectivity as reflected by the increased fractional anisotropy in the right posterior AF but decreased connectivity as reflected by the decreased volume in the right anterior AF. Moreover, greater fractional anisotropy in the left direct AF was correlated with worse performance in speech tone perception among amusics. This study is the first to examine the neural connectivity of AF in the neurodevelopmental condition of amusia as a result of disrupted music pitch and speech tone processing. We found abnormal white matter structural connectivity in the right AF for the amusic individuals. Moreover, we demonstrated that the white matter microstructural properties of the left direct AF is modulated by lexical tone deficits among the amusic individuals. These data support the notion of distinctive pitch processing systems between music and speech.",

Vowel and tone identifications were examined among three groups of Mandarin-native listeners: tone agnosics (amusics with lexical tone deficits), the pure amusics (with normal lexical processing) and normal controls. Preliminary results showed that tone agnosics had the lowest scores in the identification of vowel-plus-tones, vowels, and tones, while the performances were similar between the pure amusics and normal controls.

A large sample of Chinese college students (N=436) participated in a misinformation procedure and also took a battery of cognitive tests. Results revealed sizable and systematic individual differences in false memory arising from exposure to misinformation. False memories were significantly and negatively correlated with measures of intelligence (measured with Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), perception (Motor-Free Visual Perception Test, Change Blindness, and Tone Discrimination), memory (Wechsler Memory Scales and 2-back Working Memory tasks), and face judgement (Face Recognition and Facial Expression Recognition). These findings suggest that people with relatively low intelligence and poor perceptual abilities might be more susceptible to the misinformation effect.",

With a delayed verification paradigm, 18 Chinese undergraduates were first asked to solve the arithmetic problems that were presented visually for 200 ms and, after 1.5 s, to judge whether a presented solution was correct or not. Results showed that, compared to addition and subtraction, multiplication elicited a greater N300 at the left frontal electrodes peaking around 320 ms (in the interval between 275 and 334 ms after the onset of the arithmetic problem). To control for the confounding effects of task difficulty and solution size, comparisons were further made between \"large\" addition problems (with sums between 11 and 17) and \"small\" multiplication problems (with products between 6 and 24). Similar results were obtained (i.e., a significant difference between addition and multiplication in the N300 component between 296 and 444 ms). Source analyses demonstrated that a single dipole in the left anterior brain areas could have contributed to the topographies of the difference waveforms (\"multiplication-addition\", \"multiplication-subtraction\", and \"'small' multiplication-'large' addition\"). These results are interpreted in terms of the greater reliance on phonological processing for the retrieval of multiplication facts than for the retrieval of addition and subtraction facts.",

The misinformation effect refers to the phenomenon that a person's recollection of a witnessed event can be altered after exposure to misleading information about the event. DRM false memory represents the intrusion of words that are semantically related but not actually presented in the study session. Subjects (N = 432) completed both misinformation and DRM false memory tests. Results showed a small but significant correlation (r = .12, p = .02) between the misinformation and DRM false memories. Furthermore, using signal detection theory, we found that the discrimination ability index (d') was related to both the misinformation and DRM false memories (r = -.12 and -.13, p = .01), while the response bias was related only to DRM false memory (r = -.46, p < .001). These results suggest that misinformation and DRM false memories generally involve different mechanisms and that their shared mechanism may involve the global discrimination ability.",

The present study was designed to determine the effect of HGF on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and to explore the combined effect of HGF and Ang II on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal rat hearts and cultured in vitro. Cells were treated with Ang II (1 µM) alone, HGF (10 ng/mL) alone, and Ang II (1 µM) plus HGF (10 ng/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h. The amount of [³H]-leucine incorporation was then measured to evaluate protein synthesis. The mRNA levels of β-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic factor were determined by real-time PCR to evaluate the presence of fetal phenotypes of gene expression. The cell size of cardiomyocytes was also studied. Ang II (1 µM) increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Similar to Ang II, treatment with 1 µM HGF promoted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, the combination of 1 µM Ang II and 10 ng/mL HGF clearly induced a combined pro-hypertrophy effect on cardiomyocytes. The present study demonstrates for the first time a novel, combined effect of HGF and Ang II in promoting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.",

In this position paper, we suggest to construct trustworthy and safe communities based on a BLockchain-Enabled Social credits System (BLESS) that rewards the residents who commit in socially beneficial activities. Human beingu0027s true value lies in serving other people. The BLESS system is considered as an efficient approach to promote the value and dignity in efforts focused on enhancing our communities and regulating business and private behaviors. The BLESS system leverages the decentralized architecture of the blockchain network, which not only allows grassroots individuals to participate rating process of a social credit system (SCS), but also provides tamper proof of transaction data in the trustless network environment. The anonymity in blockchain records also protects individuals from being targeted in the fight against powerful enterprises. Smart contract enabled authentication and authorization strategy prevents any unauthorized entity from accessing the credit system. The BLESS scheme is promising to offer a secure, transparent and decentralized SCS.",

        "abstract": "ZNF804A gene polymorphism rs1344706 has been suggested as the most compelling case of a candidate gene for schizophrenia by a genome-wide association study and several replication studies. The current study of 570 schizophrenia patients and 448 controls again found significantly different genotype frequencies of rs1344706 between patients and controls. More important, we found that this association was modulated by IQ, with a stronger association among individuals with relatively high IQ, which replicated results of Walters et al, 2010. We further examined whether this IQ-modulated association also existed between the SNP and the intermediate phenotypes (working memory and executive functions) of schizophrenia. Data were available from an N-back task (366 patients and 414 controls) and the attention network task (361 patients and 416 controls). We found that the SNP and IQ had significant interaction effects on the intermediate phenotypes for patients, but not for controls. The disease risk allele was associated with poorer cognitive function in patients with high IQ, but better cognitive function in patients with low IQ. Together, these results indicated that IQ may modulate the role of rs1344706 in the etiology of both schizophrenia and its cognitive impairments, and pointed to the necessity of considering general cognitive function as indexed by IQ in the future studies of genetic bases of schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested differential engagement of addressed and assembled phonologies in reading Chinese and alphabetic languages (e.g., English) and the modulatory role of native language in learning to read a second language. However, it is not clear whether native language experience shapes the neural mechanisms of addressed and assembled phonologies. To address this question, we trained native Chinese and native English speakers to read the same artificial language (based on Korean Hangul) either through addressed (i.e., whole-word mapping) or assembled (i.e., grapheme-to-phoneme mapping) phonology. We found that, for both native Chinese and native English speakers, addressed phonology relied on the regions in the ventral pathway, whereas assembled phonology depended on the regions in the dorsal pathway. More importantly, we found that the neural mechanisms of addressed and assembled phonologies were shaped by native language experience. Specifically, one key region for addressed phonology (i.e., the left middle temporal gyrus) showed greater activation for addressed phonology in native Chinese speakers, while one key region for assembled phonology (i.e., the left supramarginal gyrus) showed more activation for assembled phonology in native English speakers. These results provide direct neuroimaging evidence for the effect of native language experience on the neural mechanisms of phonological access in a new language and support the assimilation-accommodation hypothesis.",

Using mixed blocked and event-related designs, the present study explored the sustained and transient neural control of two languages during language processing. 15 Chinese-English bilingual speakers were scanned when they performed language switching tasks. The results showed that, compared to the single language condition, sustained bilingual control (mixed language condition) induced activation in the bilateral inferior frontal, middle prefrontal and frontal gyri (BA 45/46). In contrast, relative to the no switch condition, transient bilingual control (language switching condition) activated the left inferior parietal lobule (BA 2/40), superior parietal lobule (BA 7), and middle frontal gyrus (BA 11/46). Importantly, the right superior parietal activity correlated with the magnitude of the mixing cost, and the left inferior and superior parietal activity covaried with the magnitude of the asymmetric switching costs. These results suggest that sustained and transient language control induced differential lateral activation patterns, and that sustained and transient activities in the human brain modulate the behavioral costs during switching-related language control.",

To better hold the particles together, polymeric additives are utilized as binders, which not only increase the weight and volume of the devices, but also cause adverse side effects. We developed a wood-derived, free-standing porous carbon electrode and successfully applied it as a cathode in Li-O2 batteries. The spontaneously formed hierarchical porous structure exhibits good performance in facilitating the mass transport and hosting the discharge products of Li2O2. Heteroatom (N) doping further improves the catalytic activity of the carbon cathode with lower overpotential and higher capacity. Overall, the Li-O2 battery based on the new carbon cathode affords a stable energy efficiency of 65% and can be operated for 20 cycles at a discharge depth of 70%. The wood-derived free-standing carbon represents a new, unique structure for energy applications.",

Growth and properties of perovskite layer and its relationship to photovoltaic performance have been extensively studied. Comparably less attention was devoted to the research of the influence of electron transporting layer (ETL). Conventionally, TiO 2 is selected as ETL. However, photocatalytic property of this transparent conductive metal oxide reduces the stability of perovskite solar cells under illumination. To realize the comme rcialization, the stability of perovskite solar cell must be improved. In this study, we replace TiO 2 by In 2 O 3 , which is not only transparent and conductive, but also has little photocatalytic effect and it has higher electron mobility than TiO 2 . Investigation on different solution process methods of In 2 O 3 as ETL is demonstrated. Keywords: Perovskite, In 2 O 3 , electron transport layer 1.

        "abstract": "AIM: To observe the effect of cyclosporine A on intima hyperplasia of rat abdominal aortas injured by balloon.METHODS: Thirty-six healthy adult male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham group(n=12),balloon-injured group(n=12) and cyclosporine A treatment group(n=12).From the 3rd day before injury to the 30th day after injury,the rats in cyclosporine A treatment group were treated with cyclosporine A at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg everyday,while the rats in sham group and balloon-injured group were fed with the same volume of water.On the 30th day after injury,the specimens were obtained from the rats.HE staining and immunohistochemistry were used to measure the expression level of calcineurin(CaN) in arterial wall.Pathological changes of the arterial wall were observed under light microscope.The expression of CaN and nuclear factor 3 of activated T-cells(NFATc3) in the abdominal aortas was detected by the technique of real-time PCR.RESULTS: Intimal hyperplasia was observed in balloon-injured rats.The neointima was not uniform in thickness on the 30th day.The thickness of the intimal layers and the ratio of the intimal to the medial layers in cyclosporine A group were obviously lower than those in balloon group(P<0.05).Immunohistochemistry revealed that calcineurin expression increased after balloon injury,but the expression of calcineurin in cyclosporine A group was obviously decreased as compared with balloon group(P<0.05).The results of real-time PCR showed that the mRNA expression of calcineurin and NFATc3 in cyclosporine A group was significantly lower than that in balloon-injured group(P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Cyclosporine A attenuates restenosis by suppressing the CaN-NFATc signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "A theoretical framework about protective factors (models protection, controls protec-tion, support protection) and risk factors (models risk, opportunity risk, vulnerability risk) was employed to articulate the content of 4 key contexts of adolescent life, fam-ily, peers, school, and neighborhood, in a cross-national study of problem behavior among 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-grade adolescents in the United States (n = 1,596) and the People's Republic of China (n = 1,739). Results were very similar in both samples and across genders. Measures of protection and risk in each of the 4 contexts uniquely contributed to the account of problem behavior involvement even when individ-ual-level measures of protection and risk were controlled. Context protection was also shown to moderate individual-level risk and protection in 1 context moderated risk within that context and in other contexts. Controls protection, protection provided by rules, regulations, and expected sanctions for transgression from adults and peers, was the most important measure of context protection in all but 1 context. The family and peer contexts were the most influential in the U. S. sample, and the peer and school contexts were the most influential in the Chinese sample; the neighborhood context was least influential in both samples. ",

        "abstract": "To study the clinicopathological significance and relationship of Gli1, MDM2 and p53 expression in human pancreatic cancer.The expression of Gli1, MDM2 and p53 proteins in 57 paired paraffin embedded pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) specimens and adjacent non-cancerous pancreatic tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between their expression and clinicopathological characters was analyzed. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to examine the expression of Gli1 mRNA level in 14 paired fresh PDAC specimens and adjacent non-cancerous pancreatic tissues. siRNA interference were used to further detect the close relationship among them.IHC showed the expression of Gli1 (50.9%), MDM2 (57.9%) and p53 (56.1%) was increased in 57 cases of pancreatic cancer compared to that in paired normal pancreatic tissues (33.3%, 26.3% and 17.5% respectively, t = 2.413, 2.848 and 2.960, all P < 0.05). Gli1 expression was positively associated with tumor TNM stage (χ(2) = 8.211, P = 0.004), invasion depth (χ(2) = 4.247, P = 0.039) and MDM2 expression (r = 0.299, χ(2) = 5.105, P = 0.024), while expression of MDM2 and p53 was associated with tumor invasion depth (χ(2) = 5.182, P = 0.023) and TNM stage (χ(2) = 5.696, P = 0.017), respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that Gli1 was an independent adverse prognostic indicator for patients with PDAC (RR = 2.290, 95%CI: 1.051-4.992, P = 0.037), and patients with Gli1 and MDM2 co-expression had a significantly poorer overall survival than patients with their negative expression (P = 0.034). Gli1 mRNA expression was much higher in 14 cases of PDAC than that in adjacent normal pancreatic tissues (t = 2.926, P = 0.012). In p53 mutant AsPC-1 cells, Gli1 knockdown down regulated MDM2, but had no effect on p53 expression, whereas Gli1 knockdown down regulated MDM2 and up regulated p53 protein levels in p53 wild-type Capan-2 cells.Gli1, MDM2 and p53 are overexpressed in PDAC, and are benefit for predicting patients' prognosis. Gli1can regulate MDM2 and wild-type p53 expression. Their co-expression might coordinately contribute to the development and progression of PDAC.",

        "abstract": "Advanced noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as EEG and fMRI allow researchers to directly observe brain activities while subjects perform various perceptual, motor, and/or cognitive tasks. By combining functional brain imaging with sophisticated experimental designs and data analysis methods, functions of brain regions and their interactions can be examined. A nascent field called neuroeconomics has recently emerged as a result of the enormous success of applications of functional brain imaging techniques in the study of human decision-making. In this article, we first provide an overview of brain imaging techniques, focusing on the recent developments in multivariate analysis and multi-modal data integration. We then present several studies on risky decision making, intertemporal choice, and social decision making, to illustrate how neuroimaging techniques can be used to advance our knowledge on decision making. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions in neuroeconomics.",

The current study aimed at exploring whether the deficit in musical and/or tone processing also influenced frequency modulation (FM) detection. Thresholds of frequency modulation detection were examined among three Mandarin Chinese-native listeners groups: tone agnosics (amusics with deficits in lexical tone processing), pure amusics (with normal tone processing) and normal controls. Three acoustic parameters were manipulated: duration (250 and 500 ms), carrier frequency (250 and 1000 Hz), and modulation frequency (2, 8, and 32 Hz). Preliminary results showed that thresholds were higher for pure amusics and tone agnosics than for the control group in most conditions. Auditory model related to the musical and tonal processing for these listener groups will be discussed.",

Mothers of a subsample of adolescents (n = 405) also completed a questionnaire about their relationships with their adolescents.

Structural equation models revealed that 2 latent variables (family relationships and peer sanctions) accounted for more variance in misconduct among European and Chinese American adolescents (51%-62%) than among the 2 Chinese groups (15%-24%), mainly because of a greater contribution of peer factors in the former groups.",

        "abstract": " wilt that is caused by  does result in massive annual yield losses and fiber quality decline in cotton. Control by conventional mechanisms is not possible due to a wide host range and the longevity of dormant fungi in the soil in the case of absence of a suitable host. Plants have developed various mechanisms to boost their immunity against various diseases, and one is through the induction of various genes. In this research, we carried out RNA sequencing and then identified the members of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) proteins to be critical in enhancing resistance to  infection. A total of 166 proteins that are encoded by the  genes were identified in  with varying physiochemical properties. A novel  gene,  (ABCF5), was found to be highly upregulated, and its homolog in the tetraploid cotton  (ABCF5), was then silenced through virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) in , tetraploid upland cotton. The mutant cotton seedlings ability to tolerate  infection was significantly reduced. Based on the evaluation of oxidant enzymes, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and malondialdehyde (MDA) showed significantly increased levels in the leaves of the mutant compared to the wild type. In addition, antioxidant enzymes, peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentrations were reduced in the mutant cotton leaves after treatment with  fungi as compared to the wild type. Moreover, expression levels of the biotic stress genes, cotton polyamine oxidase (), cotton ribosomal protein L18 (), and cotton polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein-1 (), were all downregulated in the mutant but they were highly upregulated in the various tissues of the wild cotton seedlings. This research has shown that  genes could play an important role in enhancing the immunity of cotton to  infection, and thus can be explored in developing more resilient cotton genotypes with improved resistance to  infection in cotton.",

Much research has shown how native language affects the cognitive and neural mechanisms of a new language, but little is known about whether and how learning a new language shapes the neural mechanisms of prior language(s). In two experiments in the current study, we used an artificial language training paradigm in combination with an fMRI to examine (1) the effects of different linguistic components (phonology and semantics) of a new language on the neural process of prior languages (i.e., native and second languages), and (2) whether such effects were modulated by the proficiency level in the new language. Results of Experiment 1 showed that when the training in a new language involved semantics (as opposed to only visual forms and phonology), neural activity during word reading in the native language (Chinese) was reduced in several reading-related regions, including the left pars opercularis, pars triangularis, bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and inferior occipital gyrus. Results of Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1 and further found that semantic training also affected neural activity during word reading in the subjects׳ second language (English). Furthermore, we found that the effects of the new language were modulated by the subjects׳ proficiency level in the new language. These results provide critical imaging evidence for the influence of learning to read words in a new language on word reading in native and second languages.",

        "abstract": "Previous research suggests that within Mandarin-speaking congenital amusics, only a subgroup has behavioral lexical tone perception impairments (tone agnosia), whereas the rest of amusics do not. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the categorical nature of lexical tone perception in Mandarin-speaking amusics with and without behavioral lexical tone deficits. Three groups of listeners (controls, pure amusics, and amusics with tone agnosia) participated in tone identification and discrimination tasks. Indexes of the categorical perception (CP) of a physical continuum of fundamental frequencies ranging from a rising to level tone were measured. Specifically, the stimulus durations were manipulated at 100 and 200 ms. For both stimulus durations, all groups exhibited similar categorical boundaries. The pure amusics showed sharp identification slopes and significantly peaked discrimination functions similar to those of normal controls. However, such essential characteristics for the CP of lexical tones were not observed in amusics with tone agnosia. An enlarged step-size from 20 to 35 Hz was not able to produce any discrimination peaks in tone agnosics either. The current study revealed that only amusics with tone agnosia showed a lack of categorical tone perception, while the pure amusics demonstrated typical CP of lexical tones, indicating that the deficit of pitch processing in music does not necessarily result in the deficit in the CP of lexical tones. The different performance between congenital amusics with and without tone agnosia provides a new perspective on the proposition of the relationship between music and speech perception. ",

        "abstract": "Response inhibition refers to the suppression of inappropriate or irrelevant responses. It has a central role in executive functions, and has been linked to a wide spectrum of prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence from neuropharmacological studies has suggested that gene variants in the norepinephrine neurotransmission system make specific contributions to response inhibition. This study genotyped five tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms covering the whole alpha-2B-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2B) gene and investigated their associations with response inhibition in a relatively large healthy Chinese sample (N=421). The results revealed significant genetic effects of the ADRA2B conserved haplotype polymorphisms on response inhibition as measured by stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) (F(2, 418)=5.938, p=0.003). Individuals with the AAGG/AAGG genotype (n=89; mean SSRT=170.2 ms) had significantly shorter SSRTs than did those with either the CCAC/AAGG genotype (n=216; mean SSRT=182.4 ms; uncorrected p=0.03; corrected p=0.09) or the CCAC/CCAC genotype (n=116; mean SSRT=195.8 ms; corrected p<0.002, Cohen's d=0.51). This finding provides the first evidence from association research in support of a critical role of the norepinephrine neurotransmission system in response inhibition. A better understanding of the genetic basis of response inhibition would allow us to develop more effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of deficient or underdeveloped response inhibition as well as its related prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders.",

The pianists began their piano training at a mean age of 12. Voxel-based morphometry of the sMRI data showed that the pianists had higher GMD in the left primary sensorimotor cortex and right cerebellum. Voxel-based analysis of the DT-MRI data showed that pianists had higher fractional anisotropy (FA) (indicating higher WMI) in the right posterior limb of the internal capsule. The sMRI and DT-MRI results indicate that both the GMD and WMI of pianists may exhibit movement-related increases during adolescence or even early adulthood compared with non-musicians.",

The operation effects lasted from 250 to 900 ms for Arabic digits, but from 250 to 1400 ms for Chinese number words when participants were asked to respond only to false arithmetic equations (experiment one), and lasted from 350 to 1400 ms for Arabic digits and Chinese number words when participants were asked to respond to both true and false arithmetic equations (experiment two). The consistency in the operation effects in ERPs (i.e., a dissociation of brain organization for different arithmetic operations) for different number notations suggests that mental representation and retrieval of arithmetic facts may be relatively independent of numerical notations.",

        "abstract": "The SNP rs2958182 was reported to be significantly associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) in Han Chinese. This study examined this SNP's associations with cognitive functions in 580 SCZ patients and 498 controls. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-RC), the Attention Network Task (ANT), the Stroop task, the dot pattern expectancy (DPX), task and the N-back working memory task. Results showed significant or marginally significant interaction effects between genotype and diagnosis status on IQ (P=0.011) and attention-related tasks (ie, the forward digit span of WAIS-RC, P=0.005; the ANT conflict effect; P=0.020, and its ratios over mean reaction time (RT), P=0.036; the Stroop conflict effect, P=0.032, and its ratios over mean RT, P=0.062; and the DPX task's error rate under the BX condition, P<0.001, and the error rate of BX minus the error rate of AY (BX-AY), P=0.002). There were no such interaction effects on the measures of working memory (all P-values >0.05). Further analysis of the significant genotype-by-diagnosis interactions showed that the risk (T) allele was associated with better performance on cognitive tasks in patients but with worse performance in controls. These results seem to indicate that the association between this SNP and selected cognitive functions may be of an inverted U-shaped pattern. Future research is needed to replicate these results and to explore the biochemical mechanisms behind this association.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to investigate the lightning strike protection (LSP) effectiveness of expanded foils, the carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites with copper or aluminum expanded foil surface layers were subjected to standardized Waveform D (100 kA). The results demonstrated the excellent performance of the expanded foils in suppressing the heavy lightning strikes. Importantly, the damage morphology of post-lightning specimens indicated that the electrical conductivity of expanded foils was anisotropic, which was confirmed by numerical simulation. The anisotropic conductive expanded foils can highly enhance LSP effectiveness if their laying directions are optimally designed according to aircraft lightning zoning by SAE ARP 5414. Taking the expanded foil as an example, the study proposed a novel method to enhance LSP effectiveness for CFRP-based aircraft by optimally designing the laying directions of the LSP layers with anisotropic electrical conductivity.",

Despite lower prevalence of the problem behaviors in the Chinese sample, especially for girls, a substantial account of problem behavior is provided by the same protective and risk factors in both countries and for both genders. Protection is generally higher in the Chinese sample than in the U.S. sample, but in both samples protection also moderates the impact of risk. Despite mean differences in psychosocial protective and risk factors, as well as in problem behavior, in the 2 samples—differences that may reflect societal variation— the explanatory model has, to a large extent, cross-national generality.",

In this study, we expanded this previous work by investigating behavioral correlates of these SNPs in a Han Chinese sample (rs9320913 was not available in our data and was thus replaced by rs12202969, which is in high linkage disequilibrium [i.e., correlations of alleles] with the former,  r 2   =   0.96 in Han Chinese population based on the 1000 Genomes Project). Association analysis for individual SNPs showed significant associations between rs4851266 and a measure of language ability (Chinese word recognition), and between rs12202969 and a personality trait (fear of negative evaluation) and a measure of mathematical ability (number paired-associates learning). A polygenic score based on these three SNPs was also significantly associated with the measures of mathematical and language abilities. Specifically, educationally advantaged alleles identified in the previous study were associated with less fear of negative evaluation and higher mathematical and language abilities in the current study. This exploratory study provides evidence of psychological mechanisms for the association between genes and educational attainment.",

The strong coupling among theaerodynamics, the propulsion system and the flexibility effects makes the problem more challenging. Firstly, toreduce the complexity of the controller design, the FAHV model is transformed into three subsystems (velocitysubsystem, altitude and flight path angle subsystem, attack of angle and pitch rate subsystem). Secondly, basedon super-twisting algorithm, a novel finite time disturbance observer and an improved sliding mode controller aredesigned to ensure the finite time stability of each subsystem. The proposed disturbance observer can estimatethe uncertainty and the derivative of virtual control in finite time. Finally, simulation results are presentedto show the precision and rapidness in tracking the reference trajectory and validate the effectiveness of thedesigned controller.",

The current study examined sex differences between 50 Chinese males and 79 Chinese females in their fiber connections between the striatum and nine selected cortical and subcortical regions. Despite overall similarities, males showed stronger fiber connections between the left caudate and rostral cingulate cortex, between the right putamen and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, between the bilateral putamen and the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, and between the right caudate and the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, whereas females showed stronger fiber connections between the right putamen and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, between bilateral caudate and hippocampus, and between the left putamen and hippocampus. These findings help us to understand sex differences in the striatum-projected fiber connections and their implications for sex differences in behaviors.",

A recent animal study has suggested that NT antagonist administration impaired working memory in a learning task. The current study examined associations between NT genes and working memory among humans.Four hundred and sixty healthy undergraduate students were assessed with a 2-back working memory paradigm. 5 SNPs in the NTSR1 gene were genotyped. 5 ANOVA tests were conducted to examine whether and how working memory differed by NTSR1 genotype, with each SNP variant as the independent variable and the average accuracy on the working memory task as the dependent variable.ANOVA results suggested that two SNPs in the NTSR1 gene (rs4334545 and rs6090453) were significantly associated with working memory. These results survived corrections for multiple comparisons.Our results demonstrated that NTSR1 SNP polymorphisms were significantly associated with variance in working memory performance among healthy adults. This result extended previous rodent studies showing that the NT deficiency impairs the working memory function. Future research should replicate our findings and extend to an examination of other dopamine modulators.",

        "title": "Early Musical Training Contributes to Decision-Making Ability",
        "abstract": "Decision making is a complex process that involves weighing the probabilities of alternative options that can be desirable, undesirable, or neutral. Such a process necessarily involves both emotional responses and cognitive processes (Damasio, Everitt, u0026 Bishop, 1996; Li, Lu, Du0027Argembeau, Ng, u0026 Bechara, 2010). Indeed, previous studies have found that decision-making performance is associated with both emotion (Bajaj, Lamichhane, Adhikari, u0026 Dhamala, 2013; Choi, de Melo, Woo, u0026 Gratch, 2012; Furl, Gallagher, u0026 Averbeck, 2012; Mussel, Goritz, u0026 Hewig, 2013) and cognition (e.g., working memory [WM]; Dretsch u0026 Tipples, 2008; Kerr u0026 Zelazo, 2004; Remijnse, Nielen, Uylings, u0026 Veltman, 2005). Previous research has further distinguished two types of decision making based on the degree of uncertainty about the outcome: decisions under ambiguity are those without knowing the precise probability distribution of the possible outcomes, and decisions under risk are those with known outcome probabilities (Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, u0026 Anderson, 1994, Bechara, Damasio, u0026 Damasio, 2000; He et al., 2010; Stoltenberg u0026 Vandever, 2010). The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been widely used to assess decision making under both ambiguity and risk (Bechara et al., 1994, 2000; He et al., 2010). At the early stage of the IGT, players have little explicit knowledge about IGT alternatives, so they are making decisions under ambiguity. As the task progresses, players develop explicit knowledge of the risk profile across IGT alternatives, so they make decision knowing the risks (Brand, Recknor, Grabenhorst, u0026 Bechara, 2007; Upton, Bishara, Ahn, u0026 Stout, 2011).Musical training has been found to improve emotional processes such as emotion perception (Alluri et al., 2015) and understanding (Schellenberg u0026 Mankarious, 2012), as well as cognitive processes such as WM (George u0026 Coch, 2011; Hou et al., 2014). However, no study to date has examined whether musical training can influence decision-making ability. Given the positive effects of musical training on emotional and cognitive processes, the current study tested the hypothesis that musical training (especially early training) would be associated with better performance on the IGT. In addition, this study examined whether such effects were inde- pendent of training-related improvement in WM and/or emotion perception.Method and MaterialsParticipantsData for this study came from a larger project (e.g., Chen et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2014). Five hundred sixty-seven undergraduates at Beijing Normal University took the IGT test as well as other cognitive tests (see below for details). Based on their self-report (see below), 42 participants had early musical training (e.g., piano, keyboard, violin, and accordion) starting before the age of 7 years (11 males and 31 females; Table 1); 52 participants had late musical training (e.g., piano, keyboard, clarinet, and saxophone) starting after the age of 8 years (13 males and 39 females; see Table 1). From 473 participants who had no musical training, we selected 60 participants (12 males and 48 females; see Table 1) to match, roughly, the early and late musical training participants, in terms of age, gender, and IQ.MeasuresMusical training history. Participants were asked the age at which they started formal musical training, the types of musical instruments they used, and the number of years they had such formal training.The IGT. A computerized version of the IGT (Bechara et al., 2000; He et al., 2010) was used in the current study to assess decision making under ambiguity and risk (a screen shot is displayed in Figure 1). To motivate subjects, they were informed that the amount of their winning would be converted into real money. Participants were asked to select one card at a time (100 trials in total) from one of the four decks (labeled A, B, C, and D). As described in previous studies and the IGT manual (PAR, Inc, Lutz, FL), two of the decks were disadvantageous because they yielded high immediate gain but a greater loss in the long run (i. …",

The parameters of MCS/MPVA solutions such as viscosity and conductivity were measured to evaluate electrospinnability of the blend solutions. The bicomponent nanofibrous scaffolds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. SEM results indicated that MCS/MPVA weight ratios significantly influenced the morphology and diameter distribution of the nanofibers. XRD and DSC investigated that there was strong interaction caused by hydrogen bonding between molecular chain of MCS and MPVA. Water stability test confirmed that the photocrosslinked matrix with a MCS/MPVA ratio of 10/90 retained excellent integrity of the fibrous structure in water. The in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation revealed that photocrosslinked nanofibrous scaffolds entailed good cellular compatibility, and could be used as potential wound dressing.",

Numerous two-dimensional (2-D) image interpolation operations are utilized to raise accuracy. In this letter, a new factorized backprojection algorithm is proposed where no interpolation is involved. Coarse images are reconstructed and fused precisely in Cartesian coordinates. A spectrum compression method is introduced to decrease the Nyquist sampling requirement in cross-range direction for efficiency. Simulation and real-data experiments prove the validity and superiority of the proposal.",

        "abstract": "Efficient utility of radio spectrum has been a hot topic as the wireless communication spectrum is a precious resource. The past decade has witnessed intensive research in spectrum sharing techniques. Most of the techniques are based on cognitive radio networks (CRNs) because cognitive capabilities are essential for optimizing spectrum efficiency and guaranteeing safe coexistence in the presence of the spectrum uncertainty. However, due to the high complexity of the problem, most research has been limited to theoretical analysis. It is non-trivial to build a simulator that is capable of carrying out a comprehensive experimental study. In this paper, a survey is conducted to provide a big picture of the available simulators in CRNs research. By illustrating their major functionalities, the insight enables researchers to select tools that match their needs. In addition, with a better understanding of the advantages and constraints, this survey aims at providing a guideline for simulator designers who have been trying to meet the requirements from the CRN research community.",

Two experiments were conducted to examine the distance, magnitude, and SNARC effects in a number-matching task involving two-digit numbers. Forty undergraduates were asked to judge whether two two-digit numbers (presented serially in Experiment 1 and simultaneously in Experiment 2) were the same or not. Results showed that, when numbers were presented serially, unit digits did not make unique contributions to the magnitude and distance effects, supporting the holistic model. When numbers were presented simultaneously, unit digits made unique contributions, supporting the compositional model. The SNARC (Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes) effect was evident for the whole numbers and the decade digits, but not for the unit digits in both experiments, which indicates that two-digit numbers are represented on one mental number line. Taken together, these results suggested that the representation of two-digit numbers is on a single mental number line, but it depends on the stage of processing whether they are processed holistically or compositionally.",

        "abstract": "The association/dissociation of pitch processing between music and language is a long lasting debate. We examined this music-language relationship by investigating to what extent pitch deficits in these two domains were dissociable. We focused on a special neurodevelopmental pitch disorder-congenital amusia, which primarily affects musical pitch processing. Recent research has also revealed lexical tone deficits in speech among amusics. Approximately one-third of Mandarin amusics exhibits behavioural difficulties in lexical tone perception, which is known as tone agnosia. Using mismatch negativities (MMNs), our current work probed lexical tone encoding at the pre-attentive level among the Mandarin amusics with (tone agnosics) and without (pure amusics) behavioural lexical tone deficits compared with age- and IQ-matched controls. Relative to the controls and the pure amusics, the tone agnosics exhibited reduced MMNs specifically in response to lexical tone changes. Their tone-consonant MMNs were intact and similar to those of the other two groups. Moreover, the tone MMN reduction over the left hemisphere was tightly linked to behavioural insensitivity to lexical tone changes. The current study thus provides the first psychophysiological evidence of subgroup differences in lexical tone processing among Mandarin amusics and links amusics' behavioural tone deficits to impaired pre-attentive tone processing. Despite the overall music pitch deficits, the subgroup differences in lexical tone processing in Mandarin-speaking amusics suggest dissociation of pitch deficits between music and speech.",

However, little is known about how these mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here, we report the identification of a RNA giant nuclear body (RNA-GNB) that is abundant in cancer cells but rare in normal cells. The RNA-GNB contains a RNA core surrounded by a protein shell. We identify 782 proteins from cancer-associated RNA-GNBs, 40% of which are involved in the nuclear mRNA trafficking. RNA-GNB is required for cell proliferation, and its abundance is positively associated with tumor burden and outcome of therapies. Our findings suggest that the RNA-GNB is a novel nuclear RNA trafficking organelle that may contribute to the nuclear mRNA exporting and proliferation of cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "The ability to form durable memory is critical for human survival and development, but its underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms have not been well understood. In particular, existing studies have not clearly dissociated the neural processes supporting short- and long-duration memories. The present study addressed this issue with functional MRI and a modified subsequent memory paradigm. Participants were asked to make semantic judgment on a list of 320 words in the scanner. Half of the words were tested after a short delay (i.e., 1day, T1) and again after a long delay (i.e., 1week, T12), whereas the other half were tested only once after the long delay (T2). Materials forgotten during T1 were categorized as forgotten trials, and those remembered during T2 were categorized as long-duration trials. In contrast, trials remembered during T1 but not during T12 were categorized as short-duration trials. We found that compared to forgotten trials, short-duration trials showed decreased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus, which is consistent with many previous observations. Importantly, long-duration trials showed stronger activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) but less deactivation in the PCC relative to short-duration trials. Psychophysiological interactions (PPI) analysis revealed stronger functional connectivity between LIFG and PCC for long-duration trials than for forgotten trials. Our results suggest that strong PCC activity, in combination with strong LIFG activity, supports long-lasting memory.",

They represent an important class of materials ranging from single-atom catalysts (SACs) and nanoparticles (NPs). While SACs and NPs have been extensively reported, catalysts featuring a few atoms with well-defined structures are poorly studied. The difficulty in synthesizing such structures has been a critical challenge. Here we report a facile photochemical method that produces catalytic centers consisting of two Ir metal cations, bridged by O and stably bound to a support. Direct evidence unambiguously supporting the dinuclear nature of the catalysts anchored on α-FeO is obtained by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM). Experimental and computational results further reveal that the threefold hollow binding sites on the OH-terminated surface of α-FeO anchor the catalysts to provide outstanding stability against detachment or aggregation. The resulting catalysts exhibit high activities toward HO photooxidation.",

        "abstract": "Cotton ( spp.) is the number one crop cultivated for fiber production and the cornerstone of the textile industry. Drought and salt stress are the major abiotic stresses, which can have a huge economic impact on cotton production; this has been aggravated with continued climate change, and compounded by pollution. Various survival strategies evolved by plants include the induction of various stress responsive genes, such as cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). In this study, we performed a whole-genome identification and analysis of the  gene family in cotton. We identified 31, 12, and 15  genes in , , and  respectively, and they were classified into 6 groups.  genes were distributed in 15, 10, and 9 linkage groups of AD, D, and A genomes, respectively. Evolutionary analysis revealed that segmental types of gene duplication were the primary force underlying  genes expansion. RNA sequence and RT-qPCR validation revealed that  was strongly induced by drought and salt stresses. The transient expression of Gh_D12G2017-GFP fusion protein in the protoplast showed that  was localized in the nucleus. The transgenic Arabidopsis lines exhibited higher concentration levels of the antioxidant enzymes measured, including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) concentrations under drought and salt stress conditions with very low levels of oxidants. Moreover, cell membrane stability (CMS), excised leaf water loss (ELWL), saturated leaf weight (SLW), and chlorophyll content measurements showed that the transgenic Arabidopsis lines were highly tolerant to either of the stress factors compared to their wild types. Moreover, the expression of the stress-related genes was also significantly up-regulated in  transgenic Arabidopsis plants under drought and salt conditions. We infer that CDKF-4s and CDKG-2s might be the primary regulators of salt and drought responses in cotton.",

Tumor cell viability, apoptosis, and invasion assays were used to investigate the effect of AZ on pancreatic cancer cells.Expression of CAI and p53 was increased in pancreatic cancer than that in paired non-cancerous tissues (P = 0.021; P = 0.007), whereas CAII was down-regulated in pancreatic cancer (P = 0.001). CAI overexpression was associated with tumor differentiation and negatively with vascular invasion (P = 0.015 and P = 0.018, respectively), while overexpression of CAII was associated with tumor differentiation (P = 0.017) and a better prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients (P = 0.017), and was an independent prognostic indicator (P = 0.011). p53 overexpression was related with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.032) and TNM stage (P = 0.016).

Results showed that both addition and multiplication were supported by a broad neural system that involved regions within SMA, precentral gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, occipital gyri, superior temporal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus, as well as some subcortical structures. Nevertheless, addition problems elicited more activation in the intraparietal sulcus and middle occipital gyri at the right hemisphere, and superior occipital gyri at both hemispheres, whereas multiplication had more activation in precentral gyrus, supplementary motor areas, and posterior and anterior superior temporal gyrus at the left hemisphere. This pattern of dissociated activation supports our hypothesis that addition has greater reliance on visuospatial processing and multiplication on verbal processing.",

In this study, we explored the associations between these and three additional SNPs in S100B and prefrontal functions (working memory and executive control) among 434 schizophrenia patients and 412 healthy controls. Results showed that, for both schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, two SNPs were significantly associated with prefrontal functions in the spatial domain (P value threshold was set at 0.014 after correcting for multiple comparisons), with the AA genotype of rs9722 and the GG genotype of rs2839357 linked to poorer performance. No SNP was associated with prefontal functions in the verbal domain (all Ps >0.05). These results extend our previous study and further confirm the important roles of the S100B gene in spatial abilities.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to establish an HPLC method for simultaneous determination of gastrodin and eight nucleosides and nucleobases components in Gastrodia elata. The separation was carried out on an Agilent Zorbax Bonus-RP (4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5 μm) column with a methanol-(0.04% acetic acid) water solution gradient elution program at a flow rate of 1.0 mL x min(-1). The column temperature was 36 degrees C, and the detection wavelength was 254 nm. The volume of injection was 20 μL. The nine components including gastrodin, cytosine, uracil, cytosine, adenine, thymine, uridine, guanosine and adenosine were well separated. The calibration curve was well linear in the range of 2.04-262.00 mg x L(-1), 0.20-24.67 mg x L(-1), 0.18-23.75 mg x L(-1), 0.20-25.83 mg x L(-1), 0.20-26.67 mg x L(-1), 0.16-20.00 mg x L(-1), 0.22-27.71 mg x L(-1), 0.20-24.29 mg x L(-1), 0.24-30.58 mg x L(-1), respectively, and the correlation coefficient was between 0.998 9-0.999 9. The average recovery of gastrodin and eight nucleosides and nucleobases were 96.4%-99.6%, RSD less than 2.7% (n = 6). The contents of gastrodin in all the seven Tibet cultured Gastrodia elata samples were over 2 mg x g(-1). Further, all samples contain higher contents of adenosine, guanosine, uridine and cytidine compared to low contents of cytosine, uracil, adenine and thymine. The established method is accurate, reproducible and suitable for the determination of gastrodin and eight nucleosides and nucleobases comppnents in Gastrodia elata.",

        "abstract": "Decision making ability has been reported to be impaired in schizophrenia patients, but no research has examined the genetic bases of this impairment. This study investigated how decision making was affected by the genetic variants in the serotonin transporter gene (triallelic 5- HTTLPR) and serotonin receptor 1A gene (rs6295) and their interaction in 465 schizophrenia patients and 448 healthy controls. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was used to evaluate decision making under ambiguity (the first 40 trials) and decision making under risk (the last 60 trials). Results showed that, among the patients, the main effects of 5- HTTLPR (F(2) (,16) = 6.54, P = 0.002) and HTR1A rs6295 (F(2) (,16) = 3.87, P = 0.021) polymorphisms and their interaction effect (F(4) (,16) = 3.32, P = 0.005) were significant for the first 40 trials, with the GG genotype of HTR1A rs6295, the L'L' genotype of 5- HTTLPR and the GG-L'L' combination showing poorer IGT performance than their counterparts. Results for the healthy controls showed a similar pattern but did not reach statistical significance. No significant effects were found for the last 60 trials. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of decision making in schizophrenia patients as well as healthy adults.",

Previous research has identified the cathode chemistry as a major challenge that must be addressed for further development of Mg-based batteries. In response to this challenge, here we show Br2-based conversion chemistry is a potential route toward rechargeable Mg-batteries. Compared with Mg-ion or Mg-air chemistries, the Mg-Br2 system features fast kinetics and good cyclability. To solve the issues of poor electrolyte stability, a non-aqueous, dual-electrolyte scheme was employed for this proof-of-concept demonstration. The anolyte consisted of Mg(TFSI)2 dissolved in a monoglyme and diglyme mixture. The catholyte was composed of Mg(TFSI)2 in PYR14TFSI ionic liquid mixed with active bromine species. When Mg was used as the anode, an open circuit voltage of 3.0 V (vs. Mg2+/Mg) was measured. The prototypical cell was successfully discharged and charged for over 20 cycles with consistently high coulombic efficiencies (ca. 96%).",

The present study aimed to reveal possible gene-environment interactions on decision making in a large healthy sample. Specifically, we examined how the frequently studied COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism interacted with an environmental risk factor (i.e., stressful life events) and a protective factor (i.e., parental warmth) to influence affective decision making as measured by the Iowa Gambling Task. We found that stressful life events acted as a risk factor for poor IGT performance (i.e., high reward sensitivity) among Met carriers, whereas parental warmth acted as a protective factor for good IGT performance (i.e., higher IGT score) among Val/Val homozygotes. These results shed some new light on gene-environment interactions in decision making, which could potentially help us understand the underlying etiology of several psychiatric disorders associated with decision making impairment.",

        "abstract": "Alcohol use is highly heritable and has been associated with many gene variants, including those related to dopamine (DA). However, single gene association studies have shown inconsistent and small effects. Using a system-level approach, the current study aimed to estimate the overall effect of genetic variations in the DA system on alcohol use among male drinkers. One hundred seventy-six male college students who reported to have ever drunk alcohol were enrolled. Alcohol use was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Ninety-eight representative polymorphisms in all major DA neurotransmitter genes were genotyped. Using analysis of variance, we identified six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s that made statistically significant contributions to alcohol use. Next, main effects and interactions of these SNPs were assessed using multiple regression. The final model accounted for approximately 20% of the variance for alcohol use. Finally, permutation analyses ascertained the probability of obtaining these findings by chance to be low, p ranging from 0.024 to 0.048. These results confirmed that DA-related gene variants made strong contributions to reported alcohol use and suggest that multiple regression can be a promising way to explore the genetic basis for multi-gene-determined human behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive radio network (CRN) has been considered as the most promising solution for an efficient usage of wireless communication spectrum resource as the pervasive utility of Internet of Things (IoT) and other smart mobile devices. Such cognitive capabilities collectively define the intelligence of CRNs. While the capability of cognition and the intelligence are vital for CRNs, the quantitative study is largely an open area. Because of the structural complexity and the nature of multidisciplinary, there is not a theoretically reasonable method to evaluate the “effectiveness” and “intelligence” of cognitive radio models. In contrast, the human intelligence quotient (IQ) test provides a straightforward quantitative description of a person’s capability in conducting certain types of tasks like logical thinking. Inspired by the well-known Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory for human cognitive ability evaluation, in this paper a theoretical framework is proposed trying to apply the CHC model on cognitive radios. What this paper reports is the preliminary effort to lay down a theoretical framework for general cognition evaluation of cognitive radio or CRNs. By sharing the early stage conceptual idea with the colleagues in the smart cities community, we hope it will inspire more insightful discussions to accelerate the research in this important area.",

        "abstract": " gene has been repeatedly reported as a schizophrenia risk gene in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A polymorphism (rs1625579) at the  gene has been associated with both neural activation and behavioral performance during a working memory task. This study examined 's associations with task-related (N-back working memory) fMRI, resting state fMRI, and diffusion tensor images (DTI) data in 177 healthy adults. We found less deactivation of the PCC in risk allele homozygotes (TT) as compared to the GT heterozygotes (cluster size = 630 voxels, cluster level  < 0.001) during the N-back task, which replicated previous findings. Using the identified cluster within the PCC as the seed, we further found decreased functional connectivity between the PCC and the anterior cingulate cortex and its adjacent medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/MPFC) in risk allele homozygotes during both resting state (cluster size = 427 voxels, cluster level  = 0.001) and the N-back task (cluster size = 73 voxels, cluster level  = 0.05). Finally, an analysis of our DTI data showed decreased white matter integrity of the posterior cingulum in risk allele homozygotes (cluster size = 214 voxels, cluster level  = 0.03). Taken together, rs1625579 seems to play an important role in both functional and structural connectivity between the PCC and the ACC/MPFC, which may serve as the brain mechanisms for the link between rs1625579 and schizophrenia.",

To improve their reliability and availability values of complex redundant systems, lots of dynamic gates are used, such as Priority AND (PAND) Gate, Spare Gate, Sequence Enforcing (SEQ) Gate and Functional Dependency (FDEP) Gate. And dynamic fault tree developed on the basis of Markov chain is applied. In order to reduce calculation and avoid finding minimal cut set, dynamic Bayesian network is introduced. And then methods to convert dynamic fault tree events into corresponding Bayesian network nodes are put forward and conditional probability tables are determined by domain experts and logic relations between nodes. At last, an aviation electric system is taken for example. According to its dynamic fault tree model, dynamic Bayesian network model is established, and expanded from the first time slice to the second time slice. The results show that the reliability of aviation electric system decreases gradually when there is no repair. And it will maintain at a high level when repair measures are taken. Through importance analysis, weak nodes in design are pointed out.",

Although they performed less well in L2 in the semantic decision task administered during fMRI measurement, these subjects showed similar robust activation, for both languages, in brain areas involved in semantic processing (e.g. the left inferior frontal cortex). Within-subject and group analyses revealed no significant difference in the activation patterns for L1 and L2 in these regions. These results suggest that at least at single-word level, there are shared neural substrates for semantic processing of L1 and L2 even when one is at a very low L2 proficiency level.",

        "abstract": "There is a keen interest in identifying specific brain regions that are related to individual differences in true and false memories. Previous functional neuroimaging studies showed that activities in the hippocampus, right fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus were associated with true and false memories, but no study thus far has examined whether the structures of these brain regions are associated with short-term and long-term true and false memories. To address that question, the current study analyzed data from 205 healthy young adults, who had valid data from both structural brain imaging and a misinformation task. In the misinformation task, subjects saw the crime scenarios, received misinformation, and took memory tests about the crimes an hour later and again after 1.5 years. Results showed that bilateral hippocampal volume was associated with short-term true and false memories, whereas right fusiform gyrus volume and surface area were associated with long-term true and false memories. This study provides the first evidence for the structural neural bases of individual differences in short-term and long-term true and false memories.",

        "abstract": "We identified 672, 374, and 379  proteins encoded by the  genes in   , and  , respectively. The genes were found to be distributed in all 26 chromosomes of the tetraploid cotton, with chrA05, chrA12, and their homeolog chromosomes harboring the highest number of genes. The physiochemical properties of the proteins encoded by the  genes varied in terms of their protein lengths, molecular weight, isoelectric points (pI), and even grand hydropathy values (GRAVY). However, over 99% of the cotton proteins had GRAVY values below 0, which indicated that the majority of the proteins encoded by the  genes were hydrophilic in nature, a common property of proteins encoded by stress-responsive genes. Moreover, through the RNA interference (RNAi) technique, the expression levels of  and  were suppressed, and the silenced plants showed a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) with a significant reduction in the concentration levels of glutathione (GSH), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and proline compared to the wild types under drought and salt stress conditions. Furthermore, the stress-responsive genes 1-Pyrroline⁻5-Carboxylate Synthetase ( superoxide dismutase (), and myeloblastosis ( were downregulated in VIGS plants, but showed upregulation in the leaf tissues of the wild types under drought and salt stress conditions. In addition, -silenced cotton plants exhibited a high level of oxidative injury due to high levels of oxidant enzymes, in addition to negative effects on CMS, ELWL, RLWC, and chlorophyll content The results provide the basic foundation for future exploration of the proteins encoded by the  genes in order to understand the physiological and biochemical mechanisms in enhancing drought and salt stress tolerance in plants.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary models of episodic memory posit that remembering involves the reenactment of encoding processes. Although encoding-retrieval similarity has been consistently reported and linked to memory success, the nature of neural pattern reinstatement is poorly understood. Using high-resolution fMRI on human subjects, our results obtained clear evidence for item-specific pattern reinstatement in the frontoparietal cortex, even when the encoding-retrieval pairs shared no perceptual similarity. No item-specific pattern reinstatement was found in the ventral visual cortex. Importantly, the brain regions and voxels carrying item-specific representation differed significantly between encoding and retrieval, and the item specificity for encoding-retrieval similarity was smaller than that for encoding or retrieval, suggesting different nature of representations between encoding and retrieval. Moreover, cross-region representational similarity analysis suggests that the encoded representation in the ventral visual cortex was reinstated in the frontoparietal cortex during retrieval. Together, these results suggest that, in addition to reinstatement of the originally encoded pattern in the brain regions that perform encoding processes, retrieval may also involve the reinstatement of a transformed representation of the encoded information. These results emphasize the constructive nature of memory retrieval that helps to serve important adaptive functions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Episodic memory enables humans to vividly reexperience past events, yet how this is achieved at the neural level is barely understood. A long-standing hypothesis posits that memory retrieval involves the faithful reinstatement of encoding-related activity. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the neural representations during encoding and retrieval. We found strong pattern reinstatement in the frontoparietal cortex, but not in the ventral visual cortex, that represents visual details. Critically, even within the same brain regions, the nature of representation during retrieval was qualitatively different from that during encoding. These results suggest that memory retrieval is not a faithful replay of past event but rather involves additional constructive processes to serve adaptive functions.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous catalysts with atomically defined active centers hold great promise for high-performance applications. Among them, catalysts featuring active moieties with more than one metal atom are important for chemical reactions that require synergistic effects but are rarer than single atom catalysts (SACs). The difficulty in synthesizing such catalysts has been a key challenge. Recent progress in preparing dinuclear heterogeneous catalysts (DHCs) from homogeneous molecular precursors has provided an effective route to address this challenge. Nevertheless, only side-on bound DHCs, where both metal atoms are affixed to the supporting substrate, have been reported. The competing end-on binding mode, where only one metal atom is attached to the substrate and the other metal atom is dangling, has been missing. Here, we report the first observation that end-on binding is indeed possible for Ir DHCs supported on WO. Unambiguous evidence supporting the binding mode was obtained by  diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. Density functional theory calculations provide additional support for the binding mode, as well as insights into how end-on bound DHCs may be beneficial for solar water oxidation reactions. The results have important implications for future studies of highly effective heterogeneous catalysts for complex chemical reactions.",

        "abstract": "Recognising detailed facial or clothing attributes in images of people is a challenging task for computer vision, especially when the training data are both in very large scale and extremely imbalanced among different attribute classes. To address this problem, we formulate a novel scheme for batch incremental hard sample mining of minority attribute classes from imbalanced large scale training data. We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework capable of avoiding the dominant effect of majority classes by discovering sparsely sampled boundaries of minority classes. This is made possible by introducing a Class Rectification Loss (CRL) regularising algorithm. We demonstrate the advantages and scalability of CRL over existing state-of-the-art attribute recognition and imbalanced data learning models on two large scale imbalanced benchmark datasets, the CelebA facial attribute dataset and the X-Domain clothing attribute dataset.",

        "abstract": "Both genetic and environmental factors have been shown to influence decision making, but their relative contributions and interactions are not well understood. The present study aimed to reveal possible gene-environment interactions on decision making in a large healthy sample. Specifically, we examined how the frequently studied COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism interacted with an environmental risk factor (i.e., stressful life events) and a protective factor (i.e., parental warmth) to influence affective decision making as measured by the Iowa Gambling Task. We found that stressful life events acted as a risk factor for poor IGT performance (i.e., high reward sensitivity) among Met carriers, whereas parental warmth acted as a protective factor for good IGT performance (i.e., higher IGT score) among Val/Val homozygotes. These results shed some new light on gene-environment interactions in decision making, which could potentially help us understand the underlying etiology of several psychiatric disorders associated with decision making impairment.",

        "abstract": "The left midfusiform and adjacent regions have been implicated in processing and memorizing familiar words, yet its role in memorizing novel characters has not been well understood.Using functional MRI, the present study examined the hypothesis that the left midfusiform is also involved in memorizing novel characters and spaced learning could enhance the memory by enhancing the left midfusiform activity during learning. Nineteen native Chinese readers were scanned while memorizing the visual form of 120 Korean characters that were novel to the subjects. Each character was repeated four times during learning. Repetition suppression was manipulated by using two different repetition schedules: massed learning and spaced learning, pseudo-randomly mixed within the same scanning session. Under the massed learning condition, the four repetitions were consecutive (with a jittered inter-repetition interval to improve the design efficiency). Under the spaced learning condition, the four repetitions were interleaved with a minimal inter-repetition lag of 6 stimuli. Spaced learning significantly improved participants' performance during the recognition memory test administered one hour after the scan. Stronger left midfusiform and inferior temporal gyrus activities during learning (summed across four repetitions) were associated with better memory of the characters, based on both within- and cross-subjects analyses. Compared to massed learning, spaced learning significantly reduced neural repetition suppression and increased the overall activities in these regions, which were associated with better memory for novel characters.These results demonstrated a strong link between cortical activity in the left midfusiform and memory for novel characters, and thus challenge the visual word form area (VWFA) hypothesis. Our results also shed light on the neural mechanisms of the spacing effect in memorizing novel characters.",

As expected, native listeners outperformed non-native listeners. The two non-native groups had similar performance in quiet, whereas CNU listeners performed significantly better than Chinese in China listeners in babble. It is concluded that CNU listeners may benefit from English experience, for example, better use of temporal variation in noise and better capacity against informational masking, to perceive English consonants better in babble. Possible explanations regarding the differential noise effect on the three groups are discussed.",

However, recent studies have suggested that the effects of 5-HTTLPR may be specific to different ethnic groups. Few studies have been conducted to address this issue.Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted on thirty-eight healthy Han Chinese subjects (l/l group, n = 19; s/s group, n = 19) during the resting state and during an emotional processing task. Compared with the s/s group, the l/l group showed significantly increased regional homogeneity or local synchronization in the right amygdala during the resting state (|t|>2.028, p<0.05, corrected), but no significant difference was found in the bilateral amygdala in response to negative stimuli in the emotional processing task.5-HTTLPR can alter the spontaneous activity of the amygdala in Han Chinese. However, the effect of 5-HTTLPR on the amygdala both in task state and resting state in Asian population was no similar with Caucasians. They suggest that the effect of 5-HTTLPR on the amygdala may be modulated by ethnic differences.",

        "abstract": "Hippocampal volume is a key brain structure for learning ability and memory process, and hippocampal atrophy is a recognized biological marker of Alzheimer's disease. However, the genetic bases of hippocampal volume are still unclear although it is a heritable trait. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on hippocampal volume have implicated several significantly associated genetic variants in Europeans. Here, to test the contributions of these GWASs identified genetic variants to hippocampal volume in different ethnic populations, we screened the GWAS-identified candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 3 independent healthy Asian brain imaging samples (a total of 990 subjects). The results showed that none of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with hippocampal volume in either individual or combined Asian samples. The replication results suggested a complexity of genetic architecture for hippocampal volume and potential genetic heterogeneity between different ethnic populations.",

        "abstract": "Previous research reported that a rare serotonin receptor 2B gene (HTR2B) stop codon mutation predisposes subjects to severe impulsivity and novelty seeking. In this study, we expanded this previous work by testing six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the HTR2B gene for potential associations with the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and the three components of the behavioral approach systems (BAS: fun seeking, drive, and reward responsiveness) in a Han Chinese sample (N= 478). Association analysis for individual SNPs indicated that four of the six SNPs (i.e., rs6437000, rs10194776, rs16827801, and rs1549339) were significantly associated with BAS fun seeking (p= 0003-0022). Haplotype-based association analysis revealed that fun seeking was positively associated with haplotype A-A-G-A for SNPs rs6437000- rs10194776- rs16827801- rs1549339 (p= 0002), which survived Bonferroni correction. Except for the association between BAS reward responsiveness and rs16827801 (p= 005), no other association was found for BAS drive, BAS reward responsiveness, or BIS. This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of the HTR2B gene in BAS fun seeking. A better understanding of the genetic basis of the BIS and BAS would allow us to develop more effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of impulsive behavioral problems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Potential relationships between the GABRB1 gene, thalamus volume, and intelligence have been suggested by previous clinical studies, but have not been directly examined among nonclinical samples. The current study collected structural MRI, genetic, and behavioral data from 316 healthy Chinese adults (including 187 females and 129 males), and examined associations between GABRB1 variants, thalamus volume, and intelligence (measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised). After controlling for intracranial volume, sex, and age, GABRB1 genetic polymorphism at the SNP rs7435958 had the strongest association with thalamus volume (p = 0.002 and 0.00008 for left and right thalamus volumes, respectively), with GG homozygotes having smaller bilateral thalamus volumes than the other genotypes. Furthermore, there were positive correlations between bilateral thalamus volumes and intelligence, especially for GABRB1 rs7435958 GG female homozygotes (r's = 0.31 and 0.29, p < 0.01, for the correlations of intelligence with left and right thalamus volumes, respectively). This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of the GABRB1 gene in the thalamus structure and their interactive effects on intelligence. Future studies of the thalamus-intelligence associations should consider genetic factors as potential moderators.",

        "abstract": "Verticillium wilt that is caused by Verticillium dahliae, does result in massive annual yield losses and fiber quality decline in cotton. Control by conventional mechanisms is not possible due to a wide host range and the longevity of dormant fungi in the soil in the case of absence of a suitable host. Plants have developed various mechanisms to boost their immunity against various diseases, and one is through the induction of various genes. In this research, we carried out RNA sequencing and then identified the members of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) proteins to be critical in enhancing resistance to V. dahliae infection. A total of 166 proteins that are encoded by the ABC genes were identified in Gossypium raimondii with varying physiochemical properties. A novel ABC gene, Gorai.007G244600 (ABCF5), was found to be highly upregulated, and its homolog in the tetraploid cotton Gh_D11G3432 (ABCF5), was then silenced through virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) in G. hirsutum, tetraploid upland cotton. The mutant cotton seedlings ability to tolerate V. dahliae infection was significantly reduced. Based on the evaluation of oxidant enzymes, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) showed significantly increased levels in the leaves of the mutant compared to the wild type. In addition, antioxidant enzymes, peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentrations were reduced in the mutant cotton leaves after treatment with V. dahliae fungi as compared to the wild type. Moreover, expression levels of the biotic stress genes, cotton polyamine oxidase (GhPAO), cotton ribosomal protein L18 (GhRPL18), and cotton polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein-1 (GhPGIP1), were all downregulated in the mutant but they were highly upregulated in the various tissues of the wild cotton seedlings. This research has shown that ABC genes could play an important role in enhancing the immunity of cotton to V. dahliae infection, and thus can be explored in developing more resilient cotton genotypes with improved resistance to V. dahliae infection in cotton.",

        "title": "Unbiased Age-Appropriate Structural Brain Atlases for Chinese Pediatrics",
        "abstract": "In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of children brain development, structural brain atlases usually serve as important references of pediatric population in which individual images are spatially normalized into a common or standard stereotactic space. However, the existing popular children brain atlases (e.g., National Institutes of Health pediatric atlases, NIH-PD atlases) are made mostly based on MR images from Western populations, and are thus insufficient to characterize the brains of Chinese children due to the neuroanatomical differences that are relevant to genetic and environmental factors. By collecting high-quality T1- and T2-weighted MR images from 328 typically developing Chinese children aged from 6 to 12 years old, we created a set of age-appropriate Chinese pediatric (CHN-PD) atlases using an unbiased iterative template construction algorithm. The CHN-PD atlases included the head/brain templates, the symmetric brain template, the gender-specific brain templates and the corresponding tissue probability atlases. Moreover, the atlases contained multiple age-specific templates with a one-year interval. A direct comparison of the CHN-PD and the NIH-PD atlases revealed remarkable anatomical differences bilaterally in the lateral frontal and parietal regions and somatosensory cortex. While applying the CHN-PD atlases to two independent Chinese pediatric datasets (N = 114 and N = 71, respectively), machine-learning regression approaches revealed higher prediction accuracy on brain ages than the usage of NIH-PD atlases. These results suggest that the CHN-PD brain atlases are necessary and important for future typical and atypical developmental studies in Chinese pediatric population. Currently, the CHN-PD atlases have been released on the NITRC website (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/chn-pd).",

        "abstract": "Traditional behavioral genetic studies (e.g., twin, adoption studies) have shown that human personality has moderate to high heritability, but recent molecular behavioral genetic studies have failed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) with consistent effects. The current study adopted a multi-step approach (ANOVA followed by multiple regression and permutation) to assess the cumulative effects of multiple QTLs. Using a system-level (dopamine system) genetic approach, we investigated a personality trait deeply rooted in the nervous system (the Highly Sensitive Personality, HSP). 480 healthy Chinese college students were given the HSP scale and genotyped for 98 representative polymorphisms in all major dopamine neurotransmitter genes. In addition, two environment factors (stressful life events and parental warmth) that have been implicated for their contributions to personality development were included to investigate their relative contributions as compared to genetic factors. In Step 1, using ANOVA, we identified 10 polymorphisms that made statistically significant contributions to HSP. In Step 2, these polymorphism's main effects and interactions were assessed using multiple regression. This model accounted for 15% of the variance of HSP (p<0.001). Recent stressful life events accounted for an additional 2% of the variance. Finally, permutation analyses ascertained the probability of obtaining these findings by chance to be very low, p ranging from 0.001 to 0.006. Dividing these loci by the subsystems of dopamine synthesis, degradation/transport, receptor and modulation, we found that the modulation and receptor subsystems made the most significant contribution to HSP. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of a multi-step neuronal system-level approach in assessing genetic contributions to individual differences in human behavior. It can potentially bridge the gap between the high heritability estimates based on traditional behavioral genetics and the lack of reproducible genetic effects observed currently from molecular genetic studies.",

        "abstract": "Music and speech share many sound attributes. Pitch, as the percept of fundamental frequency, often occupies the center of researchers’ attention in studies on the relationship between music and speech. One widely held assumption is that music experience may confer an advantage in speech tone processing. The cross-domain effects of musical training on non-tonal language speakers’ linguistic pitch processing have been relatively well established. However, it remains unclear whether musical experience improves the processing of lexical tone for native tone language speakers who actually use lexical tones in their daily communication. Using a passive oddball paradigm, the present study revealed that among Mandarin speakers, musicians demonstrated enlarged electrical responses to lexical tone changes as reflected by the increased mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitudes, as well as faster behavioral discrimination performance compared with age- and IQ-matched nonmusicians. The current results suggest that in spite of the preexisting long-term experience with lexical tones in both musicians and nonmusicians, musical experience can still modulate the cortical plasticity of linguistic tone processing and is associated with enhanced neural processing of speech tones. Our current results thus provide the first electrophysiological evidence supporting the notion that pitch expertise in the music domain may indeed be transferable to the speech domain even for native tone language speakers.",

        "abstract": "Compared with the original backprojection (BP) algorithm, the fast factorized BP algorithm accelerates enormously. As it is known to all, 2-D image interpolations are always utilized to raise the accuracy, yet leadings to the tradeoff with the efficiency. In this paper, a novel factorized BP algorithm based on Cartesian coordinate without interpolation, is proposed for high-resolution spotlight SAR with much better efficiency and accuracy. The innovative idea is achieved by establishing two spectrum compressing filters to decrease the cross-range Nyquist sampling rate enormously, thus avoid spectrum aliasing. The proposed algorithm, termed as the Cartesian factorized BP (CFBP) algorithm, can produce images with the similar quality as the BP does, but is better than FFBP, where the interpolations accumulate errors to some extent. The CFBP is designed for spotlight mode working in both the linear and curved trajectories. Simulation results and real-data processing validate the superiorities of CFBP by the comparisons with FFBP and the original BP individually.",

Previous imaging studies have revealed that the left temporoparietal cortex (LTPC) is associated with assembled phonology, the causal role of LTPC in assembled phonology and tDCSu0027s short- and long-term facilitation effect on reading via assembled phonology are not clear.    Methods  Two matched groups of native Chinese speakers received anodal tDCS either on LTPC or the visual cortex before they were trained to read an artificial language. All participants learned two sets of words, one through assembled phonology and the other through addressed phonology.    Results  We found that tDCS on LTPC specifically facilitated learning via assembled phonology, but not that via addressed phonology. Furthermore, the beneficial effect was still present four days later.    Conclusions  Repeated applications of tDCS at LTPC had long-term benefits on assembled phonology. These results have both theoretical and practical implications for learning to read.",

The controllers of velocity loop and altitude loop are designed separately based on the control-oriented model which is obtained by simplification of the FHV model. Itu0027s noted that the previous sliding mode control is sensitive to mismatched uncertainties, which weakens the use of sliding mode strategy. Therefore, the nested terminal sliding mode control is applied in FHV, to provide a virtual control in every step until the real control law is obtained, which can deal with the mismatched uncertainties problem and achieve finite-time stability. Whatu0027s more, the lumped uncertainties including the derivative of virtual control law are estimated by adaptive algorithm, which can solve the problem of “explosion of complex” and the upper bounds of uncertainties are not required to be known in advance. Simulation results show that the proposed control method can guarantee the accurate tracking of velocity and altitude effectively.",

        "title": "The operand-order effect in single-digit multiplication: an ERP study of Chinese adults.",
        "abstract": "Unlike those used in the West, a typical Chinese multiplication table includes only smaller-operand-first entries (e.g., 3 x 7=21, but not 7 x 3=21). Due to this unique feature, multiplication for Chinese subjects has been found to show an operand-order effect. The present study aims to investigate the neural bases of the operand-order effect. Subjects were 20 Mainland Chinese subjects who learned as children the half multiplication table (i.e., smaller-operand-first entries only) and 20 Hong Kong and Macao Chinese subjects who learned as children the whole multiplication table (i.e., both smaller- and larger-operand-first entries) under the British and Portuguese educational systems, respectively. ERP data showed that, for those who learned the half table (Mainland Chinese), but not for those who learned the whole table (Hong Kong and Macao Chinese), the larger-operand-first problems elicited greater negative potentials across representative electrodes of the whole scalp, emerging at about 120 ms after the onset of the second operand and lasting until around 750 ms. These results suggest that the particular experience of acquiring multiplication facts had pronounced impact on their representations in the brain.",
