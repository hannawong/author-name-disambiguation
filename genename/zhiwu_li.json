        "title": "Wavelet Frame-Based Fuzzy C-Means Clustering for Segmenting Images on Graphs.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, image processing in a Euclidean domain has been well studied. Practical problems in computer vision and geometric modeling involve image data defined in irregular domains, which can be modeled by huge graphs. In this paper, a wavelet frame-based fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm for segmenting images on graphs is presented. To enhance its robustness, images on graphs are first filtered by using spatial information. Since a real image usually exhibits sparse approximation under a tight wavelet frame system, feature spaces of images on graphs can be obtained. Combining the original and filtered feature sets, this paper uses the FCM algorithm for segmentation of images on graphs contaminated by noise of different intensities. Finally, some supporting numerical experiments and comparison with other FCM-related algorithms are provided. Experimental results reported for synthetic and real images on graphs demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient, and has a better ability for segmentation of images on graphs than other improved FCM algorithms existing in the literature. The approach can effectively remove noise and retain feature details of images on graphs. It offers a new avenue for segmenting images in irregular domains.",

        "abstract": "Environmentally friendly reliability-based product optimisation combining DANP, interval uncertainty and VIKOR is proposed.The proposed method conducts sufficient technical consideration of product environmental features.The organic combination of DANP with interval algorithms can handle the uncertainties and correlations among components.The organic integration of VIKOR can select the optimal reliability design scheme reasonably in the MCDM process.The superiority of the proposed method is verified by the case study of a waste tire shredder. With the far-reaching and overwhelming consequences resulting from energy crisis and carbon emissions, industrial products are required to be environmentally friendly, as well as of high quality and functionality. However, conventional reliability-based product optimisation methods cannot sufficiently ensure the environmental friendliness of modern industrial products. Firstly, the environmental features of a product are not considered. Secondly, the uncertainty of reliability-based product optimisation is not processed efficiently. Thirdly, no sufficient attention is being paid to capturing relationships among product components, despite such dependencies possibly exhibit a major impact on product functions. In order to address these issues, an environmentally friendly multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model for reliability-based product optimisation is proposed by combining a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)-based analytical network process (ANP) (DANP), interval uncertainty and the Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). The validity of this method is demonstrated by a numerical example.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental requirement of the supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete-event systems is a finite automaton model of the plant. The requirement does not hold for black-box systems whose source code and logical model are not accessible. To apply SCT to black-box systems, we integrate automaton learning technology with SCT and apply the new method to improve the requirements conformance of software reuse. If the reused software component does not satisfy a requirement, the method adds a supervisor component to prevent the black-box system from reaching \u201cfaulty sections.\u201d The method employs learning-based testing (LBT) to verify whether the reused software meets all requirements in the new context. LBT generates a large number of test cases and iteratively constructs an automaton model of the system under test. If the system fails the test, the learned model is applied as the plant model for control synthesis using SCT. Then, the supervisor is implemented as an executable program to monitor and control the system to follow the requirement. Finally, the integrated system, including the supervisory program and the reused component, is tested by LBT to assure the satisfiability of the requirement. This paper makes two contributions. First, we innovatively integrate LBT and SCT for the control synthesis of black-box reactive systems. Second, software component reuse is still possible even if it does not satisfy user requirements at the outset.   Note to Practitioners \u2014In black-box software reuse, if a component does not satisfy user requirements in a new context, the developer has to abandon it and develop a new one, which is costly. The proposed method enables software reuse for black-box reactive systems by combining learning-based testing (LBT) and supervisory control theory (SCT). LBT can test whether the requirements hold in new settings and infer hypothesis models of the component at the same time. If the component does not pass the test, the learned hypothesis is used as a plant model to compute a supervisor using SCT. Then, a supervisory program is developed according to the control actions of the supervisor to govern the system to follow the behavior of the requirements. We illustrate the proposed method through an example of a simple cruise control module. The effectiveness of the new method is demonstrated with a larger software component brake-by-wire with floating point data types. The case studies show not only the methodology of the new approach but also a working tool chain to perform it.",

        "abstract": "The work proposes a synthesis method of supervisors for flexible manufacturing systems modeled by a class of generalized Petri nets. A concept of resource usage ratios (RU-ratios) is first presented to describe the occupation degree of a resource by an operation. Next, an intrinsically live structure characterized by a special numerical relationship between arc-weights and initial markings is investigated from a perspective of RU-ratios. Then, a new kind of supervisors is synthesized on the ground of the generic nature of the intrinsically live structure. Such a supervisor can achieve the purposes of both liveness-enforcement and resource usage ratio-enforcement of the system under consideration. Given a plant, it is easy to determine the topological structure of such a supervisor and the number of monitors is bounded by that of resources used in the plant. In addition, when the configuration of the plant model changes, the supervisor can be reusable through adjusting control parameters only without rearrangement of connections. This makes it easy enough and intuitive to be used by industrial practitioners. Instead of maximal behavioral permissiveness, it pursues a precise usage of shared resources that are limited and valuable. Several examples are used to illustrate the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "With growing environmental and sustainability-related concerns, recovery optimization of mechanical products has been gaining increased exposure. It facilitates environmental sustainability through the improvement in the life-cycle material efficiency and reduction in environmental impact with disassembly sequence planning, component reuse, and material recycling. Traditional product recovery separates end-of-life (EOL) products into components and selects EOL options of components. However, there are many practical cases in which the recovery of a set of subassemblies and components leads to better net revenue than that of a complete set of single components. This paper proposes to model and optimize hybrid disassembly and EOL operations of product recovery to maximize the recovery profit and minimize the environmental impact. Flexible process planning of hybrid disassembly determines a disassembly level by identifying the reusability of subassemblies and disassembly sequences mixed with subassemblies and components. Optimal EOL decisions for each subassembly and component are investigated such that the economic and environmental objectives can be achieved. Finally, a case study is described to illustrate the proposed method and the influence on decision variables of the tradeoff between the recovery profit and environmental impact is discussed.  Note to Practitioners \u2014This paper deals with the process planning and EOL decision-making problem of product recovery. Based on hybrid disassembly, this paper proposes a flexible process planning and EOL decision-making method for product recovery. Flexible process planning of hybrid disassembly determines a disassembly level by identifying the reusability of subassemblies and disassembly sequences mixed with subassemblies and components. Optimal EOL decisions for each subassembly and component are investigated such that the economic and environmental objectives can be achieved. The goal of this paper is to model and optimize hybrid disassembly and EOL operations of product recovery to maximize the recovery profit and minimize the environmental impact. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can leads to small environmental impact and low cost. Subassemblies and components with high reliability and expensive price are suggested to be destined for reuse. Minimizing transportation distances is more effective to reduce product recovery cost. Such results can help decision makers to perform better judgments when a disassembly process of an EOL product is executed.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of deadlocks in automated flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). Based on Petri nets, a deadlock prevention policy is proposed for a special class of Petri nets, S3PR. We apply the deadlock avoidance policy (DAP) of Conjunctive/Disjunctive Resources Upstream Neighborhood (C/D RUN) to the deadlock prevention policy (DPP), and allocate the underlying (sequential) resource reasonably to guarantee the absence of deadlock states and processes. First, siphons in a net model are distinguished by elementary and dependent ones. From the set of elementary siphons, a set of linear inequality constraints expressed by the state vector can be formalized. After being modified by the proposed policy, a set of generalized mutual exclusion constraints (GMEC) expressed by the marking vector can be found. Then monitors based on the GMEC are added to the plant model such that the elementary siphons in the S3PR net are all invariant-controlled and no emptiable siphon is generated due to the addition of the monitors. This novel deadlock prevention policy can usually lead to a more permissive supervisor by adding a smaller number of monitors and arcs than the existing methods for the design of liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisors. Finally a manufacturing example is utilized to illustrate the proposed method and comparison with the existing ones. \u00a9 2008 IEEE.",

        "title": "On systematic methods to remove redundant monitors from liveness-enforcing net supervisors",
        "abstract": "Petri nets based deadlock prevention for flexible manufacturing systems has received much attention over the past decade, primarily due to the seminal work of Ezpeleta et al. in 1995. A Petri net based deadlock prevention mechanism is usually implemented by adding monitors or control places to a plant Petri net model such that liveness can be enforced. The significance of this methodology lies in that both a plant model and its supervisor are in a same formalism-Petri nets. Due to the inherent complexity of Petri nets, in theory, the number of additional monitors that have to been added to achieve liveness-enforcement purpose for an uncontrolled plant model is exponential with respect to the size of the model. This paper first proposes a systematic method to minimize the number of additional monitors in a liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor such that the resultant net system has the same permissive behavior while liveness can still be preserved. Furthermore, for the liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisors of flexible manufacturing systems, which have some particular property, an algorithm is developed such that more permissive liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisors can be obtained after liveness-restrictive monitor removal. Compared with the existing techniques of eliminating redundant monitors in the literature, the complete state enumeration of a supervisor is avoided, which implies the high computational efficiency of the methods in this paper. Flexible manufacturing examples are used to demonstrate the proposed approaches.",

The existing computation methods in the literature depend on the complete siphon enumeration of a net. Since the number of minimal siphons grows in general exponentially with respect to the size of a net, it is difficult to compute all the SMS. This paper proposes a fast algorithm to find a set of elementary siphons for an L-S3PR based on partial SMS from a structural perspective. We show an approach to obtain a minimal siphon from a resource circuit. The concepts of the complementary matrix and independent arcs in a resource directed graph are proposed, which are important in our method. We describe the method of computing independent arcs in details. Then an algorithm to find a set of elementary siphons for an L-S3PR is developed. Compared with the existing methods, our method is much efficient",

A relevant property of the system behavior is to be non-blocking, i.e., from any reachable state, a desirable state can be always obtained under supervision. The analysis of the system leads us to characterize deadlock situations in terms of an unmarked siphon based on the Petri nets model. Our deadlock prevention policy is to make all unmarked siphons satisfying cs-property when all elementary siphons are properly supervised. Compared with the existing policies, the advantage of the policy is that a much smaller number of supervisor places are added and unnecessary iterative processes are avoided. Finally, the application of the approach is illustrated with a realistic G-system example.",

An iterative deadlock control policy is usually considered to be a natural solution with reasonable computational cost for a large-scale system where direct methods would be prohibitively expensive (and in some cases impossible) even with the best available computing power. This paper reviews the existing iterative deadlock prevention policies for discrete event systems that are modeled with Petri nets. A number of technical problems in the existing iterative deadlock control approaches are formulated and discussed. Their solutions are illustrated through case studies. We conclude that the suitability, effectiveness, and efficiency of an iterative deadlock control approach are sensitive to specific examples, and no general algorithm is found in the literature, which works well for all cases.",

This paper proposes an on-line approach to address the problem of current-state opacity in discrete event systems (DESs) modeled in a labeled Petri Net (PN) framework and by observing its evolution. An observation of the system is said to be current-state opaque if the intruder is unable to determine whether the current state of the system is within a set of secret states, otherwise it is said to be not current-state opaque. The proposed approach to verify the current-state opacity works on-line: the verification algorithm waits for the occurrence of an observable event and uses Integer Linear Programming problem solutions to verify if the behavior of the system is current-state opaque to the intruder under the given observation. Moreover, the proposed method is applied in two different settings: (i) a centralized approach where the intruder has full knowledge of the system model but can partially observe the system behavior; (ii) a decentralized approach where a set of intruders can observe different event sets and collaborate with a coordinator to disclose the same secret. Finally, experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",

Based on Petri nets, a deadlock prevention policy is proposed for a special class of Petri nets, S3PR. We distinguish siphons in a net model by elementary and dependent ones. For each elementary siphon, a monitor is added to the plant model such that it is invariant-controlled and the mathematical programming technique is employed to guarantee that no emptiable control-induced siphon is generated due to the addition of the monitor. This novel deadlock prevention policy can usually lead to a more permissive supervisor by adding a small number of monitors and arcs than the existing methods for the design of liveness enforcing Petri net supervisors.

The numerical relationships among weights, and between weights and initial markings are investigated based on simple circuits of resource places, which are the simplest structure of circular wait, rather than siphons.

However, the set of reachable states is required, which usually leads to the state explosion problem. This paper presents a symbolic approach to the computation of marking/transition separation instances for safe Petri nets by using BDD (Binary Decision Diagrams). In this paper, the structure and behavior of a Petri net are symbolically modeled by using Boolean algebra. Boolean algebra operations are implemented by BDD which are capable of representing large sets of reachable states with small shared data structures and enable the efficient manipulation of those sets. Therefore, the cost of computation and memory usage can be efficiently reduced. Finally, using the model of the well-known dining philosophers problem, we verify the efficiency of calculating the set of legal states, dangerous states, bad states and the marking/transition separation instances through different-sized problems.",

For a class of Petri nets that can model flexible manufacturing systems, sufficient conditions are proposed to decide whether there exists a siphon that cannot be optimally controlled.

        "abstract": "In the past two decades, a number of Petri-net-based approaches were proposed for deadlock prevention in flexible manufacturing\n systems (FMS). An FMS is modeled as a Petri net, and then the controller or the liveness enforcing supervisor (LES) is computed as a Petri net. A live Petri net (LPN) guarantees deadlock-free operations of the modeled FMS. An LES consists of a number of control places (CPs) and their related arcs. To-date most of the attention has been paid to make the underlying Petri net models live without\n questioning whether or not all of the computed CPs are necessary. It is often the case that the number of CPs determined by these approaches is not minimal. Reducing it in order to reduce the complexity of the controlled system is\n an important issue that was not tackled before. To address this problem, this paper proposes a redundancy test for an LES of an FMS. The proposed approach takes an LPN model, controlled by n\n CPs, as input and in the existence of any redundant CPs it produces redundant and necessary CPs. The proposed approach is applicable to any LPN consisting of a Petri net model (PNM), controlled by means of a set of CPs.",

        "abstract": "To effectively operate a refinery and make it competitive, efficient short-term scheduling techniques that utilize commercial software tools for practical applications need to be developed. However, cumbersome details make it difficult to solve the short-term scheduling problem (STSP) of crudeoil operations, and mathematical programming models fail to meet the industrial needs. This article proposes an innovative control-theoretic and formal model-based method to tackle this long-standing issue. This method first models the STSP as a hybrid Petri net (PN) and then derives critically important schedulability conditions. The conditions are used to decompose a complex problem into several tractable subproblems. In each subproblem, there are either continuous variables or discrete variables. For subproblems with continuous variables, this work proposes a linear programming-based method to solve them; while, for subproblems with discrete variables, this work adopts efficient heuristics. Consequently, the STSP is efficiently resolved,and the application of the proposed method is well illustrated via industrial case studies.",

For each elementary siphon, a monitor is added to ensure that it is sufficiently marked without generating emptiable control-induced siphons. The controllability of a dependent siphon is guaranteed by changing the control depth variables of its related elementary siphons, which leads to a liveness-enforcing supervisor for a plant model. Furthermore, by checking the redundancy of the additional monitors, some control-redundant monitors can be removed, which leads to a more permissive and structurally simple net supervisor.",

We consider not only the case where faults occur either on transitions or places, but also a more general case where faults occur on both transitions and places at the same time. Some faults cannot be diagnosed directly due to the unobservability of some transitions and places in a partially observed Petri net. We propose an approach to diagnose the faults that cannot be diagnosed directly using by an algebraic decoding technique. More specifically, we employ Nearest Neighbour Decoding (NND) to determine event occurrences in a Petri net based on the observations from sensors in places and transitions, and then the expected marking can be calculated. Fault diagnosis is based on the difference between the expected marking and the observed marking.",

As an important problem solution paradigm in computer science, the divide-and-conquer strategy is used in this paper to investigate the deadlock prevention for flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) that are modeled with Petri nets. Based on the concept of resource circuits, a plant net model is divided into an idle subnet, an autonomous subnet, and a number of small but independent subnets, called toparchies, from the viewpoint of deadlock control. A liveness-enforcing supervisor, called toparch, is designed for each toparchy. If a particular separation condition holds in a plant net model, the computational complexity of toparches is significantly reduced. This research shows that the resultant net, called monarch, by composing the toparches derived for the toparchies can serve as a liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor for the whole plant model. FMS examples are given to illustrate the proposed method.",

At first stage, a monitor (control place) is added for each elementary siphon such that it is invariantcontrolled.

The second stage sees that monitors are added to make always marked control-induced siphons in the resultant RCN-merged net without generating new control-induced siphons.

        "abstract": "Analysis and control of deadlocks play an important role in the design and operation of automated flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). In FMS, deadlocks are highly undesirable situations, which always cause unnecessary cost. The design problem of an optimal supervisor is in general NP-hard. A computationally efficient method often ends up with a suboptimal one. This paper develops a deadlock prevention policy based on resources reallocation and supervisor reconfiguration. First, given a plant model, we reallocate the marking of each resource place to be one, obtaining a net model whose reachable states are much less than that of the original one. In this case, we find a controlled system for it by using the theory of regions. Next, the markings of the resource places in the controlled system are restored to their original ones. Without changing the structure of the obtained controlled system, we compute the markings of the monitors gradually, which can be realized by two algorithms proposed in this paper. Finally, we decide a marking for each monitor such that it makes the controlled system live with nearly optimal permissive behavior. Two FMS examples are used to illustrate the application of the proposed method and show its superior efficiency. \u00a9 2013 Miao Liu et al.",

Both can find a maximally permissive liveness-enforcing supervisor with a small number of control places. A vector covering approach is used to obtain a minimal covering set of legal markings and a minimal covered set of first-met bad markings (FBMs), which are much smaller than the sets of legal markings and FBMs, respectively. At each iteration, by solving an integer linear programming problem (ILPP), a place invariant (PI) associated with a control place is designed to forbid as many FBMs as possible, and no markings in the minimal covering set of legal markings are forbidden. The objective function of the ILPP maximizes the number of FBMs that are forbidden by the PI. Then, the forbidden FBMs by the PI are removed from the minimal covered set of FBMs. This process is carried out until all FBMs are forbidden. Two ILPP design techniques are developed for the control policies. Though the proposed methods cannot in general guarantee the minimality of the supervisory structure, they reduce the overall computational time greatly, which is shown by numerical studies. Finally, a number of FMS examples from the literature are presented to illustrate the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of deadlocks in automated flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). Based on Petri nets, a deadlock prevention policy is proposed for a special class of Petri nets, S3PR. We distinguish siphons in a net model by elementary and dependent ones. For each elementary siphon, a monitor is added to the plant model such that it is invariant controlled and the mathematical programming technique is employed to guarantee that no emptiable control-induced siphon is generated due to the addition of the monitor. This novel deadlock prevention policy can usually lead to a more permissive supervisor by adding a small number of monitors and arcs than the existing methods for the design of liveness enforcing Petri net supervisors. A flexible manufacturing example is utilized to illustrate the methods proposed in this paper.",

        "abstract": "As a structural object, siphons are well recognized in the analysis and control of deadlocks in resource allocation systems modeled with Petri nets. Many deadlock prevention policies characterize the deadlock behavior of the systems in terms of siphons and utilize this characterization to avoid deadlocks. This paper develops a novel methodology to find interesting siphons for deadlock control purposes in a class of Petri nets, i.e., a system of simple sequential processes with resources . Resource circuits in an are first detected, from which, in general, a small portion of emptiable minimal siphons can be derived. The remaining emptiable ones can be found by their composition. A polynomial-time algorithm for finding the set of elementary siphons is proposed, which avoids complete siphon enumeration. It is shown that a dependent siphon can always be controlled by properly supervising its elementary siphons. A computationally efficient deadlock control policy is accordingly developed. Experimental study shows the efficiency of the proposed siphon computation approach.",

        "abstract": "With the development of communication and control technology, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have received increasing attention from both industry and academia. However, plenty of studies providing different formulations for ITS depend on Master Control Center and require a high level of hardware configuration. The systematized technologies for distributed architectures are still not explored in detail. In this paper, we proposed a novel distributed cyber\u2013physical system for connected and automated vehicles, and related methodologies are illustrated. Every vehicle in this system is modeled as a double-integrator and supposed to travel along a desired trajectory for maintaining a rigid formation geometry. The desired trajectory is generated by reference leading vehicles using information from multiple sources, while ordinary following vehicles use velocity and position information from their nearest neighbors and sensor information from on-board sensors to correct their own performance. Information graphs are used to illustrate the interaction topology between connected and automated vehicles. Edge computing technology is used to analyze and process information, such that the risk of privacy leaks can be greatly reduced. The performance scaling laws for the network with a one-dimensional information graph are generalized to networks with  D  -dimensional information graphs, and the results of the experiments show that the performance of the connected and automated vehicles matches very well with analytic predictions. Some design guidelines and open questions are provided for the future study.",

        "abstract": "Supervisory control is usually considered as an external control mechanism to a system by controlling the occurrences of its controllable events. There exist Petri net models whose legal reachability spaces are nonconvex. In this case, they cannot be optimally controlled by the conjunctions of linear constraints. For Petri net models of flexible manufacturing systems, this work proposes a method to classify the legal markings into several subsets. Each subset is associated with a linear constraint that can forbid all first-met bad markings. Then, the disjunctions of the obtained constraints can make all legal markings reachable and forbid all first-met bad markings, i.e., the controlled net is live and maximally permissive. An integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize the number of the constraints. A supervisory structure is also proposed to implement the disjunctions of the constraints. Finally, examples are provided to illustrate the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic reconfiguration techniques can greatly improve the flexibility and reliability of manufacturing systems. However, different from static reconfigurable systems, system behavior during dynamic reconfiguration processes is quite complex due to possible concurrence of system structure changes and events inside unaltered components. This increases the difficulty in designing and developing dynamic reconfigurable systems. The current paper deals with the analysis and control of dynamic reconfiguration process of manufacturing systems from the perspective of discrete event systems. To this end, the authors improve the reconfigurable timed net condition/event systems formalism by assigning reconfiguration functions with extra permeating time, action ranges, and concurrent decision functions. As a consequence, nondeterministic behavior of a dynamic reconfigurable system during dynamic reconfigurations can be specified, while the system correctness, coherence, and safety during reconfigurations can be guaranteed. A reconfigurable manufacturing plant is used as a running example to illustrate the contribution of this paper.",

The decentralized architecture consists of a set of local sites communicating with a coordinator that decides whether the system behavior is normal or subject to some possible faults. To this aim, some results allow defining the rules applied by the coordinator and the local sites to provide the global diagnosis results. Moreover, two protocols for the detection and diagnosis of faults are proposed: they differ for the information exchanged between local sites and coordinator and the diagnostic capability. In addition, a sufficient and necessary condition under which the second presented protocol can successfully diagnose a fault in the decentralized architecture is proved.

        "abstract": "Deadlocks are an undesirable situation in automated flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). Their occurrences often deteriorate the utilization of resources and may lead to catastrophic results. Finding an optimal supervisor is NP-hard. A computationally efficient method often ends up with a suboptimal one. This paper develops a deadlock prevention method that makes a good tradeoff between optimality and computational tractability for a class of Petri nets, which can model many FMS. The theory of regions guides our efforts toward the development of near-optimal solutions for deadlock prevention. Given a plant net, a minimal initial marking is first decided by structural analysis, and an optimal live controlled system is computed. Then, a set of inequality constraints is derived with respect to the markings of monitors and the places in the model such that no siphon can be insufficiently marked. A method is proposed to identify the redundancy condition for constraints. For a new initial marking of the plant net, a deadlock-free controlled system can be obtained by regulating the markings of the monitors such that the inequality constraints are satisfied, without changing the structure of the controlled system. The near-optimal performance of a controlled net system via the proposed method is shown through several examples.",

        "abstract": "A traditional power transmission system (TPTS) is composed of many electrical substations (ESs) and transmission lines. When the latter meet faults, the output of the ESs may be interrupted. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to construct controlled systems with battery energy storage systems to avoid the output interruption during the fault detection and restoration for some important ESs. In a TPTS, an important ES can be controlled by a supervisor that can be thought of as a control agent. Moreover, the ES can be preconnected with other ESs. If a fault occurs in the input lines of the ES, the fault can be detected by its supervisor and restored by its preconnected ESs. Furthermore, the ES can contain a battery energy storage system to store electric power for its temporary output during the fault detection and restoration. Therefore, the output interruption of the ES can be successfully avoided. This work formally models the structures of TPTSs and their control systems by using Petri nets and then verifies the correctness of fault detection and restoration. Finally, a case study is presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a deadlock prevention approach to find a maximally permissive liveness-enforcing pure Petri net supervisor, expressed by a set of monitors, for a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), if such a supervisor exists. Otherwise, it derives the most permissive one in the sense that there are no other Petri net supervisors that are more permissive than it. The proposed approach computes the reachability graph of a plant model only once. By using a vector covering approach, the sets of legal markings and first-met bad markings (FBMs) are reduced to two smaller ones, namely the minimal covering set of legal markings and the minimal covered set of FBMs. At each iteration, an FBM is selected. By solving an integer linear programming problem (ILPP), a place invariant (PI) is designed to prevent the FBM from being reached while no marking in the minimal covering set of legal markings is forbidden. If the ILPP has no solution, implying that there is no maximally permissive Petri net supervisor for the plant net model, another ILPP is designed to remove the least number of legal markings whose reachability conditions contradict others. Then, a PI is redesigned to ensure that the remaining legal markings are reachable. This process is carried out until no FBM can be reached. Finally, a most permissive liveness-enforcing supervisor is obtained. FMS examples are presented to illustrate the proposed approaches. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "In automated manufacturing systems (AMSs), Petri nets are widely adopted to solve supervisory control problems. Among them, how to enforce liveness and fairness for AMS constitutes an important problem. Enforcing liveness avoids the occurrence of deadlock situations to inhibit the emergence of partial or complete blockness for processing jobs in AMS. Fairness requires the determination of a reasonable regulation scheme for orderly resolution such that a desired ratio can be assigned among different processes. This paper proposes an efficient method to design supervisors that enforce both, which is based on the invariance property of Petri nets. A novel approach is proposed to iteratively identify empty siphons as solutions to a set of linear inequalities. Supervisors are then designed to control these siphons. The applicability of the proposed methodology is illustrated through examples. Its comparison with existing works is presented to demonstrate its advantages.",

        "abstract": "A variety of important Petri net-based methods to prevent deadlocks arising in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) are to add some control places and related arcs to strict minimal siphons (SMS) such that no siphon can be emptied. Since the number of minimal siphons grows in general exponentially with respect to a Petri net size, their disadvantages lie in that they often add too many additional places to the net, thereby making the resulting net model much more complex than the original one. This paper explores ways to minimize the new additions of places while achieving the same control purpose. It proposes for the first time the concept of elementary siphons that are a special class of siphons. The set of elementary siphons in a Petri net is generally a proper subset of the set of all SMS. Its smaller cardinality becomes evident in large Petri net models. This paper proves that by adding a control place for each elementary siphon to make sure that it is marked, deadlock can be successfully prevented. Compared with the existing methods, the new method requires a much smaller number of control places and, therefore, is suitable for large-scale Petri nets. An FMS example is used to illustrate the proposed concepts and policy, and show the significant advantage over the previous methods.",

        "abstract": "Anomaly detection has received much attention due to its various applications. Generally, the first step to discover anomalies is a data representation method which reduces dimensionality as well as preserves key information. Anomaly detection based on real-value representation methods is meaningful for its convenience in numeric operation. A typical real-value representation method is the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) that is simple and intuitive by capturing mean values of segments in a sequence. However, if segments are same or similar in their average values but different in their oscillation amplitudes, the PAA method is ineffective to describe a sequence composed of such segments. To address this issue, we propose a representation method called the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation in the Amplitude Domain (AD-PAA). For discovering anomalies, a sequence is partitioned into subsequences by a sliding window firstly. Then in the AD-PAA method, a subsequence is divided into equal size subsections according to the amplitude domain. With mean values of subsections computed, the amplitude oscillation of a subsequence is embodied effectively. When the AD-PAA method is applied to approximate subsequences, the AD-PAA representation of a sequence is constructed. Anomalies are determined by anomaly scores that are based on similarities among representation results. Experimental results on various data confirm that the proposed method is more accurate than the PAA based method and other comparison methods. The ability to differentiate anomalies of the proposed algorithm is also superior.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of fault identification in a system. The system is originally modeled by a Petri net, called a nominal (fault-free) net, and faults are considered as unobservable transitions not contained in the nominal net. It is assumed that partial places of the nominal net are observable and the output of the system is defined as an observed evolution, i.e., a sequence involving transitions and markings of the observable places. When faults occur, the observed evolution cannot be generated by the nominal net. We provide an approach that identifies unobservable transitions by constructing and solving an Integer Linear Programming problem according to the observed evolution and the nominal net. A faulty net is obtained by adding the identified unobservable transitions to the nominal one such that it coincides with the observed evolution. In addition, two methods to ensure acyclicity of the identified subnet, i.e., a net that includes unobservable transitions only, are reported.",

However, it is quite time-consuming or even impossible to get the complete siphon enumeration of a Petri net. This paper focuses on the deadlock prevention problems in flexible manufacturing systems that are modeled with S4PR, a general class of Petri nets. The analysis of S4PR leads us to characterize deadlock situations in terms of insufficiently marked siphons. The method proposed in this paper is an iterative approach. At each iteration, a non-max-marked siphon is computed by solving a mixed integer linear programming problem. Then the siphon is max-marked through a P-invariant by adding a monitor place. This process is carried out until no non-max-marked siphon can be found in the net. As a result all the siphons in the net are max-controlled. Then the net becomes live. Without computing all the siphons, a monitor-based liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor can be found with more permissive behavior. A number of flexible manufacturing examples are used to demonstrate the proposed methods.",

The concept of elementary siphons is proposed, it is a class of SMS (strict minimal siphons) with a smaller cardinality, particularly in the Petri net models of large-scale systems. By adding a control place for each elementary siphon to make it never be emptied, deadlocks can be prevented for a special class of Petri nets, namely S3 PR. That means not all SMS need to be considered when ensuring no siphon loses its tokens. For S3 PR, an approach is proposed for finding elementary siphons and SMS. Compared with the existing methods that control all SMS in a Petri net, the deadlock prevention policy has at least three advantages: 1) only a smaller number of SMS need to be controlled, hence the deadlock-freeness or live Petri net model obtained has less additional places and arcs; 2) not need to compute the set of siphons beforehand; and 3) this policy is more suitable for large-scale Petri nets. These methods are illustrated with an example.",

        "abstract": "In many flexible assembly systems, base components are transported with pallets; parts to be mounted onto the base ones are transported by trays with no pallets. When an assembly operation is performed by using some parts in a tray but not all, the tray with the remaining parts still occupies a buffer space. In this way, an assembly/disassembly material flow is formed. In such a material flow, deadlock can occur both in the base component and part flow. Furthermore, the assembly operations can also result in a deadlock. Thus, it is a great challenge to tackle deadlocks in such processes. This paper models them using resource-oriented Petri nets. Based on the models, a deadlock control policy is proposed and proved to be computationally efficient and less conservative than the existing policies in the literature.

The research shows that different sets of elementary siphons have different effects in terms of reachable states using a same control synthesis method.

In this paper, based on the optimization model offered by Ye et al. J Vis Commun Image Represent 44:72\u201381 (2017), three improvements are further proposed. First, a feature adjustment strategy based on a group of neighbors is offered to alleviate a sharp reduction of features. Then, when the features are no longer well representing the scene of interest, a score model based on a weighted histogram for result evaluations is presented to realize an adaptive interval. Besides, a forward-backward algorithm is provided to improve the accuracy by replacing the detection method with the tracking method.

First, it provides a minimal supervisory control structure in the sense of the number of monitors that are used to prevent the occurrences of the forbidden states in a plant model. A monitor is designed by associating a P-semiflow with other places in the plant. Second, the supervisor is maximally permissive, i.e., no admissible state is excluded. If a maximally permissive supervisor does not exist, a most permissive supervisor can be similarly designed. A partial reachability graph of a plant is generated by considering the given forbidden states, from which first-met bad markings are then identified. Integer linear programming problems are employed to offer monitor solutions to ensure that the first-met bad markings are not reachable. Generalized mutual exclusion constraints are considered in this work. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the reconfigurable real-time systems that should be adapted to their environment under real-time constraints. The reconfiguration allows moving from one implementation to another by adding/removing/modifying parameters of real-time software tasks which should meet related deadlines. Implementing those systems as threads generates a complex system code due to the large number of threads, which may lead to a reconfiguration time overhead as well as the energy consumption and the memory allocation increase. Thus this paper proposes a multiobjective optimization approach for reconfigurable systems called MO\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nR\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nS for the development of a reconfigurable real-time system. Given a specification, the proposed approach aims to produce an optimal design while ensuring the system feasibility. We focus on three optimization criteria: 1) response time; 2) memory allocation; and 3) energy consumption. To address the portability issue, the optimal design is then transformed to an abstract code that may in turn be transformed to a concrete code which is specific to a procedural programming (i.e., POSIX) or an object-oriented language (i.e., RT-Java). The MO\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nR\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nS approach allows reducing the number of threads by minimizing the redundancy between the implementation sets. By an experimental study, such optimization permits to decrease the memory allocation by 28.89%, the energy consumption by 40.2%, and the response time by 61.32%.",

It is proved that the number of elementary siphons in a Petri net is bounded by the smaller of place count and transition count. We investigate the conditions under which there is no weakly dependent siphon in a Petri net. A polynomial algorithm is developed to decide the set of elementary siphons for the deadlock control purpose. Some interesting and open problems on elementary siphons are finally discussed.",

The proposed method combines elementary siphons with a characteristic structure-based method to prevent deadlocks and enforce liveness to the net class under consideration. The characteristic structure-based method is further advanced in this work. It unveils and takes a full advantage of an intrinsically live structure of generalized Petri nets, which hides behind the arc weights, to achieve the liveness enforcement without any external control agent such as monitors. This hybrid method can identify and remove redundant monitors from a liveness-enforcing supervisor designed according to existing policies, improve the permissiveness, reduce the structural complexity of a controlled system, and consequently save the control implementation cost. Several examples are used to illustrate this method.",

        "title": "Evaluation of deadlock control designs in automated manufacturing systems",
        "abstract": "Petri nets are an effective way to model, analyze, and control deadlocks in automated manufacturing systems (AMS). There are three important criteria in designing and evaluating a liveness-enforcing supervisor for a system to be controlled: behavioral permissiveness, structural complexity, and computational complexity. A maximally permissive supervisor can lead to high utilization of system resources. A supervisor with a simple structure can decrease the hardware and software costs. As for the computational complexity, means that a deadlock control policy can be applied to large systems. The objective of this paper is to design liveness-enforcing supervisors for different flexible manufacturing systems, simulate the controlled systems, and estimate the utilization of resources and throughput of the system. The siphon control methods (Strict Minimal Siphons and Elementary Siphons) are used to solve the deadlock control problems for a number of AMSs with different sizes. Moreover, the paper aims to evaluate the performance of selected methods such as utilization of resources, throughput, and the number of monitors, arcs, and states. Finally, the computational results indicate that the elementary siphons based policy provides better structural complexity and computational complexity than the strict minimal siphons based policy. However, strict minimal siphons based policy leads to better behavioral permissiveness than elementary siphons methods.",

Characterization in terms of special\n structural elements in a Petri net called siphons has been a major approach for the investigation of deadlock-freeness in\n context of FMS. Utilizing the optimal elementary siphons and the modified mixed integer programming (MIP) algorithm proposed\n in this paper, one can detect and solve deadlock problems arising in FMS in an iterative mode with tractable computational\n complexity. Moreover, the MIP approach can be exploited to implement the flexibility enhancement in the resultant net system\n so that the obtained system is less restricted. In contrast to the conventional typical policies, this approach evolves without\n explicitly enumerating all the strict minimal siphons. Its legitimacy and feasibility are proved and validated through an\n experimental study.",

        "abstract": "This work applies a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle deadlock prevention issues in a class of generalized Petri nets, WS3PR, an extended S3PR. And, the strategy is improved by utilizing a previous result of WS3PR, i.e., a WS3PR with a characteristic structure is inherently live at some proper initial markings. Given a marked WS3PR, after being divided into an idle subnet, an autonomous one, and some so-called toparchies, every toparchy is checked according to the result to decide whether it is inherently live at the current initial marking. This strategy for deadlock prevention in WS3PR can effectively reduce computational complexity, structural complexity, and improve system permissiveness. Some explanatory examples are used to illustrate this strategy.",

By considering regional constraints, this work proposes a new random fuzzy cost-profit equilibrium model by using uncertainty data and management methods. It presents a hybrid algorithm integrating stochastic fuzzy simulation and particle swarm optimization to solve the location problem of an automobile service enterprise.

        "abstract": "In this paper a divide-and-conquer-method for the synthesis of liveness enforcing supervisors (LES) for flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) is proposed. Given the Petri net model (PNM) of an FMS prone to deadlocks, it aims to synthesize a live controlled Petri net system. For complex systems, the use of reachability graph (RG) based deadlock prevention methods is a challenging problem, as the RG of a PNM easily becomes unmanageable. To obtain the LESs from a large PNM is usually intractable. In this paper, to ease this problem the PNM of a system is divided into small connected subnets. Each connected subnet prone to deadlocks is then used to compute the LES for the original PNM. Starting from the simplest subnet prone to deadlocks to make the subnet live, monitors (control places) are computed. The RG of each subnet is considered and split into a dead-zone (DZ) and a live-zone. All states in the DZ are prevented from being reached by means of a well-established invariant-based control method. Next, the computation of monitors is followed for bigger subnets. Previously computed monitors are included within the bigger subnets based on a criterion. This process keeps the DZ of the bigger subnets smaller compared with the original uncontrolled subnets. When all subnets are live we obtain a set of monitors that are included within the PNM to obtain a partially controlled PNM (pCPNM). A new set of monitors is also computed for the pCPNM. Finally, a live controlled Petri net system is obtained. The proposed method is generally applicable, easy to use, effective and straightforward although its off-line computation is of exponential complexity in theory. Its use for FMS control guarantees deadlock-free operation and high performance in terms of resource utilization and system throughput. Two FMS deadlock problems from the literature are used to illustrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In the above paper, it proposes a deadlock prevention policy for a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), which needs the complete state enumeration of the FMS that is modeled with Petri nets. The reachability graph of a Petri-net model is divided into two parts: the live zone (LZ) and the deadlock zone (DZ). The states in the LZ of the reachability graph of a Petri net constitute the legal behavior of the net from the viewpoint of deadlock prevention. The concept of first-met bad markings is proposed. A first-met bad marking is a node in DZ, whose father nodes are in LZ. The deadlock prevention policy is used in an iterative way. At each iteration, a first-met bad marking is identified from the reachability graph of a Petri net to be controlled. The reachability of a first-met bad marking is prohibited by adding a monitor, establishing a marking invariance relationship between the additional monitor and the activity places that are marked under the first-met bad marking. To achieve this, without a formal proof, [Lemma 1] is developed as shown in this article.",

        "abstract": "This paper illustrates that Petrinets with self-loops are more powerful than pure nets in modeling and control of flexible manufacturing systems. A self-loop in a Petri net cannot be mathematically represented by its incidence matrix. This paper presents a mathematical method to design a maximally permissive Petri net supervisor that is expressed by a set of control places with self-loops. A control place with a self-loop can be represented by a constraint and a self-loop associated with a transition whose firing may lead to an illegal marking. The constraint is designed to ensure that all legal markings are reachable and the self-loop is used to prevent the system from reaching illegal markings by disabling the transition at a specific marking. A markingreduction approach is developed in order to cut down the considered markings, which can greatly decrease the computational overhead of the proposed method. An integer linear programming model is developed to compress the number of control places, aiming to reduce the structural complexity of the resulting supervisors. Finally, illustrative examples are used to validate the proposed method and to demonstrate that it can obtain an optimal supervisor for some cases that cannot be optimally controlled by pure net supervisors. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on establishing a Petri net (PN)-based deadlock prevention policy for large-scale systems whose state spaces are prone to the explosion problem phenomenon. When using the reachability analysis technique, the main burden is that the number of states grows exponentially with respect to the PN structure and, thereby, synthesizing a lively controlled Petri net model (PNM) becomes an extremely complex procedure. The proposed method reduces the initial marking of the PNM to reduce the size of the reachability graph. Such a reachability graph is reduced exponentially and the activity places are derived iteratively using a well-established invariant-based control method. When the PNM becomes live, the control places are integrated to the original PNM and, therefore, the advantage of this method lies in that the control of the original PN model starts at an earlier stage, i.e., before enumerating the full reachability graph and which we call it  one-step control-ahead  of a PNM. Compared with the existing methods, the new method requires the control of a very small-sized reachability graph and, therefore, it is convenient for large-scale and bounded PNs. Two examples are used to illustrate the proposed approach. Experimental results show that we can obtain optimal supervisors for the net models.",

        "abstract": "The separation of signal-and-noise subspaces is a crucial step in many array signal processing applications, since the performance of most high-resolution methods mainly depends on the accuracy of separated signal-and-noise subspaces. If the resulting signal subspace is inaccurately estimated, high-resolution subspace-based algorithms would most likely fail. In this paper, we propose a high-accuracy method to complete the separation of signal-and-noise subspaces. In the developed scheme, eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data received by the uniform linear array are first employed to construct an ideal sample space using the Schur product of matrices. Then, the Gaussian kernel is introduced to map the sample space into a new high-dimensional feature space, where the resulting structure becomes linearly separable. In the sequel, we propose two fuzzy set-based methods to divide the feature space into two subspaces, which correspond to the signal-and-noise subspaces. In this way, the signal subspace becomes separated. Experimental results show that, compared with the results produced by five other commonly used algorithms, the proposed method yields much higher accuracy, especially for low signal-to-noise ratio thresholds and small snapshots.",

However, there are many cases of missing anomaly and increased false alarm in most of the existing works. Inspired by the concept of interval-sets, this paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm called a fuzzy interval-set and tries to detect the potential value of the time series from a new perspective. In the proposed algorithm, a time series will be divided into several subsequences. Each subsequence is regarded as an interval-set depending on its value space and boundary of the subsequence. The similarity measurements between interval sets adopt interval operations and point probability distributions of the interval bounds. In addition, an anomaly score is defined based on similarity results. The experimental results on synthetic and real data sets indicate that the proposed algorithm has better discriminative performance than the piecewise aggregate approximation method and reduces the false alarm rate significantly.",

The analysis of generalised Petri nets leads us to characterise deadlock situations in terms of insufficiently marked siphons. The theory of elementary siphons guides our efforts towards the development of structurally simple liveness-enforcing supervisors. Therefore, insufficiently marked siphons can be classified into elementary ones and dependent ones. The controllability of a dependent siphon can be ensured by properly supervising its elementary ones. In order to find a compact and proper set of elementary siphons for S4PR, the concept of augmented siphons is proposed. Then, the concept of max\u2032-controlled siphons is employed, which can relax the siphon controllability condition. By explicitly controlling elementary siphons via adding monitors, a liveness-enforcing controlled system can be found. In addition, the liveness-enforcing supervisor with more permissive behaviour is obtained through the rearrangement of the output arcs of the monitors. Finally, an FMS case study is utilised to demonstrate the proposed method.",

This work studies the scheduling problem from a control-theoretic perspective. It proposes to use a hybrid Petri net method to model the system.

We design two group consensus protocols under different communication conditions. A sufficient condition is reported to guarantee that an HMAS can achieve group consensus asymptotically. Meanwhile, the final group consensus values of different groups are given. Furthermore, due to the bandwidth constraint existing in communication, the quantized group consensus is investigated. We also obtain a sufficient quantized group consensus condition. It is found that an HMAS can reach group consensus asymptotically under our protocol and the consensus errors almost converge to zero when the quantized errors tend to zero.

The\n insufficiently marked siphons are deployed to characterize the deadlock situations in an incidence matrix based way, which\n makes possible the study of the modeled systems from both structural and algebraic perspectives. The approach generates at\n each step a generalized mutual exclusion constraint which contains only markings for which liveness can be enforced. To avoid\n the explicit enumeration of all the set of strict minimal siphons, a set of mathematical programming formulations are established\n to implement the derivation of insufficiently marked siphons from the PT-transformation of the plant system.

        "abstract": "In the context of automated manufacturing, this work proposes a new special class of timed Petri nets, namely, Timed ratio-enforced Augmented Marked Graph (TAMG) and its low-cost and high-performance supervisor synthesis methodology. A supervisor is composed of a set of control places (monitors), each of which is easy to be algebraically specified by a generalized mutual exclusion constraint (GMEC) to prevent certain siphons from being undermarked. In order to make a good tradeoff between the supervisor implementation cost and system performance, a mixed integer programming (MIP) approach is formulated to synthesize the monitors. An example is used to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method remarkably outperforms any existing ones.",

A relevant property of the system behavior is that it is deadlock-free. Recent work has shown that deadlock situations\n in a plant system can be easily characterized by the structural analysis of the system, particularly, in terms of unmarked\n or insufficiently marked siphons in its Petri net model. The strict minimal siphons in a plant ES3PR net model are divided into elementary and dependent ones. The proposed deadlock prevention policy is to make all siphons\n satisfy maximal cs-property when the elementary siphons in the plant Petri net model are properly supervised via explicitly\n adding monitors for them with appropriate initial markings. Compared with the existing approaches in the literature, the advantage\n of the policy is that a much smaller number of supervisory places (monitors) are added and unnecessary iterative processes\n are avoided. Finally, its application is illustrated by a flexible manufacturing example.",

Resolving deadlocks is of paramount significance because their emergence reduces the system throughput to zero. Supervisory control technique is the most widely adopted method to resolve them. A control policy can be converted into satisfying a set of inequalities, each of which corresponds to a siphon in a Petri net structure. The number of siphons can be exponential in the worst case, so does the number of inequalities. Taking into account the independent and dependent inequalities, this paper proposes a method to remove all the dependent inequalities while preserving only the independent ones. This method can significantly reduce the size of a supervisory controller. Examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method.",

        "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the development of an approach to the diagnosability of a system described in the framework of partially observed Petri nets (POPNs) such that the developed fault diagnosis technique can be widely applicable to systems with mutable initial states and partial observations. Existing studies show that the diagnosability of a discrete event system (DES) can be improved by suitable sensor selections or redundancies. This paper proposes a redundancy-building method for a POPN with a certain sensor selection such that no matter how the POPN is initially marked, it achieves maximally structural diagnosability, i.e., the diagnosability of a system cannot be further improved based on the given sensor selection and knowledge of the plant model, which is critical and fundamental in fault recovery capabilities for operating large and complex DESs. To make the proposed method practically applicable, we do not require prior knowledge of faults or special structure of a system, instead we model faults as abnormal events occurring on transitions or places in the plant but not special transitions. Necessary and sufficient conditions for maximally structural diagnosability of a system are established. Redundancies (externally observable places) that guarantee behavior permissiveness and maximally structural diagnosability are built by solving integer linear programming problems.",

        "abstract": "We develop a novel deadlock control policy for modeling concurrent execution of manufacturing assembly processes in FMS through a class of nets, called G-system with limited shared resources, which is a large class of discrete event systems generalizing well-known models presented in the literature. A relevant property of the system behavior is to be non-blocking, i.e., from any reachable state, a desirable state can be always obtained under supervision. Resent work has shown that deadlock situations in terms of an unmarked siphon based on the Petri net models are characterized by the analysis of the system. Our deadlock prevention policy is to make all unmarked siphons satisfy cs-property when all elementary siphons are properly supervised. Compared with the existing policies, the advantage of the policy is that a much smaller number of supervisory places are added and unnecessary iterative processes are avoided. Finally, the application of the approach is illustrated with a realistic G-system example. \u00a9 2005 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Deadlocks are a rather undesirable situation in a highly automated flexible manufacturing system. Their occurrences often deteriorate the utilization of resources and may lead to catastrophic results in safety-critical systems. Graph theory, automata, and Petri nets are three important mathematical tools to handle deadlock problems in resource allocation systems. Particularly, Petri nets are considered as a popular formalism because of their inherent characteristics. They received much attention over the past decades to deal with deadlock problems, leading to a variety of deadlock-control policies. This study surveys the state-of-the-art deadlock-control strategies for automated manufacturing systems by reviewing the principles and techniques that are involved in preventing, avoiding, and detecting deadlocks. The focus is deadlock prevention due to its large and continuing stream of efforts. A control strategy is evaluated in terms of computational complexity, behavioral permissiveness, and structural complexity of its deadlock-free supervisor. This study provides readers with a conglomeration of the updated results in this area and facilitates engineers in finding a suitable approach for their industrial scenarios. Future research directions are finally discussed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Petri nets are an effective tool for modeling and analyzing deadlock problems of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). Based on Petri nets, this paper proposes a decomposition method for deadlock control of a class of Petri net modeling FMSs. It first decomposes a Petri net into two (or more) subnets via shared transitions and designs a liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor for each subnet. Then the root of causing deadlocks is analyzed when merging the controlled subnets. Finally, control places are adjoined to the merged net to obtain a liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor. The proposed method only needs to calculate the reachability graphs of the subnets, which are in general much smaller than that of the whole original net system. This method in general reduces significantly the computational overhead of designing a liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor. A subnet can be further decomposed in a hierarchical way, which can further mitigate the computational burden. Typical examples are used to demonstrate the proposed methods.",

The fluid resistance and heat transfer performance of microchannels are analyzed and investigated based on this experimental apparatus. It is shown that classical macroscopic formulas are not applicable for calculating friction resistance and heat exchange coefficients when channel hydraulic diameter is 381 \u03bcm.

The deadlock avoidance policy of Conjunctive/Disjunctive Resources Upstream Neighborhood (C/D-RUN) is applied to the siphon-based deadlock prevention policy, and the resources of the control places are allocated reasonably to guarantee the absence of deadlock states and processes. First, strict minimal siphons of an S3PR are divided into elementary and dependent ones. From the set of elementary siphons, a set of linear inequality constraints expressed by the state vector can be formalized, and after being modified by the C/D-RUN policy, a set of generalized mutual exclusion constraints (GMEC) expressed by the marking vector can be found. Then monitors based on the marking constraints are added to the plant model to ensure that all elementary siphons in the S3PR net are invariant-controlled, thus leading to a deadlock freedom liveness-enforcing supervisor with a simple structure and much permissive behavior can be realized.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the deadlock problems in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) by using a Petri net siphon control method and the theory of regions. The proposed policy consists of two stages. The first one, called siphons control, is to add, for every siphon that we identify, a monitor to the original net model such that it is optimally invariant controlled. In the second stage, the theory of regions is utilized to derive the net supervisors such that deadlocks can be prevented. The first-stage work significantly lowers the computational cost compared with the approach where the theory of regions is used alone. An FMS example is presented to illustrate the technique. By varying the markings of given net structures, this paper shows its computational advantages.",

Reasonably, many of the realistic general mutual exclusion constraints (GMECs) imposed on these discrete models should be timed rather than merely algebraic or logic. In the past, such a problem was studied on the basis of the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control technique (SCT) and the theory of regions. It proves to be NP-hard since it necessitates the generation of reachability graphs. This paper shows that it can be solvable in polynomial time by using generalized linear constraints, which are originally proposed to increase the expressive power of the linear marking constraints. By dividing each constraint into marking, firing vector, and Parikh terms, its respective control place can be synthesized algebraically without considering the separation of dangerous states and events. Several examples are used to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Control of a large-scale automated manufacturing system is an important and challenging issue. Its discrete event system model represented by Petri nets tends to become highly complicated in structure, especially when there exist uncontrollable or unobservable events. The existing approaches are nontrivial to design both efficient and maximally permissive supervisors to impose constraints on an overall system. In this paper, instead of considering the control problem from an overall system perspective, we intend to transform an overall control problem into the one designing multiple controllers in parallel, each of which is much simpler in structure. A Petri net structure is decomposed via integer linear programming or a polynomial decomposition method to obtain multiple state-machine subnets that constitute a decentralized system. A necessary and sufficient condition for preserving the equivalence in terms of states and behaviors between the overall system and its decentralized version is reported. Constraints representing control requirements are further converted and enforced in the respective subnets. Then, supervisors are generated via a generalized mutual exclusion constraint method. By considering the deviations between the subnet control and overall control, this paper formulates a communication mechanism to guarantee that the decentralized system runs in an appropriate manner. Finally, two examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed approach.",

It is pointed out that the equivalent transverse load depends on the edge electric field distribution of parallel plate capacitor. The expression of the neutral plane in the piezoelectric composite laminates is derived.

The observed system output is defined as a transition-marking sequence, i.e., each transition is followed by a marking. First, a nonlinear integer programming model that characterizes the faults modeled by fault transitions is built according to the abnormal behavior extracted from the observed sequence. Then, it is converted into an integer linear programming (ILP) problem and a faulty net that preserves the structure of the fault-free one is obtained by solving this ILP model. In addition, an algorithm is developed to ensure acyclicity of the resulting unobservable subnet whose transition set is composed of the unobservable transitions of the fault-free net and the identified fault transitions.",

Extending the    $L^*$   learning algorithm, an    $S^*$   algorithm is developed to infer a tentatively correct supervisor. If the tentatively correct supervisor is nonblocking, it is indeed the supremal nonblocking supervisor with respect to the plant and specifications. Otherwise, the blocking automaton is regarded as a new plant, and the specification is the nonblocking property. Then, the supremal nonblocking supervisor with respect to the new problem is computed using supervisory control theory of DES. Two simplification rules are introduced to the    $S^*$   algorithm to decrease the computational cost. Finally, the   $S^*$   algorithm is implemented based on the LearnLib framework, and experiments are performed to verify the proposed approach.",

Petri net is an effective way to model, analyze, and control deadlocks in FMS. Proposed by our previous work, elementary siphons are an efficient method to investigate the deadlock problems in Petri nets.

Also this research presents an analysis to show the advantages of elementary siphons in the design of liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisors. By analyzing the deadlock control problems in three different scale FMS examples, this paper shows that our policy always leads to structurally simple liveness-enforcing net supervisors. Moreover, the superiority of our approach can be clearly shown by large scale FMS.",

Resources are assumed to be renewable, i.e., they are not consumed by the operations and become available again after they have been released. The systems under consideration are modeled by a subclass of timed Petri nets called deterministic timed weighted marked graphs. In addition, we take into account infinite server semantics, i.e., the degree of self-concurrency of each transition is infinite. We propose an approach that provides an optimal solution, but has a high computational cost. For this reason, we also present two different approaches that can find suboptimal solutions with a reduced computational cost. The performances of the proposed approaches are compared by means of numerical simulations.",

The analysis of such a system leads us to characterise the deadlock situations in terms of the insufficiently marked siphons in its generalised Petri-net model. The proposed policy is carried out in an iterative way. At each step a minimal siphon is derived from a maximal deadly marked siphon that is found by solving a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. An algorithm is formalised that can efficiently compute such a minimal siphon from a maximal one. A monitor is added for a derived minimal siphon such that it is max-controlled if it is elementary with respect to the siphons that have been derived. The liveness of the controlled system is decided by the fact that no siphon can be derived due to the MIP solution. After a liveness-enforcing net supervisor computed without complete siphon enumeration, the output-arcs of the additional monitors are rearranged such that the monitors act while restricting the system less. Examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a type of specifications called OR-AND Generalized Mutual Exclusion Constraints (GMEC) for place/transition nets is defined. Such a specification consists of a disjunction of conjunction of several single GMECs, i.e, the requirement is that, at any given time, the controlled system should satisfy at least one set of conjunctive GMECs. We show that a bounded OR-AND GMEC can be enforced by a special control structure composed by a set of AND-GMEC monitor places plus a switcher that determines the current active ones. We also show that such a simple control structure can be modified to ensure maximal permissiveness. This approach can be used in the framework of supervisory control in Petri nets.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a deadlock prevention method to design a maximally permissive liveness-enforcing pure Petri net supervisor for a discrete event system, if such a supervisor exists; otherwise, it obtains the most permissive one in the sense that no other pure liveness-enforcing supervisors via linear monitors can be more permissive than it. This paper exploits an iterative method. At each iteration, a first-met bad marking (FBM) is singled out and an integer linear programming problem (ILPP) is configured. If a feasible solution can be found for the ILPP, then a place invariant (PI) is designed to prohibit the FBM from being reached while no legal marking is forbidden. If the ILPP has no solution, we collect all these FBMs that cannot be optimally controlled. For each of such FBMs, another ILPP is designed to find the least number of legal markings whose reachability conditions contradict the current considered FBM and enumerate all the optimal solutions of this ILPP. Based on it, we develop a 0-1 linear programming problem to find the maximal number of legal markings after removing all the contradictory legal markings. Then, the new sets of legal markings and FBMs are obtained, and we return to the iteration stage to redesign a PI to control each FBM if the ILPP has a feasible solution. Repeat the above process until no FBM can be reached. Finally, a most permissive pure liveness-enforcing supervisor via linear monitors is derived. Two Petri net models are used to illustrate the proposed method.",

First, an improved siphon-based liveness characterization for the Petri nets modeling C/D-RAS is proposed. Subsequently, this characterization facilitates the utilization of a mixed integer programming (MIP) based deadlock prevention policy that can well avoid the explicit enumeration of both siphons and the reachable states. The resulting policy is implemented by an iterative algorithm each step of which is characterized as an MIP formulation in conjunction with both a bad marking detection and a feedback control operation. Finally, the deadlock prevention policy developed in this paper is, respectively, characterized by the local and global ones so as to realize a trade-off between the behavior permissiveness and the structural simplicity of the supervisor.

        "title": "AHP, Gray Correlation, and TOPSIS Combined Approach to Green Performance Evaluation of Design Alternatives.",
        "abstract": "The green design of electromechanical products is a pivotal link to manufacturing industry. The question on how to design green products must be answered by excellent designers using both advanced design methods and effective assessment techniques of design alternatives. Making an objective and precise assessment of green designs is of increasing importance to ensure sustainable development. This work proposes a framework based on the combination of analytical hierarchy process (AHP), gray correlation (GC), and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate the performance of design alternatives. AHP is used to determine the weights of performance indices and a nonlinear programming model with constraints is proposed to obtain the integrated closeness index based on the similarity closeness index from GC and distance closeness index from TOPSIS. A case study, i.e., three kinds of refrigerators, is illustrated to verify the proposed method. By comparing with existing methods, i.e., AHP-TOPSIS and AHP-GC, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been confirmed. In addition, sensitivity analysis is also provided in order to assess the robustness of the proposed method. Also, the following implication can be obtained from our results: 1) chloro\u2013fluoro\u2013carbons (mg/   $text{m}^{3}$   ) (C 1 ), production noise (dB) (C 6 ), and environmental cost (C 16 ) have a large impact on refrigerator\u2019s green design since these factors carry relatively larger weights. Results of the sensitivity analysis from different cases demonstrate that the best alternative may change when different weights are assigned to the evaluation criteria. This finding means the importance of establishing a qualified group of experts/designers in design evaluation and 2) the selection of design alternatives to produce a green product is critical to product development. The main contribution of this paper is the definition and development of an effective evaluation framework to guide managers to assess product design alternatives. The results show that it overcomes the one-sidedness of AHP-TOPSIS and AHP-GC, and makes the evaluation results more objective and realistic. It provides an accurate, effective, and systematic decision support tool for green performance evaluation of product design alternatives.",

However, few of them can quantitatively optimize certain indices during their supervisor synthesis process. This causes unnecessary control limitations and often leads to high implementation cost. In the framework of Petri nets, this paper proposes a method to synthesize a cost-effective supervisor with the aid of a set of mathematical programming formulations.

For a class of Petri nets called Systems of Simple Sequential Processes with Resources $(\\hbox{S}^{3}\\hbox{PR})$, the resource circuit-based method is an effective way to compute SMS. In this paper, a more effective one to compute SMS is proposed. First, the concepts of loop resource subsets and their characteristic resource subnets are proposed. Next, sufficient and necessary conditions for loop resource subsets to generate SMS are established. Finally, an algorithm is given to find all the SMS based on loop resource subsets. Since the number of loop resource subsets is much less than that of resource circuits and their combinations, the computational efficiency of the SMS enumeration task is significantly improved by the proposed method. An FMS example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method, and computational time comparisons are provided on several $\\hbox{S}^{3}\\hbox{PR}$ s to show its superior efficiency.",

In order to suppress deadlock occurrences in AMS, a method to derive the bad markings iteratively using a mixed integer programming-based algorithm is proposed. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, two examples were demonstrated in Hu (Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control 33:59\u201376, 2011). This paper shows that the uncontrolled Petri net model in one of the examples is incorrect. It is also shown that the structural complexity of the computed monitors for both examples can be reduced with the same or more permissive system behaviours.",

Based on siphons, a variety of techniques are developed for the deadlock problems in concurrent systems. The major disadvantage of the existing approaches is that the number of siphons that have to be considered is large or grows fast as these methods proceed. This unavoidably leads to structurally complex deadlock-free Petri net supervisors. This research explores ways to minimize the number of siphons that have to be controlled. In this paper, siphons are distinguished by elementary and redundant ones. Conditions are developed, under which a redundant siphon can always be marked if its elementary siphons are controlled. This research is of significance to reduce the complexity of the analysis and design of liveness enforcing Petri net supervisors.",

An interval inhibitor arc is an arc from a place to a transition labeled with an integer interval. The transition is disabled by the place if the number of tokens in the place is between the labeled interval. The formal definition and the firing rules of Petri nets with interval inhibitor arcs are developed. Then, an optimal Petri net supervisor based on the interval inhibitor arcs is designed to prevent a system from reaching illegal markings. Two techniques are developed to simplify the supervisory structure by compressing the number of control places. The proposed approaches are general since they can be applied to any bounded Petri net models. A marking reduction approach is also introduced if they are applied to Petri net models of flexible manufacturing systems. Finally, a number of examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed approaches and the experimental results show that they can obtain optimal Petri net supervisors for some net models that cannot be optimally controlled by pure net supervisors. Furthermore, the obtained supervisor is structurally simple.",

        "abstract": "This paper handles the optimal supervisory control problem of Petri nets (PNs) via two PN structures, namely, weighted and data inhibitor arcs. It is a two-stage method. In the first stage, for each transition that may lead to illegal markings, a set of observer places with weighted inhibitor arcs is used to optimally control the maximal number of marking/transition separation instances (MTSIs) through the proposed integer linear program. Then, the controlled MTSIs are removed from the set of MTSIs. In the second stage, at each iteration, for an MTSI that cannot be controlled at the first control stage, we design an optimal observer place with a data inhibitor arc. This process terminates after all the MTSIs are controlled. The first-stage can sharply lower the computational burden compared with the method by using data inhibitor arcs alone. Finally, a typical example is presented to shed light on this technique. The proposed control strategy can definitely yield an optimal supervisor for any bounded PN on the premise that such a supervisor exists.",

As an extension to supervisory control theory, a new framework, state-tree structures (STS), has been deployed to manage the state explosion problem of SCDES. This paper aims to address this notorious issue of supervisory control with partial observation in the STS framework by state feedback control that calculates the controllers of the controllable-observable events only, which is realized by the following two steps. First, for a specification represented as a predicate, a supremal normal subpredicate that requires only the controllable-observable events enabled/disabled, is computed. Second, according to the new transition function constructed by the natural projection of the given STS, the supremal nonblocking, weakly controllable subpredicate is obtained from the supremal normal subpredicate. The proposed approach based on STS provides the possibility to supervise controllable events under partial observation in large-scale systems with the state explosion problem managed. An example with state size over 10 7  that leads to program crashes in SCDES can be solved in this paper. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the industrial applications of the contribution of this research, three examples are addressed.",

        "abstract": "This work studies the scheduling problem of a single-arm multicluster tool with a linear topology and process-bound bottleneck individual tool. The objective is to find a one-wafer cyclic schedule such that the lower bound of cycle time is reached by optimally configuring spaces in buffering modules that link individual cluster tools. A Petri net (PN) model is developed to describe the dynamic behavior of the system by extending resource-oriented PNs such that a schedule can be parameterized by robots' waiting time. Based on this model, conditions are presented under which a one-wafer cyclic schedule with the lower bound of cycle time can be found. With the derived conditions, an algorithm is developed to find such a schedule and optimally configure buffer spaces. The algorithm requires only simple calculation to set the robots' waiting time and buffer size. Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed method.",

The major disadvantage of the existing approaches is that the number of siphons that have to be considered is large or grows fast as these methods proceed. In this paper, we investigate the deadlock prevention problem in a class of Petri net (PN), S3PR, where siphons are distinguished by elementary and redundant ones. For each elementary siphon, a monitor is added to prevent it from being emptied without generating emptiable control-induced siphons. The results show that a more permissive liveness enforcing Petri net supervisor with a small number of additional monitors can be obtained by our deadlock control policy.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing numbers of cars and trips in cites, energy consumption and environmental pollution have become key problems of urban transport. In particular, the increasing use of private cars not only causes more energy consumption and produces more exhaust, but also makes the transportation structure unbalanced. Thus, a rationalized transport structure must be established and optimized to promote the sustainable development of urban transport. This paper presents some energy-efficiency models of sustainable urban transport structure optimization. Their objective functions are to minimize the energy consumption, and their constraints are carbon dioxide emission and traffic efficiency. The models were solved via the artificial fish swarm algorithm and used to optimize the urban transport structure of Harbin city in China. The results indicate that the models can not only guarantee the benefit of travelers and reduce the carbon emission, but also minimize energy consumption of the urban transportation.",

        "abstract": "Petri nets has been proved to be a tool with strong abilities to describe discrete dynamic event systems (DEDS) such as flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) for their excellent properties over most of other tools. Siphons arising in Petri nets can be used to illustrate, analyze and control deadlock phenomena in FMS. Due to the deficiency of siphons, which is well known, elementary siphons come to be an important concept in Petri net theory, which is of great significance in designing structurally simple supervisors for plant net models. Our previous work has demonstrated that different sets of elementary siphons may lead to different effects in terms of the reachable states or the behaviors of controlled net systems, and the one leads to the maximal number of reachable states is denoted as an optimal set of elementary siphons. In this paper, algorithms to generate the optimal set of elementary siphons with high computational efficiency are well discussed and developed. Experimental results show that the optimal set of elementary siphons may produce more permissive behaviors in the controlled net system when the same deadlock control policies are applied",

        "abstract": "Observation structures considered for Petri net generators usually assume that the firing of transitions may be observed through a static mask and that the marking of some places may be measurable. These observation structures, however, are rather limited, namely they do not cover all cases of practical interest where complex observations are possible. We consider in this paper more general ones, by correspondingly defining two new classes of Petri net generators: labeled Petri nets with outputs (LPNOs) and adaptive labeled Petri nets (ALPNs). To compare the modeling power of different Petri net generators, the notion of observation equivalence is proposed. ALPNs are shown to be the class of bounded generators possessing the highest modeling power. Looking for bridges between the different formalisms, we first present a general procedure to convert a bounded LPNO into an equivalent ALPN or even into an equivalent labeled Petri net (if any exists). Finally, we discuss the possibility of converting an unbounded LPNO into an equivalent ALPN.",

An operator observes the plant through an observation mask that does not allow him to detect the occurrence of certain events (silent events).

We construct an attack structure  $A$  which guarantees that, when the plant reaches an unsafe state,  $A$  can make the operator think that the plant is in a safe state. Based on  $A$ , we can obtain a stealthy attack structure  $A_{s}$  by simply removing from  $A$  all the exposing states, all the weakly exposing states and their input and output arcs.

Most of the previous works focus on solving the problem of influence maximization, which aims to identify a small subset of early adopters in a social network to maximize the influence propagation under a given diffusion model. On the contrary in this paper, motivated by real-world scenarios, we propose two different influence minimization problems. We consider a linear threshold diffusion model and provide a general solution to the first problem by solving an integer linear programming problem. For the second problem, we provide a technique to search for an optimal solution that works only in particular cases and discuss a simple heuristic to find a solution in the general case. Several simulations on real datasets are also presented.",

        "abstract": "Current-state opacity is a key security property in discrete event systems. A system is said to be current-state opaque if the intruder, who only has partial observations on the systemu0027s evolution, is never able to infer that the current state of the system is within a set of secret states. In this work, we address the problem of enforcing current-state opacity by supervisory control. Given a system that is modeled with a finite automaton and that is not current-state opaque with respect to a given secret, the enforcement problem consists in designing a supervisor so that the controlled system is current-state opaque. We assume that the supervisor can only observe and control a subset of events. To be more general, we assume no specific containment relationship exists between the sets of events that can be observed by the intruder and the supervisor, respectively. We call this general setting uncomparable observations. We show that the maximally permissive supervisor always exists and propose a novel approach for its design.",

Then, two integer linear programming problems (ILPPs) are formulated. Based on the first ILPP, an iterative deadlock control policy is developed, where a control place is computed at each iteration to implement as many marking/transition separation instances (MTSIs) as possible. The second ILPP can find a set of control places to implement all MTSIs and the objective function is used to minimize the number of control places. It is a non-iterative deadlock control strategy since we need to solve the ILPP only once. Both ILPPs can make all legal markings reachable in the controlled system, i.e., the obtained supervisor is behaviorally optimal. Finally, we provide examples to illustrate the proposed approaches.",

        "abstract": "The deadlock control of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) has been widely studied in the literature. Petri nets (PNs) are extensively used as a tool for modelling, analysis and controller synthesis of such systems. In general, Petri-net-based liveness enforcing supervisors (LESs) include control places (CPs) together with their input/output arcs. It is well known that the methods proposed for computing CPs may provide redundant and necessary CPs. In this paper, a new method is proposed for redundancy test of CPs by means of supervisory control theory (SCT). The proposed method is based on the idea that after the removal of a CP from an LES, if the controlled model is still live, then the removed CP is redundant. The proposed method makes use of the TCT implementation tool of SCT. It is applicable to a PN-based LES consisting of a set of CPs. The applicability of proposed method is demonstrated by means of examples from the relevant literature. For some examples, the redundancy test provides more permi...",

Some properties of an ordinary Petri net are not always inherited in its extended version with inhibitor arcs. This paper reports a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding the structurally live property in an original Petri net and its extended one with inhibitor arcs. In addition, supposing that a net is structurally live, a natural problem is how to distribute the minimal number of tokens into the structurally live net to ensure that the marked net is live. A method is developed to find an optimal token allocation solution by putting tokens only in some key places. The algorithm can be completed within polynomial time, which overcomes the drawback of exhaustive solutions from all possible markings.

        "abstract": "SummaryFor the linear parameter varying systems with bounded disturbance, a saturated dynamic output feedback controller is designed by specifically considering input saturation, to stabilize the closed-loop system. The controller parameters and the corresponding region of attraction are calculated by solving an off-line optimization problem with respect to input saturation, state constraints, and robust stability. In the off-line optimization problem, both the unknown and available scheduling parameters are considered for the linear parameter varying systems. When the unknown scheduling parameters are considered, the off-line optimization problem is nonconvex and can be solved by the cone complementary linearization method. When the available scheduling parameters are considered, the off-line optimization problem can be reformulated as convex optimization due to the parameter dependent form of controller parameters. In the both cases, input saturation is specifically handled by introducing a set of linear matrix inequalities into the off-line optimization problem, which can reduce the conservatism of the controller design and fully exploit the controller capability. Based on the real-time estimated state, system output, and scheduling parameters, the actual input can be obtained by saturating the dynamic output feedback controller, and steer the augmented state quickly converge to the neighborhood of the origin. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the proposed approaches.",

This study addresses a two-agent stochastic flow shop deteriorating scheduling problem with the objectives of minimizing the makespan of the first agent and the total tardiness of the second agent. In the investigated problem, the normal processing time of jobs is a random variable, and the actual processing time of jobs is a linear function of their normal processing time and starting time. To solve this problem efficiently, this study proposes a hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm which is a combination of an evolutionary algorithm and a local search method. It maintains two populations and one archive. The two populations are utilized to execute the global and local searches, where one population employs an evolutionary algorithm to explore the whole solution space, and the other applies a local search method to exploit the promising regions. The archive is used to guide the computation resource allocation in the search process. Some special techniques, i.e., evolutionary methods, local search methods and information exchange strategies between two populations, are designed to enhance the exploration and exploitation ability. Comparing with the classical and popular multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on some test instances, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce satisfactory solution for the investigated problem.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive probabilistic systems have ability to modify their behaviors to cope with unpredictable significant changes at run-time such as component failures or resources depletion. Reconfiguration is often a major task for systems, i.e., it may violate the memory usage, the required energy and the concerned real-time constraints. It might also make the system\u2019s functions unavailable for some time and make potential harm to human life or large financial investments. Thus, updating a system with any new configuration requires that the post-reconfigurable system fully satisfies the related constraints. Formal modeling and verification could avoid the resources and constraints violation. Thus, the paper proposes a new formalism to specify such systems. We also develop a new visual environment named ZIZO which helps in modeling, constructive simulation and CTL-based verification of adaptive probabilistic systems. The contributions are used to guarantee the resources and correctness of an IPv4 ZeroConf protocol.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Joint object tracking and pose estimation is an important issue in Augmented Reality (AR), interactive systems, and robotic systems. Many studies are based on object detection methods that only focus on the reliability of the features. Other methods combine object detection with frame-by-frame tracking using the temporal redundancy in the video. However, in some mixed methods, the interval between consecutive detection frames is usually too short to take the full advantage of the frame-by-frame tracking, or there is no appropriate switching mechanism between detection and tracking. In this paper, an iterative optimization tracking method is proposed to alleviate the deviations of the tracking points and prolong the interval, and thus speed up the pose estimation process. Moreover, an adaptive detection interval algorithm is developed, which can make the switch between detection and frame-by-frame tracking automatically according to the quality of frames so as to improve the accuracy in a tough tracking environment. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset manifest that the proposed algorithms, as an independent part, can be combined with some inter-frame tracking methods for optimization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Manufacturers\u2019 operation strategies become considerably complicated due to more frequent product updating in the Internet economics. This paper deals with the multi-stage problem of pricing and time-to-market for multi-generation products sold through an online direct channel in a service supply chain with a manufacturer and a logistics service provider. The manufacturer introduces a new generation of products before the present one exits market. The old generation of product may or may not exit the market before the end of the sales period. The service provider is in charge of the logistics service from the manufacturer to the consumers. The manufacturer\u2019s optimal pricing and introduction time strategies and the logistics service provider\u2019s optimal service pricing strategy can be derived. When the substitution rate of a new product to an old one is closer to a threshold, the greater the competition between them, and therefore the lower their optimal prices and the sooner the old product exits market. Moreover, the optimal time-to-market for the new product is decreasing with the potential market share of two generations of products in the second stage. In addition, higher quality which leads to higher costs makes the product enter the market later. Finally, we use numerical examples to illustrate the strategies.",

Both players benefit from the successful allocation whenever the scheme presented by the proposer is endorsed by the responder, yet both receive nothing otherwise. Meanwhile, the responder in the Dictator Game has no choice but to accept what is offered by the proposer. As both games may occur in some realistic situations, we study the population dynamics by considering the mixture of the Ultimatum Game and the Dictator Game. Mixture means a fraction of individuals play the Dictator Game with their partners while others play the Ultimatum game. We introduce degree-related assignment rules to determine who shall play the Dictator Game in the heterogeneous populations. Our results show that the evolution of fairness can be promoted by assigning an appropriate fraction of hubs to be dictators, a novel finding deviating from the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium where proposers tend to leave next to nothing to their responders. Our work highlights the importance of network reciprocity in enhancing the evolution of fairness.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method of computing a minimal supervisory structure that optimally enforces liveness on the Petri net models for flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). The proposed method utilizes the structural properties of a Petri net model to avoid the computation of its reachability graph, which in general leads to the state explosion problem. This paper aims to design a single control place for each concurrent process of a Petri net model or a sub-net model, which thus provides a constant number of control places in a supervisor regardless of the number of resource places in a Petri net or sub-net model. It is shown that the structural size of a supervisor is minimal as the number of control places depends on the number of concurrent processes in the Petri net model. Precisely, two algorithms are developed in this paper. The first aims to compute active uncontrolled transitions and the second is concerned with a method to compute the generalized mutual exclusion constraints (GMECs) for each process of the Petri net model of an FMS. Furthermore, it provides an approach to design control places for each computed GMEC without solving integer linear programming problems, which greatly reduces the computational costs. When the computed control places are coupled with the uncontrolled Petri net model for an FMS, it optimally enforces liveness behavior of the Petri net model, and hence ensures the high utilization of resources in a considered system.",

        "abstract": "The deadlock control problem in automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) has received much attention in recent years due to the flexibility of an AMS. In the framework of Petri nets, resource-transition circuits and siphons are often used to characterize and derive a deadlock control policy for an AMS. This paper mainly focuses on a class of Petri nets, namely, the system of simple sequential processes with resources, which contains some special resource places. For such a class of Petri nets, the relationship between a multi-step look-ahead deadlock avoidance control method and the structure of the model is established and expanded in a mathematical way. Unlike the one-step look-ahead deadlock avoidance policy (DAP) proposed in the literature, the DAPs reported in this research are applicable to more complex situations, including a model with one-unit resource shared by two or more perfect resource-transition circuits that do not contain each other. Compared with the existing work, some results are archived for expanded models. Finally, for the model with two shared one-unit resources, specific solutions are also presented. Meanwhile, examples are used to demonstrate the proposed results.",

        "abstract": "For an automated manufacturing system (AMS), it is a computationally intractable problem to find a maximally permissive deadlock avoidance policy (DAP) in a general case, since the decision on the safety of a reachable state is NP-hard. This paper focuses on the deadlock avoidance problem for systems of simple sequential processes with resources (S3PR) by using Petri nets structural analysis theory. Inspired by the one-step look-ahead DAP that is an established result, which is of polynomial complexity, for an S3PR without one-unit-capacity resources shared by two or more resource-transition circuits (in the Petri net model) that do not include each other, this research explores a multiple-step look-ahead deadlock avoidance policy for a system modeled with an S3PR that contains a shared one-unit-capacity resource in resource-transition circuits. It is shown that the development of an optimal DAP for the considered class of Petri nets is also of polynomial complexity. It is indicated that the steps needed to look ahead in a DAP depend on the structure of the net model. A number of examples are used to illustrate the proposed method.",

The proposed method utilizes the structural properties of the Petri net model to avoid the computation of its reachability graph which in general leads to the state explosion problem. Three algorithms are developed. The first and second algorithms aim to compute first-met and n-met uncontrolled transitions, respectively, in an iterative manner until all the n-met uncontrolled transitions are found in the plant net model. The third algorithm is used to design n-transition controllers iteratively. The iteration terminates when all the transitions in the set of uncontrolled transitions are processed. The addition of the n-transition controllers to the plant net model is to make the n-met uncontrolled transitions controlled. The transition controllers are capable of enforcing liveness to the plant net model with all its reachable markings...",

The transition set of a Petri net is partitioned into the subsets of explicit and implicit transitions in such a way that the subnet induced by implicit transitions does not contain directed cycles. The firing of implicit transitions can be abstracted so that the reachability set of the net can be completely characterized by a subset of reachable markings called basis makings. We show that to determine a max-cardinality-TI basis partition is an NP-hard problem, but a max-set-TI basis partition can be determined in polynomial time. The generalized version of the marking reachability problem in a Petri net can be solved by a practically efficient algorithm based on the basis reachability graph. Finally, this approach is further extended to unbounded nets.",

We show that given an arbitrary net and a set of legal markings, the admissible marking set cannot always be represented by a finite number of disjunctions of GMECs. Moreover, we characterize the GMEC inflation phenomenon, that is, the case in which the representation of the admissible marking set may be too complex to be efficiently implemented in a closed-loop net. To rule out the possibility of GMEC inflation we consider a subclass of constraints called singular GMECs with an acyclic backward-conflict-free uncontrollable subnet. By these assumptions we propose an algorithm to transform a given singular GMEC into a controllable OR-GMEC which precisely characterizes its admissible marking set.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a general discrete-event system (DES)-based hard periodic real-time task model. Based on supervisory control theory (SCT), an optimal priority-free real-time scheduling technique is proposed to process all the tasks running in uniprocessor or multiprocessor real-time systems (RTS). The preemption relation in this paper generalizes priority-based preemption. First, regular languages are utilized to describe the processor behavior related to each task's execution. Thereafter, the languages are represented by DES generators. Finally, the global processor behavior is generated as the synchronous product of these DES generators. By discarding the priorities, a novel preemption policy, namely conditional-preemption, is developed. Two sets of conditional-preemption specifications are developed, on the processor level and task level, respectively. Moreover, in order to control the system to be nonblocking and also limit the worst-case response time of the tasks, two corresponding sets of specifications are presented. After generating the global specification as the synchronous product, by implementing SCT the calculated supervisor can provide all the safe real-time execution sequences. The supervisor calculation can be sped up by a three-step algorithm. Finally, the real-time scheduling is implemented for real-world examples.",

        "abstract": "In order to cope with uncertainties in a platoon, this paper proposes a reconfigurable multi-agent architecture to address the platoon safety problem by handling two modes: the normal mode and the degraded mode. At this stage of research, the normal mode is characterized by the interaction between agents over a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication network while the degraded mode simply involves sensors for a local perception. The switching from the normal mode to the degraded one is triggered when the communication quality is considered not fully reliable. A PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controller is proposed to regulate the inter-vehicle distance and orientation. Two models are proposed in this paper: in the first one, the management operations such as splitting and joining are set up while the second is mainly modeled to assess the implemented controller quality. In this paper, the safety of a platoon is represented by the quality of tracking and the inter-vehicle distance. The mentioned features are assessed for both modes through a formal verification using the Uppaal software. We prove the efficiency of the proposed platoon model for several situations such as merging, following or leaving the platoon by verifying different properties using the model checking. The evaluation of the second model, simulated by the Webots software, proves the impact of the number of vehicles on the platoon performance and the vehicle tracking quality. We conclude that when the platoon reaches a certain number of vehicles, the safety criterion is no more reliable.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the synthesis of Petri net supervisors based on a think-globally-act-locally (TGAL) approach and a vector covering technique for flexible manufacturing systems. Given a Petri net model with deadlocks, the TGAL approach first temporarily adds a global idle place (GP). A GP has initially only one token. Then, we generate the reachability graph of the net model with the GP. If there are deadlocks, we find all the legal markings and first-met bad markings (FBMs). The legal markings and FBMs that need to be considered can be reduced by using a vector covering approach. An integer linear programming problem is formulated to design a set of control places to forbid all FBMs but no legal markings. Meanwhile, the redundancy of the obtained control places is checked to remove the redundant ones. Then, we increase one token in the GP and compute a set of control place again. This process is carried out until the reachable markings of the Petri net model do not increase when the number of tokens in the GP is increased. As a result, we can find a set of control places to make the Petri net model live. Finally, some Petri net examples from the literature are used to demonstrate the proposed methods. It can be verified that the obtained supervisors can lead to more reachable markings, since the obtained control places are maximally permissive at each iteration.",

        "abstract": "To improve the power supply availability in an island microgrid, this paper proposes a new approach that integrates distributed energy sources economically, reliably and efficiently. In an island mode, a microgrid must ensure its self-sufficiency of energy production since it cannot make an energetic exchange with a main grid. However, in this mode, the random behavior of the resources affected by meteorological factors presents a major constraint. The challenge related to the power availability in microgrids is to find a solution that faces the operation of intermittent power sources. The microgrid should guarantee a useful power management in order to achieve a high availability of energy. In this paper, we present a mathematical model to describe the influence of the meteorological factors on the sources production. We propose a multi-agent control strategy based on the production forecasting and load shedding for a high availability of the microgrid power supply. The proposed multi-agent system uses the master-slave model in which the communication and negotiation between the defined agents are performed by a concept of tokens. The developed control system is implemented on Spartan 6 FPGA-Board. The paper's contribution is applied to a Tunisian petroleum platform where several blackouts are recorded between 2012 and 2014. Simulation and experimental results show clearly a high availability as a performance of the proposed control strategy.",

The principle of justifiable granularity offers a conceptually and algorithmically attractive way of designing information granule completed on a basis of some experimental evidence (especially present in the form of numeric data). This paper builds upon the existing principle and presents its significant generalization, referred here as an adaptive principle of justifiable information granularity. The method supports a granular data aggregation producing an optimal information granule (with the optimality expressed in terms of the criteria of coverage and specificity commonly used when characterizing quality of information granules). The flexibility of the method stems from an introduction of the adaptive weighting scheme of the data leading to a vector of weights used in the construction of the optimal information granule. A detailed design procedure is provided along with the required optimization vehicle (realized with the aid of the population-based optimization techniques, such as particle swarm optimization and differential evolution). Two direct application areas in which the principle becomes of direct usage include prediction of time series and prediction of spatial data. In both cases, it is advocated that the results formed by the principle are reflective of the precision (quality) of the prediction process.",

Given a set of system states (the secret), a system observation is called initial-state opaque if an agent (named intruder), who can partially observe the system, cannot determine whether the set of initial states consistent with the observation is a subset of the secret. Such a property can describe security problems in cyber-infrastructures, such as Internet and mobile communication networks or national defense service systems. This work presents a novel on-line methodology to verify the notion of initial-state opacity in discrete event systems that are modeled by labeled Petri nets. By working on-line, the intruder waits for the occurrence of an observable event and exploits integer linear programming problem to verify the initial-state opacity for the system's evolution under the given observation. A set of examples are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of the presented method.",

        "title": "Model based urban traffic control, part II: Coordinated model predictive controllers",
        "abstract": "Abstract   The present paper describes how to use coordination between neighbouring intersections in order to improve the performance of urban traffic controllers. Both the local MPC (LMPC) introduced in the companion paper (Hao et al., 2018) and the coordinated MPC (CMPC) introduced in this paper use the urban cell transmission model (UCTM) (Hao et al., 2018) in order to predict the average delay of vehicles in the upstream links of each intersection, for different scenarios of switching times of the traffic lights at that intersection. The feedback controller selects the next switching times of the traffic light corresponding to the shortest predicted average delay. While the local MPC (Hao et al., 2018) only uses local measurements of traffic in the links connected to the intersection in comparing the performance of different scenarios, the CMPC approach improves the accuracy of the performance predictions by allowing a control agent to exchange information about planned switching times with control agents at all neighbouring intersections. Compared to local MPC the offline information on average flow rates from neighbouring intersections is replaced in coordinated MPC by additional online information on when the neighbouring intersections plan to send vehicles to the intersection under control. To achieve good coordination planned switching times should not change too often, hence a cost for changing planned schedules from one decision time to the next decision time is added to the cost function. In order to improve the stability properties of CMPC a prediction of the sum of squared queue sizes is used whenever some downstream queues of an intersection become too long. Only scenarios that decrease this sum of squares of local queues are considered for possible implementation. This stabilization criterion is shown experimentally to further improve the performance of our controller. In particular it leads to a significant reduction of the queues that build up at the edges of the traffic region under control. We compare via simulation the average delay of vehicles travelling on a simple 4 by 4 Manhattan grid, for traffic lights with pre-timed control, traffic lights using the local MPC controller (Hao et al., 2018), and coordinated MPC (with and without the stabilizing condition). These simulations show that the proposed CMPC achieves a significant reduction in delay for different traffic conditions in comparison to these other strategies.",

An event-triggered communication scheme is used in the control process to overcome the disadvantages of continuous communication. Meanwhile, the weight estimates of all neural networks (NNs) also converge to a small neighborhood of their optimal values, and the generalization ability of NNs is well guaranteed. Specifically, the trigger condition of each agent is only dependent on its own NN weight estimate. It is proved that the inter-event times are lower bounded by a positive constant to avoid the accumulation of events. Finally, a numerical example is provided to substantiate the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper is the first in a series of reports presenting a framework for the hierarchical design of feedback controllers for traffic lights in urban networks. The goal of the research is to develop an easy to understand methodology for designing model based feedback controllers that use the current state estimate in order to select the next switching times of traffic lights. In this paper we introduce an extension of the cell transmission model that describes with sufficient accuracy the major causes of delay for urban traffic. We show that this model is computationally fast enough such that it can be used in a model predictive controller that decides for each intersection, taking into account the vehicle density as estimated along all links connected to the intersection, what switching time minimizes the local delay for all vehicles over a prediction horizon of a few minutes. The implementation of this local MPC only requires local online measurements and local model information (unlike the coordinated MPC, to be introduced in the next paper in this series, that takes into account interactions between neighbouring intersections). We study the performance of the proposed local MPC via simulation on a simple 4 by 4 Manhattan grid, comparing its delay with an efficiently tuned pretimed control for the traffic lights, and with traffic lights controlled according to the max pressure rule. These simulations show that the proposed local MPC controller achieves a significant reduction in delay for various traffic conditions.",

The main challenge in this subject is to establish a suitable indicator system. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to construct an indicator system to evaluate the development of a land-sea coordination system. We take Lianyungang port as a case study. A land-sea coordination system is considered as composed by three sub-systems, i.e., a land-side sub-system, a sea-side sub-system, and a port sub-system. Based on analysis of influential factors using questionnaires for the development of a land-sea coordination system, an initial indicator system is established. We apply structural equation modeling to screen the indicators from the initial indicator system. Finally, we analyze the reliability and validity of the screened indicator system. The results show that a total of 26 indicators are generated and grouped into three major categories: (1) economic development; (2) service system; (3) resources and environment, and the screened indicator system is of suitable feasibility to be applied to evaluate the development of the considered land-sea coordination system. Additionally, the results provide a scientific reference and decision-making basis for policy formulation and development evaluation of standard ports.",

        "title": "Constructing a Virtual Space for Enhancing the Classification Performance of Fuzzy Clustering",
        "abstract": "Clustering offers a general methodology and comes with a remarkably rich conceptual and algorithmic framework for data analysis and data interpretation. As one of the most representative algorithms of fuzzy clustering, fuzzy C-means (FCM) is a widely used objective function-based clustering method exploited in various applications. In this study, a virtual-based fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed to improve the classification performance coming as a result of using fuzzy clustering. This improvement is achieved by forming a virtual space based on the original data space. First, we construct a piecewise linear transformation function to modify the similarity matrix of the original data and build the so-called virtual similarity matrix (VSM). Considering the VSM, the effect of closeness becomes amplified; in other words, high similarity values (say, larger than \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b1</italic>\n which is a cutoff value of the large and small similarity in this paper) present in the original similarity matrix are made higher, whereas lower similarity levels (say, smaller than \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b1</italic>\n) are further reduced. In addition, data with high similarity (say, larger than a certain threshold value) observed in the original space will overlap (the attributes of the samples are exactly the same) significantly in the virtual space; the overlapping samples can be treated as one sample. This modification makes possible easier to identify clusters. Second, we build a relationship matrix between the original dataset and the determined similarity values and present two closed-form solutions to the problem of building the relationship matrix. Subsequently, a virtual space of the original data space is derived through the modified similarity matrix and the introduced relationship matrix. We offer a thorough analysis behind the developed clustering algorithm. The experimental results are in agreement with the underlying conceptual basis. Furthermore, the resulting classification performance is significantly improved compared with the results produced by the FCM and the kernel-based fuzzy C-means.",

        "abstract": "In order to solve the problems of high gas consumption and low battery power in hybrid electric buses, the logic threshold control strategy is optimized by the key technology research of driving conditions, control strategy, and so on. First, driving condition data of hybrid electric buses are collected and analyzed, and three typical working conditions are selected. Second, the torque distribution control strategy is investigated based on the instantaneous optimization algorithm. The objective function of the instantaneous equivalent fuel consumption is derived. The process of solving the objective function is attributed to linear programming problem of the nonlinear objective function. The SIMULINK model of instantaneous torque distribution strategy is established based on equivalent fuel consumption. On this basis, the SIMULINK model of the function which can be integrated into the vehicle control model is established. Then, considering the actual driving conditions of the bus, the vehicle control strategy model is established in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment, and the vehicle model established by the cruise software. Finally, the vehicle model is simulated under three representative working conditions. The main contribution of this paper is the optimized torque distribution control strategy to control hybrid electric bus\u2019s energy distribution and reduce emissions. The strategy can be obtained by combining the logic threshold torque distribution control strategy, along with the optimal engine torque and motor torque, which can be obtained by solving the objective function of instantaneous equivalent fuel consumption. Results show that compared with the logic threshold value torque distribution control strategy, the energy control strategy of the instantaneous optimization algorithm can further reduce gas consumption and maintain the state of charge value balance of the power battery.",

        "abstract": "A mixed-model two-sided assembly line is a manufacturing system designed for the production of large-sized products. In order to describe the actual condition, this paper presents a novel multiobjective programming model for balancing a mixed-model two-sided assembly line subject to multiple constraints, in which, additional constraints including zoning, synchronous, and positional constraints are considered besides the traditional constraints, e.g., the precedence constraint. Two objectives are simultaneously to be optimized, one is to minimize the combination of the weighted line efficiency and the weighted smoothness index, and the other is to minimize the weighted total relevant costs per unit of a product. A novel multiobjective hybrid imperialist competitive algorithm (MOHICA) is proposed to solve this problem. In the presented MOHICA, the sigma method is employed to quantify every individual, a novel merging method is introduced to reserve better individuals into the evolutionary population, and late acceptance hill-climbing (LAHC) algorithm is presented as a local search algorithm to achieve accurate balance between intensification and diversification. The experimental results on the selected benchmark instances and a practical case show that the proposed multiobjective algorithm outperforms nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II, multiobjective improved teaching-learning-based optimization, and NSGA-III existing in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   While the concept of remanufacturing is gaining popularity in practice, its effect on environmental protection and energy saving is significant, which has attracted widespread concerns, especially in the automotive components field. Automotive components remanufacturing (ACR), as a prominent part in automotive life-cycle development, can dramatically reduce resources-waste and mitigate energy-crisis, which has become a prominent direction to promote sustainable development of Chinese economy. Thus, influence factors analysis and enterprise operation patterns assessment which primarily contribute to ACR industry development are of paramount importance. This paper elaborates the criteria influencing the ACR industry operation and analyzes the main operation patterns for ACR in China. To overcome the uncertainty of the evaluation process, a new hybrid multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) model that combines fuzzy AHP (analytical hierarchy process) and fuzzy G-TOPSIS (combining gray relation analysis and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) is proposed to determine weights of influence criteria and evaluate ACR production operation patterns. In addition, sensitivity analysis is applied to monitor the robustness of the method. The study refers to the experience of Chinese end-of-life vehicle (ELV) laws and implementation requirements of extended producer responsibility (EPR). The obtained results provide the new guideline to revise the regulations of Chinese ACR industry.",

        "abstract": "With the successful application of the electric variable transmission hybrid system, the dynamic quality of electric variable transmission (EVT) has received significant attention. The dual motor integrated by the EVT plays a vital role in riding comfort during mode shifting. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the coordinated control algorithm of the dual motor for improving driving comfort. However, current research on single motor torque compensation indicates that the poor accuracy of the compensation torque affects the coordinated control performance. In this paper, a dual motor coordinated control algorithm for the EVT is presented to solve the problem of shock in the mode transition, which is from the electric starting mode to the engine starting mode. First, the lever analogy is used to analyze the cause of the shock during this mode shifting. Then, the coordinated control algorithm of the dual motor is designed, in which the first motor MG1 adopts compounded feedforward and feedback control and the second motor MG2 adopts the torque compensation based on the engine torque estimation algorithm. Finally, the EVT system model and its dynamic coordination control algorithm model are built in the Simulink environment. The simulation results demonstrate that the presented control algorithm markedly reduces the shock of the mode shifting process. When applied in an actual driving cycle, the coordinated control algorithm proposed in this paper performs well, thus improving the dynamic quality of the EVT system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As the number of scrap cars increases rapidly, the management of their reverse logistics (RL) process has become an urgent issue for decision-makers in contemporary China. The process, capable of generating profits as well as minimizing negative environmental effects, mainly includes products acquisition, collection, inspection and disposition. Although the selection of take-back patterns is an essential part in the process, it is not well addressed by existing studies. Involving numerous related factors, the evaluation and selection of the take-back patterns of scrap cars are a comprehensive problem that can be formulated as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In this paper, we propose a complete method to solve it systematically. Three patterns quite suitable for China are presented and a novel criteria system is developed for choosing the best one. The unavoidable uncertainty in practical situation is also considered in this work. We integrate the grey method and Decision-making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory (grey DEMATEL) to determine the weights of nine criteria, and a fuzzy method and Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (fuzzy VIKOR) are adopted to rank the three patterns based on expert evaluations. Sensitivity analysis is also used to test and verify the robustness of the proposed method. Finally, we draw a conclusion that the Producer Responsibility Organization Take-back pattern whose main body is formed by manufacturer union organization is most suitable for China. The study results could provide a theoretical guideline for decision-makers in China as well as other developing countries.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a special type of nonlinear marking specifications called stair generalized mutual exclusion constraints (stair-GMECs) is defined. A stair-GMEC can be represented by an inequality whose left-hand is a linear combination of floor functions. Stair-GMECs have higher modeling power than classical GMECs and can model legal marking sets that cannot be defined by OR-AND GMECs. We propose two algorithms to enforce a stair-GMEC as a closed-loop net, in which the control structure is composed by a residue counter, remainder counters, and duplicate transitions. We also show that the proposed control structure is maximally permissive since it prevents all and only the illegal trajectories of a plant net. This approach can be applied to both bounded and unbounded nets. Several examples are proposed to illustrate the approach.",

        "abstract": "Most existing deadlock prevention studies on flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) resort to Petri nets (PNs) by designing controllers for them. PNs are an effective tool for analyzing and modeling the dynamic behavior of FMSs. As an important subclass of PNs, the system of simple sequential processes with resources (S 3 PR) can be used to model many FMSs. This paper proposes a novel resource configuration method based on structural analysis to ensure the liveness of an S 3 PR. The restrictive relation between the initial marking of the process idle places and a special PN structure called strongly connected characteristic resource sunnets (SCCRSs) is first explored by employing the corresponding relation between SCCRSs and their related strict minimal siphons. With the structural properties of SCCRSs, functions invoked to compute the configuration marking for the resource places in an SCCRS are established. Then, an algorithm for computing a configuration marking in an S 3 PR is developed, and a resource configuration tree is correspondingly generated according to the execution of the developed algorithm. Thus, the liveness of the configured system is ensured, while the siphon enumerations are avoided. It is shown that the computational complexity of the developed algorithm is polynomial, which is more efficient than other existing ones. Examples are finally provided to illustrate the mentioned results.",

        "abstract": "An auction is a crucial resource allocation mechanism for a supply chain and includes the purchasing price at the winner\u2019s bid value, eligible suppliers in winning bidder sets, and business payment terms. A multi-object auction usually involves two types of mechanisms: sequential and combinatorial auctions (CAs). A literature review reveals that the research on CAs still has some treasures waiting to be discovered. Using the framework of Petri nets, this paper employs timed and colored tokens representing every bidder\u2019s bidding data and applies transition nodes to execute bidding rules such as combinatorial discriminate analysis, bidder\u2019s bid decision-making, and the auctioneer\u2019s winner decision-making. Based on the contribution of workflows in Petri net theory, we present a case-based CA Petri net model and a sequential auction Petri net model. We compare the supply chain coordination performance of these two types of auctions and reach the conclusion under given assumptions. This paper is an attempt to apply Petri net theory to auctions and provides valuable insights for organizers to establish scientific and efficient bidding processes.",

A place called global sink/source place (GP) is introduced provisionally help us to decide a set of monitors such that deadlock states can be removed. The TGAL method proceeds with liveness enforcement by an iterative way in which a complete state enumeration is computed at each step. The resulting LES is generally maximally permissive or suboptimal, without solving intractable integer linear programming (ILP) problems. Given a system, a sufficient condition is developed to decide whether the TGAL method can find maximally permissive, that is, optimal supervisors. Several typical FMSs popularly studied in the literature are used as the examples to demonstrate the proposed method.",

Many researchers are working to overcome this problem, and a lot of methods have been developed to tackle the deadlock in FMSs. However, most of the methods in the literature provide a complex supervisory structure. This paper propose a new method of deadlock prevention for a flexible manufacturing system with a minimal supervisory structure, in which a new algorithm is developed to compute generalize mutual exclusion constrains (GMECs) for each process of the Petri net model of an FMS. The number of GMECs depends on the concurrent processes of the Petri net model. Control places are designed from the computed GMECs to enforce liveness of the Petri net model. The addition of control places to the uncontrolled Petri net provides a live controlled Petri net system with optimal control purposes.",

An RWSN is a set of networked nodes that execute reconfigurable software tasks for the control of local sensors. We propose a new design methodology named RWiN of an RWSN using unified modeling language (UML) to analyze, construct, develop, and verify easily RWSN architectures. For that, we formulate a metamodel of RWSN based on UML to describe a zone-based architecture that uses a communication protocol for the optimization of distributed reconfigurations. To control the design complexity, we model each agent of this architecture by nested state machines. To verify the temporal constraints by communicating agents, each one is modeled by a timed automaton. The paper's contribution is applied to a case study, which is simulated with TRMSim-WSN and UPPAAL environment to expose the originality of this new architecture.",

        "abstract": "This paper is dealing with the reconfiguration of a flexible real-time Network-on-Chip (NoC) in Multiprocessors System-on-Chip MPSoC architectures. We assume that each NoC\u2019s node is composed of a processor and a router. A processor is assumed to be composed of dependent periodic and aperiodic operating system tasks. The paper addresses low-power adaptations of MPSoC when dynamic reconfigurations of the periodic and aperiodic tasks (sharing resources) are applied at run-time to save or improve the performance. The reconfiguration is defined as any operation allowing the addition-removal-update of periodic dependent OS (Operating System) tasks that share resources. For two added dependent tasks assigned to different processors, a message is added automatically on the NoC. After a such scenario, several real-time constraints may be violated and the power consumption increased.In order to resolve this problem, a new approach CRMPSoC (Abbrev. Cynapsys-Reconfigurable MPSoC) that is composed of two steps is proposed: (1) Applying a reconfiguration: Selection of reconfiguration scenarios, and (2) System Feasibility: A multi-agent architecture based on a master/slave model is defined where a slave agent is assigned to each node to verify the system/bus feasibility, and a master is proposed for the whole architecture if any perturbation occurs at run-time by proposing software or hardware solutions. Since the kernel is not reconfigurable, we develop a new middleware that will support the different steps of our approach. The latter is applied to a real case study for the evaluation of the paper\u2019s contribution.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the dynamic reconfiguration of networked devices linked by a controller area network (CAN). Each device runs dependent periodic and aperiodic software tasks and can be adapted to any evolution in its environment. A reconfiguration is a dynamic scenario that activates\u2013deactivates the deployed devices, adds\u2013removes software tasks, or changes the network traffic according to user requirements. Nevertheless, such a scenario can trigger the execution of new\u2013old tasks to violate real-time deadlines or to possibly increase the energy consumption. Moreover, a reconfiguration that adapts dependent tasks in different devices can modify the network traffic and some deadlines of frames can be violated too. To resolve all these problems that can happen after concurrent distributed reconfiguration scenarios, we propose a dynamic methodology called Cynapsys-reconfigurable control system that allows coherent distributed behaviors of devices after any scenario. This run-time automatic strategy based on a multi-agent architecture is achieved in five steps: 1) applying reconfiguration scenarios on the system devices to update their services; 2) coordination between devices after any reconfiguration for their coherence; 3) feasibility analysis of each reconfigured device; 4) verification of CAN feasibility; and 5) reconfigurable frame packing. A developed tool is applied to a case study for the evaluation of the proposed contribution.",

        "title": "Designing Efficient Reconfigurable Control Systems Using IEC61499 and Symbolic Model Checking",
        "abstract": "IEC 61499 provides a standardized approach for the development of distributed control systems. The standard introduces a component architecture, based on function blocks that are event-triggered components processing data and signals. However, it gives only limited support for the design of reconfigurable architectures. In particular, handling of several reconfiguration scenarios is quite heavy on this level since a scenario changes the execution model of the system due to requirements. To this end, a new IEC 61499-based model named reconfigurable function blocks (RFBs) is proposed. An RFB processes the reconfiguration events and switches directly to the suitable configuration using a hierarchical state machine model. The latter represents the reconfiguration model which reacts on changes in the environment in order to find an adequate reconfiguration scenario to be executed. Each scenario presents a particular sequence of algorithms, encapsulated in another execution control chart slave which represents the control model of an RFB. This hierarchy simplifies the design and separates the reconfiguration logic from control models. To verify its correctness and alleviate its state space explosion problem in model checking, this paper translates an RFB system automatically into a generalized model of reconfigurable timed net condition/event systems (GR-TNCES), a Petri net class that preserves the semantics of an RFB system. In this paper, along with verification of deterministic properties, we also propose to quantify and analyze some probabilistic properties. As a case study, we consider a smart-grid system, interpreting permanent faults in it as reconfiguration events, and we characterize them with the expected occurrence probability and the corresponding repair time. A tool chain ZiZo is developed to support the proposed approach. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Note to Practitioners</italic>\n\u2014For reconfigurable distributed control systems, two models are indispensable: a control model that defines the hardware and software behaviors and a reconfiguration model that manages unpredictable changes in the related environment for configuring accordingly the system behavior. The proposed RFB approach is based on hierarchical state chart specification within function blocks, its automatic conversion to a reconfigurable Petri net GR-TNCES, which models all possible reconfiguration scenarios and a probabilistic model checking for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The system flexibility is ensured by a decision algorithm and a reconfiguration matrix which selects dynamically the right scenario to execute. The approach is supported by ZiZo tool chain which creates and edits reconfigurable function blocks model and converts it automatically to GR-TNCES, and then to specific PRISM models. The detection of the worst cases before deployment is a major virtue of the approach that practitioners need to estimate and enhance the design process. Several properties are easily checked and estimated such as system feasibility before and after reconfiguration, deadlock detection, confluence, estimation of the reconfiguration failure, system availability, and best repair time. The developed software package can be applied in any domain requiring flexibility and failure estimation, such as new medical technologies, transportation systems, smart and microgirds, and manufacturing systems.",

However, microgrids in isolated mode are susceptible to unplanned meteorological changes. The defy is to improve the autonomy of these microgrids; thus we start first by checking the required availability of power in the microgrid after unexpected hardware conflicts, characterizing the faults in production sources by probabilistic distributions and modeling their occurrences by using a connection of Markov chains and Petri nets. We propose also a new multi-agent control strategy where agents are employed to check the availability of sources and supply power automatically to consumers in accordance with their priorities and power requirements. The whole architecture is modeled by a modeling and verification environment named ZIZO. The simulation and experimental results are based on data collected from a Tunisian petroleum platform. The availability of energy in the microgrid is increased to 99.68%, and it could be corrected up to 100%. Although this strategy can decrease the availability rate for the uncritical loads, it prevents the microgrid from any dangerous situation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the area of time series representation, the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) method has established itself quite visibly resulting in a number of useful results. However, the PAA technique usually leads to some losses of information. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a representation approach called Piecewise Aggregate Pattern Representations (PAPR). In the PAPR method, the range of values assumed in the temporal segment is divided into several regions with equal probability. In the sequel, some statistics of the regions, such as the number, the mean and the variance of points falling within each region, are determined. A matrix (pattern) containing all these statistical characteristics is constructed to represent the corresponding segment of the time series. We incorporate the PAPR method into anomaly detection by computing the similarity of patterns and using a Random Walk (RW) model, as a classifier, to determine the similarity values. Finally, the connectivity and anomaly ranks of patterns are obtained with the use of the RW model. The overall anomaly detection approach is referred to as PAPR-RW. Experimental studies are reported for synthetic data sets and two publicly available data sets: electrocardiograms (ECGs) data and the video surveillance data. Compared with the PAA-based method, the PAPR-RW approach exhibits a higher level of robustness and detects anomalies more accurately.",

        "abstract": "Information granules are generic building blocks supporting the processing realized in granular computing and facilitating communication with the environment. In this paper, we are concerned with a fundamental problem of encoding\u2013decoding of information granules. The essence of the problem is outlined as follows: given a finite collection of granular data  X  1 ,  X  2 ,\u2026, X N    (sets, fuzzy sets, etc.), construct an optimal codebook composed of information granules  A  1  ,  A 2  , \u2026,  A c  , where typically  c    N,  so that any  X k   represented in terms of  A  i  u0027s and then decoded (reconstructed) with the help of this codebook leads to the lowest decoding error. A fundamental result is established, which states that in the proposed encoders and decoders, when encoding\u2013decoding error is present, the information granule coming as a result of decoding is of a higher type than the original information granules (say, if  X k   is information granule of type-1, then its decoded version becomes information granule of type-2). It would be beneficial to note that as the encoding\u2013decoding process is not lossless (in general, with an exception of a few special cases), the lossy nature of the method is emphasized by the emergence of information granules of higher type (in comparison with the original data being processed). For instance, when realizing encoding\u2013decoding of numeric data (viz., information granules of type-0), the losses occur and they are quantified in terms of intervals, fuzzy sets, probabilities, rough sets, etc., where, in fact, the result becomes an information granule of type-1. In light of the nature of the constructed result when  X k   is an interval or a fuzzy set, an optimized performance index engages a distance between the bounds of the interval-valued membership function. We develop decoding and encoding mechanisms by engaging the theory of possibility and fuzzy relational calculus and show that the decoded information granule is either a granular interval or interval-valued fuzzy set. The optimization mechanism is realized with the aid of the particle swarm optimization (PSO). A series of experiments are reported with intent to illustrate the details of the encoding\u2013decoding mechanisms and show that the PSO algorithm can efficiently optimize the granular codebook.",

In recent years, various models that describe the system from different perspectives have been built to resolve the growing challenges brought on by real-world systems. These models usually aim to achieve the highest accuracy at the cost of model interpretability. To improve the interpretability of models, a concept of granular models has been developed in the setting of granular computing. We focus on the formation of a general granular model at the higher level of hierarchy by taking advantage of existing models developed at the lower (numeric) level. Here, information granularity is regarded as an important design asset whose optimal allocation across the parameters of the original model gives rise to granular models. Next, through an allocation of information granularity to the existing type-1 granular model, we create an interesting and useful augmentation of the granular fuzzy model by forming a granular fuzzy model of type-2. Higher type granular models are also realized through the optimal allocation of information granularity. We examine the problem of outlier detection in granular models where outliers are expressed with regard to the constructed information granules. Experimental results demonstrate that granular fuzzy models provide significant improvement to the modelu0027s interpretability, and the proposed outlier detection method based on granular models of higher type is effective.",

        "abstract": "Fuzzy clustering has emerged as one of the fundamental conceptual and algorithmic frameworks supporting the development of information granules. Generic fuzzy clustering such as fuzzy C-means (FCM) has been utilized in a broad range of applications. However, the constructs resulting from fuzzy clustering, namely a partition matrix and prototypes, are numeric and as such are not capable of fully capturing the essence of the overall data. In this study, we propose an alternative augmented way of building information granules by generating hypercube-like information granules. A collection of hypercubes is referred to as a family of\u00a0 \u03f5 -information granules. This family is constructed around numeric prototypes generated through a modified version of the FCM algorithm whose running time is linear with respect to the number of clusters. By admitting a certain level of information granularity   $(varepsilon)$  , a collection of hypercubes is formed around the prototypes. The quality of information granules realized in this way is assessed by involving them in the granulation\u2014degranulation process as well as determining a value of the coverage criterion. The level of information granularity and the number of the granular prototypes in the family of    $varepsilon $  -information granules form an important design asset directly impacting the obtained coverage level of the data. The computational facet of the approach is stressed. It has been demonstrated that the granular enhancements of the description of data come with a very limited computing overhead. Experimental studies involve synthetic data as well as data coming from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The granular reconstruction capabilities delivered by the family of    $varepsilon $  -information granules are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This research paper deals with combining semi-formal and formal methods to develop distributed reconfigurable control systems. The reconfiguration consists in modifying the system behavior to adapt it to the changes in its related environment caused by user needs and operating constraints. A DRCS which consists of networked reconfigurable control systems (RCSs), is a set of functional operations such that only a subset is executed by adding or removing operations after a well-defined reconfiguration scenario. To dynamically handle reconfiguration scenarios at run-time, a defined multi-agent architecture is proposed and affects a reconfiguration agent (RA) for the local reconfiguration of each RCS and a global coordination agent to harmonize the different RCSs for a required coherence. To provide a documented and safe reconfigurable system, we propose a new methodology called DRec-UML-B that covers all software development phases from modeling and verification to code generation using UML and B. The DRec-UML-B development process consists of two complementary phases: UML specification and B specification. In the first phase, we model the different agents with UML to specify the static and dynamic aspects of the DRCS. The second phase translates the UML specification to obtain the B abstract model using defined DRec-rules and reduces the number of operations to be transformed from a UML class diagram to B ones. Then, we apply successive refinements to obtain the C code and we check the system using Atelier B and  Check R-B  tools for the consistency and accuracy of the specification, refinement, and code generation levels to avoid the redundant control of B machines that share similar sequences of operations. We apply all the proposed contributions to two benchmark production systems FESTO and EnAS to discuss the benefits of DRec-UML-B methodology in terms of the number of generated B operations.",

In this method, the set of unobservable transitions are partitioned into pseudo-observable and strictly unobservable ones, and the subnet induced by the latter is acyclic. The unobservable reach of a marking can be characterized by the union of the strictly unobservable reach of several basis markings, called representative markings, in the unobservable subnet. The set of consistent markings can be characterized by a linear algebraic system based on those representative markings. Based on the representative marking graph, the current marking estimation problem for a labelled Petri net can be efficiently solved. This method does not require the assumption that the unobservable subnet is acyclic.",

        "title": "Marking Estimation in a Class of Time Labeled Petri Nets",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes an efficient marking estimation method for a subclass of \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">time labeled Petri nets</italic>\n (TLPNs), in which each transition is associated with an infinite upper bound delay. The unobservable subnet of the considered subclass of TLPNs is backward-conflict-free, and all the output transitions of each conflict place are observable. The highlight of this method is that the markings set consistent with a given observation can be determined by a linear algebraic system based on the so-called \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">slow-bound</italic>\n marking and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">fast-bound marking</italic>\n pairs. An algorithm to compute an online estimator is provided, and an example is given. By this method, the exhaustive construction of the full state space including the state class graph is avoided. This approach provides guidelines of sensor deployment in the design stage so that the online marking estimation problem can be efficiently solved.",

        "abstract": "Timed marked graphs, a special class of Petri nets, are extensively used to model and analyze cyclic manufacturing systems. Weighted marked graphs are convenient to model systems with bulk services and arrivals. We consider two problems of practical importance for this class of nets. The marking optimization problem consists in finding an initial marking to minimize the weighted sum of tokens in places, while the average cycle time is less than or equal to a given value. The cycle time optimization problem consists in finding an initial marking to minimize the average cycle time, while the weighted sum of tokens in places is less than or equal to a given value. We propose two heuristic algorithms to solve these problems. Several simulation studies show that the proposed approach is significantly more efficient than existing ones.",

We consider a special subclass of generalized Petri nets called weighted state machines (WSMs) that have state-machine topology with weighted arcs.

We propose a dynamic programming method to compute the admissible marking set of an elementary GMEC for a net in this subclass.

The analyzed flexible manufacturing cell consists of one or more machine(s), a single conveyor, and a single robot. The conveyor transfers similar workpieces to the robot areas. Then, the robot loads parts onto the machines, which perform similar machining processes. The machines are subject to failure after a certain time due to tool wear or resetting. When a machine is in failure, a repair action is taken by the flexible manufacturing cell operator. A generalized stochastic Petri net model is constructed for a single-machine and three-machine flexible manufacturing cells, after which the suggested generalized stochastic Petri net model can be generalized to a flexible manufacturing cell with n machines. The obtained results provide an estimate of machine, robot, and operator utilization and production rates for the considered flexible manufacturing cell. Sensit...",

        "abstract": "In a cluster tool, periodical maintenance and lot switching operations require that the tool should be emptied from time to time. Thus, it is very important to optimize a normal close-down process from the steady state to the idle state. Besides, process modules (PMs) are prone to failure. When a PM at a step without any other parallel PMs fails, the tool cannot complete the entire process of any new wafer and some already in the tool. We need to close down the tool to empty it as well. Optimal scheduling of a close-down process is important yet challenging. Wafer residency time constraints make it even more challenging. By assuming no parallel PM at a step, this work focuses on time-constrained single-arm cluster tools in order to optimize their close-down process with and without PM failure. It first develops a linear program to optimize a normal close-down process. It then presents PM failure control rules to deal with the wafer in a failed PM and develops one more linear program to find an optimal schedule for the close-down process with PM failure. This work finally gives a real industrial case to show the new research results.",

Due to their modular property and non-interleaving semantics, NCESs are applied in modeling, analysis, and control of dynamic reconfigurable discrete event systems in recent years. A system reconfiguration should be finished before the maximum permissible reconfiguration delay. Therefore, to compute a shortest legal firing sequence (SLFS) from the state where a reconfiguration requirement arises to a target state which is proper for implementing the required reconfiguration is necessary. This paper combines the optimality principle and integer linear programming (ILP) techniques to find an SLFS in NCESs under the firing rule \u2018arbitrary maximal stepsu0027, where both event processing modes \u2018AND\u2019 and \u2018OR\u2019 of transitions are considered. An SLFS can be computed in a single ILP step. The amount of variables and constraints is polynomial with the size of the underlying NCES and the maximum permissible reconfiguration delay.

The design process is formulated as an optimization problem. First, a series of numeric prototypes are determined around which information granules are constructed. Second, the values of radii of these information granules are optimized aiming at maximizing a certain performance index. Two alternatives of determining centers of information granules are compared, i.e., randomly selected numeric prototypes and prototypes generated with the aid of clustering.

Data imputation is a common practice encountered when dealing with incomplete data. Irrespectively of the existing spectrum of techniques, the results of imputation are commonly numeric meaning that once the data have been imputed they are not distinguishable from the original data being initially available prior to imputation. In this study, the crux of the proposed approach is to develop a way of representing imputed (missing) entries as information granules and in this manner quantify the quality of the imputation process and the quality of the ensuing data. We establish a two-stage imputation mechanism in which we start with any method of numeric imputation and then form a granular representative of missing value. In this sense, the approach could be regarded as an enhancement of the existing imputation techniques.Proceeding with the detailed imputation schemes, we discuss two ways of imputation. In the first one, imputation is realized for individual variables of data sets and afterwards enhanced by the buildup of information granules. In the second approach, we are concerned with the use of fuzzy clustering, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), which helps establish a structure in the data and then use this information in the imputation process.The design of information granules invokes the fundamentals of Granular Computing, namely a principle of justifiable granularity and an allocation of information granularity. Numeric experiments concerned with a suite of publicly available data sets offer detailed insights into the main facets of the overall design process and deliver a parametric analysis of the methods.",

Among various fuzzy models, Takagi\u2013Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models form one of the intensively studied and applied categories of models. In this study, we are concerned with a development of a granular TS fuzzy model realized on a basis of numerical evidence and completed through a combination of fuzzy subspace clustering and the principle of optimal allocation of information granularity. The TS fuzzy models are built with the use of the fuzzy subspace clustering algorithm. Information granularity is regarded as a crucial design asset whose optimal allocation gives rise to  granular  fuzzy models and makes the constructed models to become better in rapport with experimental data. In comparison with fuzzy models, granular fuzzy models produce results (outputs) that are information granules rather than numeric entities being encountered in fuzzy models. In contrast with the commonly used optimization criteria, which emphasize the highest accuracy encountered at the numeric level, the performance of the granular TS fuzzy model is quantified in terms of the coverage and specificity criteria where such criteria are of interest in the evaluation of quality of information granules vis-a-vis experimental (numeric) data.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we elaborate on a new design approach to the development and analysis of granular input spaces and ensuing granular modeling. Given a numeric model (no matter what specific design methodology has been used to construct it and what architecture has been adopted), we form a granular input space through allocating a certain level of information granularity across the input variables. The formation of granular input space helps us gain a better insight into the ranking of input variables with respect to their precision (the variables with a lower level of information granularity need to be specified in a precise way when estimating the inputs). As a consequence, for granular inputs, the outputs of the granular model are also information granules (say, intervals, fuzzy sets, rough sets, etc.). It is shown that the process of forming granular input space can be sought as an optimization of allocation of information granularity across the input variables so that the specificity of the corresponding granular outputs of the granular model becomes the highest while coverage of data becomes maximized. The construction of granular input space dwells upon two fundamental principles of granular computing--the principle of justifiable granularity and the optimal allocation of information granularity. The quality of the granular input space is quantified in terms of the two conflicting criteria, that is, the specificity of the results produced by the granular model and the coverage of experimental data delivered by this model. In the ensuing optimization problem, one maximizes a product of specificity and coverage. Differential evolution is engaged in this optimization task. The experimental studies involve both synthetic dataset and data coming from the machine learning repository.",

We first present a new fast binary descriptor with a double circle structure of overlapping regions, namely double circle structure descriptor (DCSD). DCSD is rotation invariant and robust against blur, illumination changes, Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) compression and orientation changes. Experimental results show that with fewer feature bits, DCSD is still discriminative and faster than the state-of-the-art features in many general situations. We then propose a new matching measure named Hough Voting Matching (HVM), which is based on clustering and Hough voting schemes. HVM can efficiently discriminate between correct and incorrect keypoint correspondences, and can be combined with some descriptors to improve the matching accuracy as an independent part. Experiments are also presented to illustrate that HVM can refine the matching results of DCSD if we embed HVM into a DCSD algorithm.",

        "abstract": "PurposeDeadlock is a rather undesirable phenomenon and must be well solved in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). This paper aims to propose a general iterative deadlock control method for a class of generalized Petri nets (GPN), namely, G-systems, which can model an FMS with assembly and disassembly operations of multiple resource acquisition. When given an uncontrolled G-system prone to deadlocks, the work focuses on the synthesis of a near-optimal, non-blocking supervisor based on reachability graph (RG) analysis.Design/methodology/approachThe concept of a global idle place (GIP) for an original uncontrolled G-system is presented. To simplify the RG computation of an uncontrolled G-system, a GIP is added temporarily to the net model during monitor computation steps. Starting with one token and then by gradually increasing the number of tokens in the GIP at each iteration step, the related net system is obtained. The minimal-covered-set of all bad markings of the related net system suffering from deadlock can be identified and then removed by additional monitors through an established place-invariant control method. Consequently, all related systems are live, and the GIP is finally removed when the non-blockingness of the controlled system is achieved. Meanwhile, the redundancy of monitors is also checked.FindingsA typical G-system example is provided to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that the proposed method is easy to use and provides very high behavioral permissiveness for G-system. Generally, it can achieve an optimal or a near-optimal solution of the non-blocking supervisor.Originality/valueIn this work, the concept of GIP for G-systems is presented for synthesis non-blocking supervisors based on RG analysis. By using GIP, an effective deadlock control method is proposed. Generally, the proposed method can achieve an optimal or a near-optimal, non-blocking supervisor for an uncontrolled G-system prone to deadlocks.",

        "abstract": "Generalized mutual exclusion constraints (GMECs) are a typical class of specifications for the supervisory control of discrete event systems in a Petri net formalism. This paper classifies the given constraints into elementary and dependent ones according to the linear dependency of their characteristic transition vectors that indicate the token count change of the concerned places. The dependent constraints are further divided into strongly and weakly dependent ones. A constraint is usually enforced by explicitly adding a monitor to a plant model. This research develops the conditions under which a dependent constraint is enforced due to the enforcement of the elementary constraints. The results developed in this paper are applied to the existing manufacturing-oriented Petri net classes. An algorithm is also proposed to identify a set of elementary constraints.

A classic social network only reflects how closely related any two resource individuals are. Some resources may play similar roles in the network, and they can establish their own resource community. The algorithm reported in this paper constructs a resource community net with optimal modularity. Moreover, we find that there are some resources playing multiple roles in different communities, taking on different responsibilities in a system. Another algorithm is developed to discover these multi-role resources, and a corresponding resource role network is built. Finally, two examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed approach.",

In this paper, a novel vector covering approach is developed to reduce the computational cost of designing maximally permissive supervisors for flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs), by reducing the number of operation places and legal markings (LMs) that need to be considered. A vector covering approach is used to find the minimal covered set of first-met bad markings (FBMs). Then, a novel vector covering approach is proposed to reduce the set of LMs to a smaller covering set. The proposed method can reduce the number of both variables and constraints in the integer linear programming problems (ILPPs).

        "abstract": "Abstract   Anomaly detection in sequence data is becoming more and more important in a wide variety of application domains such as credit card fraud detection, health care in medical field, and intrusion detection in cyber security. In the existing anomaly detection approaches, Markov chain techniques are widely accepted for their simple realization and few parameters. However, the short memory property of a classical Markov model ignores the interaction among data, and the long memory property of a higher order Markov model clouds the relationship between the previous data and current test data, and reduces the reliability of the model. Besides, both of these models cannot successfully describe the sequences changing with a tendency. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on a dynamic Markov model. This approach segments sequence data by a sliding window. In the sliding window, we define the states of data according to the value of the data and establish a higher order Markov model with a proper order consequently, to balance the length of the memory property and keep up with the trend of sequences. In addition, an anomaly substitution strategy is proposed to prevent the detected anomalies from impacting the building of the models and keep anomaly detection continuously. The experimental results using simulated datasets and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the proposed approach improves the adaptability and stability of anomaly detection in sequence data.",

For DESs with uncontrollable events, linear constraint transformation becomes a popular technique for solving the forbidden state problem when Petri nets are used as a modeling tool and control specifications are given in the form of linear constraints. This paper proposes a novel linear constraint transformation approach that is applicable to PT-ordinary Petri nets with uncontrollable subnets being forward-concurrent-free. For such nets, a linear constraint can be transformed into an optimal transformed one (i.e., a linear constraint that exactly characterizes the admissible marking set) by using the proposed approach, which is computationally shown to be of polynomial complexity with respect to the net size. An example is presented to illustrate the developed technique.",

        "abstract": "A fair amount of research has shown the importance of siphons in the analysis and control of deadlocks in a variety of resource allocation systems by using a Petri net formalism. In this paper, siphons in a generalized Petri net are classified into elementary and dependent ones, as done for ordinary nets in our previous work. Conditions are derived under which a dependent siphon is controlled by properly supervising its elementary siphons, which indicates that the controllability of dependent siphons in an ordinary Petri net is a special case of that in a generalized one. The application of the controllability of dependent siphons is shown by considering the deadlock prevention problem for a class of resource allocation systems, namely, G-system that allows multiple resource acquisitions and flexible routings in a flexible manufacturing system with machining, assembly, and disassembly operations. We develop a monitor-based deadlock prevention policy that first adds monitors for elementary siphons only to a G-system plant model such that the resultant net system satisfies the maximal controlled-siphon property (maximal cs-property). Then, by linear programming, initial tokens in the additional monitors are decided such that liveness is enforced to the supervised system. Also, a simplified live marking relationship for a G-system between the initial tokens of the source places and those of the resource places is derived. Finally, the proposed deadlock prevention methods are illustrated by using an example.",

        "abstract": "As a methodology of resource location and allocation, reverse auctions are one of the most important activities in supply chains. There are four main auction mechanisms in auction theory, ascending-bid auctions, descending-bid auctions, first-price and sealed-bid auctions, and second-price and sealed-bid auctions. Recently, procurement bidding auctions have been widely studied in the aspects of bidding strategy, auction mechanism with different characteristics, behavior and psychology, collusion and its detection method, and the risk management. However, studies addressing the issue of which is the better reverse auction mechanism in cost-down performance are rarely documented. In this work, simulations are performed to study the integrated process of a dynamic online reverse auction and a static sealed-bid reverse auction using timed colored Petri nets based on the contribution of event management and workflow in Petri net theory. In the Petri net models, colored tokens represent bidders\u2019 related data in...",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the enforcement of generalized mutual exclusion constraints (GMECs) on time Petri nets (TPNs) with uncontrollable transitions by restricting the firing intervals of controllable transitions. Existing approaches do not exploit the timing information and consequently the system permissiveness is limited. The key idea behind the proposed approach is the online computation of a graph representing a reduced portion of the state space of a TPN system, and precisely the states that can be reached from the current one by firing only uncontrollable transitions. Such a graph is called partial modified state class graph (PMSCG) and is derived from another graph recently presented in the literature. Based on the PMSCG, a procedure to compute a supervisory control law enforcing a GMEC on a TPN system in a maximally permissive way is presented.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm is a widely used objective function-based clustering method exploited in numerous applications. In order to improve the quality of clustering algorithms, this study develops a novel approach, in which a transformed data-based FCM is developed. Two data transformation methods are proposed, using which the original data are projected in a nonlinear fashion onto a new space of the same dimensionality as the original one. Next, clustering is carried out on the transformed data. Two optimization criteria, namely a classification error and a reconstruction error, are introduced and utilized to guide the optimization of the performance of the new clustering algorithm and a transformation of the original data space. Unlike other data transformation methods that require some prior knowledge, in this study, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to determine the optimal transformation realized on a basis of a certain performance index. Experimental studies completed for a synthetic data set and a number of data sets coming from the Machine Learning Repository demonstrate the performance of the FCM with transformed data. The experiments show that the proposed fuzzy clustering method achieves better performance (in terms of the clustering accuracy and the reconstruction error) in comparison with the outcomes produced by the generic version of the FCM algorithm.",

        "abstract": "\nThe Late Cenozoic evolution of the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau has been well documented, but controversies remain concerning Late Cenozoic acceleration of exhumation. We present 41 new apatite and zircon (U\u2013Th)/He ages from six transects in the Daliang Mountains that provide constraints on the timing and the rate of denudation. We calculated exhumation rates for the transects based on the age versus elevation/structural depth relationship. The results are consistent across the Daliang Mountains and indicate a protracted period of slow cooling and denudation from ~30 to ~10\u00a0Ma, with an exhumation rate of ~0.15\u00a0mm/year. This slow exhumation is followed by accelerated rates of ~0.4\u20130.8\u00a0mm/year since ~10\u00a0Ma. The protracted slow denudation and long residence time within the apatite helium partial retention zone resulted in large variations in single-grain (U\u2013Th)/He ages. We suggest that the post ~10-Ma rapid cooling and exhumation in the Daliang Mountains is driven by the eastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau. Furthermore, we suggest that the mountain building in the Daliang Mountains result from the crustal shortening accompanied with transpression, rather than from the lower crustal channel flow.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Daloushan mountain chain, located in the centre of the upper Yangtze continental block, is considered to represent the locus of the tectonic shortening resulting from the eastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau and NW-thrusting of the Xuefeng Orogen. Structural data and apatite fission-track ages have been used to decipher the geometry and the kinematic evolution of the Daloushan. The latter is subdivided into two domains: the eastern domain, governed by west- to NW-verging thrusting and deformation with dextral transpression, and a western domain, governed by south-verging thrusting and deformation. Both domains experienced four episodes of deformation, synchronous with the four stages of post-Cretaceous denudation, marked by rapid cooling propagating eastward from 20 to 5\u00a0Ma, at a rate of \u223c0.1\u00a0mm/year. In particular, the last two episodes of denudation are closely related to the growth of the Tibetan Plateau. This indicates an intra-continental transfer of tectonic forcing from the Palaeo-Pacific to the Tethys-Himalayan Tectonic Domain across the Daloushan.",

Two groups of detrital zircons, i.e. magmatic and metamorphic in origin, have been identified based on cathodoluminescence images, zircon Ti-temperatures, and Th/U ratios.

        "abstract": "The older and deeper hydrocarbon accumulations receive increasing attention across the world, providing more technical and commercial challenges to hydrocarbon exploration. We present a study of an asymmetrical, N-S striking intracratonic sag which developed across the Sichuan basin, south China, from Late Ediacaran to Early Cambrian times. The Mianyang-Changning intracratonic sag is ~50\u2009km wide, with its steepest part in the basin center. In particular the eastern margin shows its greatest steepness. Five episodes in the evolutions of the sag can be recognized. It begins in the Late Ediacaran with an uplift and erosion correlated to Tongwan movement. Initial extension occurred during the Early Cambrian Maidiping period, when more strata of the Maidiping Formation were deposited across the sag. Subsequently, maximum extension occurred during the Early Cambrian Qiongzhusi period that resulted in 450\u20131700\u2009m thick Maidiping-Canglangpu Formations being deposited in the sag. Then, the sag disappeared at the Longwangmiao period, as it was infilled by the sediments. The intracratonic sag has significant influence on the development of high-quality reservoirs in the Dengying and Longwangmiao Formations and source-rock of the Niutitang Formation. It thus indicates that a high probability for oil/gas accumulation exists along the intracratonic sag, across the central Sichuan basin.",

To gain a better understanding of the influence of burial depth on the pore system of shales and to aid in the study of nanopore characteristics, the samples were analyzed by FESEM and N2 gas adsorption. Samples of Sichuan Basin shales recovered from depths ranging from 0 to 5000 m were selected as a control group. The results show similar nanopore characteristics in all 32 superdeeply buried shale samples from the three formations. The dominant pore types in the superdeeply buried shales are organic matter pores and interparticle pores, along with minor intraparticle pores. The dominant pore morphology is slit-like in shape.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Every orogenic belt is marked by a fault system, the nature of which depends on the orogenic processes and formation mechanisms at play. The Chengkou Fault separates the Qinling Orogen from the Yangtze Block and played an important role in the formation of the arcuate Dabashan fold-and-thrust belt. Therefore, it is a very good place to improve our understanding of plate collisions and intra-continental orogenies. We collected detailed field data along the Chengkou Fault to clarify its structural features and develop a reconstruction of the Dabashan fold-and-thrust belt. Based on our study and previous studies, we believe that the Chengkou Fault experienced complex deformations, in at least three stages, before the Cenozoic. The Chengkou Fault first developed as a normal fault with some curvature on the passive continental margin of the Yangtze Block during the Early Paleozoic. NEE-directed compression related to the collision of the North China and South China plates during the Triassic resulted in the Chengkou Fault being thrust southward. With the development of curvature on the Chengkou Fault, sinistral strike-slip movement on its eastern segment and dextral strike-slip movement on its western segment gradually appeared. The fault was reactivated under a NNW-directed compressive stress field during the following intracontinental orogeny, which spanned the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. The obvious decrease in the plunge angle of the fold hinge as one moves east along the fault, as well as a few strike-slip indicators on the eastern segment of the Chengkou Fault, reveal that both reverse and dextral strike-slip components occur on the western segment, while the reverse movement progressively dominates the eastern segment. This change may be attributable to the increasing angle between the regional compressive stress and the Chengkou Fault.",

        "abstract": "The Xichang Basin in southeastern Tibet provides crucial information about formation and tectonic processes affecting the eastern Tibetan Plateau. To determine when and how the uplift developed, we conducted detailed studies of structures and obtained thermochronology data from the Xichang Basin and its periphery. The Xichang Basin is characterized by gentle deformation of the strata, segmented by an E-vergent boundary thrust fault. Two stages of deformation, strike-slip followed by an E-W oriented shortening resulted in oblique shortening between the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin. New apatite fission track data interpreted together with (U-Th)/He data confirm a simple burial/heating and exhumation/cooling history across the Xichang Basin and its periphery. Subsidence and burial of the Xichang Basin peaked between 80~30 Ma, followed by mountain building with a protracted cooling starting at around 40-20 Ma, with rates of ~2.0-8.0 \u00b0C/Myr (i.e., 0.1-0.3 mm/yr). Our data indicate that the Xichang Basin has experienced ~2.5-5 km of exhumation, much more intensive than the ~1-2 km of exhumation inferred for the southwestern Sichuan Basin. Restored balanced cross-sections of post-Late-Triassic strata along a ~250 km traverse indicate ~10-20% east-west shortening strain (i.e., ~20-30 km) at the southeastern Tibetan Plateau during Cenozoic time. Study of crustal thickening and erosion supports a tectonic shortening mechanism to account for the uplift of the Xichang Basin on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau.This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "The geographic distribution of different viruses has developed widely, giving rise to an escalating number of cases during the past two decades. The deterministic Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious (SEI) models can demonstrate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the diseases and have been used extensively in modern mathematical and mechano-biological simulations. This article presents a functional technique to model the stochastic effects and seasonal forcing in a reliable manner by satisfying the Lipschitz criteria. We have emphasized that the graphical portrayal can prove to be a powerful tool to demonstrate the stability analysis of the deterministic as well as the stochastic modeling. Emphasis is made on the dynamical effects of the force of infection. Such analysis based on the parametric sweep can prove to be helpful in predicting the disease spread in urban as well as rural areas and should be of interest to mathematical biosciences researchers.",

It involves selecting an optimal combination from a reasonable number of doctors, nurses and emergency medical technicians. Selecting suitable members for a  (MET) will facilitate the effectiveness of  (EMS). Essentially, investigations on EMS could offer models which increase the efficiency of proper matching and earn time to save lives. The existing methods for member selection pay much attention to the individual information to measure the individual performance of members, while few studies focus on the collaborative information to measure the collaborative performance between members. This paper aims to propose a two-stage method for member selection of an MET. In the first stage, knowledge rules are proposed to identify the valid candidates quickly. In the second stage, the individual information of members, the collaborative information between members, and the response time of EMS are all considered to build a three-objective 0-1 programming model. Due to its intractability, the model is solved by a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Liberia, now suffering the Ebola virus, is used as a backdrop for this study. A practical example followed by a computational simulation experiment is used to illustrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The plants to be controlled have identical structures, but reference signals for each plant are different. During control process, each agent intermittently broadcasts its neural network (NN) weight estimation to its neighboring agents under an event-triggered condition that is only based on its own estimated NN weights. If communication topology is connected and undirected, the NN weights of all neural control systems can converge to a small neighborhood of their optimal values. The generalization ability of NNs is guaranteed in the event-triggered context, that is, the approximation domain of each NN is the union of all system trajectories. Furthermore, a strictly positive lower bound on the interevent intervals is also guaranteed to avoid the Zeno behavior. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning law.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the risk factors associated with aggression in patients with schizophrenia. Methods Patient clinical, behavioural, and demographic information was collected and reported online to the Beijing Mental Health Information Management System by psychiatrists. We used chi-square tests to analyse information between 2011 and 2015 to determine the prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia and the rate of aggression. We used univariate and binary logistic regression to analyse risk factors of aggressive behaviours. Results The prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia, and the proportion of cases displaying aggressive behaviour, increased considerably from 2011 to 2015. Risk of aggression was associated with non-adherence to medication (odds ratio [OR]: 2.92; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.08-4.11), being unmarried (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.03-2.55), having physical disease (OR: 3.26; 95% CI: 2.28-4.66), and higher positive symptom scores (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.06-3.81). Physical disease was a risk factor associated with committing more than one type of aggression. Conclusion We confirmed that demographic factors, treatment-related factors, and clinical symptoms were associated with aggression in patients with schizophrenia in Beijing. A focus on improving controllable factors, including medication adherence and physical health status, might help to prevent aggressive behaviour.",
