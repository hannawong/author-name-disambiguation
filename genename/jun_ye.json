        "abstract": "A kind of Laguerre analog compound orthogonal neural network was presented and was applied to the direct adaptive control of super-heated steam temperature in a power plant. Herein, the analog neural network was developed to employ the direct adaptive controller. This single-hidden layer orthogonal neural network is based on Laguerre compound orthogonal polynomial function and has a simple learning algorithm that is derived from an on-line continuously learning, and the learning algorithm is not relative to the controlled plant model. Owing to using the three-layer network structure and no weight adjustment between the input and the hidden layer, the learning algorithm is used to search for optimum weights between only the hidden layer and the output layer. Therefore, the orthogonal neural network has fast learning speed. A node (a processing element) in the hidden layer of the network is an expansion term of the Laguerre polynomials. More or less terms determine the network learning speed and accuracy. Simulation for the super-heated steam temperature in a power plant was carried out under such a control that had a severe uncertainty of parameters and disturbance, as well as a large time-delay. The results show that the control system performance is superior to the conventional PI control system.",

Compared with grey prediction, the neural network has high prediction accuracy and can control the prediction error because the compound orthogonal neural network has a simple algorithm, high-speed convergence of learning process, and excellent characteristics in the linear or nonlinear accurate approximation. If the neural network is treated as the grey predictor to form a grey prediction control, it will get good control performances in the control systems. Therefor, traditional PID control and grey prediction compensation of a neural network are integrated together to build a grey PID controller. It obtains on-line grey prediction and control. The grey prediction model built by a compound orthogonal neural network in the undetermined parts of system can automatically adjust the compensation value of grey prediction according to changing parameters, which makes the controller adaptive to the response of systems. Simulation results show that this controller can achieve better dynamic performance and robustness than that of traditional PID control.",

In the flight simulator servo system of DC motor with nonlinear friction torque, the control system was based on the parallel control method of the PD feedback control and the feedforward control of the neural network. The affect of nonlinear friction torque was rejected by use of the neural network. The analog compound orthogonal neural network was obtained by means of a continuous algorithm treatment for a digital compound orthogonal neural network, and was used as the feedforward controller. The servo control of DC motor with nonlinear friction torque was simulated by means of the parallel control and the single PD control. The simulation results prove that the compound control has better real-time control performance, faster response velocity, and higher tracking precision than the single PD control. The position and speed tracking control obtain satisfactory effects. The analog neural controller can be applicable to the control of uncertain objects and provides a novel approach for the type of an uncertain control system.",

The relation degree is the measurement index to evaluate how the design scheme is close to the expected one (ideal scheme). The bigger the relation degree is, the better the close degree between the design scheme and the expected scheme is. Finally, the rationality of evaluation in mechanical design schemes was demonstrated through illustrations.",

Studies, however, have focused largely on cohorts consisting of Caucasian patients. In this study, uterine leiomyomas from Chinese patients were examined for MED12 mutations. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was compared with direct sequencing as a potentially more sensitive method for the detection of MED12 mutations.Tissue samples with the pathologies of uterine leiomyoma (n=181) and other endometrial diseases (n=157) were collected from Chinese patients at the Taizhou People's Hospital and Taizhou Polytechnic College (Taizhou City, China). Genomic DNA was prepared from all samples. Both PCR-based HRMA and PCR-based direct sequencing were used to detect MED12 mutations.PCR-based HRMA and direct sequencing revealed MED12 mutations in 95/181 (52.5%) and 93/181 (51.4%) uterine leiomyomas, respectively. Nearly half of these mutations (46/93) were found in a single codon, codon 131. The coincidence rate between the two methods was 98.9% (179/181) so that no statistically significant difference was evident in the application of the methodologies (\u03c7(2)=0.011, p=0.916). In addition, MED12 mutations were identified in 1/157 (4.17%) case of other endometrial pathologies by both methods.MED12 mutations were closely associated with the development of uterine leiomyomas, as opposed to other uterine pathologies in Chinese patients, and PCR-based HRMA was found to be a reliable method for the detection of MED12 mutations.",

        "abstract": "Celastrol, a plant triterpene, has anticancer effects by increase of apoptosis. In the present study, the mechanism of celastrol on gastric cancer cell apoptosis was examined.The effect of celastrol on PI3K/Akt and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway was evaluated with Western blot and luciferase reporter assay. miR-21 expression was determined using real-time PCR. miR-21 inhibitor and miR-21 mimic were used to downregulate and upregulate miR-21 expression, respectively.It was identified that celastrol was capable of inducing apoptosis of gastric cancer cells, which was mediated via inhibiting the activation of PI3K/Akt and NF-\u03baB. A strong activator of Akt, IGF-1 restored NF-\u03baB activity in cells treated with celastrol. Celastrol could also significantly suppress miR-21 expression. Furthermore, miR-21 inhibitor could decrease phospho-Akt expression and NF-\u03baB activity. Notably, upregulation of miR-21 expression can increase PI3K/Akt and NF-\u03baB activity and decrease apoptosis of gastric cancer cells treated with celastrol, which could be reversed by PI3K inhibitor.Our data revealed that the effect of celastrol on apoptosis was due to miR-21 inhibiting the PI3K/Akt-dependent NF-\u03baB pathway.",

Methods HSV-TK/GCV suicide gene system regulated by the radiation promoter Egr1 was combined with radiotherapy organically to intervene ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) assay and flow cytometry(FCM) assay were performed to examine the growth inhibition and the apoptosis of HO8910 cells, compared with that of radiotherapy alone. Optical microscope and electron microscope were used to observe cell morphological changes. Results Radiation-gene therapy has a good growth inhibition and apoptosis induction effect on ovarian cancer HO8910 cells, far better than that radiotherapy alone did. After intervened for 60 h, 72 h and 96 h, the cell proliferation inhibition ratio in the radiation-gene therapy group reached(56.88\u00b15.35)%,(69.09\u00b13.43)% and(86.91\u00b10.75)%, respectively, but that in the corresponding radiotherapy alone group was only(21.93\u00b111.37)%,(37.99\u00b17.24)% and(69.55\u00b13.26)%, respectively. After intervened for 48 h, the cell mortality rate of radiation-gene therapy group reached 26.01%(apoptosis rate: 19.45%; necrosis rate: 6.56%), significantly higher than 12.47%(apoptosis rate: 8.68%; necrosis rate: 3.79%) of the radiotherapy alone group and 4.41%(apoptosis rate: 2.52%; necrosis rate: 1.89%) of negative control group. The cells in the radiation- gene therapy group presented typical apoptosis morphological features and the cell growth condition was much worse than that in the radiotherapy alone group and that in the negative control group. Conclusion The combination application of radiation-gene has a good synergistic and complementary effect, with a stronger antitumor effect than that the single radiotherapy does.",

        "abstract": "CD4 +T cell counts are closely related to the progression of HBV infection. Here, we investigated how the proportions of three CD4 +T cell subsets - CD127 -CD25 -, CD127 +CD25 low/- and CD127 lowCD25 high - changed during HBV infection, as is little known. Compared with healthy controls, the proportions of CD127 -CD25 - in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and HBV carriers significantly increased, while that of CD127 +CD25 low/- significantly decreased. The proportion of CD127 lowCD25 high in CHB patients was significantly higher than those in HBV carriers or healthy controls. Compared with HBV-DNA negative group, the proportion of CD127 -CD25 - in positive group significantly decreased and that of CD127 +CD25 low/- significantly increased. In the follow-up study for CHB patients treated with interferon-\u03b12b for 12 weeks or 24 weeks, the proportions of CD127 -CD25 - significantly decreased, while that of CD127 low/-CD25 high significantly increased. The results suggested that specific changes in the fraction of CD4 +T cell subsets expressing CD127 and/or CD25 were associated with hepatitis B progression. \u00a9 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",

The levels of chemokines and cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The proportion of CD34+ cells in patients with cirrhosis was significantly increased compared with the healthy controls (p<0.05) and was increased obviously after treatment by G-CSF mobilization (p<0.01). The expression levels of SDF-1, SCF and MMP-9 were significantly elevated in patients with chronic hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis (p<0.01). The expression levels of SCF and MMP-9 were significantly elevated after treatment with G-CSF (p<0.05). No significant differences were found in the levels of total bilirubin, albumin and prothrombin time between the treated and control groups; furthermore, no significant differences were observed in the cure and improvement rates between the two groups.The basal levels of stem cell mobilization in patients with liver cirrhosis might be associated with the repair of liver injury. G-CSF could promote hematopoietic stem cell mobilization through regulation of the expression levels of stem-cell-mobilization-related factors in patients with liver cirrhosis. No apparent effects of G-CSF therapy on both liver function and short-term prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis were confirmed.",

        "abstract": "Artesunate (ART), derived from a common traditional Chinese medicine, has beeen used an antimalarial for several years. In this study, the effect and mechanism of ART on anti-human cervical cancer cells was examined. The level of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) and the population of CD4+CD25+Foxp3 regulatory T cells (Treg) in peripheral blood were detected by flow cytometry. In vivo antitumor activity was investigated in mice with cervical cancer by the subcutaneous injection of various concentrations of ART. The concentrations of PGE2 in the supernatants of CaSki cells were measured using an ELISA kit. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Foxp3 expression were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis. The effect of ART on the viability of CaSki and Hela cells was evaluated with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. It was identified that the level of PGE2 and the population of CD4+CD25+Foxp3 Treg cells in the peripheral blood were significantly higher in cervical cancer patients and mice with cervical cancer. ART was capable of inhibiting orthotopic tumor growth, which correlated with a decrease in the level of PGE2 and the percentage of Treg cells in mice with cervical cancer. Furthermore, ART decreased COX-2 expression and the production of PGE2 in CaSki and Hela cells. Notably, the supernatants of CaSki cells treated with ART lowered the expression of Foxp3 in Jurkat T cells, which was capable of being reversed by exogenous PGE2 . Our data revealed that ART may elicit an anti-tumor effect against cervical cancer by inhibition of PGE2 production in CaSki and Hela cells, which resulted in the decrease of Foxp3 expression in T cells. Therefore, ART may be an effective drug for immunotherapy of cervical cancer.",

Eighty-eight age- and gender-matched healthy individuals received physical examination in our hospital served as normal control. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of CRTC3 (rs3862434 and rs11635252) was evaluated using PCR amplification.For the SNP of CRTC3, significant differences were identified in rs3862434\u200a(AA/AG) and rs11635252\u200a(TT/CT/CC) between the 2 groups (P\u200a<\u200a.05). Statistical increase was noticed in the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in those with AG phenotype compared with those with AA phenotype in those with rs3862434. Significant decrease was identified in the total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and weight in those with CC phenotype compared with those with CT phenotype among the cases with rs11635252 (P\u200a<\u200a.05).CRTC3 polymorphism was associated with the onset of acute coronary syndrome in Han Chinese patients, which may be related to the imbalance of the lipid metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of tumor angiogenesis. Tumor cells are exposed to higher oxidative stress compared to normal cells. Numerous reports have demonstrated that the intracellular redox (oxidation/reduction) state is closely associated with the pattern of VEGF expression. Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) produced near the cathode during the electrolysis of water scavenged intracellular H(2)O(2) and decreased the release of H(2)O(2) from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549, and down-regulated both VEGF transcription and protein secretion in a time-dependent manner. To investigate the signal transduction pathway involved in regulating VEGF expression, mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) specific inhibitors, SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) and JNKi (c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase inhibitor) were applied. The results showed that only PD98059 blocks VEGF expression, suggesting an important role for ERK1/2 in regulating VEGF expression in A549 cells. As well, ERW inhibited the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in a time-dependent manner. Co-culture experiments to analyze in vitro tubule formation assay revealed that A549 cell-derived conditioned medium significantly stimulated the formation of vascular tubules in all analyzed parameters; tubule total area, tubule junction, number of tubules, and total tubule length. ERW counteracted the effect of A549 cell-conditioned medium and decreased total tube length (p<0.01). The present study demonstrated that ERW down-regulated VEGF gene transcription and protein secretion through inactivation of ERK.",

Previous reports suggested a possibility that Catalyser-21\u2122 has antioxidative potential and could inhibit angiogenesis and cancer cell invasiveness. Angiogenesis is a prerequisite for cancer cells to spread to surrounding tissues. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major angiogenic factor in the formation of blood capillaries by cancer cells to supply nutrients and oxygen for their sustained growth. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is another key enzyme for cancer cell metastasis. To assess the anti-angiogenic activity of Catalyser-21\u2122, we first examined cell viability using a human cervical cancer cell line, HeLa, and a fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080. The results showed that Catalyser-21\u2122 decreased the viability of both cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis proved that Catalyser-21\u2122 scavenges intracellular H2O2 in both cell types. RT-PCR demonstrated that both VEGF and MMP-2 gene transcription was suppressed after Catalyser-21\u2122 treatment.

        "abstract": "Electrolyzed reduced water, which is capable of scavenging reactive oxygen species, is attracting recent attention because it has shown improved efficacy against several types of diseases including diabetes mellitus. Alloxan produces reactive oxygen species and causes type 1 diabetes mellitus in experimental animals by irreversible oxidative damage to insulin-producing \u03b2-cells. Here, we showed that electrolyzed reduced water prevented alloxan-induced DNA fragmentation and the production of cells in sub-G1 phase in HIT-T15 pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Blood glucose levels in alloxan-induced type 1 diabetes model mice were also significantly suppressed by feeding the mice with electrolyzed reduced water. These results suggest that electrolyzed reduced water can prevent apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2-cells and the development of symptoms in type 1 diabetes model mice by alleviating the alloxan-derived generation of reactive oxygen species.",

Recently, Fucoidan has clinically got a lot attention due to its anti-tumor metastasis potential. We report here that the enzyme-digested fucoidan extract derived from Cladosiphon novae-caledoniae kylin, which was called \"mozuku\" in the Kingdom of Tonga, inhibited in vitro invasion of human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the enzyme-digested fucoidan extract effectively scavenged intracellular H2O2 of HT1080 cells. Both activities of MMP2 and 9 were decreased in a dose dependent manner by the fucoidan extract, suggesting that Fucoidan may inhibit the invasion of tumor cells via suppression of MMP2 and 9 activities.",

        "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is directly associated with elevated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression in several cell lines. Electrochemically reduced water (ERW), produced near the cathode during electrolysis, and scavenges intracellular H(2)O(2) in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. RT-PCR and zymography analyses revealed that when HT1080 cells were treated with ERW, the gene expression of MMP-2 and membrane type 1 MMP and activation of MMP-2 was repressed, resulting in decreased invasion of the cells into matrigel. ERW also inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced MMP-2 upregulation. To investigate signal transduction involved in MMP-2 downregulation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-specific inhibitors, SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), PD98059 (MAPK/extracellular regulated kinase kinase 1 inhibitor) and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase inhibitor II, were used to block the MAPK signal cascade. MMP-2 gene expression was only inhibited by SB203580 treatment, suggesting a pivotal role of p38 MAPK in regulation of MMP-2 gene expression. Western blot analysis showed that ERW downregulated the phosphorylation of p38 both in H(2)O(2)-treated and untreated HT1080 cells. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of ERW on tumor invasion is due to, at least in part, its antioxidative effect.",

        "abstract": "Fucoidan is a uniquely-structured sulfated polysaccharide found in the cell walls of several types of brown seaweed that has\n recently, especially as enzyme-digested fucoidan extract, attracted a lot attention due to its anti-tumor potential. In this\n study, we evaluated the effects of enzyme-digested fucoidan extracts prepared from seaweed Mozuku of Cladosiphon novae-caledoniae kylin on in vitro invasion and angiogenesis abilities of human tumor cells. First, we evaluated the effect of the fucoidan extracts on oxidative\n stress of tumor cells, and demonstrated that intracellular H2O2 level and released H2O2 from tumor cells were both greatly repressed upon the treatment with the fucoidan extracts, suggesting that fucoidan extracts\n ameliorate oxidative stress of tumor cells. Next, we tested for the effects of fucoidan extracts on invasion ability of human\n fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, showing that fucoidan extracts significantly inhibit their invasion, possibly via suppressing matrix\n metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP-2/9 activities. Further, we investigated the effects of the fucoidan extracts on angiogenesis\n of human uterine carcinoma HeLa cells, and found that fucoidan extracts suppressed expression and secretion of an angiogenesis\n factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), resulting in suppressed vascular tubules formation of tumor cells. The results\n taken together clarified that enzyme-digested fucoidan extracts from Cladosiphon novae-caledoniae kylin possess inhibitory effects on invasion and angiogenesis of tumor cells. These effects might, at least partially, be elicited\n by the antioxidative potential of enzyme digested fucoidan extracts.",

        "abstract": "In the two-stage cell transformation theory, cancer cells first receive initiation, which is mainly caused by DNA damage, and then promotion, which enhances transformation. Murine Balb/c 3T3 cells are widely used for transformation experiments because they lose contact inhibition ability when transformed. Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW), which is produced near a cathode during electrolysis of water, is an alkaline drinking water that is beneficial to health. ERW contains a high concentration of dissolved hydrogen and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with a small amount of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (Pt nps) derived from Pt-coated titanium electrodes. Pt nps stably disperse in aqueous solution for a long time, and convert hydrogen molecules to active hydrogen (atomic hydrogen) that can scavenge ROS. Therefore, ERW supplemented with synthesized Pt nps is a model strong reduced water. This is the first report that ERW supplemented with synthesized Pt nps strongly prevents transformation of Balb/c 3T3 cells. ERW was prepared by electrolysis of 0.002 M NaOH solution using a batch-type electrolysis device. Balb/c 3T3 cells were treated with 3-methyl cholanthrene (MCA) as an initiation substance, followed by treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) as a promotion substance. MCA/PMA-induced formation of a transformation focus was strongly suppressed by ERW supplemented with Pt nps but not by ERW or Pt nps individually. ERW supplemented with Pt nps suppressed transformation at the promoter stage, not at initiation, suggesting that ERW supplemented with Pt nps suppressed the PMA-induced augmentation of intracellular ROS. ERW supplemented with Pt nps is a potential new antioxidant against carcinogenesis.",

We utilize the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted aggregation operators to aggregate the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information corresponding to each alternative, and then with the ideal and anti-ideal information measures of IVIFS cross entropy, an objective function is constructed to derive the optimal evaluation for the weight of each alternative. The ranking of alternatives and the best one can be determined directly on the basis of the weights of alternatives.

To better describe the uncertain decision environment and solve the corresponding\n decision problem, multiple attribute group decision-making methods with completely unknown weights of both experts and attributes\n are proposed in intuitionistic fuzzy setting and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy setting. Entropy weight models can be\n used to determine the weights of both experts and attributes from intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrices or interval-valued\n intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrices, and then the evaluation formulas of weighted correlation coefficients between alternatives\n and the ideal alternative are introduced in intuitionistic fuzzy setting and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy setting.\n The alternatives can be ranked and the most desirable one(s) can be selected according to the values of the weighted correlation\n coefficients for IFSs or IVIFSs. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods: they\n are capable for handling the multiple attribute group decision-making problems with completely unknown weights.",

And then a new method of the fault diagnosis is proposed on the basis of the vague cross entropy and is applied to the fault diagnosis of turbine. The vague cross entropy between a testing sample and the knowledge of system faults is evaluated in the fault diagnosis of the turbine vibration. If the cross-entropy value is small, the testing sample is near to a type of fault knowledge. Then, the type of vibration fault is determined according to the minimum cross-entropy value.

These patients, 47 males and 26 females, were at a mean age of 1.93 months. BH(4) (20 mg/kg) loading test was performed in all patients, and a combined phenylalanine (Phe)(100 mg/kg) and BH(4) loading test was performed among the patient who had a basic blood Phe concentration less than 600 micro mol/L. The urine pterine profile analysis and the dihydropteridine reductase activity in dry blood filter spot were tested simultaneously.During BH(4) loading test or combined Phe and BH(4) loading test, the patients with classic phenylketonuria showed no response to BH(4), the patients with moderate HPA caused by Phe hydroxylase deficiency decreased 32.8% of blood Phe level and the patients with BH(4) deficiency showed a prompt reduction in blood Phe level and it decreased to normal level at 4 h and lasted until 24 h. Twenty-two cases were diagnosed as classic phenylketonuria, 39 were moderate phenylketonuria and 12 were BH(4) deficiency.Hyperphenylalaninemia may be caused by deficiency of Phe hydroxylase or by deficiency of co-factor BH(4). Early diagnosis is important. BH(4) loading test is a safe and fast test in vivo. It is sensitive, easy-to-do, and is highly useful in differential diagnosis for suspected cases of HPA.",

The aim of this study was to screen and diagnose BH(4) responsive PAH deficiency, to further understand its clinical characteristics, and to provide evidence for applying BH(4) drug therapy.BH(4) 20 mg/kg loading test was performed in 73 patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) (47 males and 26 females), the mean age was 1.93 months. Combined phenylalanine (100 mg/kg) and BH(4) loading test was performed if patients had a basic blood phenylalanine concentration less than 600 micromol/L. The urine pterin profile analysis and the dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity in dry blood filter spot were analyzed simultaneously. The patients with BH(4) responsive PAH deficiency were treated with BH(4) tablets (10 - 20 mg/kg x d) under normal diet for 6 to 7 days. Their blood phenylalanine concentration was checked.(1) The characteristic curve of phenylalanine level was observed in 73 patients after BH(4) loading test. Twenty-two patients were diagnosed as classic phenylketonuria (PKU), 39 were moderate PKU and 12 were BH(4) deficiency. (2) Twenty-two (56.4%) of 39 moderate PKU patients were found to be responsive to BH(4) and the blood phenylalanine was decreased by at least 30%. (3) Six patients with BH(4) responsive PAH deficiency were treated with BH(4) for 6 to 7 days, 4 patients had a normal phenylalanine concentration after 10 mg/kg BH(4) supplement, while other 2 patients needed a treatment of BH(4) at 20 mg/kg.Some patients with moderate PKU caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency were responsive to BH(4). Their blood phenylalanine significantly decreased after oral BH(4) loading. The BH(4) loading test is an effective diagnostic method to detect BH(4) sensitivity in PKU patients. BH(4) responsive PAH deficiency patient could be treated with BH(4) to replace low-phenylalanine diet treatment totally or partially, which may provide an optional treatment for the disease and improve the quality of life of the patients.",

        "abstract": "Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (CLAH) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder, characterized by deficiency of adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones. Recent studies have shown that mutations in the gene for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) cause this most severe genetic disorder in steroid hormone biosynthesis. StAR is a mitochondrial protein promotes cholesterol transfer from outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the cholesterol serves as a substrate for P450scc and initiates steroidogenesis. So far, more than 30 different mutations in the StAR gene have been found in the patients with CLAH from various ethnic groups. None of CLAH patients in the Chinese population has been previously reported. In the present study we analyzed the StAR gene in a Chinese patient with CLAH.The patient who was a 19-yr-old phenotypic female, has a 46, XY karyotype. Endocrinological evaluation was performed. Genomic DNA samples were abstracted from the bloods of the patient and his parents. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct DNA sequencing, family analysis and restriction enzyme digestion analysis were used to detect and confirm the mutations of StAR gene.Endocrine evaluation of the patient showed extremely elevated basal concentrations of serum ACTH and gonadotropin and minimal concentration of gonadal steroids. An ACTH stimulation test indicated basal serum dehydroepiandrosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were lower than normal detectable range and had no obvious increase after the ACTH stimulation. Automatic sequencing of 7 exons of the StAR gene with the polymerase chain reaction products of the genomic DNA revealed compound heterozygous for a novel nonsense mutation Q77X in exon 3 and the frameshift mutation 838delA in exon 6. The father carried Q77X mutation and the mother carried 838delA mutation. The restriction enzyme site of the Q77X mutation was examined by endonucleotidase BfaI. Furthermore, this mutation was not found in a series of 20 alleles of normal individuals.Q77X is the novel mutation found in the patient with CLAH. Q77X and 838delA compound mutations could inactivate the StAR function and give rise to clinically manifest CLAH. This case is the first Chinese patient with CLAH identified by molecular genetic analysis. DNA-based analysis of StAR gene will be helpful for the diagnosis of CLAH.",

The aim of this study was to compare chitotriosidase activity using 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-N, N', N\u2033-triacetyl-chitotrioside (4MU-C3) with 4-methylumbelliferyl 4-deoxy-\u03b2-D-chitobiose (4MU-4dC2) as substrates, and apply chitotriosidase activity measurement to help clinical determination of GD and NPD, and to monitor therapy in GD patients.Plasma of 45 healthy individuals, 31 patients with GD and 9 patients with NPD type A/B was collected from outpatient clinics of the Department of Pediatric Endocrinologic, Genetic and Metabolic Diseases, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Plasma chitotriosidase activity was measured with the substrates 4MU-C3 and 4MU-4dC2 respectively. Determinations were based on the methods described by Hollak et al and Rodrigues et al. Meanwhile, common mutation dup24 of the human chitotriosidase gene was detected.(1) Chitotriosidase activity when measured with 4MU-4dC2 gave higher values than 4MU-C3. In the healthy controls chitotriosidase activity was increased 3.7-fold when the 4MU-dC2 was used as substrate as compared with the 4MU-C3 (Z = -4.703, P < 0.001). In the untreated GD patients, the median value was increased 794-fold and 610-fold of the control subjects (Z = -3.823, P < 0.001) when the enzyme was measured with two substrates respectively. In the GD patients during therapy, chitotriosidase activity was increased 134-fold and 79-fold, and after changing therapeutic dose chitotriosidase activity was increased 215-fold and 118-fold of the controls (Z = -2.521, P < 0.05). In the NPD patients chitotriosidase activity was increased 8-fold and 14-fold of the controls (Z = -1.604, P = 0.109). (2) Consistent with the results of chitotriosidase activity, 30 of 85 (35.3%) individuals were homozygotes of dup24 mutation, which are completely chitotriosidase enzyme deficiency. Among GD patients with wild-type and heterozygotes for the dup24 mutation, chitotriosidase activity highly increased in the plasma compared with the controls.The use of 4MU-4dC2 as substrate makes chitotriosidase activity measurement more sensitive. The determination of plasma chitotriosidase activity is a useful tool to assist the clinical identification of Gaucher disease, and to monitor enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) of non-chitotriosidase deficient GD patients. Chitotriosidase activity determination has no value in the clinical identification of NPD.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To investigate the effect of tandem mass spectrometry on the differential diagnosis of organic acidemias. Methods Combined with gas- chromatography mass spectrometry,enzymetic activity determination,genomic mutation analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used for 2 566 children with high risk of genetic inborn metabolism di-seases to confirm the diagnosis of organic acidemias. The results were also compared among the patients with different diseases. Results Eighty- two patients were diagnosed as organic academia, including 44 patients with methylmalonicacademia (MMA),10 with propionic academia(PA),4 with biotinidase deficiency(BTD),and 2 with holocarboxylase sythetase deficiency . The propinoylcarnitine (C3) level in all these patients was higher than the upper limit value of normal control(4.0 \u03bcmol/L). The ratio of C3/C0(free carnitine)and C3/C2(acytylcarnitine)also exceed the upper limit normal level in patients with PA and MMA. The level of glycine was also elevated in PA patients, but normal in MMA patients. While the 3- hydyoxyl- isovalerylcarnitine (C5- OH) level increased significantly in the patients with BTD and holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency. In addition,increased C5- OH were also identified in patients with 3- methylcrotonyl- CoA carboxylase deficiency (MCC,5 cases),3- hydroxy- 3- methylglutaryl- CoA lyase deficiency (HMG,3 cases), and beta- keto thiolase deficiency(BKT,4 cases). C5- OH was the only finding in the former two diseases,but in patients with BKT,senecioyl- carnitine was also elevated significantly. Only was the isovalerylcarnitine level increased in 5 cases of isovaleric acidemias. In 3 cases with glutaric acidemia type\u2160,only was glutarylcarnitine increased. But in 2 cases with glutaric acidemia type\u2161,variety of the acylcarnitines was also increased. Conclusions The organic acidemias can be identified by analysis of acylcarnitines amino acids and the ratio of acylcarnitines with tandem mass spectrometry,which can also be used for differential diagnosis of various types of organic acidemias. But,in some patients with organic academia,the diagnosis should be confirmed with the organic acid analysis using urine gas- chromatography mass spectrometry.",

PCR-sequencing analysis was applied to detect the mutations in GLB1 of the patient.The patient was characterized by dwarfism, pectus carinatum, kyphosis, normal intelligence, and no neurologic damage of spasms, linguistic capacity and so on. The patient had normal GALNS enzyme activity and very low GLB1 enzyme activity [5.03 nmol/(h\u00b7mg) vs. normal value 118 - 413 nmol/(h\u00b7mg) ] in leukocytes. A compound heterozygous missense mutations c.442C > T(p.R148C)/c.1454A > G(p.Y485C) in GLB1 gene were detected in this patient. The mutation p.Y485C is a novel variant. With the method of gene analysis of new variant, the mutation p.Y485C was considered to be a pathogenic mutation.The MPS IVB patient showed severe multiple skeletal deformities, normal intelligence, no neurologic damage and very low GLB1 enzyme activity, who carries compound heterozygous mutations p.R148C/p.Y485C. The mutation p.Y485C in GLB1 gene may be a novel pathologic mutation of MPS type IVB.",

        "abstract": "Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPD) (MIM#208230) is a rare autosomal recessive disease of cartilage homeostasis characterized by axial and peripheral skeletal dysplasia. Analysis of WISP3 (Wnt1-inducible signaling pathway protein 3, MIM#603400) gene mutation can confirm the clinical and radiographic diagnosis for PPD. This study aimed to recognize PPD based on clinical manifestations and imaging characteristics of bones, and to investigate the mutations of WISP3 gene in three patients with PPD.Three male patients (9 - 16 years old) from three unrelated Chinese families, who presented with joint pain, swelling, deformities and motion limitation, were referred to this study. PPD was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics of bones and laboratory evaluation. All five exons and their exon/intron boundaries of the WISP3 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the peripheral blood DNA of three PPD family members, and mutation analysis was performed by bidirectional DNA sequencing.(1) Three patients were diagnosed as PPD by characteristic evidences: all patients presented with non-inflammatory multiple joints swelling and stiffness including joints in hand and feet as they age. Radiographs showed platyspondyly, ovoid or wedged anterior end-plate of vertebral bodies, coxa vara, widened epiphyses or metaphyses including capital femoral, metacarpophalangeal, interphalangeal joints and metatarsals. Normal laboratory values were found for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factors, antinuclear antibodies etc. (2) The three different mutations of WISP3 gene were identified in three patients with PPD, including two small insert mutations (c.624_625insA, c.866_867insA), one was deletion mutation (c.729_735delGAGAAAA). The types of mutation of two alleles in three patients were c.624_625insA/c.729_735delGAGAAAA, c.624_625insA/c.866_867insA and c.866_867 insA/c.866_867insA, respectively. These mutations were found in exon 4 and exon 5 of WISP3 gene, accounting for 50%(3/6) respectively. All three different mutations were novel variations, and none of 3 novel variations was found in the 50 controls.The characteristic evidences of PPD were non-inflammatory multiple enlarged joints (including hand and feet), limited movement, normal laboratory values such as rheumatoid factors. It is essential for making diagnosis to carefully examine the entire skeleton including spine. The characteristics of bone imaging are platyspondyly, widened epiphyses or metaphyses including large and small joints and narrow joint spaces. Three different novel variations of WISP3 gene were identified in three PPD patients, they are c.624_625insA, c.866_867insA and c.729_735delGAGAAAA. Each of novel mutations is insert or deletion mutation.",

        "abstract": "Very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is an inherited metabolic disease caused by deleterious mutations in the ACADVL gene that encodes very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), and which can present as cardiomyopathy in neonates, as hypoketotic hypoglycemia in infancy, and as myopathy in late-onset patients. Although many ACADVL mutations have been described, no prevalent mutations in the ACADVL gene have been associated with VLCADD. Herein, we report the clinical course of the disease and explore the genetic mutation spectrum in seven Chinese patients with VLCADD.Seven Chinese patients, from newborn to 17 years old, were included in this study. Tandem mass spectrometry was performed to screen for VLCAD deficiency. All exons and flanking introns of the ACADVL gene were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Online analysis tools were used to predict the impact of novel mutations.All cases had elevated serum levels of tetradecanoylcarnitine (C14:1) which is the characteristic biomarker for VLCADD. The phenotype of VLCADD is heterogeneous. Two patients were hospitalized for hypoactivity and hypoglycemia shortly after birth. Three patients showed hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia in infancy. The other two adolescent patients showed initial manifestations of exercise intolerance or rhabdomyolysis. Three of the patients died at the age of 6-8 months. Eleven different mutations in the ACADVL gene in the 7 patients were identified, including seven reported mutations (p.S22X, p.W427X, p.A213T, p.G222R, p.R450H, c.296-297delCA, c.1605+1G>T) and four novel mutations (p.S72F, p.Q100X, p.M437T, p.D466Y). The p.R450H and p.D466Y (14.28%, 2/14 alleles) mutations were identified in two alleles respectively.The clinical manifestations were heterog-eneous and ACADVL gene mutations were heterozygous in the seven VLCADD Chinese patients. R450H may be a relatively common mutation in Asian populations. The genotype and phenotype had a certain correlation in our patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the acid \u03b1-glucosidase(GAA)gene mutations and clinical features of a Chinese patient exhibiting signs and symptoms of infantile glycogen storage disease type \u2161(GSD \u2161).Methods Clinical features of the patient were reviewed,and GAA activity in the patient's and her parents' whole leukocytes were measured.GAA coding regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction(PCR),and analyzed by direct DNA sequencing.Results The patient showed feeding difficulties,generalized hypotonia and weakness starting at 2 months of age.Cardiomegaly and cardiomyopathy were found at 4 months.She died of cardiorespiratory failure at the age of 6 months.GAA activity in leukocytes was low in the patient(17.3% of the median normal range).Genotyping revealed the patient was a heterozygote for a novel nonsense mutation p.W738X and a previously reported nonsense mutation p.E888X.The reported pseudodeficiency allele c.[1726G > A;2065G > A]was found in the patient and her mother.Conclusions Correct diagnosis was made for this patient by combination of GAA activity assay and genetic analysis.From the clinical course,this patient should be classified as infantile type of GSD \u2161,suggesting that the novel mutation p.W738X may have a damaging effect on the function of GAA.Pseudodeficiency allele found in this family highlights the importance of genetic analysis of GAA when performing diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis for the affected families,as this allele causes low GAA activity in normal individuals.",

        "abstract": "To establish the diagnostic method of tyrosinemia type 1 and evaluate its value, the succinylacetone levels in the blood of suspected patients with tyrosinemia were tested by tandem mass spectrometry, and the succinylacetone in the urine was tested by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.A total of 190 patients suspected of having tyrosinemia, were tested by tandem mass spectrometry for measurement of the level of succinylacetone in the blood, and detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for measurement of the level of succinylacetone and organic acid in the urine. The method of measuring the level of succinylacetone in blood by tandem mass spectrometry as follows: After the diameter of 3 mm dry blood spots were punched into wells of 96-well plate, 100 \u00b5l 80% acetonitrile were added into each well, which contained hydrazine monohydrate and the internal standard of succinylacetone. The supernatant fluid were transferred to another 96-well plate and dried under heated nitrogen, after the plate was incubated for 30 min at 65\u00b0C. The residual hydrazine reagent was removed by addition of 100 \u00b5l methanol to each well and evaporated under heated nitrogen. The mobile phase (80% acetonitrile) was added to each well and 20 \u00b5l samples were tested by tandem mass spectrometry. The diagnostic terms were the clinical manifestation and the high level of succinylacetone in both blood and urine.Eleven patients were diagnosed as tyrosinemia type 1, with 9 males and 2 females. Their ages ranged from 2 months to 6 years. The succinylacetone levels in the blood of the patients were remarkably increased (7.26-31.09 \u00b5mol/L), with an average of (14.2 \u00b1 7.8)\u00b5mol/L. Seven patients were tested for the level of succinylacetone in the urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 4 were positive and 3 negative. Their tyrosine levels in the blood were 190-543 \u00b5mol/L(Normal: 20 - 100 \u00b5mol/L), with an average of (327.3 \u00b1 125.8) \u00b5mol/L. All the patients presented the symptoms of hepatomegaly. Among them, 9 patients died and 2 patients were improved after treatment.The higher levels of succinylacetone in the blood or urine is a remarkable evidence for the diagnosis of tyrosinemia type 1. Determination of succinylacetone in the dry blood spots using tandem mass spectrometry was a good method for diagnosis of tyrosinemia type 1. To test succinylacetone in urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry may yield a false-negative result for tyrosinemia type 1.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the incidence of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) caused by different etiologic factors in China and the relationship between the phenylalanine and mental development of patients with HPAs who were diagnosed by neonatal screening and early treated.Two hundred and twenty-three patients with HPA detected by neonatal screening programs were refered to us at the age of (41 +/- 27) days after birth. The differential diagnosis was performed by BH(4) (20 mg/kg) loading test, urinary pterin analysis and dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity determination respectively. The control of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism, growth and mental development were evaluated in all treated patients. Related gene mutation analysis was performed in some patientsOne hundred and twenty-nine of 223 patients (57.8%) were diagnosed as phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (PAHD), 64 patients (28.7%) as BH(4) responsive PAHD, 30 patients (13.5%) as 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase deficiency (PTSD). One hundred and forty-nine patients were followed at age of 4 m - 2 y in our clinic. The 136 of 149 patients were treated according to different etiology at the age of 1.6 m (0.5 - 3.5 m) after birth. Thirteen patients were followed up without the need for treatment. All patients had normal growth development. One hundred and eight (79.4%) of 136 treated patients had normal mental development. The negative correlation (r = -0.439, P < 0.01) between IQ and average Phe levels were observed in 58 patients. Twenty-eight patients were able to go to primary school or even university. Nine kinds of PTS gene mutations were found in 9 cases with PTSD, among which 286G-->A and 259C-->T were most commonly seen, accounting for 45%. Seven kinds of PAH gene mutations were found in 13 cases with BH(4) responsive PAHD with the R241C (43.8%) mutation being the most frequent one.The differential diagnosis should be quickly made in all HPA patients detected by neonatal screening. Near 80% patients early treated had normal mental development. The good control of blood Phe level is a key factor for mental development.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the effect of high concentration of phenylalanine (Phe) on Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) expression in the cortical neurons of rats in vitro in order to investigate whether NgR is involved in the etiology of Phe-induced brain damage.Neurons from the cerebral cortex of embryonic rats were cultured for 3 days and then were treated with 0.9 mM Phe. After 12, 24 and 48 hrs of Phe treatment, mRNA and protein expression of NgR was detected by real-time PCR and Western blot respectively. Growth cones and growth axons of neurons were detected by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry respectively after 12 and 24 hrs of Phe treatment.The length of growth axons of neurons was significantly shorter after 12 and 24 hrs of Phe treatment compared with the control group without Phe treatment (P<0.05). Growth cones collapse occurred in 12.5+/-9.7% and 24.1+/-4.5% of neurons respectively after 12 and 24 hrs of Phe treatment but only in 3.5+/-1.5% in the control group (P<0.01). The protein level of NgR after 12, 24 and 48 hrs of Phe treatment was up-regulated, with 9.0, 9.4 and 12.6 times as the control. mRNA level of NgR in the Phe treatment group did not differ from control.High concentration of Phe can induce an increased NgR protein expression in cortical neurons, and the increased NgR expression may contribute to the growth cones collapse and the inhibitory activities of axon regeneration after injury.",

        "abstract": "Many children were found to have low free carnitine level in blood by tandem mass spectrometry technology. In some of the cases the problems occurred secondary to malnutrition, organic acidemia and other fatty acid oxidation metabolic diseases, and some of cases had primary carnitine deficiency (PCD). In the present article, we discuss the diagnosis of PCD and evaluate the efficacy of carnitine in the treatment of PCD.We measured the free carnitine (C0) and acylcarnitine levels in the blood of 270 000 neonates from newborns screening program and 12 000 children with suspected clinical inherited metabolic diseases by tandem mass spectrometry. The mutations of carnitine transporter protein were tested to the children with low C0 level and the diagnosis was made. The children with PCD were treated with 100 - 300 mg/kg of carnitine.Seventeen children were diagnosed with PCD, 6 from newborn screening program and 11 from clinical patients. Mutations were found in all of them. The average C0 level [(2.9 \u00b1 2.0) \u00b5mol/L] in patients was lower than the reference value (10 \u00b5mol/L), along with decreased level of different acylcarnitines. The clinical manifestations were diverse. For the 6 patients from newborn screening, 4 were asymptomatic, 1 showed hypoglycaemia and 1 showed movement intolerance from 2 years of age. For the 11 clinical patients, 8 showed hepatomegaly, 7 showed myasthenia, 6 showed cardiomyopathy, 1 showed chronic abdominal pain, and 1 showed restlessness and learning difficulty. Among these patients, 14 cases were treated with carnitine. Their clinical symptoms disappeared 1 to 3 months later. The C0 level in the blood rose to normal, with the average from (4.0 \u00b1 2.7) \u00b5mol/L to (20.6 \u00b1 8.3) \u00b5mol/L (P < 0.01). However, the level was still lower than the average level of healthy children [(27.1 \u00b1 4.5) \u00b5mol/L, P < 0.01].Seventeen patients were diagnosed with PCD by the test levels of free carnitine and acylcarnitines in blood with tandem mass spectrometry, and gene mutation test. Large dose of carnitine had a good effect in treatment of the PCD patients.",

        "abstract": "Glycogen storage disease type II (GSD II, Pompe disease) is caused by the deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) that leads to lysosomal glycogen accumulation. Early diagnosis and treatment of GSD II are considered to be critical for maximum efficacy of the enzyme replacement therapy. The aim of this study was to introduce two reliable methods and to generate the reference range of GAA activity.The assay of GAA activity was performed in dried blood spots (DBS) and mixed leukocytes with acarbose to eliminate isoenzyme interference and to generate the reference range. GAA activity was assayed in 700 specimens for DBS from normal subjects and 100 specimens for mixed leukocytes from normal subjects to set up reference range. GAA activity in the samples of 4 patients who were clinically suspected of GSD II and their parents were also assayed.The intra-run and inter-run precision of the DBS method was less than 10%. GAA activity tested by DBS was stable for 28 days between room temperature and -80 degrees C. The reference range of newborns and children-adults in DBS samples was 8.92 - 60.03 pmol/(punch x h) and 8.00 - 37.43 pmol/(punch x h), respectively. The reference range in mixed leukocytes samples was 12.56 - 50.26 nmol/(mg protein x h). Four patients were diagnosed as GSD II with the above-mentioned two methods.The determination of GAA activity in DBS is sensitive and time-saving, and is suitable for high throughput analysis and newborn screening for GSD II. The assay of GAA activity in mixed leukocytes is accurate, fast and specific, and is suitable for final diagnosis of GSD II.",

        "abstract": "Glycogen debranching enzyme (AGL) plays an important role in complete degradation of the glycogen, and has two independent catalytic activities, i.e., those of alpha-1, 4-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4. 1.25) and amylo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2. 1.33). A deficiency in activities of AGL causes excessive accumulation of glycogen with short branched outer chains and results in glycogen storage disease type III (GSD III; MIM #232 400), an autosomal recessive inborn disorder of glycogen metabolism. The present study aimed to investigate the mutation of AGL in 10 Chinese patients with GSD III.Clinical and laboratory data of 10 patients with typical clinical manifestations of GSD III suggesting hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, increased creatine-phosphokinase and its isozyme were collected. The coding regions and their flanking introns of AGL gene of the 10 patients were amplified by PCR and analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. All the mutated alleles were confirmed by bidirectional DNA sequencing. The 3 novel splicing mutations were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in 50 healthy children (control). The 2 small deletions (c.408-411delTTTG, c.2717-2721delAGATC) were analyzed by fluorescent polymerase chain reaction and gene scan analysis to confirm the number of deleted bases.Thirteen different mutations were identified, including 4 splicing mutations (IVS6 + 1G > A, IVS6-1G > A, IVS14 + 1G > T, IVS26-2A > C), 5 nonsense mutations (R469X, R864X, S929X, R977X, Y1428X), 3 small deletions (c.408-411delTTTG, c.2717-2721delAGATC, c.2823delT) and 1 insert mutation (c.4234insT). Except for IVS14 + 1G > T, R864X, and R977X, the other 10 mutations are novel; 18 mutated alleles were identified in the 20 alleles (90%). IVS14 + 1G > T was the most frequently seen mutation, accounting for 5 of 20 (25%) alleles examined. None of homozygote and heterozygote of the 3 novel splicing mutations was found in the 50 healthy controls by RFLP analysis. With the fluorescent polymerase chain reaction and gene scan analysis, c.408411deTTTG mutation and c.2717-2721delAGATC mutation were confirmed to have 4 and 5 bases deletion respectively.Thirteen mutations were identified in the 10 cases with GSD III, with 10 novel mutations. IVS14 + 1G > T was a relatively common mutation. This study revealed the heterozygosity of AGL gene in Chinese patients with GSD III.",

Mutation in either gene cause propionic acidemia, the PCCA gene is located on chromosome 13q32 with 24 exons and the PCCB gene is located on chromosome 3q13.2-q22 with 15 exons. In this study, we analyzed gene mutations of 11 PCCA and PCCB deficient patients from China and to explore the possible mutation spectrum.All 39 exons of PCCA and PCCB genes in 11 unrelated Chinese PA patients were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform method from the peripheral blood leukocytes of each patient. PCR amplification products were checked by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and were subsequently sequenced with ABI 3700 Automated DNA Sequencer.The authors identified 13 PA mutations, 8 affecting the PCCA gene, 5 affecting the PCCB gene, including 10 novel mutations and 3 previously reported mutations. Three missense mutations (1079T > G, 1102G > C and 1850T > C), one splicing mutation (716-2A > G) and one short deletion (1863delA) were found in alpha-PCC subunit while three missense mutations (484G > A, 601G > A and 1253C > T) and two short insertion-deletions (167-179del13ins1, 560-561delCCinsT) were found in beta-PCC subunit.

Patients with this disease can progress to death without timely and effective treatment. This study aimed to analyze the treatment outcomes of patients with combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria.From September 2004 to April 2012, 58 patients with combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria (34 males and 24 females) were diagnosed and treated in our hospital. Fifty cases were from clinical patients including 42 early-onset cases and 8 late-onset cases. Their age when they were diagnosed ranged from 18 days to 30.8 years. The other 8 cases were from newborn screening. All the patients were treated with vitamin B12, betaine, folic acid, vitamin B6, and L-carnitine. The physical and neuropsychological development, general laboratory tests, the levels of amino acids, acylcarnitines, and homocysteine in blood, and organic acids in urine were followed up.The follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 7.1 years. Three cases died (all were early-onset cases). In the other patients after treatment, the symptoms such as recurrent vomiting, seizures, lethargy, and poor feeding disappeared, muscle strength and muscle tension were improved, and general biochemical abnormalities such as anemia and metabolic acidosis were corrected. Among the surviving 55 cases, 49 had neurological impairments such as developmental delay and mental retardation. The median levels of blood propionylcarnitine and its ratio with acetylcarnitine, serum homocysteine, and urine methylmalonic acid were significantly decreased (P < 0.01), from 7.73 \u00b5mol/L (ranged from 1.5 to 18.61 \u00b5mol/L), 0.74 (ranged from 0.29 to 2.06), 97.3 \u00b5mol/L (ranged from 25.1 to 250 \u00b5mol/L) and 168.55 (ranged from 3.66 to 1032.82) before treatment to 2.74 \u00b5mol/L (ranged from 0.47 to 12.09 \u00b5mol/L), 0.16 (ranged from 0.03 to 0.62), 43.8 \u00b5mol/L (ranged from 17 to 97.8 \u00b5mol/L) and 6.81 (ranged from 0 to 95.43) after treatment, respectively.Patients with combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria respond to a combined treatment consisting of supplementation of hydroxycobalamin, betaine, folic acid, vitamin B6 and L-carnitine with clinical and biochemical improvement. But the long-term outcomes are unsatisfactory, with neurological sequelae in most patients.",

        "title": "Analysis of gene mutations in Chinese patients with methylmalonic acidemia and homocysteinemia]",
        "abstract": "Methylmalonic acidemia complicated with homocysteinemia, cblC type, is the most common inborn error of cobalamin metabolism. The gene MMACHC (OMIM 277400) is located on chromosome 1p34.1 with four coding exons and a 5th non-coding exon. It encodes for a protein with 282 amino acid residues. So far, more than 40 mutations have been detected, in which 271dupA (R91KfsX14) is the hot spot of MMACHC gene. However, there have not been relevant reports in China. The present study aimed to identify the mutation types of MMACHC gene and analyze the genotype-phenotype correlations in Chinese patients.The diagnosis of this disease mainly depends on the measurement of C3 propionylcarnitine, C3/C0 (free carnitine) and C3/C2 (acetylcarnitine) in the blood by tandem mass spectrometry, the detection of methylmalonic acid in the urine by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry, the determination of total homocysteine in the serum, and the loading test of vitamin B12. The entire coding region of MMACHC gene was screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with DNA direct sequencing in 28 Chinese patients. Genomic DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform method from the peripheral blood leukocytes of each patient. PCR amplification products were checked by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and were subsequently sequenced with both the forward and reverse primers. Mutational analyses were performed using normal human genomic MMACHC sequence as a reference (GenBank ID: 25974).In this study, ten mutations were identified in 27 of 28 Chinese patients. Most of them were located in exons 3 and 4 (91.3%). We detected four mutations reported, which were 609G>A (W203X), 217C>T (R73X), 271dupA (R91KfsX14), and 394C>T (R132X), and six novel mutations, which were 1A>G, 365A>T, 658_660delAAG, 301-3_327del 30, 567_568insT, and 625_626insT. The 609G>A (W203X) is the most common mutation, which was detected in 30 of 56 alleles (53.6%), including 10 homozygote mutations and 10 heterozygote mutations. In addition, three gene polymorphisms were detected, namely, -302T>G (rs3748643), -234A>G (rs3728644), and 321G>A (rs2275276). These mutations include missense mutations, nonsense mutations, duplication, deletions, and insertions.In this study, we found a part of gene mutations spectrum in Chinese patients with methylmalonic acidemia and homocysteinemia, in which the 609G>A (W203X) may be the hotspot mutation of MMACHC gene. This would be helpful in the prenatal diagnosis and gene screening programs of methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinemia.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To report the clinical diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of children with holocarboxylase synthetas(HCS) deficiency and explore the gene mutation spectrum of the disease. Methods: Eleven children with HCS deficiency were enrolled. Mass spectrometry analysis and biotinidase activity determination were used for diagnosis of HCS deficiency. HCS gene mutations were analyzed by PCR directed sequencing methods. Ten patients received oral biotin treatment (10-40 mg/d). Clinical effects of biotin treatment were observed. Results: All 11 cases developed apathetic, lethargy and metabolic acidosis at different degrees, and 10 cases presented with skin lesions. The average blood 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-carnitine concentrations and urinary 3- methylcrontonylglycine and methylcitrate concentrations increased significantly. The biotinidase activity increased, being higher over 30% of the normal reference value. Four mutations in HCS gene were identified, and they were c. 1522C > T (R508W), c. 1088T > A (V363D), c. 126G > T (E42D) and c. 1994G > C (R665P) (a new variant) and the frequency was 50% , 29% , 7% and 14% respectively. The symptoms disappeared in 10 cases 1-2 weeks after biotin treatment, and blood and urinary abnormal metabolites were gradually reduced to normal 2-6 months after treatment. Conclusions: HCS deficiency is characterized by nervous system damage, skin lesions and metabolic acidosis. Mass spectrometry analysis, biotinidase activity determination and gene mutation analysis may be helpful in the definite diagnosis of this disorder. The effect of early biotin treatment is satisfactory. The mutations R508W and V363D might be hot-spots in Chinese children with HCS deficiency.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the development of differential diagnosis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency among patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) in provinces or cities of China and to investigate the incidence of BH4 deficiency.Of the thirteen hundreds and ninety-two patients with HPA received, the differential diagnosis for BH4 deficiency during 1993 - 2007 were enrolled in this study. Of which, 591 patients came from outpatient and 801 patients' samples from other provinces or cities were sent to author's laboratory to investigate the case number of differential diagnosis for BH4 deficiency in provinces or cities of China according to the data from both outpatient case histories and laboratory as to investigating the development of differential diagnosis in the whole country. To discuss the diagnostic criteria for BH4 deficiency was according to the results of urinary pterin analysis, determination of dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity and the tetrahydrobiopterin loading test as well as to get the incidence of BH4 deficiency and find some provinces or cities with higher incidence of BH4 deficiency in China.(1) The number of HPA patients, who were performed by urinary pterin analysis and the determination of DHPR activity, were remarkably increased in last three years (2005 - 2007). The patient numbers of both urinary pterin analysis and DHPR activity determination were 217 and 198 respectively in 2005. And in 2007 they increased to 511 and 458, which was about 2.3 times than that in 2005. The patients came from 29 provinces or cities in 2007. (2) The urinary biopterin and biopterin percent were key marks for diagnosis of 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency. The less than 5% [(1.41 +/- 1.10)%] biopterin percent and very low biopterin level [(0.14 +/- 0.17) mmol/mol Cr] were found in 96.83% (61/63) patients with PTPS deficiency in this study. The blood phenylalanine level was remarkably decreased to normal range at 2 - 6 hours after BH4 loading test. The very low DHPR activity was a final diagnostic mark for DHPR deficiency. The very low DHPR activities of 0.27 nmol/(min x 5 mm disc) (6.11% - 7.00% of normal controls) were found in two patients with DHPR deficiency in this study. (3) The incidences of PTPS deficiency and DHPR deficiency among 1392 patients with hyperphenylalaninemia were 8.41% (117/1392) and 0.18% (2/1108) respectively. About 67.23% (80/119) patients with BH4 deficiency came from the south of Yangtze liver. The 80% (8/10) provinces or cities with higher incidence of BH4 deficiency are located in eastern and southern China. The incidence of PTPS deficiency among patients with HPA and normal newborns was 10.81% (8/74) and 0.007 per thousand (8/1,121,429) respectively in Shanghai, China according to data from neonatal screening.The awareness of differential diagnosis for BH4 deficiency from clinic pediatricians has been increased in most provinces or cities of China in last three years, but it should be more strengthened.",

        "abstract": "The new technology of tandem mass spectrometry is exerting a significant impact on the diagnostics of inborn metabolic errors, and allows to detect a number of these disorders in a single step. The aim of the present study was to establish a dry blood filter paper method for amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles test using tandem mass spectrometry and to apply the method for selective screening in high risk children with inborn error of metabolism.The study group consisted of 104 high risk cases of inborn error of metabolism from 5 pediatric hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing were tested from November 2002 to June 2003; 77 were males and 27 females, the means age was 4.8 +/- 4.2 years. These patients had mental retardation, slow development, psychological abnormalities, muscle hypotonia, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent vomiting, and convulsion. Laboratory examinations suggested metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia and hyperlactacidemia. Phenylketonuria was excluded in this study by routine phenylalanine screening. The control group consisted of 308 children, 170 males and 138 females. The blood was collected on filter paper, punched and extracted into methanol solution with stable isotope labeled internal standards, then derivatized with butanolic-HCl. After preparation, the samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (API 2000).Ten of 104 patients (9.6%) were positive in our selective screening program, including one with tyrosinemia, one with homocystinuria, one with hyperornithinemia, two with methylmalonic acidemia, one with propionic acidemia, one with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, two with medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, and one with carnitine palmitoyl transferase type II deficiency.The authors established a fast, accurate and sensitive tandem mass spectrometry method for amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles analysis, nearly 30 metabolic diseases including amino acid disorders, organic acid disorders and fatty acid oxidation disorders could be detected, most of the diseases that cause death and disability represent preventable entities by early diagnosis and treatment. The results indicated the importance of selective screening for high risk patients with inborn error of metabolism.",

QDPR gene mutations were analyzed and confirmed by routine methods. The potential pathogenicity of missense variants was analyzed using Clustal X, PolyPhen program and Swiss-PDB Viewer 4.04_OSX software, respectively. The clinical outcomes of the patients were evaluated after long-term treatment.In 10 mutations of the 9 patients, 4 were novel mutations (G20V, V86D, G130S and A175R), 4 were reported by us previously, and 2 known mutations were identified. R221X was a hotspot mutation (27.7%) in our patients. Eight missense mutations probably had damage to protein. Six patients in this series were treated with a good control of phenylalanine level. The height and weight of the patients were normal at the age of 4 months to 7.5 years. Four patients, who underwent a neonatal screening and were treated early, showed a normal mental development. In 2 patients diagnosed late, neurological symptoms were significantly improved.The mutation spectrum of the QDPR gene is different in the Chinese population. Most mutations are related to severe phenotype. The determination of DHPR activity should be performed in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia. DHPR-deficient patients who were treated below the age of 2 months may have a near normal mental development.",

Genomic DNA samples were extracted from the blood of three GSD Ia patients and their parents, from the amniocytes of 3 fetuses and the blood of 2 newborns. By the way of restriction enzyme analysis, the screening for 727G-->T and R83H mutations of glucose-6-phosphatase gene was carried out in conjunction with 1176 nucleotide polymorphism linkage analysis so as to make the gene and prenatal diagnosis of 3 GSD Ia families. Direct DNA sequencing of the corresponding PCR products was used to confirm the unveiled mutations and 1176 nucleotide polymorphism.Three probands were homozygotes for the 727G-->T mutation and their parents were heterozygotes for this mutation. The fetuses of family 1 and 3 were heterozygotes for the 727G-->T mutation, whereas the fetus of family 2 did not carry this mutation. The 1176 nucleotide polymorphisms of 3 fetuses were different from those of the corresponding probands. The prenatal diagnoses of family 1 and 2 were confirmed by the postnatal biochemical and molecular studies.These findings suggest that the screening for 727G-->T and R83H mutations in conjunction with the 1176 polymorphism linkage analysis be a simple, fast and accurate method for gene and prenatal diagnosis of GSD Ia in Chinese.",

        "abstract": "The diagnosis of organic acidemia is very difficult and needs special test methods. Recently the tandem mass spectrometry has been used in screening for and diagnosis of this inborn error of metabolism. The aim of the present study was to utilize a dry blood filter paper method for acylcarnitines profiles test using tandem mass spectrometry in diagnosis of organic acidemias in high risk children.One thousand patients (642 were males and 358 females) with high risk of inborn error of metabolism were studied, the median of their age was 2 years. The blood specimens were collected on filter paper, punched and extracted into methanol solution with stable isotope labeled internal standards of acylcarnitine, then derivatized with butanolic-HCI. After preparation, the samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. The volume of the acylcarnitines was calculated with special software.Forty patients (4.0%) were diagnosed as organic acidemias among the 1000 patients, including 20 methylmalonic acidemia, 6 propionic acidemia, 3 isovaleric acidemia, 3 glutaric acidemia type I, 3 glutaric acidemia type II, 2 biotinidas deficiency, 1 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency, 1 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, and 1 beta-keto thiolase deficiency. The common clinical symptoms and signs of these patients were motor and mental developmental retardation, spasm, lethargy, coma, hypotonia, vomiting, and feeding difficulty. Routine laboratory tests suggested metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, hyperlactacidemia, hypoglycemia, anemia, and abnormal liver function.A part of organic acidemias can be rapidly diagnosed by tandem mass spectrometry through acylcarnitine profiles analysis in dry blood filter paper. Combination of tandem mass spectrometry with urine gas chromatography mass spectrometry would improve more accurate diagnosis of organic acidemias.",

        "abstract": "Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of leucine metabolism caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) resulting in the accumulation of derivatives of isovaleryl-CoA. IVA is considered to be a severe, potentially life-threatening disorder that manifests with acute neonatal encephalopathy in approximately half of affected individuals, and recurrent episodes of vomiting, lethargy, coma and varying degrees of developmental delay in the other half of patients. This study was conducted to investigate the clinical features and IVD gene mutations of a Chinese patient with IVA.The clinical features, routine laboratory data, blood amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles and urinary organic acid profiles of a patient with IVA were reviewed. Whole coding exons of IVD gene were PCR-amplified for DNA sequencing. The novel mutation c.466G > C (G127A) was confirmed by RFLP with restriction endonuclease Hph I.The patient was a 2 year and 7 month-old boy. At 3 days of age, he began to show severe vomiting and acidosis. He was treated with pyloromyotomy at 10 days of age. His recurrent vomiting was not ameliorated until beginning transition to a diet that included more carbohydrate from 4 months. He had 3 recurrent severe vomiting and acidosis later and showed obvious psychomotor retardation. Blood spot acylcarnitine profiles by MS-MS demonstrated an elevation of C5-carnitine with a peak concentration of 12.89 micromol/L (< 0.5 micromol/L). Organic acid analysis of urine by GC-MS revealed a relatively high level of isovaleric glycine. Mutational analysis of the patient's IVD gene revealed heteroallelic mutations of c.149G > A (R21H) and c.466G > C (G127A) which is a novel missense mutation. G127A mutation was not detected in any of 50 normal controls.From the clinical course, obvious elevation of blood C5-carnitine and urine isovaleric glycine, this patient's disorder should be classified as \"metabolically severe\" type of IVA which suggest that c.466G > C (G127A) mutation could severely damage the function of the IVD protein. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of IVD gene mutations in the mainland of China.",

Methods Two hundred and seventy-eight patients with developmental delay were enrolled in the study. Blood amino acids and acylcarnintines profiles were tested with tandem mass spectrometry. Gas chro- matography / mass spectrometry (GC / MS) analysis of urine and enzyme activity tests were further made when the patients were suspected to have metabolic disorders. Clinical data of the patients with inborn errors of metabolism were also ana- lyzed. Results Seventeen of 278 patients (6.15% ) with metabolic disorders were confirmed, including methylmalonic acidemia (MMA)(4), methylmalonic acidemia complicated with homocystinuria (4), propionic acidemia (PA) (3), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (1), maple syrup urine disease (1), glutaric acidemia type\u2160 (1), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)(1), phenylketonuria (1), and biotinidase deficiency (1) . The clinical manifestations were di- verse, including mental retardation or regression, seizure, coma, vomiting, hypotonia, malnutrition, lethargy, frequent infections, etc. Laboratory findings included metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, hyperlacticemia, and anemia. MRI findings included cerebral atrophy, a pattern of T2 higher signal intensity and / or T1 lower signal intensity in cerebral white matter and multiple encephalomalacia or cystic changes, etc. MMA patients, early-onset with severe acidosis and coma, with no response to the treatment of vitamin B12, had a poor prognosis. Improvement was observed in 11 patients after treatment with special milk, low-protein diet, carnitine, vitamin B12 and biotin, etc. Four MMA patients and 1 PA pa- tients died, 1 MLD patient unchanged. Conclusions Screening tests of inherited metabolic disorders should be performed in children with developmental delay with unknown etiology. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment might improve the prognosis.",

        "title": "Analysis of GALNS gene mutation in thirty-eight Chinese patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA]",
        "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IVA (MPS IVA) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS) needed to degrade glycosaminoglycanes (GAGs), accumulation of GAGs in the tissue resulting in disorder of function. So far, the small number of articles about clinical study of Chinese MPS IVA were published and only one paper about gene mutation analysis was published. This study aimed to investigate the mutation spectrum and characteristic of GALNS gene in Chinese patients with MPS IVA who were diagnosed in our hospital.Thirty-eight patients from 36 families (male 17, female 21) were diagnosed as MPS IVA by GALNS activity determination [(0.85 \u00b1 1.33) nmol/(17 h\u00b7mg)] and clinical symptoms during 2006-2012. The average age of diagnosis was (5.7 \u00b1 3.6) years. Mutation analysis of GALNS gene performed performed by PCR-direct DNA sequencing for 38 patients. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used for validating novel mutation, and also to assess amino acid conservation for novel missense variants in five different species. PolyPhen-2 tool was used to predict the possible impact of missense mutations on the structure and function of the human GALNS protein, etc. Analysis of GALNS activity and gene mutation in amniotic fluid were performed to provide the prenatal diagnosis for some families with MPS type IVA.(1) Thirty-eight kinds of mutation in GALNS gene were identified in 38 patients of them, 71% were missense mutations. p. M318R was a hot-spot mutation (21%) tested. Five kinds of mutation i.e., p. P163H, p.G168L, p. A324E, p. L366P and p. F452L were only found in Chinese patients with MPS IVA. Eighteen kinds of novel mutation were detected including p. E315K, p.G304D, p.R251Q, p.Y240C, p.G161E, p.N32D, p.L390P, p. D60E, p. P420S, W403C/T404S, p.L454P, for p.W405X, p. M1I, c.409_ c.420del12, c.1176_1178del3, c.1046delG, c.1188delG and IVS9-2A>C. (2) The polymorphism of novel missense variants were ruled out by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and no related mutations were found in 50 normal controls. A splice site mutation IVS9-2A>C had been validated by reverse transcription PCR direct sequencing. The amino acid of mutant position of 10 kinds of missense variants are highly conserved and only p. L454 is moderately conserved position. These missense variants were predicted to cause damage to the structure and function of human GALNS protein possibly according to the PolyPhen-2 tool, so these novel missense variants may be disease-causing mutations. (3) Prenatal diagnosis was provided for 7 families and three fetuses were diagnosed as MPS IVA.The GALNS gene mutation spectrum in Chinese patients with MPS IVA is really different from that in other countries, five kinds of mutation were only found in Chinese patients with MPS IVA. The reports of hot-spot mutation in Chinese patients were also different, and should be analyzed by more data of gene mutation analysis and epidemiological study.",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of enzyme replacement therapy and progress in bone marrow transplantation, treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is much more promising than ever. In order to benefit from these therapies, determination of the defective enzyme is the prerequisite for any individual patient. To make definite diagnosis for patients suspected of having MPS clinically, the authors established six lysosomal enzymatic assays for leucocytes, including alpha-L-iduronidase, iduronate-2-sulfatase, N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase, beta-galactosidase, arylsulfatase B, beta-glucuronidase, which are the corresponding enzymes of type I, type II, type IVA, type IVB, type VI, and type VII, respectively.Seventy patients suspected of having MPS were enrolled from outpatient clinics of the Department of Pediatric Endocrinologic, Genetic and Metabolic Diseases in Xinhua Hospital. Their ages spanned from 10 months to 25 years with the average age 5.7 years. Of them 49 were male and 21 were female. Leukocytes were isolated with Dextran from peripheral blood of suspected patients. Activity of leukocyte alpha-L-iduronidase, iduronate-2-sulfatase, N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase were measured using their specific artificial fluorescent substrates, while arylsulfatase B were determined by colorimetric assay with dipotassium 2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl sulfate as the substrate.Of the 70 clinically suspected cases totally 47 were confirmed of having mucopolysaccharidosis, of whom 7 cases were type I, 28 cases type II, 12 cases type IVA. These data show that type II is the predominant form of MPS in China, succeeded by MPS type IVA. It was also noted that type II has the most variable clinical manifestations and 8 out of 12 type IVA patients had the unique lax joints.The present study suggest that type II might be the predominant form of MPS cases in China, followed by type IVA and type I.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the values of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in etiologic diagnosis and understanding therapeutic effect in cerebral developmental retardation, and to help patients in early diagnosis, treatment and favorable prognosis.One hundred and fifty-eight childhood patients with brain heteroplasia were tested from July 2004 to October 2006. The blood was collected on filter paper, punched and extracted into methanol solution with stable isotope labeled internal standards, then derivatized with butanolic-HCl. After preparation, the samples were analysed by tandem mass spectrometry. Eleven MS/MS-positive patients were further analyzed based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of urine, clinical course, and treatment outcome.Eleven of 158 patients (7.0%) with inborn metabolic error were confirmed, including five with methylmalonic acidemia, two with propionic acidemia, one with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, one with maple syrup urine disease, one with phenylketonuria, and one with biotinidase deficiency. Among them, five were male, six were female, aged from 4 days to 21 months. The clinical manifestations were diverse, including mental developmental retardation or degradation (11 cases), convulsion (5 cases), coma (4 cases), vomiting (4 cases), malnutrition (4 cases), lethargy (3 cases), repeated infection (3 cases), hypotonia (2 cases), etc. Laboratory findings showed metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, hyperlactacidemia, anemia, etc. MRI findings of the brain showed cerebral atrophy, a pattern of bilateral T(2)W high signal intensity or/and T(1)W low signal intensity in cerebral white matter and multiple encephalomalacia or vesicular change, ect. In methylmalonic acidemia patients, the early onset with severe acidosis and coma have had a poor prognosis. Improvement was observed in 8 cases after treatment with vitamin B(12), L-carnitine, special milk, low-protein diet or biotin, etc. However 3 MMA patients died.MS/MS was helpful for some patients in etiologic diagnosis and understanding therapeutic effect of cerebral developmental retardation. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential to improve the prognosis and prevent brain damage.",

        "abstract": "The 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency is the most common type of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. The reported patients with BH4 deficiency are all PTPS deficient found in the mainland of China previously. The activity of dihydropteridine reductase in BH4 metabolism has been determined for 902 patients with hyperphenylalaninemia in the authors' laboratory since 2003. The purposes of this study were to characterize the first case with DHPR deficiency who was diagnosed in June, 2007, to investigate the clinical manifestation, the differential diagnostic criteria, the effect of treatment as well as gene mutation of DHPR deficiency.(1) A male patient presented with poor hand control, seizure, hypotonia and mental retardation since five-month after birth. His phenylalanine (Phe) level was 600 micromol/L and he was diagnosed as hyperphenylalaninemia at the age of one year and six-month. (2) This patient was subjected to combined Phe (100 mg/kg) and BH4 (20 mg/kg) loading test, to evaluate the degree of Phe level response to BH4. Urinary neopterin and biopterin analysis as well as the determination of DHPR activity in dried blood spot were also performed. (3) The blood DNA samples of the patient and his parents were collected to amplify the seven exons of QDPR gene using related primers, and the amplified products were directly sequenced for mutation analysis. (4) The patient was treated with BH4 or with a combined small amount of Phe-free special milk, neurotransmitter precursors and folic acid after the diagnosis and was followed up for clinical effects of treatment.(1) The basic Phe level was 476 micromol/L, then it increased to 1355 micromol/L at 3 h after taking Phe and slowly decreased to 610 micromol/L at 24h after taking BH4. (2) The basic urinary neopterin and biopterin were 2.92 mmol/mol Cr (normally < 2.61 mmol/mol Cr) and 7.44 mmol/molCr (normally < 2.67 mmol/mol Cr) respectively, and biopterin percentage was 71.79% (normally 42.7% - 75.9%). The patient had higher biopterin level. (3) The DHPR activity of this patient was (0.27 - 0.51) nmol/(min.5 mm disc) which were 6.11% - 10.6% of normal control, so he was diagnosed as DHPR deficiency. (4) The analysis of QDPR gene mutation showed that the patient carries missense mutation c.515C > T (P172L) from his father and nonsense mutation c.661C > T (R221X) from his mother. The c.515C > T is not reported before, we also did not find this mutation in 50 normal children. (5) The patient started to be treated with large dosage of BH4 (10 - 20) mg/(kg.d) or BH4 combined with small amounts of Phe-free milk, neurotransmitter precursors L-dopa (3 - 5) mg/(kg.d) plus carbidopa, 5-hydroxytryptophan (3 - 5) mg/(kg.d), and folic acid 15 mg/d as well at the age of one year and six-month after the diagnosis. The seizure has disappeared, the symptoms such as hypotonia have been obviously improved and the Phe level was 60 micromol/L at the six months after the treatment in this patient.(1) The patient with DHPR deficiency has common symptoms of BH4 deficiency (such as fair hair, hypotonia, mental retardation), and there is metabolic disturbance of folic acid in DHPR deficiency. (2) The higher Phe levels slowly decreased after BH4 loading test, the urinary biopterin level was very high and the DHPR activity was very low in the patient with DHPR deficiency. (3) The c.515C > T may be a new mutation of QDPR gene. (4) The DHPR deficient patient must be treated with higher dose of BH4 (8 - 20) mg/(kg.d), neurotransmitter precursors and folic acid as well.",

We investigated whether liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a more reliable and accurate method than MS/MS in the diagnosis and management of patients with MSUD in a Chinese population.A total of 370 dried blood spots (DBS) from healthy neonates, 44 DBS specimens from phenylketonuria neonates, and 38 DBS samples from 10 MSUD patients were retrospectively tested using the LC-MS/MS method. The results were compared with those obtained by the MS/MS method.The reference intervals of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and alloiosleucine (Allo-Ile) were estimated for both sexes. In classic MSUD patients, Allo-Ile was markedly elevated (average of 136 \u03bcmol/L, which was significantly higher than the normal value, <5 \u03bcmol/L). The averages of BCAAs were also markedly elevated continually during the treatment.The application of the LC-MS/MS method in the measurement of Allo-Ile and BCAAs in DBS is more useful for diagnosing and managing classic MSUD than the MS/MS method.",

The relationship between the genotype and phenotype was analyzed.Eighteen mutations were identified and the detection rate of gene mutation was 95.28%. Four hot-spot mutations, namely P87S (40.57%), N52S(13.21%), D96N(12.26%) and IVS1nt-291A to G(10.38%) were found in this study, and the first three were associated with severe phenotype. The P87L was reported firstly in Chinese patients, and the Q13X, M80T, IVS4nt-2A to G, L93M and K131N were novel mutations.The P87S, N52S, D96N and IVS1nt-291A to G mutations are the hot-spots mutations of the PTS gene in Chinese PTPSD patients. Using PCR-RFLP technique to screen the mutations in the PTS gene can increase the efficiency of gene diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II, MPS II) is a rare disease inherited in an X-linked autosomal recessive pattern. It is the prevailing form of the mucopolysaccharidoses in China. Here we investigated mutations of IDS (iduronate 2-sulfatase) gene in 38 unrelated Chinese patients, one of which is a female. Methods: Peripheral leucocytes were collected from the patients and the IDS gene was amplified to looking for the variations. For a female patient, the X chromosome status was analyzed by androgen receptor X-inactivation assay and the mutation impact on RNA level was further performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: We discovered that point mutations constituted the major form while mutations in codon p.R468 defined the largest number of patients in our cohort. Consistent with data from other ethnic groups, exons 9 and 3 had comparatively more mutations, while exon 2 had quite a few mutations unique to Chinese patients. Of the 30 different mutations identified, only 9 were novel: one was a premature termination mutation, i.e., c.196C>T (p.Gln66X); three were missense mutations, i.e., c.200T>C (p.Leu67Pro), c.215T>C (p.Leu72Pro), c.389C>T (p.Thr130Ile); one was a small deletion, i.e., c.1104_1122del19 (p.Ser369ArgfsX16); and one was a deletion that spanned both exons 8 and 9 deletion leading to gross structural changes in the IDS gene. In addition, a synonymous mutation c.879G>A (p.Gln293Gln) was identified in a female Hunter disease patient, which resulted in loss of the original splicing site, activated a cryptic splicing site upstream, leading to a 28 bp deletion and a premature termination at p. Tyr285GlufsX47. Together with concurrent skewed X-inactivation this was believed to facilitate the development of Hunter disease in this girl. Conclusions: In conclusion, the molecular analysis of IDS gene in Chinese patients confirmed the Hunter disease diagnosis and expanded the mutation and clinical spectrum of this devastating disorder. \u00a9 2011 Zhang et al.",

        "abstract": "The absence of a comprehensive analysis for phenylketonuria (PKU) mutations in the Chinese Han population has resulted in continued studies during the past 18 y to elucidate the mutational spectrum in patients from virtually all Chinese regions. Our study systematically investigated 13 exons and their surrounding introns of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in 212 unrelated patients using PCR and direct sequencing. A total of 79 different mutations were identified in 405 of 424 mutant PAH alleles including 15 novel ones. Eight mutations, R243Q, Ex6-96A>G, IVS4 - 1G>A, R413P, Y356X, R111X, R241C, and V399V, with a relative frequency of 3% or more, accounted for two thirds of the identified ones. The data presented in this study indicates that the total pool of mutant PAH alleles in China consisted of a small number of common mutations and a very high number of rare mutations. Moreover, by merging the findings of previous studies to generate a more composite data set for the Chinese mainland, it is shown that there are no significant differences of the common mutations between southern and northern except for R413P statistically, raising questions about the previous hypothesis that great variations on mutation frequencies exist between above regions.",

We aimed to identify PPD based on clinical manifestations and imaging analysis of the bony skeleton and then to investigate gene mutations of Wnt1-inducible signaling pathway protein 3 (WISP3) in Chinese patients with PPD. Seven patients (aged 9-49 years) from six unrelated Chinese families all presented with a waddling gait, progressive swelling and restricted joint movements, and all were diagnosed as having PPD according to clinical signs and symptoms, as well as radiographic imaging. The radiographic imaging revealed no erosive arthropathy, but showed platyspondyly, irregular or wedged/ovoid anterior end-plates of the vertebral bodies, coxa vara and widened epiphyses or metaphyses including the femoral head and the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Normal laboratory values were found for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and rheumatoid factors in all patients. Molecular studies revealed that five patients carried c.624_625insA/c.729_735delGAGAAAA, c.624_625insA/c.866_867insA, c.866_867 insA/c.866_867insA, Q46X/C114W and C223G/C114W mutations, respectively. In conclusion, our findings suggest that in order to avoid misdiagnosis, physicians should carefully examine the entire skeleton, including the spine, in addition to the skeletal extremities. Mutation analysis of the WISP3 gene is useful for confirming the clinical and radiographic diagnosis of PPD.",

Here we report a patient mainly presenting with hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and anemia. EEG examination revealed increased theta waves. Gaucher cells identified in his bone marrow and the highly elevated plasma chitotriosidase activity and glucosylsphingosine supported a diagnosis of Gaucher disease. However, the leukocyte \u03b2-glucosidase activity was in a normal range. Sanger sequencing revealed a novel maternal exonic mutation c.1133C>G (p.Pro378Arg) in exon 10 of the PSAP gene, which codes the Sap C domain of PSAP protein. To search for other underlying mutations in this patient, whole genome sequencing was applied and revealed a deletion involving exon 2 to 7 of PSAP gene. The deletion appears as a de novo event on paternal chromosome. We concluded that biallelic mutations of PSAP gene were the cause of this patient's Gaucher disease.

        "abstract": "To explore the clinical feature, therapeutic effect and prognosis of isolated methylmalonic acidemia.The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome of 40 patients were retrospectively analyzed. The main treatment was a low-protein diet supplemented with L-carnitine and special milk free of leucine, valine, threonine and methionine. Vitamin B12 was also given to cobalamin responders. The patients were followed up every 1-3 months.Mutations in the MUT gene were identified in 30 of 33 patients who had accepted DNA testing. Thirty cases were treated and followed up regularly for from 1 month to 8 years. Eight cases had died, 8 had developed normal intelligence, among whom 4 from newborn screening were asymptomatic. Psychomotor developmental delay and mental retardation were present in 14 cases. The propionylcarnitine level, ratio of propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine in blood, methylmalonic acid and methylcitric acid levels in urine have decreased significantly, with the median values reduced respectively from 24.15 (7.92-81.02) \u03bcmol/L, 1.08 (0.38-6.01), 705.34 (113.79-3078.60) and 7.71 (0.52-128.21) to 10.50 (3.00-30.92) \u03bcmol/L, 0.63 (0.25-2.89), 166.23 (22.40-3322.21) and 3.96 (0.94-119.13) (P < 0.05).The prognosis of isolated methylmalonic acidemia may be predicted with the enzymatic subgroup, age at onset and cobalamin responsiveness. Outcome is unfavorable in neonatal patients and those who were non-responsive to cobalamin.",

        "abstract": "To explore the clinical characteristics and the diagnostic method of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD).From January 2003 to December 2011, a total of 14 000 patients with suspected inherited metabolism diseases were tested. The blood levels of leucine and valine of these patients were detected by tandem mass spectrometry. The urinary level of branched-chain \u03b1-ketoacids was tested by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. And the diagnosis was based on the elevated levels of leucine and valine in blood and branched-chain \u03b1-ketoacids in urine.Thirty-three MSUD patients were confirmed. Their median age of initial visit was 0.17 years old (range: 7 days to 30 years old). The peak onset age of them was 2-30 days old, including 28 cases of neonatal onset (84.8%). The presenting symptoms of 28 cases were feeding difficulties (n=14), poor response, lethargy and seizures. Their median blood levels of leucine and valine (1901 (458-5804) and 600 (315-1617) \u00b5mol/L) were significantly higher than their normal levels ((50-300) and (60-250) \u00b5mol/L, both P<0.01). Their urinary levels of 2-OH-isovaleric acid, 2-keto-isovaleric acid, 2-keto-3-methylvaleric acid, 2-keto-isocaproic and acetylglycine (262.5 (5.4-624.3), 35.8 (1.9-156.0), 133.8 (7.4-611.5), 518.7 (17.2-2121.2) and 280.5 (11.0-1087.9) respectively) significantly higher than their normal levels (0, <0.1, 0, 0, <0.1 respectively, all P<0.01). In 5 intermittent MSUD patients, their blood levels of leucine and valine (402 (348-958) and 556 (322-808) \u00b5mol/L) were significantly higher than their normal levels (both P<0.01). The urinary level of 2-OH-isovaleric acid was significantly higher than its normal levels (P<0.01) while the urinary levels of other \u03b1-ketoacids were normal.The confirmation of MSUD remains difficult because of a lack of specific clinical features. The detections of tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry may aid its early diagnosis.",

MMA patients with a definite classification were divided into 2 groups: isolate MMA group (n = 51) and MMA complicated with homocysteinemia group (n = 65). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure the urine levels of methylmalonic acid and methylcitrate and tandem mass spectrometry to measure the blood levels of free carnitine (C0), acylcarnitines and methionine (Met).In the MMA group, the median levels of methylmalonic acid (259.10 (6.73 - 6429.28)), methylcitrate (4.39 (0 - 248.96)), C3 (8.52 (1.50 - 52.11) \u00b5mol/L) and C3/C2 (0.73(0.28 - 2.89)) were all higher than the upper limit values (0.2 - 3.6, 0 - 1.1, 0.50 - 4.00 \u00b5mol/L and 0.04 - 0.25 respectively). And they were all higher than those in the control group (0 (0 - 1.87), 0.10 (0 - 1.84), 1.40 (0.53 - 3.90) \u00b5mol/L, 0.10 (0.04 - 0.23), all P < 0.01). C3/C2 increased significantly in 15 patients while the C3 level remained normal. The median level of Met was normal in the isolate MMA group. But in patients with homocysteinemia, the level of 8.71 (0.68 - 31.95) \u00b5mol/L was below the reference value (10.00 - 35.00 \u00b5mol/L) and lower than that in the isolate MMA group (15.35 (4.18 - 59.50) \u00b5mol/L) and the control group (15.59 (10.20 - 34.68) \u00b5mol/L, all P < 0.05).Significant increases in the urine level of methylmalonic acid and C3/C2 may be specific to MMA. Organic acid analyses of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and acylcarnitines with tandem mass spectrometry are required for a definite diagnosis of this disorder. And repeated tests and genomic mutation analysis are necessary for patients with mildly abnormal biochemical indices.",

Capture sequencing was performed on genomic DNA from parents and probands using customized hybridization probes targeting highly heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms located within the 1\u2009M region flanking phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) and 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PTS) and its coding region to determine the parental haplotypes and linkage to pathogenic mutations. Maternal plasma DNA obtained at 12-20 weeks of gestation was also subjected to targeted sequencing to deduce the fetal haplotypes based on the parental haplotypes. The fetal genotypes were further validated by invasive prenatal diagnosis. Haplotype-based noninvasive prenatal testing was successfully performed in 13 families. Five fetuses were identified to harbor bi-allelic pathogenic variants of PAH, four fetuses were carriers of one heterozygous PAH variant, three fetuses were normal, and the fetus of the 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydrobiopterin synthase family was identified as normal. The fetal genotypes at two gestational weeks from the same PAH family were identical. All results were consistent with the prenatal diagnosis based on amniotic fluid. Haplotype-based noninvasive prenatal testing for HPA through targeted sequencing is accurate and feasible during early gestation.",

        "abstract": "The most common inborn error of cobalamin (cbl) metabolism in China is the cblC type characterized by combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia. The clinical presentation is relatively nonspecific, such as feeding difficulty, recurrent vomiting, hypotonia, lethargy, seizures, progressive developmental delay, and mental retardation, together with anemia and metabolic acidosis. More specific biochemical findings include high levels of propionylcarnitine (C3), free carnitine (C3/C0), and acetylcarnitine (C3/C2) measured by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), elevation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and increased total homocysteine with normal or decreased methionine. We report on 50 Chinese patients with combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia. Forty-six belonged to the cblC complementation group. Mutation analysis of the MMACHC gene was performed to characterize the mutational spectrum of cblC deficiency, and 17 different mutations were found. Most were clustered in exons 3 and 4, accounting for 91.3% of all mutant alleles. Two mutations were novel, namely, c.315 C>G (p.Y105X) and c.470 G>C(p.W157S). In terms of genotype-phenotype correlation, the c.609 G>A mutation was associated with early-onset disease when homozygous. Unlike previous reports from other populations, c.609 G>A (p.W203X) was the most frequent cblC mutation detected in our study of Chinese patients, affecting 51 of 92 MMACHC alleles (55.4%). The high prevalence of this nonsense mutation could have potential therapeutic significance for Chinese cblC patients. Besides traditional approaches consisting of hydroxocobalamin injections, carnitine, betaine, and protein restriction, novel drugs that target premature termination codons may have a role in the future.",

The growth, fracture incidence, physical activity, the quality of daily life and safety parameters were evaluated.All patients obtained marked improvement. The rates of bone fractures decreased more remarkably than that at pre-treatment (0 - 1.2 fractures per year vs 0.5 - 5.0 fractures per year, medium 0 vs 1.40 fractures per year) (P = 0.003). Their levels of physical activities improved significantly (median level from 4 to 3, P = 0.004). There was significant post-treatment improvement in the self-care activity scores (median score from 43 to 73, P = 0.003). The bone density of lumbar vertebrae, long bones and metaphysis improved at post-treatment. The radiographic examinations revealed the thickness of bone cortex. The change in height did not show any significant difference. No change was found in the serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphate or other biochemical markers. No adverse reaction occurred throughout treatment.Oral alendronate treatment reduces the incidence of bone fracture and improves physical activity and life quality in OI children, and as a well-tolerated regimen, it is both safe and effective in clinical practice.",

The identified mutations in the parents of the patients and 50 normal controls were screened by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct DNA sequencing.Total detection rate of gene mutation is 100% in the 12 children with MCD. Six mutations were detected in the 4 children with BT deficiency, they were c. 98-104del7ins3, c. 1369G>A (V457M), c. 1157G>A(W386X), c. 1284C>A(Y428X), c. 1384delA and c. 1493_1494insT. The last four were novel mutations. Four mutations were found in the 8 children with HLCS deficiency. They were c. 126G>T (E42D), c. 1994G>C (R665P), c. 1088T>A (V363D) and c. 1522C>T (R508W). The last two were hot-spot mutations [75%(12/16)], and c. 1994G>C (R665P) was a novel mutation.This study confirmed the diagnosis of 12 patients with MCD on the gene level. Six mutations were found in the BT gene and 4 in the HLCS gene, including 5 novel mutations. Two mutations of the HLCS gene are probably hot-spot mutations in Chinese children with HLCS deficiency.",

All patients were performed by phenylalanine (Phe) and BH4 loading test, urinary pterin analysis and dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity. Some patients received the dopa treatment for diagnosis of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). The analysis of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 gene (GCH1) mutation for DRD patients and the analysis of 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (PTS) gene mutations for PTS deficient patients were done under the consent from their parents.Seventy of 100 patients had normal basic blood Phe levels, six (6%) patients were diagnosed as DRD. Thirty patients had hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), eight (8%) were diagnosed as PTS deficiency and 22(22%) were diagnosed as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. All patients had normal DHPR activity. The mutation IVS5+3insT of GCH1 was found in 2 patients with DRD. Seven kinds of PTS mutations were found in 8 patients with PTS deficiency, and 75% of the mutations were 259C-->T,286G-->A and 155A-->G.Some patients with unknown motor disturbance and mental retardation may suffer from BH4 metabolism related diseases. Theses patients are necessary to be screened for such kind of diseases in order to confirm the diagnosis.",

Urinary organic acids were analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Gene mutation and protein function analysis were performed by PCR direct sequencing and PolyPhen-2 software.Higher blood C5-OH concentrations (5.11-21.77 \u03bcmol/L) and abnormal 3-hydroxy isovalerate and 3-methylcrotonyl glycine in urine were detected in the five asymptomatic mothers, who were diagnosed as benign MCCD. Higher C5-OH concentration was also detected in their neonates by tandem mass spectrometry, which had gradually decreased to normal levels in three neonates. Four new variations, i.e., c.ins1680A(25%), c.203C > T (p.A68V), c.572T > C (p.L191P) and c.639+5G > T were detected in the MCCC1 gene, in addition with 2 mutations [c.1406G > T (p.R469L, novel variation) and c.592C > T (p.Q198X)]. The novel variations were predicted to have affected protein structure and function.For neonates with higher C5-OH concentration detected upon neonatal screening, their mothers should be also tested to rule out MCCD.

The frequencies of R413P S411X R408W R408Q mutation were 2.76%, 0.39%, 0.39% and 0.39%, respectively. The S411X mutation in Chinese was first reported. Only 2 cases with R413P mutation were detected by SSCP. DGGE analysis showed that 10 cases displayed 3 kinds of abnormal electrophoretic bands. There were no obvious differences in the frequency of R413P mutation between northern and southern Chinese with PKU, and between classical PKU and hyperphenylalaninemia.DGGE is more sensitive than SSCP in screening the mutations of exon 12 of the PAH gene. DGGE combined with DNA sequencing can be used to define all the mutations of exon 12 of the PAH gene. These results indicate the similarity in the frequency of R413P mutation between northern and southern patients.",

        "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU), caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene variants, is a common autosomal inherited metabolic disease. So far, 1111 PAH variants have been revealed. The residual activity of the PAH variants is the key determinant of the metabolic phenotype and BH responsiveness in PKU patients. In this study, the spectrum of PAH variants in 1083 Chinese PKU patients was analyzed. Then 20 variants (p.L52F, p.R86P, p.L128P, p.L142P, p.D163N, p.C203G, p.E214G, p.F260L, p.M276T, p.L311R, p.P314A, p.L364F, p.Q375H, p.F382I, p.A395S, p.V412D, p.E108*, p.C203*, p.C284* and p.E353*) were expressed in COS-7 cells. The residual activities and protein expression levels were detected by isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) and Western blotting, respectively. We compared the results of the phenotypic prediction based on APV and PAH activity respectively, and further explored the relationship between residual activity and phenotype in PKU patients. We reported 9 newly discovered PAH variants for the first time, thereby expanding the spectrum of PAH variants. Among the 20 variants in our assay, 8 variants showed mild impaired residual activities (48-92%) and approximately normal protein expression levels compared to the wild-type PAH. In contrast, 9 variants showed severely impaired residual activities (0-34%) and reduced protein expression. However, three variants (p.L52F, p.F260L and p.P314A) showed impaired residual activities (5%, 32% and 29%), although the proteins were well expressed. We assigned APV scores for 14 variants, in which the results of the phenotypic prediction were consistent for 12/14 (86%) variants based on APV and residual activity respectively, and the residual activity correctly predicted 17/22 (77%) of the patients. Our study helped to further understand the genotype-phenotype correlation in PKU patients.",

With the diagnosis established, the FAH gene was analyzed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing.Two patients had acute onset of the disease, while another had subacute onset of the disease, with features including hepatomegaly and remarkably increased tyrosine and succinylacetone in the blood. Five mutations were detected in the FAH gene, which included c.455G>A (W152X), c.520C>T (R174X), c.974_976delCGAinsGC, c.1027 G>A (G343R) and c.1100 G>A (W367X), among which c.455G>A (W152X), c.974_976delCGAinsGC and c.1100 G>A (W367X) were not reported previously.Tyrosinemia type I may be effectively diagnosed with the level of tyrosine and succinylacetone by tandem mass spectrometry and succinylacetone in the urine by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Detection of underlying mutations mutations will be helpful for genetic counseling and further research.",

At the same time, 18,284,745 newborns had also been tested for CH, with 8918 cases being detected (1:2050). It is remarkable that the mean number of newborns screened per year had increased 5 times between 2000 and 2007. In Shanghai, 116,000 newborns were screened using tandem mass spectrometry and 6 different were detected. The overall prevalence of an inborn errors of metabolism identified was 1 in 5800 healthy newborns, with hyperphenylalaninemia being the most common.

        "abstract": "To investigate the MUT gene mutations in patients with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), and analyze the genotype-phenotype correlation in patients with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency.The diagnosis of the disease mainly depends on the measurement of C3 (acylcarnitine), C3/C0 (free carnitine) and C3/C2 (acetylcarnitine) in the blood by tandem mass spectrometry, the detection of methylmalonic acid in the urine by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry, the determination of total homocysteine in the serum, and the loading test of vitamin B(12). The entire coding region of the MUT gene was screened by PCR combined with direct DNA sequencing in 21 isolated MMA patients. Novel mutations were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analysis in 100 controls.Seventeen MUT gene mutations were detected in 14 of the 21 patients, among them 8 mutations were novel, and R108H, D244LfsX39 and G544X were more frequent, with the frequencies of 9.5%, 7.1% and 9.5%, respectively. Most mutations were missense mutations (64.7%), and majority of them were in exons 2 and 3 (55.6%). Ten out of the 14 patients with MUT gene mutations had early-onset disease, while one case had late-onset disease, and the remaining 3 cases were detected by newborn screening. In addition, 11 of these 14 patients did not respond to vitamin B(12).This study revealed partial MUT gene mutation spectrum in Chinese patients with isolated MMA. The patients carrying MUT mutations often had early-onset disease, and most of them were VitB(12)- non-responsive.",

The coding regions of GAA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by direct DNA sequencing.The proband and the fetus had low GAA activity (12.3% and 1.1% of the average normal range, respectively). Mutation analysis of the GAA gene revealed a novel nonsense mutation p.W738X and a reported nonsense mutation p.E888X in both the proband and the fetus; the reported pseudodeficiency allele c.[1726G to A: 2065G to A] was found in the proband, the mother and the fetus.The proband and the fetus were both GSD II affected. A combination of GAA activity analysis and mutation analysis is efficient for the prenatal diagnosis of GSD II. Mutation analysis should be a routine method in the prenatal diagnosis of GSD II in Asian population, where pseudodeficiency allele can cause low GAA activity in normal individuals which is relatively common in Asian.",

Recently, microarray analysis has become a useful new technique for mutation analysis. We developed a GSD Ia microarray capable of identifying known mutations in the G6PC gene and validate the feasibility of using it as a rapid detection method for DNA-based diagnosis.An approach based on universal DNA microarray (UA) and ligase detection reaction (LDR) was used. Fifteen mutations and one polymorphism were detected in this microarray. A total of 102 DNA samples from GSD Ia patients were tested.The genotypes obtained using the DNA microarray were in full agreement with those obtained by direct sequencing. For each mutation, wild-type homozygote, heterozygote, and mutant-type homozygote were typed correctly into three groups.The shortened assay time and high specificity validated by 102 GSD Ia patients suggest that the GSD Ia microarray has the potential to become an efficient, rapid detection method for DNA-based diagnosis and carrier detection.",

These patients, 63 males and 45 females, were at a mean age of 7.05 months. A combined phenylalanine (Phe) and BH4 loading test was carried out in the patients who had a basic blood Phe concentration less than 600 micromol/L. The urine pterine profile analysis and the dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity in dry blood filter spot were analyzed simultaneously. (2)BH4 responsive patients were divided to southern and northern groups by their parent's native place and geographic boundary determined by Changjiang River. The change of Phe concentration after BH4 loading test was compared between the two groups.(1)Among the 108 HPA cases, 36 patients (33.3%) were BH4 responsive PAH deficiency, 49 (45.4%) were non-BH4 no responsive phenylketonuria (PKU)and 23(21.3%)were BH4 deficiency (BH4D). The Phe concentration of patients with BH4 responsive PAH deficiency decreased by 49.24% and 65.35% at 8 h and 24 h after oral BH4, 23 in southern group and 13 in northern group among 36 patients. (2)The mean Phe concentration at 24 h after loading test in southern and northern groups were (217.02+/-189.03) micromol/L and 458.75+/-342.54 micromol/L respectively (P<0.05), although the decrease percent of plasma Phe concentration at 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h was no distinct difference between southern and northern groups (P>0.05).Most of mild and moderate HPA patients affected by PAH deficiency show plasma Phe concentration decrease >30% in 24 h after oral BH4 20 mg/kg, few are classic PKU. The responsiveness to BH4 is no difference between southern and northern Chinese patients with BH4 responsive PAH deficiency according to the decrease percent of plasma Phe concentration, although the Phe concentration is lower in southern patients than that in northern patients.",

It belongs to the family of disorders of the nucleotide excision repair system. Mutations of the ERCC6 and ERCC8 genes are the predominant cause of the Cockayne syndrome, whereby the ERCC6 gene mutation makes up approximately 70% of the cases. We report a Chinese case of a classic Cockayne syndrome, carrying the novel nonsense mutation c.1387C>T/Q463X in the ERCC6 gene in an apparently homozygous status. This mutation was found in a heterozygous status in this patient's father, while the mother carried two wild-type ERCC6 alleles. A further molecular investigation of the family revealed that there was a de novo microdeletion including the ERCC6 gene of maternal origin in the proband. The determination of the deletion breakpoints by Illumina genome-wide DNA analysis beadchip showed that the deletion spanned 2.82 Mb in size. This case adds to the mutation spectrum of this DNA repair disorder.",

Segments bearing novel mutations were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.Within the variant alleles, 28 mutations (28/32, 87.5%), were detected in 15 patients, while one patient displayed no mutations. Mutations were comprised of 20 different: 6 BCKDHA gene mutations in 4 cases, 10 BCKDHB gene mutations in 8 cases and 4 DBT gene mutations in 3 cases. From these, 14 were novel, which included 3 mutations in the BCKDHA gene, 7 in the BCKDHB gene and 4 in the DBT gene. Only two patients with mutations in the BCKDHB and DBT genes were thiamine-responsive and presented a better clinical outcome.We identified 20 different mutations within the BCKDHA, BCKDHB and DBT genes among 16 Chinese MSUD patients, including 14 novel mutations. The majority were non-responsive to thiamine, associating with a worse clinical outcome. Our data provide the basis for further genotype-phenotype correlation studies in these patients, which will be beneficial for early diagnosis and in directing the approach to clinical intervention.",

        "abstract": "National coverage of neonatal screening for hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in China is still low and tests to differentiate causes of HPA are not performed in many centres. This study aimed to describe the demographics, geographic distribution, diagnosis, treatment and clinical outcomes of treatment, including intellectual development, in patients with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency in mainland China.This was a retrospective, multicentre, chart review in patients with BH4 deficiency across mainland China born 1985-2010.Two hundred fifty six patients were included; 59.9 % (267/446) of parents were from eastern China. Median (interquartile range) age at diagnosis decreased from 12.0 (5.5, 102.0) months to 2.0 (1.0, 3.5) months in patients born 1985-1999 (n\u2009=\u200928) and 2005-2010 (n\u2009=\u2009152), respectively. 6-Pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency was the primary cause of BH4 deficiency (96.0 %); four hotspot mutations accounted for 76.6 % of PTS gene mutations; two novel variants in the QDPR gene were identified. Most patients (83.6 %) received treatment with BH4, L-dopa, 5-hydroxytryptophan and/or diet therapy. Target blood Phe concentration was confirmed at 88.9 % of visits; median (Q1, Q3) blood Phe concentration was 106.8 (73.0, 120.0) \u03bcmol/L during therapy and 117.0 (67.1, 120.0) \u03bcmol/L at last visit. Median (Q1, Q3) WISC IQ score was 80.0 (69.0, 90.0) in 33 patients. DQ scores were within normal range (\u226585) for 37/59 (62.7 %) patients. Physical development indicators were within normal ranges. Treatment-related adverse events, reported in 20/256 (7.8 %) patients, were mild-to-moderate in severity.This study provides valuable information on the current and historical situation of BH4 deficiency in mainland China.",

Novel mutations were analyzed by aligning GLB1 homologs, 100 control chromosomes, and the PolyPhen-2 tool.The enzymatic activity of GLB1 was found to be 5.03, 4.20, and 4.50 nmol/h/mg in the three patients, respectively. Patient 1 was a compound heterozygote for p.[Arg148Cys] and p.[Tyr485Cys] mutations in the GLB1 gene. Patient 2 was a compound heterozygote for p.[Tyr270Phe] and p.[Leu337Pro] mutations. Patient 3 was a homozygote for p.[Asp448Val] mutation. Three mutations (p.[Tyr485Cys], p.[Tyr270Phe] and p.[Leu337Pro]) were novel variants and were predicted to damage GLB1 function.The enzymatic activity and related gene analysis of \u03b2-galactosidase should be performed in clinically suspected individuals to confirm diagnosis.

        "abstract": "To investigate the clinical and laboratory features of neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) and to characterize the molecular basis and prognosis of this disease.Twenty-six patients with NICCD were collected because of idiopathic intrahepatic cholestasis and jaundice. The diagnosis was made by routine laboratory data collection, tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. SLC25A13 gene mutation was analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. The patients were followed up for nearly 2 years.The NICCD patients showed low birth weight and the average onset of jaundice was 29 days. Laboratory data showed liver dysfunction, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoproteinemia, high levels of alpha-fetoprotein, prolonged prothrombin time, hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia. MS-MS analysis of the blood samples revealed specific elevation of citrulline, methionine, threonine, tyrosine and elevation of free carnitine, short-chain and long-chain acylcarnitines. GC-MS analysis of the urine samples showed elevated 4-hydroxyl phenyllactic acid and 4-hydroxyl phenylpyruvic acid. Twelve different mutations were identified, including 4 novel mutations, i.e., G386V, R467X, K453R and 1192-1193delT. Forty-four mutated alleles were identified in the 52 alleles (84.6% ). Among them, 851del4, 1638ins23 and IVS6+5G>A mutations were the most frequent mutations, accounting for 40.9%, 20.5% and 11.4% of the total alleles examined respectively. Five of the 26 patients have not been recovered, including 4 died and 1 accepted liver transplantation. No obvious relationship was found between the genotype and phenotype in NICCD.The 851del4, 1638ins23 and IVS6+5G>A mutations are the hot-spot mutations in Chinese NICCD patients. Some NICCD patients have poor prognosis.",

        "abstract": "The value of genotyping to predict variant phenotypes in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase (Pah) deficiency is a matter of debate. However, there exists no comprehensive population relationship study focused on the Han Chinese.We analyzed genotype-phenotype correlation for 186 different genotypes in 338 unrelated Chinese patients harboring 109 different Pah mutations. Two systems were used in this process. The first was a phenotype prediction system based on arbitrary values (AV) attributed to each mutation. The second was a pair-wise correlation analysis. The observed phenotype for AV analysis was the corresponding metabolic phenotype stratified according to the pretreatment phenylalanine (Phe) value.We found that the observed phenotype matched the predicted phenotype in 54.41% of 272 patients for whom AV information was available; the highest degree of concordance (61.83%) was found in patients with null/null genotypes, whereas the lowest \"concordance rate\" (32.69%) was observed for patients with expected mild-PKU phenotype. There are repeated inconsistencies for such mutations as R241C, R243Q, R261Q, V388M, V399V, R408Q, A434D and EX6-96A>G which are associated with variable phenotypes in patients with identical genotype. Significant correlations were disclosed between pretreatment Phe values and predicted residual activity (r=-0.45643, P<0.0001) or AV sum (r=-0.59523, P<0.0001).Our study supports the notion that the Pah mutation genotype is the main determinant of metabolic phenotype in most patients in a particular population, and provided novel insights into the values that underpin the subsequent treatment and the prognosis of PKU in Chinese.",

The second aim was to investigate the mutation spectrum of MCC gene in Chinese population and hotspot mutation.Forty-two cases (male 33, female 9) , who had higher blood 3-hydroxy-isovalerylcarnitine (C5-OH) levels(cut-off <0.6 \u00b5mol/L) detected by neonatal screening using MS/MS, were recruited to this study during Sept.2011 to Mar.2013. The C5-OH concentrations were [0.84 (0.61-20.15) \u00b5mol/L] in 42 cases at the screening recall. Five cases were firstly diagnosed as maternal MCCD, 6 cases as benign MCCD and 31 cases were suspected as MCCD. To follow up the height, weight, mental development, blood C5-OH concentrations and urinary 3-methylcrotonyl-glycine (3-MCG) and 3-hydroxy isovalerate (3-HIVA) in order to investigate the clinical outcome. The MCCC1 and MCCC2 gene mutation were analyzed for some cases. The novel gene variants were evaluated, and the influence of novel missense variants on the protein structure and function were predicted by PolyPhen-2, SIFT, UniProt and PDB software.(1) Forty-two cases had no symptoms, their physical and mental development were normal in the last visit at the median ages of 29 months, the oldest age of follow up was nearly 9 years. (2) Gene mutation analysis was performed for 29 cases with informed consent signed by parents.Fourteen different mutations were identified in 19 cases. The mutations in MCCC1 gene accounted for 86%, the most common mutation was c.ins1680A, (accounted for 40%). Nine kinds of novel variant were detected including 211AG>CC/p.Q74P, c.295G>A/p.G99S, c.764A>C/p.H255P, c.964G>A/p. E322K, c.1331G>A/p.R444H, c.1124delT, c.39_58del20, c.1518delG, c.639+2T>A.Other 3 kinds of mutation in MCCC1 gene and 2 kinds of mutation in MCCC2 gene have been reported previously; the amino acid of mutant positions of five kinds of novel missense variant are almost highly conserved. These missense variants were predicted to cause change of human MCC protein side chain structure by changing hydrogen bonding, size of amino acid residue and electric charge, and predicted to damage the protein function possibly according to PolyPhen-2 and PDB analysis. So these novel variants may be disease-causing mutations. No mutation were detected in 10 cases. (3) Blood concentrations of C5-OH when screening, recall and end of follow-up in maternal MCCD was 3.50 (1.63-11.43), 1.84 (1.00-9.30), 0.27 (0.26-5.81) \u00b5mol/L. There was a significant downward trend.In contrast, benign MCCD group was 8.20 (3.60-9.60), 9.67 (3.88-20.15), 23.0 (5.87-49.10) \u00b5mol/L.It showed a rising trend. Children's urinary 3-MCG of benign MCCD group was found abnormally elevated in 4 cases (100%) when they were recalled.A certain number of cases with MCCD or suspected as MCCD in this study had no symptoms and normal physical and mental development after follow-up to oldest age of nearly 9 years. The mutation in MCCC1 gene is common, nine novel mutations were found, c.ins1680A may be a hotspot mutation in Chinese population. The urinary GC/MS analysis and blood MS/MS analysis for mother should be routinely performed for all cases with high blood C5-OH level detected by neonatal screening.",

All exons and the intron-exon boundaries of guanosine triphosphate hydroxylase I gene, tyrosine hydroxylase gene and sepiapterin reductase gene were examined by DNA-PCR, bi-directional sequencing.The patient was a 3-year-old boy, presented with unexplained dystonia for 3 years, without significant impairment of intelligence. Physical examination showed limb muscle strength grade V, rigidity of extremities, hypertonicity, brisk deep tendon reflexes in limbs, without obvious abnormalities in auxiliary examination, such as brain MRI, hepatic biochemical panel, creatine kinase, and ceruloplasmin. He dramatically responded to small doses of levodopa in the follow-up for half a year. A homozygous missense change in exon 5 of TH gene, c.605G > A (p.R202H), which was a known pathogenic mutation, was found in the patient. His parents were heterozygous for the R202H mutation.The age of onset in tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency patients is usually within the first year of life. Unexplained dystonia and hypokinesia were the main clinical features of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. The dopa-responsive effects for some patients are so obvious that we should strengthen awareness of the disease. TH gene c.605G > A (p.R202H) may be a common type of causative mutations for the mild form at home and abroad.",

We hypothesized that the oxidation product of cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC), might increase in the plasma of patients with ASMase-deficient NPD. In this study, a rapid and nonderivatized method of measurement of plasma 7-KC by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed. Plasma samples from healthy subjects, patients with ASMase-deficient NPD, nonaffected ASMase-deficient NPD heterozygotes, Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, glycogen storage disorder type II (GSDII), Gaucher disease (GD), mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPSII), Krabbe disease (KD), and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) were tested retrospectively. Markedly elevated 7-KC was found in patients with ASMase-deficient NPD and NPC disease that showed significant differences from ASMase-deficient NPD heterozygotes; patients with GSDII, GD, MPSII, KD, and MLD; and normal controls. The analysis of plasma 7-KC by LC-MS/MS offers the first simple, quantitative, and highly sensitive method for detection of ASMase-deficient NPD and could be useful in the diagnosis of both ASMase-deficient NPD and NPC disease.",

        "abstract": "Information concerning inherited metabolic diseases in China is scarce. We investigated the prevalence and age distributions of amino acid, organic acid, and fatty acid oxidation disorders in Chinese patients.Blood levels of amino acids and acylcarnitines (tandem mass spectrometry) were measured in 18,303 patients with suspected inherited metabolic diseases. Diagnosis was based on clinical features, blood levels of amino acids or acylcarnitines, urinary organic acid levels (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), and (in some) gene mutation tests.Inherited metabolic diseases were confirmed in 1,135 patients (739 males, 396 females). Median age was 12 months (1 day to 59 years). There were 28 diseases: 12 amino acid disorders (580 patients, 51.1%), with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) being the most common; nine organic acidemias (408 patients, 35.9%), with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) as the most common; and seven fatty acid oxidation defects (147 patients, 13.0%), with multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) being the most common. Onset was mainly at 1-6 months for citrin deficiency, 0-6 months for MMA, and in newborns for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD). HPA was common in patients aged 1-3 years, and MADD was common in patients >18 years.In China, HPA, citrin deficiency, MMA, and MADD are the most common inherited disorders, particularly in newborns/infants.",

Further combined loading tests with phenylalanine (Phe) (100 mg/kg) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (7.5 mg/kg) were performed in suspected patients with abnormal urinary pterin profiles. Gene mutation analysis was performed for patients with BH4 deficiency and their parents. BH4 deficient patients were treated with BH4 and neurotransmitter precursors after diagnosis. Blood phenylalanine levels, clinical symptoms and mental development were followed up.Eleven patients were diagnosed as having BH4 deficiency caused by 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency. The incidence of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency among patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) in southern Chinese was 10%. Combined loading tests with phenylalanine and oral BH4 were done in 4 of 11 patients and their phenylalanine levels were decreased to normal 4 - 6h after BH4 administration. Four different mutations (P87S, N52S, D96N and G144R) in the PTPS gene were detected in 5 families. Five PTPS-deficient patients were treated with synthetic BH4, neurotransmitter precursors (L-dopa plus carbidopa, and 5-hydroxytryptophan). They had satisfactory physical and mental development after treatment. One patient with partial PTPS deficiency had normal growth and mental development without treatment.Our results emphasize that screening for BH4 deficiency should be carried out in all patients with hyperphenylalaninemia in order to minimize the misdiagnosis. Patients with BH4 deficiency should be treated early with BH4 and a combination of neurotransmitter precursors.",

Their peripheral blood specimens were collected after obtaining informed consent. All exons and the intron-exon boundaries of NPC1 gene were examined by bi-directional sequencing.Three patients, 1 female and 2 males, aged from 2 months to 5 years and 10 months, all first complained of jaundice in the neonatal period. Laboratory tests showed total bilirubin and direct bilirubin significantly increased with predominant increase of direct bilirubin. Total bile acid, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were also increased, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased. All patients were also accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly, with two of them having increased bronchovascular markings in chest X-ray. Two heterozygous changes of NPC1 gene, c.2741G>T +c.3020C>G (p. C914F + p. P1007R), c.2177G>C + c.3734_ 3735delCT (p.R726T + p. P1245RfsX12), and c.2054T>C + c.2128C>T(p.I685T + p.Q710X), were identified in patient 1, 2 and 3, respectively.We reported three cases suffered from Niemann-Pick disease type C with initial presentation as neonatal cholestasis in the mainland of China. For newborns with prolonged jaundice in the neonatal period, as well as neonatal cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, Niemann-Pick type C should be included in consideration of differential diagnosis. Genetic testing can identify causative mutations for diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Systemic primary carnitine deficiency (CDSP) is caused by mutations in SLC22A5 gene, which encodes organic cation transporter 2(OCTN2). CDSP leads to skeletal or cardiac myopathy and hepatic encephalopathy. The present study aimed to identify SLC22A5 gene mutations and analyze the potential relationship between genotype and clinical symptoms in 20 Chinese patients with CDSP. The complete coding region of the SLC22A5 gene including intron-exon boundaries were amplified and sequenced in all patients. Eighteen different mutations were found; of which, nine were novel. The mutations clustering in exons 1 and 4 accounted for 66.7% of all mutant alleles (26/39). The c.760C>T (p. R254X) was the most frequent mutation (25.6%, 10/39), suggesting it as an ethnic founder mutation. The relationship between genotype and phenotype was investigated in patients carrying the R254X mutation. Homozygous patients with R254X were late-onset cases who presented with dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness after 1 year of age. Compound heterozygous patients carrying R254X, combined with other missense mutations occurred in very specific positions, dramatically altered OCTN2 protein function. Based on the analysis of case studies, a clear relationship between free carnitine (C0) level in plasma and OCTN2 genotype was not found in the present work, however, the low plasma C0 level could not indicate disease severity or genotype. Further functional studies with a large sample size are required to understand the relationship between R254X mutation and CDSP.",

Mutations in FBN1 gene have been identified in AD, GD and WMS patients. By targeted next-generation sequencing of skeletal dysplasia-related genes, including FBN1 and ADAMTSL2, three novel missense mutations, c.5189A>T (p.N1730I), c.5198G>T (p.C1733F), c.5243G>T (p.C1748F), and one known mutation c.5198G>A (p.C1733Y) of FBN1 gene were identified in four probands, respectively. Clinically, p.C1733Y was associated with GD, as reported previously, as well as the novel p.N1730I, whereas p.C1733F and p.C1748F were associated with AD and WMS. Interestingly, different mutations at the same codon (p.C1733Y and p.C1733F) were associated with different phenotypes (GD and AD, respectively). However, the mutations p.C1748F and p.C1748R were associated with WMS. Our data support the importance of TGF\u03b2-binding protein-like domain 5 of FBN1 protein in pathogenicity of acromelic dysplasia, and expands the genotype/phenotype relations of these rare forms of fibrilliopathies.",

        "abstract": "Methyl malonic academia (MMA) is characterized by abnormal accumulation of methyl malonic acid in body fluids. Patients usually have a variety of clinical symptoms including recurrent vomiting, metabolic acidosis, developmental delay, seizure, or death. However, a few cases where the patients have no symptom are also reported. Here, we conducted clinical, biochemical, and molecular analysis of eight Chinese patients identified through newborn screening between 2003 and 2013. All the patients had significantly higher blood propionylcarnitine (C3) concentrations, ratio of propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine (C3/C2); and their urine methyl malonic acid and methylcitric acid (MCA) excretions were remarkably higher than normal at diagnosis and during follow-ups. In addition, five different known mutations were identified in seven of the eight patients in either MUT or MMACHC. All these mutations were expected to produce defective proteins that would result in decreased or even total loss of methyl malonyl-CoA mutase activity. However, normal outcomes were found in all patients in physical growth, intellectual performance and cerebral MRI analysis at diagnosis (range, 14-53 days) and during follow-ups (range, 1.8-10 years). Our study is the first report of Chinese MMA patients with increased secretion of methyl malonic acid and molecular defects in MUT or MMACHC yet remain asymptomatic. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Clinical observations and molecular analysis of the SMPD1 gene in Chinese patients with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) are scarce.A cohort of 27 Chinese patients diagnosed with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, within the past five years, were collected and investigated for genotype, phenotype, and their correlations.The majority of our patients (25/27) were under 18 years of age. From the cohort group, eight (30%) fulfilled characters of type A. Four other patients experienced neurologic involvement after two years of age, these were classified as intermediate type. The remaining fifteen presented without clear neurologic involvement and were regarded as type B. One patient, from the type B group, presented with the unusual symptom of a secondary amenorrhea. Three patients, one from the type B group and two from the intermediate group, presented with pronounced proteinuria, in the late stages of the disease, indicating possible kidney involvement in NPD. Twenty-four SMPD1 gene mutations had been identified; eighteen of these are novel ones. These included four exonic small deletions/duplications (c.4delC, c.147_150del4, c.842-849dup8, c.1307-1312dup6), one termination mutation (p.Glu248X), and thirteen exonic point mutations (p.Gly336Ser, p.Trp342Cys, p.Leu382Phe, p.Pro429Leu, p.Pro430Ser, p.Trp437Arg, p.Thr451Pro, p.His461Pro, p.Ala484Val, p.Ser486Arg, p.Tyr500His, p.Pro533Leu, p.Val559Leu). Notably, eight mutations had more than one occurrence with c.4delC and p.Glu248X accounting for ~30% of all alleles. Correlation analysis of genotype and phenotype indicated eight mutations, c.842-849dup8, p.Glu248X, p.Arg230Cys, p.Trp437Arg, p.His461Pro, p.Ala484Val p.Ser486Arg, and p.Pro533Leu,to be severe mutations. Five mutations, c.4delC, p.Leu382Phe, p.Pro429Leu, p.Pro430Ser and p.Val559Leu were projected to be mild mutations. Interestingly, three intermediate individuals carried combinations of a mild mutation, c.4delC, on one allele and a severe mutation on the other allele.The Chinese population may have a comparably high incidence of sphingomyelinase-deficient Niemann-Pick disease type A. This study has identified some novel genotype and phenotype correlations in this rare and devastating disorder.",

        "abstract": "It has been reported that oxidation product of cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, increases in plasma of patients with NP-C. Previously, we established a rapid test to determine the plasma 7-ketocholesterol level and found it elevated significantly in patients with acid sphingomyelinase deficient NPD and NP-C disease.Individuals randomly referred to our outpatient clinics in the past two years for hepatosplenomegaly or isolated splenomegaly, who have been excluded as acid sphingomyelinase deficient NPD or Gaucher disease, and individuals with newborn cholestasis, psychomotor regression/retardation, were screened for plasma 7-ketocholesterol level. Individuals with high 7-ketocholesterol level were then analyzed for NPC1 and NPC2 gene mutation to confirm the accuracy of NP-C diagnosis.By screening the plasma 7-ketocholesterol of suspect individuals, 12 out of 302 (4%) had shown remarkable high levels compared with reference. All these twelve individuals were subsequently confirmed to be NP-C by DNA analysis of NPC1 and NPC2 genes, with the early infantile form (n\u2009=\u20097), the late infantile form (n\u2009=\u20091), the juvenile form (n\u2009=\u20091) and the adult form (n\u2009=\u20091). Furthermore, two NP-C patients without observable neuropsychiatric disability were picked up through this procedure. Only one patient had NP-C due to NPC2 gene mutations, with the rest due to NPC1 gene mutations. We found that in NP-C patients AST was usually mildly elevated and ALT was in a normal range when jaundice was not present. In total, 22 mutant alleles were identified in the NPC1 gene, including six novel small deletions/insertions, e.g., c.416_417insC, c.1030delT, c.1800delC, c.2230_2231delGT, c.2302_2303insG, and c.2795dupA; seven novel exonic point mutations, c.1502A>T (p.D501V), c.1553G>A (p.R518Q), c.1832A>G (p.D611G), c.2054T>C (p.I685T), c.2128C>T(p.Q710X), c.2177G>C (p.R726T), c.2366G>A (p.R789H), and one novel intronic mutation c.2912-3C>G. Small deletions/insertions constituted nearly half of the mutant alleles (10/22, 45%), indicating a unique mutation spectrum in this cohort of Chinese NP-C patients.Our data confirm in a clinical setting that screening plasma 7-ketocholesterol is an efficient and practical diagnostic tool to identify NP-C patients from suspect individuals. Patients without neuropsychological involvement could also be identified by this method therefore allowing an opportunity for earlier treatment.",

        "abstract": "Molecular characterization of PAH deficiency has been proven essential in establishing treatment options. We examine the diagnostic accuracy of two genetic assays to predict BH4 responsiveness: to determine whether the AV sum test or mutation-status assessment test can obviate the need for BH4 loading in Chinese patients. The overall predicted response in 346 patients was 31.65% by the AV sum test and 25.43% by the other assay; both percentages were lower than 51.06% derived from loading results in 94 patients. Responders were compound heterozygotes with definite BH4 responsive mutations, while non-responders had null/null ones; some consistently with specific mutations and genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity of the assays were 81.1% and 92.5% for the AV sum, and 82.9%, 97.3% for the other. An AV sum cutoff >2 has a positive predictive value (PPV) of 90.9%, while the presence of at least one BH4 responsive mutation has a PPV of 97.1%. The two approaches showed good concordance. Our data confirmed that the mutation-status assessment has a higher diagnostic accuracy in predicting response for Chinese patients than the AV sum test. BH4-responsiveness may be predicted or excluded from patients' molecular characteristics to some extent, thus some patients may avoid the initial loading.",

        "abstract": "Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (CLAH) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by defective synthesis of all steroids. This disorder is characterized by 46,XY sex reversal, skin hyperpigmentation, early-onset adrenal crisis and enlarged adrenal with fatty accumulation. CLAH is caused by mutations in the STAR gene. The clinical features and STAR gene mutation spectrum of a large cohort of Chinese patients with CLAH were not reported previously. We performed clinical retrospective review and genetic analysis of the STAR gene in ten unrelated Chinese phenotypic female patients who were clinically diagnosed with CLAH and followed up in our hospital from 2006 to 2015. All ten patients, including two 46,XY females and eight 46,XX females, presented skin hyperpigmentation and early salt-wasting episode, and showed normal growth and development after steroid replacement treatment. Totally 20 mutant alleles containing 11 different STAR gene mutations were identified in these ten patients, including five novel variants (two missense and three null variants), all predicted to be pathogenic in bioinformatics analysis, and six mutations described in previous literature. Among these 11 mutations, a reported mutation c.772Cu003eT and a novel variant c.707_708delinsCTT were most frequent, accounting for 35% and 15% of the total mutant alleles, respectively. This is the first report of a large Chinese cohort with CLAH, presenting the mutation spectrum of the STAR gene and two possible founder mutations in the Chinese population, which may contribute to better genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency is an extremely rare autosomal recessive inborn error of fatty acid metabolism. It usually follows a severe disease course and presents poor prognosis without treatment. Here, we report an affected female juvenile with a mild clinical and biochemical phenotype who mainly featured poor schooling without cardiomyopathy and metabolic acidosis. She was suspected of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency due to a 57-kb deletion in 16q23.3 encompassing the MLCYD gene revealed by chromosome microarray. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency was then confirmed by acylcarnitine analysis and organic acid analysis. Real-time PCR analysis of the patient revealed the first three exon deletion of the MLYCD gene, which was maternally inherited. DNA sequencing of the MLYCD gene of the patient identified a novel heterozygous mutation (c.911Gu003eA, p.G304E) in exon 4 that was paternally inherited. The patient urine malonic acid dissolved and had a better school record in 6 month after initiation of fat-limited diet. At 1 year post treatment, the blood malonylcarnitine level decreased remarkably. Our result expands the phenotype of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency and suggests attentions should be paid to the mild form of disorders, for example, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, which usually present a severe disease course. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Non-invasive test of MMA for pregnant women facilitates safe and timely prenatal diagnosis of the disease. In our study, we aimed to design and validate a haplotype-based noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT) method for cblC type of MMA. Targeted capture sequencing using customized hybridization was performed utilizing gDNA (genomic DNA) of trios including parents and an affected proband to determine parental haplotypes associated with the mutant and wild allele. The fetal haplotype was inferred later based on the high depth sequencing data of maternal plasma as well as haplotype linkage analysis. The fetal genotypes deduced by NIPT were further validated by amniocentesis. Haplotype-based NIPT was successfully performed in 21 families. The results of NIPT of 21 families were all consistent with invasive prenatal diagnosis, which was interpreted in a blinded fashion. Three fetuses were identified as compound heterozygosity of  MMACHC , 9 fetuses were carriers of  MMACHC  variant, and 9 fetuses were normal. These results indicated that the haplotype-based NIPT for MMA through small target capture region sequencing is technically accurate and feasible.",

We established a population-based retrospective registry for the disease in the city's registered population during 1997-2011 and collected 622 incident type 1 diabetes in children aged 0-14 years. Standardized incidence rates and 95 % CI were estimated by applying the capture-recapture method and assuming Poisson distribution. Incidence trend was analyzed using the Poisson regression model. The mean annual incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes was 3.1 per 100,000 person-years. We did not observe significant difference in incidence between boys and girls. The incidence is unstable and had a mean annual increase 14.2 % per year during the studied period. A faster annual increase was observed in boys, warmer seasons, and in the outer regions of the city. If present trends continue, the number of new type 1 diabetes cases will double from 2016 to 2020, and prevalent cases will sextuple by 2025. Our results showed the incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes was rising rapidly in Shanghai. More studies are needed to analyze incidence changes in other regions of China for appropriate allocation of healthcare resources.",

All identified CNVs were verified with database of genomic variations (DGV), DECIPHER, ISCA and the literature.Nineteen clinically relevant CNVs were detected among the 16 individuals. The diagnostic yield for the MR/DD patients was 24.2%. The most common abnormality was Phelan-McDermid syndrome (3/16, 18.8%), which was followed by Prader-Willi syndrome/Angelman syndrome (2/16, 12.5%) and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (2/16, 12.5%).CNVs are one of the most common causes for unexplained MR/DD. CMA can improve the detection rate of CNVs and confer genetic testing with greater sensitivity in elucidating the diagnosis for unexplained MR/DD.",

        "abstract": "Mucolipidosis II \u03b1/\u03b2, mucolipidosis III \u03b1/\u03b2, and mucolipidosis III \u03b3 are autosomal recessive disorders belonging to the family of lysosomal storage disorders caused by deficiency of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, a lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) localized in the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for normal processing and packaging of soluble lysosomal enzymes with initiating the first step of tagging lysosomal enzymes with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P). Mucolipidosis II and III are caused by mutations in the GNPTAB and GNPTG genes, and patients with these diseases are characterized by short stature, skeletal abnormalities, and developmental delay. In this study we report 38 patients with mucolipidosis II and III enrolled in Eastern China during the past 8 years. The diagnosis was made based on clinical characteristics and measurement of plasma lysosomal enzyme activity. Sanger sequencing of GNPTAB and/or GNPTG for all patients and real-time quantitative PCR were performed to confirm the diagnosis. In addition, 11 cases of prenatal mucolipidosis II were diagnosed based on measurement of the enzyme activity in amniotic fluid supernatant and genetic testing of cultured amniotic cells. Based on molecular genetic tests, 30 patients were diagnosed with mucolipidosis II \u03b1/\u03b2, 6 were diagnosed with III \u03b1/\u03b2 and 2 were diagnosed with III \u03b3. Thirty-seven different GNPTAB gene mutations were identified in 29 patients with mucolipidosis II \u03b1/\u03b2 and six patients with III \u03b1/\u03b2. These mutations included 22 new mutations (p.W44X, p.E279X, p.W416X, p.W463X, p.Q802X, p.Q882X, p.A34P, p.R334P, p.D408N, p.D534N, p.Y997C, p.D1018V, p.L1025S, p.L1033P, c.88_89delAC, c.890_891insT, c.1150_1151insTTA, c.1523delG, c.2473_2474insA, c.2980_2983delGCCT, c.3094delA, and deletion of exon 9). Four new GNPTG gene mutations were identified (c.13delC, p.Y81X, p.G126R and c.609+1delG) in two mucolipidosis III \u03b3 patients. Among the 11 cases of prenatal diagnosis, four were mucolipidosis II fetuses, three were heterozygous, and the remaining four were normal fetuses. This study expands the mutation spectrum of the GNPTAB and GNPTG genes and contributes to specific knowledge of mucolipidosis II/III in a population from Eastern China.",

Methods The retrospective CAH screening data during 2008-2011 from our center were investigated. The source data was separated into 2 group based on the traditional CAH screening indicators 17-OHP cut-off 30 nmol/L. 11 130 cases with 17-OHP value<30 nmol/L were selected randomly as the normal group, 398 cases including congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients(CAH) with 17-OHP value \u226530 nmol/L were set as the positive group. A discriminate equation and a new positive cutoff which involving the neonatal gestational age, weight, and 17-OHP value were set up by using of the unstandardized Fisher analysis program. All positive samples including 24 CAH patients and 381 false positive cases which were validated by the traditional 17-OHP cut off were re-evaluated with new set criterion. Results A discriminant equation base on the source data were established as Z=(-0.019\u00b7x1)+(-0.00012\u00b7x2)+0.055\u00b7x3 +0.471, and the new positive cut off was set as 1.314. The data of 24 real CAH patients was verified with new set discriminating formula, and the result was confirmed as 100%(24/24) agreed as its previous diagnosis. 27%(156/573) false positive cases were change into negative after the data was re-evaluated by new method. Conclusion The multi-factor discrimant analysis for neonatal CAH screening will expect to significantly reduce the false positive rate, therefore it show more reasonable and feasible in neonatal screening.",

Both pH and viscosity of egg yolk, albumin and whole egg had obviously changed with the increase of storage time, and the changes were more significant after freezing the samples for 10 h. The structures of the albumen and yolk frozen for 10 h began to change. After 24 h, yolk became smooth and tight, with gel, formed. And the change was irreversible after 36 h. Therefore, the quality of eggs can be greatly reduced to be substandard by frozen storage at -20\u00b0C for 10 h.",

The effects of the inoculation amount, pH, fermentation temperature, sugar content, and sodium citrates buffer system on deacidification and the growth of Lactobacillus Plantarum LP-L134-1-P in plum juice were studied. The results showed that the total acids increased at the first stage and then decreased during the fermentation. The MLF proceeded normally at pH 3.50 with the inoculation amount of 108 CFU/g. And the bigger inoculation amount was, the more acids were reduced through MLF. When the inoculation amount was increased to 109 CFU/g and pH was 3.50, the MLF could be performed only if the fermentation temperature was more than 25\u00b0C. It would be easy to perform MLF when the inoculation amount was 109 CFU/g and pH was no less than 3.10. The acidity of plum juice went up with addition of 1.00% glucose, indicating that glucose was prior to convert into lactic acid, thus inhibiting the MLF. In sodium citrates buffer system, the acidity was not reduced, proving that Lactobacillus Plantarum LP-L134-1-P could not use citric acid as carbon resource to run MLF.",

This paper presents novel nanocomposites by reacting terbium salt with the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) at different pHs, Which were characterized by SEM, TEM, FTIR, XPS, WAXD, GPC, UV-Vis, and PL. The results show that Tb3+ ions react with O of COO-, -OH, and -COC on NaCMC. The morphologies of these nanocomposites showed spheroidal-like with the size around 100 nm at around neutral pH, but show rod-like and band-like around 100 nm in width and about 500 nm in length at pH\u2009=\u200911 and 12. They emit bright green characteristic fluorescence of Tb3+ under ultraviolet light due to the antenna effect when NaCMC transfer the energy efficiently to the Tb ions around neutral pHs. However, at higher pH, they show weaker fluorescence intensity in spite of strong crystalline because abundant Na+ are involved in them and affected the efficiency of energy transfer between NaCMC and Tb3+. These nanocomposites could find potential biological applications base on their fluorescent and biodegradable properties. POLYM.

The analysis of the rheological behavior of the composites demonstrated that all fluorescent composites exhibited similar shear-shining and thixotropy properties as both the CMC and HPCMC solutions. This suggested that these fluorescent composites could be used as coating materials in the paper-making industry for making functional paper.

The hydrothermal carbonization was carried out in an autoclave from 130 to 230\u00a0\u00b0C, and solid fuels and stable oxygen containing liquid fuels were successfully obtained simultaneously. Results showed that with the temperature increased, polymerization and carbonization between sugars and sugar derivatives were accelerated and concurrent. The increase in final pressure and yields of extraction phase when the temperature was over 190\u00a0\u00b0C was mainly occurred by depolymerization of the polymer. The maximum yield, energy recovery efficiency, and carbon recovery efficiency of solid fuel (hydrochar) were 11.22\u00a0wt%, 50.38%, and 18.04%, respectively. The carbon content of hydrochars ranged from 63.87 to 73.95\u00a0wt%, and the high heating value (HHV) of hydrochars ranged from 25.51 to 30.48\u00a0MJ/kg. Compared with the water-like phase of bio-oil, the carbon content and high heating value of hydrochars were increased 1.58\u20131.84 times and 4.35\u20135.29 times, respectively. Combining the FT-IR spectra of hydrochars and ethyl acetate (EA) phase results, phenolic compounds were detected to be incorporated with hydrochars and the incorporation of both phenol, 1,2-Benzenediol was occurred when the temperature increased to 190\u00a0\u00b0C.",

The results show that (1) pH value significantly and irregularly affects the oxidation degree of DACMC, and the oxidation degree reaches its maximum at pH 1.5, with an aldehyde content of 54.35%; (2) carbonyl groups are introduced into the molecular chain of CMC, which is verified by FT-IR and 13C NMR results; (3) the crystallinity of DACMC is higher than that of CMC and increases with pH value; (4) due to the break of glucopyranose rings, the molecular chain of DACMC becomes softer, entangles with each other more compactly and arranges more regularly, while the Z dimension of DACMC surface decreases with the increase of aldehyde content; and (5) the thermal stability of DACMC is poorer than that of CMC, especially in the condition of pH 1.5.",

In addition, the relationship between those factors and the intermolecular structure of HEC in solutions has been discussed. It was indicated that,the change of apparent viscosity of HEC along with concentration tallied with the experience expressions of Huggins; with the time prolongation,the chains of HEC in aqueous solution slacked which resulted in the decrease of the apparent viscosity of the solutions; and the HEC solutions presented a typical behavior of pseudoplastic fluid.

Methods PvuII polymorphisms of estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ESR1)gene were analyzed in 100 naive patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving interferonalpha treatment by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Results Among PP,Pp and pp genotype group,the early virological response were markedly higher in PP genotype groups (70.8%) than 40.0% in Pp and 37.2% in pp genotype group (P<0.05),while neither the combined response nor HBeAg disappearance or seroconversion among PP,Pp and pp genotype groups had no significant difference (P> 0.05). Conclusion PvuII genotype polymorphism of ESR1 is associated with early virological response to IFN-\u03b1 in patients with CHB and the detection of PvuII genotype polymorphism might be helpful for predicting early response to IFN-\u03b1 treatment.",

Methods Serum samples from 196 HBV DNA positive patients with HBV infection, including 3 acute icteric hepatitis(AIH),107 chronic hepatitis B(CHB),59 liver cirrhosis(LC),6 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),20 chronic severe hepatitis (CSH),and 1 subacute severe hepatitis (SSH), were collected and tested for HBV genotypes by Caplier-1000 Microchip electrophoresis. Results Of the 196 patiens,126[FQ(9\u300246,X-WZ][CD44](64.3%) were genotype B and 59(30.1%) were genotype C, the rest of them 11(5.6%) were genotype BC combination. Genotype B was preponderant between changjiang and huaihe river, and was more prevalent than genotype C in the CHB and LC(P<0.05). The value of HBV DNA and the rate of e-Ag positive was no significant among the detected genotypes, while significantly higher in genotype C than in genotype B (P<0.05) in the patients of the LC group. Conclusion Genotype B, C and BC combination exist in several hospitals of Anhui province, and genotype B is the major genotype in this area. The outcomes of HBV genotype B infection is related to CHB, and genotype C is correlated with LC.",

Methods We used automatic biochemistry to analyse serum ALT,AST and TBil. We also used ELISA to detect HBV serum markers, meanwhile the patients underwent percutaneous liver biopsies to estimate the histopathological injury and hepatic expression of HBsAg and HBcAg by immunohistochemical detection. Results All 51 patients with serum HBsAg positive had positive HBsAg and/or HBcAg expression in liver tissues, and 9(28.1%)cases expressed HBsAg and/or HBcAg in liver tissues in 32 with serum HBsAg negative. There was no statistical difference between serum AST, ALT, and bilirubin and hepatic activity index in 75 patients with chronic liver disease. According to the pathological diagnosis, the accuracy of clinical diagnosis in mild and moderate chronic hepatitis was 61.9% and 62.5%, and in cirrhosis was 40%, respectively. Conclusions The accuracy of clinical diagnosis in patients with liver disease is low. It's necessary to do liver histology examination for relatively correct diagnosis in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), is a polyphagous pest. In order to monitor and control B. dorsalis effectively, it is necessary to investigate the potential distributional areas of this pest. In this study, an ecological niche modeling method, machine-learning algorithm for nonparametric prediction of species distribution (the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction, or GARP), combined with Spatial Analysis function in GIS Geographic Information System) program, was applied to predict potential geographic distribution of B. dorsalis in Asia, especially in China. On the basis of the data about current distribution of B. dorsalis in China and 14 environmental and geological covariates in Asia, the resulting GARP geographic predictions were exported as ASCII raster grid files into ArcGIS8. 3 for further analysis. Projection of the distribution of B. dorsalis in Asia indicated that the pest could be distributed to some Asian countries and regions including China, Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, northern Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, broadly across eastern and southern Asia. The results were in agreement with the known worldwide distribution regions of B dorsalis reported by the EPPO European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization). Using the same sets of ecological dimensions and taking the model agreement into account, the ecological niche model was projected onto the landscape of provinces, municipalities and counties in China. The results showed that the most part of Yunnan Province, eastern and southern part of Sichuan Province, most part of Guizhou Province and Chongqing Municipality, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Hong Kong, Macao, Guangdong, Taiwan, Hainan, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, most part of Zhejiang, Hunan and Hubei provinces, Shanghai Municipality, southern part of Jiangsu, and some parts of Henan and Anhui provinces were suitable establishment areas of B. dorsalis' invasion, surrounded by sub-suitable establishment areas, which included some scattered areas in Sichuan Province, Guizhou Province, Chongqing Municipality, northern part of Hubei province and southern part of Jiangsu and Henan provinces. Host fruit plants have been cultivated at high densities in both suitable and sub-suitable establishment areas. The remaining test points were overlaid with the distributional maps to determine the numbers falling within the areas of predicted present and test the validity of this approach, and the one-tailed goodness-of-fit \u03c72-statistics were employed to assess the significance of the model. All of our predictions were highly statistically significant, indicating an excellent predictive ability. The success of this test demonstrated that the ecological niche modeling approaches provide a promising tool for addressing a wide range of issues in ecology, biogeography and conservation biology, and open door to many synthetic analyses based on primary sets of present-day point occurrence information. Moreover, this methodology provides a technical platform for the suitability analysis, monitoring, prevention and control of the pest.",

Here we discuss a variant of these schemes, in which gate operations are performed in nuclear-spin-dependentoptical lattices, formed by near-resonant coupling to the metastable excited state. This provides an alternative to a previous\n scheme [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 170504 (2008)], which involved independent lattices for different electronicstates. As in the previous case, we show how existing ideas for quantum computing with Alkali atoms such as entanglement via\n controlled collisions can be freed from important technical restrictions. We also provide additional details on the use of\n collisional losses from metastable states to perform gate operations via a lossy blockade mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Highest-resolution laser spectroscopy has generally been limited to single trapped ion systems because of the rapid decoherence that plagues neutral atom ensembles. Precision spectroscopy of ultracold neutral atoms confined in a trapping potential now shows superior optical coherence without any deleterious effects from motional degrees of freedom, revealing optical resonance linewidths at the hertz level with a good signal-to-noise ratio. The resonance quality factor of 2.4 x 10(14) is the highest ever recovered in any form of coherent spectroscopy. The spectral resolution permits direct observation of the breaking of nuclear spin degeneracy for the 1S0 and 3P0 optical clock states of 87Sr under a small magnetic bias field. This optical approach for excitation of nuclear spin states allows an accurate measurement of the differential Land\u00e9 g factor between 1S0 and 3P0. The optical atomic coherence demonstrated for collective excitation of a large number of atoms will have a strong impact on quantum measurement and precision frequency metrology.",

This optical-frequency-comb-based breath analysis system comes with excellent performance in all criteria: high detection sensitivity, ability to identify and distinguish a large number of analytes, and simultaneous, real-time information processing. We demonstrate a minimum detectable absorption of 8 x 10(-10)cm(-1), a spectral resolution of 800 MHz, and 200 nm of spectral coverage from 1.5 to 1.7 microm where strong and unique molecular fingerprints exist for many biomarkers. We present a series of breath measurements including stable isotope ratios of CO(2), breath concentrations of CO, and the presence of trace concentrations of NH(3) in high concentrations of H(2)O.",

The use of an optical cavity to enhance\ncoherent Rayleigh scattering into a decaying cavity mode has been suggested as\na potential method to mitigate Raman loss, thereby enabling the laser cooling\nof molecules to ultracold temperatures. We discuss the possibility of\ncavity-assisted laser cooling particles without closed transitions, identify\nconditions necessary to achieve efficient cooling, and suggest solutions given\nexperimental constraints. Specifically, it is shown that cooperativities much\ngreater than unity are required for cooling without loss, and that this could\nbe achieved via the superradiant scattering associated with intracavity\nself-localization of the molecules. Particular emphasis is given to the polar\nhydroxyl radical (OH), cold samples of which are readily obtained from Stark\ndeceleration.",

        "abstract": "Optical frequency comb-based cavity-ringdown spectroscopy has recently enabled high-sensitivity absorption detection of molecules over a broad spectral range. We demonstrate an improved system based on a mode-locked erbium-doped fiber laser source centered at 1.5 microm, resulting in a spectrometer that is inexpensive, simple, and robust. It provides a very large spectral bandwidth (1.45-1.65 microm) for investigation of a wide variety of molecular absorptions. Strong molecular absorptions at 1.5 mum allow for detection at sensitivities approaching the 1 part in 10(9) volume level. We provide a detailed description of our spectrometer and present measurements of the rovibrational spectra for CO, NH3, and C2H2 with an absorption sensitivity of 2 x 10(-8) cm(-1)Hz(-1/2) per detection channel.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental limit to the sensitivity of optical interferometry is thermal noise that drives fluctuations in the positions of the surfaces of the interferometer's mirrors, and thereby in the phase of the intracavity field. Schemes for reducing this thermally driven phase noise are presented that rely upon the coherent character of the underlying displacements and strains. Although the position of the physical surface fluctuates, the optical phase upon reflection can have reduced sensitivity to this motion. While practical implementation of such schemes for coherent compensation face certain challenges, we hope to stimulate further work on this important thermal noise problem.",

        "abstract": "Cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy combines broad bandwidth, high spectral resolution, and ultrahigh detection sensitivity in one experimental platform based on an optical frequency comb efficiently coupled to a high-finesse cavity. The effective interaction length between light and matter is increased by the cavity, massively enhancing the sensitivity for measurement of optical losses. Individual comb components act as independent detection channels across a broad spectral window, providing rapid parallel processing. In this review we discuss the principles, the technology, and the first applications that demonstrate the enormous potential of this spectroscopic method. In particular, we describe various frequency comb sources, techniques for efficient coupling between comb and cavity, and detection schemes that utilize the technique's high-resolution, wide-bandwidth, and fast data-acquisition capabilities. We discuss a range of applications, including breath analysis for medical diagnosis, trace-impurity detection in specialty gases, and characterization of a supersonic jet of cold molecules.",

We differentiate\n between two separate regimes of molecule loss during the slowing process. The first mechanism involves distributed loss due\n to coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion, while the second is a result of the rapid decrease of the molecular velocity\n within the final few stages. In this work, we describe these effects and present means for overcoming them. Solutions based\n on modified switching time sequences with the existing decelerator geometry lead to a large gain of stable molecules in the\n intermediate velocity regime, but fail to address the loss at very low final velocities. We propose a new decelerator design,\n the quadrupole-guiding decelerator, which eliminates distributed loss due to transverse/longitudinal couplings throughout\n the slowing process and also exhibits gain over normal deceleration to the lowest velocities.",

The use of weak pulses permits an analytic description within the framework of coherent control in the perturbative regime, while coherent accumulation of many pulse pairs enables near unity transfer efficiency with a high spectral selectivity, thus forming a powerful combination of pump-dump control schemes and the precision of the frequency comb. The concept is presented analytically and its feasibility and robustness are verified by simulations of dynamics in Rb2.

This result is achieved in two steps. First, active cancellation of the fiber-transmission noise reduces timing jitter caused by path length fluctuations to a record level of 16 fs. Second, using a wide bandwidth interactivity actuator, the slave laser is synchronized to the incoming stable pulse train from the reference laser to within 10 fs. These results are confirmed by an optical cross-correlation measurement performed independently of the feedback loop operated in the microwave domain.",

An adjustable electric field of sufficient magnitude to polarize the OH is\nsuperimposed on the trap in either a quadrupole or homogenous field geometry.\nThe OH is confined by an overall potential established via molecular state\nmixing induced by the combined electric and magnetic fields acting on the\nmolecule's electric dipole and magnetic dipole moments, respectively. An\neffective molecular Hamiltonian including Stark and Zeeman terms has been\nconstructed to describe single molecule dynamics inside the trap. Monte Carlo\nsimulation using this Hamiltonian accurately models the observed trap dynamics\nin various trap configurations. Confinement of cold polar molecules in a\nmagnetic trap, leaving large, adjustable electric fields for control, is an\nimportant step towards the study of low energy dipole-dipole collisions.",

The actuator displays a transfer function with a flat amplitude response and greater than 135 masculine phase margin up to 200 kHz, allowing a 180 kHz unity gain frequency to be achieved in a closed servo loop. To the best of our knowledge, this actuator has achieved the largest servo bandwidth for a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). The actuator should be very useful in a wide variety of applications requiring precision control of optical lengths, including laser frequency stabilization, optical interferometers, and optical communications.",

These include improved strategies for interrogation of the resonant quantum reference sample, improved accuracy and control of the modulation process, demonstration of an external modulation-removal strategy, and a rich field of new possibilities for frequency measurement, particularly the arrival of broad optical comb generation techniques. Frequency-domain methods based on broad femtosec laser combs are very promising, as made clear by the work of Udem and H\u00e4nsch. We easily see beats at 805 nm with optical comb lines whose center is at 840 nm, a 16 THz interval. Adjustment of the laser compensation broadens the comb to >140 nm width at - 3 dB ! Stabilization of both optical center frequency and pulse rate has been implemented. Interesting combs are also generated near 1060 nm with Kourogi's modulator-in-a-cavity approach, augmented by an intracavity LiNbO3 crystal which provides OPO gain and frequency connection to the stable pump. So far, about 15 000 coherent comb lines are generated, limited by uncompensated dispersion in the OPO cavity. Useful data regarding S/N necessary for accurate counting and a powerful adaptive Phase- Tracking Filter/Oscillator are discussed.",

While the\npresence and concentration of many of these molecules are poorly understood,\nmany 'biomarker' molecules have been correlated to specific diseases and\nmetabolic processes. Such correlations can result in non-invasive methods of\nhealth screening for a wide variety of medical conditions. In this article we\npresent human breath analysis using an optical-frequency-comb-based trace\ndetection system with excellent performance in all criteria: detection\nsensitivity, ability to identify and distinguish a large number of biomarkers,\nand measurement time. We demonstrate a minimum detectable absorption of 8 x\n10-10 cm-1, a spectral resolution of 800 MHz, and 200 nm of spectral coverage\nfrom 1.5 to 1.7 micron where strong and unique molecular fingerprints exist for\nmany biomarkers. We present a series of breath measurements including stable\nisotope ratios of CO2, breath concentrations of CO, and the presence of trace\nconcentrations of NH3 in high concentrations of H2O.",

The stability of a cw iodine-stabilized laser is transferred to millions of comb lines (with an instability of 3 x 10(-13)) covering more than one octave of the optical frequency spectrum.

        "abstract": "Carrier-envelope phase stabilization of few cycle optical pulses has recently been realized. This advance in femtosecond technology is important in both extreme nonlinear optics and optical frequency metrology. The development of air-silica microstructure fiber was an enabling technology for performing phase stabilization. The microstructure fiber provides a group-velocity zero within the spectral region that can be accessed with titanium sapphire lasers. The presence of a group-velocity zero allows the output spectrum of the laser to be broadened so that it exceeds one octave, which is necessary for our phase stabilization technique. We will present the basics of the technique and role played by the microstructure fiber. Measurement of the nonlinear phase shift in the fiber is also performed to determine the contribution of amplitude to phase noise conversion.",

        "abstract": "A novel nonthermal plasma dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) system for decontamination, sterilization, and medical applications has been developed. The discharge is physically removed from the disinfection zone, and plasma-induced free radicals are delivered through an air stream. The physical distance between the discharge and the treatment surface can be up to 3 m, making the technology robust and flexible for applications in the medical clinic. The bactericidal properties of the free-radical effluent are enhanced by hydrogen peroxide additives. We report a 6-log reduction in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria strains in under 1 min of exposure in vitro and inactivation of Bacillus atrophaes spores and Escherichia coli biofilms. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide additives is seen to be a key variable in inactivation efficacy, suggesting that active species in our experiment may be different than in other DBD configurations. Precise chemical concentration measurements using direct frequency comb spectroscopy show presence of ozone ( O3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In vivo multiple exposures of mouse skin to the plasma effluent do not yield any adverse effects.",

        "abstract": ".\u00a0\u00a0We analyze several possibilities for precisely measuring electronic transitions in\n atomic helium by the direct use of phase-stabilized femtosecond frequency combs. Because the comb\n is self-calibrating and can be shifted into the ultraviolet spectral region via harmonic\n generation, it offers the prospect of greatly improved accuracy for UV and far-UV transitions. To\n take advantage of this accuracy an ultracold helium sample is needed. For measurements of the\n triplet spectrum a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to cool and trap metastable 23S\n state atoms. We analyze schemes for measuring the two-photon 23S \u219243S interval, and for resonant two-photon excitation to high Rydberg states, 23S \u219233P \u2192n3S,\u00a0D. We also analyze experiments on the singlet-state spectrum. To accomplish this we propose schemes for producing and trapping\n ultracold helium in the 11S or 21S state via intercombination transitions. A particularly intriguing scenario is the possibility of measuring the 11S \u219221S transition with extremely high accuracy by use of two-photon excitation in a magic wavelength trap that operates identically\n for both states. We predict a \u201ctriple magic wavelength\u201d at 412\u00a0nm that could facilitate numerous experiments on trapped helium\n atoms, because here the polarizabilities of the 11S, 21S and 23S states are all similar, small, and positive.",

The instability of the measurement system is below 7 x 10(-15) at 1 s.

Both the repetition rate ( ) and the carrier-envelope offset frequency ( ) of the idler wave are phase-locked to microwave signals referenced to a Cs clock. We describe the detailed design and construction of the frequency comb, and discuss potential applications for precise and sensitive direct frequency comb spectroscopy.",

        "abstract": "Ultracold atoms and molecules provide ideal stages for precision tests of fundamental physics. With microkelvin neutral strontium atoms confined in an optical lattice, we have achieved a fractional resolution of 4\u00a3 10\u00a115 on the 1S0 \u00a13 P0 doubly-forbidden 87Sr clock transition at 698 nm. The overall systematic uncertainty of the clock is evaluated below the 10\u00a115 level. The ultrahigh spectral resolution permits resolving the nuclear spin states of the clock transition at small magnetic fields, leading to measurements of the 3P0 magnetic moment and metastable lifetime. In addition, photoassociation spectroscopy performed on the narrow 1S0\u00a13 P1 transition of 88Sr shows promise for efficient optical tuning of the ground state scattering length and production of ultracold ground- state molecules. Lattice-confined Sr2 molecules are suitable for constraining the time-variation of electron-proton mass ratio. In a separate experiment, cold, ground state polar molecules produced from Stark decelerators have enabled an order of magnitude improvement in measurement precision of ground-state, L-doublet microwave transitions in the OH molecule. Comparing the laboratory results to those from OH megamasers in interstellar space will allow a sensitivity of 10\u00a16 for measuring the potential time variation of the fundamental fine structure constant D a /a over 1010 years. These results have also led to improved understandings in the molecular structure. The study of the low magnetic field behavior of OH in its 2P3=2 ro-vibronic ground state precisely determines a differential Land\u00e9 g-factor between opposite parity components of the L-doublet.",

Clock frequency shifts due to magnetic and optical fields are\ndiscussed with an emphasis on those relating to nuclear structure. An\nexperimental determination of the differential g-factor in $^{87}$Sr is\nperformed and is in good agreement with theory. The magnitude of the tensor\nlight shift on the clock states is also explored experimentally. State specific\nmeasurements with controlled nuclear spin polarization are discussed as a\nmethod to reduce the nuclear spin-related systematic effects to below\n10$^{-17}$ in lattice clocks.",

        "abstract": "Besides serving as a frequency counter or clockwork, an optical frequency comb can be used directly for spectroscopy, thus the name Direct Frequency Comb Spectroscopy (DFCS). Precise phase coherence among successive ultrashort pulses allow one to explore both fast dynamics in the time domain and high-resolution structural information in the frequency domain. Coherent accumulation of weak pulses can lead to strong field effects. Combined with spectral manipulation, high-resolution quantum control can be implemented. The large number of frequency comb components also provide a massive set of parallel detection channels to gather spectroscopic information. In this chapter we provide a detailed review of some of the current applications that exploit these unique features, and discuss several future directions of DFCS.",

An air-silica microstructure optical fiber broadens the frequency comb of a femtosecond laser to span the optical octave from 1064 to 532 nm, enabling us to measure the 282 THz frequency of an iodine-stabilized Nd:YAG laser directly in terms of the microwave frequency that controls the comb spacing. Additional measurements of established optical frequencies at 633 and 778 nm using the same femtosecond comb confirm the accepted uncertainties for these standards.",

Laser-cooled neutral atoms localized in a deeply confining optical potential satisfy this requirement. With an appropriate choice of wavelength and polarization for the optical trap, two electronic states of an atom can experience the same trapping potential, permitting coherent control of electronic transitions independent of the atomic center-of-mass motion. Here, we review a number of recent experiments that use this approach to investigate precision quantum metrology for optical atomic clocks and coherent control of optical interactions of single atoms and photons within the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. We also provide a brief survey of promising prospects for future work.",

In this paper, we present an extensive description of the systems\nand techniques necessary to realize 689 nm 1S0 - 3P1 narrow line cooling of\natomic 88Sr. Narrow line cooling and trapping dynamics are also studied in\ndetail. By controlling the relative size of the power broadened transition\nlinewidth and the single-photon recoil frequency shift, we show that it is\npossible to continuously bridge the gap between semiclassical and quantum\nmechanical cooling. Novel semiclassical cooling process, some of which are\nintimately linked to gravity, are also explored. Moreover, for laser\nfrequencies tuned above the atomic resonance, we demonstrate momentum-space\ncrystals containing up to 26 well defined lattice points. Gravitationally\nassisted cooling is also achieved with blue-detuned light. Theoretically, we\nfind the blue detuned dynamics are universal to Doppler limited systems. This\npaper offers the most comprehensive study of narrow line laser cooling to date.",

Vibrational energy intervals are sensitive to changes of the mass ratio.

The possibility of applying the zero-differential-Stark-shift optical lattice technique is explored to measure vibrational transitions at high accuracy.",

Precise control of the optical frequency comb allows highly efficient, coherent coupling\n of individual comb components with corresponding resonant modes of the high-finesse cavity. The long cavity lifetime dramatically\n enhances the effective interaction between the light field and intracavity matter, increasing the sensitivity for measurement\n of optical losses by a factor that is on the order of the cavity finesse. The use of low-dispersion mirrors permits almost\n the entire spectral bandwidth of the frequency comb to be employed for detection, covering a range of \u223c\u200910% of the actual\n optical frequency. The light transmitted from the cavity is spectrally resolved to provide a multitude of detection channels\n with spectral resolutions ranging from several gigahertz to hundreds of kilohertz. In this review we will discuss the principle\n of cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy and the various implementations of such systems. In particular, we discuss\n several types of UV, optical, and IR frequency comb sources and optical cavity designs that can be used for specific spectroscopic\n applications. We present several cavity-comb coupling methods to take advantage of the broad spectral bandwidth and narrow\n spectral components of a frequency comb. Finally, we present a series of experimental measurements on trace gas detections,\n human breath analysis, and characterization of cold molecular beams. These results demonstrate clearly that the wide bandwidth\n and ultrasensitive nature of the femtosecond enhancement cavity enables powerful real-time detection and identification of\n many molecular species in a massively parallel fashion.",

This advance necessitates unifying optical frequency-comb technology with strong-field atomic physics. Whereas strong-field studies of HHG have often focused on above-threshold harmonic generation (photon energy above the ionization potential), for vacuum-ultraviolet frequency combs an understanding of below-threshold harmonic orders and their generation process is crucial. Here, we present a new and quantitative study of the harmonics 7-13 generated below and near the ionization threshold in xenon gas with an intense 1,070 nm driving field. We show multiple generation pathways for these harmonics that are manifested as on-axis interference in the harmonic yield. This discovery provides a new understanding of the strong-field, below-threshold dynamics under the influence of an atomic potential and allows us to quantitatively assess the achievable coherence of a vacuum-ultraviolet frequency comb generated through below-threshold harmonics. We find that under reasonable experimental conditions, temporal coherence is maintained. As evidence, we present the first explicit vacuum-ultraviolet frequency-comb structure beyond the third harmonic.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate the generation of phase-coherent frequency combs in the vacuum utraviolet spectral region. The output from a mode-locked laser is stabilized to a femtosecond enhancement cavity with a gas jet at the intracavity focus. The resulting high-peak power of the intracavity pulse enables efficient high- harmonic generation by utilizing the full repetition rate of the laser. Optical-heterodyne-based measure- ments reveal that the coherent frequency comb structure of the original laser is fully preserved in the high- harmonic generation process. These results open the door for precision frequency metrology at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths and permit the efficient generation of phase-coherent high-order harmonics using only a standard laser oscillator without active amplification of single pulses. field provides the necessary peak intensity for ionization of atoms or molecules for HHG where the liberated photo- electron recollides with the parent ion resulting in coherent light emission. The advances documented in this Letter enable a unification of these research fields, generating a high repetition rate (at the laser's original 100 MHz repe- tition frequency) and phase-controlled frequency comb in the XUV region, which is shown to maintain a definitive phase relationship with respect to the original comb in the near infrared. The spectral resolution demonstrated here can extend direct frequency comb spectroscopy (9) into the",

Total quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of isolated C molecules has been of particularly long-standing interest. Such observations have, to date, been unsuccessful owing to the difficulty in preparing cold, gas-phase C in sufficiently high densities. Here we report high-resolution infrared absorption spectroscopy of C in the 8.5-micron spectral region (1180 to 1190 wave number). A combination of cryogenic buffer-gas cooling and cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy has enabled the observation of quantum state-resolved rovibrational transitions. Characteristic nuclear spin statistical intensity patterns confirm the indistinguishability of the 60 carbon-12 atoms, while rovibrational fine structure encodes further details of the molecule's rare icosahedral symmetry.",

We measure loss rate coefficients for atomic samples between 1 and 6 \u03bcK that are prepared either in a single nuclear-spin sublevel or with equal populations in two sublevels. The measured temperature and nuclear-spin preparation dependence of rate coefficients agree well with calculations and reveal that rate coefficients for distinguishable atoms are only slightly enhanced over those of indistinguishable atoms. We further observe a suppression of excitation and losses during interrogation of the 1S 0-3P0 transition as density increases and Rabi frequency decreases, which suggests the presence of strong interactions in our dynamically driven many-body system. \u00a9 2011 American Physical Society.",

This advance necessitates\nunifying optical frequency comb technology with strong-field atomic physics.\nWhile strong-field studies of HHG have often focused on above-threshold\nharmonic generation (photon energy above the ionization potential), for VUV\nfrequency combs an understanding of below-threshold harmonic orders and their\ngeneration process is crucial. Here we present a new and quantitative study of\nthe harmonics 7-13 generated below and near the ionization threshold in xenon\ngas. We show multiple generation pathways for these harmonics that are\nmanifested as on-axis interference in the harmonic yield. This discovery\nprovides a new understanding of the strong-field, below-threshold dynamics\nunder the influence of an atomic potential and allows us to quantitatively\nassess the achievable coherence of a VUV frequency comb generated through below\nthreshold harmonics. We find that under reasonable experimental conditions\ntemporal coherence is maintained. As evidence we present the first explicit VUV\nfrequency comb structure beyond the 3rd harmonic.",

We apply TRFCS to study the time-resolved, mid-infrared absorption of the deuterated hydroxyformyl radical trans-DOCO, an important short-lived intermediate along the OD + CO reaction path. Directly after photolysis of the chemical precursor acrylic acid-d1, we measure absolute trans-DOCO product concentrations with a sensitivity of 5 \u00d7 10(10) cm(-3) and observe its subsequent loss with a time resolution of 25 \u03bcs. The multiplexed nature of TRFCS allows us to detect simultaneously the time-dependent concentration of several other photoproducts and thus unravel primary and secondary chemical reaction pathways.

        "abstract": "Many atomic and molecular systems of fundamental interest possess resonance frequencies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) where laser technology is limited and radiation sources have traditionally lacked long-term phase coherence. Recent breakthroughs in XUV frequency comb technology have demonstrated spectroscopy with unprecedented resolution at the megahertz level, but even higher resolutions are desired for future applications in precision measurement. By characterizing heterodyne beats between two XUV comb sources, we demonstrate the capability for sub-hertz spectral resolution. This corresponds to coherence times >1 s at photon energies up to 20 eV, more than six orders of magnitude longer than previously reported. This work establishes the ability of creating highly phase-stable radiation in the XUV with performance rivalling that of visible light. Furthermore, by direct sampling of the phase of the XUV light originating from high-harmonic generation, we demonstrate precise measurements of attosecond strong-field physics. Download references",

Sensitive intracavity absorption information is simultaneously available across 100 nanometers in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. Real-time, quantitative measurements were made of the trace presence, the transition strengths and linewidths, and the population redistributions due to collisions and the temperature changes for molecules such as C2H2, O2, H2O, and NH3.",

The example reported in this paper concerns hydroxyl radical (OH),\nwhich, after the internal degrees of freedom are cooled in a supersonic\nexpansion, has been bunched, accelerated, and slowed using time-varying\ninhomogeneous electric fields. In situ observations of laser-induced\nfluorescence along the beam propagation path allows for detailed\ncharacterization of the longitudinal phase-space manipulation of OH molecules\nby the electric fields. The creation of a pulse containing 1e3 to 1e6 molecules\npossessing a longitudinal velocity spread from 2 to 80 m/s around a mean\nlaboratory velocity variable from 550 m/s to rest with only a few mm spatial\nextent represents an exciting and useful new experimental capability for\nexploring free radical dynamics. This paper offers the most detailed study of\nthe Stark deceleration dynamics to date.",

This fundamental prototype reaction plays an important role in atmospheric and combustion chemistry, motivating studies for accurate determination of the reaction rate coefficient and its pressure and temperature dependence at thermal reaction conditions. This intricate dependence can be traced directly to details of the underlying dynamics (formation, isomerization, and dissociation) involving the reactive intermediates - and -HOCO, which can only be observed transiently. Using time-resolved frequency comb spectroscopy, comprehensive mechanistic elucidation of the kinetics of the isotopic analog deuteroxyl radical (OD) with CO has been realized. By monitoring the concentrations of reactants, intermediates, and products in real time, the branching and isomerization kinetics and absolute yields of all species in the OD + CO reaction are quantified as a function of pressure and collision partner.",

The parametric oscillator is pumped by 532-nm light and produces near-degenerate signal and idler fields. The modulator generates a comb structure about both the signal and the idler. Coupling between the two families of modes results in a dispersion-limited comb that spans 20 nm (5.3 THz).

This has resulted in rapidly growing interest in controlling the phase of the underlying carrier wave with respect to the envelope. The carrier-envelope phase is normally not important in optics; however, for such ultrafast pulses it can have physical consequences. Concurrently, modelocked lasers, which generate trains of ultrashort pulses, have become an important tool in optical frequency measurement. There is a close connection between these two apparently disparate topics. We have exploited this connection to develop a frequency domain technique that stabilizes the carrier phase with respect to the pulse envelope. Using the same technique, we performed absolute optical frequency measurements using a single modelocked laser with the only input being a stable microwave clock.",

The ISB are a manifestation of the strong interactions that occur between atoms confined in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry and disappear when the confinement is relaxed along one dimension. The emergence of ISB is linked to the recently observed suppression of collisional frequency shifts. At the current temperatures, the ISB can be resolved but are broad. At lower temperatures, ISB are predicted to be substantially narrower and useful spectroscopic tools in strongly interacting alkaline-earth gases.",

        "abstract": "The development of the optical frequency comb (a spectrum consisting of a series of evenly spaced lines) has revolutionized metrology and precision spectroscopy owing to its ability to provide a precise and direct link between microwave and optical frequencies. A further advance in frequency comb technology is the generation of frequency combs in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral range by means of high-harmonic generation in a femtosecond enhancement cavity. Until now, combs produced by this method have lacked sufficient power for applications, a drawback that has also hampered efforts to observe phase coherence of the high-repetition-rate pulse train produced by high-harmonic generation, which is an extremely nonlinear process. Here we report the generation of extreme-ultraviolet frequency combs, reaching wavelengths of 40\u2009nanometres, by coupling a high-power near-infrared frequency comb to a robust femtosecond enhancement cavity. These combs are powerful enough for us to observe single-photon spectroscopy signals for both an argon transition at 82\u2009nanometres and a neon transition at 63\u2009nanometres, thus confirming the combs' coherence in the extreme ultraviolet. The absolute frequency of the argon transition has been determined by direct frequency comb spectroscopy. The resolved ten-megahertz linewidth of the transition, which is limited by the temperature of the argon atoms, is unprecedented in this spectral region and places a stringent upper limit on the linewidth of individual comb teeth. Owing to the lack of continuous-wave lasers, extreme-ultraviolet frequency combs are at present the only promising route to extending ultrahigh-precision spectroscopy to the spectral region below 100\u2009nanometres. At such wavelengths there is a wide range of applications, including the spectroscopy of electronic transitions in molecules, experimental tests of bound-state and many-body quantum electrodynamics in singly ionized helium and neutral helium, the development of next-generation 'nuclear' clocks and searches for variation of fundamental constants using the enhanced sensitivity of highly charged ions.",

Due to the finite physical dimension of the electrode array and practical limitations of the applicable electric fields, only molecules within a specific range of velocities and positions can be efficiently slowed and trapped. These constraints result in a restricted phase space acceptance of the decelerator in directions both transverse and parallel to the molecular beam axis; hence, careful modeling is required for understanding and achieving efficient Stark decelerator operation. We present work on slowing of the hydroxyl radical (OH) elucidating the physics controlling the evolution of the molecular phase space packets both with experimental results and model calculations. From these results we deduce experimental conditions necessary for efficient operation of a Stark decelerator.",

This mixing technique is used in conjunction with a frequency modulated and chirped continuous wave laser to slow longitudinally a cryogenic buffer-gas beam of YO. We generate a flux of YO below 10 m/s, directly loadable into a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap. This technique opens the door for laser cooling of diatomic molecules with more complex loss channels due to intermediate states.",

We consider the incoherent thermal nature of the scattering process\nin a trap and show that coherent manipulations of the atomic ensemble, such as\nadiabatic passage, are feasible if performed within the coherence time window\ndictated by the temperature, which is relatively long for cold atoms. We show\nthat a sequence of ~2*10^7 pulses of moderate intensities, each lasting ~750\nns, can photoassociate a large fraction of the atomic ensemble at temperature\nof 100 microkelvin and density of 10^{11} atoms/cm^3. Use of multiple pulse\nsequences makes it possible to populate the ground vibrational state. Employing\nspontaneous decay from a selected excited state, one can accumulate the\nmolecules in a narrow distribution of vibrational states in the ground\nelectronic potential. Alternatively, by removing the created molecules from the\nbeam path between pulse sets, one can create a low-density ensemble of\nmolecules in their ground ro-vibrational state.",

        "abstract": "Optical lattice clocks with extremely stable frequency are possible when many atoms are interrogated simultaneously, but this precision may come at the cost of systematic inaccuracy resulting from atomic interactions. Density-dependent frequency shifts can occur even in a clock that uses fermionic atoms if they are subject to inhomogeneous optical excitation. However, sufficiently strong interactions can suppress collisional shifts in lattice sites containing more than one atom. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach with a strontium lattice clock by reducing both the collisional frequency shift and its uncertainty to the level of 10\u221217. This result eliminates the compromise between precision and accuracy in a many-particle system; both will continue to improve as the number of particles increases.",

A\nfemtosecond frequency comb is used to establish phase coherence between a pair\nof two-photon transitions in cold Rb atoms. By controlling the spectral phase\nof the frequency comb we demonstrate the optical phase sensitive response of\nthe diamond system. The high-resolution state selectivity of the comb is used\nto demonstrate the importance of the signs of dipole moment matrix elements in\nthis type of closed-loop excitation. Finally, the pulse shape is optimized\nresulting in a 256% increase in the two-photon transition rate by forcing\nconstructive interference between the mode pairs detuned from an intermediate\nresonance.",

        "abstract": "Precision measurements with ultracold molecules require development of robust\nand sensitive techniques to produce and interrogate the molecules. With this\ngoal, we theoretically analyze factors that affect frequency measurements\nbetween rovibrational levels of the Sr$_2$ molecule in the electronic ground\nstate. This measurement can be used to constrain the possible time variation of\nthe proton-electron mass ratio. Sr$_2$ is expected to be a strong candidate for\nachieving high precision due to the spinless nature and ease of cooling and\nperturbation-free trapping of Sr \\cite{Zelevinsky2008}. The analysis includes\ncalculations of two-photon transition dipole moments between deeply and weakly\nbound vibrational levels, lifetimes of intermediate excited states, and Stark\nshifts of the vibrational levels by the optical lattice field, including\npossibilities of Stark-cancellation trapping.",

The idler (signal)\nwavelength can be continuously tuned from 2.8 to 4.8 um (1.76 to 1.37 um) with\na simultaneous bandwidth as high as 0.3 um and a maximum average idler output\npower of 1.50 W.

We use a pulsed discharge to create OH from H 2 O seeded in Xe during a supersonic expansion, where the high-voltage pulse duration is significantly shorter than the width of the gas pulse. The pulsed discharge allows for control of the mean speed of the molecular packet as well as maintains a low temperature supersonic expansion. A hot filament is placed in the source chamber to initiate the discharge for shorter durations and at lower voltages, resulting in a translationally and rotationally colder packet of OH molecules.",

        "abstract": "Ultracold polar molecules, with their long-range electric dipolar interactions, offer a unique platform for studying correlated quantum many-body phenomena. However, realizing a highly degenerate quantum gas of molecules with a low entropy per particle is challenging. We report the synthesis of a low-entropy quantum gas of potassium-rubidium molecules (KRb) in a three-dimensional optical lattice. We simultaneously load into the optical lattice a Mott insulator of bosonic Rb atoms and a single-band insulator of fermionic K atoms. Then, using magnetoassociation and optical state transfer, we efficiently produce ground-state molecules in the lattice at those sites that contain one Rb and one K atom. The achieved filling fraction of 25% should enable future studies of transport and entanglement propagation in a many-body system with long-range dipolar interactions.",

We report on our development of precision tools for the lattice clock, including a stabilized clock laser with sub-Hz linewidth, fs-comb based technology allowing accurate clock comparison in both the microwave and optical domains, and clock transfer over optical fiber in an urban environment. High resolution spectroscopy (Q > 2 times 1014) of lattice confined strontium atoms is used for both a high-performance optical clock and atomic structure measurements. The current accuracy and stability of the lattice clock are also discussed.",

We report on our recent progress with a highly stable and accurate optical atomic clock based on ultracold fermionic 87Sr atoms confined in a one dimensional optical lattice. Currently, we have carried out a detailed evaluation of our clock at the 10-16 level and can report stability at 2 times 10-15 level at one second. At typical operating parameters for the clock we observe evidence of a density dependent clock shift. Operating the clock at a particular excitation ratio of ground state and excited clock state we observe a shift consistent with zero.",

        "abstract": "We implement imaging spectroscopy of the optical clock transition of lattice-trapped degenerate fermionic Sr in the Mott-insulating regime, combining micron spatial resolution with sub-millihertz spectral precision. We use these tools to demonstrate atomic coherence for up to 15 s on the clock transition and reach a record frequency precision of $2.5times 10^{-19}$. We perform the most rapid evaluation of trapping light shifts and record a 150 mHz linewidth, the narrowest Rabi lineshape observed on a coherent optical transition. The important emerging capability of combining high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy will improve the clock precision, and provide a path towards measuring many-body interactions and testing fundamental physics.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the effects of stimulated scattering of optical lattice photons on atomic coherence times in a state-of-the art ${}^{87}mathrm{Sr}$ optical lattice clock. Such scattering processes are found to limit the achievable coherence times to less than 10 s, significantly shorter than the predicted 145(40) s lifetime of ${}^{87}mathrm{Sr}$u0027s excited clock state. We suggest that shallow, state-independent optical lattices with increased lattice constants can give rise to sufficiently small lattice photon scattering and motional dephasing rates as to enable coherence times on the order of the clock transitionu0027s natural lifetime. Not only should this scheme be compatible with the relatively high atomic density associated with Fermi-degenerate gases in three-dimensional optical lattices, but we anticipate that certain properties of various quantum states of matter can be used to suppress dephasing due to tunneling.",

We use these tools to demonstrate atomic coherence for up to 15\u00a0s on the clock transition and reach a record frequency precision of 2.5\u00d710^{-19}. We perform the most rapid evaluation of trapping light shifts and record a 150\u00a0mHz linewidth, the narrowest Rabi line shape observed on a coherent optical transition. The important emerging capability of combining high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy will improve the clock precision, and provide a path towards measuring many-body interactions and testing fundamental physics.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important tasks in modern quantum science is to coherently control and entangle many-body systems, and to subsequently use these systems to realize powerful quantum technologies such as quantum-enhanced sensors. However, many-body entangled states are difficult to prepare and preserve since internal dynamics and external noise rapidly degrade any useful entanglement. Here, we introduce a protocol that counterintuitively exploits inhomogeneities, a typical source of dephasing in a many-body system, in combination with interactions to generate metrologically useful and robust many-body entangled states. Motivated by current limitations in state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice clocks (OLCs) operating at quantum degeneracy, we use local interactions in a Hubbard model with spin-orbit coupling to achieve a spin-locking effect. In addition to prolonging inter-particle spin coherence, spin-locking transforms the dephasing effect of spin-orbit coupling into a collective spin-squeezing process that can be further enhanced by applying a modulated drive. Our protocol is fully compatible with state-of-the-art 3D OLC interrogation schemes and may be used to improve their sensitivity, which is currently limited by the intrinsic quantum noise of independent atoms. We demonstrate that even with realistic experimental imperfections, our protocol may generate $sim10$--$14$ dB of spin squeezing in $sim1$ second with $sim10^2$--$10^4$ atoms. This capability exemplifies a new paradigm of using driven non-equilibrium systems to overcome current limitations in quantum metrology, allowing OLCs to enter a new regime of enhanced sensing with correlated quantum states.",

In this way we have performed a direct comparison of the 1S\u20142S transition in atomic hydrogen at 121 nm with a cesium fountain clock, built at the LPTF/Paris, to reach an accuracy of 1.9\u00d710-14. The same comb-line counting technique was exploited to determine and recalibrate several important optical frequency standards.\n In particular, the improved measurement of the Cesium D1 line is necessary for a more precise determination of the fine structure constant. In addition, several of the best-known\n optical frequency standards have been recalibrated via the fs method. By creating an octave-spanning frequency comb a single-laser\n frequency chain has been realized and tested.\n ",

The total number of molecules trapped is \u223c1.5\u00d710^{4}, with a temperature of 4.1(5)\u00a0mK. This diversifies the frontier of molecules that are laser coolable and paves the way for the second-stage narrow-line cooling in this molecule to the microkelvin regime. Futhermore, the new challenges of creating a 3D MOT of YO resolved here indicate that MOTs of more complex nonlinear molecules should be feasible as well.",

The SOC emerges naturally during the clock interrogation, when atoms are allowed to tunnel and accumulate a phase set by the ratio of the \"magic\" lattice wavelength to the clock transition wavelength. We demonstrate how standard protocols such as Rabi and Ramsey spectroscopy that take advantage of the sub-Hertz resolution of state-of-the-art clock lasers can perform momentum-resolved band tomography and determine SOC-induced s-wave collisions in nuclear-spin-polarized fermions. With the use of a second counterpropagating clock beam, we propose a method for engineering controlled atomic transport and study how it is modified by p- and s-wave interactions. The proposed spectroscopic probes provide clean and well-resolved signatures at current clock operating temperatures. ",

This laser performance is currently setting the limit for the stability of optical clocks. We demonstrate that single crystal silicon as resonator material can potentially reduce the thermal noise limit for optical cavities by an order of magnitude. We present an experimental realization of such a cavity where the spacer and the mirror substrates are both machined from single crystal silicon and operated at 124 K where the thermal expansion coefficient is zero. We present the setup and performance of this cavity. The stability was analyzed in a three-cornered-hat analysis of heterodyne beat signals among three independent stable lasers. The silicon cavity demonstrates a fractional frequency stability of 1 \u00d7 10-16 at short time scales and supports a world-record laser linewidth of <;40 mHz at 1.5 \u03bcm.",

        "abstract": "Crystalline optical cavities are the foundation of today\u2019s state-of-the-art ultrastable lasers. Building on our previous silicon cavity effort, we now achieve the fundamental thermal-noise-limited stability for a 6\u00a0cm long silicon cavity cooled to 4\u00a0K, reaching 6.5\u00d710\u221217 from 0.8\u00a0s to 80\u00a0s. We also report for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a clear linear dependence of the cavity frequency drift on incident optical power. The lowest fractional frequency drift of \u22123\u00d710\u221219/s is attained at a transmitted power of 40 nW, with an extrapolated drift approaching zero in the absence of optical power. These demonstrations provide a promising direction to reach a new performance domain for stable lasers, with stability better than 1\u00d710\u221217 and fractional linear drift below 1\u00d710\u221219/s.",

The coupling is\nmediated by the broad $5s5p \\phantom{}^1P_1$ state, exploiting the phenomenon\nof electromagnetically induced transparency. The effective linewidth of the\nclock transition can be chosen at will by adjusting the laser intensity. By\ntrapping the $^{88}$Sr atoms in an optical lattice, long interaction times with\nthe two lasers are ensured; Doppler and recoil effects are eliminated.

An absorption sensitivity of 1.2 x 10(-10) (1.8 x 10(-12)/cm) has been obtained. The absolute frequency of the line center is established (within +/-2.6 kHz) with respect to a doubled Nd:YAG laser/I(2) frequency reference. The short-term stability, limited by the available signal-to-noise ratio, currently is 1 + 10(-11) at 1 s, improving to 5 x 10(-13) at 1000 s. The measured pressure-broadening rate is 34.7(0.8) kHz/mTorr (260 +/- 6.1 kHz/Pa). Selection of slow molecules gave a linewidth four times narrower than the room-temperature transit-time limit.",

However, the very complexity that makes ultracold molecules so enticing has made reaching degeneracy an outstanding experimental challenge over the past decade. We now report the production of a degenerate Fermi gas of ultracold polar molecules of potassium-rubidium. Through coherent adiabatic association in a deeply degenerate mixture of a rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate and a potassium Fermi gas, we produce molecules at temperatures below 0.3 times the Fermi temperature. We explore the properties of this reactive gas and demonstrate how degeneracy suppresses chemical reactions, making a long-lived degenerate gas of polar molecules a reality.",

        "abstract": "We report improved stabilization results for and progress toward a more accurate frequency measurement of the 532 nm iodine-stabilized system based on a frequency-doubled Nd : YAG ring laser. We confirm the CCL-adopted frequency well within its stated uncertainty ( 40 kHz). HERE are a number of attractive metrological features of the green 532 nm light obtained by frequency-doubling the output of the commercially available stable Nd : YAG ring lasers. These advantages include high visibility, exceptionally low intrinsic frequency and amplitude noise levels, and the flexibility to realize various power levels as needed from submilliwatts to literally tens of watts. Because of the strong absorption and narrow linewidth of the I lines at 532 nm, it was realized early on that they form an almost ideal stabilization medium to complement the diode-pumped stable Nd : YAG laser. By now, groups at Stanford University (1) and JILA (2)-(4) have investigated a number of these features, including hyperfine structures, frequency intervals between several absorption lines (5), the absolute optical frequency, as well as some details of building an optical frequency standard based on this system. The 1997 meeting of Consultative Committee for Length (CCL) led to a recommended value for the optical frequency of one particular component, , of the R(56) 32-0 transition. A number of metrology groups have built stabilized laser systems based on these hyperfine resonances, and recently we have participated (6) in the first international intercomparison with the portable system \"Y1\" of the National Research Laboratory for Metrology (NRLM).",

The agreement between the two measurements is 330/spl plusmn/380 Hz, yielding a measurement uncertainty of 6.7/spl times/10/sup -13/ that is mainly contributed from the reproducibility of the portable laser. This comparison is used to confirm the measured absolute frequency of NMIJ-Y3, which is reported to the Consultative Committee for Length (CCL) for the determination of the frequency value of iodine-stabilized Nd:YAG lasers.",

She spent much of her career as a U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) physicist at JILA (formerly known as the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics) in Boulder, Colorado, where she undertook a string of challenging experiments, including the creation of the first Fermi gas of atoms and the formation of a condensate of paired fermions. She imbued all that she worked on with a sense of scientific vision, creativity, detail-oriented excellence, and old-fashioned hard work. Jin died of cancer on 15 September 2016 at the age of 47, a loss that leaves a void in the scientific community and is, for so many, the untimely loss of a colleague and friend.",

The more recent application of sophisticated cooling techniques to molecules, which has been more challenging to implement owing to the complexity of molecular structures, has now opened the door to the longstanding goal of precisely controlling molecular internal and external degrees of freedom and the resulting interaction processes. This line of research can leverage fundamental insights into how molecules interact and evolve to enable the control of reaction chemistry and the design and realization of a range of advanced quantum materials.",

The DR-OPO has the highest output power reported to date from a femtosecond, synchronously pumped OPO based on OP-GaAs. We observed strong three-photon absorption with a coefficient of 0.35\u00b10.08\u2009\u2009cm<sup>3</sup>/GW<sup>2</sup> for our OP-GaAs sample, which limits the output power of these OPOs as mid-IR light sources.

Complementing our recent work on quantifying the formation rate of the  trans -DOCO radical, we report measurements of the kinetics of the chemically activated product channel, D\u00a0+\u00a0CO 2 , at room temperature. Simultaneous measurements of the time-dependence of OD and CO 2  concentrations directly yield the products\u2019 formation rate and its dependence on pressure and bath gas. Together with the  trans -DOCO formation rate, these new measurements provide absolute yields of branching channels for both products of OD\u00a0+\u00a0CO in the low-pressure limit.",

        "abstract": "A high-intensity supersonic beam source has been a key component in studies of molecular collisions, molecule-surface interaction, chemical reactions, and precision spectroscopy. However, the molecular density available for experiments in a downstream science chamber is limited by skimmer clogging, which constrains the separation between a valve and a skimmer to at least several hundred nozzle diameters. A recent experiment (Sci. Adv., 2017, 3, e1602258) has introduced a new strategy to address this challenge: when a skimmer is cooled to a temperature below the freezing point of the carrier gas, skimmer clogging can be effectively suppressed. We go beyond this proof-of-principle work in several key ways. Firstly, we apply the skimmer cooling approach to discharge-produced radical and metastable beams entrained in a carrier gas. We also identify two different processes for skimmer clogging mitigation-shockwave suppression at temperatures around the carrier gas freezing point and diffusive clogging at even lower temperatures. With the carrier clogging removed, we now fully optimize the production of entrained species such as hydroxyl radicals, resulting in a gain of 30 in density over the best commercial devices. The gain arises from both clogging mitigation and favorable geometry with a much shorter valve-skimmer distance.",

        "abstract": "Objective Soil salinization is one of a major obstacle factors affecting crop yield in arid region. In this study,a field plot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of magnetized water irrigation on soil water infiltration and soil salt leaching under the drip irrigation condition. The purpose of our research is to find a novel method to reduce soil salt content and prevent soil secondary salinity in water-saving agriculture. MethodUsing in situ soil moisture sampler and collecting soil leachate in 2 m soil layer,a field experiment was set up,and three treatments including Control( CK).,one times magnetized water irrigation( T1).,two times magnetized water irrigation( T2).,soil water leachate,soil solution salt content and soil salt content were determined.ResultTotal salt content,and the content of Cl-and Na+of soil leachate variation trend was found as CK < T1< T2. Soil solution salt content in 60-100 cm layer was greatly higher under magnetized water irrigation treatment than that of the CK,suggesting that magnetized water irrigation played a significant role in soil infiltration and soil salt leaching. Moreover,in contrast to one time magnetized water irrigation treatment,an more obvious soil salt leaching effect was found under the treatment of two times magnetized water irrigation. For instance,the amounts of soil water leachate were 80. 27 kg,91. 39 kg and87. 99 kg,respectively,under CK,T1,T2treatment,compared with control( CK).,the amounts of soil water leachate were increased by 13. 9 % with T1 and increased by 9. 6 % with T2treatment. After the last water irrigation,soil Cl-concentration and soil Na+concentration in 0-100 cm soil layer decreased markedly,and the salt decreased degree order was CK < T1< T2. ConclusionFrom our study a conclusion could be drawn that magnetized water irrigation had a significant role in soil water infiltration as well as soil salt leaching in drip irrigation condition.",

In present research, simulating experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of different sand mixed rate on soil water infiltration and soil evaporation. The soil cylinder incubation treatments were setup including 0 (Control), 25%, 50%, 75% of sand mixing rate, respectively. There were extremely significant power relationships among wetting front distance, accumulated infiltration quantity and infiltration time under different mixing rate of sand treatments. The more sand mixed, the more soil water infiltration capacity observed, i. e., the infiltration capacity order was 75%>50%>25%>0. Moreover, by means of sand mixed with soil exerted obvious positive effects on inhibition of soil evaporation, namely, the more sand mixed, the remarkable less soil water evaporated, especially when sand mixed rate increased above 75%. The relationship between cumulative evaporation and time could be described by the Rose experience formula under different mixing rate of sand, and had closely fitting accuracy during the successive evaporation of 20 days. The soil moisture at deep layers which under sand mixed layer could also be remarkably enhanced by means of soil surface mixed with sand. The more mixing rate of sand, the remarkable higher soil water content obtained.",

        "title": "Drip irrigation with suitable saline water improves water use efficiency for cotton",
        "abstract": "The scarcity of fresh water in arid regions makes saline water a valuable alternative water source for irrigation. In this study, field experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of saline water irrigation on growth, yield and water use efficiency of cotton plants (Gossypium hirsutum L.), as well as plant and soil 15N recovery. Three irrigation water salinity levels were designed as 0.35, 4.61 and 8.04 dS/m, representing fresh water (FW), brackish water (BW), and saline water (SW), respectively. Two irrigation amounts were set as 405 mm (I405) and 540 mm (I540) under each irrigation water salinity treatment. Overall, the dry matter weight, N uptake, and yield of cotton increased with irrigation amount increasing from 405 mm to 540 mm, but there were differences under different water salinity treatments. The highest dry matter weight of cotton was found under the BW treatment, which was 9.6% and 20.2% higher than that under the FW and SW treatments, respectively. Plant N uptake and yield under SW treatment was significantly lower than that under FW treatments, but there were no significant difference between the BW and FW treatments. The ET of cotton field increased with irrigation amount increased, but decreased with water salinity increasing from 0.35 dS/m to 4.61 dS/m, and to 8.04 dS/m. BW had the similar ET with FW, but ET was significantly reduced under SW treatment. The water productivity of cotton and the water productivity of irrigation under different treatments ranged from 0.70 to 1.02 kg/m3 and from 0.79 to 1.16 kg/m3, respectively. The water productivity of cotton and the water productivity of irrigation were significantly higher in BW and FW than the SW treatment. The result of 15N Isotopes tracer experiment showed that the plant 15N recovery under the I540 treatments was on average 7.51% higher than that under I405 treatments. The soil 15N recovery was reduced with 13.20% and 15N leaching percentage was increased with 29.47% when irrigation amount increasing from 405 mm to 540 mm. The plant 15N recovery under various treatments ranged from 47.02% to 59.86% under different water salinity treatments. The plant 15N recovery under the SW treatment was 10.17% and 15.23% lower than that under the FW and BW treatments, respectively. The soil 15N recovery under various treatments ranged from 16.75% to 22.14% and was slightly affected by the water salinity. The total recovery of 15N in plants and soils under different treatments ranged from 68.9% to 76.6% with an average of 72.2%. The total recovery of 15N was higher in BW and FW than the SW treatment. The 15N leaching percentage ranged from 1.56% to 4.71% for different treatments and was significantly affected by the water salinity. The 15N leaching percentage was significantly higher in SW and BW than the FW treatment, representing 80.53% and 136.00% increase, respectively. Those results suggest that the yield, water use efficiency, and 15N recovery of cotton are not affected by brackish water with an optimum salinity level and irrigation amount. Saline water irrigation could cause cotton yield, water use efficiency, and nitrogen use efficiency decreased significantly. Nitrogen leaching is one of the major ways of N loss in cotton field under drip irrigation conditions. Saline water and brackish water irrigation may increase the risk of N leaching loss from the root zone. Therefore, minimizing the N leaching loss is very important for promoting N fertilizer use efficiency in cotton field under drip irrigation with saline water.",

        "abstract": "Ammonium and nitrate are the main forms of available nitrogen(N) for plant.Nitrate is the dominant form of N in up-land soils in arid regions.However,nitrate can easily leach through soil profiles.Furthermore,N can easily be lost in the form of NOx via(de)nitrification.Inhibiting the processes of nitrification in soil through nitrification inhibitors is therefore critical for optimizing soil NH4+/NO3 ratio and improving the efficiency of N fertilizers.As one of the most common nitrification inhibitors,dicyandiamide(DCD) was applied at different rates(0%,1.0%,2.0%,3.0%,3.5%,4.0%,4.5%,5.0%,6.0% and 7.0% of applied N) in this study.And incubation experiment was conducted in sandy,loamy and clayey desert soils at 25 ?C to investigate the inhibition effect,dose-dependent effects of DCD on soil nitrification in arid regions.The study may further enhance our existing knowledge on the mechanisms of DCD inhibited nitrification.The results showed that during 30 days of incubation,DCD exhibited significant inhibi-tion effects on nitrification in all the tested soil types.Nitrification inhibition rates were 96.5%\uff5e99.4% in sandy soil,66.9%\uff5e85.6% in clayey soil and 49.3%\uff5e79.4% in loamy soil.For the three soil types,DCD nitrification inhibition efficacy was in the following order: sandy soil > clayey soil > loamy soil.When DCD application rate increased from 1.0% to 7.0% of applied nitrogen,nitrate concen-tration in sandy soil merely increased from 1.9 to 10.7 mg\u00b7kg 1.This suggested that DCD dose did not significantly affect nitrification in sandy soils.However,soil nitrate concentration in loamy and clayey soils decreased sharply with increasing rates of DCD,indi-cating significant dose effect on soil nitrification.In conclusion,DCD significantly inhibited soil nitrification in calcareous desert soils.The recommended optimum application rates of DCD in sandy,clayey and loamy soils were 6.0%,7.0% and 7.0% of applied nitrogen,respectively.",

In the present study, two in vitro angiogenesis assays were compared to evaluate the effects of netrin-1 secreted by retrovirally transduced melanoma cells (Mel2a-netrin1) on tube formation. The results showed that there was no obvious difference in tube formation induced by conditioned media (CM) from the control, Mel2a-netrin1 and Mel2a cells in a matrigel assay. The results of another in vitro assay, in which endothelial cells were co-cultured with human fibroblasts, however, showed that Mel2a-netrin1 CM inhibited the tube formation, supposedly through blocking the elongation and coalescence of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These results confirmed that the matrigel assay is not able to demonstrate the anti-angiogenic roles of netrin-1.",

        "abstract": "The site-specific recombination mediated by Cre recombinase has been utilized extensively in genetic engineering and gene function studies. Efficient delivery of a Cre enzyme with enzymatic activity and the ability to monitor the enzyme expression are required in applications, and lentiviral constructs with a fluorescent protein (FP) to report the Cre expression are suitable for most studies. However, the current lentiviral vector systems have some deficiencies in precise reporting the Cre expression through fluorescence. To solve the problem, we generated a lentiviral system with Cre and RFP or EGFP bridged by an FMDV 2A sequence in an open reading frame expressed by a CMV promoter. We then examined the capabilities of the constructs to package with VSVG into infectious virus and to mediate expression of the Cre enzyme and fluorescent reporter. Furthermore, we monitored the bioactivities of the expressed products. We demonstrated the coordinate expression of the enzyme and the reporter. The expressed Cre was efficient at removing LoxP-flanked fragments in cells and did not show obvious cellular toxicity, and the expressed FPs allowed direct observation under fluorescent microscope. Therefore, the conjugation of CMV-Cre-2A-FP represents a significant improvement to the current lentiviral Cre delivery systems for obtaining a required Cre activity while accurately monitoring its presence. Our study also provides information concerning application of the established vector system.",

Based on the weighted cosine measure of SVNMs, a multiple attribute decision-making method under a SVNM environment is proposed, in which the evaluated values of alternatives are taken in the form of SVNMs. The ranking order of all alternatives and the best one can be determined by the weighted cosine measure between every alternative and the ideal alternative.

Then, projection measure is a very suitable tool for dealing with multiple attribute decision-making problems because it can consider not only the distance but also the included angle between objects evaluated. Therefore, the main purpose of the paper is to present a simplified neutrosophic harmonic averaging projection measure and its multiple attribute decision making method with simplified neutrosophic information. Through the harmonic averaging projection measure between each alternative and the ideal alternative, the ranking order of all alternatives can be determined and the best alternative can be easily obtained as well. Finally, an illustrative example demonstrates the application and effectiveness of the proposed projection measure method in a simplified neutrosophic multiple attribute decision-making environment.",

However, their aggregated values imply some unreasonable results in some cases. To overcome the shortcomings, this paper proposes an intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid weighted arithmetic and geometric aggregation (IFHWAGA) operator and an intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid ordered weighted arithmetic and geometric aggregation (IFHOWAGA) operator and discusses their suitability by numerical examples. Then, we propose a multiple attribute decision-making method of mechanical design schemes based on the IFHWAGA or IFHOWAGA operator under an intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Finally, a decision-making problem regarding the mechanical design schemes of press machine is provided as a case to show the application of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In real world, there exists determinate and/or indeterminate information. Hence, the indeterminate problems are inevitable and have to be taken into account in optimization problems. Then, a neutrosophic number (NN) is very suitable for expressing determinate and/or indeterminate information because a NN (\\(z=a + bI\\)) consists of its determinate part a and its indeterminate part bI for \\(a,b\\in R\\), where the symbol \u201cI\u201d denotes indeterminacy and R is all real numbers. This paper firstly presents some basic operations of NNs and a neutrosophic function involving NNs, which is simply called a NN function and then develops a NN linear programming (NNLP) method to handle NN optimization problems. Moreover, a numerical example and an application of production planning are provided, respectively, to show the solving method and application of NNLP problems. In general, the NNLP method yields the basic NN solutions. Further, the possible ranges of the optimal solution are discussed when the indeterminacy I is specified as a possible interval ranges corresponding to actual requirements in real applications.",

        "abstract": "The linguistic neutrosophic numbers (LNNs) can express the truth, indeterminacy, and falsity degrees independently by three linguistic variables. Hence, they are an effective tool for describing indeterminate linguistic information under linguistic decision-making environments. Similarity measures are usual tools in decision-making problems. However, existing cosine similarity measures have been applied in decision-making problems, but they cannot deal with linguistic information under linguistic decision-making environments. To deal with the issue, we propose two cosine similarity measures based on distance and the included angle cosine of two vectors between LNNs. Then, we establish a multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method based on the cosine similarity measures under an LNN environment. Finally, a practical example about the decision-making problems of investment alternatives is presented to demonstrate the effective applications of the proposed MAGDM method under an LNN environment.",

        "abstract": "The existing neutrosophic linguistic decision-making approach uses only one neutrosophic linguistic number (NLN) to express its evaluation value of an attribute in decision making. Sometimes, it may not reflect exactly what decision makers mean due to the ambiguity and indeterminacy of their cognitions to complex decision-making problems. In this situation, decision makers might hesitate among several NLNs to express their opinions. To deal with the issue, this paper defines hesitant neutrosophic linguistic numbers (HNLNs), the expected value of HNLN and proposes the generalized distance and similarity measure between two HNLN sets based on the least common multiple cardinality for HNLNs. Then, multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) methods are established based on the expected value and the similarity measure under a HNLN environment. In the proposed decision-making methods, the evaluation values of alternatives over attributes provided by decision makers are HNLNs, and then all the alternatives are ranked by the expected values of HNLNs and the similarity measure values between each alternative and the ideal alternative (ideal solution) to select the best one. An actual example on the selection problem of manufacturing alternatives is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the developed decision-making approaches. The decision results of manufacturing alternatives and the comparative analysis indicate that the proposed methods are effective and superior to existing ones. The MADM methods based on the expected value and the similarity measure can effectively deal with MADM problems with HNLN information and are more objective and more useful than the existing ones.",

        "abstract": "Visual object tracking is a critical task in computer vision. Challenging things always exist when an object needs to be tracked. For instance, background clutter is one of the most challenging problems. The mean-shift tracker is quite popular because of its efficiency and performance in a range of conditions. However, the challenge of background clutter also disturbs its performance. In this article, we propose a novel weighted histogram based on neutrosophic similarity score to help the mean-shift tracker discriminate the target from the background. Neutrosophic set (NS) is a new branch of philosophy for dealing with incomplete, indeterminate, and inconsistent information. In this paper, we utilize the single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS), which is a subclass of NS to improve the mean-shift tracker. First, two kinds of criteria are considered as the object feature similarity and the background feature similarity, and each bin of the weight histogram is represented in the SVNS domain via three membership functions T(Truth), I(indeterminacy), and F(Falsity). Second, the neutrosophic similarity score function is introduced to fuse those two criteria and to build the final weight histogram. Finally, a novel neutrosophic weighted mean-shift tracker is proposed. The proposed tracker is compared with several mean-shift based trackers on a dataset of 61 public sequences. The results revealed that our method outperforms other trackers, especially when confronting background clutter.",

        "abstract": "Based on dynamic information collected from different time intervals in some real situations, this paper firstly proposes a dynamic single valued neutrosophic multiset (DSVNM) to express dynamic information and operational relations of DSVNMs. Then, a correlation coefficient between DSVNMs and a weighted correlation coefficient between DSVNMs are presented to measure the correlation degrees between DSVNMs, and their properties are investigated. Based on the weighted correlation coefficient of DSVNMs, a multiple attribute decision-making method is established under a DSVNM environment, in which the evaluation values of alternatives with respect to attributes are collected from different time intervals and are represented by the form of DSVNMs. The ranking order of alternatives is performed through the weighted correlation coefficient between an alternative and the ideal alternative, which is considered by the attribute weights and the time weights, and thus the best one(s) can also be determined. Finally, a practical example shows the application of the proposed method.",

It is a powerful structure in expressing indeterminate and inconsistent information. However, there has only been one paper until now\u2014to the best of my knowledge\u2014on the subtraction and division operators in the basic operational laws of neutrosophic single-valued numbers defined in existing literature. Therefore, this paper proposes subtraction operation and division operation for simplified neutrosophic sets, including single valued neutrosophic sets and interval neutrosophic sets respectively, under some constrained conditions to form the integral theoretical framework of simplified neutrosophic sets. In addition, we give numerical examples to illustrate the defined operations. The subtraction and division operations are very important in many practical applications, such as decision making and image processing.",

However, existing refined single-valued/interval neutrosophic similarity measures and their decision-making methods are scarcely studied in existing literature and cannot deal with this decision-making problem with the weights of both attributes and sub-attributes in a refined interval and/or single-valued neutrosophic setting. To solve the issue, this paper firstly introduces a refined simplified neutrosophic set (RSNS), which contains the refined single-valued neutrosophic set (RSVNS) and refined interval neutrosophic set (RINS), and then proposes vector similarity measures of RSNSs based on the Jaccard, Dice, and cosine measures of simplified neutrosophic sets in vector space, and the weighted Jaccard, Dice, and cosine measures of RSNSs by considering weights of both basic elements and sub-elements in RSNS. Further, a decision-making method with the weights of both attributes and sub-attributes is developed based on the weighted Jaccard, Dice, and cosine measures of RSNSs under RSNS (RINS and/or RSVNS) environments. The ranking order of all the alternatives and the best one can be determined by one of weighted vector similarity measures between each alternative and the ideal solution (ideal alternative).

        "abstract": "As an extension of an intuitionistic fuzzy set, a single-valued neutrosophic set is described independently by the membership functions of its truth, indeterminacy, and falsity, which is a subclass of a neutrosophic set (NS). However, in existing exponential operations and their aggregation methods for neutrosophic numbers (NNs) (basic elements in NSs), the exponents (weights) are positive real numbers in unit intervals under neutrosophic decision-making environments. As a supplement, this paper defines new exponential operations of single-valued NNs (basic elements in a single-valued NS), where positive real numbers are used as the bases, and single-valued NNs are used as the exponents. Then, we propose a single-valued neutrosophic weighted exponential aggregation (SVNWEA) operator based on the exponential operational laws of single-valued NNs and the SVNWEA operator-based decision-making method. Finally, an illustrative example shows the applicability and rationality of the presented method. A comparison with a traditional method demonstrates that the new decision-making method is more appropriate and effective.",

Although the Dombi operations have been extended to many studies to solve decision-making problems; the Dombi operations are not used for linguistic cubic variables (LCVs) so far. Hence, the Dombi operations of LCVs are firstly presented in this paper. A linguistic cubic variable Dombi weighted arithmetic average (LCVDWAA) operator and a linguistic cubic variable Dombi weighted geometric average (LCVDWGA) operator are proposed to aggregate LCVs. Then a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) method is developed in LCV setting on the basis of LCVDWAA and LCVDWGA operators.

In these cases, we cannot always compute or provide exact/crisp values for the joint roughness coefficient (JRC), which is a quite crucial parameter for determining the shear strength in rock mechanics, but we need to approximate them. Hence, we need to investigate the anisotropy and scale effect of indeterminate JRC values by neutrosophic number (NN) functions, because the NN is composed of its determinate part and the indeterminate part and is very suitable for the expression of JRC data with determinate and/or indeterminate information. In this study, the lower limit of JRC data is chosen as the determinate information, and the difference between the lower and upper limits is chosen as the indeterminate information. In this case, the NN functions of the anisotropic ellipse and logarithmic equation of JRC are developed to reflect the anisotropy and scale effect of JRC values. Additionally, the NN parameter \u03c8 is defined to quantify the anisotropy of JRC values. Then, a two-variable NN function is introduced based on the factors of both the sample size and measurement orientation. Further, the changing rates in various sample sizes and/or measurement orientations are investigated by their derivative and partial derivative NN functions. However, an actual case study shows that the proposed NN functions are effective and reasonable in the expression and analysis of the indeterminate values of JRC. Obviously, NN functions provide a new, effective way for passing from the classical crisp expression and analyses to the neutrosophic ones.",

        "abstract": "In rock mechanics, the study of shear strength on the structural surface is crucial to evaluating the stability of engineering rock mass. In order to determine the shear strength, a key parameter is the joint roughness coefficient (JRC). To express and analyze JRC values, Ye et al. have proposed JRC neutrosophic numbers (JRC-NNs) and fitting functions of JRC-NNs, which are obtained by the classical statistics and curve fitting in the current method. Although the JRC-NNs and JRC-NN functions contain much more information (partial determinate and partial indeterminate information) than the crisp JRC values and functions in classical methods, the JRC functions and the JRC-NN functions may also lose some useful information in the fitting process and result in the function distortion of JRC values. Sometimes, some complex fitting functions may also result in the difficulty of their expressions and analyses in actual applications. To solve these issues, we can combine the neutrosophic numbers with neutrosophic statistics to realize the neutrosophic statistical analysis of JRC-NNs for easily analyzing the characteristics (scale effect and anisotropy) of JRC values. In this study, by means of the neutrosophic average values and standard deviations of JRC-NNs, rather than fitting functions, we directly analyze the scale effect and anisotropy characteristics of JRC values based on an actual case. The analysis results of the case demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed neutrosophic statistical analysis of JRC-NNs and can overcome the insufficiencies of the classical statistics and fitting functions. The main advantages of this study are that the proposed neutrosophic statistical analysis method not only avoids information loss but also shows its simplicity and effectiveness in the characteristic analysis of JRC.",

        "abstract": "Many studies have been carried out to investigate the scale effect on the shear behavior of rock joints. However, existing methods are difficult to determinate the joint roughness coefficient (JRC) and the shear strength of rock joints with incomplete and indeterminate information; the nature of scale dependency of rock joints is still unknown and remains an ongoing debate. Thus, this paper establishes two neutrosophic functions of the JRC values and the shear strength based on neutrosophic theory to express and handle the incomplete and indeterminate problems in the analyses of the JRC and the shear strength. An example, including four rock joint samples derived from the pyroclastic rock mass in Shaoxing city, China, is provided to show the effectiveness and rationality of the developed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neutrosophic functions can express and deal with the incomplete and indeterminate problems of the test data caused by geometry complexity of the rock joint surface and sampling bias. They provide a new approach for estimating the JRC values of the different-sized test profiles and the peak shear strength of rock joints.",

The limit equilibrium method is generally utilized in the stability analysis of rock slope with single failure plane. However, the stratified rock slope cannot be accurately estimated by this method because of different bedding planes and their variable shear strength parameters. Based on the idealized model of rock slope with bedding planes, a modified limiting equilibrium method is presented to determine the potential sliding surface and the factor of safety for the stratified rock slope. In this method, the S-curve model is established to define the spatial variations of the shear strength parameters  and\u2009\u2009 of bedding plane and the tensile strength of rock mass. This method was applied in the stability evaluation of typical stratified rock slope in Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China.

The JRC values of rock joints are typically measured by visual comparison against Barton\u2019s standard JRC profiles. However, its accuracy is strongly affected by personal bias. In the present study, a new comparison method is proposed for JRC evaluation to overcome the drawback of conventional visual comparison methods based on vector similarity measures (VSMs). The feature vectors are obtained by analyzing the angular variation of line segments of both standard JRC profiles and test profiles obtained from three kinds of natural rocks with a sampling interval of 0.5 mm. The roughness similarity degrees between test profiles and standard profiles are evaluated by the Jaccard, Dice, and cosine similarity measures. The JRC values of the test profiles are then determined according to the maximum relation index based on the similarity degrees. In the present study, a comparative analysis between the VSMs method and the JRC evaluation method using different roughness parameters demonstrated that the VSMs method is effective and accurate for JRC measurement.",

The large-scale natural rock joint surfaces, at Qingshi Town, southeast of Changshan County, Zhejiang Province, China, were used as a case study to analyze the roughness characteristics. A statistical assessment of joint roughness coefficient (JRC) indicated the roughness anisotropy of different sized rock joints. The lower limit () was regarded as the determinate information, and the difference between lower and upper limits represented indeterminate information. The neutrosophic number (NN) was calculated to express the various JRC values. The parametric equations for JRC anisotropic ellipse were presented based on the JRC statistical assessment of joint profiles of various orientations. The JRC values of different sized joint samples were then quantitatively described by the neutrosophic function. Finally, a neutrosophic parameter  for evaluating the scale effect on the surface roughness anisotropy was introduced using the ratio of maximum directional roughness to minimum directional roughness. The case study indicates that the proposed method has the superiority in moving forward from subjective assessment to quantitative and objective analysis on anisotropy characteristic and scale effect of joint surface roughness.",

        "abstract": "Neutrosophic set (NS) is a new branch of philosophy to deal with the origin, nature, and scope of neutralities. Many kinds of correlation coefficients and similarity measures have been proposed in neutrosophic domain. In this work, by considering that there may exist different contributions for the neutrosophic elements of T (Truth), I (Indeterminacy), and F (Falsity), a method of element-weighted neutrosophic correlation coefficient is proposed, and it is applied for improving the CAMShift tracker in RGBD (RGB-Depth) video. The concept of object seeds is proposed, and it is employed for extracting object region and calculating the depth back-projection. Each candidate seed is represented in the single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) domain via three membership functions, T, I, and F. Then the element-weighted neutrosophic correlation coefficient is applied for selecting robust object seeds by fusing three kinds of criteria. Moreover, the proposed correlation coefficient is applied for estimating a robust back-projection by fusing the information in both color and depth domains. Finally, for the scale adaption problem, two alternatives in the neutrosophic domain are proposed, and the corresponding correlation coefficient between the proposed alternative and the ideal one is employed for the identification of the scale. When considering challenging factors like fast motion, blur, illumination variation, deformation, and camera jitter, the experimental results revealed that the improved CAMShift tracker performs well.",

        "abstract": "Neural networks are powerful universal approximation tools. They have been utilized for functions/data approximation, classification, pattern recognition, as well as their various applications. Uncertain or interval values result from the incompleteness of measurements, human observation and estimations in the real world. Thus, a neutrosophic number (NsN) can represent both certain and uncertain information in an indeterminate setting and imply a changeable interval depending on its indeterminate ranges. In NsN settings, however, existing interval neural networks cannot deal with uncertain problems with NsNs. Therefore, this original study proposes a neutrosophic compound orthogonal neural network (NCONN) for the first time, containing the NsN weight values, NsN input and output, and hidden layer neutrosophic neuron functions, to approximate neutrosophic functions/NsN data. In the proposed NCONN model, single input and single output neurons are the transmission notes of NsN data and hidden layer neutrosophic neurons are constructed by the compound functions of both the Chebyshev neutrosophic orthogonal polynomial and the neutrosophic sigmoid function. In addition, illustrative and actual examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and learning performance of the proposed NCONN model for approximating neutrosophic nonlinear functions and NsN data. The contribution of this study is that the proposed NCONN can handle the approximation problems of neutrosophic nonlinear functions and NsN data. However, the main advantage is that the proposed NCONN implies a simple learning algorithm, higher speed learning convergence, and higher learning accuracy in indeterminate/NsN environments.",

However, a few researchers have studied neutrosophic cubic decision-making problems, where the similarity measure of NCSs is one of the useful measure methods. For this work, we propose the Dice, cotangent, and Jaccard measures between NCSs, and indicate their properties. Then, under an NCS environment, the similarity measures-based decision-making method of multiple attributes is developed.

Under a simplified neutrosophic environment, therefore, this paper firstly defines simplified neutrosophic asymmetry measures. Then we propose a normalized symmetry measure and a weighted symmetry measure of simplified neutrosophic sets and develop a simplified neutrosophic multiple attribute decision-making method based on the weighted symmetry measure. All alternatives can be ranked through the weighted symmetry measure between the ideal solution/alternative and each alternative, and then the best one can be determined. Finally, an illustrative example on the selection of manufacturing schemes (alternatives) in the flexible manufacturing system demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method in a simplified (interval and single valued) neutrosophic setting, and then the decision-making method based on the proposed symmetry measure is in accord with the ranking order and best choice of existing projection and bidirectional projection-based decision-making methods and strengthens the resolution/discrimination in the decision-making process corresponding to the comparative example.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PC) is more common cancer in older men. Then, the existing evaluation method of PC risk grades is based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging/scoring system. It utilizes the comprehensive risk data of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, Gleason score, and T staging score as the evaluation criteria of PC patients. However, these risk data of PC patients not only may belong to different risk grades simultaneously to result in the unreasonable and uncertain evaluation results to some extent, but also may lose useful fuzzy and uncertain information in the existing evaluation method with non-fuzzy information. To overcome these insufficiencies, the research problems in this study are: (a) to present a new concept of a cubic hesitant fuzzy set (CHFS) for expressing uncertain and hesitant fuzzy information; (b) to propose the generalized distance and similarity measure between CHFSs; (c) to establish a comprehensive evaluation method of PC risk grades with CHFS information by using the similarity measure of CHFSs; and (d) to provide the evaluation examples of PC patients as actual clinical cases for indicating the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed risk evaluation method. Then, the main contribution of this original study is that we present a new concept of CHFS to express uncertain and hesitant information of PC risk grades and the generalized distance-based similarity measure of CHFSs to establish a comprehensive evaluation method of PC risk grades. Finally, by the 16 evaluation examples of the PC patients, all their evaluation results verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed comprehensive evaluation method. The comparative analysis demonstrates that its evaluation performance is superior to that of the existing evaluation method of PC risk grades.",

        "abstract": "In order to give the initial evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms regarding a patient, physician usually performs the clinical inquiry of the patient, whereas his/her responses may contain hesitant fuzzy and uncertain information. However, existing evaluation/diagnosis approaches of BPH symptoms cannot cope with the hybrid problem of both hesitant and uncertain responses of patients. Furthermore, existing evaluation approaches may lose some useful responses (e.g. hesitant fuzzy information) so as to result in the unreasonable or indeterminate evaluation/diagnosis in the evaluation process of patients. To overcome this insufficiency, this study firstly introduces the concept of a cubic hesitant fuzzy set (CHFS) based on combining uncertain/interval-valued fuzzy information with hesitant fuzzy information so as to express the hybrid fuzzy information and proposes the Dice measure between CHFSs based on the extension method of the least common multiple cardinality/number (LCMC) for the hesitant fuzzy sets in CHFS. Then, the initial evaluation approach of BPH symptoms is developed by using the Dice measure of CHFSs. Lastly, the assessment results of six BPH patients are presented as the clinical actual cases to indicate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed assessment approach in CHFS setting. The comparison with existing common evaluation methods shows that the developed evaluation/diagnosis method is superior to the existing common evaluation methods in the evaluation/diagnosis process of the clinical actual cases.",

        "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs have been shown to have critical regulatory roles in cancer biology. However, the contributions of lncRNAs to gastric cancer remain largely unknown.The differential expression of lncRNAs in gastric cancer and paired non-cancerous tissues were identified by microarray and validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Gastric samples from patients with gastric cancer were further analyzed for levels of a specifically downregulated lncRNA (termed as LEIGC).We found that there were significantly lower levels of LEIGC expression in cancer tissue than in adjacent non-cancerous tissues in human gastric cancers (P\u2009&amp;lt;\u20090.01). Overexpression of LEIGC suppressed tumor growth and cell proliferation, and enhanced the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), whereas knockdown of LEIGC showed the opposite effect. We further demonstrated LEIGC functions by inhibiting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer.Our data suggested that LEIGC is a tumor-suppressing lncRNA in gastric cancer, and led us to propose that lncRNAs may play important regulatory roles in cancer development and progression.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, the effects of evodiamine on the apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells was studied in order to assess its antitumor effects and identify the molecular mechanisms involved. SGC7901 gastric cancer cells were treated with evodiamine at various concentrations (0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 \u00b5mol/l) for 24 h. Inhibition of the proliferation of SGC7901 cells was assessed using an MTT assay. The morphology of treated SGC7901 cells was observed using optical microscopy; in addition, the effect of evodiamine on the nuclear morphology of cells was analyzed using Hoechst 33258 staining with fluorescence microscopy. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometric analysis were used for investigating the effect of evodiamine on the induction of apoptosis in SGC7901 cells. Expression levels of survivin and caspase-3 were examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that evodiamine significantly inhibited SGC7901 cell proliferation (P<0.05) and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Morphological characteristics of apoptosis were confirmed using optical microscopy and Hoechst 33258 staining analysis indicated that evodiamine treatment resulted in the typical characteristics of apoptotic programmed cell death, including cell shrinkage and apoptotic body formation. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that evodiamine induced the dose-dependent apoptosis of SGC7901 cells. Messenger (m)RNA levels of survivin decreased and those of caspase-3 increase in a dose-dependent manner in SGC7901 cells treated with various concentrations of evodiamine for 24 h. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that evodiamine inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells via the downregulation of survivin and upregulation of caspase-3 mRNA.",

With the increase in the laboratory use of zebrafish, several advantages, such as a high genetic homology to humans and transparent embryos, which allow clear disease evaluation, have greatly widened its use as a model for studying tumor development in vivo. The use of zebrafish has been applied in several areas of cancer research, mainly in the following domains: (1) establishing cancer models by carcinogenic chemical, genetic technology, and xenotransplantation; (2) evaluating tumor angiogenesis; (3) studying tumor metastasis; and (4) anti-tumor drug screening and drug toxicity evaluation. In this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the role of zebrafish in order to underline the advantages of using them as a model organism in cancer research. Several related successful events are also reviewed.",

In this study, we identify a novel CD39 \u03b3\u03b4Treg in human colorectal cancer (CRC). CD39 \u03b3\u03b4Tregs are the predominant regulatory T cells and have more potent immunosuppressive activity than CD4 or CD8 Tregs via the adenosine-mediated pathway but independent of TGF-\u03b2 or IL-10. They also secrete cytokines including IL-17A and GM-CSF, which may chemoattract myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs), thus establishing an immunosuppressive network. We further demonstrate that tumor-derived TGF-\u03b21 induces CD39 \u03b3\u03b4T cells from paired normal colon tissues to produce more adenosine and become potent immunosuppressive T cells. Moreover, CD39 \u03b3\u03b4Treg infiltration is positively correlated with TNM stage and other unfavorable clinicopathological features, implicating that CD39 \u03b3\u03b4Tregs are one of the key players in establishment of immunosuppressive TME in human CRC that may be critical for tumor immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Plenty of studies have assessed the association between intestinal metaplasia (IM) and gastric cancer risk, while the results were inconsistent. We aimed to assess the risk of gastric cancer among patients with IM. Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases. Baseline characteristics and outcomes from the included studies were extracted independently by two investigators. Either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model was used to composite the pooled OR for gastric cancer risk. Finally, a total of 21 studies, which comprised 402636 participants and 4535 gastric cancer patients, were finally included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with those participants without IM, IM patients were at a higher risk of gastric cancer (pooled OR=3.58, 95% CI 2.71-4.73). We observed that incomplete IM (pooled OR=9.48, 95% CI 4.33-20.78) but not complete IM (pooled OR=1.55, 95% CI 0.91-2.65) was significantly associated with a higher gastric cancer risk. Besides, it appeared that gastric cancer risk was higher among patients with IM in the corpus (pooled OR=7.39, 95% CI 4.94-11.06) than those with IM in the antrum only (pooled OR=4.06, 95% CI 2.79-5.91). And the pooled ORs for gastric non-cardia cancer and gastric cardia cancer were 4.98 (95% CI 3.12-7.95) and 1.93 (95% CI 1.15-3.24), respectively. In conclusion, patients with IM were at a higher risk of gastric cancer, especially for incomplete IM and IM in the corpus. The current evidence supports the use of IM subtypes in the surveillance of gastric cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Baseline clinical and laboratory covariates were correlated with the outcome (clinical remission) of EEN in active CD (CDAI \u2265150) by both univariable and multivariable analyses. A total of 67 from a consecutive of 136 active CD patients were enrolled. L4b (from treitz ligament to distal 1/3 ileum) involvement was negatively and high serum albumin (\u226535\u2009g/L) was positively associated with clinical remission (OR: 0.14, OR: 14.71). In conclusion, L4b sparing and high serum albumin might predict a favorable outcome of EEN in active CD (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT 02942511).",

        "abstract": "Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have been proposed as a key driving force of tumor growth and relapse in colorectal cancer (CRC), and therefore, they are promising targets for cancer therapy. Epidemiological evidence has suggested that the daily use of aspirin reduces overall mortality of CRC and the risk of distant metastasis. We investigated the effect and mechanism of aspirin on CSCs in CRC.  The ratio of CSCs was analyzed after aspirin treatment both in a cell model and patient samples. Chemically modified aspirin and immunoprecipitation were adopted to detect the target proteins of aspirin. A locus-specific light-inducible epigenetic modification system based on CRISPR technology was constructed to verify the causal relationship in these molecular events. In vivo characterization was performed in a xenograft model.  We found that aspirin induces apoptosis in enriched colorectal CSCs, inhibits tumor progression, and enhances the anti-neoplastic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, aspirin directly interacts with p300 in the nucleus, promotes H3K9 acetylation, activates  expression, and induces apoptosis in colorectal CSCs. Notably, these effects of aspirin are absent in non-CSCs since H3K9 is hypermethylated in non-CSCs and the effects are not induced by other NSAIDs. In addition, aspirin can suppress oxaliplatin-enriched CSCs and serve as an adjuvant therapy.  Taken together, we revealed a unique epigenetic and cox-independent pathway (p300-AcH3K9-FasL axis) by which aspirin eliminates colorectal CSCs. These findings establish an innovative framework of the therapeutic significance of aspirin.",

Cancer stem cells (CSC) have been demonstrated to be vital for tumor initiation and recurrence. microRNAs may act as an oncogenes or tumor suppressors in numerous cancers. The present study demonstrated that microRNA-141 (miR\u2011141) was downregulated in CSC compared with differentiated cancer cells, and in tumor compared with healthy tissue. miR\u2011141 may inhibit CRC cell proliferation and the maintenance of CSC stemness, thereby enhancing drug susceptibility. In addition, the present study identified cyclin D2 as a novel target gene of miR\u2011141. In conclusion, the antitumor role of miR\u2011141 and its target cyclin\u00a0D2 may suggest the development of miR\u2011141 as a potential therapeutic agent.",

        "abstract": "Ginsenosides exhibit various neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress. However, which ginsenoside provides optimal effects for the treatment of neurological disorders as a potent antioxidant remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study investigated and compared the neuroprotective effects of the Rb1, Rd, Rg1 and Re ginsenosides on neural progenitor cells (NPCs) following tert-Butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced oxidative injury. Primary rat embryonic cortical NPCs were prepared from E14.5 embryos of Sprague-Dawley rats. The oxidative injury model was established with t-BHP. A lactate dehydrogenase assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining were used to measure the viability of the NPCs pre-treated with ginsenosides under oxidative stress. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to determine the activation of intracellular signaling pathways triggered by the pretreatment of ginsenosides. Among the four ginsenosides, only Rb1 attenuated t-BHP toxicity in the NPCs, and the nuclear factor (erythroizd-derived 2)-like 2/heme oxygenase-1 pathway was found to be key in the intracellular defense against oxidative stress. The present study demonstrated the anti-oxidative effects of ginsenoside Rb1 on NPCs, and suggested that Rb1 may offer potential as a potent antioxidant for the treatment of neurological disorders.",

We aimed to systematically evaluate the association between CD and risk of all malignancies as well as gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy specifically.The PUBMED and EMBASE databases were searched to identify eligible studies from 1960 to March 2015, without restriction. Two reviewers independently performed the study inclusion and data extraction methods. Odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios, or standardized incidence ratios were pooled using either a fixed- or a random-effects model. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were used to explore sources of heterogeneity.A total of 17 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled OR for risk of all malignancies was 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09\u20131.44), whereas the pooled OR for risk of GI malignancy was 1.60 (95% CI 1.39\u20131.84) and suggested an inverse association with CD. Moreover, patients with CD were at a higher risk of esophageal cancer (pooled OR\u200a=\u200a3.72, 95% CI 1.90\u20137.28) and small intestinal carcinoma (pooled OR\u200a=\u200a14.41, 95% CI 5.53\u201337.60), whereas no significant associations were observed for other GI cancers, including gastric, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers. Subgroup analyses also indicated that the results were influenced by the CD diagnostic method, as well as the follow-up time after CD diagnosis.CD was associated with increased risk of all malignancies as well as GI malignancies, including esophageal cancer and small intestinal carcinoma.",

Whether the design of isolation door is reasonable or not can be evaluated by four indicators, i.e., operational cost, time, efficiency, and safety. Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS)-hypercube segmentation method and hesitant fuzzy set algorithm are applied to make the evaluation more objective. Therefore, the leading innovation points are two kinds of decision-making models proposed and applied in the process of studying how to use isolation door reasonably, where the first one has no fixed indicator weight, whereas the second one has. Furthermore, the decision-making model using the isolated doors is verified by data collected from dangerous goods warehouse in Shanghai Port and 34 samples from the clients\u2019 storage capacity. The main characteristic of this paper is that with the rational use of isolated doors, the operational efficiency of stock in and stock out processes can improve as well as the logistics cost can be reduced. Finally, a comparison has been made between the proposed interconnected dangerous goods warehouse with isolated doors and the existing one, which indicates that the former one is more effective.",

As(III) and MAs(III) can be interconverted in the unicellular cyanobacterium  sp.

It is not clear how the cells prevent a futile cycle of methylation and demethylation. To investigate the relationship between arsenic methylation and demethylation, we constructed strains of  AW3110 (\u0394) expressing  or/and . Expression of  conferred MAs(III) resistance through MAs(III) demethylation.

The major species found in solution was dimethylarsenate [DMAs(V)]. Co-expression of  and  conferred As(III) resistance at levels similar to that with  alone, although the main species found in solution after As(III) biotransformation was methylarsenate [MAs(V)] rather than DMAs(V).

Thus, our results suggest that at low concentrations of arsenic, NsArsM activity predominates, while NsArsI activity predominates at high concentrations. We propose that coexistence of  and  genes in  could be advantageous for several reasons. First, it confers a broader spectrum of resistance to both As(III) and MAs(III). Second, at low concentrations of arsenic, the MAs(III) produced by NsArsM will possibly have antibiotic-like properties and give the organism a competitive advantage.

PCC 7120 (Nostoc), a typical filamentous cyanobacterium ubiquitous in aquatic system, is recognized as a model organism to study prokaryotic cell differentiation and nitrogen fixation. In this study, Nostoc cells incubated with arsenite (As(III)) for two weeks were extracted with dichloromethane/methanol (DCM/MeOH) and the extract was partitioned between water and DCM. Arsenic species in aqueous and DCM layers were determined using high performance liquid chromatography - inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICPMS/ESIMSMS). In addition to inorganic arsenic (iAs), the aqueous layer also contained monomethylarsonate (MAs(V)), dimethylarsinate (DMAs(V)), and the two arsenosugars, namely a glycerol arsenosugar (Oxo-Gly) and a phosphate arsenosugar (Oxo-PO4). Two major arsenosugar phospholipids (AsSugPL982 and AsSugPL984) were detected in DCM fraction. Arsenic in the growth medium was also investigated by HPLC/ICPMS and shown to be present mainly as the inorganic forms As(III) and As(V) accounting for 29%-38% and 29%-57% of the total arsenic respectively. The total arsenic of methylated arsenic, arsenosugars, and arsenosugar phospholipids in Nostoc cells with increasing As(III) exposure were not markedly different, indicating that the transformation to organoarsenic in Nostoc was not dependent on As(III) concentration in the medium. Our results provide new insights into the role of cyanobacteria in the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic.",

        "abstract": "Arsenosugars are arsenic-containing ribosides that play a substantial role in arsenic biogeochemical cycles. Arsenosugars were identified more than thirty years ago, and yet their mechanism of biosynthesis remains unknown. In this study we report identification of the arsS gene from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and show that it is involved in arsenosugar biosynthesis. In the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ars operon, arsS is adjacent to the arsM gene that encodes an As(III) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methyltransferase. The gene product, ArsS, contains a characteristic CX3CX2C motif which is typical for the radical SAM superfamily. The function of ArsS was identified from a combination of arsS disruption in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and heterologous expression of arsM and arsS in Escherichia coli. Both genes are necessary, indicating a multi-step pathway of arsenosugar biosynthesis. In addition, we demonstrate that ArsS orthologs from three other freshwater cyanobacteria and one picocyanobacterium are involved in arsenosugar biosynthesis in those microbes. This study represents the identification of the first two steps in the pathway of arsenosugar biosynthesis. Our discovery expands the catalytic repertoire of the diverse radical SAM enzyme superfamily and provides a basis for studying the biogeochemistry of complex organoarsenicals.",

        "abstract": "Arsenite [As(III)] and methylarsenite [MAs(III)] are the most toxic inorganic and methylated arsenicals, respectively. As(III) and MAs(III) can be interconverted in the unicellular cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (Nostoc), which has both the arsM gene (NsarsM), which is responsible for arsenic methylation, and the arsI gene (NsarsI), which is responsible for MAs(III) demethylation. It is not clear how the cells prevent a futile cycle of methylation and demethylation. To investigate the relationship between arsenic methylation and demethylation, we constructed strains of Escherichia coli AW3110 (\u0394arsRBC) expressing NsarsM or/and NsarsI. Expression of NsarsI conferred MAs(III) resistance through MAs(III) demethylation. Compared to NsArsI, NsArsM conferred higher resistance to As(III) and lower resistance to MAs(III) by methylating both As(III) and MAs(III). The major species found in solution was dimethylarsenate [DMAs(V)]. Co-expression of NsarsM and NsarsI conferred As(III) resistance at levels similar to that with NsarsM alone, although the main species found in solution after As(III) biotransformation was methylarsenate [MAs(V)] rather than DMAs(V). Co-expression of NsarsM and NsarsI conferred a higher level of resistance to MAs(III) than found with expression of NsarsM alone but lower than expression of only NsarsI. Cells co-expressing both genes converted MAs(III) to a mixture of As(III) and DMAs(V). In Nostoc NsarsM is constitutively expressed, while NsarsI is inducible by either As(III) or MAs(III). Thus, at low concentrations of arsenic, NsArsM activity predominates, while NsArsI activity predominates at high concentrations. We propose that coexistence of arsM and arsI genes in Nostoc is advantageous for several reasons. First, it confers a broader spectrum of resistance to both As(III) and MAs(III). Second, at low concentrations of arsenic, the MAs(III) produced by NsArsM will have antibiotic-like properties and give the organism a competitive advantage. Finally, these results shed light on the role of cyanobacteria in the arsenic biogeochemical cycle.",

        "abstract": "Arsenate (As(V)) is an analog of phosphate (Pi), and previous studies have shown that As(V) and Pi are absorbed via the same transport systems in some organisms. However, little is known about which periplasmic phosphate-binding proteins (PBPs) of ABC-type Pi transporters play major roles in As(V) uptake by cyanobacteria. In this study, the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis) was chosen to study the ability of PBPs to discriminate between Pi and As(V). We found that As(V) and Pi competed for uptake via Pi transporters when Synechocystis was treated with As(V) and/or Pi in short-term incubation. The As/P molar ratios of Synechocystis wild type (WT) and mutants (\u2206sphX, \u2206pstS2, \u2206sll0540, and \u2206sphXpstS1) were measured, and they were significantly different with the order WT u003e \u2206pstS2 u003e \u2206sll0540 u003e \u2206sphXpstS1 u003e \u2206sphX. Furthermore, As(V) uptake by Escherichia coli strain Transetta expressing PBP genes, particularly sphX or sll0540, was significantly increased when PBP gene (pstS1, pstS2, sphX, or sll0540) was separately expressed in Transetta at the same level. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses of PBPs showed that SphX and Sll0540 belonged to the low-affinity PBPs, while PstS1 and PstS2 were clustered with the high-affinity PBPs. These results implied that As(V) was taken up via Pi transporters, and the low-affinity PBPs, SphX and Sll0540, made a significant contribution to As(V) uptake.",

Microbe-mediated cycling of As is largely mediated by detoxification and energy metabolism in microorganisms. We here report the development of a novel high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR) chip (AsChip) for comprehensive profiling of genes involved in As microbial As cycling (As genes). AsChip contained 81 primer sets targeting 19 As genes and the 16S rRNA gene as a reference gene. As gene amplicon sequencing showed high identity (> 96%) of newly designed primers corresponding to their targets. AsChip displayed high sensitivity (plasmid template serial dilution test; r = -0.99), with more than 96% of all PCR assays yielding true positive signals. R2 coefficients for standard curves and PCR amplification efficiencies averaged 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. A high correlation between CT values obtained by AsChip and conventional qPCR was obtained ( r = 0.962, P < 0.001). Finally, we successfully applied AsChip on soil samples from a chromium-copper-arsenic contaminated field site and identified diverse As genes with total abundance average of 0.4 As gene copies per 16S rRNA. Our results indicate that AsChip constitutes a robust tool for comprehensive quantitative profiling of As genes in environmental samples.",

However, the impacts of chemical mixtures on environmental quality and ecosystem health have been overlooked in the past. Among the complex interactions between different contaminants, their relationship with the rise of antibiotic resistance (AR) is an emerging environmental concern. In this paper, we review recent progresses on how chemicals or chemical mixtures promote AR. We propose that, through co-selection, agents causing stress to bacteria may induce AR. The mechanisms for chemical mixtures to promote AR are also discussed. We also propose that, mechanistic understanding of co-selection of chemical mixtures for AR should be a future research priority in environmental health research.",

        "abstract": "Plasmid conjugation is one of the dominant mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer, playing a noticeable role in the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Broad host range plasmids are known to transfer to diverse bacteria in extracted soil bacterial communities when evaluated by filter mating incubation. However, the persistence and dissemination of broad range plasmid in natural soil has not been well studied. In this study,  with a conjugative antibiotic resistance plasmid RP4 was inoculated into a soil microcosm, the fate and persistence of  and RP4 were monitored by quantitative PCR. The concentrations of  and RP4 both rapidly decreased within 15-day incubation.  then decayed at a significantly lower rate during subsequent incubation, however, no further decay of RP4 was observed, resulting in an elevated RP4/ ratio (up to 10) after 75-day incubation, which implied potential transfer of RP4 to soil microbiota. We further sorted RP4 recipient bacteria from the soil microcosms by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Spread of RP4 increased during 75-day microcosm operation and was estimated at around 10 transconjugants per recipient at the end of incubation. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of transconjugants showed that host bacteria of RP4 were affiliated to more than 15 phyla, with increased diversity and shift in the composition of host bacteria.  was the most dominant phylum in the transconjugant pools. Transient transfer of RP4 to some host bacteria was observed. These results emphasize the prolonged persistence of  and RP4 in natural soil microcosms, and highlight the potential risks of increased spread potential of plasmid and broader range of host bacteria in disseminating ARGs in soil.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, herbal medicine is consumed by drinking decoctions produced by boiling herbs with water. The functional components of the decoction are heat stable. Small RNAs (sRNAs) were reported as a new class of functional components in decoctions. However, the mechanisms by which sRNAs survive heat treatment of the decoction and enter cells are unclear. Previous studies showed that plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs), which we call botanosomes, could deliver therapeutic reagents in vivo. Here, we report that heat-stable decoctosomes (ELNs) from decoctions have more therapeutic effects than the decoctions in vitro and demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Furthermore, sRNAs, such as HJT-sRNA-m7 and PGY-sRNA-6, in the decoctosome exhibit potent anti-fibrosis and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively. Decoctosome is comprised of lipids, chemical compounds, proteins, and sRNAs. A medical decoctosome mimic is called bencaosome. A single lipid sphinganine (d22:0) identified in the decoctosome was mixed and heated with the synthesized sRNAs to form the simplest bencaosome. This simple bencaosome structure was identified by critical micelle concentration (cmc) assay that sRNAs coassembled with sphinganine (d22:0) to form the lipid layers of vesicles. The heating process facilitates co-assembly of sRNAs and sphinganine (d22:0) until a steady state is reached. The artificially produced sphinganine-HJT-sRNA-m7 and sphinganine- PGY-sRNA-6 bencaosomes could ameliorate bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and poly(I:C)-induced lung inflammation, respectively, following oral administration in mice. Our study not only demonstrates that the herbal decoctosome may represent a combinatory remedy in precision medicine but also provides an effective oral delivery route for nucleic acid therapy.",

        "abstract": "Arsenic-contaminated water is a serious hazard for human health. Plankton plays a critical role in the fate and toxicity of arsenic in water by accumulation and biotransformation. Spirulina platensis (S. platensis), a typical plankton, is often used as a supplement or feed for pharmacy and aquiculture, and may introduce arsenic into the food chain, resulting in a risk to human health. However, there are few studies about how S. platensis biotransforms arsenic. In this study, we investigated arsenic biotransformation by S. platensis. When exposed to arsenite (As(III)), S. platensis accumulated arsenic up to 4.1mg/kg dry weight. After exposure to As(III), arsenate (As(V)) was the predominant species making up 64% to 86% of the total arsenic. Monomethylarsenate (MMA(V)) and dimethylarsenate (DMA(V)) were also detected. An arsenite S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase from S. platensis (SpArsM) was identified and characterized. SpArsM showed low identity with other reported ArsM enzymes. The Escherichia coli AW3110 bearing SparsM gene resulted in As(III) methylation and conferring resistance to As(III). The in vitro assay showed that SpArsM exhibited As(III) methylation activity. DMA(V) and a small amount of MMA(V) were detected in the reaction system within 0.5hr. A truncated SpArsM derivative lacking the last 34 residues still had the ability to methylate As(III). The three single mutants of SpArsM (C59S, C186S, and C238S) abolished the capability of As(III) methylation, suggesting the three cysteine residues are involved in catalysis. We propose that SpArsM is responsible for As methylation and detoxification of As(III) and may contribute to As biogeochemistry.",

The magnetic properties of Cu/Fe/SiO2/Si grown by dc magnetron sputtering were investigated. The in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy was probed by the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). The value of UMA, Ku = 2.5 \ufffd\ufffd103 J/m 3, was simulated from the field dependence of ac susceptibility along the hard axis according to the Stoner - Wohlfarth (S - W) model, which is consistent with Ku = 2.7 \ufffd\ufffd 103 J/m3 calculated from the magnetic hysteresis loops. Our results show that the magneto-optical Kerr effect susceptometry can be employed to determine the magnetic anisotropy constant owing to its high sensitivity. ? 2014 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Here, we present the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect of Fe single crystal film on vicinal Si(111) substrate with atomically flat ultrathin p(2 \u00d7 2) iron silicide as buffer layer. Owing to the tiny misorientation from Fe(111) plane, the symmetry of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy changes from the six-fold to a superposition of six-fold, four-fold and a weakly uniaxial contribution. Furthermore, the magnitudes of various magnetic anisotropy constants were derived from torque curves on the basis of AMR results.

It was observed that the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) of Fe films grown on the Si(111) substrate enhanced with decreasing the terrace width and superimposed on the weak six-fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Furthermore, on the basis of the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images, self-correlation function calculations confirmed that the UMA was attributed mainly from the long-range dipolar interaction between the spins on the surface.

The values of in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) constant Ku and four-fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant K1 were derived from magnetic torque curves on the base of AMR results. It was found that the value of Ku increases with increasing deposition angle with respect to the surface normal, while the value of K1 remains almost constant for all the samples. Furthermore, by using MOKE results, the Ku values of the films deposited obliquely were also derived from the magnetization curves along hard axis. The results of AMR method were then compared with that of hard axis fitting method (coherent rotation) and found that both methods have almost identical values of UMA constant for each sample.",

Here, angular dependence anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) measurements at different magnetic fields were employed to determine magnetic anisotropy constants and domain wall pinning energy of Fe/MgO(001) ultrathin film. The AMR curves at magnetic fields which are high enough to ensure the coherent rotation of magnetization indicate a smooth behavior without hysteresis between clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) rotations. By analyzing magnetic torque, the magnetic anisotropy constants can be obtained. On the other hand, the AMR curves at low fields show abrupt transitions with hysteresis between CW and CCW rotations, suggesting the presence of multi-domain structures. The domain wall pinning energy can be obtained by analyzing different behaviors of AMR. Our work suggests that AMR measurements can be employed to figure out precisely the contributions of magnetic anisotropy and domain wall pinning energy, which is still a critical issue for spintronics.",

Due to the effect of the vicinal substrate, the magnetic anisotropy is the superposition of a four-fold, a two-fold and a weakly six-fold contribution. It is found that the temperature dependence of the first-order magnetocrystalline anisotropies coefficient follows power laws of the reduced magnetization  m (T)(= M (T)/ M (0)) being consistent with the Callen and Callenu0027s theory. However the temperature dependence of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) shows novel behavior that decreases roughly as a function of temperature with different power law for samples with different thickness. We also found that the six-fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy is almost invariable over a wide temperature range. Possible mechanisms leading to the different exponents are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The magnetization reversal process of Fe/MgO(001) thin film is investigated by combining transverse and longitudinal hysteresis loops. Owing to the competition between domain wall pinning energy and weak uniaxial magnetic anisotropy,the typical magnetization reversal process of Fe ultrathin film can take place via either an l-jump process near the easy axis, or a 2-jump process near the hard axis, depending on the applied field orientation. Besides, the hysteresis loop presents strong asymmetry resulting from the variation of the detected light intensity due to the quadratic magneto-optic effect. Furthermore, we modify the detectable light intensity formula and simulate the hysteresis loops of the Kerr signal. The results show that they are in good agreement with the experimental data.",

Under various electric fields, normalized magnetic hysteresis loops of Ni films change in width; this represents the change of coercive field (\u0394H c). Loop shapes are found to depend on the angle between the magnetic field and the sample, where changes in the shape reveal a small rotation of UMA. All these changes show that the magnetic properties vary periodically with a periodic electric field, by strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling in the Ni/Ag/PMN-PT/Ag heterostructure. The poled PMN-PT produces strains under electric fields in the range of \u22124.2 kV cm\u22121 \u2264 E \u2264 4.2 kV cm\u22121, then transfers it to Ni films resulting in changes to its H c and UMA. The curves of the in-plane H c and strain, at two mutually orthogonal directions, represent butterfly patterns versus the applied electric field. In addition, the changes observed in both the H c and strain show asymmetric features in two orthogonal directions, which results in a small rotation angle of the UMA of Ni as the electric field decreases. The effective manipulation of magnitude and orientation of magnetic anisotropy via electric fields in ferromagnetic/ferroelectric (FM/FE) heterostructures is an important step towards controlling the magnetic tunnel junctions.",

Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and polaron transport model revealed that 5, 7-ICZ can reach higher mobilities than the others thanks to relatively higher hole transfer integral that links to stronger intermolecular interaction due to the presence of multiple NH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7pi and CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7pi(py) interactions with energy close to common NH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds, as well as overall lower hole-vibrational coupling owing to the absence of coupling of holes to low frequency modes due to better pi conjugation.",

        "abstract": "Weak intermolecular interaction in organic semiconducting molecular crystals plays an important role in determining molecular packing and electronic properties. Here, single crystals of metal-free and metal phthalocyanines were synthesized to investigate central metal atom coordination in affecting their molecular packing and resultant electronic properties. Single-crystal field-effect transistors were made to show the hole mobility order of ZnPc>MnPc>FePc>CoPc>CuPc>H2Pc>NiPc. The conjunction of density functional theory and 1D polaron transport theory reach a good agreement in reproducing the experimentally measured trend for hole mobility. Additional detail analysis at density functional theory level suggests the metal atom coordination into H2Pc planes can tune the hole mobility via adjusting the intermolecular distances along the shortest axis with closest parallel Pi stackings. This is achieved by intricate intermolecular metal-pyrrole nitrogen atom interactions originated from different d-orbital occupation states of these metal atoms, together with synergetic Pi\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Pi interactions between other atoms close to central metal atoms between neighboring metal phthalocyanine molecules with dependency on the strength of intermolecular metal-pyrrole nitrogen atom interactions.",

        "abstract": "A new asymmetric furan and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (TTFDPP) building block for conjugated polymers is designed and used to generate a donor-acceptor semiconducting polymer, poly[3-(furan-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-6-(thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-alt-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (abbreviated to PTTFDPP-TT), consisting of TTFDPP unit copolymerized with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene comonomer (TT), which is further synthesized. Results demonstrate that PTTFDPP-TT-based thin-film transistors in a bottom-gate bottom-contact device configuration exhibit typical hole-transporting property, with weak temperature dependence for charge carrier mobility from room temperature to 200 \u00b0C. In addition, the good solubility of PTTFDPP-TT due to the incorporation of a polar furan unit and an asymmetric conjugated structure makes it able to be solution processed with a less toxic nonchlorinated solvent such as toluene, demonstrating comparable performance with that prepared from chlorinated solution. These results suggest PTTFDPP-TT as a promising organic semiconductor candidate for annealing-free, environmentally benign, and less energy-consuming applications in large-area flexible organic electronic devices.",

It has been demonstrated that these compounds can be applied to both organic semiconducting active materials and organic conductors by appropriate molecular design. 7,7,8,8-Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and FxTCNQ (x = 1, 2, 4) as acceptors and aromatic hydrocarbons form a variety of compounds in which the degree of charge transfer (DCT) is adjustable. The donor, acceptor, and stoichiometry of organic charge-transfer compounds are the main factors for tuning the DCT.

        "abstract": "The molecular design of organic battery electrode is a big challenge. Here, we apply controlled experiments to synthesize two metal-free organosulfur acenes and shed insights into the battery properties using first-principle calculations. A newly home-made zone-melting chemical vapor transport (ZM-CVT) apparatus was first fabricated to provide a simple, solvent-free and continuous synthetic protocol and produce single crystals of tetrathiotetracene (TTT) and hexathiapentacene (HTP) at large scale. Single crystals of HTP showed better Li-ion battery performance and higher cycling stability than those of TTT. A two-step, three electron lithiation mechanism instead of commonly depicted two electron mechanism is proposed for the HTP Li-ion battery based on density functional theory calculations. The superior performance of HTP is linked to unique trisulfide (S-S-S) bonding scenarios in its molecular as well as crystalline forms, which is also responsible for an intricate interplay of intermolecular interactions that leads to its crystal structural merit with channel-like free-volumes along stacking direction. In-depth theoretical analysis suggests organosulfur acene is a potential prototypical candidate for good organic battery material with tunable properties, which also indicates tuning of the nature of chemical bonds formed by sulfur atoms is a critical guideline in designing for similar organic battery material with desirable properties.",

        "abstract": "Organic semiconductors have been a large family of materials that have attracted wide attention in the last few decades due to their special features of large-scale synthesis, low-cost fabrication, flexible devices, etc. The introduction of functional groups on the main building block makes the chemical synthesis result in various isomers, which are difficult to be separated from each other. Specifically, it is still contradictive to conclude which kind of isomer can bring about a better performance: anti-, syn-, or the anti-/syn-mixture of isomers? In this review, isomerically pure molecules obtained by direct controlled synthesis are introduced, and the solvent-dependent crystallization to distinguish some anti-/syn-isomers is also discussed. The charge transport properties of the molecules of anti-, syn-, and anti-/syn-mixture are summarized to find general clues for designing high-performance organic semiconductors via control of anti-/syn-isomerization. A review of theoretical data suggests that syn-isomers are likely to have relatively weaker hole-vibrational coupling as compared to anti-isomers. However, the hole transfer integrals are shown to have less dependency on anti-/syn-isomerization for charge transport channels along parallel packed molecules. In contrast, higher minimum hole transfer integrals for transverse dimers are revealed for syn-isomers.",

        "abstract": "The fluorination of p-type metal phthalocyanines produces n-type semiconductors, allowing the design of organic electronic circuits that contain inexpensive heterojunctions made from chemically and thermally stable p- and n-type organic semiconductors. For the evaluation of close to intrinsic transport properties, high-quality centimeter-sized single crystals of F16CuPc, F16CoPc and F16ZnPc have been grown. New crystal structures of F16CuPc, F16CoPc and F16ZnPc have been determined. Organic single-crystal field-effect transistors have been fabricated to study the effects of the central metal atom on their charge transport properties. The F16ZnPc has the highest electron mobility (~1.1 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)). Theoretical calculations indicate that the crystal structure and electronic structure of the central metal atom determine the transport properties of fluorinated metal phthalocyanines.",

        "abstract": "Two distinct approaches, the Frenkel-Dirac time-dependent variation and the Haken-Strobl model, are adopted to study energy transfer dynamics in single-ring and double-ring light-harvesting (LH) systems in purple bacteria. It is found that the inclusion of long-range dipolar interactions in the two methods results in significant increase in intra- or inter-ring exciton transfer efficiency. The dependence of exciton transfer efficiency on trapping positions on single rings of LH2 (B850) and LH1 is similar to that in toy models with nearest-neighbor coupling only. However, owing to the symmetry breaking caused by the dimerization of BChls and dipolar couplings, such dependence has been largely suppressed. In the studies of coupled-ring systems, both methods reveal an interesting role of dipolar interactions in increasing energy transfer efficiency by introducing multiple intra/inter-ring transfer paths. Importantly, the time scale (4\u2009\u2009ps) of inter-ring exciton transfer obtained from polaron dynamics is in good agreement with previous studies. In a double-ring LH2 system, non-nearest neighbor interactions can induce symmetry breaking, which leads to global and local minima of the average trapping time in the presence of a non-zero dephasing rate, suggesting that environment dephasing helps preserve quantum coherent energy transfer when the perfect circular symmetry in the hypothetic system is broken. This study reveals that dipolar coupling between chromophores may play an important role in the high energy transfer efficiency in the LH systems of purple bacteria and many other natural photosynthetic systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cold-formed steel (CFS) elements are increasingly used as load-bearing members in construction, including in seismic regions. More conventional hot-rolled steel and concrete building structures are typically allowed by the design standards to exceed their elastic limits in severe earthquakes, rendering parameters indicating ductility and energy dissipation of primordial importance. However, insufficient research has yet been conducted on the energy dissipation of CFS structures. In the majority of previous optimization research on CFS sections the ultimate capacity, as typically controlled by local, distortional and/or global buckling modes, is considered to be the sole optimization criterion. This paper aims to improve the seismic performance of CFS elements by optimising their geometric and material highly non-linear post-buckling behaviour to achieve maximum energy dissipation. A novel shape optimisation framework is presented using the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm, linked to GMNIA ABAQUS finite element analyses. The relative dimensions of the cross-section, the location and number of intermediate stiffeners and the inclination of the lip stiffeners are considered to be the main design variables. All plate slenderness limit values and limits on the relative dimensions of the cross-sectional components as defined by Eurocode 3, as well as a number of practical manufacturing and construction limitations, are taken into account as constraints in the optimisation problem. It is demonstrated that a substantial improvement in energy dissipation capacity and ductility can be achieved through the proposed optimization framework. Optimized cross-sectional shapes are presented which dissipate up to 60% more energy through plastic deformations than a comparable commercially available lipped channel.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper aims to study the interaction of local and overall flexural buckling in cold-formed steel (CFS) channels under axial compression. Detailed nonlinear FE models were developed and validated against a total of 36 axial compression tests on CFS plain and lipped channel columns with pin-ended boundary conditions. The numerical models incorporated the non-linear stress-strain behaviour of CFS material and enhanced properties of cold-worked corner regions obtained from coupon tests. The effects of initial geometric imperfections of the specimens measured by a specially designed set-up with laser displacement transducers were also taken into account. The developed FE models produced excellent predictions of the ultimate strength of the specimens obtained from experimental tests. The validated FE models and experimental results were then used to assess the adequacy of the effective width method in Eurocode 3 (EC3) and Direct Strength Method (DSM) in estimating the design capacity of a wide range of conventional and optimised design CFS channel column sections. The results indicate that Eurocode 3 provides conservative predictions (on average 21% deviation) for the compressive capacity of plain and lipped channel sections, while in general DSM predictions are more accurate for lipped channels. A comparison between FE predictions and tested results show that geometric imperfections can change the FE predictions by up to 20% and 40%, respectively, for lipped and plain channel columns, while the strain hardening effect at the rounded corner regions of the cross-sections is negligible. The results also confirmed that the proposed numerical model is able to provide a consistent and reliable prediction on the efficiency of a previously proposed optimisation methodology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cold-formed steel (CFS) construction can lead to more efficient designs compared to hot-rolled steel members as a consequence of its high strength, light weight, ease of fabrication, and flexibility in their cross-section profiles. However, CFS members are vulnerable to local, distortional and overall buckling modes. This paper develops a numerical model to investigate the flexural strength and failure modes of CFS back-to-back channel beams and verifies the efficiency of an optimisation framework previously proposed. The model incorporates non-linear stress-strain behaviour and enhanced corner properties obtained from coupon tests, as well as initial geometric imperfections measured in physical specimens. To simulate the behaviour of a bolt bearing against a steel plate in the back-to-back section, a connector model is used that takes into account both slippage and bearing deformations. The developed Finite Element (FE) models are verified against six four-point bending tests on CFS back-to-back channel beams, where excellent agreement is found between the experimental results and the FE predictions. The validated FE models are then used to assess the adequacy of the effective width method in EC3 and the Direct Strength Method (DSM) in estimating the design capacity of conventional and optimum design CFS channel beam sections. The results indicate that both EC3 and DSM provide accurate predictions for the bending capacity of lipped channel beam sections. A comparison between FE predictions and tested results show that, the geometric imperfections can change the FE predictions of ultimate capacity by 7%, while the strain-hardening of CFS material at the round corners has negligible effects. It is also shown that EC3 uses a reduced cross-sectional property to calculate deflections, which can reasonably predict deflections with a slight overestimation (6%) at the serviceability load level.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cold-formed steel (CFS) sections can be designed in many configurations and, compared to hot-rolled steel elements, can lead to more efficient and economic design solutions. While CFS moment resisting frames can be used as an alternative to conventional CFS shear-wall systems to create more flexible space plans, their performance under strong earthquakes is questionable due to the inherited low local/distortional buckling of thin-walled CFS elements and limited ductility and energy dissipation capacity of typical CFS bolted-moment connections. To address the latter issue, this paper presents a comprehensive parametric study on the structural behaviour of CFS bolted beam-to-column connections with gusset plates under cyclic loading aiming to develop efficient design solutions for earthquake resistant frames. To simulate the hysteretic moment\u2013rotation behaviour and failure modes of selected CFS connections, an experimentally validated finite element model using ABAQUS is developed, which accounts for both nonlinear material properties and geometrical imperfections. Connection behaviour is modelled using a connector element, simulating the mechanical characteristics of a bolt bearing against a steel plate. The model is used to investigate the effects of bolt arrangement, cross-sectional shape, gusset plate thickness and cross-sectional slenderness on the seismic performance of CFS connections under cyclic loading. The results indicate that, for the same amount of material, folded flange beam sections with diamond or circle bolt arrangements can provide up to 100% and 250% higher ductility and energy dissipation capacity, respectively, compared to conventional flat-flange sections with square bolt arrangement. Using gusset plates with the same or lower thickness as the CFS beam may result in a premature failure mode in the gusset plate, which can considerably reduce the moment capacity of the connection. The proposed numerical model and design configurations can underpin the further development and implementation of CFS bolted-moment connections in seismic regions.",

To address this issue, a comprehensive analytical study is presented on the seismic performance of CFS bolted beam-to-column connections with fiction-slip mechanism aiming to obtain more efficient design solutions suitable for CFS frames in seismic regions. Experimentally validated finite element (FE) models in ABAQUS are used to predict the hysteretic behaviour and failure of a range of CFS connections by taking into account the characteristics of the bolting system as well as nonlinear material properties and geometrical imperfections. The developed models are then used to investigate the effects of CFS beam cross-sectional shape and classification, bolt configuration, and slip resistance on the seismic performance of the connections. It is shown that using bolting friction-slip mechanism can significantly increase (up to 200%) the ductility, energy dissipation capacity and damping coefficient of the connections especially for CFS beams with thinner plates (class 3 and 4). Based on the results, the best design configurations are identified to improve the cyclic response of the CFS connections under strong earthquakes. While conventional bolted moment connections with class 3 and 4 beam cross-sections generally do not satisfy the AISC requirements for intermediate and special moment frames, it is shown that optimum designed connections with bolting friction-slip mechanism can be efficiently used in high seismic regions.",

However, a crucial factor in such an optimisation is to arrive at a solution which is practical and fits within the constraints of the fabrication and construction industries. Targeting this objective, a comprehensive investigation was conducted on the practical optimisation of CFS beams using a Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) method. Six different CFS channel section prototypes were selected and then optimised with respect to their flexural strength, determined according to the effective width based provisions of Eurocode 3 (EC3) part 1\u20133. Comparing the capacities of the optimised sections to those of the original channel sections with the same amount of structural material, significant improvements were obtained. The accuracy of the optimisation procedure was assessed using experimentally validated nonlinear Finite Element (FE) analyses accounting for the effect of imperfections. The results indicated that, using the same amount of material, the optimum sections offered up to 25% and 75% more flexural strength for laterally braced and unbraced CFS beams, respectively, while they also satisfied predefined manufacturing and design constraints. Therefore, the proposed optimisation methodology has the potential to prove useful in practical design applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Computer aided design software enables the rapid conceptual creation of a curved surface geometry, whereas it is neither a convenient nor an obvious task for engineers to create a discrete grid structure on a complex surface that meets architectural and aesthetic requirements. This emphasizes the importance of grid generating tools and methods in the initial design stage. This paper presents an efficient design tool for the synthesis of free-form grid structures based on the \u201cguide line\u201d method, employing a fast and straightforward approach which achieves grids with rods of balanced length and fluent lines. The process starts with defining a limited number of curves (named the \u201cguide lines\u201d) on the surface, which are then used to determine the directions of the \u2018rods\u2019 of the grid. Two variations of this concept are introduced in this paper: the \u2018Guide Line Scaling Method\u2019 (GSM) and the \u2018Two Guide Lines with Two End Vertices Method\u2019 (2G2VM). Case studies are provided which illustrate the successful execution of these procedures. The results show that the free-form grid structures generated with the proposed methods feature a regular shape and fluent lines, thereby satisfying aesthetic requirements. These two methods have been programmed into the software ZD-Mesher, enabling rapid grid generation for structural design purposes.",

The results were further used to verify the accuracy of the current design procedures in Eurocode 3, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of a previously proposed optimisation methodology. A total of 36 axial compression tests on CFS channels with three different lengths (1\u202fm, 1.5\u202fm and 2\u202fm) and four different cross-sections were conducted under a concentrically applied load and pin-ended boundary conditions. The initial geometric imperfections of the specimens were measured using a specially designed set-up with laser displacement transducers. Material tests were also carried out to determine the tensile properties of the flat parts of the cross-sections, as well as the cold-worked corner regions. A comparison between the experimental results and the Eurocode 3 predictions showed that the effective width approach combined with the P\u2013M interaction equation proposed in Eurocode 3 to take into account the shift of the effective centroid consistently provided safe results. However, the Eurocode 3 procedures were also quite conservative in predicting the capacity pertaining to local-global interaction buckling, especially for plain channels. Furthermore, the experimental data confirmed the results of an optimisation study and demonstrated that the optimised CFS columns exhibited a capacity which was up to 26% higher than the standard channel with the same amount of material taken as a starting point.",

Automatic grid generation on a curved surface is important to more efficient design of free-form structures. However, it is neither a convenient nor an obvious task for engineers to create a discrete grid structure on a complex surface that meets the architectural requirements. Besides, research on the rapid grid generation methodology for free form structural design is still limited. In order to achieve better grid distribution of rods on free-form surface, a grid generation methodology which combines surface flattening technique with guide line method is put forward. The parametric domain of the free-form surface was firstly divided into a number of parts and a discrete free-form surface was accordingly formed by mapping the generated dividing points onto the curved surface. The free-form surface was then flattened based on the principle of identical area. Accordingly, the flattened rectangular lattices were fitted into the 2D surface where grids were formed by using the guide line method. Finally, the 2D grids were mapped onto the 3D surface, and grids were therefore generated on the given surface. A grid shape and rod length quality index was proposed to evaluate the shape of grid cells and rod lengths. The results show that the grid shape quality index and the deviation of rod length of the grid structure are reduced by up to 47% and 34% respectively by using the guide line method with surface flattening when compared to the method without surface flattening.",

The results indicated that drip irrigation with SW (4.61 or 8.04\u2005dS\u2005m\u22121) increased average soil water content and average soil salinity in the 0\u2013100\u2005cm depth.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Use of saline water in irrigated agriculture has become an important means for alleviating water scarcity in arid and semi-arid regions. The objective of this field experiment was to evaluate the effects of irrigation water salinity and N fertilization on soil physicochemical and biological properties related to nitrification and denitrification. A 3\u00d72 factorial design was used with three levels of irrigation water salinity (0.35, 4.61 and 8.04 dS m \u22121 ) and two N rates (0 and 360 kg N ha \u22121 ). The results indicated that irrigation water salinity and N fertilization had significant effects on many soil physicochemical properties including water content, salinity, pH, NH 4 -N concentration, and NO 3 -N concentration. The abundance (i.e., gene copy number) of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) was greater than that of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in all treatments. Irrigation water salinity had no significant effect on the abundance of AOA or AOB in unfertilized plots. However, saline irrigation water (i.e., the 4.61 and 8.04 dS m \u22121  treatments) reduced AOA abundance, AOB abundance and potential nitrification rate in N fertilized plots. Regardless of N application rate, saline irrigation water increased urease activity but reduced the activities of both nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase. Irrigation with saline irrigation water significantly reduced cotton biomass, N uptake and yield. Nitrogen application exacerbated the negative effect of saline water. These results suggest that brackish water and saline water irrigation could significantly reduce both the abundance of ammonia oxidizers and potential nitrification rates. The AOA may play a more important role than AOB in nitrification in desert soil.",

The experiment consisted of three factors: (1) amount of phosphorus (P) fertilizer (0, 1 and 2\u00a0g kg\u22121); (2) type of Se fertilizer (selenate and selenite); and (3) amount of Se fertilizer (0, 1 and 2\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121). The results indicate that P fertilizer significantly increased wheat biomass. Selenite significantly reduced wheat biomass, whereas the effects of selenate were not significant. In the selenite treatments, P fertilizer significantly reduced soil pH, causing declines in soluble soil Se and exchangeable Se and increases in iron (Fe) oxide-bound Se and organic matter-bound Se. The Se accumulation coefficient, the Se translocation coefficient and the Se content of wheat roots, stems, leaves and spikes all declined when P was applied to selenite-fertilized soil. ...",

It is important to understand the response of the soil microbial community and diversity to saline irrigation water. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of irrigation water salinity and nitrogen fertilization rates on soil physicochemical properties, microbial activity, microbial biomass, and microbial functional diversity. The field experiment consisted of a factorial design with three levels of irrigation water salinity (electrical conductivities (ECs) of 0.35, 4.61 or 8.04\u2005dS\u2005m\u22121) and two nitrogen rates (0 and 360\u2005kg\u2005N\u2005ha\u22121). The results showed that the 4.61 and 8.04\u2005dS\u2005m\u22121 treatments both reduced soil microbial biomass C (MBC), microbial biomass N (MBN), basal respiration, total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), bacterial PLFA, fungal PLFA, and fungal:bacterial ratios. In contrast, the SW treatments increased the MBC:MBN ratio. Nitrogen fertilization increased soil MBC, MBN, basal respira...",

        "abstract": "Our previous findings showed a good therapeutic effect of the combination of suicide gene HSV-TK, nuclide 131I, and magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) on hepatoma by using magnetic nanoparticles as linkers, far better than any monotherapy involved, with no adverse effects. This combination therapy might be an eligible strategy to treat hepatic cancer. However, it is not clear how the combination regimen took the therapeutic effects. In the current study, to explore the possible mechanisms of radionuclide-gene therapy combined with MFH to treat hepatoma at tissue, cellular, and molecular levels and to provide theoretical and experimental data for its clinical application, we examined the apoptosis induction of the combination therapy and investigated the expression of the proteins related to apoptosis such as survivin, livin, bcl-2, p53, and nucleus protein Ki67 involved in cell proliferation, detected VEGF, and MVD involved in angiogenesis of tumor tissues and analyzed the pathologic changes after treatment. The results showed that the combination therapy significantly induced the hepatoma cell apoptosis. The expression of survivin, VEGF, bcl-2, p53, livin, Ki67, and VEGF proteins and microvascular density (MVD) were all decreased after treatment. The therapeutic mechanisms may be involved in the downregulation of Ki67 expression leading to tumor cell proliferation repression and inhibition of survivin, bcl-2, p53, and livin protein expression inducing tumor cell apoptosis, negatively regulating VEGF protein expression, and reducing vascular endothelial cells, which results in tumor angiogenesis inhibition and microvascular density decrease and tumor cell necrosis. These findings offer another basic data support and theoretical foundation for the clinical application of the combination therapy.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays an important role in tumorigenesis. However, the function and regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs are still unclear in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). To address this challenge, we screened lncRNAs expression profiles in 3 pairs of ESCC and matched non-cancerous tissues by microarray assay and identified the relationship between lncRNAs expression in ESCC tissue and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with ESCC. We found 182 lncRNAs that were significantly differently expressed in ESCC tissues versus the matched non-cancerous tissues. Gene ontology and pathway analysis results suggested that the primary biological processes of these genes were involved in extracellular matrix, immune responses, cell differentiation and cell proliferation. Through cis and trans analyzing, we found 4\u00a0lncRNAs (ENST00000480669, NONHSAT104436, NONHSAT126998 and NONHSAT112918) may play important roles in tumorigenesis of ESCC. The four lncRNAs were checked in 73\u00a0patients with ESCC. The results showed that they mainly related to tumor metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that high expression of NONHSAT104436, NONHSAT126998 and low expression of ENST00000480669 were related to poor 3-year overall survival (P=0.003, 0.032 and 0.040, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that NONHSAT104436 was an independent prognostic factor (P=0.017). Thus we concluded that, lncRNAs showed differently expression patterns in ESCC versus matched non-cancerous tissues, and aberrantly expressed lncRNA may play important roles in ESCC development and progression. Interestingly, the overexpression of NONHSAT104436 was tightly correlated with distant metastasis and, poor survival rate, which might indicate that NONHSAT104436 might play a very important part in ESCC tumor progression.

After constructing the ANXA1 overexpression plasmid, we transfected this plasmid and/or microRNA\u00a0(miRNA)\u2011196a\u00a0mimic into ESCC cells\u00a0(Eca109\u00a0cell line). Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium\u00a0(MTT) assay and Transwell chamber assay were performed to determine cell proliferation, migration and invasion, respectively. Western blot analysis was used to examine the protein expression levels of ANXA1, Snail and E-cadherin. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of miRNA-196a. Our results revealed that ANXA1 expression was upregulated in the cells transfected with the ANXA1 overexpression plasmid, and cell proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly increased\u00a0(p=0.004,\u00a0p<0.001 and\u00a0p=0.011, respectively). In the cells transfected with the miRNA\u2011196a\u00a0mimic, miRNA\u2011196a expression was significantly upregulated\u00a0(p<0.001). However, miRNA-196a expression was downregulated in the cells transfected with the ANXA1 overexpression plasmid. In addition, in the cells transfected with the miRNA\u2011196a\u00a0mimic, cell proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly decreased\u00a0(p=0.027,\u00a0p=0.009 and\u00a0p=0.021, respectively). In the cells transfected with the ANXA1 overexpression plasmid, the expression of Snail was upregulated and that of E-cadherin was downregulated. However, the opposite was observed in the cells transfected with the miRNA\u2011196a\u00a0mimic. Our findings thus demonstrate that ANXA1 promotes the proliferation of Eca109\u00a0cells, and increases the expression of Snail, whereas it inhibits that of E-cadherin, thus enhancing the migration and invasion of ESCC cells. miRNA-196a negatively regulates the expression of ANXA1, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of ESCC cells.",

        "abstract": "The present study evaluated the role of annexin A1 (ANXA1) in the treatment of acute radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) and investigated the mechanism of its action. The expression of ANXA1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the plasma of patients with RILI prior to and following hormonotherapy was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association of plasma ANXA1 concentration with clinical effect, and the correlation between the expression of ANXA1 and that of IL-6 and MPO were evaluated. ANXA1 was overexpressed or knocked down in a macrophage cell line, and its impact on IL-6 and MPO expression was measured. Following glucocorticoid hormonotherapy, patients with RILI exhibited a higher plasma concentration of ANXA1 compared with that prior to treatment, while IL-6 and MPO levels were lower. The concentration of ANXA1 in plasma was negatively correlated with IL-6 and MPO levels, with a correlation coefficient of -0.492 and -0.437, respectively (P<0.001). The increasing concentration of ANXA1 in plasma following treatment was associated with the clinical effect in patients with RILI (P=0.007). The expression levels of of IL-6 and MPO were inhibited both in the cytoplasm and in the culture solution, when ANXA1 expression was upregulated in a macrophage cell line. In conclusion, ANXA1 inhibited the synthesis and secretion of IL-6 and MPO inflammatory cytokines, indicating that ANXA1 may have therapeutic potential as a treatment target for RILI.",

The shared software and hardware resources and information can be provided to the computers and other equipments according to the demands of users. A majority of services are deployed through outsourcing. Outsourcing computation allows resource-constrained clients to outsource their complex computation workloads to a powerful server which is rich of computation resources. Modular exponentiation is one of the most complex computations in public key based cryptographic schemes. It is useful to reduce the computation cost of the clients by using outsourcing computation. In this paper, we propose a novel outsourcing algorithm for modular exponentiation based on the new mathematical division under the setting of two non-colluding cloud servers.

With the development of cloud computing, the importance of security issues is increasing. Modular exponentiations are one of the basic and expensive operations of public key cryptography. We consider the single untrusted programed model of modular exponentiations outsourcing algorithm in this paper. A new secure outsourcing of modular exponentiations scheme is proposed under this model. In this scheme, a new logical split method about modular exponentiation is put forward. The modular exponentiation is divided into several parts and a random value is kept for verification. The exponent and the base of modular exponentiations are keeping privacy in the process of outsourcing. The computational burden for users in the process of outsourcing is small, and the users can verify the results with high checkability.",

Outsourcing computation allows a resource-constrained client to outsource the complicated computing tasks to a cloud server which is powerful but not honest. Modular exponentiation with a large modulus, which is considered as the most expensive operation in discrete logarithm based cryptographic protocols, has been widely used in public key cryptosystems for secure data communications. In this paper we put forth a new improved outsourcing algorithm for secure outsourcing of modular exponentiations. In the proposed algorithm, the modular exponentiations need to be computed are hidden to the malicious server. In the computation procedure, the server cannot obtain any information with respect to the input and output while the client can verify the returned result efficiently. Compared with the algorithms of Hohenberger and Lysyanskaya 2005 and Chen et al. 2012, ours are superior in checkability. In addition, the proposed algorithm can promote the efficiency of all security protocols based on discrete logarithm.",

MCC integrates the cloud computing into the mobile environment and has been introduced to be a potential technology for mobile devices. Although mobile devices brought us lots of convenience, it is still difficult or impossible to perform some expensive tasks due to the limited resources such as computing abilities, battery lifetime, processing abilities, and storage capacity. Therefore, many researchers focus on designing applications which could run on mobile devices in mobile cloud computing. Among them, secure encrypted image search has attracted considerable interest recently. However, it also suffers from some challenges such as privacy of images, and distance matching over ciphertexts. In this paper, we introduce a novel encryption search scheme for content-based image retrieval using comparable encryption and order-preserving encryption technology. Because of avoiding the usage of the homomorphic encryption, our construction greatly reduces computation overhead on client side and improves the precision of fuzzy search compared with previous solutions.",

Recently, Furukawa (Computer security-ESORICS 2013, Springer, 129---146, 2013) introduced a new primitive called request-based comparable encryption (comparable encryption for short) which overcomes the problem that OPEs cannot solve. OPEs have the problem that when all the numbers in a certain domain are encrypted by an OPE, an attacker can easily obtain all the orders of the encrypted numbers and hence retrieve the original numbers. However, comparable encryption is not efficient enough both in storage and in computation workload. Comparable encryption based on sliding window method Ko\u00e7 in Comput Math Appl 30:17---24, 1995 can adaptively adjust the window size to achieve a high performance. We set the window size as a constant number to conveniently generate ciphertexts and compare with others. Besides, the proposed scheme allows the users to obtain a variable trade-off between security and efficiency through adaptively setting the window size.",

However, it might be insecure to upload the plaintext directly to the remote cloud server. In order to solve the problem, the data should be encrypted by a secure encryption scheme. Most existing data sharing schemes in cloud computing are either insecure against collusion attack or suffer from a large computational overhead. In this paper, an efficient data sharing scheme in cloud computing for mobile devices is proposed based on convergent encryption and polynomial reconstruction techniques. Moreover, predecryption is used to further reduce the computation overhead of mobile devices.

Its derivation is based on common periodic impulsive noises measurements and analyses and on using superposition method and unit periodic rectangular square wave weighting method. The results show that the model can accurately simulate the shape of time domain and the frequency components of RPIN in 10 KHz-30 MHz.",

We studied the relationship between CIMT and DAI in Chinese population. 65 outpatients (26 males and 39 females) aged 24\u201378 years (51\u00b119 years) recruited from carotid ultrasound examination room were taken into the study. We used a tonometric device (IIM-2010A to measure DAI, pules wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI), and a Sonosite Micromax ultrasound unit to measure CIMT. CIMT was negatively correlated with DAI (r=\u22120.636, Pu003c0.01), and positively relevant with PWV and AI (r=0.396 and r=0.596, Pu003c0.01 for both). DAI was negatively related to AI (r=\u22120.522 and Pu003c0.001). Age, PWV and DAI were independent predictors of CIMT, while age, CIMT and central blood pressure were independent predictors of DAI. CIMT was age-dependent and significantly related to DAI besides other parameters for arterial stiffness including PWV and AI.",

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to derivate and validate score models to predict the risk of diabetes among urban Chinese men and women. Participants included 26,600 men (47.64 \u00b1 7.86 years) and 9,600 women (47.89 \u00b1 8.30 years), and were respectively divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to select and weigh variables in the derivation cohorts. The validity of the models was tested by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in validation cohorts, and compared with the Chinese Diabetes Risk Score (CDRS) and Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) models. Both male and female mathematical models were established to calculate the diabetes risk-score in urban Chinese. The estimated AUC for the male model was 0.920 (95% CI 0.909\u20130.930) at a cut-off point of u003e1871. The performance of the male model was superior to the CDRS and FINDRISC models. The estimated AUC for the female model was 0.924 (95% CI 0.905\u20130.940) at a cut-off point of u003e2127. The performance of the female model was superior to the CDRS, but slightly inferior to the FINDRISC. The male and female models could help determine individuals at high risk of diabetes in the urban Chinese population.",

Obesity is a strong risk factor of many cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and will bring burdens to the life of overweight and obese people. Research showed that most overweight and obesity were caused by unhealthy lifestyle. Therefore, a comprehensive lifestyle intervention based on physical activity, diet and psychology is crucial in the management of overweight and obese people. This study reviewed the current situation of overweight and obesity management strategies, means of interventions and the possible interaction between those interventions. The present study also introduced the diet and exercise prescription of overweight and obese people, and the individualized management scheme for different personal situation. At last, we summarized the shortcomings and difficulties of the present management strategies and propose several key points of management in overweight and obese people according to the demand of individualized management.",

Nonlinear optical (NLO) studies using the Z-scan technique revealed that both the cyano (CN) and the dimethylamino (DMA) substituents have a positive effect in optimizing the optical limiting performance of the SWCNT\u2013porphyrin nanohybrids, owing to increased reverse saturable absorption (RSA) of the porphyrin moieties after functionalization by CN or DMA. In comparison with CN, the DMA group has a more positive influence on the porphyrin excited states and thereby the RSA and NLO activity.",

Blue thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) devices using these new hosts and 2CzPN as the host\u2013guest system exhibited efficient electroluminescence efficiencies of 38 cd A\u22121/30 lm W\u22121/17%, which are among the best for 2CzPN-based TADF devices. The generality of this synthetic strategy to high-ET fluorene-coupled D\u2013\u03c3\u2013A type hosts was confirmed by successfully appending other D/A groups ((diphenylamino)phenyl/phenylsulfonyl) to fluorene, affording TPAFBSO.",

Combined with a strong electron-withdrawing group of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, a novel red fluorophore BTZPP was synthesized. The solution-processed red-emitting device based on BTZPP showed encouraging performances with external quantum efficiency of up to 3.4%. This evidently indicates that the pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole group can be a promising electron-donating moiety for enriching the material types and promoting the development of OLEDs.",

Considering their bipolar transporting properties, exciplex systems with strong blue fluorescence and high triplet energies could potentially be ideal hosts for fluorescence\u2013phosphorescence hybrid (F\u2013P) white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs). Here we achieved an efficient blue exciplex system formed with a new material (4-dimesitylboryl)phenyltriphenylamine (TPAPB) and 1,3,5-tri(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)phenyl (TPBi), which exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 44.1%. Using only these two organic materials, a high performance blue-emitting OLED was fabricated with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.0 \u00b1 0.4%. Such high efficiency is not only among the highest results of blue fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) but also indicates that high \u03c7 (fraction of excitons that can potentially radiatively decay) can be as well achieved via a TTA triplet up-conversion p...",

        "abstract": "A series of locally twisted dual-functional materials namely PIPT, PITT and PIFT have been designed and synthesized by introducing different polyaromatic hydrocarbon groups to a phenanthroimidazole backbone through a thiophene bridge. In these molecules, the thiophene bridge and phenanthroimidazole platform are nearly coplanar and this endows these materials with relatively shallow HOMO levels (-5.35 to -5.21 eV). On the other hand, the bulky polyaromatic hydrocarbon units introduce non-planar twisty structures which reduce molecular aggregations. These three materials show color-tunable emission (emission peak from 468 to 532 nm in film) and high thermal stability (T-g > 160 degrees C). Simple trilayer devices using these three phenanthroimidazole derivatives as non-doped emitting layers exhibit low turn-on voltages (2.3-2.7 V) and high maximum efficiencies of 3.74, 6.15 and 6.89 cd/A for PIPT, PITT and PIFT, respectively. Above all, owing to their shallow HOMO levels for enabling efficient hole-injection, even simpler bilayer devices employing these materials as hole-transporting emitters show low turn-on voltages (2.6-2.8 V) and high efficiencies of 5.77 cd/A for PIPT, 6.03 cd/A for PITT and 6.04 cd/A for PIFT, respectively. These comparable performances with those of the trilayer configurations show the efficient hole-injection/transport ability of these three newly developed emitters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, this assumption is not suitable for the practical applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a new algorithm with the consideration of inconsistent manifold between HR and LR images. In the proposed method, LR dictionary and spare representation coefficient set are trained first. Then, HR dictionary can be obtained based on HR sample set and spare representation coefficients which are obtained in the first step. PCA algorithm is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of LR feature image to reduce the dictionary training time. A global optimization algorithm is provided to eliminate the blocking effect of the reconstruction image. Results show that the proposed method can reduce training time rapidly and improve the quality of reconstruction image in the aspects of both objective evaluation and subjective visual effect.",

However, due to the noisy and irrelevant features of the data samples, the affinity graph constructed directly from the original feature space is not necessarily a reliable reflection of the intrinsic manifold of the data samples. To overcome this problem, we integrate feature selection into the construction of the data (feature) graph and propose a novel algorithm called adaptive dual-graph regularized CF with Feature selection $$(\\\\hbox {ADGCF}_{\\\\mathrm{FS}})$$(ADGCFFS), which simultaneously considers the geometric structures of both the data manifold and the feature manifold. We unify feature selections, dual-graph regularized CF into a joint objective function and minimize this objective function with iterative and alternative updating optimization schemes. Moreover, we provide the convergence proof of our optimization scheme. Experimental results on TDT2 and Reuters document datasets, COIL20 and PIE image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Existing matrix factorization based techniques, such as nonnegative matrix factorization and concept factorization, have been widely applied for data representation. In order to make the obtained concepts to be as close to the original data points as possible, one state-of-the-art method called locality constraint concept factorization is put forward, which represent the data by a linear combination of only a few nearby basis concepts. But its locality constraint does not well reveal the intrinsic data structure since it only requires the concept to be as close to the original data points as possible. To address these problems, by considering the manifold geometrical structure in local concept factorization via graph-based learning, we propose a novel algorithm, called graph-regularized local coordinate concept factorization (GRLCF). By constructing a parameter-free graph using constrained Laplacian rank (CLR) algorithm, we also present an extension of GRLCF algorithm as . Moreover, we develop the iterative updating optimization schemes, and provide the convergence proof of our optimization scheme. Since GRLCF simultaneously considers the geometric structures of the data manifold and the locality conditions as additional constraints, it can obtain more compact and better structured data representation. Experimental results on ORL, Yale and Mnist image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Morphotectonic analysis of the inside corner intersection (14.0\u00b0S) between the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Cardno fracture zone indicate a young rough massif emerging after the termination of a previous oceanic core complex. The massif, which hosts an off-axis hydrothermal field, is characterized by a magmatic inactive volcanic structure, based on geologic mapping and sample studies. Mineralogical analyses show that the prominent hydrothermal deposit was characterized by massive pyrite-marcasite breccias with silica-rich gangue minerals. Geochemical analyses of the sulfide breccias indicate two element groups: the Fe-rich ore mineral group and silica-rich gangue mineral group. Rare earth element distribution patterns showing coexistence of positive Eu anomalies and negative Ce anomalies suggest that sulfides were precipitated from diffused discharge resulted from mixing between seawater and vent fluids. Different from several low temperature hydrothermal systems occurring on other intersection dome-like massifs that are recognized as detachment fault surfaces associated with variably metamorphosed ultramafic rocks, the 14.0\u00b0S field, hosted in gabbroic-basaltic substrate, is inferred to be of a high temperature system and likely to be driven by deep high temperature gabbroic intrusions.

        "abstract": "Abstract Fresh rocks sampled from the 14.0\u00b0S hydrothermal field of the South Atlantic Ridge can be divided into two categories: olivine-gabbro and basalt. The olivine-gabbro is composed mainly of three types of minerals: olivine, clinopyroxene and plagioclase, while a multitude of melt inclusions occur in the plagioclase phenocrysts of the basalts. We analyzed the whole-rock, major and trace elements contents of the basalts, the mineral chemistry of phenocrysts and melt inclusions in the basalts, and the mineral chemistry of olivine-clinopyroxene-plagioclase in the olivine-gabbro, then simulated magma evolution within the crust using the COMAGMAT program. The whole-rock geochemistry shows that all the basalts exhibit typical N-MORB characteristics. In addition, the mineral chemistry characteristics of the olivine-gabbro (low-Fo olivine, low-Mg# clinopyroxene, high-TiO2 clinopyroxene, low-An plagioclase), show that strong magma differentiation occurred within the crust. Nevertheless, significant discrepancies between those minerals and phenocrysts in the basalts (high-Fo olivine, high-An plagioclase) reflect the heterogeneity of magma differentiation. High Mg# (\u22480.72) melt inclusions isobaric partial crystallization simulations suggest that the magma differentiation occurred at the depth shallower than 13.03 km below the seafloor, and both the vertical differentiation column shows distinct discrepancies from that of a steady-state magma chamber. Instead, a series of independent magma intrusions probably occurred within the crust, and their corresponding crystallized bodies, as the primary high-temperature thermal anomalies within the off-axis crust, probably act as the heat source for the development of the 14.0\u00b0S hydrothermal system.",

        "abstract": "At the inside corner between the South Mid-Atlantic Ridge (SMAR) and the Cardno fracture zone, the 14\u00b0S hydrothermal field, with its abundant silica-rich sulfides, was identified as a volcanic massif, which provided the first opportunity to study inside corner-related hydrothermal mineralization. S, Pb, and O isotopes were measured in hydrothermal sulfide samples from the two sites (volcanic top and slope sites) in the 14\u00b0S field. The homogeneous Pb isotope values (207Pb/204Pb\u2009=\u200915.466\u2009\u2212\u200915.472; 206Pb/204Pb\u2009=\u200918.242\u2009\u2212\u200918.252) and the \u03b434S values (top site, +6.3 to +6.85\u2030; slope site, +2.37 to +3.36\u2030) suggest that the source of metals and most of the sulfur is the upper crust, whereas some sulfur is sourced from downward-penetrating seawater, especially in the top site. The calculated oxygen isotope equilibration temperatures from quartz and seawater are between 94 and 144\u00b0C for the top site and between 179 and 196\u00b0C for the slope site. These isotopic proxies, together with geological background survey data, have an important implication: Discrepancies between the sites may result from variations in crust permeability, which also affect the mixing level between downward-penetrating seawater and upward hydrothermal end-member fluids and determine the various mineralization types.",

        "abstract": "The use of biochar in agricultural soils has received increasing attention over the last decade and enhancing biochar through chemical modification offers a strategy to reduce the amount of biochar required for improving soil productivity. However there is limited knowledge on how mineral enhanced biochars alone, or in combination with conventional fertilisers impact on microbial processes and edaphic parameters of soil or the root, and how this influences agricultural yield in the long-term. To investigate this we assessed crop yield, edaphic parameters and microbial communities within the bulk soil and on roots at the end of the third crop-cycle from a long-term agricultural trial where pre-existing enhanced biochar applications (from previous crop-cycles) totalled between 0 and 5.5 t ha and were then supplemented with fresh enhanced biochar (0.1 t ha) and traditional N fertiliser (50 kg ha) in a crossed design. We found an array of effects associated with existing and new enhanced biochar applications in conjunction with N fertiliser on plant yield, soil nutrients and microbial communities. Yield decreased up to 27% with any soil amendment and was greatest in the unamended control. Soil nitrate increased from 30.4 to 59.6 mg kg due to N fertiliser with little effect of the enhanced biochar. Soil pH increased from 4.59 to 4.86 due to previously applied enhanced biochar and was associated with applications of at least 1 t ha. There were differing responses in the microbial communities between bulk soil (294 taxa changes) and roots (383 taxa changes) to the fertilisation regimes, which were unrelated to the nitrate content in the soil and appeared to be driven by pH changes, especially for communities associated with plant roots. This has important implications on which soil compartments should be investigated in future studies of microbial communities. The short- and long-term effects of enhanced biochar observed here question the relevance of studies examining once-off applications of biochar and their extrapolation to real world scenarios i.e. where sequential application of biochar might occur. It is likely that responses of agricultural systems may depend on the historical use of biochar.",

Herein, we present DeepRT, a deep learning based software for peptide retention time prediction. DeepRT automatically learns features directly from the peptide sequences using the deep convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, which eliminates the need to use hand-crafted features or rules. After the feature learning, principal component analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, then three conventional machine learning methods were utilized to perform modeling. Two published datasets were used to evaluate the performance of DeepRT and we demonstrate that DeepRT greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches ELUDE and GPTime.",

        "abstract": "A fully automatic prediction for peptide retention time (RT) in liquid chromatography (LC), termed as DeepRT, was developed using deep learning approach, an ensemble of Residual Network (ResNet) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). In contrast to the traditional predictor based on the hand-crafted features for peptides, DeepRT learns features from raw amino acid sequences and makes relatively accurate prediction of peptide RTs with 0.987 R2 for unmodified peptides. Furthermore, by virtue of transfer learning, DeepRT enables utilization of the peptides datasets generated from different LC conditions and of different modification status, resulting in the RT prediction of 0.992 R2 for unmodified peptides and 0.978 R2 for post-translationally modified peptides. Even though chromatographic behaviors of peptides are quite complicated, the study here demonstrated that peptide RT prediction could be largely improved by deep transfer learning.

        "abstract": "Computational prediction of compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is of great importance for drug design as the first step in in-silico screening. We previously proposed chemical genomics-based virtual screening (CGBVS), which predicts CPIs by using a support vector machine (SVM). However, the CGBVS has problems when training using more than a million datasets of CPIs since SVMs require an exponential increase in the calculation time and computer memory. To solve this problem, we propose the CGBVS-DNN, in which we use deep neural networks, a kind of deep learning technique, instead of the SVM. Deep learning does not require learning all input data at once because the network can be trained with small mini-batches. Experimental results show that the CGBVS-DNN outperformed the original CGBVS with a quarter million CPIs. Results of cross-validation show that the accuracy of the CGBVS-DNN reaches up to 98.2\u2009% (\u03c3<0.01) with 4\u2005million CPIs.",

        "abstract": "RFC (reduced folate carrier) is the major transporter for reduced folates and antifolates [e.g. MTX (methotrexate)]. RFC is characterized by two halves, each with six TMD (transmembrane domain) alpha helices connected by a hydrophilic loop, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini. We previously identified TMDs 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 11 as forming the hydrophilic cavity for translocation of (anti)folates. The proximal end of TMD8 (positions 311-314) was implicated in substrate binding from scanning-cysteine accessibility methods; cysteine replacement of Ser313 resulted in loss of transport. In the present study, Ser313 was mutated to alanine, cysteine, phenylalanine and threonine. Mutant RFCs were expressed in RFC-null R5 HeLa cells. Replacement of Ser313 with cysteine or phenylalanine abolished MTX transport, whereas residual activity was preserved for the alanine and threonine mutants. In stable K562 transfectants, S313A and S313T RFCs showed substantially decreased Vmax values without changes in Kt values for MTX compared with wild-type RFC. S313A and S313T RFCs differentially impacted binding of ten diverse (anti)folate substrates. Cross-linking between TMD8 and TMD5 was studied by expressing cysteine-less TMD1-6 (N6) and TMD7-12 (C6) half-molecules with cysteine insertions spanning these helices in R5 cells, followed by treatment with thiol-reactive homobifunctional cross-linkers. C6-C6 and N6-N6 cross-links were seen for all cysteine pairs. From the N6 and C6 cysteine pairs, Cys175/Cys311 was cross-linked; cross-linking increased in the presence of transport substrates. The results of the present study indicate that the proximal end of TMD8 is juxtaposed to TMD5 and is conformationally active in the presence of transport substrates, and TMD8, including Ser313, probably contributes to the RFC substrate-binding domain.",

        "abstract": "The proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT; SLC46A1) is a folate-proton symporter expressed in solid tumors and is used for tumor-targeted delivery of cytotoxic antifolates. Topology modeling suggests that PCFT secondary structure includes twelve transmembrane domains (TMDs) with TMDs 6 and 7 linked by an intracellular loop (positions 236 to 265) including His247, implicated as functionally important. Single cysteine mutants were inserted from positions 241 to 251 in cysteine-less PCFT and mutant proteins were expressed in PCFT-null (R1-11) HeLa cells; none were reactive with 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate biotin, suggesting that the TMD6-7 loop is intracellular. Twenty-nine single alanine mutants spanning the entire TMD6-7 loop were expressed in R1-11 cells; activity was generally preserved, with the exception of the 247, 250 and 251 mutants, partly due to decreased surface expression. Co-expression of PCFT TMD1-6 and TMD7-12 half-molecules in R1-11 cells partially restored transport activity, although removal of residues 252-265 from TMD7-12 abolished transport. Chimeric proteins, including non-homologous sequence from a thiamine transporter (ThTr1) inserted into the PCFT TMD6-7 loop (positions 236 to 250, or 251 to 265), were active, although replacement of the entire loop with ThTr1 sequence resulted in substantial loss of activity. Amino acid replacements (Ala, Arg, His, Gln, Glu) or deletions at position 247 in wild-type and PCFT-ThTr1 chimeras resulted in differential effects on transport. Collectively, our findings suggest that the PCFT TMD6-7 connecting loop confers protein stability and may serve a unique functional role that depends on secondary structure rather than particular sequence elements.",

A 442-W linearly polarized output with a narrow 3-dB linewidth of 0.28 nm and a 621-W linearly polarized output with a relatively wider 3-dB linewidth of 2.7 nm are realized. Besides, near-diffraction-limited beam quality and high polarization extinction ratio are obtained in both situations, and further power scaling is limited by the onset of mode instability (MI). To the best of our knowledge, these results are highest output powers of linearly polarized RFLs for the time being, in the narrow-linewidth and wide-linewidth situations, respectively. Meanwhile, the differences in the spectral broadening factor and the MI threshold between the narrow-linewidth linearly polarized RFL and the wide-linewidth one are discovered and discussed for the first time. It is experimentally demonstrated that relatively wider linewidth of the RFL seed is in favor of reducing the spectral broadening and increasing the MI threshold, providing significant reference for power scaling of linearly polarized RFL.",

        "abstract": "A narrow-linewidth Q-switched random fiber laser (RFL) based on a half-opened cavity, which is realized by narrow-linewidth fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and a section of 3 km passive fiber, has been proposed and experimentally investigated. The narrow-linewidth lasing is generated by the spectral filtering of three FBGs with linewidth of 1.21 nm, 0.56 nm, and 0.12 nm, respectively. The Q switching of the distributed cavity is achieved by placing an acousto-optical modulator (AOM) between the FBG and the passive fiber. The maximal output powers of the narrow-linewidth RFLs with the three different FBGs are 0.54 W, 0.27 W, and 0.08 W, respectively. Furthermore, the repetition rates of the output pulses are 500 kHz, and the pulse durations are about 500 ns. The corresponding pulse energies are about 1.08 \u03bcJ, 0.54 \u03bcJ, and 0.16 \u03bcJ, accordingly. The linewidth of FBG can influence the output characteristics in full scale. The narrower the FBG, the higher the pump threshold; the lower the output power at the same pump level, the more serious the linewidth broadening; and thus the higher the proportion of the CW-ground exists in the output pulse trains. Thanks to the assistance of the band-pass filter (BPF), the proportion of the CW-ground of narrow-linewidth Q-switched RFL under the relative high-pump-low-output condition can be reduced effectively. The experimental results indicate that it is challenging to demonstrate a narrow-linewidth Q-switched RFL with high quality output. But further power scaling and linewidth narrowing is possible in the case of operating parameters, optimization efforts, and a more powerful pump source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of narrow-linewidth generation in a Q-switched RFL. ",

        "abstract": "Fiber lasers with flexible spectral manipulation property could provide a flexible tool for scenes where the temporal coherence property accounts, for example, coherent sensing/communication and nonlinear frequency conversion. Due to the good laser performance and relative simplicity of implementation, random fiber lasers (RFLs) based on random distributed feedback and Raman gain have earned more and more attention in the past few years, and a variety of RFLs with substantially different spectral properties have been developed. In this presentation, we demonstrate a high power linearly polarized RFL with flexible spectral manipulation property, in which the central wavelength and the linewidth of the spectrum can be tuned independently through a bandwidth-adjustable tunable optical filter (BA-TOF). The central wavelength of the RFL can be continuously tuned from 1095 to 1115\u2009nm, while the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) linewidth has a maximal tuning range from ~0.6 to more than 2\u2009nm. Moreover, the output power of 1102.5-1112.5\u2009nm reaches ~23\u2009W with polarization extinction ratio (PER) value\u2009>\u200920\u2009dB.

In this Letter, we report on a high-power, high-spectral-purity random Raman fiber laser based on tapered fiber, in which the four-wave mixing (FWM) effect has been sufficiently suppressed. By choosing an appropriate tapered fiber length, we achieve a maximum random laser output of 491\u00a0W, and the spectral purity can reach to as high as 94%. We carefully compare the influence of different tapered fiber lengths and splicing patterns on the FWM effect by the cutting-back method and lateral-offset splicing. The results show that the transverse modes dispersion is responsible for the appearance of FWM by compensating the phase mismatch. It is believed that a kilowatt-level random laser can be obtained by further optimizing the parameters of tapered fiber.",

One of the most widely-studied fields is to improve the optical efficiency and the output power. However, the power scaling of a random fiber laser is instinctively restricted by the high order Stokes generation. In this manuscript, we propose a simple yet effective method, which employs a homemade all-fiber Lyot filter to manipulate the polarization dependent Raman gain, thus increasing the threshold of the 2nd-order Stokes wave and enhancing the maximum output power of the linearly polarized random fiber laser. Through reliable theoretical analysis, we optimize the design of the wavelength dependent Lyot filter. Moreover, the performance of the filter and the power scaling capability of the linearly polarized random fiber laser are investigated in detail. A proof-of-principle experiment is carried out by inserting the homemade Lyot filter into a half-opened random fiber laser. The experimental results indicate that the 2nd-order Stokes wave can be effectively suppressed, and the maximum output power of the 1st-order Stokes wave is significantly increased with a range of ~50% (from 43.6 to 63.2 W).",

Spectral linewidth down to 42.31 GHz is achieved through filtering by the FBG. When 8.97 W pump light centered at the optimized wavelength 1036.5 nm is launched into the half-open cavity, 1081.4 nm random lasing with the maximum output power of 2.15 W is achieved, which is more powerful than the previous reported results.",

The RFL based on a half-opened cavity, which is composed of a linearly polarized narrow-linewidth fiber Bragg grating and a 500\u00a0m piece of polarization-maintained Ge-doped fiber, generates a 0.71\u00a0W seed laser with an 88\u00a0pm full width at half-maximum (FWHM) linewidth and a 22.5\u00a0dB polarization extinction ratio (PER) for power scaling. A two-stage fiber amplifier enhances the seed laser to the maximal 1.01\u00a0kW with a PER value of 17\u00a0dB and a beam quality of Mx2=1.15 and My2=1.13. No stimulated Brillouin scattering effect is observed at the ultimate power level, and the FWHM linewidth of the amplified random laser broadens linearly as a function of the output power with a coefficient of about 0.1237\u2009\u2009pm/W. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a linearly polarized narrow-linewidth RFL with even kilowatt-level near-diffraction-limited output, and further performance scaling is ongoing.",

        "abstract": "In this manuscript, we demonstrate an all-fiberized master-oscillation-power-amplifier (MOPA) structured linearly-polarized narrowband random laser. The seed source is a narrowband random-polarized random fiber laser (RFL) in a half-opened cavity with a maximum output power of 0.981 W and a linewidth of 0.1 nm. Utilizing a polarization-dependent isolator as a polarizer, a linearly-polarized narrowband seed laser can be obtained. As for the main amplifier, a pump-limited 381.1 W amplified linearly-polarized narrowband random laser can be achieved with a linewidth of 0.13 nm (33.36 GHz) and a polarization degree of 92.33% (~11 dB). The performance of the system is limited by the generation of mode instability (MI) effects, and hence, the worsening of temporal stability and the reduction of beam quality. Furthermore, significant tail broadening of the output spectrum can be measured. As the output and backward powers increase monotonously with the boosting of pump power, we conclude that further power scaling of this system with good linewidth, polarization, beam quality and temporal stability performance can be achieved with effective mitigation of the MI effect. This work can expand our comprehension on the spectral evolution property of RFL in the power scaling process and provide a possible solution for the obtaining of powerful linearly-polarized narrowband fiber source.",

Furthermore, this powerful linearly-polarized high-order RFL also obtains the highest quantum efficiency (86.43 %) for the 2nd order Stokes light.

        "abstract": "In this contribution, we present the tandem pumping avenue leveraged performance scaling of random fiber laser to record 3 kW level with inherent temporal stability and near-diffraction-limited beam quality. The high power system employs a four-stage master oscillator power amplifier chain. The master oscillator is a half-opened cavity structured random distributed feedback fiber laser centered at 1080 nm and pumped by incoherent amplified spontaneous emission source. Narrowband random laser seed is selected by employing a spectral filtering module with a maximum output power of 1.08 W, full width at half maximum linewidth of 0.47 nm and spectral optical-signal-to-noise ratio of about 42 dB. As to the main amplification stage, for given 104 W pre-amplified random laser seed and 3.61 kW pump laser, an ultimate output power of 3.03 kW can be obtained, corresponding to an optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 81.05%. Nearly single-transverse-mode amplified random laser can be achieved even at full power level for inherent high thermal modal instability threshold enabled by tandem pumping and inducing bending loss for high-order transverse-mode. Further performance scaling of this high power random laser system, such as power boosting, operation wavelength tuning and linewidth alteration, is the next goal.",

However, up to now, optical RW behavior with temporally localized structure has yet not been presented in random fiber laser (RFL) characterized with mirrorless open cavity, whose feedback arises from distinctive distributed multiple scattering. Here, thanks to the participation of sustained and crucial stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) process, experimental explorations of optical RW are done in the highly-skewed transient intensity of an incoherently-pumped standard-telecom-fiber-constructed RFL. Furthermore, threshold-like beating peak behavior can also been resolved in the radiofrequency spectroscopy. Bringing the concept of optical RW to RFL domain without fixed cavity may greatly extend our comprehension of the rich and complex kinetics such as photon propagation and localization in disordered amplifying media with multiple scattering.",

In this presentation, we demonstrate a powerful linearly polarized RFL with spectral adjustment, in which the central wavelength and the linewidth of the spectrum can be tuned independently through a bandwidth-adjustable tunable optical filter (BA-TOF). As a result, the central wavelength can be continuously tuned from 1095 to 1115 nm, while the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) linewidth has a maximal tuning range from ~0.6 to more than 2 nm. This laser provides a flexible tool for scenes where the temporal coherence property accounts, such as coherent sensing/communication and nonlinear frequency conversion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a high power linearly polarized RFL with both wavelength and linewidth tunability.",

Two types of fibers were selected to fabricate the FBG pair in order to match the reflection peaks of the desired mode. The temperature-dependence property of the FM FBGs has been utilized to tune the reflection spectra. Through temperature control, 20 W level output power was obtained when the output laser was switched between the  mode and the  mode in both an all-fiberized ytterbium-doped laser and a Raman laser, which is increased by \u223c2 orders of magnitude compared with previous demonstrations (almost less than 100 mW).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A feasible co-endcapping strategy has been developed for the synthesis of monofunctional polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) modified waterborne polyurethane (WPU). The work starts from the synthesis of di-isocyanate terminated PU prepolymer from isophorone di-isocyanate (IPDI), poly (1,4-butylene adipate) end-capped diol (PBAD), and 2,2- bis (hydroxymethyl) butyric acid (DMBA). The two kinds of modifiers of monofunctional aminopropyl isobutyl POSS (AIPOSS) and with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) were used together to block the PU chains. The hybrid dispersions of curable silane-co-modified WPU with 2\u20138\u00a0wt% of AIRPOSS could form continuous and homogenous films under ambient conditions. The morphology and structure of the dispersed particles and the films were characterized, as well as the mechanical property and surface performance. The results indicate that the incorporation of POSS moieties into the silane-modified PU can significantly improve the mechanical property of the films and the formation of additional physical crosslinking points upon the chemical crosslinking networks. Moreover, both the surface hydrophobicity and the dielectric performance have been promoted by the incorporation of POSS. Furthermore, fluorinated groups were introduced on the films by the treatment of the fluorosilane coupling agent. The fluoro-POSS-PU hybrid films exhibit notable surface hydrophobicity as well as low dielectric constant and loss.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The design and fabrication of polymer microspheres with structural complexity in Pickering emulsion systems is a pioneering topic in recent years. Herein we report a synthesis of structured and molecularly imprinted multicore rattle-type microspheres through a facile method based on the Pickering emulsion polymerization using silica nanoparticles as the only stabilizer. The void inside the sphere was induced by the polymerization-driven phase separation approach tailoring by the interface interaction. However, the imprinting template of bisphenol A (BPA) is found to serve also as the heterogeneous nuclei, whose superimposition on the polymerization induced phase separation creates the opportunities for the formation of the multicores encapsulated in the shell. A simple adjustment on the composition of the oil phase enabled the evolution of sphere internal structures from single void to multicores. Specifically, the reversibly incorporated BPA on the polymer spheres can be removed by extraction with the molecular information left and immobilized by crosslinking as the imprinted sites. The imprinted spheres can be used to selectively rebind BPA, which was comprehensively evaluated by a batch of rebinding experiments. The rattle-like microspheres recognized BPA molecules from their analogues and effectively removed them from the matrix with accelerated adsorption kinetics, which shows potential applications in the environmental or analytic fields where the removal or separation of BPA as an endocrine-disrupting chemical is in high demand.",

By using blending method, PPSQ nanoparticle latexes were dispersed in DWPU. By using in-situ method, as the precursor of PPSQ, phenyltrimethoxysilane was mixed in DWPU, and PPSQ was expected to be generated via in-situ sol-gel reaction during film formation. We systematically investigated the influences of PPSQ and its incorporation method on the phase separation of films. The competition between a heterophase-triggered phase separation and a silane-based crosslinking was found during film formation. The intrinsically local ordering permutation of PU segments was interrupted more or less with PPSQ. Both surface composition and morphology were altered in correspondence to the different addition amount of PPSQ.

We here demonstrate a facile miniemulsion based polymerization to synthesize single hole hollow MIP particles for the recognition of bisphenol A (BPA). Uniform submicron products can be achieved through one-step polymerization in the aqueous dispersion, where the polymer seed has been swelled in the miniemulsion of the cross-linker and functional monomers together with the template molecules of BPA. After the removal of the seed and the template molecules by extraction, the electron microscopy characterization reveals bowl-like particles with a single hole on the concave surface. The unique single hole hollow structure is determined by the polymerization induced phase separation in the miniemulsion droplets and can be altered by monomer components. The characteristic of MIP is illustrated by the molecular recognition in the rebinding tests, where the particles prepared under the optimal formulation exhibit remarkable kinetics and desirable selectivity towards BPA in the mixed solution of methanol and water (20:80, v/v). The MIP particles with single hole hollow structure would be attractive in environmental and analytic fields for BPA decontamination.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The building of polymer composite particles in their confined colloidal-scale space is a highlighted topic, leading to advanced structure complexity and high performance in functional coating applications. Here, we demonstrate a direct emulsion polymerization (EP) approach to synthesize composite latex with hindered phenol (HP), a kind of functional small molecules, successfully loaded inside colloidal polymer particles. Monomer conversion as well as the evolution of droplet/particle size has been traced as a function of polymerization time. The results evidence the smooth running of the polymerization process with high HP loading in situ in the aqueous dispersion which could reach 30 phr. As-synthesized HP/polymer latex could be conveniently used for the formation of coating films. The films are unique for the greatly improved damping properties. With HP content of 30 phr, the effective damping temperature range can be broadened to 112 \u2103, and the a maximum loss factor can rise to 2.7. The weak hydrogen bonding is found to be the key for the incorporation of HP with the polymer segments, and contributes to the dissipation of vibration energy in the films. Combined with the environmental benefits, waterborne composite latex here is of potential application for the building of green damping coating systems.",

We here study the in situ molecular imprinting in the Stober synthesis of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) microspheres, and two different approaches are demonstrated. One approach is named as organic molecular imprinting, during which the target molecules of bisphenol A (BPA) are incorporated as the template in the gelation of RF resin. The other is named as inorganic molecular imprinting, during which the template is introduced together with inorganic precursor of titanate. The sizes of the produced spheric particles are found to rely on the ratio of ethanol/water in the reaction medium. Recognition sites which are BPA specific have been detected on both the RF and RF-carbon/TiO 2  spheres, and the latter show slightly higher capacity and selectivity in rebinding tests. Importantly, the integration of the photo active nano TiO 2  on the submicron spheric carbon support with BPA imprinted sites is of unique advantages, which exhibits as the specific high photocatalytic efficiency on BPA degradation under UV light. This, together with the high selectivity, substantial efficiency and operable uniform size of the composite spheres would be useful in the engineering for environmental and analysis fields.",

        "abstract": "Human group activity recognition has drawn the attention of researchers worldwide because of the significant role it plays in many applications, including video surveillance and public security. Existing solutions for group activity recognition rely on human detection and tracking. To ensure high detection accuracy, current state-of-the-art tracking techniques require human supervision to identify objects of interest before automatic tracking can take place. This limitation has prevented existing approaches from being used in real-world applications. In scenarios when human supervision is unavailable, tracking algorithms could generate inaccurate trajectories and cause a decrease in performance for the existing group analysis methods. To address the aforementioned drawbacks, we investigate in this paper an end-to-end deep model, Differential Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (DRCNN). Our model consists of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and stacked differential long short-term memory (DLSTM) networks. It takes sequential raw video data as input and does not consider each group member as an individual object. Different from traditional non-end-to-end solutions which separate the steps of feature extraction and parameter learning, DRCNN utilizes a unified deep model to optimize the parameters of CNN and LSTM hand in hand. It thus has the potential of generating a more harmonious model. In addition, taking advantage of the semantic representation of CNN and the memory states of DLSTM, DRCNN has strong capabilities in understanding complex scene semantics and group dynamics. Extensive experimental studies indicate that the proposed technique can accomplish the task of fully automatic group activity recognition without sacrificing performance, and even outperforms the human-aided state-ofthe- art methods on two benchmark group activity datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end group activity recognition technique ever proposed.",

        "abstract": "Although Query-by-Example techniques based on Euclidean distance in a multidimensional feature space have proved to be effective for image databases, this approach cannot be effectively applied to video since the number of dimensions would be massive due to the richness and complexity of video data. The above issue has been addressed in two recent solutions, namely Deterministic Quantization (DQ) and Dynamic Temporal Quantization (DTQ). DQ divides the video into equal segments and extracts a visual feature vector for each segment. The bag-of-word feature is then encoded by hashing to facilitate approximate nearest neighbor search using Hamming distance. One weakness of this approach is the deterministic segmentation of video data. DTQ improves on this by using dynamic video segmentation to obtain varied-length video segments. As a result, feature vectors extracted from these video segments can better capture the semantic content of the video. To support very large video databases, it is desirable to minimize the number of segments in order to keep the size of the feature representation as small as possible. We achieve this by using only one video segment (i.e., no video data segmentation is even necessary) with even better retrieval performance. Our scheme models video using differential long short-term memory (DLSTM) recurrent neural networks and obtains a highly compact fixed-size feature representation with the output of hidden states of the DLSTM. Each of these features are further compressed by hashing them into binary bits via quantization. Experimental results based on two public data sets, UCF101 and MSRActionPairs, indicate that the proposed video modeling technique outperforms DTQ by a significant margin.",

Taking advantage of the semantic representation of CNN and the memory states of LSTM, ConvDLSTM can effectively analyze both the crowd scene and motion information. Existing LSTM-based crowd scene solutions explore  temporal information and are claimed to be deep in time.

        "abstract": "With the popularity of mobile sensor technology, smart wearable devices open a unprecedented opportunity to solve the challenging human activity recognition (HAR) problem by learning expressive representations from the multi-dimensional daily sensor signals. This inspires us to develop a new algorithm applicable to both camera-based and wearable sensor-based HAR systems. Although competitive classification accuracy has been reported, existing methods often face the challenge of distinguishing visually similar activities composed of activity patterns in different temporal orders. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic algorithm to compactly encode temporal orders of activity patterns for HAR. Specifically, the algorithm learns an optimal set of latent patterns such that their temporal structures really matter in recognizing different human activities. Then, a novel probabilistic First-Take-All (pFTA) approach is introduced to generate compact features from the orders of these latent patterns to encode the entire sequence, and the temporal structural similarity between different sequences can be efficiently measured by the Hamming distance between compact features. Experiments on three public HAR datasets show the proposed pFTA approach can achieve competitive performance in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency.",

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep architecture, convolutional nonlinear differential recurrent neural networks (CNDRNNs), for crowd scene understanding. CNDRNNs consist of GoogleNet Inception V3 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and nonlinear differential recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Different from traditional non-end-to-end solutions which separate the steps of feature extraction and parameter learning, CNDRNN utilizes a unified deep model to optimize the parameters of CNN and RNN hand in hand. It thus has the potential of generating a more harmonious model. The proposed architecture takes sequential raw image data as input, and does not rely on tracklet or trajectory detection. It thus has clear advantages o...",

        "abstract": "With the prevalence of the commodity depth sensors (e.g. Kinect), multimodal data including RGB stream, depth stream and audio stream have been utilized in various applications such as video games, education and health. Nevertheless, it is still very challenging to effectively fuse the features from multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a WTA (Winner-Take-All) Hash-based feature fusion algorithm and investigate its application in 3D human action recognition. Specifically, the WTA Hashing is performed to encode features from different modalities into the ordinal space. By leveraging the ordinal measures rather than using the absolute value of the original features, such feature embedding can provide a form of resilience to the scale and numerical perturbations. We propose a frame-level feature fusion algorithm and develop a WTA Hash-embedded warping algorithm to measure the similarity between two sequences. Experiments performed on three public 3D human action datasets show that the proposed fusion algorithm has achieved state-of-the-art recognition results even with the nearest neighbor search.",

        "abstract": "From wearable devices to depth cameras, researchers have exploited various multimodal data to recognize human actions for applications, such as video gaming, education, and healthcare. Although there many successful techniques have been presented in the literature, most current approaches have focused on statistical or local spatiotemporal features and do not explicitly explore the temporal dynamics of the sensor data. However, human action data contain rich temporal structure information that can characterize the unique underlying patterns of different action categories. From this perspective, we propose a novel temporal order modeling approach to human action recognition. Specifically, we explore subspace projections to extract the latent temporal patterns from different human action sequences. The temporal order between these patterns are compared, and the index of the pattern that appears first is used to encode the entire sequence. This process is repeated multiple times and produces a compact feature vector representing the temporal dynamics of the sequence. Human action recognition can then be efficiently solved by the nearest neighbor search based on the Hamming distance between these compact feature vectors. We further introduce a sequential optimization algorithm to learn the optimized projections that preserve the pairwise label similarity of the action sequences. Experimental results on two public human action datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique in both accuracy and efficiency.",

Future IoT applications will also require real-time data retrieval as information travels through and is processed by web servers. For these reasons, we envision a demand for real-time web applications which require a high cost to service providers in case of service interruption. A time-critical real-time application is assumed to have the capability to handle failures in infrastructure, not with a service interruption, but with minor performance degradation. In this study, a fully-redundant system architecture for web server deployment, including the network and server, with fast failover capabilities is presented. Unlike interruptions that require applications to be re-initialized, this proposed system provides fail-over speeds for every component, such that, even the fast real-time applications can continue to operate. Experiments with application scenarios prove superior failover speeds under several test cases and reveal limitations in the latest technologies in supporting the aforementioned applications.",

Recent studies have suggested that baicalein (BA) might be a potent MDR reversal agent with the ability of P-glycoprotein inhibition and oxidative stress augmentation. Herein, we co-encapsulated PTX and BA in nanoemulsions (PTX/BA NE) for overcoming MDR in breast cancer. Paclitaxel-cholesterol complex and baicalein-phospholipid complex were prepared to improve the liposolubility of PTX and BA. The cytotoxicity of the combination of PTX and BA with different weight ratios were evaluated and the combination with a weight ratio of 1/1 exhibited the strongest synergistic effect. In vitro cytotoxicity study indicated that PTX/BA NE had a better antitumor efficacy in MCF-7/Tax cells than other PTX formulations. Studies on cellular uptake demonstrated that the PTX/BA NE could effectively accumulate in cancer cells. Mechanism research showed that PTX/BA NE could significantly increase the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), decrease cellular glutathione (GSH), and enhance caspase-3 activity in MCF-7/Tax cells. More importantly, in vivo antitumor study demonstrated that PTX/BA NE exhibited a much higher antitumor efficacy than other PTX formulations. These findings suggest that co-delivery of PTX and BA in nanoemulsions might provide us a potential combined therapeutic strategy for overcoming MDR.",

        "abstract": "Co-delivery of chemotherapy drugs and VEGF siRNA (siVEGF) to control tumor growth has been a research hotspot for improving cancer treatment. Current systems co-deliver siVEGF and chemo drugs into tumor cells simultaneously. Although effective, these systems do not flow to the abnormal blood vessels around tumor cells (vascular niche, PVN), which play an important role in the metastasis and deterioration of the tumor. Thus, we custom-synthesized triblock copolymer poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)-polyethyleneglycol-poly(L-histidine) (PCL-PEG-PHIS) with previously synthesized folate-PEG-PHIS to construct a targeted multifunctional polymer micelle (PTX/siVEGF-CPPs/TMPM) to sequentially deliver siVEGF-CPPs (disulfide bond-linked siVEGF and cell-penetrating peptides) and paclitaxel (PTX). The sequential delivery vesicles showed the anticipated three-layered TEM structure and dual-convertible (surface charge- and particle size-reversible) features in the tumor environment (pH\u202f6.5), which guaranteed the sequential release of siVEGF-CPPs and PTX in the tumor extracellular environment and tumor cells, respectively. To mimic the in vivo tumor environment, a double cell model was employed by co-culturing HUVECs and MCF-7 cells. Improved cell endocytosis efficiency, VEGF gene silence efficacy, and in vitro anti-proliferation activity were achieved. An in vivo study on MCF-7 tumor-bearing female nude mice also indicated that sequential delivery vesicles could lead to significant induction of tumor cell apoptosis, loss of VEGF expression, and destruction of tumor blood vessels (PVN and neovascularization). These sequential delivery vesicles show potential as an effective co-delivery platform for siVEGF and chemo drugs to improve cancer therapy efficacy.",

        "abstract": " Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are critical in tumor progression and metastasis. Selective targeting of TAMs holds great potential to ameliorate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhance the efficacy of antitumor therapy. Various liposomes have been developed to target TAMs via cell-specific surface receptors either to deplete or re-educate TAMs. Since immuno-stimulation often initiates with the interaction of nanocarriers with the innate immunity cells such as macrophages, the intrinsic impact of drug-free liposomes on macrophage activation and polarization via cell interaction is one of the most critical issues in nanomedicine for promoting effective immunotherapy.  In this study, conventional bare liposomes, PEGylated liposomes, and mannosylated liposomes were developed and the cytotoxicity, cellular internalization, immunostimulatory activity, targeting efficiency, antitumor efficacy, and mechanism were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  All liposomes displayed an ideal particle size, good biocompatibility, and controlled release behavior. Mannosylated liposomes exhibited superior in vitro cellular internalization and tumor spheroid penetration with the aid of the mannose receptor-mediated TAMs-targeting effects. In particular, mannosylated liposomes promoted the polarization of both M0 and M2 to the M1 phenotype by enhancing the expression ratio of CD86/CD206 in vitro. Of note, mannosylated liposomes could inhibit G422 glioma tumor growth, which may be attributed to the polarization of TAMs, as evidenced by the reduction in expression level of the TAMs surface marker.  These results indicate the potential value of mannosylated liposomes in the design of a rational delivery system to enhance the antitumor immune efficacy of immunomodulators by inducing a shift from the M2 to the M1 phenotype.",

        "abstract": "Phospholipid complex is one of the most successful approaches for enhancing oral bioavailability of poorly absorbed plant constituents. But the sticky property of phospholipids results in an unsatisfactory dissolution of drugs. In this study, a matrix dispersion of baicalein based on phospholipid complex (BaPC-MD) was first prepared by a discontinuous solvent evaporation method, in which polyvinylpyrrolidone-K30 (PVP-K30) was employed for improving the dispersibility of baicalein phospholipid complex (BaPC) and increasing dissolution of baicalein. The combination ratio of baicalein and phospholipids in BaPC-MD was 99.39% and baicalein was still in a complete complex state with phospholipid in BaPC-MD. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analyzes demonstrated that baicalein was fully transformed to an amorphous state in BaPC-MD and phospholipid complex formed. The water-solubility and n-octanol solubility of baicalein in BaPC-MD significantly increased compared with those of pure baicalein. Compared with baicalein and BaPC, the cumulative dissolution of BaPC-MD at 120\u2009min increased 2.77- and 1.23-fold, respectively. In vitro permeability study in Caco-2 cells indicated that the permeability of BaPC-MD was remarkably higher than those of baicalein and BaPC. Pharmacokinetic study showed that the average C of BaPC-MD was significantly increased compared to baicalein and BaPC. AUC of BaPC-MD was 5.01- and 1.91-fold of baicalein and BaPC, respectively. The novel BaPC-MD significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of baicalein by improving the dissolution and permeability of baicalein without destroying the complexation state of baicalein and phospholipids. The current drug delivery system provided an optimal strategy to significantly enhance oral bioavailability for poorly water-soluble drugs.",

        "abstract": "With the penetration of distributed generators (DGs), operation planning studies are essential in maintaining and operating a reliable and secure power system. Appropriate siting and sizing of DGs could lead to many positive effects forthe distribution system concerned, such as the reduced total costs associated with DGs, reduced network losses, and improved voltage profiles and enhanced power-supply reliability. In this paper, expected load interruption cost is used as the assessment of operation risk in distribution systems, which is assessed by the point estimate method (PEM). In light with the costs of system operation planning, a novel mathematical model of chance constrained programming (CCP) framework for optimal siting and sizing of DGs in distribution systems is proposed considering the uncertainties of DGs. And then, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), which combines the GA with traditional optimization methods, is employed to solve the proposed CCP model. Finally,the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed CCP model are verified by the modified IEEE 30-bus system, and the test results have demonstrated that this proposed CCP model is more reasonable to determine the siting and sizing of DGs compared with traditional CCP model.",

        "abstract": "Wind power has achieved great development in Northern China, but abundant wind power is dissipated, rather than utilized, due to inflexible electricity production of combined heat and power (CHP) units. In this paper, an integrated CHP system consisting of CHP units, wind power plants, and condensing power plants is investigated to decouple the power and heat production on both the power supply side and heat supply side, by incorporating electrical energy storage (EES) and thermal energy storage (TES). Then the integrated CHP system dispatch (ICHPSD) model is formulated to reach the target of reducing wind power curtailment and primary energy consumption. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ICHPSD model are verified by the six-bus system, and the simulation results show that EES has a better effect on wind power integration than TES. The annual net benefits by incorporating EES and TES increase with increasing wind penetration, but they gradually approach saturation. Introducing both EES and TES can largely increase the amount of wind power integration and improve the operation efficiency of the system.",

        "abstract": "In the traditional paradigm, large power plants provide active and reactive power required for the transmission system and the distribution network purchases grid power from it. However, with more and more distributed energy resources (DERs) connected at distribution levels, it is necessary to schedule DERs to meet their demand and participate in the electricity markets at the distribution level in the near future. This paper proposes a comprehensive operational scheduling model to be used in the distribution management system (DMS). The model aims to determine optimal decisions on active elements of the network, distributed generations (DGs), and responsive loads (RLs), seeking to minimize the day-ahead composite economic cost of the distribution network. For more detailed simulation, the composite cost includes the aspects of the operation cost, emission cost, and transmission loss cost of the network. Additionally, the DMS effectively utilizes the reactive power support capabilities of wind and solar power integrated in the distribution, which is usually neglected in previous works. The optimization procedure is formulated as a nonlinear combinatorial problem and solved with a modified differential evolution algorithm. A modified 33-bus distribution network is employed to validate the satisfactory performance of the proposed methodology.",

        "abstract": "A large amount of wind power has to be curtailed due to the inflexibility of the combined heat and power (CHP) system in the heating season in northern China. The power-to-gas (P2G) technology, which uses electricity to produce hydrogen or synthetic natural gas, has become a promising energy conversion option for the utilization of surplus power energy. In this paper, an integrated natural gas, heat, and power dispatch (INGHPD) model which balances natural gas, heat, and power demand considering wind power and a P2G unit, is proposed. A natural gas network and P2G are modeled and integrated into the dispatch model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, an integrated energy system consisting of a six-bus power system, a six-node natural gas system, and a district heating system is simulated. The benefits of P2G are investigated in terms of reducing wind power curtailment, as well as system operation cost and CO 2 emissions. The results in the deterministic model show that with the introduction of 40 MW P2G, the wind power curtailment rate decreases from 24.0% to 9.7%. The daily wind power energy consumed by P2G reaches 256 MWh and the daily CO 2 emissions reduction reaches 46,080 kg. Additionally, the impact of the power and heat demand on the gas production of P2G and of the P2G capacity on the wind power curtailment are also investigated. P2G tends to generate more natural gas when the power demand is low and the heat demand is high.",

        "abstract": "This paper studied the effect of alcohols on simultaneous esterification and alkylation reactions designed for the upgrading of bio-oil, and the separation of upgraded oil. The upgrading of bio-oil was performed in an autoclave with Amberlyst-36 as the catalyst, and methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol as the alcoholic solvents. The separation of various chemical components, such as unreacted solvents, water phase, extraction phase, and high value-added chemicals, in the upgraded oil were realized via distillation, at 80\u201390\u2009\u00b0C (at 0.01\u00a0MPa) vacuum distillation and an extraction process. The results showed that, the simultaneous esterification and alkylation reactions for the upgrading of bio-oil not only restrained the acetylation reaction of aldehydes, which increased the relative contents of stable ethers, but also enhanced the oil soluble components of the upgraded bio-oil. After separation, the high value-added chemical, namely methyl-\u03b1-d-glucopyranoside, was obtained with 5.39\u00a0wt.% yield and a relative content of 88.9% (sugar phase). The results from this work also showed that this novel method was quite a promising technique for upgrading bio-oil together with the separation of the high value-added chemical.",

The goal of the study was to develop a directional liquefaction process using dielectric heating with microwave energy. The methanolysis of biomass into methyl levulinate was studied in the presence of several acid catalysts. The C6 sugar substrates in biomass were successfully converted into methyl levulinate under the optimized conditions (180\u00a0\u00b0C, 40 min) with a yield of 29.39 wt%. 5-Hydroxymethyl furfural, glucose, fructose, cellobiose, corn starch, and microcrystalline cellulose were selected as models for directional microwave-assisted liquefaction. Therefore, the possible reaction pathway of biomass to methyl levulinate could be investigated. The selective catalytic conversion of biomass was found to be highly efficient for the generation of MLA (reaching a maximum yield of approximately 30 wt%), higher than the levulinic acid yield (14 wt%) in aqueous solution under the same reaction conditions. The results suggested that directional microwave-assisted liquefaction is an effective method that can produce a high value-added fuel additive (methyl levulinate) from lignocellulosic biomass under designated reaction processes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The activated carbon supported Mo 2 C and W 2 C were synthesized successfully for hydrotreatment of fatty acids to produce diesel-like hydrocarbons. The carburization temperature, carburization gas as well as metal loading amount were studied. High carburization temperature was feasible for W 2 C/AC, but not for Mo 2 C/AC because it resulted in agglomeration of molybdenum compound and destruction of catalyst. Under hydrotreatment condition (360\u202f\u00b0C, H 2  3.0\u202fMPa, 3.0\u202fh) the conversion achieved 96.01% over Mo 2 C/AC prepared at 700\u202f\u00b0C and 54.88% over W 2 C/AC prepared at 900\u202f\u00b0C respectively. During carburization both flowing nitrogen and hydrogen were proper for formation of W 2 C/AC, while only flowing hydrogen was appropriate for Mo 2 C/AC. The hydrotreatment parameters (reaction temperature and reaction time) were also investigated. The high reaction temperature and long reaction time facilitated the conversion of fatty acids, meanwhile the high reaction temperature simultaneously improved the cracking degree of products.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The in situ polymerization of aniline as a nitrogen source was adopted to prepare nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (NMC), which further supported the molybdenum carbide catalyst for the hydrotreatment of fatty acids. The nitrogen doping drastically enhanced the catalytic performance of Mo 2 C/N 1.0 MC-700 with 92.7% conversion and 86.7% selectivity, which are much higher than the values of Mo 2 C/MC (84.8% and 70.1%, respectively). The kinetic study revealed that the apparent activation energy was reduced greatly after nitrogen doping. In addition, the nitrogen-doped catalyst showed decent stability, and the conversion and selectivity over Mo 2 C/N 1.0 MC-700 decreased by 4.4% and 6.9% respectively, after recycling three times. The deactivation mainly resulted from the coke deposition on the surface of catalyst. The high catalytic activity and stability were ascribed to the formation of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N in NMC, which resulted in the high dispersion of Mo, a decrease in the particle size as well as strong interactions between support and active sites. The hydrotreatment conditions of oleic acid were studied, and the optimal reaction conditions were as follows: reaction temperature, 350\u2009\u00b0C; initial H 2  pressure, 3.0\u2009MPa; n-hexane as solvent. Moreover, the results indicated that a substrate with a saturated carbon double bond and ester group was more easily converted into hydrocarbons.",

Phenol was first introduced to the in situ hydrogenolysis system to form a complex solvent to improve the lignin depolymerization over heterogeneous catalysts. The promotion effect of phenol was obviously observed during the hydrogenolysis process, leading to improved bio-oil yield and decreased solid residue yield, due to the unique dissolution and diffusion properties of phenol-containing solvent. The synergistic effects of basic sites and complex solvents were observed; thus, herein, the effect of catalysts, reaction temperature, and time on the hydrogenolysis, repolymerization, and coking on catalysts was investigated in detail, considering the molecular weight, elemental composition, and higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil. The highest bio-oil yield was up t...",

Then we monitored the diabetic metabolic parameters, kidney function, oxidative stress and AKT signaling pathway in db/db mice. Administration of silibinin to db/db mice improved diabetic condition, as evidenced by the decrease of body weight, HbAc1level and serum insulin level in db/db mice. Silibinin prevented kidney injury and attenuated oxidative stress in db/db mice. Silibinin activated AKT signaling pathway and decreased the levels of p-GSK-3\u03b2, Bax and cleaved caspase-3.

        "abstract": "Achaete scute-like 2 (Ascl2) is the Wnt signaling target, its regulation by other signaling is undefined. Now we demonstrated that CD133/CD44 cell population from HT-29 or Caco-2 cells exhibited cancer stem cell (CSC) properties with highly expressed Ascl2, which is related to the Hippo signaling pathway. YAP1 interference in CD133/CD44 HT-29 or Caco-2 cells reduced their proliferation, colony-forming ability and tumorsphere formation  and inhibited the 'stemness'-associated genes and Ascl2 expression. Enforcing YAP1 expression in HT-29 or Caco-2 cells triggered the opposite changes. Ascl2 interference reversed the phenotype of YAP1-enforced expressed HT-29 or Caco-2 cells. Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) protein, not KLF5 mRNA levels, were increased due to YAP1 overexpression which is reported to prevent KLF5 degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays demonstrated that YAP1 bound with KLF5 in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that both YAP1 and KLF5 bound to the first two loci with GC-boxes in Ascl2 promoter and induced Ascl2 transcription. The decreased Ascl2 transcription by YAP1 interference required an intact KLF5 binding site (GC-box) within Ascl2 promoter, KLF5 knockdown reduced YAP1 binding and Ascl2 luciferase reporter activity upon YAP1 overexpression. Positive correlation among YAP1 and Ascl2 mRNA levels was observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples. Thus, our study demonstrated that Ascl2, a fate decider of CRC progenitor cells can be activated by the Hippo signaling pathway in CRC progenitor cells, and ensured their self-renewability.",

        "abstract": "The Wnt signaling pathway controls stem cell identity in the intestinal epithelium and cancer stem cells (CSCs). The transcription factor Ascl2 (Wnt target gene) is fate decider of intestinal cryptic stem cells and colon cancer stem cells. It is unclear how Wnt signaling is translated into Ascl2 expression and keeping the self-renewal of CRC progenitor cells. We showed that the exogenous Ascl2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells activated the endogenous Ascl2 expression via a direct autoactivatory loop, including Ascl2 binding to its own promoter and further transcriptional activation. Higher Ascl2 expression in human CRC cancerous tissues led to greater enrichment in Ascl2 immunoprecipitated DNA within the Ascl2 promoter in the CRC cancerous sample than the peri-cancerous mucosa. Ascl2 binding to its own promoter and inducing further transcriptional activation of the Ascl2 gene was predominant in the CD133CD44 CRC population. R-spondin1/Wnt activated Ascl2 expression dose-dependently in the CD133CD44 CRC population, but not in the CD133CD44 CRC population, which was caused by differences in Ascl2 autoregulation under R-spondin1/Wnt activation. R-spondin1/Wnt treatment in the CD133CD44 or CRC CD133CD44 populations exerted a different pattern of stemness maintenance, which was defined by alterations of the mRNA levels of stemness-associated genes, the protein expression levels (Bmi1, C-myc, Oct-4 and Nanog) and tumorsphere formation. The results indicated that Ascl2 autoregulation formed a transcriptional switch that was enhanced by Wnt signaling in the CD133CD44 CRC population, thus conferring their self-renewal.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nanog is an important embryonic stem cell (ESC) gene that does not function as a classical oncogene, but needs to cooperate with other molecules to potentiate tumorigenic activity. The question addressed by the present study was whether a miRNA link exists between Nanog and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition (MET) plasticity. Here, we found that Nanog mRNA expression level was inversely correlated with miR-200c and miR-200b expression levels in colon cancer cell lines and human colorectal cancer tissues. Forced Nanog expression in low-Nanog colon cancer cells inhibited miR-200c and miR-200b expression, and interfered Nanog expression in high-Nanog colon cancer cells promoted miR-200c and miR-200b expression. Furthermore, we confirmed that Nanog directly repressed transcription of the miR-200c and miR-200b genes, and miR-200c and miR-200b mediated Nanog-induced EMT occurrence. Luciferase and ChIP assays determined that Nanog bound directly to the potential Nanog binding sites in the miR-200c and miR-200b promoters and repressed their transcription. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Nanog modulates EMT\u2013MET plasticity by regulating miR-200 clusters via a direct transcriptional mechanism, and the Nanog-miR-200 axis may be a good therapeutic target for CRC control.",

However, little is known about the regulation of the Ascl2/miR-200 axis. Here, we found that hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) mRNA levels were positively correlated with Ascl2 mRNA levels and inversely correlated with miR-200b in CRC samples. Mechanistically, we showed that Ascl2 was a downstream target of HIF-1\u03b1 and had a critical role in the EMT phenotype induced by hypoxia or HIF-1\u03b1 over-expression. Hypoxia or HIF-1\u03b1 over-expression activated Ascl2 expression in CRC cells in a direct transcriptional mechanism via binding with the hypoxia-response element (HRE) at the proximal Ascl2 promoter. HIF-1\u03b1-induced Ascl2 expression repressed miR-200b expression to induce EMT occurrence. Furthermore, we found HIF-1\u03b1 was a direct target of miR-200b. MiR-200b bound with the 3\u2032-UTR of HIF-1\u03b1 in CRC cells. HIF-1\u03b1/Ascl2/miR-200b regulatory feedback circuit modulated the EMT-MET plasticity of CRC cells. Our results confirmed a novel HIF-1\u03b1/Ascl2/miR-200b regulatory feedback circuit in modulating EMT-MET plasticity of CRC cells, which could serve as a possible therapeutic target.",

The deviation of workpiece axis from its optimal machining axis has a significant influence on machining accuracy of angle, eccentric throw, and diameter and contour of the heavy crankshaft in non-circular grinding. To reduce the consumption of manual labor and setting-up time, an automatic alignment approach and apparatus is proposed and integrated into the non-circular grinder. The on-machine gauge senses X and Y components of deviation of crank journal axis and feed them back to the computerized numerical control system. The motor-driving steady rests based on slider-crank mechanism are controlled to compensate for the deviation. The algorithm with self-correcting ability for compensation value is employed to make up for the finite contact stiffness of workpiece and steady rest. The results of three alignment tests are compared, which demonstrates the better effect on alignment precision and efficiency of the self-correcting compensation.",

        "abstract": "Importance sampling (IS) as an elegant and efficient variance reduction (VR) technique for the acceleration of stochastic optimization problems has attracted many researches recently. Unlike commonly adopted stochastic uniform sampling in stochastic optimizations, IS-integrated algorithms sample training data at each iteration with respect to a weighted sampling probability distribution $P$, which is constructed according to the precomputed importance factors. Previous experimental results show that IS has achieved remarkable progresses in the acceleration of training convergence. Unfortunately, the calculation of the sampling probability distribution $P$ causes a major limitation of IS: it requires the input data to be well-structured, i.e., the feature vector is properly defined. Consequently, recurrent neural networks (RNN) as a popular learning algorithm is not able to enjoy the benefits of IS due to the fact that its raw input data, i.e., the training sequences, are often unstructured which makes calculation of $P$ impossible. In considering of the the popularity of RNN-based learning applications and their relative long training time, we are interested in accelerating them through IS. This paper propose a novel Fast-Importance-Mining algorithm to calculate the importance factor for unstructured data which makes the application of IS in RNN-based applications possible. Our experimental evaluation on popular open-source RNN-based learning applications validate the effectiveness of IS in improving the convergence rate of RNNs.",

        "abstract": "Variance reduction (VR) techniques for convergence rate acceleration of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm have been developed with great efforts recently. VRu0027s two variants, stochastic variance-reduced-gradient (SVRG-SGD) and importance sampling (IS-SGD) have achieved remarkable progresses. Meanwhile, asynchronous SGD (ASGD) is becoming more critical due to the ever-increasing scale of the optimization problems. The application of VR in ASGD to accelerate its convergence rate has therefore attracted much interest and SVRG-ASGDs were proposed. However, we found that SVRG suffers dissatisfying performance in accelerating ASGD when datasets are sparse and large-scale. In such case, SVRG-ASGDu0027s iterative computation cost is magnitudes higher than plain ASGD which makes it very inefficient. On the other hand, IS achieves improved convergence rate with few extra computation cost and is invariant to the sparsity of datasets. These advantages make it very suitable for the acceleration of ASGD on large-scale sparse datasets. In this paper we propose a novel IS-combined ASGD for efficient convergence rate acceleration, namely, IS-ASGD. We theoretically prove the superior convergence bound of IS-ASGD. Experimental results also demonstrate our statements.",

        "abstract": "The vertical deformation monitoring of a suspension bridge tower is of paramount importance to maintain the operational safety since nearly all forces are eventually transferred as the vertical stress on the tower. This paper analyses the components affecting the vertical deformation and attempts to reveal its deformation mechanism. Firstly, we designed a strategy for high-precision GNSS data processing aiming at facilitating deformation extraction and analysis. Then, 33 months of vertical deformation time series of the southern tower of the Forth Road Bridge (FRB) in the UK were processed, and the accurate subsidence and the parameters of seasonal signals were estimated based on a classic function model that has been widely studied to analyse GNSS coordinate time series. We found that the subsidence rate is about 4.7 mm/year, with 0.1 mm uncertainty. Meanwhile, a 15-month meteorological dataset was utilised with a thermal expansion model (TEM) to explain the effects of seasonal signals on tower deformation. The amplitude of the annual signals correlated quite well that obtained by the TEM, with the consistency reaching 98.9%, demonstrating that the thermal effect contributes significantly to the annual signals. The amplitude of daily signals displays poor consistency with the ambient temperature data. However, the phase variation tendencies between the daily signals of the vertical deformation and the ambient temperature are highly consistent after February 2016. Finally, the potential contribution of the North Atlantic Drift (NAD) to the characteristics of annual and daily signals is discussed because of the special geographical location of the FRB. Meanwhile, this paper emphasizes the importance of collecting more detailed meteorological and other loading data for the investigation of the vertical deformation mechanism of the bridge towers over time with the support of GNSS.",
