        "abstract": "To analyze the value of ultrasonography (standardized A/B scan) and CT scan in the diagnosis of orbital vascular tumors and vascular malformations.One hundred and eight cases of orbital vascular tumors and malformations were studied, including 98 cases examined by ultrasonography, 108 cases examined by CT scan and 94 cases studied by orbital operation and pathological examination. There were 54 cases of cavernous hemangioma, 26 cases of varix, 13 cases of venous hemangioma, 6 cases of lymphangioma, 5 cases of infantile hemangioma and 4 cases of others disorders.The tumor could be detected in ultrasonography in 96/98 cases (98%), the false negative rate of ultrasonography was 2% (2/98). The nature of the tumor could be determined by ultrasonography in 93% (91/98) cases pre-operatively. The tumor could be found by CT in all cases (108/108). The nature of the tumor could be determined by CT in 92% (99/108) cases pre-operatively.Combined ultrasonography with CT scan can estimate the nature, extent and location of orbital vascular tumors and malformations and can be useful for selection of the route of orbital operation.",

Twenty-two cases of severe orbital complications after endoscopic sinus surgery between January 2002 and December 2012 were included. The main parameters for analyzing were history of paranasal sinuses, clinical manifestation of complications, imaging findings, site of injury, the relationship between injury site and clinical signs.Twenty-two cases of patients with serious complications, including: visual loss in 7 cases (32%), ptosis in 5 cases (23%), ocular position deviation in 15 cases (68%), limitation of ocular motility in 17 cases (77%), enophthalmos in 10 cases (45%). Imaging display: medial rectus involvement in 14 cases, inferior rectus involvement in 6 cases. The most common site of entry into the orbit was the medial orbital wall (14 cases, 64%), followed by the inferomedial wall (6 cases, 27%). Radiological imagings showed the medial displacement of optic nerve in 7 cases (32%) and foreign bodies in the orbit or paranasal sinuses in 8 cases (36%). Medical treatment was given in 1 cases and surgical repair in 9 cases. Removal of foreign bodies was performed in 6 cases. One patient received inferior rectus and orbital wall repair, but no improvement in ocular movement. Orbital reconstruction for endophthalmos was performed in two cases. The improvement was recorded only in one case.The most severe complication is vision loss and the most common complication is limitation of ocular motility and ocular position deviation. The most common site of injury was within the rectus muscle, often accompanied by the defect of inner wall. Except foreign bodies, other complications were difficult to treat with poor prognosis. Emphasis should be placed on prevention.",

Of the 38 cases with orbital neurilemomas, location of tumors was superior of the orbit in 17 cases; lateral and inferior in 19 cases and medial in 2 cases. Shape of the tumors was elongate or round-like 26 cases, leaf-like and dumbbell 12 cases. CT scanning showed soft tissue high density mass in 32 cases, 6 cases were heterogeneity (for cystoid change). MR imaging in 33 patients displayed a identical T1 and a long T2 signal intensity weighted images in 4 cases; identical T1 and T2 mixed signal (short, identical and long signal) in 28 cases; identical T1 and T2 in 1 cases. After Gd-DTPA enhancement in 32 cases, heterogeneity enhancement of the mass was seen in 28 cases, marked enhancement 4 cases. Four cases in all cases was found orbital-cranial communicate mass. Surgical approach was lateral orbitotomy in 26 cases, combined lateral and medial orbitotomy in 2 cases, anterior orbitotomy 4 cases and medial orbitotomy in 2 cases. Conclusions: Modern medical imaging, especial MR imaging can demonstrate the site, configuration, and characteristics of the tumors and contribute to the diagnosis and treatment. Skill of surgery can improve the rate of success and decrease the complications.",

Clinical records were reviewed retrospectively of 17 orbital RB patients who had undergone exenteration from November 1999 to November 2010 at Armed Police General Hospital. The clinical records included ophthalmic history, process of diagnosis and treatment, symptom and signs, surgical approach, pathological diagnosis and follow-up results. The reasons of orbital exenteration for orbital RB patients according to medical history, process of diagnosis and treatment were analyzed.The average age of patient was 3.2 years old. The ratio of male versus female was 1.1: 1. The common clinical findings were as following: 11 cases of orbital mass, 7 cases of exophthalmos, 6 cases with palpebral edema, 4 cases of conjunctival congestion and edema with conjunctival mass, and 2 cases with orbital pain. Reasons for orbital exenteration were as following: 7 patients who lost the opportunity of the treatment because of concernning about the cost of treatment and poor prognosis and caused worst outcome. Exenteration had to be done eventually. Five cases of orbital recurrence happened after enucleation. Three patients' Rb invaded into orbit after conservative treatment intravenous chemotherapy or radio therapy alone. Two cases were misdiagnosed and mishandled causing rapidly tumor spread into the orbit.The major reasons of orbital exenteration for orbital RB patients lies in the following: giving up treatment from patients, tumor recurrence in the orbit after enucleation, progressing of orbital RB after simple conservative treatment, misdiagnosis and mishandling to let RB invade into orbit rapidly.",

The presence of heparanase-1, patched, smoothened and glioma-associated oncogene homologue-1 protein expression was determined in 23 cases of archival paraffin-embedded alveolar orbital rhabdomyosarcoma after immunohistochemistry. RNA was extracted from three groups of paraffin-embedded specimens and messenger RNA expressions of heparanase-1, smoothened and glioma-associated oncogene homologue-1 compared using nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and a limiting dilution analysis.The heparanase-1, patched, smoothened and glioma-associated oncogene homologue-1 protein was expressed in 91.3%, 87.0%, 91.3% and 78.3%, respectively, of the alveolar orbital rhabdomyosarcoma specimens. Untreated rhabdomyosarcoma samples tended to stain intensely, but staining was relatively weak in tissue obtained from the chemoradiotherapy group. The expression levels of heparanase-1, smoothened and glioma-associated oncogene homologue-1 messenger RNA in untreated and chemoradiotherapy groups paralleled that seen with immunology, and there were no significant differences in heparanase-1, smoothened and glioma-associated oncogene homologue-1 messenger RNA levels between the chemoradiotherapy group and the normal muscle group (P > 0.05). However, the messenger RNA in the untreated group were all significantly higher than those in the chemoradiotherapy and normal muscle groups (P < 0.01).Both heparanase-1 and hedgehog signalling pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of alveolar orbital rhabdomyosarcoma; however, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy appears to significantly inhibit their upregulation.",

Clinical outcomes were recorded including visual acuity, exophthalmometry, diplopia, clinical activity score (CAS) and CT scans before and 6 months after surgery. Intra- and postoperative complications were recorded.The postoperative visual acuity was improved in 17 eyes (56.7%, P < 0.05) of group CON. The mean proptosis reduction was (8.1 \u00b1 2.7) mm (t = 11.73, P < 0.01) and (11.4 \u00b1 3.1) mm (t = 15.52, P < 0.01) in group CON and group MP, respectively. The CAS was decreased in group CON (P < 0.01). Compared with preoperative records, the degree of diplopia was not significantly different in group CON (U = 131.0, P = 0.309) and group MP (U = 157.5, P = 0.881). Diplopia resolved in 7 cases (39%) of group CON, 5 cases (28%) of group MP. New-onset diplopia or its aggravation was recorded in 3 cases (17%) of group CON, 4 cases (22%) of group MP. The other postoperative improvement included recovered color vision, reduced intraocular pressure, and healing keratopathy. The important complications were intraoperative dural tears, new-onset diplopia and ocular inferior displacement.The modified orbital decompression offers wide exposure to the three orbital walls, marked proptosis reduction, and no apparent scar. It is efficacious and safety for the treatment of CON and inflammatory activity of TAO without serious complications, meanwhile, has little risk of induced diplopia.",

Participants: Twenty-six New Zealand rabbits. Methods: Establishing rabbit orbital blowout fracture model, the right orbit of twenty rabbits was repaired by hydroxyapatite (HA) parceled of amniotic membrane, and left orbit was only repaired by HA, the orbits of the other six rabbits weren't repaired. Then we got the tissue around bone after one week and one month, and compared the difference of three groups. Main Outcome Measures: Inflammatory response of tissue around bone was analyzed by HE, picric acid Sirius Scarlet dying, TGF-\u03b2 immunohistochemical observation. Results: One week after operation, HE and immunohistochemistry showed that the difference was not significant in inflammatory response between experimental group and control group (P= 0.351, P=0.413), and difference is significant between blank group and experimental group (P= 0.012, P=0.041). One month after operation, HE and immunohistochemistry showed that the difference was significant in inflammatory response between experimental group and control group(P=0.037, P=0.048), and there is no significant difference between experimental group and blank group(P=0.285, P=0.472). Conclusion: It has an important role of anti-inflammatory, and anti-adhesion in the chronic stage of inflammatory after orbital blowout fracture repaired by man-made plates of amniotic membrane.",

        "abstract": "To determine the types, frequency, and clinical features of infrequent bilateral orbital lesions.We reviewed 41 cases of either histopathologically or radiologically verified bilateral orbital lesions. The number and entities in each category were recorded. Clinical data and imaging findings were reviewed.The number and percentage of lesions in each general category were leukemia lesions in eight patients (19.5%), metastatic tumors in seven (17%), optic nerve and meningeal tumors in six (14.6%), secondary tumors in six (14.6%), peripheral nerve lesions in four (9.8%), inflammatory lesions in four (9.8%), and vasculogenic, histiocytic, and miscellaneous lesions, each in two patients (4.9%). These lesions occurred in both childhood and adulthood, but were infrequent in people over 60 years old. Of all cases, 51.2% were benign and 48.8% were malignant. The ocular symptoms and signs presented unilaterally in 18 (43.9%) cases and bilaterally in 23 (56.1%). Of the 15 patients with either metastatic tumors or blood disorders, two (13.3%) had a history of primary neoplasm at presentation. In 19 (46.3%) cases, the configuration of the bilateral lesions was symmetrical, and they were of equal size. Computed tomography scans revealed bone changes in 13 patients (31.7%), while magnetic resonance imaging revealed intracranial extension in nine (22%).Varied lesions can involve the bilateral orbits simultaneously or on follow-up. Through the combination of history, bilateral ocular manifestations, radiologic findings, and systemic examinations, the correct diagnosis can be made, which is valuable for early identification of both metastasis and blood disorders.",

The diagnosis of residual grease in the injured orbit was confirmed by CT and MRI, and the clinical presentation. During orbital exploration, the grease was removed completely. Among the wide variety of orbital foreign bodies, grease is rarely reported.

        "abstract": "Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare soft tissue neoplasm. The incidence of orbital involvement is the highest in ASPS arising in the head and neck region. However, limited information is available regarding its clinical characteristics. The present study presents the clinical manifestations, imaging findings, pathological features, treatment strategies and prognosis records of 8 cases of orbital ASPS over the last 15 years in a single hospital, along with a review of the literature. Included were 3 male and 5 female patients, with the median age at presentation being 9.5 years. The mean average largest tumour diameter was 3.6 cm. A total of 5 patients underwent surgical excision of the tumour, with 2 undergoing orbital exenteration and 1 undergoing partial orbital exenteration. In total, 6 patients received postoperative radiotherapy and 2 received chemotherapy. Upon follow-up, 6 patients were doing well with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis. Local recurrence developed in 2 patients, of whom 1 succumbed following withdrawal from treatment. According to the present series and the cases mentioned in the literature, orbital alveolar soft part sarcoma has characteristics distinct from those of alveolar soft part sarcoma which arises in other locations. Orbital alveolar soft part sarcoma presents itself in a younger population with a shorter course of disease, smaller tumour size, improved prognosis, a marked association with the extraocular muscles and with the Ki-67 proliferation index possibly associated with prognosis of the disease.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate indications, complications and surgical technique in the endonasal endoscopic approach to orbital tumor resection. In this retrospective review, 11 patients who admitted and underwent endoscopic orbital surgery were reviewed. Demographics, preoperative and postoperative eye examination, and size and imaging characteristics of the tumours were tabulated. The endonasal approach was selected for tumors located nasal to optic nerve and in medial-inferior orbit to orbital apex. Under general anaesthesia, ethmoidotomy was performed with the aid of endonasal endoscope. The lamina papyracea was then fenestrated and through that opening, the intraorbital tumor was isolated and removed. If necessary, an auxiliary transcaruncular incision was made to facilitate the exposure. An en bloc removal of tumors was achieved in all cases. Pathological examination has confirmed that 9 patients had cavernous haemangioma, 1 patient had schwannoma and 1 had dermoid cyst. The dimension of tumors ranged from 15 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 10 mm3 to 24 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 16 mm3. Four tumours were located nasal to the muscular cone and 5 tumors were in the muscle cone, 1 tumor in the medial rectus. After operation, the best-corrected visual acuity improved in 3 patients, with a full recovery of visual field defects. Two patients had impaired visual acuity. Three patients had transient limitation of ocular movements. Abduction and adduction remain restricted in 1 case, respectively. Combination of endonasal endoscopy and orbital surgery technique can improve safety and efficacy in the transethmoidal resection of medial or inferior orbital tumours or orbital apex tumours.",

Besides the influence of sedimentation, low geothermic gradient, high deposition rate, high heating rate, high hydrocarbon generation intensity and overpressure are main factors for the formation of anomaly high porosity intervals in deep buried reservoirs of the Bohai Bay basin, because they affected the course and intensity of diagenesis. The relatively high porosity and high permeability intervals were best developed in the Huanghua depression, and second in the Liaohe depression, and worst in the Jizhong depression.",

Simulation results indicate that the Ordovician carbonates were in the early diagentic stage during the Caledonian epoch, and were in the middle diagenetic stage A from the Hercynianin epoch to the Indo-Chinese epoch,and entered the middle diagenetic stage B in the Yanshan epoch. From Paleogene till present, the carbonates in the lower interval of Ordovician have been in the late diagenetic stage, but the carbonates in the middle and upper intervals of Ordovician were still in the middle diagenetic stage. At present, the Ordovician carbonates are in the middle diagenetic stage B in the southern and northern Huanghua depression, which is favorable for generation and accumulation of natural gas. While the Ordovician carbonates are in the middle diagenetic stage A in the middle part of the Huanghua depression, which is favorable for generation and accumulation of liquid hydrocarbons, thus this area is favorable for oil exploration.",

These deep-buried reservoirs' petrophysical property is still controlled by their sedimentary facies, and the sandbodies of fluvial and delta facies are still higher in porosity after their later modification. In depressions with high potential of hydrocarbon generation, secondary porosity is relatively developed in reservoirs because large amounts of organic acids are expelled from source rocks. The high rate of heating is favorable to early generation, expulsion and charge of hydrocarbon, which may inhibit cementation and maintain porosity in reservoirs. Overpressures may play a role in protection of reservoir porosity because they can increase active energy of chemical reactions, retard generation and expulsion of organic acids from source rocks and solution of reservoirs, and decrease effects of mechanical compaction on reservoir porosity.",

The anomalously high porosity zones are dominantly formed in the channel mouth bar,(braided) channel and channel bar deposits in the early diagenetic stage B period to late diagenetic stage A_1(period,) and developed dissolution diagenetic facieses.Therefore,the anomalously high porosity zones in the(reservoirs) could be blocked out by superposing the diagenetic facies maps on the microfacies maps.The anomalously high porosity zone of the Shasan member is mainly located in the middle slope part of the Yuanyanggou area, and extends along the western slope of the Liaohe Depression.",

The diagenetic physical simulating experiments were done at different temperatures and under 25 Mpa and 55 Mpa, respectively to study the relationships between the overpressures and the organic acid generation in mudstones and the dissolution of reservoirs. The residual total organic acid contents in the samples under 25 MPa are lower than those under 55 MPa at the same temperatures, whereas the generated total organic acids contents under 25 MPa are higher than those under 55 MPa, suggesting that pressure retards the organic acid generating. The porosity data from the different pressure settings also supports the results. The main secondary porosity zone of Well GS48 with overpressures is 580 m deeper than that of Well QN2 with no overpressure; overpressures retard the organic acids generation and result in the delay of reservoirs dissolution. The hydrocarbon exploration in deep basins should be focused on the over-pressured formations.",

        "abstract": "Endemicity of cryptosporidiosis in India has been documented with little genetic characterization of the parasites. Fifty Cryptosporidium-positive specimens collected between 2001 and 2004 from pediatric patients in Kolkata, India were analyzed for parasite genetic structure using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Genotype analyses showed the presence of Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium meleagridis and Cryptosporidium felis in 49, 2 and 1 patients, respectively (two patients had mixed infections of C. hominis and C. meleagridis). To assess the extent of genetic heterogeneity of C. hominis, minisatellites, microsatellites and polymorphic markers in three different chromosomes were sequenced, including genes encoding the 60kDa glycoprotein (GP60), a 47kDa protein (CP47), a mucin-like protein (Mucin1), a serine repeat antigen (MSC6-7), and a 56kDa trans-membrane protein (CP56) in chromosome 6, the 70kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) in chromosome 2, and a T-rich gene fragment (Chrom3T) in chromosome 3. Population sub-structure of C. hominis based on multilocus gene sequences showed that there were 25 multilocus subtypes defined by combined sequence length and nucleotide polymorphism, which formed four distinct groups in this population. Significant intra- and inter-genic linkage disequilibria were observed with minimum recombination or expansion of limited subtypes, all indicative of a mostly clonal population structure. The results highlight the importance of high resolution MLST in studying Cryptosporidium population sub-structure especially when length polymorphism may be inadequate in identifying unique subtypes. The significance of the diverse MLST within C. hominis in relation to geographical and temporal factors and clinical manifestations of disease warrants further investigations.",

To better characterize the immune response to these parasites, we monitored immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels in a cohort of children from Lima, Peru. Two new enzyme- linked immunosorbent assays based on the C. parvum (bovine, subtype IIa) Iowa strain 17-kDa and 27-kDa antigens were used to measure IgG antibody levels in longitudinal serum samples. Antibody responses were detected during infections with C. parvum, C. felis, and C. meleagridis and with four different subtypes of C. hominis. We also noted that the magnitude of the antibody response was related to the number of previous infections and that older children generally had higher levels of antibodies to the two C. parvum antigens. Antibody responses were not associated with infections with either Cyclospora sp. or Giardia sp. We believe the antibody assays will be important tools for monitoring the success of future public health interventions.",

In addition, subtyping was carried out by sequencing the 60\u2009kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene from the same single oocyst. Faecal samples were collected from 40 pre-weaned calves (5-20 days old) from 7 dairy farms located in 3 different counties within the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York. All the samples were microscopically positive for Cryptosporidium spp. A total of 400 Cryptosporidium oocysts (10 single oocysts from each calf sample) were individually isolated and analyzed using a nested PCR targeting the SSU rRNA gene. The SSU rRNA gene was amplified in 324 (81%) individual oocysts. All SSU rRNA amplified individual oocysts DNA was genotyped using PCR-RFLP. C. parvum was the only identified species; 107 single oocysts generated PCR products from the A gene, 18 generated PCR products from the B gene and 199 generated PCR products from both. Sequence analysis of the gp60 gene in 99 individual oocysts revealed the presence of only subtype IIaA15G2R1 with 99.4-100% and 99.1-100% identity of nucleotides and amino acids, respectively. These sequences were identical (100%) in oocysts from 35 calves and exhibited mutations in the non-repeat region of the gp60 gene in those of 5 other calves. The examination of DNA from individual oocysts with genotyping and subtyping tools provides methodology to more clearly define the genetic characteristics of Cryptosporidium spp. on farms and within individual animals.",

The data generated by both techniques were significantly correlated (P < 0.002), providing additional evidence to support the clonal population structure hypothesis for Cryptosporidium. Phylogenetic analysis of both 18S sequence information and RAPD analysis grouped the majority of reptile isolates together into 1 main group attributed to Cryptosporidium serpentis, which was genetically distinct but closely related to C. muris. A second genotype exhibited by 1 reptile isolate (S6) appeared to be intermediate between C. serpentis and C. muris but grouped most closely with C. muris, as it exhibited 99.15% similarity with C. muris and only 97.13% similarity with C. serpentis.

A total of 255 specimens from 23 species of wild mammals and 67 samples from stormwater were analyzed. Seventy-four (29.0%) of the wildlife specimens and 39 (58.2%) of the stormwater samples from streams were PCR positive. Altogether, 20 E. bieneusi genotypes were found, including 8 known genotypes and 12 new ones. Sixteen and five of the genotypes were seen in animals and stormwater from the watershed, respectively, with WL4 being the most common genotype in both animals (35 samples) and stormwater (23 samples). The 20 E. bieneusi genotypes belonged to five genogroups (groups 1, 3, 4, and 7 and an outlier), with only 23/113 (20.4%) E. bieneusi-positive samples belonging to zoonotic genogroup 1 and 3/20 genotypes ever being detected in humans. The two genogroups previously considered host specific, groups 3 and 4, were both detected in multiple groups of mammals. Thus, with the exception of the type IV, Peru11, and D genotypes, which were detected in only 7, 5, and 2 animals, respectively, most E. bieneusi strains in most wildlife samples and all stormwater samples in the watershed had no known public health significance, as these types have not previously been detected in humans. The role of different species of wild mammals in the contribution of E. bieneusi contamination in stormwater was supported by determinations of host-adapted Cryptosporidium species/genotypes in the same water samples. Data from this study indicate that the host specificity of E. bieneusi group 3 is broader than originally thought, and wildlife is the main source of E. bieneusi in stormwater in the watershed.",

We conducted sequence analyses of 32 genetic loci of 53 C. hominis specimens isolated from a longitudinally followed cohort of children living in a small community. We identified by linkage disequilibrium and recombination analyses only limited genetic recombination, which occurred exclusively within the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene subtype IbA10G2, a predominant subtype for outbreaks in industrialized nations and a virulent subtype in the study community. Intensive transmission of virulent subtype IbA10G2 in the study area might have resulted in genetic recombination with other subtypes. Moreover, we identified selection for IbA10G2 at a 129-kb region around the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene in chromosome 6. These findings improve our understanding of the origin and evolution of C. hominis subtypes and the spread of virulent subtypes.",

Since heme-compounds are potent catalysts of lipid peroxidation, we evaluated the catalytic ability of Plasmodium falciparum-derived hemozoin to oxidize arachidonic acid to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). Hemozoin, beta-hematin, and hematin all catalyzed the formation of 15-, 12- and 5-HETE as major products. Although there were no significant differences in total amounts of HETEs generated by hemozoin relative to hematin or beta-hematin, there were significant differences in the proportions of certain isomers. 15-HETE was the predominant isomer generated by hemozoin catalysis while 5-HETE was the major product formed by hematin catalysis. Since HETEs are important vasoactive mediators, the non-enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid by hemozoin catalysis may contribute to some of the pathophysiology associated with severe and cerebral malaria.",

On the basis of the analysis of the small-subunit rRNA gene by PCR, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing, 49 (23.4%) of 209 fecal specimens collected from 10 sites (76.9%) were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. The following five Cryptosporidium species and genotypes were identified: Cryptosporidium goose genotype I (in 36 specimens), Cryptosporidium goose genotype II (in 9 specimens), Cryptosporidium duck genotype (in 1 specimen), Cryptosporidium parvum (in 4 specimens), and C. hominis (in 2 specimens). Cryptosporidium goose genotype I was the most prevalent parasite and was found at all five Cryptosporidium-positive sites in Ohio and at four of five positive sites in Illinois, followed by Cryptosporidium goose genotype II, which was found at two of five positive sites in Ohio and at four of five positive sites in Illinois. Cryptosporidium goose genotype II was detected for the first time, and it is phylogenetically related to goose genotype I and the duck genotype. All three genotypes have not so far been reported in humans, and their pathogenicity in geese has not been determined. Only 10.2% of the Cryptosporidium-positive specimens had C. parvum and C. hominis. The results of this study indicate that Canada geese might only serve as accidental carriers of cryptosporidia infectious to humans and probably play a minor role in the animal-to-human transmission cycle of the pathogen.",

Three real-time PCR assays based on the B1 gene and a 529-bp repetitive element were analyzed for the detection of T. gondii tachyzoites and oocysts. Lower sensitivity and specificity were obtained with the B1 gene-based PCR than with the 529-bp repeat-based PCR. New procedures for the real-time PCR detection of T. gondii oocysts in concentrates of surface water were developed and tested in conjunction with a method for the direct extraction of inhibitor-free DNA from water. This technique detected as few as one oocyst seeded to 0.5 ml of packed pellets from water samples concentrated by Envirocheck filters. Thus, this real-time PCR may provide a detection method alternative to the traditional mouse assay and microscopy.",

        "abstract": "We described here a bioluminescence-based immunoassay for the quantitation of RT-PCR amplified cytokine mRNA. This technique uses a standard RT-PCR procedure, with the following modifications. The forward primer in the PCR reaction is labeled with a 5' biotin molecule. Following PCR, a digoxigenin-conjugated oligonucleotide probe is hybridized to the target biotin-labeled DNA template. The hybridized duplex is captured onto a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate. The bound product is quantitated by adding digoxigenin-specific antibodies conjugated with the photoprotein aequorin. The amount of specific DNA captured onto the plate is quantitated by triggering the bioluminescence reaction through the addition of calcium ions. This technique detected as low as 40 amol of amplified cytokine products, or 500 copies of templates when 27 PCR cycles were used. The high sensitivity of this technique enables the quantitation of target DNA during the exponential phase of the PCR reaction. The aequorin-bioluminescence assay is an alterative non-radioactive method for the quantitation of PCR products.",

        "abstract": "Few studies have examined the molecular epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in developing countries. In this study, DNA of 69 microscopy-positive human fecal samples collected from Malawi were examined by multilocus genetic analyses. From 43, 27 and 28 of the samples, the SSU rRNA, 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) and 60 kDa glycoprotein (GP60) genes, respectively, were successfully PCR-amplified. Restriction analysis of the SSU PCR products showed that 41 of the 43 PCR-positive samples had C. hominis and 2 had C. parvum. Sequence analysis of the HSP70 and GP60 gene confirmed the species identification by SSU rRNA PCR-RFLP analysis, but also revealed high intraspecific variations. Altogether, six HSP70 subtypes and six GP60 subtypes (belonging to four subtype alleles) of C. hominis were found. Linkage disequilibrum analysis of the two genetic loci showed possible intraspecific recombination. Thus, cryptosporidiosis in the study area was largely caused by anthroponotic transmission. The high intraspecific variation and existence of genetic recombination were probably results of high transmission of cryptosporidiosis in this area.",

We conducted a genomic survey of the species, developed a subtyping tool targeting the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene, and identified 6 subtype families (XIIa-XIIf) of C. ubiquitum. Host adaptation was apparent at the gp60 locus; subtype XIIa was found in ruminants worldwide, subtype families XIIb-XIId were found in rodents in the United States, and XIIe and XIIf were found in rodents in the Slovak Republic. Humans in the United States were infected with isolates of subtypes XIIb-XIId, whereas those in other areas were infected primarily with subtype XIIa isolates. In addition, subtype families XIIb and XIId were detected in drinking source water in the United States. Contact with C. ubiquitum-infected sheep and drinking water contaminated by infected wildlife could be sources of human infections.",

To assess the importance of these animals as a source of human G. duodenalis infections and determine the epidemiology of bovine giardiasis in India, fecal samples from 180 calves, heifers and adults and 51 dairy farm workers on two dairy farms in West Bengal, India were genotyped by PCR-RFLP analysis of the \u03b2-giardin gene of G. duodenalis followed by DNA sequencing of the nested PCR products. The overall prevalence of G. duodenalis in cattle was 12.2% (22/180), the infection being more prevalent in younger calves than in adult cattle. Zoonotic G. duodenalis Assemblage A1 was identified in both calves and workers although the most prevalent genotype detected in cattle was a novel Assemblage E subgenotype. These findings clearly suggest that there is a potential risk of zoonotic transmission of G. duodenalis infections between cattle and humans on dairy farms in India.",

This preliminary study was conducted to examine the identity of Cryptosporidium subtypes and E. bieneusi genotypes in dromedary camels in Algeria. A total of 39 fecal specimens were collected from young camels. PCR-sequence analysis of the small subunit rRNA was used to detect and genotype Cryptosporidium spp. Cryptosporidium parvum present was further subtyped by sequence analysis of the 60\u00a0kDa glycoprotein gene. PCR-sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer gene was used to detect and genotype E. bieneusi. Altogether, two and eight of the specimens analyzed were positive for C. parvum and E. bieneusi, respectively. The former was identified as a new subtype that is genetically related to the C. hominis If subtype family, whereas the latter was identified as two related genotypes (Macaque1 and a novel genotype) in the newly assigned E. bieneusi genotype group 8. Although they are not known hosts for C. parvum and E. bieneusi, camels are apparently infected with genetically distinct variants of these pathogens.",

All 3 SU rRNA gene-based tools could amplify the DNA of 7 Cryptosporidium spp. efficiently. However, the tools based on the antigens TRAP-C1, TRAP-C2 and COWP genes, the housekeeping genes HSP70 and DHFR, or a genomic sequence, failed to detect the DNA of C. felis, C. canis, Cryptosporidium pig genotype I, and C. muris. With the exception of 1 tool based on the TRAP-C2 gene, the PCR-RFLP or the PCR sequencing tools evaluated in this study could differentiate C. hominis, C. parvum and C. meleagridis from each other, and 2 SSU rRNA gene-based tools could differentiate all 7 Cryptosporidium spp. Thus, a thorough understanding of the strength and weakness of each technique is needed when using molecular diagnostic tool in epidemiological investigations of human cryptosporidiosis.",

        "abstract": "Few data are available on the molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium spp. in chickens and ducks in China. In this study, 2579 faecal samples from 46 chicken farms and eight Pekin duck farms in 21 prefectures in Henan Province were examined. The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium was 10.6% (163/1542) in layer chickens (10 out of 17 farms), 3.4% (16/473) in broilers (five out of 29 farms), and 16.3% (92/564) in Pekin ducks (four out of eight farms), respectively. The highest infection rates were observed in 31-day-old to 60-day-old layer chickens (24.6%) and 11-day-old to 30-day-old Pekin ducks (40.3%). The season of highest prevalence in chickens was spring (15.6%) and the lowest was winter (P<0.01). One hundred and eighty-seven Cryptosporidium-positive samples were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the small subunit rRNA gene, and 55 were further analysed by DNA sequencing of the PCR products. Two Cryptosporidium species were identified: Cryptosporidium baileyi (184/187) on 15 chicken farms and four duck farms, and Cryptosporidium meleagridis (3/187) on three layer chicken farms. C. baileyi was the predominant Cryptosporidium species, found in all age groups of chickens and all Cryptosporidium-positive ducks examined, whereas C. meleagridis was only identified in 31-day-old to 120-day-old layer chickens. Considering the large size of the chicken industry and the close contact between chickens and humans, and that C. meleagridis is the third most common Cryptosporidium parasite in humans, then C. meleagridis could potentially become an emerging zoonosis in some areas in China.",

        "abstract": "Molecular epidemiological analysis of cryptosporidiosis in Middle Eastern countries suggests that small ruminants could play a major role in the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. to humans, with a dominance of Cryptosporidium parvum, especially its IId subtypes. However, little information is available on the epidemiology and risk factors of cryptosporidiosis as well the distribution of Cryptosporidium species/genotypes and subtypes in small ruminants in this area, including Kuwait. In the present study, 47 farms from several areas in Kuwait were visited once during October 2014 to September 2015 to collect data on risk factors associated with Cryptosporidium infection. Fecal samples from 334 sheep and 222 goats were examined for Cryptosporidium oocysts by Ziehl-Neelsen staining (ZN) and antigens by enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). The Cryptosporidium prevalence was higher when samples were examined by EIA than ZN (11.4 and 7.2% in sheep and goats by EIA, compared with 4.2 and 3.6% by ZN, respectively). Young age (less than 3\u00a0months) and closed housing system are risk factors of Cryptosporidium infection. A correlation between fecal consistency and the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. was observed; non-formed fecal samples were often found positive. Molecular characterization of 30 ovine and caprine samples using PCR-RFLP analysis of the small subunit rRNA gene revealed the presence of C. parvum in 23 samples, Cryptosporidium ubiquitum in five samples, and Cryptosporidium xiaoi in two samples. Sequence analysis of C. parvum at the 60 KDa glycoprotein gene locus identified two subtypes, IIaA15G2R1 and IIdA20G1, with the latter being more common (in 2 and 20 successfully subtyped samples, respectively). Only one subtype of C. ubiquitum (XIIa) was recorded. Cryptosporidiosis in small ruminants apparently poses public health problem in Kuwait.",

BoG2-infected pigs developed significantly more severe disease than did HuG1-infected pigs. BoG2 parasites were seen microscopically throughout the intestines during the prepatent and patent periods. HuG1 parasites were only detected during the patent period in the ileum and colon but colonized the mucosal surface in significantly larger numbers than did BoG2. Moderate-to-severe villus/mucosal attenuation with lymphoid hyperplasia was seen throughout the intestines of BoG2-infected pigs, whereas lesions in HuG1-infected pigs were mild to moderate and restricted to the ileum and colon. These findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that human and bovine C. parvum genotypes may be separate species.",

        "abstract": "The Cryptosporidium in the small intestine of domestic mice (Mus musculus) was initially described as Cryptosporidium parvum. Recent genetic and biologic characterization of Cryptosporidium isolates indicate that domestic mice are infected with several morphologically indistinguishable intestinal Cryptosporidium parasites with different host specificities, including C. parvum sensu stricto, mouse genotype I, and mouse genotype II. In this study, the morphological, biological, and genetic characteristics of the Cryptosporidium mouse genotype I are described. As a full re-description of C. parvum was made in 1985 for isolates from calves and humans and the name C. parvum has been widely used for the parasite that is infectious to both ruminants and humans, the mouse genotype I is named as Cryptosporidium tyzzeri. Oocysts of the new species (4.64\u00b10.05 \u03bcm \u00d74.19\u00b10.06 \u03bcm, with a mean shape index of 1.11\u00b10.02; n=69) are slightly smaller than those of the re-described C. parvum. The prepatent period was six and seven days, and the patent period was 24-28 and 28-29 days in neonatal and adult mice, respectively. Oocysts were not infectious to lambs and calves. Light, transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy studies of the new species showed the presence of developmental stages in the microvillar brush border of the jejunum and ileum of experimentally infected mice, with the infection most intensive in the ileum. It had nucleotide sequences significantly different from C. parvum at the small subunit rRNA, 70 kDa heat shock protein, oocyst wall protein, actin, and the 60 kDa glycoprotein genes. Based on the morphological, genetic, and biological data and in compliance of established Cryptosporidium species naming criteria, this geographically widespread parasite is named as a new species in honor of Ernest Edward Tyzzer, who pioneered Cryptosporidium research.",

There were eight  genotypes in Tibetan sheep, including three known ones (BEB6, COS-I, and NESH5) and five novel ones (named as CHS13-CHS17). Similarly, seven  genotypes were found in yaks, including five known ones (J, BEB4, BEB6, COS-I, and NESH5) and two novel ones (named as CHN13 and CHN14). Most of the  genotypes and all frequent ones identified in the study belonged to group 2. One new subgroup of genotypes was identified within group 1. The distribution of  genotypes was different between Tibetan sheep and yaks, with BEB6 as the dominant one (42.5%) in Tibetan sheep and J as the dominant one (47.5%) in yaks. These data support the occurrence of host adaptation among  genotypes within group 2.",

Cryptosporidium spp. in 17 microscopy-positive specimens from calves were genotyped by DNA sequence analysis of the small-subunit rRNA gene, and Cryptosporidium parvum was subtyped by sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein gene. Cryptosporidium ryanae was found in 10 specimens and C. parvum in 7 specimens, with the former belonging to the newly identified C. ryanae buffalo variant and the latter belonging to the subtypes IIdA20G1 (in 5 specimens) and IIaA15G1R1 (in 2 specimens). The prevailing occurrence of C. ryanae and the subtype family IId of C. parvum and the absence of C. bovis and C. andersoni represent some features of Cryptosporidium transmission in water buffaloes in Egypt.",

Tyzzer in 1907 (58) and over 30 years since the identification of Cryptosporidium as a human pathogen in 1976 (38, 40). Cryptosporidiosis remains an im- portant opportunistic pathogen in human immunodeficiency virus-positive persons. This is due largely to the limited use of highly active antiretroviral therapy in developing countries and the lack of an effective drug against the parasite in immuno- compromised persons. Recent research efforts in cryptospo- ridiosis are directed largely at characterizations of environ- mental ecology, infection source, and risk factors using molecular diagnostic tools, identifications of parasite-unique biochemical and metabolic pathways for drug development, and elucidations of immune responses and pathogenesis. These efforts have been greatly facilitated by the recent com- pletion of whole-genome sequencing of Cryptosporidium par- vum, Cryptosporidium hominis, and Cryptosporidium muris. The 26 research studies presented at the 10th International Work- shop on Opportunistic Protists (IWOP-10) clearly reflected the current trends in cryptosporidiosis research.",

        "abstract": "We genotyped 297 Scottish C. parvum samples using micro- and minisatellites. Treated as a single population, the population structure was epidemic. When regional populations were analysed, there was evidence of sub-population structure variations. This was dependent upon excluding sub-groups exhibiting significant genetic distance from the main population, implying genetic sub-structuring. We tested the hypothesis that these sub-groups originated outside the UK and demonstrated that one sub-group clustered with Peruvian samples. A geographically comprehensive panel of isolates would fully confirm this result. These data indicate limited sub-structuring within a small geographical area, but substantial sub-structuring over larger geographical distances. Host movement influences parasite diversity and population structure, evidenced by strong correlation ( r 2 = 0.9686) between cattle movements and parasite diversity. Thus, the population structure of C. parvum is complex, with sub-populations differing in structure and being influenced by host movements, including the introduction of novel multilocus genotypes from geographically distinct regions.

These tools have been increasingly used in the characterization of the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. This review addresses the most recent developments in molecular epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis.The recent development of subtyping tools has led to better understanding of the population genetics and transmission of Cryptosporidium in humans. The population structure of C. parvum and C. hominis is apparently more complicated than previously suggested, with the likely existence of both clonal and panmictic populations. Thus, the transmission of C. parvum (genotype II) in humans is shown to be different in different areas, with zoonotic transmission important in certain places and anthroponotic transmission in others. The use of molecular tools has also led to the identification of geographic and temporal differences in the transmission of C. parvum and C. hominis, and better appreciation of the public health importance of other Cryptosporidium species/genotypes and the frequency of infections with mixed genotypes or subtypes.Factors involved in the transmission of human cryptosporidiosis are difficult to examine using conventional methods. The use of molecular tools has been helpful in the assessment of the zoonotic potential of various Cryptosporidium spp. and sources of human infections, and has started to play a significant role in the characterization of transmission dynamic in endemic and epidemic areas.",

        "abstract": "To identify the genotype and subtype distributions of Cryptosporidium oocysts in domestic wastewater in Shanghai, China, and to facilitate the characterization of the endemic transmission of cryptosporidiosis, raw domestic wastewater samples were collected from four wastewater treatment plants in Shanghai, China, from December 2006 to April 2007. Genotypes of Cryptosporidium species were detected based on PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analyses of the small-subunit rRNA gene. Samples that contained Cryptosporidium hominis were further subtyped by DNA sequencing of the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene. Among a total of 90 samples analyzed, 63 were PCR positive, 10 of which had mixed genotypes. Fifty-nine (93.7%) of the PCR-positive samples had C. hominis, and 7 (11.1%) had C. meleagridis. The other seven Cryptosporidium species/genotypes identified included C. baileyi, C. parvum, C. suis, C. muris, rat genotype, avian genotype III, and a novel genotype. Forty-seven of the 59 C. hominis-positive samples were successfully subtyped, with 29 having subtype family Ib and the remaining belonging to subtype families Ia, Id, Ie, and If. The three Ib subtypes identified, IbA19G2, IbA20G2, and IbA21G2, were very different from the two common Ib subtypes (IbA9G3 and IbA10G2) found in other areas of the world. Likewise, the Ie subtype IeA12G3T3 was also different from the common IeA11G3T3 subtype. Thus, the presence of multiple subtype families and unique Ib, Ie, and If subtypes indicates that there might be endemic transmission of cryptosporidiosis in the study area and that C. hominis populations there might be very different from those in other areas.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies in the United States reported that approximately 85% of pre-weaned dairy calves were infected with zoonotic Cryptosporidium parvum, whereas only 1-2% of post-weaned calves and 1-2-year-old heifers were infected with this species. Cryptosporidium bovis and Cryptosporidium deer-like genotype were much more prevalent in the post-weaned animals. It is not clear whether the same infection pattern also occurs in other geographic areas. In this study, to determine whether the same Cryptosporidium infection pattern was present in other geographic areas, we genotyped Cryptosporidium specimens collected from two farms in China and India, using specimens from farms in Georgia, USA for comparison. C. bovis was the most common species found in pre- and post-weaned calves in all three areas. In Georgia, the deer-like genotype was found frequently in pre- and post-weaned calves and Cryptosporidium andersoni was found in one post-weaned calf. Both C. bovis and the deer-like genotype were found in the few milking cows examined in Georgia. There were no differences in the small subunit rRNA gene sequences obtained from C. bovis or deer-like genotype among the three areas. One adult yak in China, however, was infected with a species similar to C. bovis, with only three nucleotide mutations in the target gene. All four common bovine Cryptosporidium spp. were differentiated from each other by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR products with enzymes SspI and MboII. Thus, both C. bovis and the deer-like genotype are found in all age groups of cattle in diverse geographic areas and host adaptation of C. bovis might have occurred in yaks.",

        "abstract": "Captive nonhuman primates have been identified as common hosts of Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium hominis, and Cyclospora spp., thus are potential reservoirs of some enteric parasites in humans. However, few studies have examined the source and human-infective potential of enteric parasites in laboratory nonhuman primates. In the present work, 205 fecal specimens were collected from three groups of captive Macaca fascicularis kept in different densities in a laboratory animal facility in Guangxi, China, and examined by PCR for E. bieneusi, G. duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp., and Cyclospora spp. The infection rates of E. bieneusi and G. duodenalis were 11.3% and 1.2% in Group 1 (young animals kept individually; n=168), 72.2% and 11.1% in Group 2 (young animals kept in groups; n=18), and 31.6% and 5.3% in Group 3 (adults kept in groups; n=19), respectively. Sequence analysis of PCR products showed the presence of five E. bieneusi genotypes, with genotype D (in 16/36 genotyped specimens) and a new genotype (in 15/36 genotyped specimens) as the dominant genotypes. All five E. bieneusi genotypes belonged to the zoonotic group (Group 1). The G. duodenalis genotypes (assemblages AII and B) in five specimens and C. hominis subtype (IdA14) in one specimen were also known human-pathogens, although the Cyclospora seen in one animal appeared to be unique to macaque monkeys. The higher infection rate in younger animals reared in groups and common occurrence of zoonotic genotypes indicated that human-pathogenic E. bieneusi could be transmitted efficiently in captive nonhuman primates, and group-housing was a risk factor for transmission of zoonotic pathogens in young nonhuman primates in research facilities.",

        "abstract": "The United States has experienced a substantial increase in the reported incidence of cryptosporidiosis since 2005. Accompanying this is the emergence of a new subtype of Cryptosporidium hominis based on variation at the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) locus, IaA28R4, which has become a frequently identified subtype in both sporadic and outbreak-related cases. In this study, using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) at eight genetic loci, we characterized 62 specimens of IaA28R4 and 33 specimens of three other gp60 subtypes of C. hominis from four U.S. states with increased cryptosporidiosis incidences during the summer of 2008. Extensive genetic heterogeneity was seen within the gp60 subtype IaA28R4, but specimens from Ohio and southwestern states formed two distinct subpopulations, suggesting that there were at least two origins of IaA28R4 within the United States. Discordance in typing results was observed between gp60 and other genetic markers, especially DZ-HRGP, and this discordance was largely the result of genetic recombination within the gp60 subtype IaA28R4. The results of population genetic analyses supported the presence of two subpopulations of IaA28R4 and the occurrence of genetic recombination within this gp60 subtype. Thus, the IaA28R4 subtype at gp60 is likely a fitness marker for C. hominis, and genetic recombination is potentially a driving force in the emergence of the virulent IaA28R4 subtype in the United States. A rapid evolution of IaA28R4 was indicated by the observation of multiple MLST subtypes of IaA28R4 within two large outbreaks that lasted for extended periods and involved multiple swimming pools.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of 11 previously described species differentiation and genotyping PCR protocols for detection of Cryptosporidium parasites. Genomic DNA from three species of Cryptosporidium parasites (genotype 1 and genotype 2 of C. parvum, C. muris, and C. serpentis), two Eimeria species (E. neischulzi and E. papillata), and Giardia duodenalis were used to evaluate the specificity of primers. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the genotyping primers was tested by using genomic DNA isolated from known numbers of oocysts obtained from a genotype 2 C. parvum isolate. PCR amplification was repeated at least three times with all of the primer pairs. Of the 11 protocols studied, 10 amplified C. parvum genotypes 1 and 2, and the expected fragment sizes were obtained. Our results indicate that two species-differentiating protocols are not Crypto- sporidium specific, as the primers used in these protocols also amplified the DNA of Eimeria species. The sensitivity studies revealed that two nested PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) protocols based on the small-subunit rRNA and dihydrofolate reductase genes are more sensitive than single-round PCR or PCR-RFLP protocols.",

The partial 18S rRNA, 70kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and actin genes of six isolates were sequenced. Sequence data were analyzed together with known Cryptosporidium spp. and genotypes. Results of this multi-locus genetic characterization indicated that the six Cryptosporidium isolates in this study shared the same sequences of the genes studied and were different from known Cryptosporidium species and genotypes. The closest relative was Cryptosporidium ferret genotype with 7, 22, 2 and 2 nucleotide differences in the 18S rRNA, HSP70, COWP and actin genes, respectively. The homology to ferret genotype at the 18S rRNA locus was 99.1%, which is comparable to that between C. parvum and C. hominis (99.2%), or between C. muris and C. andersoni (99.4%). Therefore, the Cryptosporidium in minks in this study is considered a new genotype, the Cryptosporidium mink genotype.",

In this study, 42 water samples were collected from one watershed during 20 storm events over 1 year, including duplicate or quadruplicate samples from 16 storm events. Ten samples from four events had three to eight subsamples. They were processed by EPA method 1623, and Cryptosporidium oocysts present were detected by immunofluorescent microscopy or PCR. Altogether, 24 of 39 samples (47 of 67 samples and subsamples) analyzed by microscopy were positive for Cryptosporidium. In contrast, 36 of 42 samples (62 of 76 samples and subsamples) were positive by PCR, including 10 microscopy-negative samples (13 microscopy-negative samples and subsamples). Six of the 24 microscopy-positive samples were negative by PCR, and all samples had one or less oocyst in a 0.5-ml packed pellet volume calculated. Discordant results were obtained by microscopy and PCR from six and three of the storm events, respectively, with multiple samples. Discordant microscopy or PCR results were also obtained among subsamples. Most of the 14 Cryptosporidium genotypes were found over a brief period. Cryptosporidium-positive samples had a mean of 1.9 genotypes per sample, with 39 of the 62 positive samples/subsamples having more than one genotype. Samples/subsamples with more than one genotype had an overall PCR-positive rate of 73%, compared to 34% for those with one genotype. The PCR amplification rate of samples was affected by the volume of DNA used in PCR.",

A total of 274 stool samples were collected from 100 mammals and 29 reptiles. The species and genotype of the isolates identified by light microscopy were determined by nested PCR and sequence analysis of a fragment of the small subunit rRNA gene. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in one black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou), one Prairie bison (Bison bison bison) and in one Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans). The PCR and sequence analysis of these three isolates showed that those excreted by the Prairie bison were Cryptosporidium mouse genotype, those from the black wildebeest were from a new Cryptosporidium genotype and those infecting the Indian star tortoise were Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype. The present work reports a new Cryptosporidium genotype in a black wildebeest and the first finding of the Cryptosporidium mouse genotype in a ruminant.",

        "abstract": "Isolates from 25 (13 sporadic and 12 outbreak) cryptosporidiosis cases, 24 of which were from British Columbia, Canada, were characterized using nested polymerase chain reaction amplification of the polymorphic internal transcribed spacer 1 locus. Two predominant Cryptosporidium parvum genotypes were found. Twelve (8 sporadic and 4 outbreak) isolates amplified with the cry7/cry21 primer pair and 12 (5 sporadic and 7 outbreak) isolates amplified with the cry7/cryITS1 primer pair. Multi-locus gene analysis using sequence polymorphisms on 3 other loci, i.e., the thrombospondin-related adhesion protein gene, the dihydrofolate reductase gene, and the 18S rRNA gene on 8 (4 outbreak and 4 sporadic) isolates showed non-random association among the human and animal alleles of the 4 different C. parvum gene loci. Associations between these 2 parasite genotypes and different routes of cryptosporidiosis transmission such as zoonotic, anthroponotic, and waterborne transmission were studied using municipal population and agricultural information, as well as detection of C. parvum oocysts in municipal drinking water specimens of the residential communities of sporadic and outbreak cases. Within the last 10 years, several waterborne cryptosporid- iosis outbreaks have occurred in North America. 1-3 In 1996, the western Canadian province of British Columbia experi- enced 4 consecutive community outbreaks of cryptosporid- iosis, three of which were confirmed by epidemiologic sur- veys to be caused by contaminated drinking water (Fyfe M and others, unpublished data). The sources of contaminating Cryptosporidium parvumoocysts have not been determined although in the earliest British Columbia outbreak in Cran- brook, cattle were implicated after Cryptosporidium-positive cattle manure specimens were found near the watershed in- take (Ong C and others, unpublished data). Although disease transmission from cattle has been reported previously, 4-7 in",

        "abstract": "A new species of Cryptosporidium, C. bovis, is described. Oocysts of C. bovis, previously identified as Cryptosporidium genotype Bovine B (GenBank AY120911), are morphologically indistinguishable from those of C. parvum. They are excreted fully sporulated and contain 4 sporozoites, but lack sporocysts. Oocysts measure 4.76-5.35 microm (mean = 4.89 microm) x 4.17-4.76 microm (mean = 4.63 microm), with a length-to-width ratio of 1.06 (n = 50). Oocysts were not infectious for neonatal BALB/ c mice, but were infectious for 2 calves that were previously infected with C. parvum. Oocysts were not infectious for 2 experimentally exposed lambs less than 1 wk of age and were not detected in 42 lambs 2-3 mo of age, but were detected in a 2-wk-old lamb. In an earlier study, 79 of 840 calves on 14 dairy farms in 7 states were found infected with the new species. Most calves were 2-7 mo of age and none exhibited signs of diarrhea. This new species has been found in 10 of 162 calves aged 9 to 11 mo on a beef farm in Maryland. Fragments of the 18S rDNA, HSP-70, and actin genes were amplified by PCR, and purified PCR products were sequenced. Multilocus analysis of the 3 unlinked loci demonstrated the new species to be distinct from C. parvum and also demonstrated a lack of recombination, providing further evidence of species status. Based on these biological and molecular data, we consider this highly prevalent Cryptosporidium that infects primarily postweaned calves to be a new species and propose the name Cryptosporidium bovis n. sp. for this parasite.",

        "abstract": "The limited availability of water results in the reuse of wastewater or sludge. The Tunisian wastewater regulatory guidelines\n have specific limits for ova of helminths (<1 egg/l) but none for protozoan parasites. We assessed the presence and loads\n of parasites in 20 samples of raw, treated wastewater and sludge collected from six wastewater treatment plants. Samples were\n tested by microscopy using the modified Bailenger method (MBM), immunomagnetic separation (IMS) followed by immunofluorescent\n assay microscopy, and PCR and sequence analysis for the protozoa Cryptosporidium and Giardia. The seven samples of raw wastewater had a high diversity of helminth and protozoa contamination. Giardia spp., Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Entamoeba coli, Ascaris spp., Enterobius vermicularis, and Taenia saginata were detected by MBM, and protozoan loads were greater than helminth loads. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were also detected by IMS microscopy and PCR. Six of the eight samples of treated wastewater had parasites: helminths (n\u2009=\u20091), Cryptosporidium (n\u2009=\u20091), Giardia (n\u2009=\u20094), and Entamoeba (n\u2009=\u20094). Four of five samples of sludge had microscopically detectable parasites, and all had both Cryptosporidium and Giardia. The genotypes and subtypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia were of both human and animal origin. These findings suggest that it may be important to monitor the presence of protozoan\n parasites in treated wastewater and sludge in Tunisia.",

Of 2652 patients, 66% were male, 6% received antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the median CD4 lymphocyte count was 131 cells/microL. Sixty-seven patients (3%) had microsporidiosis; stool specimens from 56 were identified as having Enterocytozoon bieneusi of 10 different genotypes. The 2 most common genotypes, Peru-1 and Peru-2, were not associated with significant increases in chronic diarrhea; other genotypes were associated with a 4-fold increased risk. Risk factors for E. bieneusi infection segregated by genotype: contact with duck or chicken droppings and lack of running water, flush toilet, or garbage collection with genotype Peru-1 and watermelon consumption with other genotypes. Shortened survival was associated with low CD4 lymphocyte count (P<.0001), no ART (P<.0001), and cryptosporidiosis (P=.004) but not with microsporidiosis (P=.48). Our data suggest the possibility of zoonotic E. bieneusi transmission and an association with poor sanitary conditions.",

In this study, we used a small-subunit rRNA-based PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique to detect and characterize Cryptosporidium oocysts in 55 samples of raw surface water collected from several areas in the United States and 49 samples of raw wastewater collected from Milwaukee, Wis. Cryptosporidium parasites were detected in 25 surface water samples and 12 raw wastewater samples. C. parvum human and bovine genotypes were the dominant Cryptosporidium parasites in the surface water samples from sites where there was potential contamination by humans and cattle, whereas C. andersoni was the most common parasite in wastewater. There may be geographic differences in the distribution of Cryptosporidium genotypes in surface water. The PCR-RFLP technique can be a useful alternative method for detection and differentiation of Cryptosporidium parasites in water.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal diarrhea is one of the most important syndromes in dairy cattle. Among enteropathogens, Cryptosporidium spp. are primary causes of diarrhea, but outbreaks due to cryptosporidiosis are rarely reported in cattle. From January to April in 2016, severe diarrhea was observed in over 400 neonatal dairy calves on a large dairy farm in Jiangsu Province of East China. Approximately 360 calves died due to watery diarrhea despite antibiotic therapy. In this study, 18 fecal specimens were collected from seriously ill calves on this farm during the diarrhea outbreak, and analyzed for common enteropathogens by enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). In a post-outbreak investigation, 418 and 1,372 specimens collected from animals of various age groups were further analyzed for rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. by EIA and PCR, respectively, to assess their roles in the occurrence of diarrhea on the farm. Cryptosporidium spp. were genotyped using established techniques. Initial EIA tests showed that 15/18 seriously ill calves during the outbreak were positive for Cryptosporidium parvum, while 8/18 were positive for rotavirus. The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium in pre-weaned calves on the farm was 22.7%, with odds of the Cryptosporidium infection during the outbreak 4.4-23.5 times higher than after the outbreak. Four Cryptosporidium spp. were identified after the outbreak including C. parvum (n = 79), Cryptosporidium ryanae (n = 48), Cryptosporidium bovis (n = 31), and Cryptosporidium andersoni (n = 3), with co-infections of multiple species being detected in 34 animals. Infection with C. parvum (73/79) was found in the majority of calves aged \u2264 3 weeks, consistent with the age of ill calves during the outbreak. All C. parvum isolates were identified as subtype IIdA19G1. In the post-outbreak investigation, C. parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves, C. ryanae infection was associated with moderate diarrhea in both pre- and post-weaned calves, while no association was identified between rotavirus infection and the occurrence of diarrhea. Results of logistic regression analysis further suggested that C. bovis infection might also be a risk factor for moderate diarrhea in calves. Thus, we believe this is the first report of a major outbreak of severe diarrhea caused by C. parvum IIdA19G1 in dairy calves. More attention should be directed toward preventing the dissemination of this virulent subtype in China.",

        "abstract": "To estimate the prevalence and public health significance of cryptosporidiosis in preweaned calves in China, 801 fecal samples from eight farms in seven areas in Henan Province were examined for Cryptosporidium oocysts. The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium was 21.5%, with the farm in Xinxiang having the highest prevalence (40%). No significant difference in infection rates was observed between seasons. Cryptosporidium spp. were characterized by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene and DNA sequencing of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. The SSU rRNA-based PCR identified four Cryptosporidium species, including Cryptosporidium parvum (54/172), C. bovis (65/172), C. ryanae (19/172), and C. andersoni (12/172), and the occurrence of infections with mixed species (22/172). The earliest detection of C. bovis was in calves of 1 week of age, showing that the prepatent period was shorter than the previously stated 10 to 12 days. Infections with C. parvum peaked in summer, whereas C. bovis dominated in autumn and winter. There was no apparent difference in the age of cattle infected with either C. parvum or C. bovis. Sequencing analysis of the gp60 gene showed all 67 C. parvum samples belonged to subtype IIdA19G1. These findings suggested that the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. in preweaned calves in Henan, China, appeared to be different from other areas both at genotype and subtype levels. Further molecular epidemiologic studies (including samples from both calves and humans) are needed to elucidate the transmission dynamics and public significance of C. parvum in cattle in China.",

We report here an immunization study in Saimiri monkeys with a multiple antigen construct (MAC) containing the P. vivax CS protein repeat region and a T helper epitope of tetanus toxin formulated in different adjuvants. Monkeys immunized three times with MAC in copolymer P1005, copolymer P1005 plus RaLPS, or MF-75 had titers of antibodies against CS repeat, sporozoites and the protective B epitope AGDR significantly higher than those immunized with MAC in alum or PBS (P < 0.05). Antibody levels in animals that received P1005 were maintained at high level for 7 months after the last immunization. Upon challenge with 10000 sporozoites 2 weeks after the last immunization, 75% (three of four) of monkeys from the alum group, 50% (three of six) of monkeys from the P1005 plus RaLPS group, 40% (two of five) of monkeys from the P1005 group, 33% (two of six) of monkeys from the MF-75 group, and 17% (one of six) of monkeys from the MAC alone group were fully protected. When immunized animals were challenged again with 30000 sporozoites 22 weeks after the last immunization. 40% (two of five) monkeys from the P1005 group were fully protected. The remaining (three) in this group developed low parasitemia (< 2000 parasites mm-3 of blood) after significantly longer prepatent period (P < 0.05). In addition, 17% (one of six) of monkeys each from the P1005 plus RaLPS and MF-75 groups were also fully protected. Protected animals had higher levels of prechallenge anti-AGDR antibody titers than unprotected (1933 vs 281 for the first challenge, P > 0.05; 21527 vs 196 for the rechallenge, P < 0.05). Anti-AGDR antibody titers were positively correlated with the prepatent period of infected animals (r = 0.42 for the first challenge, P > 0.05; r = 0.60 for the rechallenge, P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with the peak parasitemia (r = -0.39 for the first challenge, P < 0.05; r = 0.50 for the rechallenge, P < 0.05). The results suggested that when combined with the use of potent adjuvants and T helper epitopes, MAC subunit vaccines may potentially offer protection against malaria infection.",

        "abstract": "We describe here the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of a novel Cryptosporidium parvum gene, encoding a protein with significant homology to the long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (LCFA, EC 6.2.1.3). The gene has an open reading frame of 2,301 bp, coding for a 766 amino acid polypeptide, and with an estimated MW of 86.1 kDa. By indirect immunofluorescence assay, monoclonal antibodies C3CE7 and E5D labeled the anterior pole of fixed C. parvum sporozoites and developmental stages in C. parvum-infected cultures at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. These monoclonal antibodies inhibited more than 35% of parasite growth in vitro. The effect of triacsin C, a potent selective inhibitor of LCFA synthetase, on parasite growth was assessed in cell culture; complete inhibition of parasite growth at 2.5 ug/ml was obtained with little evidence of drug-associated cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the fatty acyl-CoA synthetase may be a useful target in the development of selective inhibitors and immunologic interventions against C. parvum.",

        "abstract": "Molecular characterizations of Cryptosporidium spp. in dairy cattle in industrialized nations have mostly shown a dominance of Cryptosporidium parvum, especially its IIa subtypes in pre-weaned calves. Few studies, however, have been conducted on the distribution of Cryptosporidium species and C. parvum subtypes in various age groups of dairy cattle in developing countries. In this study, we examined the prevalence and molecular characteristics of Cryptosporidium in dairy cattle in four Nile River delta provinces in Egypt. Modified Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast microscopy was used to screen for Cryptosporidium oocysts in 1974 fecal specimens from animals of different ages on 12 farms. Positive fecal specimens were identified from all studied farms with an overall prevalence of 13.6%. By age group, the infection rates were 12.5% in pre-weaned calves, 10.4% in post-weaned calves, 22.1% in heifers, and 10.7% in adults. PCR-RFLP and DNA sequence analyses of microscopy-positive fecal specimens revealed the presence of four major Cryptosporidium species. In pre-weaned calves, C. parvum was most common (30/69 or 43.5%), but Cryptosporidium ryanae (13/69 or 18.8%), Cryptosporidium bovis (7/69 or 10.2%), and Cryptosporidium andersoni (7/69 or 10.2%) were also present at much higher frequencies seen in most industrialized nations. Mixed infections were seen in 12/69 (17.4%) of genotyped specimens. In contrast, C. andersoni was the dominant species (193/195 or 99.0%) in post-weaned calves and older animals. Subtyping of C. parvum based on sequence analysis of the 60kDa glycoprotein gene showed the presence of subtypes IIdA20G1 in nine specimens, IIaA15G1R1 in 27 specimens, and a rare subtype IIaA14G1R1r1b in one specimen. The common occurrence of non-C. parvum species and IId subtypes in pre-weaned calves is a distinct feature of cryptosporidiosis transmission in dairy cattle in Egypt. The finding of the same two dominant IIa and IId C. parvum subtypes recently found in humans in Egypt suggests calves can be potential reservoirs of zoonotic cryptosporidiosis.",

        "abstract": "Saimiri boliviensis monkeys were immunized with the yeast-expressed recombinant protein yP2P30Pv20019. The antigen consisted of the C-terminus (amino acid Asn1622-Ser1729) of the merozoite surface protein 1o f thePlasmodium vivax Salvador I strain. Two universal T helper cell epitopes (P 2 and P30) of tetanus toxin and six histidine residues for purification purposes were attached to the N- and C-termini, respectively. Four groups of five monkeys were given three immunizations at four-week intervals with either 250m go f yP 2P30Pv20019 formulated with nonionic block copolymer P1005, 250 mg of antigen adsorbed to alum, 250 mg of antigen in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or PBS alone. Five weeks after the last immunization, each animal was inoculated with 100,000 parasitized erythrocytes of the Salvador I strain of P. vivax. Animals were splenectomized one week after challenge to increase parasite densities; after seven weeks of infection, animals were treated. Eighteen weeks later, the animals were rechallenged with the homologous parasite. Following the first challenge, three monkeys immunized with the antigen with P1005 were protected; no animals were protected from rechallenge. One monkey immunized with yP2 P30Pv20019 with alum was protected; no protection was seen after rechallenge. Two monkeys immunized with antigen alone were protected; none were protected from rechallenge. One control animal had a low parasite count following primary infection; none were protected against rechallenge. Adverse reactions were only observed with animals receiving P1005. It is proposed that splenectomy of the monkeys prevented adequate assessment of the efficacy of this antigen. Identification of a monkey host that supports high density parasitemia without splenectomy appears needed before further testing of blood-stage vaccines against P. vivax. Procedures are being developed and evaluated for the test- ing of different synthetic peptide and recombinant protein vaccines in animals susceptible to infection with different species of Plasmodium. A model system has been developed for the testing of vaccines directed against the sporozoites of Plasmodium vivax using the Salvador I strain of the par- asite and the nonhuman primate model of Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis. 1-7 In previous trials, immunized animals were challenged with 10,000 or more sporozoites dissected from the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes, and the animals were splenectomized one week after challenge to increase parasitemia. Infection rate was highly predictable, but pre- patent periods varied markedly. Our present study was designed to determine if this model system could be used to test the efficacy of a recombinant vaccine directed against the merozoite surface protein (MSP- 1 19 )o fP. vivax. To increase uniformity of parasitemia, all animals were challenged by the intravenous inoculation of parasitized erythrocytes. All animals were splenectomized seven or eight days after challenge. Included in the trial were two adjuvants, a nonionic block copolymer P1005, previ- ously shown to increase antibody responses,",

        "abstract": "To characterize the prevalence and assess the zoonotic transmission burden of Cryptosporidium species/genotypes in pet birds in Henan, China, 434 fecal samples were acquired from 14 families of birds in pet shops. The overall prevalence of Cryptopsoridium was 8.1% (35/434) by the Sheather's sugar flotation technique. The Cryptosporidium-positive samples were analyzed by DNA sequence analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene. Three Cryptosporidium species and two genotypes were identified, including C. baileyi (18/35 or 51.4%) in five red-billed leiothrixes (Leiothrix lutea), four white Java sparrows (Padda oryzivora), four common mynas (Acridotheres tristis), two zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a crested Lark (Galerida cristata), a Gouldian finch (Chloebia gouldiae), and a black-billed magpie (Pica pica); Cryptosporidium meleagridis (3/35 or 8.6%) in a Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus), a Rufous turtle dove (Streptopelia orientalis), and a fan-tailed pigeon (Columba livia); Cryptosporidium galli (5/35 or 14.3%) in four Bohemian waxwings (Bombycilla garrulus) and a silver-eared Mesia (Leiothrix argentauris); Cryptosporidium avian genotype III (3/35 or 8.6%) in two cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) and a red-billed blue magpie (Urocissa erythrorhyncha); and Cryptosporidium avian genotype V (6/35 or 17.1%) in six cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus). Among the pet birds, 12 species represented new hosts for Cryptosporidum infections. The presence of C. meleagridis raises questions on potential zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis from pet birds to humans.",

The internal transcribed spacer region (392\u00a0bp) of the rRNA gene of E. bieneusi was amplified using a nested PCR protocol. Thirty-two E. bieneusi-PCR positive samples were sequenced. A high degree of genetic polymorphism, represented by five distinct genotypes (BEB1\u2013BEB5), was found among the E. bieneusi isolates from cattle. Most of the isolates formed a distinct cluster consisting of only the four cattle genotypes, but six isolates of a genotype clustered together with E. bieneusi genotypes from humans and other domestic animals. Therefore, only some E. bieneusi isolates from cattle may be of public health importance.",

This pathogen has particular clinical significance for immunocompromised persons, including AIDS patients and cancer patients receiving toxic chemotherapeutic drug regimens. Employment of contaminated water in the production of foodstuffs may represent an important potential source of entry into food processing. This reviews aims to examine (i) the incidence of Cryptosporidium parvum in foods and waters, (ii) the association between ingesting contaminated foodstuffs and subsequent development of infection, (iii) detection methods and (iv) processing controls that may be beneficial to the food industry to help reduce or eliminate this parasite from the human foodchain. In addition, the potential of Cryptosporidium as a bioterrorist agent in the foodchain is examined.",

A high degree of genetic polymorphism was evident within assemblage E, with 11 distinct\n subtypes identified, eight of which represented new subtypes. Three subtypes were identified in assemblage A, with the subtype\n A2 transiently found in calves and cows on one farm. All farms had multiple assemblage E subtypes circulating in cattle at\n each sampling, and concurrent infection with mixed subtypes or genotypes occurred in 24% of animals. Thus, the high intensity\n of G. duodenalis transmission is not only reflected by the high prevalence of the infection but also by the high intragenotypic diversity\n and concurrent occurrence of mixed infections. The zoonotic potential of bovine G. duodenalis needs to be further studied by extensive characterization of assemblage A specimens at the subtype level.",

To estimate the prevalence and public health significance of cryptosporidiosis in post-weaned and adult dairy cattle in China, during four consecutive years (from 2006 to 2009), a total of 1315 fecal samples from 22 dairy cattle farms in ten prefectures in Henan Province were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts. The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium was 7.9%, with the highest infection rate (11.3%) in 3 to 11-month-old calves and the lowest infection rate (1.0%) in >2-year-old cows (p<0.01). Cryptosporidium-positive samples (n=104) were analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, and 25 representative samples were further analyzed by DNA sequencing of the PCR products. Cryptosporidium bovis and Cryptosporidium andersoni were identified. C. andersoni (84/104) was the predominant species and was found in all age groups, whereas C. bovis (20/104) was only detected in 3 to 11-month-old calves. Thus, C. andersoni appears to be the dominant species in weaned dairy calves and heifers in China, in contrast with its common occurrence in adult cattle in other parts of the world.",

Using nested polymerase chain reaction, 11.6% of the children were identified\n as positive for Cryptosporidium spp. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing of the PCR products showed the presence of three\n subtype families of Cryptosporidium hominis (two isolates of Ia and one isolate of Ib) and Cryptosporidium parvum (two isolates of IIc), all anthroponotic in nature. This study identified a high diversity of Cryptosporidium subtypes and clearly suggested that anthroponotic rather than zoonotic transmission played a more important role in the epidemiology\n of Cryptosporidium in the studied area.",

Phylogenetic analysis of the SSU rRNA sequences confirmed the multispecies nature of the genus Cryptosporidium, with at least four distinct species (C. parvum, C. baileyi, C. muris, and C. serpentis). Other species previously defined by biologic characteristics, including C. wrairi, C. meleagridis, and C. felis, and the desert monitor isolate, clustered together or within C. parvum. Extensive genetic diversities were present among C. parvum isolates from humans, calves, pigs, dogs, mice, ferrets, marsupials, and a monkey. In general, specific genotypes were associated with specific host species. A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique previously developed by us could differentiate most Cryptosporidium spp. and C. parvum genotypes, but sequence analysis of the PCR product was needed to differentiate C. wrairi and C. meleagridis from some of the C. parvum genotypes. These results indicate a need for revision in the taxonomy and assessment of the zoonotic potential of some animal C. parvum isolates.",

Three genotypes based on the number of GTTT repeats in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the rRNA have been described, of which genotypes I and III have been identified in humans. In this study, the genetic diversity of E. cuniculi was examined at the polar tube protein (PTP) and spore wall protein I (SWP-1) loci. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PTP gene divided 11 E. cuniculi isolates into three genotypes in congruence with the result of analysis of the ITS of the rRNA gene. The three PTP genotypes differed from one another by the copy number of the 78-bp central repeat as well as point mutations. These E. cuniculi isolates also differed from one another in the number of 15- and 36-bp repeats in the SWP-1 gene. In addition, some E. cuniculi isolates had heterogeneous copies of the SWP-1 gene with various numbers of repeats. Intragenotypic variation was also observed at the SWP-1 locus. Based on the length polymorphism and sequence diversities of the PTP and SWP-1 genes, two simple PCR tests were developed to differentiate E. cuniculi in clinical samples.",

        "abstract": "Naegleria fowleri is a climate-sensitive, thermophilic ameba found in warm, freshwater lakes and rivers. Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which is almost universally fatal, occurs when N. fowleri-containing water enters the nose, typically during swimming, and migrates to the brain via the olfactory nerve. In August 2013, a 4-year-old boy died of meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology in a Louisiana hospital.Clinical and environmental testing and a case investigation were initiated to determine the cause of death and to identify potential exposures.Based on testing of cerebrospinal fluid and brain specimens, the child was diagnosed with PAM. His only reported water exposure was tap water; in particular, tap water that was used to supply water to a lawn water slide on which the child had played extensively prior to becoming ill. Water samples were collected from both the home and the water distribution system that supplied the home and tested; N. fowleri was identified in water samples from both the home and the water distribution system.This case is the first reported PAM death associated with culturable N. fowleri in tap water from a US treated drinking water system. This case occurred in the context of an expanding geographic range for PAM beyond southern states, with recent case reports from Minnesota, Kansas, and Indiana. This case also highlights the role of adequate disinfection throughout drinking water distribution systems and the importance of maintaining vigilance when operating drinking water systems using source waters with elevated temperatures.",

The TaqMan probes were specific for the genus Cryptosporidium , but could not hybridize exclusively with human-infectious C. parvum species and genotypes. In conjunction with development of the TaqMan assays, two commercial kits, the Mo Bio UltraClean\u2122 Soil DNA kit, and the Qiagen QIAamp\u2122 DNA Stool kit, were evaluated for DNA extraction from calf diarrhea and manure, and potassium dichromate and formalin preserved human feces. Real-time quantitation was achieved with the diarrhea samples, but nested PCR was necessary to detect C. parvum DNA in manure and human feces. Ileal tissues were obtained from calves at 3, 7, and 14 days post-infection, and DNA extracted and assayed. Nested PCR detected C. parvum DNA in the 7-day post-infection sample, but neither of the other time point samples were positive. These results indicate that real-time quantitation of C. parvum DNA, extracted using the commercial kits, is feasible on diarrheic feces, with large numbers of oocysts and small concentrations of PCR inhibitor(s). For samples with few oocysts and high concentrations of PCR inhibitor(s), such as manure, nested PCR is necessary for detection.",

Oocysts are structurally indistinguishable from those of Cryptosporidium parvum. Oocysts of the new species are passed fully sporulated, lack sporocysts. and measure 4.4-5.4 microm (mean = 4.86) x 4.4-5.9 microm (mean = 5.2 microm) with a length to width ratio 1.0-1.09 (mean 1.07) (n = 100). Oocysts were not infectious for ARC Swiss mice, nude mice. Wistar rat pups, puppies, kittens or calves, but were infectious to neonatal gnotobiotic pigs. Pathogenicity studies in the gnotobiotic pig model revealed significant differences in parasite-associated lesion distribution (P = 0.005 to P = 0.02) and intensity of infection (P = 0.04) between C. parvum and this newly described species from humans. In vitro cultivation studies have also revealed growth differences between the two species. Multi-locus analysis of numerous unlinked loci, including a preliminary sequence scan of the entire genome demonstrated this species to be distinct from C. parvum and also demonstrated a lack of recombination, providing further support for its species status. Based on biological and molecular data, this Cryptosporidium infecting the intestine of humans is proposed to be a new species Cryptosporidium hominis n. sp.",

Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 291 of 779 (37.4%) animals. The prevalence rates of rotavirus, coronavirus, and Escherichia coli K99+ were lower as seen in 242 of 806 (30.0%), 46/806 (5.7%), and 16/421 (3.8%) of animals, respectively. Of the 224 Cryptosporidium-positive specimens available for molecular analysis, Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in 213 (95.1%) specimens, Cryptosporidium bovis in eight (3.6%), and Cryptosporidium deer-like genotype in three (1.3%). Sequence analysis of the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene identified 16 IIa subtypes and a new\n subtype family, with 120 of the 216 (55.6%) positive specimens having the subtype IIaA18G3R1. Eight of the IIa subtypes were\n previously seen in humans in Northern Ireland. Several subtypes were temporally or geographically unique.

        "abstract": "Mice vaccinated with whole blood-stage antigens of Plasmodium yoelii develop protective, antibody-mediated immune responses to homologous challenge infection. In this model the level of protection induced by whole parasite antigen vaccination is dependent on antibody isotype, which can be influenced by adjuvant formulations. In this study the ability adjuvant formulations to affect cytokine production and protection against P. yoelii blood-stage infection was investigated. Survival of mice in groups vaccinated with P. yoelii antigens in an aqueous mix of copolymer P1005+RaLPS was 100%. Mice vaccinated with either P. yoelii antigens alone or combined with a water-in-oil emulsion of copolymer P1005+RaLPS demonstrated 83 or 50% survival, respectively. The fully protective aqueous vaccine group produced higher levels of interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) than the water-in-oil vaccine group following a live parasite challenge infection. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with the aqueous vaccine displayed prolonged IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 response as compared to mice that received the same antigens without adjuvants. These data support the hypothesis that both the Th1 cytokine IFN\u03b3, and the Th2 cytokine IL-4 are modulated by the vaccine vehicle and adjuvant used for vaccination, thus possibly affecting expression of protective immune responses. However, it is the long-lasting IFN\u03b3 response following blood-stage P. yoelii parasite challenge that is associated with enhanced survival.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium parvum DNA from 175 neonatal calves on 16 farms in eight eastern states in the United States was subtyped by sequence analysis of\n the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene to determinate the parasite genetic diversity. Six subtypes of the IIa subtype family were found.\n Subtype IIaA15G2R1, which is the predominant C. parvum subtype in calves in many parts of the world, was identified in 77% of the C. parvum DNA from calves. Several farms had more than one C. parvum subtype and a few calves had infections with mixed subtypes. Distribution of subtypes differed geographically. Diversity\n of C. parvum in calves in eastern United States was lower than that previously seen in Michigan and southern Ontario. The high prevalence\n of one subtype in calves worldwide and frequent detection of this subtype in humans suggests that parasite fitness probably\n plays an important role in transmission of cryptosporidiosis among cattle and in zoonotic infections.",

Two Cryptosporidium isolates derived from the same bactrian camel (3-year-old) in November 2005 and April 2006 were characterized using sequence\n and phylogenetic analysis of the small-subunit rRNA (18S rRNA), 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), actin and Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) genes. The sequences of the 18S rRNA and COWP were identical to all other Cryptosporidium andersoni isolates although minor differences were noticed between the isolates and the USA isolate at the actin locus (99.2% of similarity).\n The sequence of the HSP70 was identical to the Japanese C. andersoni isolate, with a minor difference from the Australian C. andersoni isolate (99.7% of similarity). Cross-transmission studies demonstrated that the C. andersoni isolates did not infect immunosuppressed or immunocompetent Kun-ming mice, severe combined immunodeficiency mice, and immunosuppressed\n or immunocompetent calves. Among the C. andersoni isolates reported so far, only isolates from Japan could infect SCID mice. Thus, the C. andersoni isolates from the bactrian camel were biologically similar to most bovine C. andersoni isolates characterized so far, but are different from bovine isolates from Japan.",

        "abstract": "Because malaria-stimulated cytokine production may have deleterious effects on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication, the effects of Plasmodium falciparum antigens on HIV-1 replication were studied. Stimulation with malarial antigens significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication of HIV-1LAV and primary HIV-1 isolates (subtype A) in CD8-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from naive donors. The malarial antigen-induced activation of HIV-1 was due to cellular activation as judged by the expression of cell activation markers and proliferative responses. While malarial antigen stimulation increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), only monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to TNF-alpha inhibited malarial antigen-induced HIV-1 replication, whereas MAb to IL-6 had no effect. Malarial antigen increased HIV-1 replication by increasing viral mRNA expression and by activating long terminal repeat-directed viral transcription. These data suggest that P. falciparum infection can modulate HIV-1 pathogenesis by activating lymphocytes and stimulating viral replication through the production of cytokines.",

We identified them as Encephalitozoon cuniculi, type strain III (the dog genotype), based on ultrastructure, antigenic characteristics, PCR, and the sequence of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region. Encephalitozoon cuniculi is known to infect different tissues, including the urinary system and the central nervous system (CNS), of laboratory animals and cause widespread disease (2). Reports of CNS infection in immunocompetent humans thought to be caused by E. cuniculi have also been decribed for a Japanese boy (17) and a Swedish child (1) as well as for the liver (22) and peritoneum (30) of AIDS patients. Further, recent studies based on in vitro culture and molecular and antigenic characterization of several isolates (3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13-16, 18, 20, 28) have identified E. cuniculi as an agent of respiratory, uri- nary, and CNS infections in AIDS patients. We describe here the isolation, in vitro cultivation, and ultrastructural, antigenic, and molecular characterization of E. cuniculi isolated from the sputum and urine of a Spanish patient with AIDS.",

In order to resolve the controversy in the taxonomy of this parasite genus, we characterized the small-subunit rRNA genes of Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium baileyi, Cryptosporidium muris, and Cryptosporidium serpentis and performed a phylogenetic analysis of the genus Cryptosporidium. Our study revealed that the genus Cryptosporidium contains the phylogenetically distinct species C. parvum, C. muris, C. baileyi, and C. serpentis, which is consistent with the biological characteristics and host specificity data. The Cryptosporidium species formed two clades, with C. parvum and C. baileyi belonging to one clade and C. muris and C. serpentis belonging to the other clade. Within C. parvum, human genotype isolates and guinea pig isolates (known as Cryptosporidium wrairi) each differed from bovine genotype isolates by the nucleotide sequence in four regions. A C. muris isolate from cattle was also different from parasites isolated from a rock hyrax and a Bactrian camel. Minor differences were also detected between C. serpentis isolates from snakes and lizards. Based on the genetic information, a species- and strain-specific PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism diagnostic tool was developed.",

        "abstract": "The presence or absence of genetic recombination has often been used as one of the criteria for Cryptosporidium species designation and population structure delineation. During a recent study of cryptosporidiosis in reptiles that were housed in the same room, 4 lizards were found to have concurrent infections of C. serpentis (a gastric parasite) and C. saurophilum (an intestinal parasite), and 6 snakes were concurrently infected with C. serpentis, C. saurophilum and a new Cryptosporidium as indicated by PCR-RFLP analysis of the SSU rRNA gene. DNA sequence analysis of cloned PCR products confirmed the diagnosis of mixed infections. Surprisingly, it appeared that 11 of the 22 clones (8 and 14 clones from a lizard and a snake, respectively) had chimeric sequences of two Cryptosporidium spp. BootScan analysis indicated the existence of recombinants among the cloned sequences and detection of the informative sites confirmed the BootScan results. Because the probability for genetic recombination between gastric and intestinal parasites is small, these hybrid sequences were likely results of PCR artifacts due to the presence of multiple templates. This was confirmed by PCR-sequencing analysis of single-copy templates using diluted DNA samples. Direct sequencing of 69 PCR products from 100- to 1,000-fold diluted DNAs from the same snake and lizard produced only sequences of C. serpentis, C. saurophilum and the unnamed Cryptosporidium sp. Thus, care should be taken to eliminate PCR artifacts when determining the presence of genetic recombination or interpreting results of population genetic studies.",

Eighty ICR mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA, with 40 uninfected mice as controls. Half of the infected mice were treated on days 4 and 5 with aspirin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor. Infected mice started to die of cerebral malaria on day 6, and by day 17, all infected mice died. In contrast, all infected mice treated with aspirin died by day 12. Infected mice had increased phospholipase A2 mRNA expression in the spleen and cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) and COX2 expression in the brain. At the peak of cerebral malaria, infected mice had higher serum leukotriene B4 levels than control mice, and aspirin-treated infected mice had higher serum leukotriene B4 levels than untreated infected mice. These results suggest that prostaglandins are protective whereas leukotrienes are detrimental in cerebral malaria.",

        "abstract": "Contamination of the water supply by protozoa often causes outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis. The goals of the\n present study was to investigate the level of Cryptosporidium and Giardia duodenalis in wastewater from wastewater treatment plants in Harbin, China, and to understand the endemic transmission characteristics\n of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis. Forty-eight domestic wastewater specimens from the two wastewater treatment plants in\n Harbin City were collected from April 2009 to March 2010. Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis assemblages were identified by PCR and sequencing of the 18S ribosomal RNA and the triosephosphate isomerase genes, respectively.\n In total, 15 wastewater specimens were PCR positive for Cryptosporidium and 23 were PCR positive for G. duodenalis. The prevalence of contamination with G. duodenalis (47.9%) was higher than that of Cryptosporidium (31.3%). Molecular identification showed the presence of two Cryptosporidium spp. (14 belonging to Cryptosporidium andersoni and one belonging to Cryptosporidium ubiquitum) and two G. duodenalis assemblages (18 belonging to assemblage AII and six belonging to assemblage B). In addition, eight specimens contained both\n Cryptosporidium and G. duodenalis, and one specimen contained G. duodenalis assemblages AII and B. These results suggested humans might be the primary source of G. duodenalis contamination in wastewater in the studied area. In contrast, a low prevalence of C. ubiquitum suggested a reduced risk of human cryptosporidiosis caused by C. ubiquitum via waterborne route. This work provides basic experimental data needed for local wastewater treatment plants to develop\n protective strategies for water safety and to eliminate waterborne parasites.",

PCR-sequence analysis of the small subunit rRNA was used to detect and genotype Cryptosporidium spp. Cryptosporidium parvum present was further subtyped by sequence analysis of the 60\u00a0kDa glycoprotein gene. PCR-sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer gene was used to detect and genotype E. bieneusi. Altogether, two and eight of the specimens analyzed were positive for C. parvum and E. bieneusi, respectively. The former was identified as a new subtype that is genetically related to the C. hominis If subtype family, whereas the latter was identified as two related genotypes (Macaque1 and a novel genotype) in the newly assigned E. bieneusi genotype group 8.

        "abstract": "Genotyping based on sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer has revealed significant genetic diversity in Enterocytozoonbieneusi. Thus far, the population genetics of E. bieneusi and its significance in the epidemiology of microsporidiosis have not been examined. In this study, a multilocus sequence typing of E. bieneusi in AIDS patients in Lima, Peru was conducted, using 72 specimens previously genotyped as A, D, IV, EbpC, WL11, Peru7, Peru8, Peru10 and Peru11 at the internal transcribed spacer locus. Altogether, 39 multilocus genotypes were identified among the 72 specimens. The observation of strong intragenic linkage disequilibria and limited genetic recombination among markers were indicative of an overall clonal population structure of E. bieneusi. Measures of pair-wise intergenic linkage disequilibria and a standardised index of association (IAS) based on allelic profile data further supported this conclusion. Both sequence-based and allelic profile-based phylogenetic analyses showed the presence of two genetically isolated groups in the study population, one (group 1) containing isolates of the anthroponotic internal transcribed spacer genotype A, and the other (group 2) containing isolates of multiple internal transcribed spacer genotypes (mainly genotypes D and IV) with zoonotic potential. The measurement of linkage disequilibria and recombination indicated group 2 had a clonal population structure, whereas group 1 had an epidemic population structure. The formation of the two sub-populations was confirmed by STRUCTURE and Wright's fixation index (FST) analyses. The data highlight the power of MLST in understanding the epidemiology of E. bieneusi.",

ICR mice were immunized with the 19 kDa antigen, using Freund's, alum, and block copolymer P1005 in water-in-oil (W/O) or oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions with or without detoxified lipopolysaccharide (RaLPS) as adjuvants. Five weeks following immunization with the antigen, mice were boosted with asexual blood-stage antigens. Three weeks after the last immunization with the 19 kDa antigen, mice from the Freund's group and most groups that received P1005 as adjuvant had higher total IgG titres than those that received alum as adjuvant or antigen alone. Antibody responses after the antigen immunization were predominantly of the IgG1 isotype, but mice in the Freund's and P1005 (W/O or O/W emulsion with or without RaLPS) groups also had high titres of IgG2a and IgG2b. Antibody titres against merozoites increased in all groups after the parasite antigen boost. IgG2a levels in the group that received antigen in P1005 plus RaLPS in the W/O emulsion were higher than those receiving Freund's, alum or the other copolymer adjuvants. The high IgG2a titres in this group were associated with reduced IL-10 production.",

        "abstract": "A workshop titled \"Application of Genotyping Methods to Assess Pathogen Risks from Cryptosporidium in Drinking Water Catchments\" was held at the International Water Association biennial conference, Marrakech, Morocco, 23 September 2004. The workshop presented and discussed the findings of an interlaboratory trial that compared methods for genotyping Cryptosporidium oocysts isolated from feces. The primary goal of the trial and workshop was to assess the utility of current Cryptosporidium genotyping methods for determining the public health significance of oocysts isolated from feces in potable-water-supply watersheds. An expert panel of 16 watershed managers, public health practitioners, and molecular parasitologists was assembled for the workshop. A subordinate goal of the workshop was to educate watershed management and public health practitioners. An open invitation was extended to all conference delegates to attend the workshop, which drew approximately 50 interested delegates. In this report we summarize the peer consensus emerging from the workshop. Recommendations on the use of current methods by watershed managers and public health practitioners were proposed. Importantly, all the methods that were reported in the trial were mutually supporting and found to be valuable and worthy of further utility and development. Where there were choices as to which method to apply, the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene was considered to be the optimum genetic locus to target. The single-strand conformational polymorphism method was considered potentially the most valuable for discriminating to the subtype level and where a large number of samples were to be analyzed. A research agenda for protozoan geneticists was proposed to improve the utility of methods into the future. Standardization of methods and nomenclature was promoted.",

        "abstract": "The subtype IIaA15G2R1 at the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene locus is the most dominant Cryptosporidium parvum infecting dairy cattle and humans in industrialised nations. The reasons for its high transmissibility are not clear, and it remains to be determined whether this subtype represents a homogeneous parasite population. In this study, we sequence-characterised 26 IIaA15G2R subtype specimens and 26 non-IIaA15G2R subtype specimens from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Spain at seven other known polymorphic loci, including CP47, CP56, DZ-HRGP, MSC6-5, MSC6-7, RPGR and ZPT. Extensive heterogeneity within IIaA15G2R1 and discordance in typing results between gp60 and other genetic markers were observed. Results of inter-locus and intra-ZPT linkage disequilibrium and recombination analyses indicated that the heterogeneity within IIaA15G2R1 and discordance in typing results among genetic loci were largely due to the occurrence of genetic recombination, mostly within the gp60 subtype IIaA15G2R1. Although there was no clear population diversion between IIaA15G2R and non-IIaA15G2R subtypes, results of STRUCTURE and FST analyses suggested the presence of at least two subpopulations; subpopulation 1 had an epidemic population structure and was widely distributed, whereas subpopulation 2 had a clonal population structure and consisted of geographically segregated multilocus subtypes. Genetic recombination between epidemic and geographically segregated C. parvum populations appeared to be a driving force in the emergence of a hyper-transmissible IIaA15G2R1 subtype. Genetic recombination was observed even between the zoonotic IIa subtype family and anthroponotic subtype family IIc at CP56, MSC6-7 and ZPT. Thus, the IIaA15G2R1 subtype at gp60 is likely a fitness marker for C. parvum and the wide spread of IIaA15G2R1 subtype around the world is probably independent of the sequence characteristics at other genetic loci.",

Fourteen subtypes within nine subtype families were identified, and three of the subtype families (If, IIb, and IId) were restricted or largely limited to Portugal. Parasites from cattle from various regions in Portugal and wild ruminants in Lisbon showed limited genetic heterogeneity (only two subtype families). All wild ruminants had the same subtype, which was also the predominant subtype in cattle all over Portugal and was found in nine HIV-infected patients in Lisbon. Two other C. parvum subtypes were only restricted to limited locations. In contrast, human parasites displayed 13 subtypes in nine subtype families, with most of the infections caused by parasites in Ib, IIa, IIc, and IId families. Two of the C. parvum subtype families (IIc and IIb) had only been found in humans. The high overall parasite diversity and high percentage of C. hominis infections attributable to Ib and C. parvum infections to IId represent unique characteristics of Cryptosporidium transmission in humans in Portugal.",

        "abstract": "Thus far, genotyping of Enterocytozoon bieneusi has been based solely on DNA sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the rRNA gene. Both host-adapted and zoonotic (human-pathogenic) genotypes of E. bieneusi have been identified. In this study, we searched for microsatellite and minisatellite sequences in the whole-genome sequence database of E. bieneusi isolate H348. Seven potential targets (MS1 to MS7) were identified. Testing of the seven targets by PCR using two human-pathogenic E. bieneusi genotypes (A and Peru10) led to the selection of four targets (MS1, MS3, MS4, and MS7). Further analysis of the four loci with an additional 24 specimens of both host-adapted and zoonotic E. bieneusi genotypes indicated that most host-adapted genotypes were not amplified by PCR targeting these loci. In contrast, 10 or 11 of the 13 specimens of the zoonotic genotypes were amplified by PCR at each locus. Altogether, 12, 8, 7, and 11 genotypes of were identified at MS1, MS3, MS4, and MS7, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences obtained produced a genetic relationship that was similar to the one at the ITS locus, with the formation of a large group of zoonotic genotypes that included most E. bieneusi genotypes in humans. Thus, a multilocus sequence typing tool was developed for high-resolution genotyping of E. bieneusi. Data obtained in the study should also have implications for understanding the taxonomy of Enterocytozoon spp., the public health significance of E. bieneusi in animals, and the sources of human E. bieneusi infections.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism for the maintenance of Cryptosporidium infection in sheep between yearly lambing periods is not clear. Previously, periparturient shedding of oocysts as the result of stress from lambing was suspected to be a mechanism for the initiation of Cryptosporidium infection in lambs, but this has never been verified by genotyping studies. In this study, fecal specimens from four age groups of sheep in Inner Mongolia, China were examined for Cryptosporidium spp. by PCR-restricted fragment length polymorphism and sequence analyses of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, including 59 ewes 1 week before parturition, 154 ewes at parturition, 87 lambs of 3-4 weeks, and 75 lambs of 15-16 weeks. The Cryptosporidium infection rate in ewes at parturition (7.8%) was significantly higher than at 1 week before parturition (1.7%). Higher infection rates were found in lambs (18.4% and 26.7% for 3-4-week-old and 15-16-week-old lambs, respectively). Most (10/13) Cryptosporidium-positive ewes were shedding Cryptosporidium xiaoi, which was also the dominant species (15/16) in neonatal lambs of 3-4 weeks in age (15/16). The less common species in ewes, Cryptosporidium ubiquitum, was not found in lambs of 3-4 weeks but was the dominant species (14/20) in lambs of 15-16 weeks. The major zoonotic Cryptosporidium species, C. parvum (of the IIaA15G2R1 subtype), was only found in one lamb. These data support the occurrence of periparturient transmission of Cryptosporidium spp., especially C. xiaoi, from ewes to lambs.",

Faecal examinations of 222 horses of different age groups revealed Cryptosporidium infection rates of 15-31% in 66 foals surveyed in central Ohio, southern Ohio and central Kentucky, USA. Only 1 of 39 weanlings, 0 of 46 yearlings, and 0 of 71 mares were positive. Giardia infection was found in all age groups, although the infection rates for foals were higher (17-35%). Chronological study of infection in 35 foals showed that foals started to excrete Cryptosporidium oocysts between 4 and 19 weeks and Giardia cysts between 2 and 22 weeks of age. The cumulative infection rates of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in foals were each 71%. Some foals were concurrently infected with both parasites and excretion of oocysts or cysts was intermittent and long-lasting. The longest duration of excretion was 14 weeks for Cryptosporidium and 16 weeks for Giardia. Excretion of Cryptosporidium oocysts stopped before weaning, while excretion of Giardia cysts continued thereafter. Infected foals were considered the major source of Cryptosporidium infection in foals, whereas infected mares were deemed the major source of Giardia infection in foals. The high infection rate of Giardia in nursing mares suggested a periparturient relaxation of immunity. The results indicated that Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections are common in horses.",

In addition, recent reports have described the parasite as an etiologic agent of cryptosporidiosis in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised humans. Therefore, it is important to genetically characterize isolates of C. meleagridis from different hosts and geographic areas, and to develop molecular tools to differentiate isolates from various hosts or areas. In this study, a total of 11 isolates of Cryptosporidium meleagridis from both human and avian hosts were examined at three genetic loci: the small-subunit rRNA, 60-kDa glycoprotein precursor, and 70-kDa heat shock protein genes. Two genotypes of C. meleagridis were seen at the small-subunit rRNA locus. These differed from each other by the presence or lack of a heterogeneous copy of the gene and an ATT repeat. The 60-kDa glycoprotein precursor gene divided these eleven isolates of C. meleagridis into six genotypes with high sequence diversity between groups. The highest genetic heterogeneity, however, was seen at the 70-kDa heat shock protein locus, and was primarily present at the 3' end of the gene. This heterogeneity separated eight isolates of C. meleagridis into six genotypes. These data could be useful in the development of molecular tools to promote understanding of the transmission of C. meleagridis in humans.",

Studies in which genotyping of Cryptospiridium oocysts in feces of dogs and cats have been successful and have demonstrated that most infections in these animals are caused by host-specific C. canis and C. felis, respectively. Most human cases of cryptosporidiosis are associated with C. hominis and C. parvum; C. canis and C. felis are responsible for only a small number of cases. Thus, molecular epidemiologic studies support the contention that the risk of zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. from pet cats and dogs is low. Veterinarians can inform their clients of this minimal risk, but nevertheless advise them to minimize contact with pet cat and dog feces.",

We observed that INS20-19 is likely a protein with high expression in the apical region of sporozoites, and neutralization of the protein led to a partial reduction of parasite load in HCT-8 and MDBK cell cultures at 24\u00a0h.

        "abstract": "Genotyping studies on the source and human infection potential of Cryptosporidium oocysts in water have been almost exclusively conducted in industrialized nations. In this study, 50 source water samples and 30 tap water samples were collected in Shanghai, China, and analyzed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1623. To find a cost-effective method to replace the filtration procedure, the water samples were also concentrated by calcium carbonate flocculation (CCF). Of the 50 source water samples, 32% were positive for Cryptosporidium and 18% for Giardia by Method 1623, whereas 22% were positive for Cryptosporidium and 10% for Giardia by microscopy of CCF concentrates. When CCF was combined with PCR for detection, the occurrence of Cryptosporidium (28%) was similar to that obtained by Method 1623. Genotyping of Cryptosporidium in 17 water samples identified the presence of C. andersoni in 14 water samples, C. suis in 7 water samples, C. baileyi in 2 water samples, C. meleagridis in 1 water sample, and C. hominis in 1 water sample. Therefore, farm animals, especially cattle and pigs, were the major sources of water contamination in Shanghai source water, and most oocysts found in source water in the area were not infectious to humans. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in 2 of 30 tap water samples. The combined use of CCF for concentration and PCR for detection and genotyping provides a less expensive alternative to filtration and fluorescence microscopy for accurate assessment of Cryptosporidium contamination in water, although the results from this method are semiquantitative.",

In contrast, C. parvum, C. meleagridis, C. canis, and C. felis were associated with diarrhea only. C. hominis subtype families were identifi ed (Ia, Ib, Id, and Ie); all were asso- ciated with diarrhea. Ib was also associated with nausea, vomiting, and general malaise. All C. parvum specimens belonged to subtype family IIc. Analysis of risk factors did not show associations with specifi c Cryptosporidium spp. genotypes or subtypes.

        "abstract": "Few studies have been conducted on the distribution of Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in equine animals. In this study, 878 stool specimens were collected during 2015-2019 from 551 donkeys and 327 horses in Shandong, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, China and screened for Cryptosporidium spp. by PCR analysis of the small subunit rRNA gene. The Cryptosporidium species presented were identified by sequence analysis of the PCR products and subtyped by sequence analysis of the 60\u202fkDa glycoprotein gene. The infection rates of Cryptosporidium spp. in horses and donkeys were 3.1% (10/327) and 14.5% (80/551), respectively. Four Cryptosporidium species/genotypes were identified, including C. parvum (in 5 horses), C. hominis (in 75 donkeys), Cryptosporidium horse genotype (in 5 horses and 4 donkeys) and a new genotype that is genetically related to Cryptosporidium mink genotype (in 1 donkey). All C. parvum isolates were subtyped as IIdA19G1, C. hominis as IkA16G1, and horse genotype as VIaA15G4. Data from this study indicate that four Cryptosporidium species are circulating in horses and donkeys in the study areas, with C. hominis as a dominant Cryptosporidium species in only donkeys. Attention should be paid to reduce the transmission of these zoonotic Cryptosporidium spp.",

        "abstract": "To assess the source and public health significance of Cryptosporidium oocyst contamination in storm runoff, a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique based on the small-subunit rRNA gene was used in the analysis of 94 storm water samples collected from the Malcolm Brook and N5 stream basins in New York over a 3-year period. The distribution of Cryptosporidium in this study was compared with the data obtained from 27 storm water samples from the Ashokan Brook in a previous study. These three watersheds represented different levels of human activity. Among the total of 121 samples analyzed from the three watersheds, 107 were PCR positive, 101 of which (94.4%) were linked to animal sources. In addition, C. hominis (W14) was detected in six samples collected from the Malcolm Brook over a 2-week period. Altogether, 22 Cryptosporidium species or genotypes were found in storm water samples from these three watersheds, only 11 of which could be attributed to known species/groups of animals. Several Cryptosporidium spp. were commonly found in these three watersheds, including the W1 genotype from an unknown animal source, the W4 genotype from deer, and the W7 genotype from muskrats. Some genotypes were found only in a particular watershed. Aliquots of 113 samples were also analyzed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1623; 63 samples (55.7%) were positive for Cryptosporidium by microscopy, and 39 (78%) of the 50 microscopy-negative samples were positive by PCR. Results of this study demonstrate that molecular techniques can complement traditional detection methods by providing information on the source of contamination and the human-infective potential of Cryptosporidium oocysts found in water.",

        "abstract": "Over 13 months, 465 beavers, foxes, muskrats, otters, and raccoons were trapped in four counties in eastern Maryland and examined by molecular methods for microsporidia. A two-step nested PCR protocol was developed to amplify a 392-bp fragment of the internal transcribed spacer region of the rRNA gene of Enterocytozoon spp., with the use of primers complementary to the conserved regions of published nucleotide sequences. Fifty-nine PCR-positive samples were sequenced. Multiple alignments of these sequences identified 17 genotypes of Enterocytozoon spp. (WL1 to WL17); of these, 15 have not been reported before. Most of the genotypes were found in multiple species of wildlife and belonged to a major group consisting of all the previously described Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes from human and domestic animals. Some of the isolates from muskrats and raccoons formed two distinct groups. Results of this study indicate that fur-bearing mammals, especially those closely associated with surface water, can be a potential source of human-patho- genic E. bieneusi. However, there are also host-adapted Enterocytozoon genotypes in wildlife, which may represent species different from E. bieneusi and have no apparent public health significance. This is the first report of E. bieneusi in wildlife.",

Investigation of the animal contacts of affected individuals led to the formulation of the hypothesis that animals are a source of cryptosporidiosis. The research was done in the Region of Ljubljana, an area with 587,000 inhabitants during a period of three years. Stool specimens of 338 persons with acute enteric diseases were positive for Cryptosporidium sp. Diagnosis was done with an immunofluorescence test and modified Ziel-Neelsen staining. Processing of statistical data was done with the medical software application EPI INFO 6. According to our questionnaire, direct contact with animals occurred in 49 of the 338 cases of cryptosporidiosis, and was more frequently registered in males (Odds ratio = 1.96). Subgenotyping analysis revealed the presence of two subgenotypes of Cryptosporidium parvum bovine (GPB and GPC) in humans. These data indicate that genetic heterogeneity in C. parvum bovine genotype exists in a localized area and that farm animals can be a source of infection.",

Four distinct Cryptosporidium genotypes were identified: (i) the Cryptosporidium parvum \"human\" genotype, (ii) the C. parvum \"cattle\" genotype, (iii) Cryptosporidium felis, and (iv) Cryptosporidium meleagridis. This is the first report of C. meleagridis in a human host. These results and those of others indicate that immunocompromised individuals are susceptible to a wide range of Cryptosporidium species and genotypes. Future studies are required to understand the full public health significance of Cryptosporidium genotypes and species in immunocompromised hosts.",

Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PTP gene divided 24 E. hellem isolates into four genotypes, compared to two genotypes identified by analysis of the internal transcribed spacer of the rRNA gene. The four PTP genotypes differed from each other by the copy number of the 60-bp central repeat as well as by point mutations. A simple PCR test was developed to differentiate E. hellem genotypes based on the difference in the size of PTP PCR products, which should facilitate the genotyping of E. hellem in clinical samples.",

Thus, it is important to differentiate N. fowleri from the rest in the genus of Naegleria, and to develop tools for the detection of intra-specific genetic variations. In this study, one isolate each of N. australiensis, N. gruberi, N. jadini, and N. lovaniensis and 22 isolates of N. fowleri were characterized at the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and mitochondrial small subunit rRNA (mtSSU rRNA) gene. The mtSSU rRNA primers designed amplified DNA of all isolates, with distinct sequences obtained from all species examined. In contrast, the ITS primers only amplified DNA from N. lovaniensis and N. fowleri, with minor sequence differences between the two. Three genotypes of N. fowleri were found among the isolates analyzed in both the mtSSU rRNA gene and ITS. The extent of sequence variation was greater in the mtSSU rRNA gene, but the ITS had the advantage of length polymorphism. These data should be useful in the development of molecular tools for rapid species differentiation and genotyping of Naegleria spp.",

The results of these studies have firmly established giardiasis as a zoonotic disease, although host adaptation at the genotype and subtype levels has reduced the likelihood of zoonotic transmission. These studies have also identified variations in the distribution of Giardia duodenalis genotypes among geographic areas and between domestic and wild ruminants and differences in clinical manifestations and outbreak potentials of assemblages A and B. Nevertheless, our efforts in characterizing the molecular epidemiology of giardiasis and the roles of various animals in the transmission of human giardiasis are compromised by the lack of case-control and longitudinal cohort studies and the sampling and testing of humans and animals living in the same community, the frequent occurrence of infections with mixed genotypes and subtypes, and the apparent heterozygosity at some genetic loci for some G. duodenalis genotypes. With the increased usage of multilocus genotyping tools, the development of next-generation subtyping tools, the integration of molecular analysis in epidemiological studies, and an improved understanding of the population genetics of G. duodenalis in humans and animals, we should soon have a better appreciation of the molecular epidemiology of giardiasis, the disease burden of zoonotic transmission, the taxonomy status and virulences of various G. duodenalis genotypes, and the ecology of environmental contamination.",

We genotyped Cryptosporidium in 132 stool specimens from 80 Peruvian children, representing 85 infection episodes, using techniques that differentiate Cryptosporidium species and C. parvum genotypes. Five types of Cryptosporidium were identified: C. parvum human (67), bovine (8), and dog (2) genotypes, C. meleagridis (7), and C. felis (1). Twenty-five (29%) of the 85 infection episodes were associated with diarrhea. There was no significant difference in age, antecedent stunting, percentage with diarrhea, or duration of diarrhea for episodes with human genotype, compared with those of zoonotic Cryptosporidium. Duration of oocyst shedding was longer for human genotype than for zoonotic Cryptosporidium (mean, 13.9 days and 6.4 days, respectively; P=.004). Serum samples from 8 children with C. meleagridis, C. felis, or C. parvum dog genotype were tested for anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 antibodies; all were found to be negative.

        "abstract": "Over 200 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have been reported, but little is known if other enteric pathogens were also involved in some of these outbreaks. Recently, an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis linked to poor hygiene by two Cryptosporidium hominis subtypes occurred in a pediatric hospital ward (Ward A) in China, lasting for more than 14 months. In this study, the concurrence during the outbreak of three other enteric pathogens with a similar transmission route, Giardia duodenalis, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Clostridium difficile, was assessed.The occurrence of G. duodenalis, E. bieneusi, and C. difficile in 78 inpatients from Ward A and 283 and 216 inpatients from two control wards (Wards C and D) in the same hospital was examined using molecular diagnostic tools. Significantly higher infection rates were found in children in Ward A for all study pathogens than in Wards C and D (P<0.01): 9.5% versus 1.4% and 0% for G. duodenalis, 10.8% versus 2.8% and 3.7% for E. bieneusi, and 60.8% versus 37.8% and 27.8% for C. difficile, respectively. These differences were mostly seen in children \u2264 12 months. Enteric pathogen-positive children in Ward A (31/58 or 53.4%) were more likely to have mixed infections than those in Ward C (4/119 or 3.4%) or D (5/68, 7.4%; P<0.01). Having cryptosporidiosis was a risk factor for G. duodenalis (OR = 4.3; P = 0.08), E. bieneusi (OR = 3.1; P = 0.04), and C. difficile (OR = 4.7; P<0.01) infection. In addition, a lower diversity of G. duodenalis, E. bieneusi, and C. difficile genotypes/subtypes was observed in Ward A.Data from this study suggest that multiple pathogens were concurrently present during the previous cryptosporidiosis outbreak. Examination of multiple enteric pathogens should be conducted when poor hygiene is the likely cause of outbreaks of diarrhea.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. was investigated in scale quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) farms in Henan Province, China between September 2006 and August 2007. One thousand eight hundred and eighteen fecal samples from 47 quail farms in five areas were collected for the examination of Cryptosporidium oocysts. The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium was 13.1% (95% CI 13.1\u00b11.6%) (29 of 47 farms), with 72-100-day-old quails having the highest prevalence (23.6%, 95% CI 23.6\u00b12.6%) (\u03c7(2)=64.91; \u03c1<0.01). The highest prevalence was observed in autumn (21.8%, 95% CI 21.8\u00b13.1%) and the lowest in winter (\u03c7(2)=74.83; \u03c1<0.01). Two hundred and thirty-nine Cryptosporidium-positive samples were analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, and 42 were further analyzed by DNA sequencing of the PCR products. Two Cryptosporidium species were identified, Cryptosporidium baileyi in 237 birds on 29 farms, and potentially zoonotic Cryptosporidium meleagridis in only two birds on two farms. These findings may suggest that quails are not a major source of zoonotic Cryptosporidium in the study area.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis is a significant cause of food-borne and waterborne outbreaks of diarrheal diseases. To better understand the route of transmission of Cryptosporidium parasites, a number of genotyping techniques have been developed, based on PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism or sequencing analysis of antigen, structural, and housekeeping genes. In this study, a real-time assay for the detection of Cryptospo- ridium oocysts is described. This technique had a detection limit of five oocysts. By melting curve analysis of PCR products with fluorescence-labeled hybridization probes, this technique was able to differentiate five common Cryptosporidium parasites that are pathogenic for humans in a single PCR. We evaluated and validated the test using samples from presently known Cryptosporidium parasites that are pathogenic for humans. This technique provides an alternative molecular tool in epidemiologic studies of human cryptosporidiosis. oocysts were used in DNA extraction, with the exception of one C. parvum bovine genotype isolate (isolate 6), for which oocysts purified by sucrose-Percoll centrifugation were used in DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from oocysts or stool samples by alkaline digestion (100 l of stool pellets in 33.3 lo f 1MK OH and 9.3 l of 1 M dithiothreitol at 65\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by neutralization with 4.3 l of 25% HCl and 80 l of 2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.3), phenol-chloroform- isoamyl alcohol extraction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), and DNA purification using a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). Real-time PCR. The most polymorphic region of the SSU rRNA gene (820 bp) was amplified from samples by PCR carried out in a LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Ind.), using Cryptosporidium-specific for- ward primer 5-GGAAGGGTTGTATTTATTAGATAAAG-3 and reverse primer 5-AAGGAGTAAGGAACAACCTCCA-3 (29, 30). The PCR mixture contained 2 l of Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, Conn.) 10 buffer, 4 mM MgCl2, 100 M (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 400 nM forward and reverse primers, 200 nM (each) hybridization probes (probe 1, 5-CCGTCTAAAGCTGATAG GTCAGAAACTTGAATG-flourescein-3; probe 2, 5-LCred705-GTCACATT AATTGTGATCCGTAAAG-3), 0.5 l of nonacetylated bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml), 1 U of Taq polymerase, and 1 l of DNA template in a total of 20 l. Probe 1 was based on the sequence that is conserved among all Cryptospo- ridium parasites, whereas probe 2 was a sequence of the C. parvum human genotype and was designed to hybridize to all intestinal Cryptosporidium para- sites with various extents of mismatches.",

        "abstract": "There has been an explosion of descriptions of new species of Cryptosporidium during the last two decades. This has been accompanied by confusion regarding the criteria for species designation, largely because of the lack of distinct morphologic differences and strict host specificity among Cryptosporidium spp. A review of the biologic species concept, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), and current practices for Cryptosporidium species designation calls for the establishment of guidelines for naming Cryptosporidium species. All reports of new Cryptosporidium species should include at least four basic components: oocyst morphology, natural host specificity, genetic characterizations, and compliance with the ICZN. Altogether, 13 Cryptosporidium spp. are currently recognized: C. muris, C. andersoni, C. parvum, C. hominis, C. wrairi, C. felis, and C. cannis in mammals; C. ba\u00efleyi, C. meleagridis, and C. galli in birds; C. serpentis and C. saurophilum in reptiles; and C. molnari in fish. With the establishment of a framework for naming Cryptosporidium species and the availability of new taxonomic tools, there should be less confusion associated with the taxonomy of the genus Cryptosporidium. The clarification of Cryptosporidium taxonomy is also useful for understanding the biology of Cryptosporidium spp., assessing the public health significance of Cryptosporidium spp. in animals and the environment, characterizing transmission dynamics, and tracking infection and contamination sources.",

This study compared the effectiveness of six DNA extraction methods (DNA extraction with the QIAamp DNA minikit after oocyst purification with immunomagnetic separation and direct DNA extraction methods using the FastDNA SPIN kit for soil, QIAamp DNA stool minikit, UltraClean soil kit, or QIAamp DNA minikit and the traditional phenol-chloroform technique) for the detection of Cryptosporidium with oocyst-seeded samples, DNA-spiked samples, and field water samples. The study also evaluated the effects of different PCR facilitators (nonacetylated bovine serum albumin, the T4 gene 32 protein, and polyvinylpyrrolidone) and treatments (the use of GeneReleaser or ultrafiltration) for the relief from or removal of inhibitors of PCR amplification. The results of seeding and spiking studies showed that PCR inhibitors were presented in all DNA solutions extracted by the six methods. However, the effect of PCR inhibitors could be relieved significantly by the addition of 400 ng of bovine serum albumin/mul or 25 ng of T4 gene 32 protein/mul to the PCR mixture. With the inclusion of bovine serum albumin in the PCR mixture, DNA extracted with the FastDNA SPIN kit for soil without oocyst isolation resulted in PCR performance similar to that produced by the QIAamp DNA minikit after oocysts were purified by immunomagnetic separation.",

        "abstract": "Merozoite surface protein 1 is a candidate for blood-stage vaccines against malaria parasites. We report here an immunization study of Saimiri monkeys with a yeast-expressed recombinant protein containing the C terminus of Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1 and two T-helper epitopes of tetanus toxin (yP2P30Pv20019), formulated in aluminum hydroxide (alum) and block copolymer P1005. Monkeys immunized three times with yP2P30Pv20019 in block copolymer P1005 had significantly higher prechallenge titers of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the immunogen and asexual blood-stage parasites than those immunized with yP2P30Pv20019 in alum, antigen alone, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (P < 0.05). Their peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferative responses to immunogen stimulation 4 weeks after the second immunization were also significantly higher than those from the PBS control group (P < 0.05). Upon challenge with 100,000 asexual blood-stage parasites 5 weeks after the last immunization, monkeys immunized with yP2P30Pv20019 in block copolymer P1005 had prepatent periods longer than those for the control alone group (P > 0.05). Three of the five animals in this group also had low parasitemia (peak parasitemia, </=20 parasites/microliter of blood). Partially protected monkeys had significantly higher levels of prechallenge antibodies against the immunogen than those unprotected (P < 0.05). There was also a positive correlation between the prepatent period and titers of IgG antibodies against the immunogen and asexual blood-stage parasites and a negative correlation between accumulated parasitemia and titers of IgG antibodies against the immunogen (P < 0.05). These results indicate that when combined with block copolymer and potent T-helper epitopes, the yeast-expressed P2P30Pv20019 recombinant protein may offer some protection against malaria.",

        "title": "Molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium spp. in native breeds of cattle in Kaduna State, Nigeria",
        "abstract": "Despite numerous molecular epidemiologic studies of cryptosporidiosis in dairy cattle in industrialized countries, there are very few studies on the diversity and public health significance of Cryptosporidium species in native cattle in developing countries. In this study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene was used to detect and identify Cryptosporidium spp. in 194 fecal specimens from 2 to 365 days old calves in 20 White Fulani and Sokoto Gudali herds in Nigeria. Thirty one (16.0%) of the specimens were positive for Cryptosporidium . Restriction digestion of the PCR products showed the presence of Cryptosporidium bovis (7.2%), Cryptosporidium ryanae (4.1%), Cryptosporidium andersoni (2.5%), and concurrent occurrence of C. bovis and C. ryanae (1.5%), and C. bovis and C. andersoni (0.5%). There were no significant differences ( p > 0.05) in Cryptosporidium infection rates by sex, herd location, management system, breed of calves, or fecal consistency. However, calves 180 days or younger had a higher infection rate of Cryptosporidium than older calves ( p = 0.034). Likewise, younger calves also had higher occurrence of C. bovis and C. ryanae ( p = 0.022). The absence of zoonotic Cryptosporidium parvum in the calves studied suggests that native breeds of cattle may not be important in the transmission of human cryptosporidiosis in Kaduna State, Nigeria. Keywords Cryptosporidium Molecular epidemiology Cattle Nigeria Zoonosis 1 Introduction Cryptosporidium spp. are common parasites of humans, domestic animals, and wild vertebrates ( Xiao and Feng, 2008 ). Cryptosporidiosis is an important cause of diarrhea in young farm animals such as calves, lambs, piglets, and goat kids ( Santin and Trout, 2008 ). Some livestock, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, harbor Cryptosporidium species that are infectious for humans. Thus, cryptosporidiosis is considered a zoonotic disease and cattle have been considered to be an important source of zoonotic cryptosporidiosis since the 1980s ( Xiao and Feng, 2008 ). Contact with infected calves has been implicated as the cause of many small cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in veterinary students, research technicians, and children attending agricultural camps and fairs ( Smith et al., 2004; Kiang et al., 2006 ). The use of molecular diagnostic techniques in the characterization of Cryptosporidium spp. has led to increased recognition of the diversity of parasites infecting humans and animals and role of animals in the transmission of human cryptosporidiosis ( Xiao et al., 2004 ). Studies of cryptosporidiosis in dairy cattle have identified several Cryptosporidium species in cattle ( Santin and Trout, 2008 ). Although dairy cattle have been considered to be a major host for Cryptosporidium parvum , only pre-weaned calves are frequently infected with this species ( Santin and Trout, 2008 ). Most Cryptosporidium infections in post-weaned calves are caused by Cryptosporidium bovis and Cryptosporidium ryanae , which can also be found in yearlings and adult cattle. Cryptosporidium andersoni is first found in juveniles but more frequently in yearlings and adults ( Sant\u0131n et al., 2004; Fayer et al., 2007; Langkjaer et al., 2007 ). Occasional cases of Cryptosporidium felis ( Bornay-Llinares et al., 1999 ), Cryptosporidium suis (Fayer et al., 2006; Geurden et al., 2006 ), Cryptosporidium hominis ( Smith et al., 2005 ), Cryptosporidium pig genotype II ( Langkjaer et al., 2007 ), and a C. suis -like genotype ( Langkjaer et al., 2007 ) were reported in cattle in the United States, Denmark, Poland Scotland, and Zambia. Thus far, most molecular characterizations of Cryptosporidium spp. in cattle are done with dairy breeds in industrialized countries (for example, Sant\u0131n et al., 2004; Starkey et al., 2006; Coklin et al., 2007; Fayer et al., 2007; Geurden et al., 2006, 2007; Feng et al., 2007; Langkjaer et al., 2007 ). There are only a few studies on the characterizations of Cryptosporidium spp. in beef cattle in industrialized nations ( Moriarty et al., 2005; Feltus et al., 2008; Fayer et al., 2010; Ralston et al., 2010; Dixon et al., 2011 ) and in dairy cattle in developing countries ( Geurden et al., 2006; Bakheit et al., 2008; Halim et al., 2008; Nuchjangreed et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Amer et al., 2010; Inpankaew et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2010; Muhid et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011 ). At the time of the execution of this study, there was only one study on genetic identity of Cryptosporidium spp. on small traditional husbandry cattle farms in Zambia ( Geurden et al., 2006 ). In Nigeria, most studies on cryptosporidiosis in animals were based on microscopy of oocysts in feces ( Ayeni et al., 1985; Kwaga et al., 1988; Maikai et al., 2009 ), and the identity of the parasites involved was not clear. However, a recent small-scale study involving PCR-RFLP analysis of fecal specimens from 12 to 24-week-old diarrheic calves in four White Fulani herds in southwestern Nigeria has been published ( Ayinmode et al., 2010 ). The present study was aimed at studying the distribution and public health significance of Cryptosporidium spp. in local breeds of calves of all ages in Kaduna State, Nigeria. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area Kaduna State (11\u00b010\u2032N, 7\u00b038\u2032E) is located within the Northern Guinea Savannah Zone of Nigeria. The state occupies an area of approximately 48,473 km 2 and according to the 2006 census, has an estimated population of 6,066,562 people ( http://Kadunastate.gov.ng/kad.html ). Six Local Government Areas (LGA) were selected using stratified and simple random sampling methods from the three senatorial districts based on the number of established cattle farms as submitted to the State Ministry of Agriculture. They included Kaduna North, Kaduna South, Zaria, Chikun, Lere, and Jema\u2019a. 2.2 Sample collection Approximately 10 g of fecal specimens were collected during July 2008 and April 2009 from the rectum of 194 randomly selected 2\u2013365 days old calves with or without diarrhea in 20 herds of White Fulani, Sokoto Gudali and their crosses. The two represent locally important breeds of cattle in Nigeria. Although both are Zebu type cattle and used for milk and meat, White Fulani cattle are drought tolerant and found throughout the area of the Fulani people in West Africa, whereas Sokoto Gudali cattle are heat tolerant and more restricted to northern Nigeria, Benin, Ghana and Mali ( Tawah and Rege, 1996 ). Questionnaires were administered to animal owners to collect data on each selected animal. The data on risk factors included age, sex, breed, housing (intensive/extensive), number of animals on each farm, source of drinking water, presence of diarrhea, and history of illness. Specimens were stored at 4 \u00b0C in 2.5% potassium dichromate prior to DNA extraction. 2.3 DNA extraction DNA was extracted from fecal specimens after they were washed off potassium dichromate with distilled water by centrifugation. The FastDNA SPIN kit for soil (BIO 101, Carlsbad, CA) was used in DNA extraction ( Feng et al., 2007 ). 2.4 Cryptosporidium detection by PCR Cryptosporidium in DNA of fecal specimens was detected by nested PCR targeting an approximately 830-bp region of the small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene ( Feng et al., 2007 ). Each specimen was analyzed at least twice using DNA of Cryptosporidium baileyi as the positive control. The PCR products were visualized in 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis after ethidium bromide staining. 2.5 Identification of Cryptosporidium species by RFLP Cryptosporidium species in positive specimens were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the secondary PCR products with the enzymes Ssp I and Mbo II. The digestion products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the banding patterns obtained were used in the differentiation of the four common Cryptosporidium species in cattle ( Feng et al., 2007 ). 2.6 Sequence analysis Representative secondary PCR products (four each from C. bovis and C. andersoni and one from C. ryanae ) of the SSU rRNA gene were sequenced in both directions to confirm the Cryptosporidium species diagnosis, after they were purified using the Multiscreen PCR Plate (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The sequencing reaction was performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 CycleSequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After being cleaned with the Centrisep spin columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ), the sequencing reactions were read on an ABI Prism \u00ae 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The sequences obtained were aligned with each other and published SSU rRNA gene sequences of Cryptosporidium species using the software ClustalX ( ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-trasbg.fr/pub/ClustalX/ ). 2.7 Data analysis Associations between various risk factors and the occurrence of Cryptosporidium infection were analyzed using the chi-square test in the EpiInfo (version 3.5.1, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA). 3 Results 3.1 Occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. Among the 194 fecal specimens examined, 31(16.0%) produced the expected SSU rRNA PCR product of approximately 830-bp. Chikun had the highest infection rate (26.5%) of Cryptosporidium spp., followed by Kaduna South (22.2%), Zaria (20.0%), Lere (18.2%), Jema\u2019a (9.7%), and Kaduna North (2.5%). Nevertheless, the difference in the infection rate of Cryptosporidium was only marginally significant ( p = 0.053) ( Table 1 ). 3.2 Risk factors for cryptosporidiosis There was an age-associated difference in the occurrence of Cryptosporidium infections. Calves of three months or younger had the highest infection rate of cryptosporidiosis (25.7%), followed by those of 3\u20136 months (18.3%), 7\u20139 months (12.5%), and 10\u201312 months (3.4%). The age-associated difference in Cryptosporidium infection rates reached significance ( p = 0.034) between calves of \u22646 months (20.5%) and older calves (9.1%) ( Table 2 ). There was a higher infection rate of Cryptosporidium in males (16.7%) than females (15.5%), but the difference was not significant ( p = 0.82) ( Table 3 ). Likewise, although the infection rate of Cryptosporidium in the Sokoto Gudalis breed (20.0%) was higher than that of the White Fulanis (17.5%) or their crosses (7.7%), the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.27) ( Table 3 ). The management systems practiced at the different locations were intensive (cattle with restricted movements within the farm/property only), semi-intensive (cattle confined within the farm but were allowed to graze outside the farm occasionally), or extensive (cattle grazing in the open field without restricted movements). There was no significant difference in infection rates of Cryptosporidium between cattle raised under semi-intensive system (17.6%) and those raised under extensive system of management (15.8%) ( p = 0.797). Very few cattle in the study were raised under the intensive management system ( Table 3 ). A slightly higher infection rate (25.0%) of Cryptosporidium was seen in diarrheic cattle compared to those with well formed (17.5%), and loose (14.0%) feces. However, there were only four animals sampled in the diarrhea group, and the association was not significant ( p = 0.71) ( Table 3 ). 3.3 Distribution of Cryptosporidium species RFLP analysis of the PCR products from the 31 positive specimens produced banding patterns indicative of the presence of C. bovis in 14 (7.2%) specimens, C. ryanae in eight (4.1%) specimens and C. andersoni in five (2.6%) specimens. Mixed infections of C. bovis and C. ryanae and C. bovis and C. andersoni were detected in three (1.5%) and one (0.5%) specimen, respectively ( Table 3 ). There was a significant difference ( p = 0.022) in the occurrence of C. bovis and C. ryanae between calves younger and older than 180 days, with the former more likely to be infected with C. bovis or C. ryanae ( Table 3 ). 3.4 Sequence analysis of the SSU rRNA gene of Cryptosporidium spp. DNA sequencing of the SSU rRNA PCR products from four C. bovis specimens, four C. andersoni specimens and one C. ryanae specimen confirmed the identification of Cryptosporidium species by the RFLP analysis. The partial SSU rRNA gene sequences obtained from the products had 100% similarity to reference sequences in the GenBank for C. bovis ( AB441689 and AY120911 ), C. ryanae (GQ345007 and AB513679 ), and C. andersoni ( AB513856 and GQ121017). 4 Discussion The 16% infection rate of cryptosporidiosis in native calves was higher than the one (6.3%) previously reported in traditionally reared calves younger than 3 months in Zambia ( Geurden et al., 2006 ) but lower than the one (52.3%) reported in animals of 3\u20136-months in age in Nigeria ( Ayinmode et al., 2010 ). The disparities could be attributed to differences in breed of cattle, age, management systems and the techniques used in detecting Cryptosporidium . The White Fulani breed is considered more resistant to diseases than the Sokoto Gudalis ( Tawah and Rege, 1996 ) and this could have been the reason why Cryptosporidium spp. was less prevalent in the former than in the latter. The higher infection rate of Cryptosporidium in semi-intensive management system may be partially because animals were confined to a restricted area, thus continuously contaminated the surroundings. As in dairy cattle ( Sant\u0131n et al., 2004; Fayer et al., 2007 ), the infection rate of Cryptosporidium spp. in native breeds of cattle decreased with age. A higher infection rate of Cryptosporidium spp. was seen in diarrheic calves, although C. bovis , C. ryanae , and C. andersoni infections are usually not associated with the occurrence of diarrhea in dairy cattle ( Fayer et al., 2007 ), and other potential co-pathogens were not examined in this study. Further studies are required to determine whether these Cryptosporidium spp. contribute to the occurrence of diarrhea in calves of native breeds. An age-related distribution of C. parvum , C. bovis , C. ryanae and C. andersoni has been reported in dairy cattle ( Sant\u0131n et al., 2004; Fayer et al., 2007; Starkey et al., 2006; Coklin et al., 2007; Feng et al., 2007; Geurden et al., 2007; Langkjaer et al., 2007; Halim et al., 2008 ). Only pre-weaned calves were shown to be major source of C. parvum ( Xiao and Feng, 2008 ). In addition to C. parvum , dairy cattle are commonly infected with C. andersoni , C. bovis , and C. ryanae . The majority of C. parvum infections appear to be limited to dairy calves under eight weeks of age ( Sant\u0131n et al., 2004; Fayer et al., 2007; Langkjaer et al., 2007 ). Some other studies demonstrated that C. bovis could be detected in calves as early as three weeks of age ( Sant\u0131n et al., 2004; Fayer et al., 2007 ). Feng et al. (2007) reported both C. bovis and C. ryanae in all age groups of cattle in several locations. C. andersoni on the other hand has been reported more in calves older than 12 weeks of age ( Sant\u0131n et al., 2004 ). In this study, an age-associated difference in the distribution of Cryptosporidium species was also seen in native breeds of cattle in Nigeria, although the pattern appeared to be different from the one seen in dairy cattle in industrialized nations and some developing countries. In this study, C. parvum was not detected in native breeds of cattle irrespective of the age of animals. Instead, there was an early occurrence of C. bovis and C. ryanae in calves, and their infection rates were significantly higher in animals of six months or younger. Recently, Ayinmode et al. (2010) also failed to detect C. parvum in native breeds of calves in southwestern Nigeria, but the age of animals sampled was \u22653 months. In contrast, 35 of the 194 study animals were younger than 3 months in this study, nine of which were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. In Zambia, all five genetically characterized specimens from traditionally reared calves younger than three months also belonged to C. bovis ( Geurden et al., 2006 ). Thus, in native breeds of cattle or cattle reared in traditional husbandry systems in developing countries, C. bovis and C. ryanae appear early in calves in the absence of C. parvum . The infection pattern for C. andersoni , nevertheless, appeared to be similar to the one seen in dairy and beef cattle in industrialized nations. In conclusion, the absence of zoonotic C. parvum in the young native calves in Nigeria suggests that native breeds of cattle may not be important in the epidemiology of human cryptosporidiosis in developing countries. Nevertheless, this observation needs supports from other studies in other areas, preferably involving larger numbers of native breeds of taurine and Zebu cattle as well as other domestic bovines such as water buffalos, yaks, and bisons. Such data will be improve our understanding of Cryptosporidium transmission in farm animals, and promote the development of sustainable control strategies against cryptosporidiosis in both developing and developed countries.

In the present study, a retrospective analysis of 109 microscopically Cryptosporidium-positive faecal specimens from Western Australian patients, collected between 2015 and 2018 was conducted. Sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA and the 60\u202fkDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene loci identified four Cryptosporidium species: C. hominis (86.2%, 94/109), C. parvum (11.0%, 12/109), C. meleagridis (1.8%, 2/109) and C. viatorum (0.9%, 1/109). Subtyping at the gp60 locus identified a total of 11 subtypes including the emergence of the previously rare C. hominis IfA12G1R5 subtype in 2017 as the dominant subtype (46.7%, 21/45). This subtype has also recently emerged as the dominant subtype in the United States but the reasons for its emergence are unknown. This is also the first report of C. viatorum in humans in Australia and a novel subtype (XVaA3g) was identified in the one positive patient.",

        "abstract": "In this study, nine C. muris and 43 C. andersoni isolates from various animals in China were subtyped by a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) tool. DNA sequence analyses showed the presence of 1-2 subtypes of C. muris and 2-6 subtypes of C. andersoni at each of the four loci (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS16), nine of which represented new subtypes. Altogether, two C. muris and 10 C. andersoni MLST subtypes were detected. Linkage disequilibrium analysis indicated although the overall population structure of the two parasites was clonal, the Chinese C. andersoni in cattle has an epidemic structure. Three and two clusters were produced in the C. muris and C. andersoni populations by Structure 2.3.3 analysis, with Chinese C. muris and C. andersoni substructures differing from other countries. Thus, this study suggested the prevalence of C. andersoni in China is not attributed to the introduction of dairy cattle. More studies involving more genetic loci and systematic sampling are needed to better elucidate the population genetic structure of C. muris and C. andersoni in the world and the genetic basis for the difference in host specificity among the two most common gastric parasites.",

These tools have been increasingly used in characterizing the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. in humans and animals. Results of these molecular epidemiologic studies have led to better appreciation of the public health importance of Cryptosporidium species/genotypes in various animals and improved understanding of infection sources in humans. Geographic, seasonal and socioeconomic differences in the distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. in humans have been identified, and have been attributed to differences in infection sources and transmission routes. The transmission of C. parvum in humans is mostly anthroponotic in developing countries, with zoonotic infections play an important role in developed countries. Species of Cryptosporidium and subtype families of C. hominis have been shown to induce different clinical manifestations and have different potential to cause outbreaks. The wide use of a new generation of genotyping and subtyping tools in well designed epidemiologic studies should lead to a more in-depth understanding of the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in humans and animals.",

This study aimed to characterize the transmission of cryptosporidiosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Stool specimens were collected from 500 HIV-infected patients as part of the routine patient care. Cryptosporidium species in stool specimens were detected and differentiated using a small subunit rRNA-based polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. C. hominis and C. parvum were found and subtyped by DNA sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. Cryptosporidium species were detected in 36 HIV patients and none were found among non-HIV patients. A CD4+ count < 200 cells/\u03bcL was a significant risk factor for acquiring cryptosporidiosis (odds ratio = 21.214; 95% confidence interval = 9.917, 45.381; p < 0.0001). Cryptosporidium infection was also associated with weight loss and diarrhea. Other risk factors included animal contact, and using stream/river or well water as drinking water. Genotyping of the Cryptosporidium species identified the presence of C. hominis (47.2%), C. parvum (44.4%), C. felis (5.6%) and C. canis (2.8%). The C. hominis specimens subtyped belonged to the Ia, Ib and Ie subtype families, whereas those of C. parvum belonged to the IIc and two new subtype families. Anthroponotic transmission appears to be important in cryptosporidiosis epidemiology in HIV-infected persons in Nigeria despite the high frequency of C. parvum infection and the identification of animal contact as a risk factor.",

        "abstract": "There are very few studies on the diversity and public health significance of Cryptosporidium species in zebu cattle and water buffaloes in developing countries. In this study, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses of the small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene were used to genotype Cryptosporidium specimens from 12 zebu cattle calves, 16 water buffalo calves, and four swamp deer (Cervus duvaucelii) collected from the buffer zone of the Chitwan National Park, Nepal. All Cryptosporidium specimens from cattle and buffaloes belonged to Cryptosporidium ryanae, whereas those from deer belonged to Cryptosporidium ubiquitum. Comparison of the SSU rRNA gene sequences obtained with those from earlier studies has identified a nucleotide substitution unique to all C. ryanae isolates from Nepal, in addition to some sequence heterogeneity among different copies of the gene. The finding of the dominance of a unique C. ryanae variant in both zebu cattle and water buffaloes in Nepal indicates that there is unique cryptosporidiosis transmission in bovine animals in the study area, and cross-species transmission of some Cryptosporidium spp. can occur between related animal species sharing the same habitats.",

To investigate subtypes of Cryptosporidium spp. isolated from humans and cattle in Iran, 47 Cryptosporidium parvum (22 from children and 25 from cattle) and three Cryptosporidium hominis from children were characterized by sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. Nine subtypes (two of C. hominis and seven of C. parvum) in four subtype families were identified. Cattle were mainly infected with C. parvum IIa subtypes and humans mostly with the C. parvum IIa and IId subtypes. Consequently, cattle could be a source of human infection with C. parvum IIa in Iran. However, the occurrence of subtype IId families in Iranian children, suggests that other infection sources might also be involved in C. parvum transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first published record and description of Cryptosporidium subtypes in Iran.",

In this study, the effect of immune activation by a crude Cryptosporidium whole antigen on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was evaluated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy persons without HIV-1 infection had increased proliferative and cytokine (interleukin-4, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) responses to stimulation with the crude Cryptosporidium whole antigen. This stimulation increased HIV-1 p24 antigen production in in vitro infection by>30-fold. A similar increase in p24 production was also seen when stimulation was done after cells were infected with HIV-1. Neutralization of TNF-alpha reduced Cryptosporidium antigen-induced p24 production by >50%. Results of this study suggest that Cryptosporidium-induced immune activation may be a cofactor in regulating HIV-1 production.",

In this study, we screened the C. muris whole-genome sequencing data for microsatellite and minisatellite sequences. Among the 13 potential loci (6 microsatellite and 7 minisatellite loci) evaluated by PCR and DNA sequencing, 4 were eventually chosen. DNA sequence analyses of 27 C. muris and 17 C. andersoni DNA preparations showed the presence of 5 to 10 subtypes of C. muris and 1 to 4 subtypes of C. andersoni at each locus. Altogether, 11 C. muris and 7 C. andersoni multilocus sequence typing (MLST) subtypes were detected among the 16 C. muris and 12 C. andersoni specimens successfully sequenced at all four loci. In all analyses, the C. muris isolate (TS03) that originated from an East African mole rat differed significantly from other C. muris isolates, approaching the extent of genetic differences between C. muris and C. andersoni. Thus, an MLST technique was developed for the high-resolution typing of C. muris and C. andersoni. It should be useful for the characterization of the population genetics and transmission of gastric Cryptosporidium spp.",

        "abstract": "The cellular tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is dependent on utilization of specific chemokine co-receptor: macrophage-tropic/non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) viruses use CCR5, whereas T-cell tropic/syncytium-inducing (SI) viruses preferentially use CXCR4. We have analyzed co-receptor usage of 24 phylogenetically distinct primary HIV-1 isolates representing group M (clades A-F) and group O with known SI and NSI phenotype, using lymphocytes from donor with nonfunctional CCR5 (CCR5-/-; homozygous 32-bp deletion). While all SI isolates infected CCR5-/- lymphocytes (and hence do not require CCR5 for viral entry), all NSI isolates, regardless of clade, did not infect CCR5-/- lymphocytes. Thus, CCR5 expression is required for infection with NSI isolates and the CCR5 usage is independent of viral genotype. To localize the viral determinant involved in CCR5 binding, the V3 sequences across the clades were aligned based on the CCR5 usage. There were conserved uncharged residues at position 11 of V3 (mostly serine/glycine) and negatively charged residues at residue 25 (mostly glutamic/aspartic acid) among all isolates that used CCR5, whereas substitution with arginine or glutamine at these two positions led to usage of a co-receptor other than CCR5. This analysis led us to identify a consensus motif S/GXXXGPGXXXXXXXE/D within the V3 loop that predicts CCR5 co-receptor usage. Most isolates, with exception of one isolate, containing the conserved motif and predicted to utilize CCR5 indeed had an absolute requirement of CCR5 expression for infectibility. Site-directed mutagenesis in the infectious molecular clone further confirmed these results. Taken together, these data provide evidence that sequences within the V3 loop provide important residues that might be directly or indirectly involved in binding to a CCR5 co-receptor.",

The FALVAC-1A protein was purified by inclusion body isolation, followed by affinity and ion exchange chromatography. Although FALVAC-1A was a synthetic antigen, it folded to a specific, but as yet incompletely defined, molecular conformation that was stable and comparable from lot to lot. When formulated with four different adjuvants, FALVAC-1A was highly immunogenic in rabbits, inducing not only ELISA reactivity to the cognate antigen and most of its component epitopes, but also in vitro activity against P. falciparum parasites as demonstrated by inhibition of sporozoite invasion, antibody dependent cellular inhibition and the immunofluorescence assay.",

A total of 2,672 patients participated in this study and provided 13,937 specimens. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected by microscopy in 354 (13.3%) of the patients. Analysis of 951 Cryptosporidium-positive specimens from 300 patients using a small subunit rRNA-based PCR-RFLP tool identified 6 genotypes; Cryptosporidium hominis was the species most frequently detected (67.5%), followed by C. meleagridis (12.6%) and C. parvum (11.3%). Cryptosporidium canis (4.0%), C. felis (3.3%), and Cryptosporidium pig genotype (0.5%) were also found. These findings indicate that C. hominis is the predominant species in Peruvian HIV-positive persons, and that zoonotic Cryptosporidium spp. account for about 30% of cryptosporidiosis in these patients.",

        "abstract": "In August 2000, the Ohio Department of Health requested assistance to investigate a cryptosporidiosis outbreak with more than 700 clinical case-patients. An epidemiologic and environmental investigation was conducted. Stool specimens, pool water, and sand filter samples were analyzed. A community-based case-control study showed that the main risk factor was swimming in pool A (odds ratio [OR] = 42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 12.3-144.9). This was supported by results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, which showed the presence of both the human and bovine genotypes of Cryptosporidium parvum in case-patients and samples from the filter of pool A. A pool-based case-control study indicated that the highest risk was related to exposure to pool water via the mouth (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 2.1-12.5) or to pool sprinklers (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.3-4.7). Fecal accidents at the pool were documented. Records indicated that the pool met local health regulations. The outbreak, caused by co-infection with two C. parvum genotypes (human and bovine), underscores the need for concerted action to improve public health policies for recreational water facilities and enhanced education regarding the potential for disease transmission through pools.",

        "abstract": "To better characterize Cryptosporidium in the Potomac River watershed, a PCR-based genotyping tool was used to analyze 64 base flow and 28 storm flow samples from five sites in the watershed. These sites included two water treatment plant intakes, as well as three upstream sites, each associated with a different type of land use. The uses, including urban wastewater, agricultural (cattle) wastewater, and wildlife, posed different risks in terms of the potential contribution of Cryptosporidium oocysts to the source water. Cryptosporidium was detected in 27 base flow water samples and 23 storm flow water samples. The most frequently detected species was C. andersoni (detected in 41 samples), while 14 other species or genotypes, almost all wildlife associated, were occasionally detected. The two common human-pathogenic species, C. hominis and C. parvum, were not detected. Although C. andersoni was common at all four sites influenced by agriculture, it was largely absent at the urban wastewater site. There were very few positive samples as determined by Environmental Protection Agency method 1623 at any site; only 8 of 90 samples analyzed (9%) were positive for Cryptosporidium as determined by microscopy. The genotyping results suggest that many of the Cryptosporidium oocysts in the water treatment plant source waters were from old calves and adult cattle and might not pose a significant risk to human health.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis has recently attracted attention as an emerging waterborne and foodborne disease as well as an opportunistic infection in HIV infected individuals. The lack of genetic information, however, has resulted in confusion in the taxonomy of Cryptosporidium parasites and in the development of molecular tools for the identification and typing of oocysts in environmental samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene has shown that the genus Cryptosporidium comprises several distinct species. Our data show the presence of at least four species: C. parvum, C. muris, C. baileyi and C. serpentis (C. meleagridis, C. nasorum and C. felis were not studied). Within each species, there is some sequence variation. Thus, various genotypes (genotype 1, genotype 2, guinea pig genotype, monkey genotype and koala genotype, etc.) of C. parvum differ from each other in six regions of the SSU rRNA gene. Information on polymorphism in Cryptosporidium parasites has been used in the development of species and strain-specific diagnostic tools. Use of these tools in the characterization of oocysts in various samples indicates that C. parvum genotype 1 is the strain responsible for most human Cryptosporidium infections. In contrast, genotype 2 is probably one of the major sources for environmental contamination, and has been found in most oysters examined from Chesapeake Bay that may serve as biologic monitors of estuarine waters.",

In this study, four rhesus monkeys were infected with P. coatneyi, with another four animals serving as uninfected controls. Blood samples were taken for the determination of daily parasitemia, and cytokine and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels at days 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. All inoculated animals became infected, with synchronized appearance of ring-stage parasites. Infected monkeys had increased plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) during the late stage of the infection. They also had increased production of ciliary neurotrophic factor. In conjunction with the production of proinflammatory cytokines, infected monkeys also had gradual increases in the production of PGE2. A continued definition of the P. coatneyi/rhesus monkey animal model should be useful for the elucidation of the immunopathogenesis of human malaria.",

        "abstract": "The 13th International Workshops on Opportunistic Protists (IWOP-13) was held November 13 to 15, 2014 in Seville, Spain. The objectives of the IWOP meetings are to: (1) Serve as a forum for exchange of new information among active researchers concerning the basic biology, molecular genetics, immunology, biochemistry, pathogenesis, drug development, therapy, and epidemiology of these immunodeficiency associated pathogenic eukaryotic microorganisms that are seen in patients with AIDS; and (2) to foster the entry of new and young investigators into these underserved research areas. The IWOP meeting focuses on opportunistic protists; e.g. the free-living amoebae, Pneumocystis, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, the Microsporidia, and kinetoplastid flagellates. This conference represents the major conference which brings together research groups working on these opportunistic pathogens. Progress has been achieved on understanding the biology of these pathogenic organisms, their involvement in disease causation in both immune deficient and immune competent hosts and is providing important insights into these emerging and reemerging pathogens. A continuing concern of the participants is the ongoing loss of scientific expertise and diversity in this research community. This decline is due to the small size of these research communities and an ongoing lack of understanding by the broader scientific community of the challenges and limitations faced by researchers working on these organisms, which makes these research communities very sensitive to declines in research funding.

Results of the phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of several genetically distinct species in the genus Cryptosporidium and eight distinct genotypes within the species C. parvum. Some of the latter may represent cryptic species. The phylogenetic tree constructed from these sequences is in agreement with our previous results based on the small-subunit rRNA genes of Cryptosporidium parasites. The Cryptosporidium species formed two major clades: isolates of C. muris and C. serpentis formed the first major group, while isolates of C. felis, C. meleagridis, C. wrairi, and eight genotypes of C. parvum formed the second major group. Sequence variations were also observed between C. muris isolates from ruminants and rodents. The HSP70 gene provides another useful locus for phylogenetic analysis of the genus Cryptosporidium.",

Fifty-eight of the children (94%) had Cryptosporidium parvum, three (5%) had Cryptosporidium hominis, and one (1%) had both C. parvum and C. hominis. Altogether, 13 subtypes of C. parvum (belonging to four subtype allele families) and C. hominis (belonging to three subtype allele families) were observed, with 92% of specimens belonging to the common allele family IIa and the unusual allele family IId. Thus, the transmission of cryptosporidiosis in Kuwaiti children differed significantly from other tropical countries. Cryptosporidiosis is a significant cause of diarrheal diseases in both developing and industrialized nations. Recent molec- ular epidemiologic studies of cryptosporidiosis have helped researchers to better understand the transmission of crypto- sporidiosis in humans and the public health significance of Cryptosporidium spp. in animals and the environment. Using genotyping tools, five species of Cryptosporidium (C. hominis, C. parvum, C. meleagridis, C. felis, and C. canis) have been shown to be responsible for most human infections. Of these five species, C. hominis and C. parvum are the two most com- mon species (34). Because these five human pathogenic Cryp- tosporidium species have different spectrums of host specificity, the characterization of Cryptosporidium at the species level is useful in investigating infection and contamination sources. Recently, a number of subtyping tools have been developed and used to characterize the population structure and trans- mission dynamics of C. parvum and C. hominis (2, 8, 17, 18, 24- 26, 29, 30). Although cryptosporidiosis is prevalent in tropical regions, limited studies have been conducted to characterize Cryptospo- ridium spp. from humans at the molecular level. Several studies have examined the transmission of human cryptosporidiosis in South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, Uganda, Peru, and Thailand, all of which have shown a predominance of C. hominis in humans, indicating anthroponotic transmission plays a major role in the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in most tropical countries (7, 17, 25, 31-33). Only two of the studies subtyped small numbers of Cryptosporidium spp. (17, 25). In the present study, 62 Cryp- tosporidium-positive specimens were collected from children in Kuwait City between 1997 and 2004 and examined by a small subunit (SSU) rRNA-based PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis and a 60-kDa glycopro- tein (GP60)-based PCR sequencing tool (2, 33). Results of the study have shown a predominance in children of C. parvum, which traditionally is associated with farm animals. Thus, an- throponotic transmission was possibly less important in human cryptosporidiosis in Kuwait City than in other tropical regions.",

        "abstract": "The widespread usages of molecular epidemiological tools have improved the understanding of cryptosporidiosis transmission. Much attention on zoonotic cryptosporidiosis is centered on Cryptosporidium parvum. Results of genotype surveys indicate that calves are the only major reservoir for C. parvum infections in humans. The widespread presence of human-adapted C. parvum, especially in developing countries, is revealed by recent subtyping and multilocus typing studies, which have also demonstrated the anthroponotic transmission of C. parvum subtypes shared by humans and cattle. Developing and industrialized countries differ significantly in disease burdens caused by zoonotic species and in the source of these parasites, with the former having far fewer human infections caused by C. parvum and little zoonotic transmission of this species. Exclusive anthroponotic transmission of seemingly zoonotic C. parvum subtypes was seen in Mid-Eastern countries. Other zoonotic Cryptosporidium spp. are also responsible for substantial numbers of human infections in developing countries, many of which are probably transmitted by anthroponotic pathways. The lower pathogenicity of some zoonotic species in some populations supports the occurrence of different clinical spectra of Cryptosporidium spp. in humans. The use of a new generation of molecular diagnostic tools is likely to produce a more complete picture of zoonotic cryptosporidiosis.",

To assess the importance of these animals as a source of human Cryptosporidium infections, fecal samples from 180 calves, heifers and adults and 51 farm workers on two dairy farms in West Bengal, India were genotyped by PCR-RFLP analysis of the 18S rRNA gene of Cryptosporidium followed by DNA sequencing of the PCR products. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the DNA sequences obtained in the study and those available in GenBank. The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium in cattle was 11.7% though the infection was more prevalent in younger calves than in adult cattle. The occurrence of Cryptosporidium parvum , Cryptosporidium bovis , Cryptosporidium ryanae and Cryptosporidium andersoni in cattle followed an age-related pattern. A Cryptosporidium suis -like genotype was also detected in a calf. Farm workers were infected with Cryptosporidium hominis , C. parvum and a novel C. bovis genotype. These findings clearly suggest that there is a potential risk of zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium infections between cattle and humans on dairy farms in India.",

Approximately 5 \u00d7 10(4) sporozoites and oocysts mixture for group I; 5 \u00d7 10(5), 1 \u00d7 10(6), 2 \u00d7 10(6) purified sporozoites for group II, group III and group IV, respectively, were inoculated into respective chick embryo tracheal rings maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, and cultivated in each well of the 24-well culture plate at 40\u00b0C and 5% CO(2). The tracheal rings in four experimental groups (I-IV) were successfully infected with C. baileyi, and different stages of parasites were also observed under light and electron microscopy. Parasite infection and cytological alterations were noted as early as PI 72 h. The Cryptosporidium were seen attached to the edge of the tracheal epithelium, with more number of parasites in group I than that in group II, group III and group IV. The moderate nuclear swelling and chromatin margination were also detected, and the normal vertical orientation and basilar location of the nuclei of the epithelial cells were almost lost. C. baileyi that has been passed by TOCs exhibited similar immunity and molecular features with parasites before intratracheal inoculation. These results suggest that chick embryo tracheal organ is a new and effective in vitro culture model for C. baileyi and other respiratory pathogens.",

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium species or genotypes in ostriches. A total of 452 fecal samples from five farms, a zoo, and an animal rescue center in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China were examined for Cryptosporidium oocysts by microscopy of wet mount of fecal materials concentrated by the Sheather's sugar flotation technique. Fifty-three samples were Cryptosporidium-positive from four farms, with an overall prevalence of 11.7%.

PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene of the 53 Cryptosporidium-positive samples showed the presence of only Cryptosporidium baileyi, which was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the SSU rRNA PCR products from 16 positive samples.

The epidemiology of these diseases and microsporidiosis in humans in developing countries is poorly understood. The high concentration of pathogens in raw sewage makes the characterization of the transmission of these pathogens simple through the genotype and subtype analysis of a small number of samples.The distribution of genotypes and subtypes of Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis, and Enterocytozoon bieneusi in 386 samples of combined sewer systems from Shanghai, Nanjing and Wuhan and the sewer system in Qingdao in China was determined using PCR-sequencing tools. Eimeria spp. were also genotyped to assess the contribution of domestic animals to Cryptosporidium spp., G. duodenalis, and E. bieneusi in wastewater. The high occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. (56.2%), G. duodenalis (82.6%), E. bieneusi (87.6%), and Eimeria/Cyclospora (80.3%) made the source attribution possible. As expected, several human-pathogenic species/genotypes, including Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium meleagridis, G. duodenalis sub-assemblage A-II, and E. bieneusi genotype D, were the dominant parasites in wastewater. In addition to humans, the common presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and Eimeria spp. from rodents indicated that rodents might have contributed to the occurrence of E. bieneusi genotype D in samples. Likewise, the finding of Eimeria spp. and Cryptosporidium baileyi from birds indicated that C. meleagridis might be of both human and bird origins.The distribution of Cryptosporidium species, G. duodenalis genotypes and subtypes, and E. bieneusi genotypes in urban wastewater indicates that anthroponotic transmission appeared to be important in epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, and microsporidiosis in the study areas. The finding of different distributions of subtypes between Shanghai and Wuhan was indicative of possible differences in the source of C. hominis among different areas in China.",

However, few studies have examined the distribution of Cryptosporidium species and Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes in AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In the present study, 683 HIV-positive patients in the National Free Antiretroviral Therapy Program in China and 683 matched HIV-negative controls were enrolled. Cryptosporidium species and subtypes and Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes were detected and differentiated by PCR and DNA sequencing. The infection rates were 1.5% and 0.15% for Cryptosporidium and 5.7% and 4.2% for E. bieneusi in HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants, respectively. The majority (8/11) of Cryptosporidium cases were infections by zoonotic species, including Cryptosporidium meleagridis (5), Cryptosporidium parvum (2), and Cryptosporidium suis (1). Prevalent E. bieneusi genotypes detected, including EbpC (39), D (12), and type IV (7), were also potentially zoonotic. The common occurrence of EbpC was a feature of E. bieneusi transmission not seen in other areas. Contact with animals was a risk factor for both cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis. The results suggest that zoonotic transmission was significant in the epidemiology of both diseases in rural AIDS patients in China.",

Sequence characterizations of the small-subunit rRNA gene showed that the LI03 isolate was C. andersoni and the other three isolates belonged to C. muris, although the TS03 isolate showed unique sequence variations (one single nucleotide change and four nucleotide insertions). C. andersoni LI03 was infectious for calves only, whereas lambs and kids were susceptible to C. muris CB03. C. muris TS03 and RN66 were not infectious for any farm ruminants. Infection dynamics including prepatent and patent period and infection intensity of the isolates used differed depending on the host species, but no clinical signs of cryptosporidiosis were observed in any of experimentally infected hosts. Cryptosporidium developmental stages were only detected in infected animals in the abomasum region. Histopathological changes were characterized by dilatation and epithelial metaplasia of infected gastric glands with no significant inflammatory responses in the lamina propria.",

Six water samples from these farms had C. andersoni, five had the C. parvum bovine genotype, and one had Cryptosporidium muris. In contrast, four PCR-positive human samples produced the C. parvum bovine genotype and two had the C. parvum human genotype.

        "abstract": "The Navajo Nation includes approximately 250,000 American Indians living in a remote high desert environment with limited access to public water systems. We conducted a pilot case-control study to assess associations between acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and water availability, use patterns, and quality. Case patients with AGE and non-AGE controls who presented for care to two Indian Health Service hospitals were recruited. Data on demographics and water use practices were collected using a standard questionnaire. Household drinking water was tested for presence of pathogens, coliforms, and residual chlorine. Sixty-one subjects (32 cases and 29 controls) participated in the study. Cases and controls were not significantly different with respect to water sources, quality, or patterns of use. Twenty-one percent (n = 12) of study participants resided in dwellings not connected to a community water system. Eleven percent (n = 7) of subjects reported drinking hauled water from unregulated sources. Coliform bacteria were present in 44% (n = 27) of household water samples, and 68% (n = 40) of samples contained residual chlorine concentrations of <0.2 mg/L. This study highlights issues with water availability, quality, and use patterns within the Navajo Nation, including sub-optimal access to community water systems, and use of water hauled from unregulated sources.",

To accelerate research on parasites in the genus Cryptosporidium , we generated annotated, draft genome sequences of human C. hominis isolates TU502_2012 and UKH1, C. meleagridis UKMEL1, also isolated from a human patient, and the avian parasite C. baileyi TAMU-09Q1. The annotation of the genome sequences relied in part on RNAseq data generated from the oocyst stage of both C. hominis and C. baileyi . The genome assembly of C. hominis is significantly more complete and less fragmented than that available previously, which enabled the generation of a much-improved gene set for this species, with an increase in average gene length of 500 bp relative to the protein-encoding genes in the 2004 C. hominis annotation. Our results reveal that the genomes of C. hominis and C. parvum are very similar in both gene density and average gene length. These data should prove a valuable resource for the Cryptosporidium research community.",

        "abstract": "Enterocytozoon bieneusi is a widespread parasite with high genetic diversity among hosts. Its natural reservoir remains elusive and data on population structure are available only in isolates from primates. Here we describe a population genetic study of 101 E. bieneusi isolates from pigs using sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and four mini- and microsatellite markers. The presence of strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited genetic recombination indicated a clonal structure for the population. Bayesian inference of phylogeny, structural analysis, and principal coordinates analysis separated the overall population into three subpopulations (SP3 to SP5) with genetic segregation of the isolates at some geographic level. Comparative analysis showed the differentiation of SP3 to SP5 from the two known E. bieneusi subpopulations (SP1 and SP2) from primates. The placement of a human E. bieneusi isolate in pig subpopulation SP4 supported the zoonotic potential of some E. bieneusi isolates. Network analysis showed directed evolution of SP5 to SP3/SP4 and SP1 to SP2. The high LD and low number of inferred recombination events are consistent with the possibility of host adaptation in SP2, SP3, and SP4. In contrast, the reduced LD and high genetic diversity in SP1 and SP5 might be results of broad host range and adaptation to new host environment. The data provide evidence of the potential occurrence of host adaptation in some of E. bieneusi isolates that belong to the zoonotic ITS Group 1.",

        "abstract": " is a leading cause of diarrhea among Kenyan infants. Ceramic water filters (CWFs) are used for household water treatment. We assessed the impact of CWFs on diarrhea, cryptosporidiosis prevention, and water quality in rural western Kenya. A randomized, controlled intervention trial was conducted in 240 households with infants 4-10 months old. Twenty-six weekly household surveys assessed infant diarrhea and health facility visits. Stool specimens from infants with diarrhea were examined for . Source water, filtered water, and filter retentate were tested for  and/or microbial indicators. To estimate the effect of CWFs on health outcomes, logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations were performed; odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Households reported using surface water (36%), public taps (29%), or rainwater (17%) as their primary drinking water sources, with no differences in treatment groups. Intervention households reported less diarrhea (7.6% versus 8.9%; OR: 0.86 [0.64-1.16]) and significantly fewer health facility visits for diarrhea (1.0% versus 1.9%; OR: 0.50 [0.30-0.83]). In total, 15% of intervention and 12% of control stools yielded  ( = 0.26).  was detected in 93% of source water samples; 71% of filtered water samples met World Health Organization recommendations of < 1 /100 mL.  was not detected in source water and was detected in just 2% of filter rinses following passage of large volumes of source water. Water quality was improved among CWF users; however, the short study duration and small sample size limited our ability to observe reductions in cryptosporidiosis.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium is a common cause of sporadic diarrheal disease and outbreaks in the United States. Increasingly, immunochromatography-based rapid cartridge assays (RCAs) are providing community laboratories with a quick cryptosporidiosis diagnostic method. In the current study, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), and four state health departments evaluated RCA-positive samples obtained during routine Cryptosporidium testing. All samples underwent \"head to head\" re-testing using both RCA and direct fluorescence assay (DFA). Community level results from three sites indicated that 54.4% (166/305) of Meridian ImmunoCard STAT! positives and 87.0% (67/77) of Remel Xpect positives were confirmed by DFA. When samples were retested by RCA at state laboratories and compared with DFA, 83.3% (155/186) of Meridian ImmunoCard STAT! positives and 95.2% (60/63) of Remel Xpect positives were confirmed. The percentage of confirmed community results varied by site: Minnesota, 39.0%; New York, 63.9%; and Wisconsin, 72.1%. The percentage of confirmed community results decreased with patient age; 12.5% of community positive tests could be confirmed by DFA for patients 60 years of age or older. The percentage of confirmed results did not differ significantly by sex, storage temperature, time between sample collection and testing, or season. Findings from this study demonstrate a lower confirmation rate of community RCA positives when compared to RCA positives identified at state laboratories. Elucidating the causes of decreased test performance in order to improve overall community laboratory performance of these tests is critical for understanding the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in the United States (US).",

In the standard for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents in China and other countries, the fecal coliform count is the only microbial indicator, raising concerns about the potential for pathogen transmission through WWTP effluent reuse. In this study, we collected 50 effluent samples (30 L/sample) from three municipal WWTPs in Shanghai, China, and analyzed for Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis and Enterocytozoon bieneusi by microscopy and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Moreover, propidium monoazide (PMA)-PCR was used to assess the viability of oocysts/cysts. The microscopy and PCR-positive rates for Cryptosporidium spp. were 62% and 40%, respectively. The occurrence rates of G. duodenalis were 96% by microscopy and 92\u2013100% by PCR analysis of three genetic loci. Furthermore, E. bieneusi was detected in 70% (35/50) of samples by PCR. Altogether, 10 Cryptosporidium species or genotypes, two G. duodenalis genotypes, and 11 E. bieneusi genotypes were found, most of which were human-pathogenic. The chlorine dioxide disinfection employed in WWTP1 and WWTP3 failed to inactivate the residual pathogens; 93% of the samples from WWTP1 and 83% from WWTP3 did not meet the national standard on fecal coliform levels. Thus, urban WWTP effluents often contain residual waterborne human pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Extensive genetic variation is observed within the genus  Cryptosporidium  and the distribution of  Cryptosporidium  species/genotypes in humans and animals appears to vary by geography and host species. To better understand the genetic diversity of  Cryptosporidium  spp. in horses and donkeys, we characterized five horse-derived and 82 donkey-derived  Cryptosporidium  isolates from five provinces or autonomous regions (Sichuan, Gansu, Henan, Inner Mongolia and Shandong) in China at the species/genotype and subtype levels. Three  Cryptosporidium  species/genotypes were identified based on the analysis of the SSU rRNA gene, including  Cryptosporidium parvum  (n\u00a0=\u00a022), the  Cryptosporidium  horse genotype (n\u00a0=\u00a04), and  Cryptosporidium hominis  (n\u00a0=\u00a061). The identification of  C. hominis  was confirmed by sequence analysis of the HSP70 and actin genes. Subtyping using sequence analysis of the 60\u00a0kDa glycoprotein gene identified 21  C. parvum  isolates as subtype IIdA19G1, the four horse genotype isolates as subtypes VIaA15G4 (n\u00a0=\u00a02) and VIaA11G3 (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and the 61  C. hominis  isolates as IkA16G1 (n\u00a0=\u00a059) and IkA16 (n\u00a0=\u00a02). The common finding of  C. hominis  reaffirms the heterogeneity of  Cryptosporidium  spp. in horses and donkeys and is possibly a reflection of endemic transmission of  C. hominis  in these animals. Data of the study suggest that horses and donkeys as companion animals may potentially transmit  Cryptosporidium  infections to humans.",

        "abstract": "The environmental transport of  spp. through combined sewer overflow (CSO) and the occurrence of several emerging human-pathogenic  species in developing countries remain unclear. In this study, we collected 40 CSO samples and 40 raw wastewater samples from Shanghai, China, and examined them by PCR and DNA sequencing for  species (targeting the small subunit rRNA gene) and  (targeting the triosephosphate isomerase, \u03b2-giardin, and glutamate dehydrogenase genes) and  (targeting the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer) genotypes. Human-pathogenic  species were further subtyped by sequence analysis of the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene, with additional multilocus sequence typing on the emerging zoonotic pathogen  spp., , and  were detected in 12 and 15, 33 and 32, and 37 and 40 CSO and wastewater samples, respectively, including 10  species, 3  assemblages, and 8  genotypes. In addition to  and , two new pathogens identified in industrialized nations,  and , were frequently detected. The two novel  subtype families identified appeared to be genetic recombinants of known subtype families. Similarly, the dominant group 1  genotypes and  subassemblage AII are known human pathogens. The similar distribution of human-pathogenic  species and  and  genotypes between wastewater and CSO samples reaffirms that storm overflow is potentially a significant contamination source of pathogens in surface water. The frequent identification of  and  in urban wastewater suggests that these newly identified human pathogens may be endemic in China. spp., , and  are major waterborne pathogens. Their transport into surface water through combined sewer overflow, which remains largely untreated in developing countries, has not been examined. In addition, the identification of these pathogens to genotypes and subtypes in urban storm overflow and wastewater is necessary for rapid and accurate assessment of pathogen transmission in humans and transport in the environment. Data from this study suggest that, like untreated urban wastewater, combined sewer overflow is commonly contaminated with human-pathogenic , , and  genotypes and subtypes, and urban storm overflow potentially plays a significant role in the contamination of drinking source water and recreational water with human pathogens. They also indicate that  and , two newly identified human pathogens, may be common in China, and genetic recombination can lead to the emergence of novel  subtype families.",

In this study, 248 fecal specimens were collected from dairy calves aged 1\u202fday to 6\u202fmonths on eight farms in three provinces during March 2015 to April 2016. Cryptosporidium spp. were detected and genotyped by using PCR-RFLP analysis of the small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene, while G. duodenalis was detected and genotyped by using PCR and sequence analyses of the triose phosphate isomerase (tpi), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and \u03b2-giardin (bg) genes. The overall infection rates of Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis were 9.7 and 13.3%, respectively. The highest Cryptosporidium infection rate (26.7%) was in calves of age\u202f\u2264\u202f1\u202fmonth while the highest G. duodenalis infection rate (44.4%) was in calves of 2\u202fmonths. Three Cryptosporidium spp. were identified, including C. parvum (n\u202f=\u202f16), C. bovis (n\u202f=\u202f5) and C. ryanae (n\u202f=\u202f3), with the former being almost exclusively found in calves of \u22643\u202fmonths of age and the latter two being only found in calves of over 3\u202fmonths. Subtyping of C. parvum by PCR-sequence analysis of the 60\u202fkDa glycoprotein gene identified subtypes IIaA15G1R1 (n\u202f=\u202f15) and IIaA15G2R1 (n\u202f=\u202f1). The G. duodenalis identified included both assemblages E (n\u202f=\u202f32) and A (n\u202f=\u202f1), with the latter belonging to the anthroponotic subtype A2. These data provide new insights into the genetic diversity and age patterns of Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis in calves in Egypt.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Molecular diagnostic tools have played an important role in improving our understanding of the transmission of  Cryptosporidium  spp. and  Giardia duodenalis , which are two of the most important waterborne parasites in industrialized nations. Genotyping tools are frequently used in the identification of host-adapted  Cryptosporidium  species and  G. duodenalis  assemblages, allowing the assessment of infection sources in humans and public health potential of parasites found in animals and the environment. In contrast, subtyping tools are more often used in case linkages, advanced tracking of infections sources, and assessment of disease burdens attributable to anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission. More recently, multilocus typing tools have been developed for population genetic characterizations of transmission dynamics and delineation of mechanisms for the emergence of virulent subtypes. With the recent development in next generation sequencing techniques, whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis are increasingly used in characterizing  Cryptosporidium  spp. and  G. duodenalis . The use of these tools in epidemiologic studies has identified significant differences in the transmission of  Cryptosporidium  spp. in humans between developing countries and industrialized nations, especially the role of zoonotic transmission in human infection. Geographic differences are also present in the distribution of  G. duodenalis  assemblages A and B in humans. In contrast, there is little evidence for widespread zoonotic transmission of giardiasis in both developing and industrialized countries. Differences in virulence have been identified among  Cryptosporidium  species and subtypes, and possibly between  G. duodenalis  assemblages A and B, and genetic recombination has been identified as one mechanism for the emergence of virulent  C. hominis  subtypes. These recent advances are providing insight into the epidemiology of waterborne protozoan parasites in both developing and developed countries.",

        "abstract": "Little is known on the identity and public health potential of Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis and Enterocytozoon bieneusi in farm animals in Algeria. In this study, 102 fecal specimens from pre-weaned dairy calves with or without diarrhea were collected from 19 dairy farms located in 6 provinces. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the small subunit rRNA gene was used to detect and differentiate Cryptosporidium spp., whereas PCR-sequence analysis of the triosephosphate isomerase gene and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer were used to detect and genotype G. duodenalis and E. bieneusi, respectively. Cryptosporidium was found in 14 specimens, among which 7 had C. parvum, 4 had C. bovis, and 3 had mixed infection of C. parvum and C. bovis or C. bovis and C. andersoni. Subtyping of C. parvum by PCR-sequence analysis of the 60kDa glycoprotein gene identified two zoonotic subtypes IIaA16G2R1 and IIaA17G3R1. G. duodenalis was found in 28 specimens, with 6 having the host-specific assemblage E, 14 having the zoonotic assemblage A (all belonging to A2 subtype), and 8 having mixed assemblages. Six known genotypes of E. bieneusi belonging to Group 2, including I, J, BEB3, BEB4, BEB6 and PtEb XI, were identified in 11 specimens. Diarrhea was mostly associated with the occurrence of C. parvum. Data from this study suggest that human-pathogenic C. parvum subtypes and G. duodenalis and E. bieneusi genotypes are common on dairy farms in Algeria.",

        "abstract": "Molecular epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis is an active research area in China. The use of genotyping and subtyping tools in prevalence studies has led to the identification of unique characteristics of Cryptosporidium infections in humans and animals. Human cryptosporidiosis in China is exemplified by the high diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. at species and subtype levels, with dominant C. hominis and C. parvum subtypes being rarely detected in other countries. Similarly, preweaned dairy calves, lambs, and goat kids are mostly infected with non-pathogenic Cryptosporidium species (C. bovis in calves and C. xiaoi in lambs and goat kids), with C. parvum starting to appear in dairy calves as a consequence of concentrated animal feeding operations. The latter Cryptosporidium species is dominated by IId subtypes, with IIa subtypes largely absent from the country. Unlike elsewhere, rodents in China appear to be commonly infected with C. parvum IId subtypes, with identical subtypes being found in these animals, calves, other livestock, and humans. In addition to cattle, pigs and chickens appear to be significant contributors to Cryptosporidium contamination in drinking water sources, as reflected by the frequent detection of C. suis, C. baileyi and C. meleagridis in water samples. Chinese scientists have also made significant contributions to the development of new molecular epidemiological tools for Cryptosporidium spp. and improvements in our understanding of the mechanism involved in the emergence of hyper-transmissible and virulent C. hominis and C. parvum subtypes. Despite this progress, coordinated research efforts should be made to address changes in Cryptosporidium transmission because of rapid economic development in China and to prevent the introduction and spread of virulent and zoonotic Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in farm animals.",

Transmission intensity, genetic diversity, and occurrence of genetic recombination and selective pressure have further shaped their population genetic structures. Panmixia appears to be common within the zoonotic  C. parvum , especially its hypertransmissible IIaA15G2R1 subtype. Genetic recombination in  C. hominis , in contrast, is more restricted to virulent subtypes, especially IbA10G2. Nonhuman primates and equine animals are commonly infected with genetically divergent  C. hominis  populations.

        "abstract": "Abstract Several enteric microsporidia species have been detected in humans and other vertebrates and their identifications at the genotype level are currently being elucidated. As advanced methods, reagents, and disposal kits for detecting and identifying pathogens become commercially available, it is important to test them in settings other than in laboratories with state-of-the-art equipment and well-trained staff members. In the present study, we sought to detect microsporidia DNA preserved and extracted from FTA (fast technology analysis) cards spotted with human fecal suspensions obtained from Cameroonian volunteers living in the capital city of Yaounde to preclude the need for employing spore-concentrating protocols. Further, we tested whether amplicon nucleotide sequencing approaches could be used on small aliquots taken from the cards to elucidate the diversity of microsporidia species and strains infecting native residents. Of 196 samples analyzed, 12 (6.1%) were positive for microsporidia DNA; Enterocytozoon bieneusi (Type IV and KIN-1), Encephalitozoon cuniculi, and Encephalitozoon intestinalis were identified. These data demonstrate the utility of the FTA cards in identifying genotypes of microsporidia DNA in human fecal samples that may be applied to field testing for prevalence studies.",

        "abstract": "In pre-weaned dairy calves, the zoonotic and pathogenic species Cryptosporidium parvum is the dominant Cryptosporidium species in most industrialized nations. In several studies in China, however, C. bovis has been the dominant one. To further examine the distribution of Cryptosporidium species in pre-weaned dairy calves in China, 818 fecal specimens were collected from five farms in Shanghai, with repeated samplings (up to five times) on each farm. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the small subunit rRNA gene was used to detect and genotype Cryptosporidium spp. Cryptosporidium parvum was subtyped by sequence analysis of the 60kDa glycoprotein gene. Cryptosporidium occurrence on farms varied between 25.0% (Farm 2) and 55.0% (Farm 4), with a mean infection rate of 37.0%. Three Cryptosporidium species were detected, including C. bovis (193/303 or 63.7%), C. parvum (72/303 or 23.8%) and C. ryanae (32/303 or 10.6%). Concurrent infection of C. bovis and C. ryanae was detected in six (1.9%) animals. During the first two samplings, C. bovis was the dominant species on four farms and C. parvum was detected on only one farm (Farm 1). One of the study farms (Farm 3) started to have C. parvum at the third sampling. C. parvum was associated with the occurrence of moderate or watery diarrhea, while C. bovis was not. All C. parvum were subtype IIdA19G1, which is dominant in China but rare elsewhere. Genotyping and subtyping results indicated that the introduction of C. parvum to Farm 3 was caused by brief housing of several bull calves from another farm. Data from the study suggest that C. parvum is still uncommon in pre-weaned dairy calves in China and measures should be developed to prevent its spread in the country.",

        "abstract": "Giardia duodenalis is a common parasitic protozoan in human and animals. Epidemiological and molecular data are available from dairy cattle in many industrialized countries, but information on genetic diversity at multiple genetic loci is limited, especially in pre-weaned dairy calves. In this study, 818 fecal specimens were collected from five dairy cattle farms located in suburbs of Shanghai, China, with two to five samplings per farm. G. duodenalis assemblages and subtypes were determined using multilocus genotyping (MLG) at the \u03b2-giardin (bg), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) loci. The overall prevalence was 60.1% (492/818) combining data from the three genetic loci. Three G. duodenalis assemblages were detected, including E (n\u00a0=\u00a0482), A (n\u00a0=\u00a05), and B (n\u00a0=\u00a01), with the concurrence of A and E in a few animals (n\u00a0=\u00a04). Intra-genotypic sequence diversity was high for assemblage E, showing 12, 13, and 17 subtypes at the bg, gdh, and tpi loci, including four, six, and eight new subtypes, respectively. All dominant subtypes (E3, E2, and E8 at the bg locus; E1 and E3 at the gdh locus; and E11 and E3 at the tpi locus) were detected on all farms at most sampling occasions, and only limited differences in subtype distribution were observed among five farms. Altogether, 58 assemblage E MLGs were identified, all of which had not been reported before, and seven (MLG-E1-MLG-E7) were each seen on multiple farms. These results indicate a high occurrence of G. duodenalis in dairy calves, the existence of high genetic heterogeneity of assemblage E on five farms, and frequent exchange of parasite populations among farms within a small geographic area. The clinical and epidemiologic significance of these observations warrants further investigations.",

In this study, 495 fecal specimens from Tibetan sheep and 605 from yaks were collected from eight counties in Qinghai, China and analyzed for G. duodenalis by PCR targeting the \u03b2-giardin (bg), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) genes. Based on PCR positivity at the bg locus, G. duodenalis occurrence rates were 13.1% (65/495) in Tibetan sheep and 10.4% (63/605) in yaks. DNA sequence analysis identified the presence of G. duodenalis Assemblages A (in 10 Tibetan sheep and 2 yaks) and E (in 51 Tibetan sheep and 60 yaks). In addition, mixed infections of the two were identified in four Tibetan sheep and one yak. Among the sequences obtained in this study, 1, 10, and 2 new subtypes of Assemblage E were detected at the bg, gdh and tpi loci, respectively. Based on sequences from the three loci, 28 multilocus genotypes (MLGs) were obtained, including 27 MLGs in Assemblage E and one MLG in Assemblage A. Each MLG was found in no more than seven animals, with most MLGs forming host-specific clusters in phylogenetic analysis except for one cluster including MLGs from both Tibetan sheep and yaks. Only two MLGs were found in both sheep and yaks. The above results demonstrate a high subtype diversity of G. duodenalis Assemblage E in Tibetan sheep and yaks raised in a traditional animal husbandry system and suggest that only limited cross-species transmission of G. duodenalis occurs between yaks and sheep sharing pastures.",

        "abstract": "Fifteen dairy farms in seven states on the east coast of the US were each visited on two consecutive years to determinate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium species in pre-weaned (5 days to 2 months) and post-weaned calves (3\u201311 months), respectively. After each of 971 fecal specimens collected directly from each calf was sieved and subjected to density gradient centrifugation to remove debris and concentrate oocysts, specimens were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For all PCR-positive specimens the 18S rRNA gene of Cryptosporidium was sequenced. Cryptosporidium was identified from all farms. Types of housing appeared to have no influence with regard to prevalence of infection. Of 971 calves, 345 were infected with Cryptosporidium (35.5%), but more pre-weaned calves (253 of 503; 50.3%) than post-weaned calves (92 of 468; 19.7%) were found to be infected. A total of 278 PCR-positive specimens characterized by gene sequencing revealed Cryptosporidium parvum , Cryptosporidium andersoni , and two unnamed Cryptosporidium genotypes Bovine B ( AY120911 ) and deer-like genotype ( AY120910 ). The prevalence of these Cryptosporidium species and genotypes appeared to be age related between pre- and post-weaned calves. C. parvum , the only zoonotic species/genotype, constituted 85% of the Cryptosporidium infections in pre-weaned calves but only 1% of the Cryptosporidium infections in post-weaned calves. These findings clearly demonstrate that earlier reports on the presence and prevalence of C. parvum in post-weaned cattle that were based solely on oocyst morphology must be reassessed using molecular methods to validate species and genotype. This finding also indicates that persons handling or otherwise exposed to calves under 2 months of age are at greater risk of zoonotic infection from Cryptosporidium than the risk of infection from exposure to older calves.",

Because of the lack of typing targets, the genetic diversity and population genetics of C. cayetanensis have not been investigated. In this study, we undertook a population genetic analysis of multilocus sequence typing data we recently collected from 64 C. cayetanensis specimens. Despite the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the overall C. cayetanensis population, there were significant intra- and inter-genic linkage disequilibria (LD). A disappearance of LD was observed when only multilocus genotypes were included in the population genetic analysis, indicative of an epidemic nature of C. cayetanensis. Geographical segregation-associated sub-structuring was observed between specimens from China and those from Peru and the United States. The two subpopulations had reduced LD, indicating the likely occurrence of genetic exchange among isolates in endemic areas. Further analyses of specimens from other geographical regions are necessary to fully understand the population genetics of C. cayetanensis.",

Cryptosporidium is an extreme example of reductive evolution among apicomplexans, with losses of both the mitosome genome and many metabolic pathways. Previous observations on reductive evolution were largely based on comparative studies of various groups of apicomplexans. In this study, we sequenced two divergent Cryptosporidium species and conducted a comparative genomic analysis to infer the reductive evolution of metabolic pathways and differential evolution of invasion-related proteins within the Cryptosporidium lineage.",

To improve our understanding of the genetic basis of host adaptation in  Cryptosporidium parvum , we sequenced the genomes of two IId specimens and one IIa specimen from China and Egypt using the Illumina technique and compared them with the published IIa IOWA genome. Sequence data were obtained for u003e99.3% of the expected genome. Comparative genomic analysis identified differences in numbers of three subtelomeric gene families between sequenced genomes and the reference genome, including those encoding SKSR secretory proteins, the MEDLE family of secretory proteins, and insulinase-like proteases. These gene gains and losses compared with the reference genome were confirmed by PCR analysis. Altogether, 5,191\u20135,766 single nucleotide variants were seen between genomes sequenced in this study and the reference genome, with most SNVs occurring in subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 1, 4, and 6. The most highly polymorphic genes between IIa and IId encode mainly invasion-associated and immunodominant mucin proteins, and other families of secretory proteins. Further studies are needed to verify the biological significance of these genomic differences.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium spp. are important causes of diarrhea in humans, ruminants, and other mammals. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that genetically related and host-adapted Cryptosporidium species have different numbers of subtelomeric genes encoding the Cryptosporidium-specific MEDLE family of secreted proteins, which could contribute to differences in host specificity. In this study, a Cryptosporidium parvum-specific member of the protein family MEDLE-2 encoded by cgd5_4590 was cloned and expressed in E. coli. Immunofluorescent staining with antibodies generated from the recombinant protein showed the expression of the protein in sporozoites and development stages. In vitro neutralization assay with the antibodies partially blocked the invasion of sporozoites. These results support the potential involvement of MEDLE-2 in the invasion of host cells.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium parvum is an intracellular protozoan that can cause severe diarrhea in humans and various mammals. Results of a comparative genomic analysis indicated that genes encoding two C. parvum-specific insulinase-like proteases (INS19 and INS20), cgd6_5510 and cgd6_5520, are lost in many Cryptosporidium species. In this study, we provided evidence indicating that cgd6_5510 and cgd6_5520 are fragments of a full gene (cgd6_5520-5510) encoding one insulinase-like protease (INS20-19) that is similar in structure to classic insulinases. We expressed cgd6_5510 in Escherichia coli for antiserum preparation, and found the protein (INS19) was partially degraded. A ~180 kDa protein of INS20-19 was specifically recognized by the polyclonal anti-INS19 antiserum in sporozoite lysate. We observed that INS20-19 is likely a protein with high expression in the apical region of sporozoites, and neutralization of the protein led to a partial reduction of parasite load in HCT-8 and MDBK cell cultures at 24 h. Taken together, our findings support the involvement of INS20-19 in the invasion or early developmental process of C. parvum.",

In this study, 280 fecal specimens were collected from 132 diarrheic lambs and 148 diarrheic goat kids aged 4 to 15\u202fdays on 15 farms in northern Greece, and examined for Cryptosporidium spp. using microscopy of Ziehl-Neelsen-stained fecal smears. Cryptosporidium spp. in 80 microscopy-positive fecal specimens (39 from lambs and 41 from goat kids) were genotyped by PCR-RFLP analysis of the small subunit rRNA gene and subtyped by sequence analysis the 60\u202fkDa glycoprotein gene. Among the 33 specimens successfully genotyped, C. parvum was found in 32 and C. xiaoi in one. Seven subtypes belonging to two subtype families (IIa and IId) were identified among the 29 C. parvum specimens successfully subtyped, including IIaA14G2R1 (1/29), IIaA15G2R1 (6/29), IIaA20G1R1 (7/29), IIdA14G2 (1/29), IIdA15G1 (9/29), IIdA16G1 (3/29), and IIdA23G1 (2/29). Lambs were more commonly infected with C. parvum IIa subtypes, whereas goat kids were more with IId subtypes. The results illustrate that C. parvum is prevalent in diarrheic lambs and goat kids in northern Greece and these animals could potentially play a role in epidemiology of human cryptosporidiosis.",

Altogether, 292 diarrheic 4-15-day-old goat kids from 54 dairy goat herds of Northern Greece were examined. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. were detected in 223 of 292 (76.4%) goat kids and the intensity of infection was scored as \"high\" in 142 samples, \"moderate\" in 45 samples, and \"low\" in 36 samples. Larger herds (>200 animals) had higher infection rates than smaller ones, although this difference was not statistically significant. Significantly higher infection rates were observed in herds during late kidding season (1 January to 30 April) compared to the early one (1 September to 31 December). These results suggest that cryptosporidiosis is very common in diarrheic goat kids in Greece, especially in large herds during the late parturition season.",

Despite their importance to public health, epidemiological data on foodborne diseases including giardiasis caused by the enteric parasite,  Giardia duodenalis,  are lacking. This parasite is estimated to cause \u223c28.2 million cases of diarrhoea each year due to contamination of food, but very few foodborne outbreaks have been documented due to the limitations of current detection as well as surveillance methods. The current method for the recovery of  Giardia  cysts from food matrices using immunomagnetic separation requires further standardisation and cost reduction before it can be widely used. It also should incorporate downstream molecular procedures for genotyping, and traceback and viability analyses. Foodborne giardiasis can be potentially controlled through improvements in national disease surveillance systems and the establishment of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point interventions across the food chain. Studies are needed to assess the true prevalence and public health impact of foodborne giardiasis.",

        "title": "Outbreaks Associated with Treated Recreational Water - United States, 2000-2014.",
        "abstract": "Outbreaks associated with exposure to treated recreational water can be caused by pathogens or chemicals in venues such as pools, hot tubs/spas, and interactive water play venues (i.e., water playgrounds). During 2000-2014, public health officials from 46 states and Puerto Rico reported 493 outbreaks associated with treated recreational water. These outbreaks resulted in at least 27,219 cases and eight deaths. Among the 363 outbreaks with a confirmed infectious etiology, 212 (58%) were caused by Cryptosporidium (which causes predominantly gastrointestinal illness), 57 (16%) by Legionella (which causes Legionnaires' disease, a severe pneumonia, and Pontiac fever, a milder illness with flu-like symptoms), and 47 (13%) by Pseudomonas (which causes folliculitis [\"hot tub rash\"] and otitis externa [\"swimmers' ear\"]). Investigations of the 363 outbreaks identified 24,453 cases; 21,766 (89%) were caused by Cryptosporidium, 920 (4%) by Pseudomonas, and 624 (3%) by Legionella. At least six of the eight reported deaths occurred in persons affected by outbreaks caused by Legionella. Hotels were the leading setting, associated with 157 (32%) of the 493 outbreaks. Overall, the outbreaks had a bimodal temporal distribution: 275 (56%) outbreaks started during June-August and 46 (9%) in March. Assessment of trends in the annual counts of outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium, Legionella, or Pseudomonas indicate mixed progress in preventing transmission. Pathogens able to evade chlorine inactivation have become leading outbreak etiologies. The consequent outbreak and case counts and mortality underscore the utility of CDC's Model Aquatic Health Code (https://www.cdc.gov/mahc) to prevent outbreaks associated with treated recreational water.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis is a nationally notifiable gastrointestinal illness caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus Cryptosporidium, which can cause profuse, watery diarrhea that can last up to 2-3 weeks in immunocompetent patients and can lead to life-threatening wasting and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients. Fecal-oral transmission of Cryptosporidium oocysts, the parasite's infectious life stage, occurs via ingestion of contaminated recreational water, drinking water, or food, or following contact with infected persons or animals, particularly preweaned bovine calves (1). The typical incubation period is 2-10 days. Since 2004, the annual incidence of nationally notified cryptosporidiosis has risen approximately threefold in the United States (1). Cryptosporidium also has emerged as the leading etiology of nationally notified recreational water-associated outbreaks, particularly those associated with aquatic facilities (i.e., physical places that contain one or more aquatic venues [e.g., pools] and support infrastructure) (2). As of February 24, 2017, a total of 13 (54%) of 24 states reporting provisional data detected at least 32 aquatic facility-associated cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in 2016. In comparison, 20 such outbreaks were voluntarily reported to CDC via the National Outbreak Reporting System for 2011, 16 for 2012, 13 for 2013, and 16 for 2014. This report highlights cryptosporidiosis outbreaks associated with aquatic facilities in three states (Alabama, Arizona, and Ohio) in 2016. This report also illustrates the use of CryptoNet, the first U.S. molecularly based surveillance system for a parasitic disease, to further elucidate Cryptosporidium chains of transmission and cryptosporidiosis epidemiology. CryptoNet data can be used to optimize evidence-based prevention strategies. Not swimming when ill with diarrhea is key to preventing and controlling aquatic facility-associated cryptosporidiosis outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/swimmers/steps-healthy-swimming.html).",

        "abstract": "Microsporidia comprise a large class of unicellular eukaryotic pathogens that are medically and agriculturally important, but poorly understood. There have been nearly 1,500 microsporidian species described thus far, which are variable in biology, genetics, genomics, and host specificity. Among those,  is the well-known species responsible for the most recorded cases of human microsporidian affections. The pathogen can colonize a broad range of mammals and birds and most of the animals surveyed share some genotypes with humans, posing a threat to public health. Based on DNA sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and phylogenetic analysis, several hundreds of  genotypes have been defined and clustered into different genetic groups with varied levels of host specificity. However, single locus-based typing using ITS might have insufficient resolution to discriminate among  isolates with complex genetic or hereditary characteristics and to assess the elusive reproduction or transmission modes of the organism, highlighting the need for exploration and application of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and population genetic tools. The present review begins with a primer on microsporidia and major microsporidian species, briefly introduces the recent advances on  ITS genotyping and phylogeny, summarizes recent MLST and population genetic data, analyzes the inter- and intragroup host specificity at the MLST level, and interprets the public health implications of host specificity in zoonotic or cross-species transmission of this ubiquitous fungus.",

        "abstract": "Solid solution CeO 2 -MO x (M=La 3+ , Ca 2+ ) promoted Pd/ \u03b3 -Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method. The structural properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that M n + ions incorporated into CeO 2 lattice and solid solutions formed in Pd/ \u03b3 -Al 2 O 3 -CeO 2 -MO x catalysts. The formation of solid solution was confirmed by the change in lattice parameters of CeO 2 and the shift of 2\u03b8 angles as compared with pure CeO 2 . A strain formed in the O 2\u2212 sub-lattice of CeO 2 was revealed by Raman analyses, which decreased the intensity of the Raman-active band at around 463 cm \u22121 owing to the F 2 g symmetric stretching of Ce\u2212O bond. The appearance of a new band at 615 cm \u22121 (in the case of Pd/ \u03b3 -Al 2 O 3 -CeO 2 -CaO) and a shoulder at 320 cm \u22121 (in the case of Pd/ \u03b3 -Al 2 O 3 -CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 ) was also confirmed. Ionic Pd \u03b4 + species were formed in the catalysts, which exhibited higher binding energies (0.5\u22120.6 eV higher for Pd 3 d 5/2 ) than that of normal PdO. The catalysts showed high activity and stability for low temperature methane combustion. 10% and 100% conversions of methane could be obtained at temperatures of 254 and 340 \u00b0C, respectively, over Pd/ \u03b3 -Al 2 O 3 -CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalyst under an hourly space velocity of 50000 h \u22121 .",

The results demonstrated that Pd/\u03b3-Al2O3CeO2 MOx catalysts can be effective for the low-temperature catalytic combustion of methane and are comparable in activity to other conventional catalysts for this reaction. The XPS and XRD results indicated that an enhanced mobility of lattice oxygen induced by the perturbation of Ce-O lattice was responsible for an increased catalytic performance during oxidation reaction.

        "abstract": "Solid solution CeO2-MOx (M=La3+, Ca 2+) promoted Pd/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method. The structural properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that Mn+ ions incorporated into CeO2 lattice and solid solutions formed in Pd/\u03b3-Al 2O3-CeO2-MOx catalysts. The formation of solid solution was confirmed by the change in lattice parameters of CeO2 and the shift of 2\u03b8 angles as compared with pure CeO 2. A strain formed in the O2- sub-lattice of CeO 2 was revealed by Raman analyses, which decreased the intensity of the Raman-active band at around 463 cm-1 owing to the F2g symmetric stretching of Ce-O bond. The appearance of a new band at 615 cm -1 (in the case of Pd/\u03b3-Al2O3-CeO 2-CaO) and a shoulder at 320 cm-1 (in the case of Pd/\u03b3-Al2O3-CeO2-La2O 3) was also confirmed. Ionic Pd\u03b4+ species were formed in the catalysts, which exhibited higher binding energies (0.5-0.6 eV higher for Pd 3d5/2) than that of normal PdO. The catalysts showed high activity and stability for low temperature methane combustion. 10% and 100% conversions of methane could be obtained at temperatures of 254 and 340\u00b0C, respectively, over Pd/\u03b3-Al2O3-CeO 2-La2O3 catalyst under an hourly space velocity of 50000 h-1. \u00a9 Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.",

        "abstract": "It is known that certain individuals remain persistently seronegative despite repeated exposure to HIV-1. Studies have shown that some exposed uninfected (EU) individuals who are homozygous for a 32-bp deletion in the CCR5 gene are resistant to infection with non-syncytium-inducing (R5) viruses. In the present investigation, we provide evidence that a highly exposed-uninfected individual with the CCR5 32-bp deletion (EUdelta32-1) also has partial resistance to syncytium-inducing (R5X4) HIV-1 viruses, when compared with unexposed-uninfected individuals with (UUdelta32-1 and UUdelta32-2) and without (UU-1 and UU-2) the 32-bp deletion. The partial resistance of EU cells was due neither to altered coreceptor expression, nor to specific mutation or deletion in the coding region of chemokine coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR3. While SDF-1, the ligand for CXCR4, blocked entry of R5X4 viruses to a similar extent in EUdelta32 and UUdelta32, there was a differential production of soluble factors by EUdelta32. Both CD4+ and CD8+ cells from EUdelta32-1 produced soluble factors that efficiently suppressed infection by HIV-1 R5X4 viruses when compared with supernatant from UUdelta32. These data provide evidence that additional soluble factors are involved in resistance to infection with R5X4 viruses.",

The calculated structural parameters for KB 6  are consistent with previously reported experimental results. The calculated absorption spectrum shows that KB 6  is a promising near-infrared absorbing material. By combining the calculated reflectivity spectra and the calculated absorption spectra, the theoretical transmittance of compacted and coated films of KB 6  is determined. These calculations reveal that KB 6  could serve as a perfect solar radiation shielding material with high visible light transmittance.",

Construction of contact-potential barrier, formation and rupture of a localized conduction filaments and migration of oxygen vacancy existed in the interface near electrodes co-contribute to the enhanced RS memory effects, but the migration of Ag + , Ni 2 x +  and diffusion of oxygen vacancies are the dominated ones.

        "abstract": "Despite the initial evidence on the role of zinc and zinc transporters in cancer prevention, little attention has been paid to the zinc-derived compounds. In the present work, we reported a strategy to prepare a kind of zinc-releasing container with enhanced biocompatibility and release dynamics using ZIF-8 nanocrystals as the sacrificial templates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis demonstrated that the ZIF-8 nanocrystals were gradually etched out in the aqueous media within 48 h, resulting in hollow nanocapsules. Notably, we found the self-polymerization of dopamine can form nanoshells around the ZIF-8 nanocrystals, which served as a type of functional membranes during the release of zinc. More interestingly, PDA@ZIF-8\u207bbased nanohybrids expressed stronger inhibition to the cancer cell growth, which implied that the nanohybrids could be a drug carrier for chemotherapy. This study broadens the biomedical application of ZIF-8 and also provides a versatile strategy toward the development of multifunctional delivery system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nickel titanate (NiTiO 3 ) is a bimetallic oxide with potential applications in solar heat shielding coatings. Most prior researches have focused on the photocatalytic behavior of NiTiO 3  but are limited to explore on reflective performance. In the paper, NiTiO 3  ultrafine nanopowders were synthesized by the sol-gel method. Thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and UV\u2013Vis-NIR-DR spectro-photometry were employed to investigate the structural and optical properties of samples at different treatment temperatures. The average crystal size of synthesized NiTiO 3  powder in 500\u2013900\u202f\u00b0C regions was found to be 13.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02\u201380.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.06\u202fnm. Ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis) near infrared (NIR) diffuse reflectance spectra study showed that synthesized at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fh NiTiO 3  nanoparticles showed higher solar reflection of 40.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04% in the NIR region (700\u20132500\u202fnm) than other temperature samples according to particular computational formulation with experimental results. The solar reflective ability in the NIR region of NiTiO 3  powders was found to be decrease as treatment temperature increased. Temperature higher than 700\u202f\u00b0C, results showed further crystallization of NiTiO 3 , due to Ni 2+  ion d-d transitions ( 3 A 2g \u202f\u2192\u202f 3 T lg (P)) and transfer of amorphous NiTiO 3  structure to an ilmenite structure. These results indicate that when annealing temperature is increased the microstructure and crystal size of NiTiO 3  powders are altered and the performance of optical reflection is changed.",

Its potential for use as a transparent energy-saving filter was evaluated using theoretical optical results. The results showed that Cs0.33WO3 exhibits excellent near-infrared radiation reflectance/absorption and high transmissivity of visible light, so it is ideal for use as a solar radiative filter for windows. In addition, Cs0.33WO3 provides perfect solar radiation shielding, suggesting that this material could be applied for compacted filters and nanoparticle-dispersed coatings. Two types of Cs0.33WO3 filters exhibited more than 80% transmissivity of visible light and excellent solar radiation shielding performance. This research work indicates that the doping of the Cs ion into hex-WO3 induces a persistent n-type electronic conductivity with metal-like characteristics and dramatically enhances near-infrared radiation absorption while maintaining excellent visible light transparency.",

The band structure, the density of states, and the optical properties of rutile VO2 were calculated using the first-principles calculations. The calculated results of the structural and optical properties are in good agreement with the previously reported experimental findings.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Bayer red mud (BRM), generally containing 0.002\u00a0wt%\u20130.008\u00a0wt% of gallium (Ga), is an overlooked resource of Ga. In this work, an efficient method, called acidic-leaching-ion-exchange process (ALIEP), was developed to extract Ga from BRM. The ALIEP method involved three main steps: the BRM sample was firstly dissolved by mineral acid and the obtained leaching solution was further purified to remove the Fe 3\u00a0+ . Consequently, the purified solution, pre-concentrated by re-circulation process, was efficiently treated by ion-exchange process for the Ga recovery. The main influencing factors of the acidic-leaching process were systematically investigated. The optimal Ga leaching conditions were determined as HCl 159\u00a0g/L, liquid-to-solid ratio of 8\u00a0mL/g, 55\u00a0\u00b0C, and 5\u00a0h, attaining Ga leaching rate of 94.77% and the corresponding Ga 3\u00a0+  concentration of 3.91\u00a0mg/L in leachate. A nearly complete iron removal from the leachate was achieved by employing LSD-396 resin under conditions of 45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C, resin dosage of 0.6\u00a0g/mL and 2\u00a0h. Subsequently, the recovery efficiency of Ga from re-circulation leaching solution using the ion-exchange technology was evaluated. The results indicated that an adsorption rate of 59.84% and desorption rate of 95.32% for Ga were obtained. The concentrated solution contained 97.54\u00a0mg/L of Ga, which was enriched 24.95 and 4.75 times compared to the initial leaching solution of 3.91\u00a0mg/L and re-circulation solution of 20.52\u00a0mg/L, respectively.",

        "abstract": "First-principles density functional theory was used to investigate the electronic structure, optical properties and the origin of the near-infrared (NIR) absorption of covellite (CuS). The calculated lattice constant and optical properties are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental and theoretical findings. The electronic structure reveals that the valence and conduction bands of covellite are determined by the Cu 3d and S 3p states. By analyzing its optical properties, we can fully understand the potential of covellite (CuS) as a NIR absorbing material. Our results show that covellite (CuS) exhibits NIR absorption due to its metal-like plasma oscillation in the NIR range.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Gallium (Ga) is extensively employed in integrated circuits and advanced electronic devices as it provides the benefits of low energy consumption and high computation speeds. However, the Ga-bearing host minerals are scarce in nature. Ga occurs in combination with several minerals, mainly including aluminum, zinc, iron ores and coals, of which bauxite, zinc ores and coals are the primary original sources of Ga currently. Mining minerals for the sole extraction of Ga is not economical due to the low concentration of Ga. Accordingly, Ga is mainly recovered as a by-product from the processing of minerals. The current main commercial resources of Ga are Bayer liquor and zinc residue, which contribute to nearly all of the worldwide Ga production. The production of low-grade (99.99% pure) Ga has been increasing at an average rate of 7.4% p.a. for the past four decades and amounted to 375\u00a0tons in 2016. It is estimated to increase by 20-fold by the year 2030 compared to the yield of 275\u00a0tons in 2012. The mounting worldwide demand for Ga necessitates the search for additional resources and recovery technologies for this particular element. Apart from the Bayer liquor and the zinc residue, there are several other Ga-resources, which include red mud, coal fly ash, Ga-bearing electronics industrial waste, and flue dust from electric furnaces at phosphorus factories. Based on the chemical properties of Ga, it is evident that both strong acidic/basic conditions and high temperatures favor the efficient extraction of Ga from its corresponding minerals. Several hydrometallurgical processes based mainly on acid/alkaline leaching along with solution purification and recovery (e.g. ion exchange, solvent extraction and precipitation) have been proposed for Ga extraction from these resources. In this paper, the current status of Ga recovery was reviewed and specific examples were utilized for each resource to discuss the extraction methods, the recoveries and the optimum Ga-recovery conditions for each resource. Additional research appears to be necessary to establish a highly efficient and environmentally friendly process to recover Ga from these resources.",

We have successfully developed an optimal synthesis system which allows for a single hydrothermal oxidation directly synthesizing IATO nanoparticles without high-temperature calcination. These nanoparticles show superior size, crystallinity, agglomeration and are free of intermediates In(OH) 3  and InOOH. We also have demonstrated they give scope to desired optical property as a result of an altered IATO band gap energy.  We highlight this approach due to the shortened preparation time, the reduced energy consumption and the decreased chemical usage which dramatically save on production costs and protect environment.",

On the first farm, all nine diarrheic calves sampled once in June had Giardia cysts in their feces. On the second farm, all five diarrheic calves examined at the beginning of the diarrhea outbreak in March had Giardia infection. When resampled, the overall infection rate of normal and diarrheic calves was 82.4% in April, and 40.0% in August after the diarrhea subsided. Positive calves ranged from 11 to 164 days of age, and 22.2% of them were as young as 1 to 3 weeks of age. Eight of nine diarrheic calves (88.8%) on the first farm had Cryptosporidium infection. Lower infection rates (< 30%) were found on the second farm. Six of 10 positive calves were 11-22 days old, three were 164-177 days old, and one was 71 days old. Five of these 10 positive calves were also positive for Giardia infection. Five diarrheic calves on the northern Ohio farm and one diarrheic calf on the central Ohio farm were treated with metronidazole after failing to respond to antibiotic therapy. Clinical improvement was observed in all calves within 48 h after the start of treatment. The high Giardia infection rates and intensities in calves of a wide age range and the clinical response to metronidazole suggest that Giardia infection contributed to the outbreaks of diarrhea.",

They were Scheloribates laevigatus (Scheloribatidae), Exoribatula sp. cf. biundatus (Scheloribatidae), Xylobates capucinus (Haplozetidae) and Zygoribatula undulata (Oribatulidae) from Ohio, and Galumna ithacensis (Galumnidae) and Scheloribates lanceoliger (Scheloribatidae) from Georgia. Cysticercoids were also recovered from S. laevigatus infected with M. expansa. Among the six species of mites, S. laevigatus is the major intermediate host of M. expansa and M. benedeni worldwide, while the other five species have not been previously reported as transmitters of Moniezia spp. This is also the first report of any species from the genera Exoribatula and Xylobates as intermediate hosts of tapeworms. Different species of oribatid mites varied in their efficiency as intermediate hosts of M. benedeni. Moniezia benedeni had higher infection rate and infection intensity in S. laevigatus than in other species. Development in S. laevigatus was also more rapid than in the other species. Mite size was only one of the determinants of intermediate host efficiency. Storage at 4 degrees C for 1 to 5 weeks reduced the viability of M. benedeni eggs. Stored eggs had lower infection rates and infection intensity and slower development in S. laevigatus. They also had lower infection rates in X. capucinus and Exoribatula sp. cf. biundatus.",

        "title": "Molecular Epidemiology of Giardia, Blastocystis and Cryptosporidium among Indigenous Children from the Colombian Amazon Basin",
        "abstract": "The incidence and prevalence of intestinal parasites in children is most likely due to lack of natural or acquired resistance and differences in behavior and habits closely related to environmental and socioeconomic determinants. The most important protozoa that parasitize humans are Giardia, Entamoeba, Blastocystis and Cryptosporidium. These parasites present wide intraspecific genetic diversity and subsequently classified into assemblages and subtypes. The Amazon basin is the largest in the world and is the fifth freshwater reserve on the planet. Contradictorily, people living in these areas (Indigenous populations) have poor quality of life, which favors the infection of diseases of fecal-oral transmission. The aim of this work was to unravel the molecular epidemiology of Giardia, Blastocystis and Cryptosporidium across four communities (Puerto Narino, San Juan del Soco, Villa Andrea and Nuevo Paraiso). We obtained 284 fecal samples from children under 15 years old that were analyzed by direct microscopy (261 samples) and Real Time PCR (qPCR) (284 samples). The positive samples for these protozoa were further characterized by several molecular markers to depict assemblages and subtypes. We observed a frequency of Giardia infection by microscopy of 23.7% (62 samples) and by qPCR of 64.8% (184 samples); for Blastocystis by microscopy of 35.2% (92 samples) and by qPCR of 88.7% (252 samples) and for Cryptosporidium only 1.9% (5 samples) were positive by microscopy and qPCR 1.8% (5 samples). Regarding the Giardia assemblages, using the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) marker we observed AI, BIII and BIV assemblages and when using triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) we observed assemblages AI, AII, BIII and BIV. In contrast, Blastocystis STs detected were 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Lastly, the species C. viatorum, C. hominis (with the subtypes IdA19 and IaA12R8) and C. parvum (with the subtype IIcA5G3c) were identified. We observed a high profile of zoonotic transmission regarding the Giardia assemblages and Blastocystis STs/alleles. Also, we highlight the elevated frequency of infection by these two protozoans suggesting an active transmission in the area. Our findings reinforces the need to deploy better epidemiological surveillance systems for enteric pathogens in the area.",

        "abstract": "The infrared absorption spectrum due to structural vibrations in molecules has been widely used to resolve chemical identification. However, this method is limited by the weak molecule-light interaction. Graphene plasmon, having strong confinement and large field enhancement, provides a promising way to increase their interactions. Here we propose tunable hybridization-induced graphene nanostructures for sensing application. Our results reveal that when the symmetry of the graphene disk is broken by introducing a small circular defect, dual-band resonance can be excited at mid-infrared frequencies. The dual-band resonance peaks are produced by plasmon hybridization effect between two simple structures: graphene disks and circular defects. We investigate the influence of the size and position of the circular defect on the dual-band resonance peaks. We further explore the dual-band resonance peaks for sensing, and the sensitivity can reach 550 cm\u22121/RIU and the FOM can reach 20.4. Compared to the original graphene disk structure, the results show stronger resonance intensity and higher frequency sensitivity. Our findings provide a new platform for sensing, and moreover the dual-band resonance structure feature enables us to promote the development of multi-substance detection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Graphene has become an ideal material in terahertz domain due to its linear band-structure and extraordinary carrier transport properties as well as the variable carrier density which can be modified by bias voltage. A high-performance modulator based on double-layer graphene was proposed here which was composed of graphene\u2013silica\u2013silicon\u2013silica\u2013graphene five layers. The equivalent circuit method was used to calculate its 3dB bandwidth, modulation speed, insertion loss and modulation depth. The results show its 3dB bandwidth is approximately 264\u00a0KHz, the modulation speed can reach 151\u00a0KHz and insertion loss is about 0.3\u00a0dB. The modulator was fabricated by chemical vapor deposition method and measured using terahertz-time domain spectroscopy system which was produced by Zomega Terahertz company of America. The experimental results show a best measured modulation depth of 61% can be achieved with a bias voltage of 32\u00a0V. The proposed modulator here has many advantages such as fast modulation rate, high modulation depth, wide bandwidth as well as easy to fabricate which provides an effective method to the terahertz communications and imaging systems.",

        "abstract": "Cutting temperature always highly reaches over to 1000\u2103 when high speed machining with PCBN tools. Diffusion of tool material element may have important influence on tool wear at such high temperature, the diffusion wear and oxidation wear have become the major wear mechanism. In this paper, the rules of diffusion wear and oxidation wear for PCBN cutting tools are proposed and analyzed based on thermodynamics theory. Dissolution concentrations in typical normal workplace materials of PCBN tool material at different temperature are then calculated. Diffusion reaction rules in high temperature are developed and analyzed using Gibbs free energy criterion. The machining tests were conducted using the PCBN tools at different cutting speeds of 50, 95, 100 and 180 m/min, feed of 0.1, 0.2 and depth of cut of 0.1, 0.8, 1, and 1.5 mm respectively on PUMA300LM numerically-controlled lathe. It was found that the theoretical results were uniform with the experimental data; the results will provide useful references for tool material design and selection.",
