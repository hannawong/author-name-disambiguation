        "abstract": "Nanodiamonds (NDs) possess many excellent physical and chemical properties that make them attractive materials for applications in biomedicine. In this paper, the adsorption and delivery of a large amount of sodium ions into the cell interior by NDs in serum-free medium is demonstrated. The excess sodium ions inside the cells induce osmotic stresses followed by cell swelling and an increase in the intracellular levels of calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to severe cellular damage. In complete culture medium, however, serum proteins wrapped around the NDs effectively prevent the sodium ions from adsorbing onto the NDs, and thus the NDs show no cytotoxicity. This work is the first to elaborate on the correlation between the sodium ions adsorbed on the nanomaterials and their bio-effects. Excessive ions delivered into cells by NDs might have potential applications in tumor therapy.",

        "abstract": "Graphene is a single layer of sp(2)-bonded carbons that has unique and highly attractive electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties. Consequently, the potential impact of graphene and its derivatives (e.g., graphene oxide, GO) on human and environmental health has raised considerable concerns. In this study, we have carried out a systematic investigation on cellular effects of GO nanosheets and identified the effect of fetal bovine serum (FBS), an often-employed component in cell culture medium, on the cytotoxicity of GO. At low concentrations of FBS (1%), human cells were sensitive to the presence of GO and showed concentration-dependent cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity of GO was greatly mitigated at 10% FBS, the concentration usually employed in cell medium. Our studies have demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of GO nanosheets arises from direct interactions between the cell membrane and GO nanosheets that result in physical damage to the cell membrane. This effect is largely attenuated when GO is incubated with FBS due to the extremely high protein adsorption ability of GO. The observation of this FBS-mitigated GO cytotoxicity effect may provide an alternative and convenient route to engineer nanomaterials for safe biomedical and environmental applications.",

Here, we designed a DNA-directed programmable assembly strategy to fabricate a halo-like Au nanostructure (nanohalo) that couples plasmonic large gold nanoparticles (L-AuNPs) with catalytically active small AuNPs (S-AuNPs) in a single nanoarchitecture. Catalytic reaction occurring on S-AuNPs changes its permittivity, which results in a significant variation of the plasmonic resonance of the nanohalo. Hence, we can indirectly monitor catalytic reactions on a single nanohalo under DFM, on the basis of which we have obtained quantitative information on both nanocatalysis and catalyst poisoning. Our study thus provides a cost-effective means to quantitatively study metal NP-based catalysis at single-particle level.",

In the meanwhile, the biosafety of nanoparticles has also raised intense concerns worldwide. To address such concerns, great efforts have been made to examine short-term effects of nanoparticles on cell survival and proliferation. More recently, exploration of long-term effects of nanomaterials, particularly those with promising biomedical applications in vivo, has aroused significant interest. For example, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are generally considered non-toxic to cell growth, whereas recent studies suggest that AuNPs might have long-term effects on cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis. In this Review, recent advances in this direction are summarized. Further, possible mechanisms under which nanoparticles regulate metabolic signaling pathways, potential long-term effects on cellular anabolic or catabolic processes, and their implications in human health and metabolic disorders are discussed.",

A key step to address this issue is to understand their underlying growth mechanism, which is often entangled in the complexity of growth environments and obscured by rapid reaction speeds. Herein, we demonstrate that the evolution of size, surface morphology, and the optical properties of gold plasmonic nanostructures could be quantitatively intercepted by dynamic and stoichiometric control of the DNA-mediated growth. By combining synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we reliably obtained quantitative structural parameters for these fine nanostructures that correlate well with their optical properties as identified by UV/Vis absorption and dark-field scattering spectroscopy. Through this comprehensive study, we report a growth mechanism for gold plasmonic nanostructures, and the first semiquantitative revelation of the remarkable interplay between their morphology and unique plasmonic properties.",

We concluded that GO of \u223c200 nm (lateral nanometer size) possessed the highest fluorescence quenching efficiency whereas GO of \u223c40 nm demonstrated much weaker ability to quench the fluorescence. We employed the nanometer size effect of GO to program the dynamic ranges and sensitivity of mercury sensors. Three dynamic ranges (1 to 40 nM, 1 to 15 nM, and 0.1 to 5 nM) were obtained with this size modulation.

        "abstract": "We determined the distribution and biocompatibility of graphene oxide (GO) in mice by using radiotracer technique and a series of biological assays. Results showed that GO was predominantly deposited in the lungs, where it was retained for a long time. Compared with other carbon nanomaterials, GO exhibited long blood circulation time (half-time 5.3 \u00b1 1.2 h), and low uptake in reticuloendothelial system. No pathological changes were observed in examined organs when mice were exposed to 1 mg kg \u22121 body weight of GO for 14 days. Moreover, GO showed good biocompatibility with red blood cells. These results suggested that GO might be a promising material for biomedical applications, especially for targeted drug delivery to the lung. However, due to its high accumulation and long time retention, significant pathological changes, including inflammation cell infiltration, pulmonary edema and granuloma formation were found at the dosage of 10 mg kg \u22121 body weight. More attention should be paid to the toxicity of GO. 1 Introduction Since its isolation in 2004 [1] , graphene has attracted tremendous attention due to its unique electronic, thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Intensive research is ongoing to investigate the quantum physics in this system and potential applications for nanoelectronic devices, transparent conductors, and composite materials [2\u20139] . Recent studies have showed that GO was useful for biomedical applications, such as drug/gene delivery, biosensing and bioimaging [10\u201319] . In particular, the potential use of GO as targeted drug delivery vehicle for cancer therapy has attracted considerable interest. Dai and colleagues first demonstrated that GO functionalized with polyethylene glycol was able to delivery aromatic, water-insoluble anticancer drugs into cells, and their intrinsic optical properties were also used for cell imaging [10,11] . Immediately after that, Chen et al. showed that doxorubicin hydrochloride (DXR) could efficiently load onto GO by a simple noncovalent method, the loading ratio of GO could reach 200%, much higher than that of other nanocarriers [12] . They also reported that GO could be modified with magnetic nanoparticle to yield GO based composite, which could move regularly in magnetic field, suggesting that GO may be useful in targeted drug delivery [13] . More recently, Zhang and coworkers reported that GO co-loaded with the two anticancer drugs (doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin (CPT)) showed specific targeting to MCF-7 cells, and exhibited remarkably high cytotoxicity when compared to GO loaded with either DOX or CPT only [14] . Moreover, GO was highly physiologically stable and showed excellent biocompatibility to various cells and bacteria [20\u201323] . Thus it appears that GO may be a promising candidate like fullerene (C 60 ), carbon nanotubes (CNT), and nanodiamonds (ND) for biomedical applications [10,11,24] . In order to investigate the usefulness of GO in biomedical fields, the experimental information about its adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) is urgently needed. Due to the lack of suitable detection method, little is known about the biological behavior of GO in vitro , and no reports have focused on the distribution of GO in vivo thus far. Radioactive tracing technique, however, with advantages of high sensitivity, credibility and freedom from interference, has become an excellent approach to obtain information on ADME of nanomaterials in vivo . Since 99m Tc labeling of the fullerenol by Li et al. in 2002 [25] , numerous studies have been reported on radiolabeling of a variety of carbon nanomaterials (CNM), including C 60 derivatives [26] , single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) [27\u201329] , multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNCT) [30,31] , and ND [32,33] . The goal of this study was to determine the distribution and pharmacokinetic profiles of GO in mice, and evaluate its biocompatibility with target organs and red blood cells (RBC). Herein, the tissue distribution and clearance of Rhenium ( 188 Re)-GO in mice was determined through an effective and convenient radiotracer technique. Based on the distribution characteristics, its biocompatibility with target organs and RBC was evaluated by a serial of biological assays. The results suggested that 188 Re\u2013GO with excellent radiochemical purity and stability is highly suitable for the study of ADME behavior of GO in vivo . The relative long blood circulation half time of GO as well as its excellent biocompatibility with target organs and RBC could be beneficial in use of GO for biomedical applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address this issue. And we believed this study will contribute significantly to better understanding the toxicity of GO in vivo and will encourage the development of GO in biomedical fields in the near future. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Reagents and animals 188 Re was obtained from an alumina-based 188 W/ 188 Re generator (Shanghai Ke-Xing Pharmaceutical Co.); loaded with the 188 W solution supplied by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Oak Ridge, TN). GO was prepared by a modified Hummers method and characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy [34] . All the other chemicals used were of analytical grade, obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Kun Ming mice (Sprague\u2013Dawley rats) were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd., China. The animals were housed in plastic cages, fed a commercial diet, and given water ad libitum. All animals were checked for the absence of infection for 1 week prior to experiment. Permission of the local ethics committee was obtained, and all animal experiments were performed according to Chinese law and accepted international standards in biomedical research. 2.2 Labeling of GO with 188 Re The radiolabeling of GO was performed by a conventional reduction method based on our previous report [33] . Briefly, 1 mL of GO (1 mg mL \u22121 ), 50 \u03bcl ascorbic acid (40 mg mL \u22121 ), 70 \u03bcl stannous chloride (60 mg mL \u22121 ), and 1 mCi Na 188 ReO 4 were reacted in water bath at 80 \u00b0C for 25 min. After the end of the reaction, 10 \u03bcl portions of the mixture were taken and applied at 1.5 cm from the lower end of the strips for determining the labeling yield by paper chromatograph with Whatman No. 1 (1 cm \u00d7 13 cm). The strips were developed by saline solution until the solvent reached the top portions. The strips were dried and cut into 1 cm long equal segments. The distribution of 188 Re on paper chromatograph was measured with a gamma-ray counter. The radioactivity for 188 Re\u2013GO are all at the origin on the chromatography paper developed by saline solution (retardation faction, R f = 0), with R f value for free ReO 4 - ions being at about 0.9\u20131. And the labeling yield of 188 Re\u2013GO was calculated by the following equation: Labeling yield = Y [ segment 0 ] / Y [ segments ( 0 \u2013 10 ) ] \u00d7 100 % Y [segment 0] represents the counts number of per minute (CPM) of segment 0, while Y [segments (0\u201310)] represents the CPM of summed over all segments. 2.3 Purification of 188 Re\u2013GO and examination of its stability Before the distribution evaluation, the radiolabeling compound was washed three times with saline to remove unreacted ascorbic acid and stannous chloride. Then the 188 Re\u2013GO was dispersed in Millipore water, serum-free culture medium (RPMI-1640 only), and complete culture medium (RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) at room temperature, respectively. Portions (10 \u03bcl) from each suspension were applied for determining the radiochemical purity by the manner described above. The radiochemical purity of labeled 188 Re\u2013GO obtained at various time intervals was used to examine its stability in vitro . To assess the stability of 188 Re\u2013GO in vivo , 20 Kun Ming mice (male 20 \u00b1 2 g, 6\u20138 W) were intravenously injected with 200 \u03bcl of the 188 Re\u2013GO suspension containing 50 \u03bcCi of radioactivity. The mice were then anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h post injection, the anticoagulant blood was collected and its radioactivity was measured with gamma-ray counter. Then the blood was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded and the remaining solid was washed with deionized water. Its radioactivity was measured with gamma-ray counter for comparison with the whole blood radioactivity. 2.4 Distribution of GO in mice The distribution characteristics of GO was performed with 48 Kun Ming mice (male 20 \u00b1 2 g, 6\u20138 W), which were randomly divided into six groups. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and 20 \u03bcCi 188 Re\u2013GO was intravenously administrated to each mouse. At different time points, the mice were sacrificed by dislocation of vertebrae, and important organs and tissues were excised, washed, and weighed, radioactive of each tissue was measured with gamma-ray counter. The uptake of the radiolabeled GO in different organs and tissues was expressed as the percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g), as shown in Eq. (1) . The resultant data were expressed as mean values with the standard deviation. (1) Organ uptake = Organ radioactivity Total radioactivity \u00d7 organ weight ( g ) \u00d7 100 % 2.5 Histopathological morphology studies Based on the distribution results, the organs with high %ID/g values were excised for histopathological analysis. A similar animal experiment procedure as described above was adopted, after a single intravenous injection of 1 and 10 mg kg \u22121 body weight of GO, mice were sacrificed at 14 days post injection. Lungs, liver, spleen, and kidney were collected and fixed with paraformaldehyde for histopathological analysis. All histopathological tests were performed using standard laboratory procedures. The tissues were embedded in paraffin blocks, then sliced into 5 \u03bcm thick sections and placed onto glass slides. After hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining, the slides were observed and photographs were taken using an optical microscope (Motorized inverted system microscope IX81/IX81\u2013ZDC, Japan). The pathologist performing the visual analysis was blinded to the sample identifier and results of the other histopathological analyses. 2.6 Observation of the erythrocyte shape and erythrocyte hemolysis assay Fresh blood was obtained from Sprague\u2013Dawley rats and anticoagulated with 3.8% sodium citrate (blood to sodium citrate is 9:1 in volume), then the anticoagulated blood was centrifuged (4000 rpm, 5 min) at 4 \u00b0C using a centrifuge himac-CF 16RX (Hitachi, Japan). The plasma and buffy coat were removed by aspiration. The separated erythrocytes were washed three times by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 5 min) in 10 volumes of 10 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS), which consisted of 125 mM NaCl and 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 and Na 2 HPO 4 in deionized water, adjusted to pH 7.4. The supernatant and buffy coat of white cells was carefully removed with each wash. During the last washing, the erythrocytes were obtained by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 5 min). Washed erythrocytes were finally re-suspended to the desired hematocrit level using the same buffer and stored at 4 \u00b0C and used within 6 h of sample preparation. The effect of GO on the erythrocyte shape changes was investigated by optical microscopy. Erythrocyte suspension (10% hematocrit) was incubated with various doses of GO suspension. At different time points, 100 \u03bcl of these reaction mixtures were dropped onto glass slide and observed by optical microscopy directly. The observation of the erythrocyte shape changes was carried out at 37 \u00b0C using an optical microscope (Motorized inverted system microscope IX81/IX81\u2013ZDC, Japan); the overall magnification was 400\u00d7. The in vitro effect of human erythrocyte hemolysis by GO was evaluated according to the procedures described by Ng et al. [35] . An erythrocyte suspension (10% hematocrit) was incubated with GO at different concentrations (in PBS, pH 7.4) up to 6 h. The reaction mixtures were shaken gently while being incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 6 h. At intervals of every 60 min, a volume of 200 \u03bcL of the reaction mixtures was removed and diluted with 3.8 mL of PBS and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance of the resulting supernatant (A) was measured at 541 nm by a spectrophotometer U-3010 (Hitachi, Japan). Likewise, the same volume of the reaction mixtures was treated with 3.8 mL of distilled water to obtain a complete hemolysis. The absorbance of its supernatant ( B ) was measured at the same condition. The percentage hemolysis was calculated from the ratio of the readings ( A / B ) \u00d7 100, which reflected the influence of GO on erythrocyte hemolysis. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation and characterization of GO GO was prepared by using a modified Hummers method [34] . Analysis of products by AFM revealed mostly single layered GO (>70%) with \u223c1.0 nm in topographic height and 10\u2013800 nm in lateral width ( Fig. 1 ). No significant amounts of particles were observed on the mica substrate, showing good purity of the GO in solution. The GO solution was stable in pure water for over a month and did not agglomerate. Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectroscopy of GO by using 632 nm wavelength excitation. The results clearly showed that D-band signal was significantly appeared after graphite treated with concentration sulfuric acid and KMnO 4 , suggesting that the disorder was introduced onto the graphene layer. The Raman characteristic of GO is consistent with many previous reports [36,37] . 3.2 Labeling, purification and stability studies of 188 Re\u2013GO compounds The labeling procedure is based on the reduction of Re(VII) to Re(V), which possesses unfilled electron orbits and has strong coordination ability to other molecules. When Re(VII) was reduced into Re(V), the unfilled electron orbits of Re(V) were filled by electrons donated by carboxyl group and hydroxyl group from GO and thus formed a stable labeling complex. The labeling yield of 188 Re\u2013GO is over 92% under the labeling conditions described above. Also, in an independent experiment, the water stability of GO and the labeling compounds were characterized by a Nano Zeta Potential and Submicron Particle Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter Delsa). Results showed that the values of zeta potential of GO and Re\u2013GO in water are \u221229.87 and \u221220.47, respectively, suggesting that the reduction reaction has only a small impact on the physicochemical properties of GO. Prior to the experiments of distribution of 188 Re\u2013GO, the labeled compounds were needed to carry out further purification to remove the unreacted stannous chloride, ascorbic acid, and free NaReO 4 . By simple triple purification cycles of centrifugation and washing with saline, as indicated by analysis of the paper chromatography, the typical radiochemical purity of the 188 Re\u2013GO increased from 92.2% to 98.5% (data not shown). In vitro stability of 188 Re\u2013GO was examined by checking their radiochemical purities at various elapsed times with the paper chromatography technique. Results showed that 188 Re\u2013GO is very stable in three kinds of media tested in this work (pure water, RPMI-1640 (FBS free), and complete cell culture medium (RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS), with the radiochemical purity of the labeling compounds kept greater than 90% even after 48 h (data not shown). In addition, 188 Re\u2013GO showed excellent stability in mice. About 67% 188 Re\u2013GO kept intact in blood even at 24 h post injection, suggesting that the distribution resulted from the counting of the 188 Re\u2013GO radioactivity in this work was the real distribution of GO in mice, rather than that of radionuclide 188 Re, which may fall from the 188 Re\u2013GO. 3.3 Distribution of 188 Re\u2013GO in mice The distribution data of 188 Re\u2013GO in mice were obtained from the radioactive measurement. As shown in Table 1 , the GO ( 188 Re\u2013GO) was apparently cleared from the blood stream rapidly and distributed throughout most of the organs within 48 h, but the accumulation was primarily in the lungs, liver, and spleen, with to much less extent in the brain, heart, and bone. As time elapsed, gradual decrease was observed in most organs, except for liver, and spleen. However, it is worth noting that the GO was retained in lungs, liver, and spleen at the relatively high accumulation levels for a long time. At 48 h post injection, there was considerable amounts of GO in lungs (25.53 \u00b1 6.27%ID/g), liver (2.88 \u00b1 0.49%ID/g), and spleen (2.41 \u00b1 0.93%ID/g). The high-level accumulation of GO in organs such as lungs, liver, and spleen suggested that the rapid uptake of the GO was intercepted by the mononuclear phagocytes in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Such an uptake mechanism involving RES is consistent with the general conception on the fate of nanoparticles in vivo . The high-level accumulation of GO in lungs also allowed direct observation of digested tissue solutions. In an independent experiment, mice were exposed to 400 \u03bcg of GO and sacrificed at 30 min, 1 and 3 days post injection, respectively. Tissues (about 0.5 g liver, and the whole lung and spleen) were collected and then digested with 2 mL of a mixture of 65% HClO 4 and 30% H 2 O 2 (1:1 in volume) at 90 \u00b0C for 1 h. After centrifugation (10,000 rpm \u00d7 10 min), the digested solution was blackcolored, much more dark color was found in lung digestion solution than liver and spleen (not shown), indicated that much high accumulation of GO in lungs than that of in liver or spleen. In addition, to examine the clearance of GO from mice, the radioactivity intensity in urine was measured at different time points up to 48 h. Fig. 3 A shows a plot of values of %ID/g in urine vs. time points post injection. As illustrated by the clearance curve, we observed the relative high values of %ID/g in urine within 12 h; however, the radioactivity in the urine was much lower and almost no detectable at 24 and 48 h post injection ( Fig. 3 A). The distinctive clearance behavior of GO was likely ascribed to the inhomogeneous nature of GO. Fig. 1 clearly showed that the lateral width of GO is various from several nanometers to several hundred nanometers, the various distribution of lateral width of GO may lead to some GO particles with small size were quickly eliminated through renal route, which exhibited relative high radioactivity in urine within 12 h post injection. However, most of GO particles with large size were intercepted by lungs, thus leading to high accumulation level of GO in lungs. The high uptake of GO in lungs was hard to excrete ( Table 1 ), which is consistent with the radioactivity intensity in urine at 24 and 48 h post injection ( Fig. 3 A). The distribution and clearance characteristics of GO, including slow excretion through renal excretion route and long time accumulation in organs are significant different from the pervious reports by Singh et al. [28,38] . They demonstrated that f-SWCNT/f-MCWNT labeled with 111 In was not retained in any of the organs such as liver or spleen and rapidly cleared from systemic circulation through the renal excretion route. But the high-level accumulation of GO in target organs is similar to many other reports. For example, Sun et al. using isotope ratio mass spectroscopy to determine the 13 C-enriched SWCNT and found that SWCNT were distributed in the entire body, with major accumulation in liver, lungs, and spleen over 3 months [39\u201341] . Furthermore, we also investigated the blood circulation half time of GO in mice. Fig. 3 B showed that, as time elapsed, the radioactivity in blood was gradually decreased within 24 h. And as illustrated by the solid curve, the data are well modeled by first-order (exponential) decay with a half-life of 5.3 \u00b1 1.2 h, which is much longer than the SWCNT (1.0 \u00b1 0.1 h) and fullerene (C 60 ) [25,40] . The relative long blood circulation half time suggested that GO may be a promising candidate for biomedical applications, especially for targeted drug delivery. In conclusion, compared with other CNM, such as SWCNT, MWCNT, C 60 , and ND, GO showed extremely high accumulation in lungs, with relative long blood circulation time and low uptake by RES. As illustrated by Table 1 , the %ID/g values for lungs, liver, and spleen were 32.76 \u00b1 12.24%, 3.04 \u00b1 0.37%, and 4.11 \u00b1 1.63% at 24 h post injection, respectively. Considered the ratio between the %ID/g values of lungs and other organs, the ratio values of lungs/liver, lungs/spleen, and lungs/kidney are greater than 10, 8, and 150, respectively, which are much higher than the other CNM ( Table 2 ). In addition, it is worth pointing out that GO showed relative longer blood circulation half time (\u22485.3 h) than the other CNM [25,40] . The difference distribution and clearance characteristics in the CNM is likely due to the surface chemistry of GO from the other CNM. And the relative long blood circulation half time and low uptake by the RES are largely attributing to its distinctive physicochemical properties, such as small size, high water dispersion, and unique structure characteristics. 3.4 Histopathological morphology analysis of GO in mice Based on the distribution of GO in mice, we checked the pathological changes in the targeted organs, such as lungs, liver, spleen, and kidney with 1 or 10 mg kg \u22121 body weight of GO at 14 days post injection. The representative micrographs from each group at day 14 after GO injection are depicted in Figs. 4 and 5 . No pathological changes were observed in the examined organs, such as lungs, liver, spleen, and kidney when mouse treated with 1 mg kg \u22121 body weight of GO for 14 days, and no significant pathological changes were observed in liver, spleen, and kidney even at the dosage of 10 mg kg \u22121 body weight (in Figs. 4 and 5 ). However, due to the high-level accumulation and slow clearance, we did observed significant pathological changes, including granulomatous lesions, pulmonary edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and fibrosis throughout the lung for the group treated with 10 mg kg \u22121 body weight of GO ( Fig. 4 E). These results suggested that GO is biocompatible in most tissues but caution about lung pathologies at higher doses. Although previous studies demonstrated that GO were biocompatibility with various cell lines, thus far no studies have reported its toxicity in vivo . As the first report focused on the in vivo toxicity of GO, it is an important step for the practical biomedical applications of GO in the near future. 3.5 Observation of the erythrocyte shape and erythrocyte hemolysis Optical microscopy analysis of erythrocyte morphology after incubated with PBS, 10 and 80 \u03bcg mL \u22121 GO suspension was shown in Fig. 6 . We found that almost all the erythrocyte membranes were kept integrated when they incubated with PBS for up to 4 h ( Fig. 6 A and B). Although GO flakes were adhered to the surface of RBC, GO suspension showed little effect on the erythrocyte morphology and membrane integrity at the dosage of 10 \u03bcg mL \u22121 for 1 and 4 h ( Fig. 6 C and D). However, a part of erythrocyte membranes were ruptured and ghost cells were observed when erythrocytes exposed to 80 \u03bcg mL \u22121 of GO for 4 h ( Fig. 6 F). The good biocompatibility of GO to RBC was further evidenced by hemolysis assay. As shown in Fig. 7 A, we found that the hemoglobin has two absorbance peaks at 541 and 576 nm, and there is a well linear relationship between hemoglobin concentration and the absorbance value of 541 nm (not shown). In the present experiment, the effect of GO on the hemolysis was determined based on the absorbance of 541 nm. It can be seen that GO could induce dose and time dependent hemolysis. It can be seen that no significant difference was found between RBC exposure to PBS and GO suspension at the dosage of 10\u201380 \u03bcg mL \u22121 at 1 h. However, there is about 6.4% hemolysis was induced by incubated with PBS for 6 h and 18.5% hemolysis was induced by 80 \u03bcg mL \u22121 GO suspension ( Fig. 7 B). Compared to the previous report by McFetridge [45] , GO showed better biocompatibility with RBC than SWCNT, they found that about 11% RBC were hemolysis by unrefined SWCNT within 15 min. The biocompatibility of GO with blood cells is consistent with previous studies, which suggested that GO are biocompatibility with various cells and bacteria [20\u201323] . In this work, we first evidenced that GO is biocompatibility with blood cells, which will pave the way for further development of GO for targeted drug delivery and other biomedical applications. 4 Conclusions We presented the distribution and biocompatibility profiles of GO in Kun Ming mice. High uptake and long term retention of GO in lungs were demonstrated by using radiotracer technique. And compared with other CNM, GO exhibited relative long blood circulation time (half-time 5.3 \u00b1 1.2 h), and low uptake by RES. The difference distribution characteristics in CNM is likely due to the surface chemistry of GO from other CNM. No significant pathological changes were observed in all the examined organs when mice were exposed to 1 mg kg \u22121 of GO for 14 days. And compared with SWCNT, GO exhibited less adverse effects on RBC. These results suggested the potential biomedical applications of GO, especially for targeted drug delivery to the lung. However, it is worth noting that the high uptake of GO in lungs was hard to excrete, thus may lead to adverse effect on these organs. In this work, we observed significant pathological changes including inflammation cell infiltration, pulmonary edema, and granuloma formation in the lung of mice when mice were exposed to 10 mg kg \u22121 body weight of GO for 14 days. This reminded us much more attention should be paid to the toxicity of highly dosed GO, including acute and chronic toxicity to the lung and other target organs. In the present work, however, we only provided the preliminary information on toxicity of GO in mice; further experimental verification and mechanistic elucidation are required before GO widely used for biomedical applications.

We found that the CdTe QDs were more cytotoxic than CdCl(2) solutions even when the intracellular Cd(2+) concentrations were identical in HEK293 cells treated with them, implying the cytotoxicity of CdTe QDs cannot attributed solely to the toxic effect of free Cd(2+). Moreover, we discovered that the cytotoxicity of QDs was based on the concentration of total QDs ingested by cells. Our data clearly showed that specific properties of nanoparticles have an obvious influence on their cytotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "To explore the novel properties of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) in nanotoxicity assays, the adsorption of phenol red (a pH indicator for culture medium) by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and three kinds of carbon blacks (CBs) with nanosize, and its effects on cytotoxicity were studied. Results indicated that the phenol red adsorbed and delivered into cells by CBs was responsible for the toxicity to Hela cells in the medium without serum. The cellular uptake of phenol red was verified using 125I-labeling techniques. The size-dependent cytotoxicity of CBs was found to closely correlate to adsorption of phenol red, cellular uptake of phenol red-CB complexes and the amount of phenol red delivered into the cells by CBs. Although the CBs were either nontoxic or slightly toxic, as vehicles of phenol red, they played an essential role in the cytotoxicity induced by phenol red. However, MWNTs showed an intrinsic cytotoxicity independent of phenol red. The implications associated with these findings are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Semiconductor Quantum dots (QDs) have raised great attention because of their superior optical properties and wide utilization in biological and biomedical studies. More recently, there have been intense concerns on cytotoxicity assessment of QDs. Most QDs are made of heavy metal ions (e.g., Cd(2+)), which may result in potential in vitro toxicity that hampers their practical applications. In this article, we aim to summarize recent progress on mechanistic studies of cytotoxicity of II-IV QDs. We have studied the cytotoxicity of a series of aqueous synthesized QDs (aqQDs), i.e. CdTe, CdTe/CdS core-shell structured and CdTe/CdS/ZnS core-shell-shell structured aqQDs. Our results suggested that released cadmium ions are responsible for the observed cytotoxicity of cadmium-based QDs. The fact that CdTe/CdS/ZnS core-shell-shell structured QDs are nearly nontoxic to cells further confirmed the role of released cadmium ions on cytotoxicity, and the effective protection of the ZnS shell. However, intracellular level of Cd(2+) ions cannot be the only reason since the comparison with CdCl(2)-treated cells suggests there are other factors contributed to the cytotoxicity of aqQDs. Our studies on genome-wide gene expression profiling and subcellular localization of aqQDs with synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) further suggest that the cytotoxicity of CdTe QDs not only comes from the release of Cd(2+) ions but also intracellular distribution of QD nanoparticles in cells and the associated nanoscale effects.",

        "abstract": "Nanomaterial-based molecular beacons (nanoMBs) have been extensively explored due to unique merits of nanostructures, including gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-, carbon nanotube (CNT)-, and graphene-based nanoMBs. Those nanoMBs are well-studied; however, they possess relatively poor salt stability or low specificity, limiting their wide applications. Here, we present a novel kind of multicolor silicon-based nanoMBs by using AuNP-decorated silicon nanowires as high-performance quenchers. Significantly, the nanoMBs feature robust stability in high-concentration (0.1 M) salt solution and wide-ranging temperature (10-80 \u00b0C), high quenching efficiency (>90%) for various fluorophores (e.g., FAM, Cy5, and ROX), and large surfaces for simultaneous assembly of different DNA strands. We further show that silicon-based nanoMBs are highly effective for sensitive and specific multidetection of DNA targets. The unprecedented advantages of silicon-based multicolor nanoMBs would bring new opportunities for challenging bioapplications, such as allele discrimination, early cancer diagnosis, and molecular engineering, etc.",

However, the analysis of different cell types remains challenging due to the subtle differences in cell surface features. Here, we have demonstrated nanoplasmonic differentiation of cell types by using DNA-gold nanoparticle nanoconjugates (DNA-AuNPs). Our strategy relies on cross reactive receptors (a collection of DNA-AuNPs) that are employed to bind the different cells that produce fingerprint-like patterns for each type of cell. Because of the enhanced nanoplasmonic effect of AuNPs via seeded-growth, we could effectively differentiate various cell lines, e.g., 786-O, L929, Hela, and RAW264.7, with dark-field microscopy or even naked eyes.",

Acupuncture is practiced worldwide, despite difficulties in reconciling its principles with evidence-based medicine. Here we studied the effect of acupuncture treatment on motor function and its underlying mechanism in mouse model of Parkinson's Disease (PD) using 1 -methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-terahydropyridine(MPTP). We found that acupuncture treatment at acupoint GB34 improved motor function of model mice. We also found evidence that lysosomal membranes were repaired and \u03b1-synuclein was degraded, suggesting that the autophagy level of PD model mice was increased.

Our ability to rationally engineer this potentially useful property into normally non-allosteric catalysts, however, remains limited. In response we report a DNA nanotechnology-enabled approach for introducing allostery into catalytic nucleic acids. Specifically, we have grafted one or two copies of a peroxidase-like DNAzyme, hemin-bound G-quadruplex (hemin-G), onto a DNA tetrahedral nanostructure in such a manner as to cause them to interact, modulating their catalytic activity. We achieve allosteric regulation of these catalysts by incorporating dynamically responsive oligonucleotides that respond to specific \"effector\" molecules (complementary oligonucleotides or small molecules), altering the spacing between the catalytic sites and thus regulating their activity. This designable approach thus enables subtle allosteric modulation in DNAzymes that is potentially of use for nanomedicine and nanomachines.",

However, limited information is known about their biokinetic behavior and toxicity in vivo. In this article, we investigated the biodistribution of NDs using radiotracer techniques and evaluated its acute toxicity in Kun Ming mice after intratracheal instillation. The biodistribution showed that, besides having the highest retention in the lung, NDs were distributed mainly in the spleen, liver, bone and heart. An analysis of histological morphology and biochemical parameters indicated that NDs could induce dose-dependent toxicity to the lung, liver, kidney and blood. This work provided fundamental data for understanding the biodistribution of NDs and will provide guidance for further study of their toxicity.",

The studies indicated that serum proteins in cell culture medium had significant effect. When cells were exposed to NDs dispersed in complete cell culture medium, no cytotoxicity was detected. However, severe cell death was found after exposed to NDs dispersed in serum-free medium. Possible reasons for serum-dependent cytotoxicity were discussed and the potential influence of serum on the test of efficacy was pointed for anticancer drug delivery system based on NDs. Then adsorption of anticancer drug 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) by NDs was studied. Experiments indicated that diluted NaOH solution could promote the loading of HCPT on NDs. And a slow release of HCPT from the HCPT-ND complex was established in low pH media. Assessments of cell viability and imaging with transmission electron microscopy demonstrated a much higher efficacy of the HCPT-ND complex compared with HCPT alone. On the basis of adsorption feature of ND aggregates, new strategy for the design of targeting drug delivery systems of NDs was proposed.",

In this work, we present a systematic study on the in vivo distribution and pulmonary toxicity of NGO for up to 3 months after exposure. Radioisotope tracing and morphological observation demonstrated that intratracheally instilled NGO was mainly retained in the lung. NGO could result in acute lung injury (ALI) and chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Such NGO-induced ALI was related to oxidative stress and could effectively be relieved with dexamethasone treatment. In addition, we found that the biodistribution of 125I-NGO varied greatly from that of 125I ions, hence it is possible that nanoparticulates could deliver radioactive isotopes deep into the lung, which might settle in numerous 'hot spots' that could result in mutations and cancers, raising environmental concerns about the large-scale production of graphene oxide. \u00a9 2013 Nature Japan K.K.",

By exploiting this enzyme-triggered photophysical property, we employed these FIST probes to monitor the GGT activity in living cells, which showed remarkable differentiation between ovarian cancer cells and normal cells.

        "abstract": "We present a highly sensitive colorimetric method for microRNA (miRNA) detection. This method is based on a rolling-circle amplification (RCA) DNA machine, which integrates RCA, nicking enzyme signal amplification and DNAzyme signal amplification. The DNA machine is triggered by the hybridization of target miRNA with a rational designed padlock DNA template and activated by RCA. The resulting RCA product then autonomously replicates a multiple machinery cutter cycle and generates accumulated amount of products. Specifically, the DNA product in the present work is designed as a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mimicking DNAzyme, which could that catalyze a colorimetric reaction and generate colored product. Through these cascade amplifications, microRNA (miRNA) as low as 2 aM could be detected. As an example of in vivo application, miRNA from single Drosophila larva was successfully analyzed. Drosophila is a model organism that provides a powerful genetic tool to study gene functions. Study of Drosophila miRNAs has brought us knowledge of its biogenesis and biological functions. The analysis of miRNA typically requires a pretreatment process of extracting total RNAs from target cells, followed by quantitative analysis of target miRNA in total RNA samples, which nevertheless suffers from laborious total RNA extraction and time-consuming processes and poor limit of detection. Meanwhile, the tiny size of Drosophila makes it difficult to accurately measure trivial changes of its cellular miRNA levels. The ability to detect ultralow concentration of miRNA of the proposed method enables the analysis the expression of mir-1 in single Drosophila larva. We thus expect that the strategy may open new avenues for in situ miRNA analysis in single cell or living animals.",

        "title": "Functional DNA nanostructures for theranostic applications.",
        "abstract": "There has been tremendous interest in constructing nanostructures by exploiting the unparalleled ability of DNA molecules in self-assembly. We have seen the appearance of many fantastic, \"art-like\" DNA nanostructures in one, two, or three dimensions during the last two decades. More recently, much attention has been directed to the use of these elegant nanoobjects for applications in a wide range of areas. Among them, diagnosis and therapy (i.e., theranostics) are of particular interest given the biological nature of DNA. One of the major barricades for the biosensor design lies in the restricted target accessibility at the solid-water interface. DNA nanotechnology provides a convenient approach to well control the biomolecule-confined surface to increase the ability of molecular recognition at the biosensing interface. For example, tetrahedral DNA nanostructures with thiol modifications can be self-assembled at the gold surface with high reproducibility. Since DNA tetrahedra are highly rigid and well-defined structures with atomic precision and versatile functionality, they provide scaffolds for anchoring of a variety of biomolecular probes (DNA, aptamers, peptides, and proteins) for biosensing. Significantly, this DNA nanostructure-based biosensing platform greatly increases target accessibility and improves the sensitivity for various types of molecular targets (DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules) by several orders of magnitude. In an alternative approach, DNA nanostructures provide a framework for the development of dynamic nanosensors that can function inside the cell. DNA tetrahedra are found to be facilely cell permeable and can sense and image specific molecules in cells. More importantly, these DNA nanostructures can be efficient drug delivery nanocarriers. Since they are DNA molecules by themselves, they have shown excellent cellular biocompatibility with minimal cytotoxicity. As an example, DNA tetrahedra tailored with CpG oligonucleotide drugs have shown greatly improved immunostimulatory effects that makes them a highly promising nanomedicine. By taking them together, we believe these functionalized DNA nanostructures can be a type of intelligent theranostic nanodevice for simultaneous sensing, diagnosis, and therapy inside the cell.",

Notably, nanoTiO2 particles were mainly retained in lungs after intratracheal instillation, slowly cleared and were still present at 3 months. Different methods of intratracheal instillation influenced the clearance of nanoTiO2 from lungs. NanoTiO2 interfered with the natural distribution of K, Ca, Fe, Cu and Zn in lungs. We have thus demonstrated that SRXRF provides an effective approach to investigate the distribution of metal nanomaterials and native metal elements in tissues and organs, which offers new opportunities for revealing nanotoxic mechanisms of nanomaterials.",

In this report, we compared the effect of oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (OXWNT) and irradiated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (IRWNT) on the enzymatic activity of PchPipA. Both OXWNT and IRWNT decreased the biocatalytic activity of PchPipA to some extent when they were added in the reaction system, while OXWNT exhibited higher inhibition of the activity of PchPipA than IRWNT. These results suggested that the water solubility may be another property that can affect the interaction of bio-macromolecular products and nanoparticles.",

However, it remains challenging to precisely control the orientation and conformation of surface-tethered oligonucleotides and finely tune the hybridization ability. We herein report a novel strategy for spatially controlled functionalization of AuNPs with designed diblock oligonucleotides that are free of modifications. We have demonstrated that poly adenine (polyA) can serve as an effective anchoring block for preferential binding with the AuNP surface, and the appended recognition block adopts an upright conformation that favors DNA hybridization. The lateral spacing and surface density of DNA on AuNPs can also be systematically modulated by adjusting the length of the polyA block. Significantly, this diblock oligonucleotide strategy results in DNA-AuNPs nanoconjugates with high and tunable hybridization ability, which form the basis of a rapid plasmonic DNA sensor.",

In contrast to in vitro-selected aptamers, which possess specific \"lock-and-key\" recognition, ENSaptamers rely on pattern recognition that mimics natural olfactory or gustatory systems. Nanographene oxide was employed to provide a low-background and highly reproducible fluorescent assay system.

        "abstract": "Nanomaterials hold great promise for applications in the delivery of various molecules with poor cell penetration, yet its potential for delivery of metal ions is rarely considered. Particularly, there is limited insight about the cytotoxicity triggered by nanoparticle-ion interactions. Oxidative stress is one of the major toxicological mechanisms for nanomaterials, and we propose that it may also contribute to nanoparticle-ion complexes induced cytotoxicity.To explore the potential of nanodiamonds (NDs) as vehicles for metal ion delivery, we used a broad range of experimental techniques that aimed at getting a comprehensive assessment of cell responses after exposure of NDs, metal ions, or ND-ion mixture: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, Trypan blue exclusion text, optical microscope observation, synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and micro X-ray fluorescence (\u03bcXRF) microscopy, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation. In addition, theoretical calculation and molecular dynamics (MD) computation were used to illustrate the adsorption properties of different metal ion on NDs as well as release profile of ion from ND-ion complexes at different pH values.The adsorption capacity of NDs for different metal ions was different, and the adsorption for Cu2+ was the most strong among divalent metal ions. These different ND-ion complexes then had different cytotoxicity by influencing the subsequent cellular responses. Detailed investigation of ND-Cu2+ interaction showed that the amount of released Cu2+ from ND-Cu2+ complexes at acidic lysosomal conditions was much higher than that at neutral conditions, leading to the elevation of intracellular ROS level, which triggered cytotoxicity. By theoretical approaches, we demonstrated that the functional carbon surface and cluster structures of NDs made them good vehicles for metal ions delivery.NDs played the Trojan horse role by allowing large amounts of metal ions accumulate into living cells followed by subsequent release of ions in the interior of cells, which then led to cytotoxicity. The present experimental and theoretical results provide useful insight into understanding of cytotoxicity triggered by nanoparticle-ion interactions, and open new ways in the interpretation of nanotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "We herein present a new kind of silicon-based electrochemical sensor using a gold nanoparticles-decorated silicon wafer (AuNPs@Si) as a high-performance electrode, which is facilely prepared via in situ AuNPs growth on a silicon wafer. Particularly significantly, the resultant electrochemical sensor is efficacious for label-free DNA detection with high sensitivity due to the unique merits of the prepared silicon-based electrode. Typically, DNA at remarkably low concentrations (1-10 fM) could be readily detected without requiring additional signal-amplification procedures, which is better than or comparable to the lowest DNA concentration ever detected via well-studied signal-amplification-assisted electrochemical sensors. Moreover, the silicon-based sensor features high specificity, allowing unambiguous discrimination of single-based mismatches. We further show that real-time DNA assembly is readily monitored via recording the intensity changes of current signals due to the robust thermal stability of the silicon-based electrode. The unprecedented advantages of the silicon-based electrochemical sensor would offer new opportunities for myriad sensing applications.",

        "abstract": "CONSPECTUS: Highly specific DNA base-pairing is the basis for both fulfilling its genetic role and constructing novel nanostructures and hybrid conjugates with inorganic nanomaterials (NMs). There exist many remarkable differences in the physical properties of single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA, which play important roles in regulation of biological processes in nature. Rapid advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology pose new questions on how DNA and DNA structures interact with inorganic nanomaterials or cells and animals, which should be important for their biological and biomedical applications. In this Account, we intend to provide an overview on many facets of DNA and DNA structures in artificial and living systems, with the focus on their properties and functions at the interfaces of inorganic nanomaterials and biological systems. ssDNA, dsDNA, and DNA nanostructures interact with NMs in different ways. In particular, gold nanoparticles and graphene oxide exhibit strikingly different affinity toward ssDNA and dsDNA. Such binding differences can be coupled with optical properties of NMs. For example, DNA hybridization can effectively modulate the plasmonic and catalytic properties of gold nanoparticles. By exploitation of these interactions, there have been many ways for sensitive transduction of biomolecular recognition for various sensing applications. Alternatively, modulation of the properties of DNA and DNA structures with NMs has led to new tools for genetic analysis including genotyping and haplotyping. Self-assembled DNA nanostructures have emerged as a new type of NMs with pure biomolecules. These nanostructures can be designed in one, two, or three dimensions with various sizes, shapes, and geometries. They also have characteristics of uniform size, precise addressability, excellent water solubility, and biocompatibility. These nanostructures provide a new toolbox for biophysical studies with unparalleled advantages, for example, NMR-based protein structure determination and single-molecule studies. Also importantly, DNA nanostructures have proven highly useful in various applications including biological detection, bioreactors, and nanomedicine. In particular, DNA nanostructures exhibit high cellular permeability, a property that is not available for ssDNA and dsDNA, which is required for their drug delivery applications. DNA and DNA structures can also form hybrids with inorganic NMs. Notably, DNA anchored at the interface of inorganic NMs behaves differently from that at the macroscopic interface. Several types of DNA-NM conjugates have exerted beneficial effects for bioassays and in vitro translation of proteins. Even more interestingly, hybrid nanoconjugates demonstrate distinct properties under the context of biological systems such as cultured cells or animal models. These unprecedented properties not only arouse great interest in studying such interfaces but also open new opportunities for numerous applications in artificial and living systems.",

        "abstract": "DNA nanostructures have attracted great attention due to their precisely controllable geometry and great potential in various areas including bottom-up self-assembly. However, construction of higher-order DNA nanoarchitectures with individual DNA nanostructures is often hampered with the purity and quantity of these \"bricks\". Here, we introduced size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to prepare highly purified tetrahedral DNA nanocages in large scale and demonstrated that precise quantification of DNA nanocages was the key to the formation of higher-order DNA nanoarchitectures. We successfully purified a series of DNA nanocages with different sizes, including seven DNA tetrahedra with different edge lengths (7, 10, 13, 17, 20, 26, 30 bp) and one trigonal bipyramid with a 20-bp edge. These highly purified and aggregation-free DNA nanocages could be self-assembled into higher-order DNA nanoarchitectures with extraordinarily high yields (98% for dimer and 95% for trimer). As a comparison, unpurified DNA nanocages resulted in low yield of 14% for dimer and 12% for trimer, respectively. AFM images cleraly presented the characteristic structure of monomer, dimer and trimer, impling the purified DNA nanocages well-formed the designed nanoarchitectures. Therefore, we have demonstrated that highly purified DNA nanocages are excellent \"bricks\" for DNA nanotechnology and show great potential in various applications of DNA nanomaterials.",

        "abstract": "With their increased production, application, and emissions to environment, adverse effects of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on environment and human health have attracted wide attention. However, much of the research effort has been focused on biological effects of CNTs alone. Due to their high adsorption ability, CNTs are easy to adsorb various toxic metal ions in environment and form CNT-metal ions complex. Biological effects of the complex differ from the individual effect of CNTs or ions, being far from a simple pile-up effect of CNTs and ions. In this paper, we give a review on metal ions adsorption on CNTs, the affecting factors, and environmental toxicology of CNT-metal ions complex. We also point out that radionuclide tracer techniques and synchrotron radiation techniques can play important roles in studies on interactions of metal ions with CNTs and the biological effects on environmental toxicology.",

        "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been synthesized and produced on large scale for their wide application. They have high absorption ability to organic contaminants (such as benzene) and can form CNTs-benzene combination with benzene. In this article, the acute pulmonary toxicity, induced by multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), benzene, and their combination, was studied by administrating the three test materials into mice lungs via intratracheal instillation. The biochemical parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and pathological lesions in lungs were used as endpoints to evaluate the pulmonary toxicity of the three test materials at 3-day and 7-day postexposure, respectively. After the mice were intratracheally instilled with MWCNTs, benzene and MWCNTs-benzene combination at doses of 6.67 mg/kg, 2.67 mg/kg, and 9.34 mg/kg (containing 6.67 mg/kg MWCNTs and 2.67 mg/kg benzene), the total protein, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), acid phosphatase (ACP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in BALF and pathological lesions in lungs were examined. At 3-day postexposure, MWCNTs induced obvious pulmonary toxicity and benzene only induced slight pulmonary toxicity, whereas their combination induced very severe pulmonary toxicity. At 7-day postexposure, MWCNTs and benzene did not induce pulmonary toxicity individually, whereas their combination still induced severe pulmonary toxicity. These data indicated that, at the instilled doses in this experiment, the MWCNTs can alone induce acute pulmonary toxicity in mice and the benzene does not induce pulmonary toxicity, but the pulmonary toxicity of MWCNTs is enhanced after they form MWCNTs-benzene combination with low dose of benzene. The enhanced pulmonary toxicity may be due to the change of MWCNTs aggregation ability after benzene is adsorbed on them.",

Whereas silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known to have stronger plasmonic properties than AuNPs, modification of AgNPs with SH-DNA is technically challenging, partially due to the instability of Ag-S bonding. Here we demonstrate a facile approach to self-assemble unmodified DNA on AgNPs by exploiting intrinsic silver-cytosine (Ag-C) coordination. The strong Ag-C coordination allows for the ready formation of DNA-AgNP conjugates, which show favorable stability under conditions of high ionic strength and high temperature. These nanoconjugates possess much higher efficient molecular recognition capability and faster hybridization kinetics than thiolated DNA-modified AgNPs. More importantly, we could programmably tune the DNA density on AgNPs with the regulation of silver-cytosine coordination numbers, which in turn modulated their hybridizability. We further demonstrated that these DNA-AgNP conjugates could serve as excellent building blocks for assembling silver and hybrid silver-gold nanostructures with superior plasmonic properties.",

        "abstract": "There have been increasing interests in studying biological effects of nanomaterials, which are nevertheless faced up with many challenges due to the nanoscale dimensions and unique chemical properties of nanomaterials. Synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy, an advanced imaging technology with high spatial resolution and excellent elemental specificity, provides a new platform for studying interactions between nanomaterials and living systems. In this article, we review the recent progress of X-ray microscopic studies on bioeffects of nanomaterials in several living systems including cells, model organisms, animals and plants. We aim to provide an overview of the state of the art, and the advantages of using synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy for characterizing in vitro and in vivo behaviors and biodistribution of nanomaterials. We also expect that the use of a combination of new synchrotron techniques should offer unprecedented opportunities for better understanding complex interactions at the nano-biological interface and accounting for unique bioeffects of nanomaterials.Synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy is a non-destructive imaging technique that enables high resolution spatial mapping of metals with elemental level detection methods. This review summarizes the current use and perspectives of this novel technique in studying the biology and tissue interactions of nanomaterials.",

        "abstract": "DNA is typically impermeable to the plasma membrane due to its polyanionic nature. Interestingly, several different DNA nanostructures can be readily taken up by cells in the absence of transfection agents, which suggests new opportunities for constructing intelligent cargo delivery systems from these biocompatible, nonviral DNA nanocarriers. However, the underlying mechanism of entry of the DNA nanostructures into the cells remains unknown. Herein, we investigated the endocytotic internalization and subsequent transport of tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) by mammalian cells through single-particle tracking. We found that the TDNs were rapidly internalized by a caveolin-dependent pathway. After endocytosis, the TDNs were transported to the lysosomes in a highly ordered, microtubule-dependent manner. Although the TDNs retained their structural integrity within cells over long time periods, their localization in the lysosomes precludes their use as effective delivery agents. To modulate the cellular fate of the TDNs, we functionalized them with nuclear localization signals that directed their escape from the lysosomes and entry into the cellular nuclei. This study improves our understanding of the entry into cells and transport pathways of DNA nanostructures, and the results can be used as a basis for designing DNA-nanostructure-based drug delivery nanocarriers for targeted therapy.",

In this paper, we reviewed recent advances on the research of the effect of nanomaterials on biomolecular reactions and the use of nano-bio-complexes in biosensors. Much evidence has clearly indicated that nanomaterials are excellent matrixes for the immobilization of enzymes and such complexes often exhibits even higher activities than native enzymes. Consequently, a large amount of highly sensitive biosensors have been developed based on such nano-bio-complexes. We also stressed the importance of nanomaterials on the reactions of nucleic acids. By exploiting the interactions between AuNPs and DNA, several groups have developed a series of novel biosensors for the detection of DNA target and other biologically important molecules. While the state-of-the-art researches are mainly focused on the study of one nanomaterial and one biomolecule, there has been evidence that integration of nano-bio-complexes might lead to much more interesting findings. For example, nanomaterials have been found to exert great impact on complicated systems such as PCR. One might expect that the realization of highly cooperated nano-bio-machines that comprise of different nanomaterials and different biomolecules would lead to highly promising diagnostic tools both in-vivo and in-vitro.",

We have also demonstrated that macroscopic freestanding GO and rGO paper can be conveniently fabricated from their suspension via simple vacuum filtration.

        "abstract": "Although the protective effect of the polyhydroxylated fullerene derivative C(60)(OH)(n) against ionizing radiation is an area of much interest, the mechanisms relating to how polyhydroxylated fullerene derivatives improve mitochondrial dysfunction remain unknown. In order to find new and effective radioprotective agents, we synthesized a new polyhydroxylated fullerene molecule with 24 hydroxyl groups of known positions on C(60) and studied its protective effects in mice subjected to irradiation. Mice were pretreated with C(60)(OH)(24) for 2 weeks (daily, 40 mg/kg i. p.), then subjected to a lethal dose of whole body gamma-irradiation (from a (60)Co source). Survival was observed for 30 days after irradiation. Immune and mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage were analyzed in mice with the same C(60)(OH)(24) pretreatment and irradiation except that the animals were euthanized at day 5 after the irradiation. It was found that 2-week C(60)(OH)(24) pretreatment effectively reduced whole body irradiation-induced mortality without apparent toxicity. C(60)(OH)(24) pretreatment also showed significant protective effects against ionizing-radiation-induced decreases in immune and mitochondrial function and antioxidant defense in the liver and spleen. These results suggest that the polyhydroxylated fullerene derivative C(60)(OH)(24) protects against ionizing-radiation-induced mortality, possibly by enhancing immune function, decreasing oxidative damage and improving mitochondrial function.",

The influence of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating on the distribution and toxicity of the NGO was also investigated. The results show that NGO is mainly retained in the liver, lung, and spleen. Retention in the lung is partially due to NGO aggregation. The PEG coating reduces the retention of NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen and promotes the clearance of NGO from these organs, but NGO and NGO-PEG are still present after 3 months. The PEG coating effectively reduces the early weight loss caused by NGO and alleviates NGO-induced acute tissue injuries, which can include damage to the liver, lung, and kidney, and chronic hepatic and lung fibrosis.",

Typically, NIR-emitting quantum dots (QDs) are highly promising as NIR bioprobes due to their unique optical properties. However, NIR-emitting QDs-related in vivo behavior remains unknown at present, severely limiting their wide-ranging bioapplications. Herein, we investigate short- and long-term in vivo biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of the NIR-emitting QDs. Particularly, we reveal that the NIR-emitting QDs are initially accumulated in liver, spleen, and lung for short-time (0.5-4 h) post-injection, and then increasingly absorbed by kidney during long-time (4-94 days) blood circulation. Obviously time-dependent biodistribution is observed: with time continues, most of NIR-emitting QDs are finally accumulated in liver and kidney; comparatively, less NIR-emitting QDs are observed in spleen, lung, and bone marrow. Furthermore, histological and biochemical analyses, and body weight measurements demonstrate that there is no overt toxicity of NIR-emitting QDs in mice even at long-time (94 days) exposure time. Our studies provide invaluable information for the design and development of NIR-emitting QDs-based nanoprobes for biological and biomedical applications.",

The organs were collected at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h after injection. Ti content in the organs was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results indicated that injected TiO2 nanoparticles were translocated into the organs via bloodstream immediately after injection, and deposited mostly in lung, liver and spleen. The TiO2 uptake (%ID/g) in the three organs reached the peak value of 141.73%, 25.55%, and 18.07% at 6 h, 1 h and 1 h after injection, respectively. The results also showed that there was significant amount of Ti in the brains of the control, and the brain Ti content increased markedly after injection. At 1, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h after injection the brain Ti content was higher than that in blood. The experiment indicated that its toxicity on brain would be the emphasis of biological impact study of nano TiO2.",

Since its invention in the 1980s, there has been dramatic performance improvement arising from long-lasting efforts to optimize amplification conditions in both academic studies and commercial applications. More recently, a range of nanometer-sized materials including metal nanoparticles, semiconductor quantum dots, carbon nanomaterials and polymer nanoparticles, have shown unique effects in tuning amplification processes of PCR. It is proposed that these artificial nanomaterials mimic protein components in the natural DNA replication machinery in vivo. These so-called nanomaterials-assisted PCR (nanoPCR) strategies shed new light on powerful PCR with unprecedented sensitivity, selectivity and extension rate. In this review, we aim to summarize recent progress in this direction and discuss possible mechanisms for such performance improvement and potential applications in genetic analysis (particularly gene typing and haplotyping) and diagnostics.",

In this study, we have developed an ultrasensitive and highly selective electrochemical aptamer-based cocaine sensor (EACS), based on a DNA nanotechnology-based sensing platform. We have found that the electrode surface decorated with an aptamer probe-pendant tetrahedral DNA nanostructure greatly facilitates cocaine-induced fusion of the split anticocaine aptamer. This novel design leads to a sensitive cocaine sensor with a remarkably low detection limit of 33 nM. It is also important that the tetrahedra-decorated surface is protein-resistant, which not only suits the enzyme-based signal amplification scheme employed in this work, but ensures high selectivity of this sensor when deployed in sera or other adulterated samples.",

        "abstract": "Graphene oxide (GO), has created an unprecedented opportunity for development and application in biology, due to its abundant functional groups and well water solubility. Recently, the potential toxicity of GO in the environment and in humans has garnered more and more attention. In this paper, we systematically studied the cytotoxicity of GO nanosheets via examining the effect of GO on the morphology, viability and differentiation of a human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line, which was an ideal model used to study neuronal disease in vitro. The results suggested that GO had no obvious cytotoxicity at low concentration (<80 \u03bcg mL(-1)) for 96 h, but the viability of cells exhibited dose- and time-dependent decreases at high concentration (\u2265 80 \u03bcg mL(-1)). Moreover, GO did not induce apoptosis. Very interestingly, GO significantly enhanced the differentiation of SH-SY5Y induced-retinoic acid (RA) by evaluating neurite length and the expression of neuronal marker MAP2. These data provide a promising application for neurodegenerative diseases.",

The uptake of CNPs by Hela cells was measured quantitatively using 99m Tc radionuclide labeling and tracing techniques, and the dependence of CNPs uptake on serum proteins was examined. The cytotoxicity of CNPs in medium with and without serum was assayed by the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] method. It was found that cellular uptake was much higher in cells exposed to CNPs in serum-free culture medium than those in culture medium with serum. Serum proteins adsorbed on CNPs attenuated the inherent cytotoxicity of CNPs, and the extent of toxicity attenuation increased with increasing amounts of serum proteins adsorbed on CNPs. The possible reasons responsible for the considerable influence of serum proteins on cytotoxicity were indicated.",

In this work, we have demonstrated a new generation (the third generation) of E-DNA sensor for the sensitive and specific detection of microRNAs. Our third generation of E-DNA sensor can sensitively detect microRNA target (microRNA-141) as low as 1 fM. The excellent specificity has been demonstrated by its differential ability to the highly similar microRNA analogues. In our design, the use of DNA tetrahedron ensures the stem-loop structure in well controlled density with improved reactivity. The regulation of the thermodynamic stability of the stem-loop structure decreases the background signal and increases the specificity as well. The enzymes attached bring the electrocatalytic signal to amplify the detection. The combination of these effects improves the sensitivity of the E-DNA sensor and makes it suitable to the microRNA detection. Finally, our third generation of E-DNA sensor is generalizable to the detection of other micro RNA targets (for example, microRNA-21).",

Here, we have demonstrated an ultrasensitive detection platform for microRNA by combining the tetrahedral DNA nanostructure probes and hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification. The detection limits for DNA and microRNA are 100 aM and 10 aM (corresponding to 600 microRNAs in a 100 \u03bcL sample), respectively. Compared to the widely used supersandwich amplification, the detection limits are improved by 3 orders of magnitude. The uncontrolled surface immobilization and consumption of target molecules that limit the amplification efficiency of supersandwich are eliminated in our platform. Taking advantage of DNA nanotechnology, we employed three-dimensional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure as the scaffold to immobilize DNA recognition probes to increase the reactivity and accessibility, while DNA nanowire tentacles are used for efficient signal amplification by capturing multiple catalytic enzymes in a highly ordered way. The synergetic effect of DNA tetrahedron and nanowire tentacles have proven to greatly improve sensitivity for both DNA and microRNA detection.",

We have demonstrated that the CdTe QDs are highly toxic for cells due to the release of cadmium ions. Epitaxial growth of a CdS layer reduces the cytotoxicity of QDs to a small extent. However, the presence of a ZnS outlayer greatly improves the biocompatibility of QDs, with no observed cytotoxicity even at very high concentration and long-time exposure in cells. Our systematic investigation clearly shows that the cytotoxicity of QDs can be modulated through elaborate surface coatings and that the CdTe/CdS/ZnS core-shell-shell structured QDs directly synthesized in aqueous phase are highly promising biological fluorescent probes for cellular imaging.",

GO is an oxide form of graphene that provides an ideal platform to prepare graphene-based functional nanomaterials via chemical modification. The PEG bridge was introduced to prevent GO-induced quenching of conjugated fluorescein. The fluorescein-PEG-GO conjugate thus prepared exhibits excellent pH-tunable fluorescent properties and, more significantly, can be efficiently taken up by cells and serve as a fluorescent nanoprobe for intracellular imaging.",

Along with wide ranging bioapplications, concerns about their biosafety have attracted increasingly intensive attentions. In comparison to full investigation of in vitro toxicity, there has been only scanty information regarding in vivo toxicity of the QDs. Particularly, while in vivo toxicity of organic synthesized QDs (orQDs) have been investigated recently, there exist no comprehensive studies concerning in vivo behavior of aqueous synthesized QDs (aqQDs) up to present. Herein, we investigate short- and long-term in vivo biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of the aqQDs. Particularly, the aqQDs are initially accumulated in liver after short-time (0.5-4 h) post-injection, and then are increasingly absorbed by kidney during long-time (15-80 days) blood circulation. Moreover, obviously size-dependent biodistribution is observed: aqQDs with larger sizes are more quickly accumulated in the spleen. Furthermore, histological and biochemical analysis, and body weight measurement demonstrate that there is no overt toxicity of aqQDs in mice even at long-time exposure time. Our studies provide invaluable information for the design and development of aqQDs for biological and biomedical applications.",

Assembled with Au nanoparticles, the prepared Au-DNA-graphene nanocomplex exhibits excellent stability that could prevent the nanocomplex from being destroyed by surfactants.

Here we report a new strategy based on nano rolling-circle amplification (nanoRCA) and nano hyperbranched rolling-circle amplification (nanoHRCA) to increase \"hot spot\" groups for protein microarrays. First, protein and ssDNA are coassembled on gold nanoparticles, making the assembled probe have both binding ability and hybridization ability. Second, the ssDNAs act as primers to initiate in situ RCA reaction to produced long ssDNAs. Third, a large number of SERS probes are loaded on the long ssDNA templetes, allowing thousands of SERS probes involved in each biomolecular recognition event. The strategy offered high-efficiency Raman enhancement and could detect less than 10 zeptomolar protein molecules in protein microarray analysis.",

        "abstract": "Multi-walled carbon nanotubes named CNTan, CNTox, and CNTir were prepared by high temperature annealing, acid oxidation and gamma irradiation, respectively. Their morphology, metal contents and surface properties were characterized by a series of techniques. The effects of surface hydrophilicity on their cell uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity were evaluated by radio-labeling techniques and several biological assays. Results showed that the CNTs possess similar diameters, lengths and metal contents, but different surface hydrophilicity. All of these CNT samples were readily taken up by Hela cells within 2 h, and their cell uptake ratio showed a positive correlation with their surface hydrophilicity in the following order: CNTir>CNTox>CNTan. Among these CNT samples, CNTan exhibited the lowest cytotoxicity to Hela cells due to its severe agglomeration. Although the cell uptake efficiency of CNTir was greater than that of CNTox, their cytotoxicity showed no significant difference, and other factors such as serum protein coating, and incubation time could also influence their cytotoxicity. These conclusions demonstrated that surface hydrophilicity of MWCNTs could alter their cell uptake efficiency, underlining the possibility for rational design of CNT-specific surface properties for their further development in biomedical fields and a mechanistic understanding of observed CNT toxicity. \u00a9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

        "abstract": "This work reported the systematic influence of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) with a diameter of 3 nm on mice. Mice were repeated intratracheally instilled with TiO2 NPs, once per-week for 4 consecutive weeks, at total dose of 13.2 mg/kg. At 28 days post-instillation, the biochemical parameters in broncboalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and brain homogenate as well as histopathologic changes of tissues were examined to describe the subacute toxicity of instilled TiO2 NPs. The results showed that instilled TiO2 NPs could induce lung damage, and change the permeability of alveolar-capillary barrier. The TiO2 NPs were able to get access to blood circulation and reach extrapulmonary tissues, then lead to injury at the different level, such as liver and kidney. Our results also indicated that TiO2 NPs might pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and induce the brain injury through oxidative stress response.",

The arrival time of the donor fluorescence varies with the distribution of the excitation laser. The differences of the arrival times between different positions in the excitation spot can be further enhanced in the case of adding a depletion beam upon the FRET probes. The spatial information is encoded in the temporal dynamics of the fluorescent photons from donor molecules and time-gating in detection can be used to increase the spatial resolution. ",

This pomegranate-shaped silver NPAs functionalized cotton fabric exhibits outstanding antibacterial activities and also excellent laundering durability, where it can inactivate higher than 90% of both E. coli and S. aureus even after 50 accelerated laundering cycles, which is equivalent to 250 commercial or domestic laundering cycles.",

        "abstract": "Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are often used as vehicles to deliver drugs or biomolecules, due to their mild effect on cell survival and proliferation. However, little is known about their effect on cellular metabolism. Here we examine the in vivo effect of AuNPs on metabolism using Drosophila as a model. Drosophila and vertebrates possess similar basic metabolic functions, and a highly conserved PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway plays a central role in the regulation of energy metabolism in both organisms. We show that dietary AuNPs enter the fat body, a key metabolic tissue in Drosophila larvae. Significantly, larvae fed with AuNP show increased lipid levels without triggering stress responses. In addition, activities of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and fatty acids synthesis are increased in these larvae. This study thus reveals a novel function of AuNPs in influencing animal metabolism and suggests its potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders.",

        "abstract": "Monovalent DNA\u2013gold nanoparticle (mDNA\u2013AuNP) conjugates hold great promise for widespread applications, especially the construction of well-defined, molecule-like nanosystems. Previously reported methods all rely on the use of thiolated DNA to functionalize AuNPs, resulting in relatively low yields. Here, we report a facile method to rapidly prepare mDNA\u2013AuNPs using a poly-adenine (polyA)-mediated approach. As polyA can selectively bind to AuNPs with high controllability of the surface density of DNA, we can use a DNA strand with a sufficiently long polyA to wrap around the surface of an individual AuNP, preventing further the adsorption of additional strands. Based on this observation, we obtained mDNA\u2013AuNPs with a nearly quantitative yield of ~90% using 80 As, as confirmed by both gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscope observation. The yields of mDNA\u2013AuNPs were insensitive to the stoichiometric ratio between DNA and AuNPs, suggesting the click chemistry-like nature of this polyA-mediated reaction. mDNA\u2013AuNPs exhibited rapid kinetics and high efficiency for sequence-specific hybridization. More importantly, we demonstrated that AuNPs of fixed valences could form well-defined heterogenous oligomeric nanostructures with precise, atom-like control.",

Recently, graphene (a two-dimensional nanomaterial) was shown to have antibacterial activity on Escherichia coli, but its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show experimentally and theoretically that pristine graphene and graphene oxide nanosheets can induce the degradation of the inner and outer cell membranes of Escherichia coli, and reduce their viability. Transmission electron microscopy shows three rough stages, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the atomic details of the process. Graphene nanosheets can penetrate into and extract large amounts of phospholipids from the cell membranes because of the strong dispersion interactions between graphene and lipid molecules. This destructive extraction offers a novel mechanism for the molecular basis of graphene's cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity.",

On the other side the influences of C60-dexamethasone on the learning function and the immunosuppression activity were much lower than that of dexamethasone.

        "abstract": "Duckweeds are a common macrophyte in paddy and aquatic environments. Here, we investigated arsenic (As) accumulation, speciation and tolerance of the rootless duckweed Wolffia globosa and its potential for As phytofiltration. When grown with 1 microm arsenate, W. globosa accumulated two to 10 times more As than four other duckweed or Azolla species tested. W. globosa was able to accumulate > 1000 mg As kg(-1) in frond dry weight (DW), and tolerate up to 400 mg As kg(-1) DW. At the low concentration range, uptake rate was similar for arsenate and arsenite, but at the high concentration range, arsenite was taken up at a faster rate. Arsenite was the predominant As species (c. 90% of the total extractable As) in both arsenate- and arsenite-exposed duckweed. W. globosa was more resistant to external arsenate than arsenite, but showed a similar degree of tolerance internally. W. globosa decreased arsenate in solution rapidly, but also effluxed arsenite. Wolffia globosa is a strong As accumulator and an interesting model plant to study As uptake and metabolism because of the lack of a root-to-frond translocation barrier.",

The results confirm the presence of a single sheet of DMF-rGO with PVP of 42%. This kind of chemically reduced GO has a greater solubility in water and also is more biocompatible than rGO reduced by hydrazine hydrate. This method is simple, environmentally friendly and the composite has potential applications in biology and polymer nanocomposites.",

        "abstract": "In addition to its fundamental function as a genetic code carrier, the utilization of DNA in various material applications has been actively explored over the past several decades. DNA is intrinsically an excellent type of self-assembly nanomaterial owing to its predictable base-pairing, high chemical stability and the convenience it possesses for synthesis and modification. Because of these unparalleled properties, DNA is widely used as excellent recognition elements in biosensors and as unique building blocks in nanodevices. A critical challenge in surface-based DNA biosensors lies in the reduced accessibility of target molecules to the DNA probes arranged on heterogeneous surfaces, especially when compared to probe\u2013target recognition in homogeneous solutions. To improve the recognition abilities of these heterogeneous surface-confined DNA probes, much effort has been devoted to controlling the surface chemistry, conformation and packing density of the probe molecules, as well as the size and geometry of the surface. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent progress on the improvement of the probe\u2013target recognition properties by introducing DNA nanostructure scaffolds. A range of new strategies have proven to provide a significantly enhanced range in the spatial positioning and the accessibility of the probes to the surface over previously reported linear structures. We will also describe the applications of DNA nanostructure scaffold-based biosensors.",

We found that the presence of arm strands in TDNs remarkably enhanced their in vitro stability, allowing them to stay intact for at least 12 h in serum. By using NIR fluorescence imaging, we evaluated in mice the pharmacokinetics of TDNs, which exhibited distinctly different in vivo biodistribution patterns compared with those of double-stranded (ds)DNA. We also noticed that TDNs had twofold longer circulation time in the blood system than that of dsDNA. With the use of multiple-armed TDNs, we could precisely anchor an exact number of functional groups including tumor-targeting folic acid (FA), NIR emitter Dylight 755, and radioactive isotope 99mTc on prescribed positions of TDNs, which showed the capability of targeted imaging ability in cancer cells. Furthermore, we realized noninvasive tumor-...",

        "abstract": "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have emerged as a promising bactericide. Plants are a major point of entry of contaminants into trophic chains. Here, the physiological responses of Wolffia globosa to AgNPs have been probed using different light schemes, and these data may reveal new insights into the toxic mechanism of AgNPs. W. globosa was grown in culture medium and treated with different concentrations of AgNPs for 24h under pre- and post-illuminated conditions. However, fluorescence quenching, the accumulation of sugar and the reduction of Hill reaction activity were found in response to the AgNP-stresses. In the pre-illuminated condition, oxidative damage was obvious, as indicated by the higher malondialdehyde (MDA) content and an up-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The maximum increases of MDA content and SOD activity were 1.14 and 2.52 times the respective controls when exposed to 10mg/L AgNPs. In contrast, in the post-illuminated condition, the alterations in photosynthetic pigment and soluble proteins content were more significant than the alterations in oxidative stress. The contents of chlorophyll a, carotenoids and soluble protein decreased to 77.7%, 66.2% and 72.9% of the controls after treatment with the highest concentration of AgNPs (10mg/L). Based on the different physiological responses, we speculated that in the pre-illuminated condition, oxidative stress was responsible for the decline in the oxygen evolution rate, while in the post-illuminated condition, the decrease in the Hill reaction activity could be attributed to the blocking of electron transfer and an insufficient proton supply. Our findings demonstrate that environmental factors regulate the physiological responses of plants to AgNPs through distinct mechanisms. ",

The impacts of surfactant type (including nonionic-, anionic-, cationic- and bio-surfactant) on the ionic liquid pretreatment were investigated. The bio-surfactant+IL-pretreated rice straw showed significant lignin removal (26.14%) and exhibited higher cellulose conversion (36.21%) than the untreated (16.16%) rice straw. The cellulose conversion of the rice straw pretreated with bio-surfactant+IL was the highest and the lowest was observed for pretreated with cationic-surfactant+IL. Untreated and pretreated rice straw was thoroughly characterized through SEM and AFM. In conclusion, the results provided an effective and environmental method for pretreating lignocellulosic substrates by using green solvent (ionic liquid) and biodegradable bio-surfactant.",

HTA426 was purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography, with the recovery yield and fold purification of 10.14% and 5.12, respectively. The purified cellulase has a molecular weight of 40 kDa. The optimum temperature and pH for carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) activity of the purified cellulase were 60\u00b0C and pH 7.0, respectively. The enzyme was also stable over a wide temperature range of 50\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C after 5 h of incubation. Moreover, the strain HTA426 was able to grow and produce cellulase on alkali-treated sugarcane bagasse, rice straw and water hyacinth as carbon sources. Enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse, which was regarded as the most effective carbon source for cellulase production (CMCase activity = 103.67 U/mL), followed by rice straw (74.70 U/mL) and water hyacinth (51.10 U/mL). This strain producing an efficient thermostable cellulose is a potential candidate for developing a more efficient and cost-effective process for converting lignocellulosic biomass into biofuel and other industrial process.",

SEM and other analytic methods were used to study the phase composition and the microstructure of the nanoparticles.The influence of the ratio of zirconium to boron and carbon on the purity of ZrB2 powders, as well as the synthesis temperature and the holding time were studied. Pure ZrB2 at the molar ratio of C/Zr/B=10/5.2/1 can be obtained. The optimum parameter for microwave sintering is 1320 \u00b0C for 1h, which is about 300\u00b0C lower than conventional carbonization reduction to obtain ZrB2 powders.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Reduced-activation ferritic-martensitic (RAFM) steels, candidate structural materials for fusion reactors, have achieved technological maturity after about three decades of research and development. The recent status of a few developmental aspects of current RAFM steels, such as aging resistance, plate thickness effects, fracture toughness, and fatigue, is updated in this paper, together with ongoing efforts to develop next-generation RAFM steels for superior high-temperature performance. In addition to thermomechanical treatments, including nonstandard heat treatment, alloy chemistry refinements and modifications have demonstrated some improvements in high-temperature performance. Castable nanostructured alloys (CNAs) were developed by significantly increasing the amount of nanoscale MX (M\u00a0=\u00a0V/Ta/Ti, X\u00a0=\u00a0C/N) precipitates and reducing coarse M 23 C 6  (M\u00a0=\u00a0Cr). Preliminary results showed promising improvement in creep resistance and Charpy impact toughness. Limited low-dose neutron irradiation results for one of the CNAs and China low activation martensitic are presented and compared with data for F82H and Eurofer97 irradiated up to \u223c70 displacements per atom at \u223c300\u2013325\u00a0\u00b0C.",

        "abstract": "Our first-principles calculations indicate the defective properties of Cr2AlC are very different from the commonly studied Ti-based MAX phases. Al vacancies are predicted to have high formation energies while Cr vacancies have low formation energies in Cr2AlC. Compared with previously reported results of MAX phases, the formation energy of the anion antisite defect pair in Cr2AlC is the lowest (\u223c1.9 eV), predicting a good irradiation-resistance property. The reduction in the formation energy of the Cr\u2013Al antisite defect is attributed to the magnetic ordering and strong correlation effect of Cr atoms. Analysis suggests that the majority spin state of the dz2 orbital of Cr is lowered in energy while the minority spin states become empty, which makes the Cr more ionic in character.",

        "abstract": "Plasmonic core@satellites nanostructures comprising strongly coupled Au-nanoparticles as building blocks have drawn a lot of attention because of the optical application, e.g. surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based signal amplification. However, little has been reported on the core@satellites structures related to Ag-nanoparticles and the SERS enhancement from a singular core@satellites assembling. Here, we show the DNA assisted assembly of core@satellites, consisting of Ag-nanocube core and small Au-nanosphere satellites. For each core@satellites unit, an Ag-nanocube as a core is assembled with randomly distributed Au-nanospheres as satellites. In this way, abundant hot spots are formed at the sharp edged Ag-nanocube and the nanoscaled gaps between the Ag-nanocube core and the Au-nanosphere satellite. Raman measurements, atomic force microscope correlated Raman measurements and finite element modeling demonstrate that the Raman enhancement factor of the singular Ag-nanocube@Au-nanospheres core@satellites can be up to 3.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009108. The Ag-nanocube@Au-nanoparticles core@satellites with in-built electromagnetic hot-spots could be used as excellent SERS substrates for rapid ultrasensitive detection of organic pollutants in the environment.

It is clarified that the paramagnetic neutral C B V N  center is stable in the  n -type  h -BN monolayer. The neutral defect center possesses a triplet (S\u00a0=\u00a01) ground state and with two spin-conserved optical vertical transition. Its spin coherence time is estimated to be 3.9\u00a0ms at T\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0K by a simple scheme combining the mean-field theory and the first-principles calculations.

        "abstract": "Abstract   As one of the MAX phases, Ti 2 AlC combines attractive properties of both ceramics and metals, and has been suggested for potential nuclear reactor applications due to its excellent resistance to irradiation. This work is aimed at investigating the high temperature effects on evolution of irradiation damage in the MAX phase Ti 2 AlC. Ti 2 AlC was irradiated with 1.1\u00a0MeV C 4+  ions at 298\u00a0K and 873\u00a0K with fluences ranging from 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 15 \u00a0cm \u22122  to 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 16 \u00a0cm \u22122 . Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectra, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nanoindentation were used to characterize the evolution of microstructures and mechanical properties at both temperatures. Significant crackings along grain boundaries were observed in 298\u00a0K, which were not observed in the samples irradiated at 837\u00a0K. No amorphization was found in the GIXRD analyses and TEM characterization, and some fcc phases were formed during high dose irradiation at 298\u00a0K. Raman spectra show that all the vibration modes of Ti 2 AlC decreased severely in room temperature irradiation, but they nearly remained unchanged in high temperature irradiation at the dose of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 15 \u00a0cm \u22122 . Nanoindentation shows significant hardening for Ti 2 AlC irradiated at high temperature, suggesting the presence of irradiation-induced defects. The current study reveals that the irradiation tolerance of Ti 2 AlC is significantly improved with increasing temperature, demonstrating the great potential of Ti 2 AlC for using in advanced nuclear reactors.",

The irradiated region of 4H-SiC is peeled off by the molten salt, and the corrosion depth is nearly consistent with the irradiation damage depth. Molten salt corrosion leads to the loss of Si element and the formation of carbon-rich phase in irradiated 4H-SiC surface. The broken of Si-C bonds induced by irradiation plays a key role in the irradiation-assisted corrosion of SiC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A prototype of label-free SERS sensor, based on the formation of T-Hg 2+ -T pairs and the corresponding orientation variation of DNA on Au shell surface, was developed for detection of Hg 2+  in aqueous solution quantitatively and selectively. The DNA aptamer immobilized on the surface of SiO 2 @Au core/shell nanoparticles (NPs) consisted of two segments, namely, the segment which has the consecutive thymines (T) severing as the Hg 2+  recognition elements, and the segment which contains the guanine (G) and adenine (A) bases working as the signal reporter. With interaction of Hg 2+  ions and the thymines between the adjacent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), the DNA molecule adopted vertical orientation, resulting in increase of Raman intensity ratio I(660\u00a0cm \u22121 )/I(736\u00a0cm \u22121 ) with increase of Hg 2+  concentration, which thus allowed to measure trace amounts of Hg 2+  in aqueous solution selectively and quantitatively. Our results revealed that this label-free SERS sensor could sensitively respond to Hg 2+  ions within a wide concentration range (from 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128  to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22123 \u00a0M). This work therefore demonstrates that proper design of aptamer-modified SiO 2 @Au core/shell NPs can be utilized for label-free SERS detection of heavy metal ions in the environment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Understanding the mechanism of ion-solid interactions and the responses of materials to energetic ion irradiation is fundamentally important to study the irradiation-damage behaviors and evaluate the irradiation-damage tolerances of functional materials working in artificial and natural radiation environments. In this work, an approach utilizing low- and high-energy ion irradiation is utilized to study the coupling effect between nuclear collision and electronic excitation related to an ion-irradiation-induced damage event. Microstructural analysis shows that, compared to the damage-free crystal, electronic excitation induces more considerable irradiation damage in the nuclear-collision-damaged crystal. Utilizing the inelastic thermal spike model, the evolution of the lattice temperature is calculated, revealing that, compared to the damage-free crystal, the local energy diffusion in the nuclear-collision-damaged crystal is suppressed and the irradiation-damage level is increased. This should be attributed to the decrease of the thermal conductivity and increase of the electron-phonon coupling in the nuclear-collision-damaged region.",

To further improve their antibacterial activity, many methods have been developed to functionalize the GMs with chemicals. However, the application of additional chemicals may pose potential risks to the environment and human being. Herein, a radio-frequency-driven inductively coupled non-thermal hydrogen plasma was used to treat and reduce graphene oxide (GO) without using any other chemicals, and we found that the plasma-reduced GO (prGO) is with significantly higher bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli. The mechanism of the increased antibacterial activity of prGO is due to that plasma processing breaks down the GO sheets into smaller layers with more rough surface defects, which can thus induce more destructive membrane damages to the bacteria. This work sets another good example, showing that plasma processing is a gre...",

The number densities and sizes of He bubbles increase with increasing irradiation dose. Neither \u201cblack spots\u201d nor dislocation loops were observed in TEM images of the as-irradiated samples. Irradiation dose up to 6.18 displacements per atom (dpa) causes a swelling of 2.67%, which is mainly ascribed to He bubbles. He bubbles induced hardening increases with increasing irradiation dose. The irradiation hardening behavior was compared with heavy ion irradiation. The result reveals that the obstacle strength of He bubbles is less than that of the saturated heavy ion induced irradiation defects.",

TEM results reveal that 3C-SiC grains were surrounded by the carbon ribbons. The size of 3C-SiC grains first decreases and then increases with increasing ion fluence. Raman spectra display that SiC fiber consists of both 3C-SiC and abundant graphite phase. A redshift of the vibration mode of 3C-SiC in the fibers occured as compared with that of standard bulk 3C-SiC. Meanwhile, 4H-SiC phase was observed after irradiation. Furthermore, scattering intensity of all peaks in Raman spectra first reduces and then increases with increasing ion fluence, indicating that damage accumulates at low fluences and subsequently recovers to some extent at higher fluences. SEM results exhibit that the diameter of SiC fibers first shrinks and then expands, simultaneously, carbon concentration on fibers surface decreases while silicon concentration increases gradually, with increasing ion fluence, accompanied by an adsorption of oxygen.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A novel, easy and cost-effective way, infiltration and pyrolysis of phenolic resin solution, was exploited to prepare pyrolytic carbon (PyC) interlayers for carbon fiber/silicon carbide (Cf/SiC) mini-composites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, dynamic contact angle measurement and scanning electron microscope were carried out to characterize chemical structure of carbon fibers (CFs), wetting properties between CFs and phenolic resin solution and microstructure of CFs and their composites, respectively. Remarkably, SEM results showed regulation of uniformity and thicknesses of PyC interlayer could be achieved through controlling the concentration of phenolic resin solution and oxidation condition of CFs. When CFs were treated by 10\u202fminu0027 oxidation with 40\u202fmg/L ozone followed by dip-coating with 4\u202fwt% phenolic solution, uniform PyC interlayer with approximately 120\u202fnm were prepared on CFs. The corresponding Cf/SiC specimens had the largest increase in tensile strength and work of fracture with the improvement of 26.2% and 71.6% from the PyC-free case.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, the waveguide formation mechanism and related optical properties in strontium titanate crystal irradiated with 357\u202fMeV Ni-ion at a fluence of 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 13 \u202fcm \u22122  have been studied. The electronic energy loss along the swift heavy ion penetration path could produce lattice damage based on the inelastic thermal spike model, and therefore modify the refractive index distribution and further induce a waveguide formation. Irradiation damage behavior in the near-surface region has been analyzed by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in a channeling direction. Optical properties of the prepared strontium titanate waveguide at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, including the guided mode, near-field intensity distribution and transmission loss, have been characterized by prism and end-face coupling measurements. Due to the relatively deep penetration of the swift heavy ions, the formed waveguide structure could effectively support multi-mode and single-mode transmissions in the visible and near-infrared regions, respectively. Utilizing the measured effective refractive indices of guided modes, the refractive index profile of the irradiation region has been reconstructed by the inverse Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method, further proving that the electronic energy loss induced by swift heavy ion irradiation plays a dominant role in the formation of strontium titanate waveguides.",

The intrinsic dislocations are decorated with irradiation induced interstitial loops and/or clusters. Moreover, the intrinsic dislocations density reduces as the irradiation damage increases. The disappearance of the intrinsic dislocations is ascribed to the dislocations climb to the free surface by the absorption of interstitials under the ion irradiation. Moreover, the in situ annealing experiment reveals that the small interstitial loops and/or clusters induced by the ion irradiation are stable below 600\u00a0\u00b0C.",

A ultra-thin alumina middle space-layer is then conformally coated on the Au/Ag-nanospheres, and Ag-nanoparticles are finally deposited on the surface of the alumina space-layer to form an ordered array of Au/Ag-nanosphere@Al2O3-layer@Ag-nanoparticles.

A IG-110 graphite sample was irradiated with 2.5-MeV protons to a fluence of 1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 18 \u00a0ions/cm 2  at room temperature. Proton irradiation produced a damaged layer with a thickness of \u223c75\u00a0\u03bcm. A scan of Raman spectrum was performed on cross section of irradiated sample. Analysis of the Raman spectra indicates that the graphite breaks into nano-crystalline graphite at very low dose (0.02\u20130.04\u00a0dpa) during room-temperature irradiation. Nano-indentation tests were performed on the cross section of irradiated sample so that the damage along the loading direction is uniform. Thus, it was able to identify a dpa value for the nano-indentation tests. Using this method, the modulus at 0.015\u00a0dpa was deduced to be 2.39 times that of the un-irradiated graphite. The hardness is also more than doubled after irradiation to 0.015\u00a0dpa.",

The excess of B was essential to remove the carbon produced by the reaction. The degassing process at 1900\u00a0\u00b0C before applying a 50\u00a0MPa external pressure greatly improved the densification of the composites. The B 4 C\u201341\u00a0vol% TiB 2  composite obtained at the optimum condition had a high 3-point bending strength of 891\u00a0MPa, a Vickers hardness of 28\u00a0GPa and a fracture toughness of 4.4\u00a0MPa\u00a0m 1/2 , respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The GH3535 alloy was irradiated with 7\u00a0MeV Xe 26+  ions to a dose of 10 dpa at room temperature (RT) and 650\u00a0\u00b0C, and subsequently examined using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and nanoindentation. High numbers of nano-sized black dots, identified as dislocation loops were observed in both irradiated samples. The dislocation loops detected at the high temperature irradiated sample (size/number density: 9.5\u00a0nm/1.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 21 \u00a0m \u22123 ) were found to be larger in size but less in amount as compared to that of the case of RT irradiation (6.9\u00a0nm/18.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 21 \u00a0m \u22123 ). In addition, the large-sized Mo-Cr rich precipitates (16.4\u00a0nm/3.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 21 \u00a0m \u22123 ) were observed in the sample irradiated at 650\u00a0\u00b0C. Moreover, the Xe bubbles, with smaller size (2.9\u00a0nm) but higher number density (77.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 21 \u00a0m \u22123 ) among the irradiated induced defects, were also detected in the case of high temperature irradiated sample via the diffusion and aggregation of Xe atoms. Nanoindentaion measurements showed a hardening phenomenon for the irradiated sample, and the hardness increment is higher in the case of high temperature irradiated sample. Dispersed barrier-hardening (DBH) model was applied to predict the hardening produced from the irradiation induced defects. The yield strength increment calculated based on TEM observations and the nanohardness increment measured using nanoindentation are in excellent agreement.",

In this work, a computer model is established to simulate the hydration and leaching of MOC paste at the micro-scale. The composition of MOC paste in the ultimate hydration is investigated based on the thermodynamic method, and pore structure obtained from the computer simulation is compared with the one from experiments and literature, respectively. The simulated leaching results show that the original solid phase skeleton of MOC paste decomposes into magnesium hydroxide crystals. It is demonstrated that the simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data from literature and the proposed simulation can provide an effective method to reveal the hydration and leaching mechanism of MOC paste.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   High-temperature helium ion irradiation was conducted on a nickel-based alloy at 650\u2009\u00b0C. A unique outward migration of helium bubbles was observed in the irradiated alloy under molten salt environment, distinguished from the evolution of helium bubbles induced by room-temperature irradiation, which is related to the deficit of vacancies in the high-temperature irradiated alloy and slow growth rate of the bubbles. Moreover, it was elucidated that corrosion induced vacancies rather than high-temperature annealing effect of molten salt is responsible for the evolution of helium bubbles formed by high-temperature helium ion irradiation.",

It is proved that reliable size distribution of pores can be derived by processing optical images of graphite. The results were compared with those obtained from mercury porosimetry test and X-ray tomography. Optical microscopy showed that the majority of IG-110\u2019s (T220\u2019s) porosity is contributed by pores with sizes around 13 (3) \u00b5m, which was confirmed by X-ray tomography for IG-110. But, mercury porosimetry test indicated that pores with sizes around 2.3 (0.9) \u00b5m contribute the majority of IG-110\u2019s (T220\u2019s) porosity. The difference between mercury porosimetry and the other two techniques suggests that the graphite pores are connected by relatively thinner channels.",

Herein, we report a one-step technique to controllably manufacture 3D micro/nanopatterned structures with tunable work functions in silicon carbide (SiC). The multiscale micro/nanopatterned structures were produced directly by ion beam irradiation-induced swelling with the assistance of masks. The minimum feature size was \u223c52\u202fnm and the swelling height could be controlled flexibly from \u223c1 to \u223c250\u202fnm. The change of work function of the 3D SiC micro/nanostructures could be tuned in the range between 0 and \u223c126.6\u202fmeV. Distinct rectifying junction behavior was demonstrated between the irradiated and unirradiated zones. The Youngu0027s modulus and hardness values of the irradiated zones stabilized at \u223c298.1\u202fGPa and \u223c24.9\u202fGPa, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Compared with the pattern recognition of discrete human motions, the continuous human motion estimation is more significant for the motion control of wearable power-assisted robots. In previous studies, researchers estimated human motion from the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal based on the Hill-type muscle model or using the traditional machine learning algorithms with the hand-crafted features. However, these methods generally require the domain knowledge about the muscle dynamics or complicated signal processing. In this study, 3-channel time series mechanomyography (MMG) signals were detected on clothes from the thigh muscles, and a CNN-SVM combined regression model was proposed to estimate the knee angle under different motion velocities. The convolutional neural network (CNN) model was used to automatically extract the features from the MMG signals, and the support vector machine (SVM) regression was used to process the features for angle estimation. The results showed that the CNN-SVM combined regression model obviously improved the estimation performances and avoided using the muscle model or hand-crafted features. The methods used in this paper would promote the development of motion control system for wearable power-assisted robots, and could be further extended to the fields of rehabilitation training, medical diagnosis, etc.",

        "abstract": "Degradable energy storage systems (ESSs) have been proposed to tackle increasing e-wastes such as heavy metals and toxic organic electrolytes. However, currently reported degradable ESSs are scarce because it is very difficult to make all of the electrochemical components degradable as they must be stable for energy storage. Here, we designed an all-component degradable and rechargeable Zn-MXene capacitor with outstanding anti-self-discharge function using zinc nanosheets and TiC MXene as electrodes. The whole capacitor can retain ca. 82.5% of the capacitance after 1000 cycles and be totally degraded within 7.25 days, comprehensively surpassing the current degradable supercapacitors (120 days, 400 cycles) and batteries (19 days, 0-20 cycles). In addition, while supercapacitors are notorious for intensive self-discharge, the Zn-MXene capacitor demonstrated the lowest self-discharge rate of 6.4 mV h, better than all the previous supercapacitors with specifically designed anti-self-discharge components including electrodes (>300 mV h), electrolytes (12-50 mV h), and separators (20-400 mV h). This is illustrated by the as-proposed \"static electricity-immune mechanism\" which refers to breaking the electrostatic adsorption. This Zn-MXene capacitor represents a great advance in degradable rechargeable ESSs and provides a strategy to fundamentally overcome the self-discharge problem encountered by supercapacitors.",

The devised system consists of Ag-nanorod (Ag-NR) arrays with the PCB-77 binding aptamers anchored covalently to the Ag surfaces through a thiol linker. The aptamers are made of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligomers, with one end standing on the Ag surface, and upon conjugation with PCB-77, the ssDNA molecules can change their conformation to hairpin loops, so that the Raman intensity of guanines at the other end of the DNA strand increases accordingly. As such, the intensity ratio I(656 cm\u20131)/I(733 cm\u20131) increases concomitantly with the increase of the concentration of PCB-77, making the quantitative evaluation of trace amounts of PCB-77 attainable.

Ab initio  calculations show that there exist rectifying behaviors for both 1D and 2D systems, and the Ti 2 CO 2  nanoribbon devices show stronger rectification ratio than the 2D counterpart. The current results indicate that V-doped and Sc-doped electrodes may be a practical way to achieve the current rectification of MXene devices.

        "abstract": "Herein, the cytocompatibility of selected MAX phases, Ti3AlC2, Ti3SiC2, and Ti2AlN, were systematically evaluated using in vitro tests for the first time. These phases were anoxic to preosteoblasts and fibroblasts. Compared with the strong viable fibroblasts, the different cellular responses of these materials were clearly distinguishable for the preosteoblasts. Under an osteoblastic environment, Ti2AlN exhibited better cell proliferation and differentiation performance than Ti3AlC2 and Ti3SiC2. Moreover, the performance was superior to that of a commercial Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy and comparable to that of pure Ti. A possible mechanism was suggested based on the different surface oxidation products, which were determined from the binding energy of adsorbed Ca2+ ions using first-principles calculations. Compared with the partially oxidized TiCxOy layer on Ti3AlC2 and Ti3SiC2, the partially oxidized TiNxOy layer on the Ti2AlN had a stronger affinity to the Ca2+ ions, which indicated the good cytocompatibility of Ti...",

        "abstract": "MXenes represent a new family of two-dimensional materials that have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Because of the remarkably different structures of Sc2C(OH)2 and Sc2CO2 MXene and their recently reported properties, this study explored the structural evolution and mechanism of chemical conversion between these two MXenes. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), the mechanism for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation is investigated by gradually removing/adding surface hydrogen atoms for Sc2C(OH)2/Sc2CO2 supercells. Employing three different supercells (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 and 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1), intermediate states Sc2C(OH)xO2\u2212x with varying hydrogen content x (0.0625\u2264x \u2264 1.94) are obtained. The results show that the trend is to minimize the difference in the number of hydrogen atoms and the distance between them on the two sides of the monolayer. This feature is found to be generally applicable to other functional groups of MXenes during surface conversion. Analysis of these structures shows that all the oxygen, carbon and scandium atoms remain in essentially the same locations as in Sc2C(OH)2 until atoms rearrange in the carbon layer at sufficiently low x. Regarding the electronic properties, the behavior of the rearranged configurations is found to depend on the structure, moving beyond the conventional model of p-type doping induced by dehydrogenation. Bipolar magnetic semiconductors (BMSs) are identified from these rearranged configurations by the inhomogeneous distribution of hydrogen atoms on the different sides and x values approximately in the range of 0.188 \u2264 x \u2264 0.812. Findings from this study suggest that the intrinsic spin-polarized semiconducting characteristics of Sc2C(OH)xO2\u2212x are expected to be experimentally observable if samples are prepared as nanoscale flakes. The current results indicate that Sc-based MXene may be a promising material for nanoscale spintronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A new multi-layered design of joining filler, consisting of a Ti 3 SiC 2  layer and an in-situ reaction TiC transition layer, was proposed to join monolithic SiC. The robust TiC transition layer was formed in-situ by controlling the interface reaction and diffusion process between the deposited Ti layer and the SiC matrix. The joining process was evaluated by the analysis of the interface reaction, phase evolution, mechanical properties, and finite element analysis. The bending strength of the sample joined at 1500\u202f\u00b0C was 155.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f23.1\u202fMPa, which was similar to that of the reference unjoined SiC (155.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f35.6\u202fMPa). The thermal residual stresses between SiC and Ti 3 SiC 2  were released by the formation of gradient layer of TiC at the interface. When the optimized joining approach was used, a dense TiC transition layer was formed and all brittle Ti-Si intermetallic phases completely transformed to Ti 3 SiC 2 . Furthermore, the proposed multi-layer joining design shows its potential to be used for joining of SiC-based ceramic matrix composites.",

        "abstract": "The two-dimensional materials MXenes have recently attracted interest for their excellent performance from diverse perspectives indicated by experiments and theoretical calculations. For the application of MXenes in electronic devices, the exploration of semiconducting MXenes arouses particular interest. In this work, despite the metallic properties of Sc3C2F2 and Sc3N2F2, we find that Sc3(CN)F2 is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.18 eV, which is an expansion of the semiconducting family members of MXene. Using first-principles calculations, the electrical and thermal properties of the semiconducting Sc3(CN)F2 MXene are studied. The electron mobilities are determined to possess strong anisotropy, while the hole mobilities show isotropy, i.e. 1.348 \u00d7 103 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 along x, 0.319 \u00d7 103 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 along the y directions for electron mobilities, and 0.517 \u00d7 103 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 along x, 0.540 \u00d7 103 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 along the y directions for hole mobilities. The room-temperature thermal conductivity along the \u0393 \u2192 M direction is determined to be 123\u2013283 W m\u22121 K\u22121 with a flake length of 1\u2013100 \u03bcm. Besides, Sc3(CN)F2 presents a relatively high specific heat of 547 J kg\u22121 K\u22121 and a low thermal expansion coefficient of 8.703 \u00d7 10\u22126 K\u22121. Our findings suggest that the Sc3(CN)F2 MXene might be a candidate material in the design and application of 2D nanoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract      For the long-term stable operation of the entrained flow gasifier in the coal chemical industry, the flux agents are generally adopted to adjust the fusibility of coal ash. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanism for the impact of typical oxide flux agents on viscosity temperature properties of coal ash from structures and thermodynamics. In this work, the role of calcium oxide, sodium oxide and ferrous oxide on viscosity temperature properties is investigated by a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic calculations. The variations of viscosity and temperature of critical viscosity are obtained for different ternary coal ash systems by thermodynamic calculation. Ternary phase diagrams are applied to evaluate the effect of different flux agents, which are also found to cause mineral transformation from high-temperature minerals to low-temperature minerals. Oxygen bond species are employed as the indicator of the structural evolution originating from addition of different flux agents. The sodium atoms may more readily weaken the tricluster oxygen bonds than calcium or ferrous atoms according to the results. Higher content of bridging oxygen bonds in the sodium oxide ternary coal ash system can enhance the stability of the structures and induce higher viscosity. Stability coefficients are defined here and a function to describe the relationship between the viscosity and flux agent content is established. The results from the current work are expected to provide new clues to find strategies controlling the fusion behaviour of coal ash systems.",

        "abstract": "Nanolaminated materials are important because of their exceptional properties and wide range of applications. Here, we demonstrate a general approach to synthesize a series of Zn-based MAX phases and Cl-terminated MXenes originating from the replacement reaction between the MAX phase and the late transition metal halides. The approach is a top-down route that enables the late transitional element atom (Zn in the present case) to occupy the A site in the pre-existing MAX phase structure. Using this replacement reaction between Zn element from molten ZnCl2 and Al element in MAX phase precursors (Ti3AlC2, Ti2AlC, Ti2AlN, and V2AlC), novel MAX phases Ti3ZnC2, Ti2ZnC, Ti2ZnN, and V2ZnC were synthesized. When employing excess ZnCl2, Cl terminated MXenes (such as Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti2CCl2) were derived by a subsequent exfoliation of Ti3ZnC2 and Ti2ZnC due to the strong Lewis acidity of molten ZnCl2. These results indicate that A-site element replacement in traditional MAX phases by late transition metal halides opens the door to explore MAX phases that are not thermodynamically stable at high temperature and would be difficult to synthesize through the commonly employed powder metallurgy approach. Moreover, the etching effect of Lewis acid in molten salts provides a clean and safe chemistry for the delamination of MAX phase to obtain MXene when compared with the commonly used HF-etching process.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies predict pressure-induced superlubricity, but that is still undetermined due to absence of probing technique. Here, we present an unprecedented mutual identification between the superlubricity and atomic-scale image from Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurement by the first-principles simulation of metallic Cu tip scanning on carbon nanostructures. With the tip height decreasing, the sliding potential evolves from anticorrugated, to substantially flattened, and eventually to corrugated patterns, inducing superlubricity of flatten potential at the critical height. Correspondingly, both the normal forces and the contrast of atomic image patterns also undergo similar inversions at the respective critical tip heights in accord with recent experimental observation. Based on the underlying mechanism elucidated, the mutual identification between the images contrast inversion and the superlubricity is confirmed. This may advance the AFM technology to stimulate the experimental observation of superlubricity from its theoretical studies, and may thus promote the development of theory systems of superlubticity.",

The lattice parameters of U3Si and USi2 are calculated and the stability of different types of point defects is predicted by their formation energies. The results show that silicon vacancies are more prone to be produced than uranium vacancies in b{eta}-USi2 matrix, while uranium vacancies are the most stable defects of other three types of crystallographic structures. The most favorable sites of fission products (strontium, barium, cerium and neodymium) are determined in this work as well. By calculating incorporation energies of fission products, we demonstrate that the uranium site is the most favored for all the fissions products. Comparing the structural changes influenced by different fission products, it is also found that the highest volume change is caused by barium interstitials. According to the current data, rare earth elements cerium and neodymium are found to be more stable than alkaline earth metals strontium and barium in a given nuclear matrix. Finally, it is also determined that in USi2 crystal lattice fission products tend to be stabilized in uranium substitution sites, while they are likely to form precipitates from the U3Si matrix. It is expected that this work may provide new insight into the mechanism for structural evolutions of silicide nuclear fuels in a reactor.",

The results show that SO2 and N2O molecules prefer to occupy the large cages (LCs) of sI and sII hydrates, and H2S and NO molecules almost have no preference to cage types, whereas the CS2 molecule can only enter the LCs of the sII hydrate. The adsorption isotherms are used to predict the gas hydrate phase equilibria by statistical thermodynamics, which are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. The dissociation pressures of these clathrate hydrates at given temperatures are in the order: NO u003e N2O u003e H2S u003e SO2.

        "abstract": "The (Zr1-xTx)3Al3C5 (T=Hf, Nb, and V) series can be potential candidates to extend the domain of MAX phases. In this work, the structures and properties of (Zr1-xTx)3Al3C5 (T=Hf, Nb, and V) are studied using first-principles calculations. The obtained structural parameters are in good accordance with previously reported data in the literature. Based on the phase stability investigations, the potentially stable layered (Zr1-xTx)3Al3C5 (T=Hf, Nb, and V) solid solutions are proposed, which confirms that Zr3Al3C5 and Hf3Al3C5 can be synthesized. The substitution, especially with group VB transitional metals, endows layered (Zr1-xTx)3Al3C5 series with greatly enhanced mechanical and thermal properties. It is indicated that the bulk modulus B of all the three systems increase with increasing substitution concentration x. A significant increase in the ratio of bulk modulus to shear modulus, B/G, is found with increasing V concentration, which corresponds to the improved ductility. Moreover, solid solutions with V substitution, (Zr1-xVx)3Al3C5, yield a larger effect on thermal conductivity with respect to x, indicating flexible modulation of the thermal conductivity of (Zr1-xVx)3Al3C5 by V substitution can be achieved, which may promote them as promising coating materials. The intrinsic mechanism involved in the enhancements of the mechanical and thermal properties were elucidated through thorough electronic band structure analysis. The difference in the electronic structure and bonding between Zr and T in (Zr1-xTx)3Al3C5 compounds are shown to account for the abnormal variations in their properties.",

As-synthesized Ti3(AlxCu1-x)C2 presents unusual peroxidase-like catalytic activity similar to natural enzymes.

Using the  ab initio  calculations at the wB97X-D/6-311++G(2d,2p) level, we have investigated systematically the microstructures of five standard water cavities (ID, D, T, H and I) with single and multiple hydrogen sulfide inside. The interaction energies and deformation energies are predicted to ensure the stabilities and maximum occupancies of cages. In addition, the Gibbs free energies forming various water cavities enclosing CH 4  and H 2 S molecules at temperature range 253\u00a0K\u2013283\u00a0K are also calculated to explore the selectivity on hydrate types and corresponding formation conditions.

The electronic structures and mechanical properties of UAl 3 C 3  and U 2 Al 3 C 4  have been investigated by first-principles computations. The chemical bonding characteristics of UAl 3 C 3  and U 2 Al 3 C 4  have been compared to those of nanolaminated ternary carbides and strong interactions have been found between uranium and carbon atoms. Furthermore, UAl 3 C 3  and U 2 Al 3 C 4  powders have been fabricated by the solid state reaction method and the crystal structures of UAl 3 C 3  and U 2 Al 3 C 4  have been determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Based on the present results, the layered ternary carbides UAl 3 C 3  and U 2 Al 3 C 4  may provide an expansion of the derivative MAX phase (layered compounds) family as well as a new option for nuclear fuels.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The phase field formulation has been employed to investigate the abnormal grain growth behaviors for UO 2  with pores in the final stage of sintering. The microstructure evolution is found dependent on the total volume fraction and individual sizes of pores. The grain growth rate is evidently suppressed when the porosity is high and it is found independent of pore size at low porosity. Moreover, the smaller pores may cause worse abnormal grain growth at low porosities and more significant stagnation effect at high porosities in the sintering of UO 2 . By further inspection on pore-boundary interaction in a bi-grain system designed in this work, the grain growth behavior is determined to be strongly correlated to the engulfment of pores by grains which may be described by the critical grain radius and critical time defined hereby. The data obtained may provide a new insight into the mechanism behind the sintering technology of nuclear fuels such as UO 2 .",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The role of calcium oxide on ash fusion properties was investigated in this work by molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamics calculations. The variation of volume was used to identify the melting points, which was compared with the liquidus temperature calculated by the FactSage codes. The phase diagram was calculated to explain the variation of melting points with the content of calcium oxide. The radial distribution functions and species of oxygen bonding were employed to characterize the structural evolution with the different fraction of calcium oxide. The melting point of anorthite is lower than that of mullite due to less tricluster oxygen atoms. The content of CaO with high flux efficiency in (SiO 2 ) 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO is found from 5.00% to 15.00%. The current modelling work on melting behaviors of minerals containing various amount of CaO may provide new insight into the mechanism of ash fusion influenced by flux.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   MAX phase materials are one of the research hotspots for years due to their various potential applications. In this work, the structural, electronic and mechanical properties of the (Nb  x  Ti 1  \u2212   x  ) 2 SC and (Nb  x  Zr 1  \u2212   x  ) 2 SC (0\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0 x \u00a0\u2a7d\u00a01) solid solutions are investigated by first-principles density functional theory. The analyses of electronic band structures and density of states suggest good electric conductivities of the solid solutions, and the bands near the Fermi level are mainly contributed by Nb 4 d  and Ti 3 d  (Zr 4 d ) orbitals. Strong bonding interactions between M (M\u00a0=\u00a0Ti, Zr, Nb) and S or C atoms can be identified by the theoretical predictions, illuminating the phase stabilities of the solid solutions. The calculated mechanical properties including bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young\u2032s modulus, Poisson\u2032s ratio and Debye temperature of the solid solutions lead to the conclusion that Nb atom substitution of Ti 2 SC or Zr 2 SC enhances the mechanical strength. The highly correlation between surface energies and substitution contents of the solid solutions provides new insight into the structural stability of MAX phases against fracture and fabrication of substituted MXenes.",

Rectification behaviors are observed as important characteristics from some of these devices. Moderate n-type doping is found to be effective in enhancing rectification for Hf2C(OH)2\u2013Hf2CO2, and the currents at the intermediate positive bias show an excellent rectification ratio. Moreover, high n-type doping may generate a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect in the Hf2C(OH)2\u2013Hf2CO2...",

In addition, the effects of certain crystal faces on catalytic performance have been limitedly understood. Toward this end, the (1 0 0) plane oriented two-dimensional lamellar Mo2C transformed from carbon fibers is synthesized successfully in a molten salt system. Subsequently, the electrocatalytic properties toward HER show that (1 0 0) plane oriented Mo2C functions well in both acidic and basic media. The density functional theory calculations show that the most stable Mo/C termination of the (1 0 0) plane contains multiple catalytically active centers. These close-to-zero \u0394GH* values verify its better HER performance. Besides, the correlation between hydrogen adsorption behavior and the water dissociation process as well as their corresponding roles in the overall acid and alkaline HER rates have been discussed...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Zr 2 Al 3 C 4  coatings are potential candidates to prevent claddings of traditional Zr-based alloys from severe oxidation in water steam at high temperature. However, the diffusion of aluminum between coating and substrates at high temperature results in a coating composition deviating from the compositional domain for formation of the Zr 2 Al 3 C 4  phase. Thus, synthesis of Zr 2 Al 3 C 4  coatings on zirconium-alloy substrates is challenging. Here, we report that the Zr 2 Al 3 C 4  phase can be obtained on zirconium alloy (ZIRLO) substrates where an Al C/Si interlayer deposited by magnetron sputtering is introduced. The Al C/Si interlayer prevented elemental diffusion of aluminum between the Zr Al C coating and the substrates during a post-annealing process at 800\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh. The Al/Zr ratio of the Zr Al C coating after annealing was \u223c0.96 and \u223c0.59 in the cases of with and without Al C/Si interlayer, respectively. Hence, the Al C/Si interlayer acts as diffusion barrier and greatly decreases the deviation from the standard stoichiometric ratio of the Zr 2 Al 3 C 4  phase, which facilitates the formation of the Zr 2 Al 3 C 4  phase in the final coating.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A uniform TiC/Ti 2 AlC gradient coating was obtained on carbon fibers via an in-situ reaction in molten salts. The results indicated that in-situ growth of TiC/Ti 2 AlC coating caused strong interfacial bonding and surface defects. In this case, evident stress concentration was induced and cracks penetrated the fiber easily during tensile loading. Thus the tensile strength of carbon fibers was dramatically decreased to 78\u202f\u00b1\u202f13\u202fMPa. In order to improve the performance of the as-prepared TiC/Ti 2 AlC-coated carbon fibers, a pyrolytic carbon layer was pre-fabricated on carbon fibers. By introducing pyrolytic carbon layer, the interfacial bonding strength and surface defects were reduced accordingly. These improvements lead to a decrease of stress concentration and cracks propagation, and facilitate the interfacial debonding during tensile loading. As a result, the tensile strength of the fiber was significantly increased to 550\u202f\u00b1\u202f72\u202fMPa. This fact indicates that pre-fabricating a pyrolytic carbon layer on carbon fibers is an effective method to improve the reliability of the TiC/Ti 2 AlC-coated carbon fibers. The present work also provides a feasible way to fabricate TiC/Ti 2 AlC interphase for high-performance Cf/SiC composites.",

Thus, it is of importance to acquire the classical interatomic interaction potential in order to predict the mechanical behavior of FeCrAl structures at the microscopic scale. In this work, the particle swarm optimization method has been applied and improved to develop the interatomic potentials for Fe, Cr, Al unitary systems and Fe-Cr, Fe-Al binary systems. The potential parameters are fitted to experimental elastic constants, first principle calculated lattice information and defect formation energies with consideration of force matching. The developed Fe-Cr-Al ternary potentials are used to predict the phase stability region for FeCrAl ferrite alloys. The bulk modulus for the single crystal and the plastic behavior under grain boundary tensile stress are also modeled to find the influence of Cr and Al contents on the mechanical properties of FeCrAl alloys. The solutes Cr would improve the mechanical properties while high Al content would lead to poor elastic and plastic properties. The predictions from the newly developed potential are in good agreement with experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, first principles calculations are performed to investigate the structural, electronic, and mechanical properties of the interface between \u03b2-SiC ceramics and M  n +1 AlC  n   (M\u202f=\u202fSc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta;  n \u202f=\u202f1,2) phases, with particular focus on Ti 3 AlC 2  and Ti 2 AlC. The interface between the \u03b2-SiC(111) and Ti  n+1  AlC  n   (0001) ( n \u202f=\u202f1,2) surfaces is most likely a stable interface because of the small misfit in lattice constants. Six different interface models between \u03b2-SiC(111) and Ti  n +1 AlC  n  (0001) are examined. The optimized interfacial distances are determined using the universal binding energy relation method, and then each model is fully relaxed to calculate work of adhesion. By comparison, it is determined that the junctions connecting the C-terminated SiC(111) and Ti-terminated Ti  n +1 AlC  n  (0001) surfaces are the most stable structures. Then the electronic structures for this interface model of Ti 3 AlC 2 /SiC are analyzed from the density of states, atomic charges, total electron densities and electron density difference. The elastic moduli are also computed in this study, and the data show that the mechanical properties for the composite Ti  n +1 AlC  n  /SiC slab are between those of bulk Ti  n +1 AlC  n   and \u03b2-SiC, with enhanced plasticity. Finally, the results for \u03b2-SiC/Ti  n +1 AlC  n   are extended to study the interfacial stabilization of \u03b2-SiC ceramics and the wider class of M  n +1 AlC  n   phase coatings (M\u202f=\u202fSc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta;  n \u202f=\u202f1,2). It is found that SiC ceramics may be effectively joined by M  n+1  AlC  n   with stable interfacial chemical bonding, which provides a theoretical basis for the effective junction in SiC composites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Accident tolerant fuel claddings are extremely urgent to increase the safety margin of light water reactors. In this work, Cr-Al-Si ternary alloy coatings were proposed to increase high-temperature oxidation resistance of zirconium claddings. Cr 62.8 Al 27.9 Si 9.3  coatings were deposited on Zr coupons by magnetron sputtering, followed by evaluation of their oxidation resistance and adhesion strength under high-temperature steam. No oxidation of the Zr coupons underneath the coatings occurred in the 1000\u202f\u00b0C steam for 15\u202fmin. In the 1200\u202f\u00b0C steam for 30\u202fmin, both the weight gain and the thickness of the \u03b1-Zr(O) layer decreased 40% and 50%, related to those of the uncoated coupons, respectively. Moreover, the adhesion of coating and substrate was improved after the high-temperature oxidation, with the adhesion strength of the oxidized coating \u2013 Zr substrate more than ~50\u202fN. It was further observed that the Al and Si atoms preferentially diffused outwards the surface to form a layer of oxides, and the atoms diffused towards the Zr substrate to form a mixed interlayer. The outside barrier layer and the inter-diffused layer could contribute to the enhanced oxidation resistance and the adhension of the coated Zr coupons, which would be highly desirable for the zirconium claddings.",

The composition and microstructure of these films were characterized by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Polycrystalline V 2 AlC phase was obtained in the films with nearly stoichiometric composition. The microstructural evolution includes random nucleation at the film/substrate interface, competitive growth resulting in a (110) preferred orientation with increasing thickness. The mechanism for crystallization could be understood in terms of polymorphic crystallization. The results show that polycrystalline MAX-phase V 2 AlC could be directly synthesized on amorphous substrates.",

The quest for new 2D materials with unique structure and special properties has become urgent. Herein we report on the preparation of a new kind of ternary 2D material, Ti4AlN3 nanosheets, by liquid exfoliation of the corresponding laminated MAX phase. The obtained Ti4AlN3 nanosheets, bearing abundant surface groups, can be further used to fabricate micro-patterns via micro-contact printing (\u03bcCP) and subsequently functionalized through self-initiated photografting and photopolymerization (SIPGP) to achieve MAX-based hybrid patterned polymer brushes. Our work opens a door to explore the synthesis of 2D hybrid materials for functional applications based on the traditional MAX phases.",

        "abstract": "With the growing interest in low dimensional materials, MXenes have also attracted considerable attention recently. In this work, the thermal and electrical properties of oxygen-functionalized M2CO2 (M\u2009=\u2009Ti, Zr, Hf) MXenes are investigated using first-principles calculations. Hf2CO2 is determined to exhibit a thermal conductivity better than MoS2 and phosphorene. The room-temperature thermal conductivity along the armchair direction is determined to be 86.25~131.2 Wm\u22121\u2009K\u22121 with a flake length of 5~100\u2009\u03bcm. The room temperature thermal expansion coefficient of Hf2CO2 is 6.094\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126 K\u22121, which is lower than that of most metals. Moreover, Hf2CO2 is determined to be a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.657\u2009eV and to have high and anisotropic carrier mobility. At room temperature, the Hf2CO2 hole mobility in the armchair direction (in the zigzag direction) is determined to be as high as 13.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103\u2009cm2V\u22121s\u22121 (17.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009103\u2009cm2V\u22121s\u22121). Thus, broader utilization of Hf2CO2, such as the material for nanoelectronics, is likely. The corresponding thermal and electrical properties of Ti2CO2 and Zr2CO2 are also provided. Notably, Ti2CO2 presents relatively lower thermal conductivity but much higher carrier mobility than Hf2CO2. According to the present results, the design and application of MXene based devices are expected to be promising.",

A SiC/TSC/SiC joining sample with bend strength of 80.4\u00a0MPa was obtained at a low joining temperature of 1300\u00a0\u00b0C within a total time of 15\u00a0min. Three simple failure mechanism models were established, and the failure mechanisms of the joints joined at different temperatures were then revealed. The element diffusion and phase transition behaviour in the joining interface were investigated.",

        "abstract": "Ab initio calculations are performed to investigate the host-guest interactions and multiple occupancies of some sulfur- (HS, CS) and nitrogen-containing (N, NO, and NH) molecules in dodecahedral, tetrakaidecahedral, and hexakaidecahedral water cages in this work. Five functionals in the framework of density functional theory are compared, and the M06-2X method appears to be the best to predict the binding energies as well as the geometries. Results show that N and NO molecules are more stable in the 56 cage, while NH and HS prefer to stabilize in the 56 cage. This suggests that the sI hydrates of NH and HS exhibit higher stability than the sII structures and that sII NO hydrate is more stable than sI NO hydrate. N is found to be more stable in type II structure with single occupancy and to form type I hydrate with multiple occupancy, which is consistent with the experimental observations. As to the guest molecule CS, it may undergo severe structural deformation in the 5 and 56 cage. For multiple occupancies, the 5, 56, and 56 water cages can trap up to two N molecules, and the 56 water cage can accommodate two HS molecules. This work is expected to provide new insight into the formation mechanism of clathrate hydrates for atmospherically important molecules.",

        "abstract": "HfCO, a new MXene member synthesized recently, was predicted to be a semi-metal with high mechanical strength. Based on the unique electronic structure, the energy bands and electrical conductivities of the MXene under various strains are comprehensively investigated in this paper. Biaxial and two orthogonal uniaxial strains in both compressive and tensile manners are studied. Results from this study suggest that HfCO shows a transition between semi-metal and semi-conductor under both biaxial and uniaxial strains. A compressive strain generally induces a larger energy overlap between the conduction band minimum and the valance band maximum, while a tensile strain reduces the energy band overlap and even opens a band gap. As a consequence, the magnitude of electrical conductivity decreases drastically from compressive to tensile strains applied. Moreover, the uniaxial strains are determined to be efficient in manipulating the anisotropy of the electrical conductivity. These data imply that the HfCO MXene is a promising candidate material for devices such as strain sensors.",

        "abstract": "MXenes represent a new family of two-dimensional materials that have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Because of the remarkably different structures of Sc2C(OH)2 and Sc2CO2 MXene and their recently reported properties, this study explored the structural evolution and mechanism of chemical conversion between these two MXenes. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), the mechanism for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation is investigated by gradually removing/adding surface hydrogen atoms for Sc2C(OH)2/Sc2CO2 supercells. Employing three different supercells (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 and 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1), intermediate states Sc2C(OH)xO2-x with varying hydrogen content x (0.0625\u2264x \u2264 1.94) are obtained. The results show that the trend is to minimize the difference in the number of hydrogen atoms and the distance between them on the two sides of the monolayer. This feature is found to be generally applicable to other functional groups of MXenes during surface conversion. Analysis of these structures shows that all the oxygen, carbon and scandium atoms remain in essentially the same locations as in Sc2C(OH)2 until atoms rearrange in the carbon layer at sufficiently low x. Regarding the electronic properties, the behavior of the rearranged configurations is found to depend on the structure, moving beyond the conventional model of p-type doping induced by dehydrogenation. Bipolar magnetic semiconductors (BMSs) are identified from these rearranged configurations by the inhomogeneous distribution of hydrogen atoms on the different sides and x values approximately in the range of 0.188 \u2264 x \u2264 0.812. Findings from this study suggest that the intrinsic spin-polarized semiconducting characteristics of Sc2C(OH)xO2-x are expected to be experimentally observable if samples are prepared as nanoscale flakes. The current results indicate that Sc-based MXene may be a promising material for nanoscale spintronic devices.",

Herein, we demonstrate the first case of using two-dimensional (2D) multilayered V2CTx nanosheets prepared by HF etching of V2AlC to remove actinides from aqueous solutions. The V2CTx material is found to be a highly efficient uranium (U(VI)) sorbent, evidenced by a high uptake capacity of 174 mg g(-1), fast sorption kinetics, and desirable selectivity. Fitting of the sorption isotherm indicated that the sorption followed a heterogeneous adsorption model, most probably due to the presence of heterogeneous adsorption sites. Density functional theory calculations, in combination with X-ray absorption fine structure characterizations, suggest that the uranyl ions prefer to coordinate with hydroxyl groups bonded to the V-sites of the nanosheets via forming bidentate inner-sphere complexes.

The adsorption of CH4 and CO2+CH4 in the sI and sII hydrates are found to exhibit the one-site Langmuir-type adsorption behavior. The calculated occupancy ratio \u03b8L/\u03b8S and the separation factor of CO2 to CH4 vary with the temperature and pressure, and provide the prerequisite information about CH4 recovery yield at different experimental conditions for the CO2-CH4 gas exchange process. Accordingly, the phase equilibria of clathrate hydrates of pure gases and mixtures are predicted and the corresponding heat of dissociation and hydration number are determined. The current investigation provides new perspectives to understand the mechanism behind the gas adsorption behavior of clathrate hydrates.",

        "abstract": "Developing high surface area Mo2C with certain crystal plane exposed is an efficient strategy but urgent challenge to optimize the HER catalytic performances. In addition, the effects of certain crystal faces on catalytic performance have been limitedly understood. Toward this end, (1 0 0) plane oriented 2D lamellar Mo2C transformed from carbon fiber is synthesized successfully in a molten salt system. Subsequently, the electrocatalytic properties towards HER show that (1 0 0) plane oriented Mo2C functions well in both acidic and basic media. The density functional theory calculations show that the most stable Mo/C termination of (1 0 0) plane contains multiple catalytically active centers. These close-to-zero \u0394GH* values verify its better HER performance. Besides, the correlation between hydrogen adsorption behavior and the water dissociation process, as well as their corresponding roles in the overall acid and alkaline HER rate have been discussed in-depth. A simple mechanistic analysis is put forward to explain the favorable HER performance of lamellar structure \u03b2-Mo2C in alkaline other than acid electrolytes. The molten salt method may provide a new way for developing electrocatalysts with oriented crystal faces.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted intensive attention in nanoscience and nanotechnology due to their outstanding properties. Among these materials, the emerging family of 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides (referred to as MXenes) stands out because of the vast available chemical space for tuning materials chemistry and surface termination, offering opportunities for property tailoring. Specifically, semiconducting properties are needed to enable utilization in optoelectronics, but direct bandgaps are experimentally challenging to achieve in these 2D carbides. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of 2D hydroxyl-functionalized and carbon-deficient scandium carbide, namely ScCOH, by selective etching of a layered parent ScAlC compound. The 2D configuration is determined as a direct bandgap semiconductor, with an experimentally measured bandgap approximated to 2.5 eV. Furthermore, this ScCOH based device exhibits excellent photoresponse in the ultraviolet-visible light region (responsivity of 0.125 A/W @360 nm/10 V, and quantum efficiency of 43%). Thus, this 2D ScCOH direct-bandgap semiconductor may find applications in visible-light detectors, photocatalytic chemistry, and optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "MXenes, the new 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, have recently attracted extensive attention due to their diverse applications and excellent performances. However, the thermal and electrical properties of most MXene materials are yet to be studied. In this work, we investigate the electrical and thermal properties of semiconducting Sc2CT2 (T = F, OH) MXenes using first-principles calculations. Both of the Sc2CT2 (T = F, OH) MXenes are determined to show excellent carrier mobilities. The electron mobility in the Sc2CF2 MXene is found to be strongly anisotropic at room temperature, with values of 5.03 \u00d7 103 and 1.07 \u00d7 103 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 in the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. The predicted electron mobility in the zigzag direction of the Sc2CF2 is nearly four-fold that in the armchair direction of the promising semiconductor phosphorene. In contrast to Sc2CF2, Sc2C(OH)2 presents approximately isotropic electron mobility. The values at room temperature in the zigzag and armchair directions are calculated as 2.06 \u00d7 103 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and 2.19 \u00d7 103 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, respectively. In regard to the thermal properties, the thermal conductivities of the Sc2CT2 (T = F, OH) MXenes have been determined. The predicted values are higher than those of most metals and semiconducting low-dimensional materials, such as monolayer MoS2 and phosphorene. In particular, the room-temperature thermal conductivity along the Sc2CF2 armchair direction has been determined to be as high as 472 W m\u22121 K\u22121 based on a flake length of 5 \u03bcm, which is even higher than that of the best traditional conductor silver. The corresponding value in the zigzag direction of Sc2CF2 is calculated to be 178 W m\u22121 K\u22121. The thermal conductivity in Sc2C(OH)2 is less anisotropic and lower compared to that in Sc2CF2. The room-temperature value in the armchair (zigzag) direction is determined to be 173 W m\u22121 K\u22121 (107 W m\u22121 K\u22121). Based on their excellent electron mobilities and high thermal conductivities, both of the Sc2CT2 (T = F, OH) MXenes could be promising candidate materials for the next generation of electronic devices.",

The melting points are identified by the variation of the volume and mean square displacement, while viscosities are calculated by the Green\u2013Kubo formula. The melting point is determined to be higher for coal ash systems with higher S/A ratios. The analyses of the radial distribution function and oxygen contents are performed to illustrate the structural evolution during the melting process. The interactions of different types are analyzed to explain the trend of melting points for various S/A ratios. The main structural features during slag melting are found to be the conversion of the oxygen atoms from the tricluster type to the bridging type. The viscosities of the slag systems near melting points are determined to be correlated to the S/A ratio as well. The computational results from this work ma...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Carbon fiber reinforced carbon composites (C f /C) were first joined by combining electric field-assisted sintering technology and using a Ti 3 SiC 2  (TSC) tape film as interlayer. A joint with shear strength of 26.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0MPa was obtained within 12\u00a0min\u00a0at a joining temperature of 1200\u00a0\u00b0C. The joint morphology, interface reaction, shear fracture behavior, and joining mechanism were investigated in detail. To achieve reliable joining of a C f /C composite to itself via a TSC interlayer, the current work show the crucial controlling factor of interface reaction on the shear strength and the shear fracture behavior. Optimized bonding could be achieved without sacrificing the high strength of the carbon fibers and also taking advantage of the pseudo-plasticity feature of the TSC interlayer. A possible high-toughness joining structure was also proposed based on these results. The current-aid joining technique shortened significantly the bonding process of the C f /C composites at moderate temperatures, and simplifies the manufacture of components with complex shapes.",

We demonstrate that the energy gaps in patterned Ti2CO2 nanoribbons can be tuned by appropriate designs of crystallographic orientation and widths. The Ti2CO2 nanoribbons along the zigzag direction with width parameter larger than six show zero or very low band gaps, while band gaps are opened for Ti2CO2 nanoribbons with armchair-shaped edges. The electronic transport properties for the devices of Ti2CO2 nanoribbons with various widths are investigated using nonequilibrium Green\u2019s functions, and the current\u2013voltage characteristics of the devices are predicted. The current calculations reveal that some of these devices may have a nonlinear feature as well as negative differential resistance behaviors. The zigzag and armchair Ti2CO2 nanoribbon devices show different current\u2013voltage curves. There are onset biases for armchai...",

        "abstract": "Most fascinating applications of graphene-based devices are highly dependent on the precise fabrication of patterned graphene microstructures. While considerable progress of 2D patterning of graphene has been achieved with various lithographic techniques, the realization of patterned 3D graphene microstructures still remains a significant challenge. Here, a rapid and highly scalable roller-assisted microcontact printing (RA\u03bcCP) strategy for the fabrication of 3D graphene oxide micropatterns is reported. The facile RA\u03bcCP allows for the robust negative duplication of 3D topologies of the microstructured stamp using chemically modified graphene as the inks. The patterned 3D graphene microstructures exhibit interesting properties of graphene itself and allow for further functionalization of polymers to enable the potential integration of the 3D patterned microstructures into next-generation 2D Janus hybrid thin film for chemical sensors and other electronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Ti2CO2, as the representative MXene with semiconducting characteristics and ultrahigh carrier mobility, has attracted increasing attention in material science. Herein, various Ti2CO2 alloys with Ti displaced by neighboring elements Sc and V, or C by B and N are investigated in this paper based on the first-principles density functional calculations. The structures and mechanical and electronic properties are thoroughly studied for the configurations with varying alloying atom concentrations. The choices of alloying elements play a critical role in determining the lattice parameters and layer thickness. The Sc substitutions generally increase the lattice parameter but decrease the layer thickness. In contrast, the introduction of N presents slight influence on the structural parameters. The mechanical strength shows remarkable variations by introducing the alloying elements. The maximum elastic constant c 11 is determined to be 425 GPa in (Ti0.25V0.75)2CO2, and the corresponding minimum value is only 104 GPa found in (Ti0.125Sc0.875)2CO2. With respect to the electronic properties, although B and Sc both present one less valance electron compared to their replaced elements C and Ti, it is easier to realize the p-type semiconductor in the configurations containing Sc. Both the V and N substitutions are capable of generating n-type semiconductors, but their optimal stoichiometric compositions are quite different. Among all the configurations investigated, only (Ti0.5V0.5)2CO2 and (Ti0.375V0.625)2CO2 are magnetic, with their magnetism determined to be 2.61 uB/cell and 1.52 uB/cell, respectively. Thus, the method of alloying neighboring elements provides an effective approach in manipulating the physical properties of the Ti2CO2, which might widen the possible applications of MXene materials.",

The underlying mechanism of the Si-alloying-facilitated etching process is thoroughly studied by first-principles density functional calculations.

Compared with neat PVDF, the PVDF composites with varying content of MXene (0\u20135 wt%) showed an enhancement in the PVDF thermal conductivity. In particular, when a loading of 5 wt% was attained, the thermal conductivity was increased to 0.363 W mK\u22121, an approximate 1-fold enhancement compared with that of neat PVDF. In addition, MXene also exhibited a better performance in enhancing the thermal dynamic mechanical properties of PVDF. For instance, PVDF composites with only 5 wt% MXene exhibited a storage modulus as high as 7501 MPa, corresponding to a 64% enhancement compared with that of neat PVDF. In light of the excellent thermal properties of the PVDF/MXene composites, they can be expected to have a wide range of potential applications in thermal interfacial materials and structural components.",

        "abstract": "A novel family of Ti3C2Tx/ferrite composites with high reflection loss was developed using a facile in situ co-precipitation method. The as-synthesized Ti3C2Tx/ferrite composite with a 5 wt% Ti3C2Tx MXenes loading exhibited high reflection loss (\u221242.5 dB) at 13.5 GHz. The effective absorption bandwidth of the 5 wt% Ti3C2Tx/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 composite reached \u223c3 GHz (12\u201315 GHz) in the K-band. The incorporation of Ti3C2Tx MXenes improved the electromagnetic impedance of the Ti3C2Tx/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 composite resulting from the enhanced electrical conductivity. The potential electromagnetic wave absorption mechanisms were revealed, which may contain magnetic loss, dielectric loss, conductivity loss, multiple reflections, and scattering. The technique is facile, fast, scalable, and favorable for the commercialization of this composite. This study provides a potential way to develop EM wave absorbing materials for a large family of MXenes/ferrite composites.",

In the present investigations, the stabilities and formation energies of helium defects in the Zr/Ti 2 AlC interface are studied by first principles calculations. The calculations are performed using four possible interface models, and the trap of helium atoms in interstitial or vacancy sites are taken into consideration. According to the predicted formation energies, a single He atom tends to reside between the Al and Ti planes. The results also imply that Al vacancies are better able to trap He atoms. The stepwise rise for the trapping energies with the increasing number of trapped He atoms are determined in an Al vacancy and the corresponding swelling effect is examined. These investigations may provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms of helium bubble nucleation and formation in the Zr/Ti 2 AlC interface.",

The results indicated that sample microstrain increased gradually from 0.14 to 0.22% as dose increased from 0 to 30\u00a0dpa. Besides, the nanohardness of Ni\u201317Mo\u20137Cr alloy increased with irradiation dose until 10\u00a0dpa, and then, softening effect became dominant while further increasing dose to 30\u00a0dpa. After being irradiated at room temperature, the swelling rate of Ni\u201317Mo\u20137Cr alloy was found to be around 0.04% per dpa. These data are helpful in estimating the irradiation resistance of this newly developed Ni\u201317Mo\u20137Cr alloy in nuclear energy systems.",

The phase, microstructure and electromagnetic properties of CNT/Ni 0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 composites were investigated. After surface modification, The zeta potential value of CNTs could maintain at about -50 mV when pH is higher than 8, which affords a suitable surface environment for in situ coating of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanocrystallines. With increasing CNTs content, the saturation magnetization of the composites is gradually reduced, while the complex magnetic permeability changes little. The complex dielectric constant of the composites is significantly increased when the concentration of CNTs approaches the percolation threshold value of 2 wt%. When CNTs content is 5 wt%, the reflection ratios are less than -10 dB within the frequency range 2-9 GHz, and the reflection ratios reach a minimum -32.5 dB at a frequency of about 3.9 GHz. \u00a9 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Using the silver nanoparticles (NPs) prepared through the reduction of AgNO3 by beta-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD), the transformation of GSH to GSSG under DBD irradiation can be probed with only a small quantity of sample at low concentration. Based on the intensity ratio of two characteristic Raman bands, i.e., the band at 1051 cm\u22121 (C\u2013N stretching) and the band at 509 cm\u22121 (S\u2013S stretching), which stem respectively from GSH and GSSG, the conversion between the reduced and oxidized glutathione can be determined quantitatively. This work demonstrates another useful extension of the SERS technique applied to bioscience research, i.e., rapid probing and quantitative assessing of chemical reactions of biomolecules under oxidative stress conditions.",

The formation mechanism and properties have been also demonstrated. The structural, morphological, and magnetic properties of ZnFe2O4 hollow microspheres were investigated by means of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and physical properties measurements system. The surface area was determined using the BET method. XRD and IR analyses confirm the cubic spinel phase of ZnFe2O4 hollow microspheres. Every magnetic microsphere is made up of many ultrafine ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with porous structure. The as-prepared porous magnetic hollow spheres have higher surface area and excellent magnetic properties at room temperature.",

        "abstract": "The amendment of contaminated soil with organic materials is considered to be an environmentally friendly technique to immobilize heavy metal(loid)s and minimize their subsequent bioaccumulation in plants. This study focuses on the effects of different amendment techniques, such as the use of activated carbons (granulated or powder) and farmyard manure at various application rates (2 and 5\u00a0%). These techniques were applied on heavy metal(loid)s such as Ni, Cr, Cd, Pb, Mn, Cu, Zn, Fe, Co, and Al that were present in mine-impacted soil and caused bioaccumulation in cultivated plants. The results showed that, compared with the control, almost all the techniques significantly (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) reduced the bioavailability of heavy metal(loid)s in the amended soil. The bioaccumulation of heavy metal(loid)s in Penisitum americanum and Sorghum bicolor was significantly (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) reduced with all techniques, while Zn and Cd concentrations increased with the use of farmyard manure. Also compared with the control, plant growth was significantly decreased with the use of activated carbons, particularly with powder activated carbons, while farmyard manure (at 5\u00a0%) significantly (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) increased plant growth. Among the amendment techniques, powdered activated carbons (at 5\u00a0%) were best at reducing the bioavailability of heavy metal(loid)s in soil and plant accumulation. However, it negatively affected the growth of selected plant species.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) concentrations in the soil and plants (medicinal and fodder) grown in chromite mining-affected areas, Northern Pakistan. Soil and plant samples were collected and analyzed for Pb and Cd concentrations using atomic absorption spectrometer. Soil pollution load indices (PLIs) were greater than 2 for both Cd and Pb, indicating high level of contamination in the study area. Furthermore, Cd concentrations in the soil surrounding the mining sites exceeded the maximum allowable limit (MAL) (0.6\u00a0mg\u00a0kg), while the concentrations of Pb were lower than the MAL (350\u00a0mg\u00a0kg) set by State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) for agriculture soil. The concentrations of Cd and Pb were significantly higher (\u2009<\u20090.001) in the soil of the mining-contaminated sites as compared to the reference site, which can be attributed to the dispersion of toxic heavy metals, present in the bed rocks and waste of the mines. The concentrations of Pb and Cd in majority of medicinal and fodder plant species grown in surrounding areas of mines were higher than their MALs set by World Health Organization/Food Agriculture Organization (WHO/FAO) for herbal (10 and 0.3\u00a0mg\u00a0kg, respectively) and edible (0.3 and 0.2\u00a0mg\u00a0kg, respectively) plants. The high concentrations of Cd and Pb may cause contamination of the food chain and health risk.",

In theory, it is no need of direct skin contact to be detected and unaffected by changes in skin impedance. So, it is hopeful for developing wearable sensing device with clothes. However, there have been no studies so far to detect MMG signal on clothes and verify the feasibility of pattern recognition. For this study, 4-channel MMG signals were detected on clothes from the thigh muscles of 8 able-bodied participants. The support vector machines (SVM) classifier with 4 common features was used to recognize 6 knee motions and the average accuracy of nearly 88% was achieved. The accuracy can be further improved up to 91% by introducing a new proposed feature of the difference of mean absolute value (DMAV), but not by root mean square (RMS) or mean absolute value (MAV). Furthermore, the first-order Markov chain model was combined with the SVM classifier and it can avoid the misclassifications in some cases. For application to wearable power-assisted devices, this study would promote the developments of more flexible, more comfortable, and minimally obtrusive wearable sensing devices with clothes and recognition techniques of human motion intention.",

Biological methods for nano-selenium synthesis have attracted wide interests, because they can be operated at ambient temperature and pressure without complicated equipments. In this work, a protozoa, Tetrahymena thermophila (T. thermophila) SB210, was used to in vivo synthesize nano-selenium. The biosynthesized nano-selenium was characterized using transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The synthesized amorphous spherical selenium nanoparticles had diameters of 50-500nm with the coexistence of irregular nano-selenium. The expressions of glutathione (GSH) synthesis related gene glutathione synthase, cysteine-rich protein metallothionein related gene metallothionein-1 and [2Fe-2S] cluster-binding protein related gene were up-regulated in the nano-selenium producing group. Also, the subsequent GSH detection and in vitro synthesis experimental results suggest the three proteins were likely to be involved in the nano-selenium synthesis process.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2 MXene has attracted great attention in electrochemical energy storage devices (supercapacitors, lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries) due to its excellent electrical conductivity as well as high volumetric capacity. Nevertheless, existing study showed that multivalent Mg2+ ions cannot reversibly insert into MXene, resulting in a negligible capacity. Here we demonstrate a simple strategy to achieve high magnesium storage capability for Ti3C2 MXene by pre-intercalating a cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Density functional theory simulations verify that intercalated CTA+ cations reduce the diffusion barrier of Mg2+ on MXene surface, resulting in the significant improvement of the reversible insertion/desertion of Mg2+ ions between MXene layers. Consequently, the MXene electrode exhibits a desirable volumetric-specific capacity of 300 mAh cm-3 at 50 mA g-1 as well as outstanding rate performance. This work endows MXene material with an application in electrochemical energy storage, and simultaneously, magnesium battery materials ushered in a member.",

        "abstract": "The commonly used classifiers for pattern recognition of human motion, like backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM), usually implement the classification by extracting some hand-crafted features from the human biological signals. These features generally require the domain knowledge for researchers to be designed and take a long time to be tested and selected for high classification performance. In contrast, convolutional neural network (CNN), which has been widely applied to computer vision, can learn to automatically extract features from the training data by means of convolution and subsampling, but CNN training usually requires large sample data and has the overfitting problem. On the other hand, SVM has good generalization ability and can solve the small sample problem. Therefore, we proposed a CNN-SVM combined model to make use of their advantages. In this paper, we detected 4-channel mechanomyography (MMG) signals from the thigh muscles and fed them in the form of time series signals to the CNN-SVM combined model for the pattern recognition of knee motion. Compared with the common classifier performing the classification with hand-crafted features, the CNN-SVM combined model could automatically extract features using CNN, and better improved the generalization ability of CNN and the classification accuracy by means of combining the SVM. This study would provide reference for human motion recognition using other time series signals and further expand the application fields of CNN.",

Different from traditional thermal crosslinking, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation crosslinking was taken. The molecular weight, the consumption of  Si H group and ceramic yield of LHBPCS showed an increase trend with increasing the UV irradiation time. After 30\u00a0min of UV irradiation, 71.8\u00a0wt% ceramic yield was obtained. In addition, extra divinyldimethylsilane was added into LHBPCS. Under UV irradiation, both the  Si H group and vinyl group of divinyldimethylsilane were consumed. But the reaction extend of vinyl group was much faster than that of  Si H group. Compared with pure LHBPCS, the mixture of LHBPCS and 5\u00a0wt% divinyldimethylsilane gave a higher ceramic yield of 79\u00a0wt% after 30\u00a0min of UV irradiation. By heating the crosslinked LHBPCS to 1000\u00a0\u00b0C, a near stoichiometric SiC ceramic was got. It exhibited excellent thermal stability at 1400\u00a0\u00b0C in air.",

According to Fourier transform infrared result, the \u2013Si\u2013H, \u2013Si\u2013H2 and allyl groups were consumed. Possible cross-linking reactions (hydrosilylation, allyl group polymerisation and dehydrocoupling) were discussed. The ceramic yield of LHBPCS showed an increase trend with increasing the UV irradiation time. After 1\u2005h of UV irradiation for LHBPCS-1 (the molar ratio of chloropropene to chloromethyltrichlorosilane was 1:9), 78.0\u2005wt-% ceramic yield was obtained. In addition, LHBPCS with higher allyl group content had fewer pores in it. By heating LHBPCS-1 cross-linked by UV irradiation to 1400\u00b0C, a non-porous SiC ...",

The results showed with CNTs introduced at PyC-PyC interface, tensile strength and work of fracture (WOF) of a Cf/PyC/SiC composite had the largest increase, and significantly improved 54.9% and 130.3% respectively from those of the CNTs-free composite. Multiple interfaces (CF-PyC interface, CNT-PyC interface, PyC-PyC interface) failure and a great number of carbon fiber and carbon nanotube pull-outs were observed from tensile fracture morphology of the composite, which indicated weakening of PyC-PyC interface due to CNTs and accounted for the remarkable improvement in WOF of the composite. The increase of tensile strength of the composite was resulted from the reduction of residual stress of the composite.",

        "abstract": "A novel multiscale hydrothermal carbon layer (MHTCL) for carbon fiber (CF) surface modification was developed. The MHTCL is a multiscale high-disorder amorphous carbon coating with a colored appearance, abundant functional groups, multiscale roughness, a large specific surface area, a high surface energy, and good wetting ability. The O/C atom ratios of the MHTCL-modified CF were in the range of 0.17\u20130.23, and the functional groups were mainly C\u2013O and CO groups. During the low-concentration glucose hydrothermal treatment with the carbon fibers (CFs), the glucose generates furan derivative intermediates, which adsorb on the surface of the CFs and carbonize continuously, finally forming the MHTCL on the CFs. The fracture and rupture of the MHTCL during the forming process produce new nucleation centers on the CF surface, which result in abundant multiscale irregular particles. The MHTCL is a facile method for the modification of CFs. The fabrication of the CF composites demonstrated that the MHTCL obviously increases the interlaminar shear strength of the CF/polyimide composite and the interfacial interaction of the CF and polyetheretherketone.",

Phase diagram calculations on Si-Y-C ternary phase at different temperatures well illustrated that the Y 3 Si 2 C 2  phase can be stable with SiC but will be in liquid state at 1560\u2009\u00b0C. The liquid Y 3 Si 2 C 2  explained the enhanced consolidation of SiC ceramics and its disappearance after spark plasma sintering. Such Y 3 Si 2 C 2  coating could not only effectively improve the sintering, but also their mechanical and thermal properties of resultant ceramics. Typically, at 1700\u2009\u00b0C, the bulk SiC ceramic presented a mean grain size of 2.5\u2009um and relative density of 99.5% when the molar ratio of Y to SiC is 1:4 in molten salts; the Young\u2019s modulus, indentation hardness and fracture toughness measured by indentation test were 451.7\u2009GPa, 26.3\u2009GPa and 7.9\u2009M\u2009Pam 1/2 , respectively; the thermal conductivity is about 145.9\u2009W/(m\u2009K). Excellent thermal and mechanical properties could be associated with the fine grain size, optimized phase composition and improved grain boundary structure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A robust solid state diffusion joining technique for SiC ceramics was designed with a thickness-controlled Ti interlayer formed by physical vapor deposition and joined by electric field-assisted sintering technology. The interface reaction and phase revolution process were investigated in terms of the equilibrium phase diagram and the concentration-dependent potential diagram of the Ti-Si-C ternary system. Interestingly, under the same joining conditions (fixed temperature and annealing duration), the thickness of the Ti interlayer determined the concentration and distribution of the Si and C reactants in the resulting joint layer, and the respective diffusion distance of Si and C into the Ti interlayer differentiated dramatically during the short joining process (only 5\u00a0min). In the case of a 100\u00a0nm Ti coating as an interlayer, the C concentration in the joint layer was saturated quickly, which benefited the formation of a TiC phase and subsequent Ti 3 SiC 2  phase. The SiC ceramics were successfully joined at a low temperature of 1000\u00a0\u00b0C with a flexural strength of 168.2\u00a0MPa, which satisfies applications in corrosive environments. When the Ti thickness was increased to 1\u00a0\u03bcm, Si atoms diffused easily through the diluted Ti-C alloy (a dense TiC phase was not formed), and the Ti 5 Si 3  brittle phase formed preferentially. These findings highlight the importance of the diffusion kinetics of the reactants on the final composition in the solid state reaction, particularly in the joining technique for covalent SiC ceramics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The in situ generated ternary compound Al 3 BC shows good dispersion on the surfaces of B 4 C particles (10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0\u03bcm), obtained using the molten-salt method rather than the ball-milling method, which can form a conductive network in the pulse electric current sintering process to improve the sinterability of B 4 C. The sintering behaviour, microstructure and mechanical properties of compacts were investigated at different sintering temperatures and Al 3 BC contents. The study found that the relative density, elastic modulus, Vickers hardness, and fracture toughness of samples reached as high as 100%, 495\u00a0GPa, 37.0\u00a0GPa, and 6.32\u00a0MPa\u00a0m 1/2  at 1700\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, when the content of Al 3 BC was 18\u00a0wt.%. The crack propagation mode can provide an explanation for the higher toughness than that of pure B 4 C (3.19 MPa\u00a0m 0.5 ). Additionally, the good dispersion of Al 3 BC in B 4 C was found to change the fracture mode from the single transgranular mode to a mixture of intergranular and transgranular modes. The compositions of the compacts were almost pure B 4 C.",

        "abstract": "By means of first principles calculations, Zr-Al-C nanolaminates have been studied in the aspects of chemical bonding, elastic properties, mechanical properties, electronic structures, and vacancy stabilities. Although the investigated Zr-Al-C nanolaminates show crystallographic similarities, their predicated properties are very different. For (ZrC)nAl3C2 (n = 2, 3, 4), the Zr-C bond adjacent to the Al-C slab with the C atom intercalated in the Zr layers is the strongest, but the one with the C atom intercalated between the Zr layer and Al layer is the weakest. In contrast, the situation for (ZrC)nAl4C3 (n = 2, 3) is just the opposite. For Zr-Al-C nanolaminates, the calculated bulk, shear and Youngu0027s modulus increase in the sequence of Zr2AlC u003c Zr3AlC2 u003c Zr2Al4C5 u003c Zr3Al4C6 u003c Zr2Al3C4 u003c Zr3Al3C5 u003c Zr4Al3C6. The (ZrC)nAl3C2 (n = 2, 3, 4) series exhibit the most outstanding elastic properties. In the presence of the external pressure, the bulk and shear moduli exhibit a linear response to the pressure, except for Zr2AlC and Zr3AlC2, both of which belong to the so-called MAX phases. The two materials also exhibit very distinct properties in the strain-stress relationship, electronic structures and vacancy stabilities. As the intercalated Al layers increase, the formation energy of VZr and VAl increases, while the formation energy of VC decreases.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Based on analysis of the intermediate products of corrosion, a corrosion mechanism for ZrB2 is suggested. The morphology evolution of anodic ZrB2 is investigated. The density of the hexagonal-pyramid grain array is dictated by current density, and the time dictates the length of the hexagonal pyramid grains. The microstructure of the surface can be controlled by the current density, which demonstrates that the surface wettability of ZrB2 can be modified by tailoring the current density.",

The effect of initial pH and hydroxyl radical scavenger (ethanol) on the reduction efficiency was examined. High reduction efficiency was obtained when initial pH \u2264 2.0 or \u2265 8.0. In particular, addition of ethanol into the solution substantially increased the reduction efficiency and facilitated chromium removal from the solution in the form of sediment after discharge. The optimum pH values for Cr(VI) removal were within 6.0-7.0. Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed that the main constituent of the sediment is chromium hydroxide.",

The silica-Au/core-shell colloids were synthesized and immobilized on a quartz substrate, and a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotide designed as an aptamer for coralyne, namely, 5\u2032-SH-(CH2) 6-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-3\u2032, was covalently attached onto the Au nanoshells. The aptamer, with one end on the Au surface, changed conformation upon conjugation with target coralyne, which correspondingly caused changes in the intensity of the Raman band at 1376 cm-1 and the ratio of the Raman intensity at 736 cm-1 to the Raman intensity at 1319 cm -1. The intensity ratio increased with the amount of coralyne added, which therefore allowed the measurement coralyne in a selective and quantitative way, reaching a detection limit as low as 0.1 \u03bcM. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

It is a long-standing task to investigate the interaction between energetic particles and DNA together with its components such as nucleotides, nucleosides and bases so as to predict and assess the potential biological effects. In this study, argon gas discharge was employed to produce energetic ions and electrons. The gas discharge caused the radiolysis of aqueous bases and the involved reactions were analyzed by means of spectroscopic tools including UV-vis absorption, fluorescence and Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, also assisted by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). It was found that the discharge resulted in the adenine-derived lesions such as 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine, 8-OH-Ade and 2-OH-Ade in the radiolysis of aqueous adenine, as well as the thymine-derived lesions such as thymine glycol, 5-hydroxy-6-hydrothymine and/or 6-hydroxy-5-hydrothymine, 5-hydroxymethyluracil and 5-formyluracil in the radiolysis of aqueous thymine. The study of radio-sensitivity showed that adenine was more resistant to the discharge. The mechanisms of the involved reactions were studied in detail, confirming that the hydroxyl radical played a dominant role. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is one of the most commonly found microcystins (MCs) in fresh water and it poses danger to human health due to its potential hepatotoxicity. In the present study, we employed a novel method by using discharge plasma taking place at the gas-solution interface in gas atmosphere to degrade MC-LR in aqueous solution. The initial degradation rate of MC-LR was fastest under acidic conditions (5.41 \u00b1 0.17 \u00d7 10(-3) mM min(-1) at pH 3.04) and decreased to 2.22 \u00b1 0.11 \u00d7 10(-3) mM min(-1) and 0.912 \u00b1 0.02 \u00d7 10(-3) mM min(-1) at pH 4.99 and 7.02, respectively. The effects of total soluble nitrogen (TN), total soluble phosphorus (TP) and natural organic matter (NOM) on the degradation efficiency were studied. The degradation rate was remarkably affected by TP and TN. Mass spectrometry was applied to identify the products of the reactions. Major degradation pathways are proposed according to the results of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) results. It suggests that the degradation of MC-LR is initiated via the attack of hydroxyl radicals on the conjugated carbon double bonds of Adda and on the benzene ring of Adda. Finally, the toxicity of intermediates or end-products from MC-LR degraded by this method was assessed using Caenorhabditis elegans. Our findings demonstrates that discharge plasma oxidation is a promising technology for degradation and removal of MC-LR and it may lead us to a new route to efficient treatment of other cyanotoxins from aqueous solutions.",

SS304 induces high MN ratios of the two cell lines and thus has poor biocompatibility. The MN ratio of CHO cells is higher than background by about 63.9% and the MN ratio of XRS5 cells is even higher by about 100%, suggesting that most of the cellular DNA damages on the SS304 are DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and are efficiently repaired by the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. The surface biocompatibility of SS 304 may be enhanced by nitrogen plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). The altered oxidized species on the nitrogen plasma-implanted surface block cellular DSB repaired by the NHEJ pathway and decrease the MN ratio of XRS5 cells. Our results suggest that cellular DNA damages on the SS304, Cr and N implantation SS304 are mainly repaired by NHEJ pathway way. While cellular DNA damages can be blocked by SS304 implanted NH3 and N. Our results also suggest that the genotoxicity of cell assay such as MNT and DSB is a valid method to investigate biocompatibility.",

The damage of cysteine in aqueous solution under discharge was assessed via the acid ninhydrin reagent and the yield of cystine produced from the reaction was analyzed by FTIR. In addition, the generation of hydrogen sulfide was also identified. The destruction of solid cysteine under low-energy ion beam irradiation was estimated via monitoring IR bands of different functional groups (-SH, -NH 3, -COO -) of cysteine, and the production of cystine from ion-irradiated solid cysteine after dissolution in water was also verified. These results may help us to understand the inactivation of sulphydryl enzymes under direct and indirect interaction with the low-energy ion irradiation. \u00a9 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Energetic ions induce important biological effects and the research into radiolysis of amino acids can help to clarify radiolysis of proteins. For this purpose, arc-discharge induced radiolysis of the benzyl-containing aromatic amino acid phenylalanine in aqueous solution was studied and the damage was assessed quantitatively. The energetic ions were produced by arc-discharge in nitrogen and argon atmosphere. The arc-discharge induced chemical reactions of the biomolecule in aqueous solution were detected and analyzed by means of UV\u2013Vis absorption, fluorescence, Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Based on the multiple spectroscopic approach, the damage can be evaluated in a more reliable and convenient way. The fluorescence analysis in this case appears to be a more direct indicator for the assessment of damage, where it reveals that the damage increases with the irradiation time exponentially. On the contrary, the \u2018plateau region\u2019 or \u2018saddle-shape\u2019 apparently shown both in our rough absorption analysis and ninhydrin reaction test, similar to the previously reported feature of the dose effect for low-energy-ion induced damage, may be just a consequence with varied reactions and processes involved at different stages. This work thus demonstrated that application of appropriate combination of spectroscopic tools can effectively dissect the diversity of the radiolysis reaction system and assess the biomolecular damage properly.",

Evidence from spectroscopic approaches showed that enzymatic activity together with the contents of heme and iron in HRP decreased dramatically and concomitantly upon plasma treatment. The plasma induced both long- and short-lived reactive species which inactivated HRP in the solution. In particular, hydrogen peroxide broke the heme prosthetic group into fluorescent products, mainly dipyrrols and their derivatives, while other factors such as hydroxyl radicals and UV radiation generated during plasma discharge accelerated this heme protein degradation process. Inactivation of horseradish peroxidase induced by discharge plasma at the gas-solution interface is detected and its mechanism is analyzed based on quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity of the heme degradation product.

        "abstract": "Energetic particles exist ubiquitously and cause varied biological effects such as DNA strand breaks, lipid peroxidation, protein modification, cell apoptosis or death. An emerging biotechnology based on ion-beam technique has been developed to serve as an effective tool for mutation breeding of crops and microbes. In order to improve the effectiveness of ion-beam biotechnology for mutation breeding, it is indispensible to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of the interactions between the energetic ions and biological systems which is still elusive. A new trend is to conduct more comprehensive research which is based on micro-scaled observation of the changes of the cellular structures and compositions under the interactions. For this purpose, advanced synchrotron FTIR (s-FTIR) microscopy was employed to monitor the cellular changes of single fungal hyphae under irradiation of \u03b1-particles from 241Am. Intracellular contents of ROS, MDA, GSSG/GSH and activities of CAT and SOD were measured via biochemical assay. Ion-irradiation on Rhizopus oryzae causes localized vacuolation, autolysis of cell wall and membrane, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and conformational changes of proteins, which have been clearly revealed by the s-FTIR microspectroscopy. The different changes of cell viability, SOD and CAT activities can be explained by the ROS-involved chemical reactions. Evidently, the elevated level of ROS in hyphal cells upon irradiation plays the key role in the caused biological effect. This study demonstrates that s-FTIR microspectroscopy is an effective tool to study the damage of fungal hyphae caused by ionizing radiation and it facilitates the exploit of the mechanism for the interactions between the energetic ions and biological systems. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "A bacterial strain named CH-22 showing phytoplankton-lytic activity against bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa was isolated from Lake Chaohu of Anhui Province, China. The isolated strain was identified as Pseudomonas putida by morphology and homology research based on 16S rDNA. The phytoplankton-lytic activity was confirmed by reduction in cell number and chlorophyll a concentration of M. aeruginosa in an infected culture for a defined period. The initial bacterial and M. aeruginosa densities affected the phytoplankton-lytic activity significantly. When the 15% (150 \u03bcL/mL) concentration of bacterial cultures was infected, the highest phytoplankton-lytic activity reached to 98.8% after 7 days. When the initial M. aeruginosa density was less than 3\u00d710 6 cells/mL, about 90.0% of chlorophyll a was removed. Obvious reduction in phycocyanin concentration in the treated M. aeruginosa suggests that isolated strain may possibly inhibit the synthesis of photosynthetic apparatus. Supernatants of bacterial cultures showed higher phytoplankton-lytic activity, suggesting that phytoplankton-lytic bacterium P. putida indirectly attacked M. aeruginosa cells by secretion of extracellular antialgal substances, which is characterized as anti-heat shock. The isolated P. putida also showed effective phytoplankton-lytic activity against a wide range of phytoplankton. These results suggest that indigenous bacteria isolated from eutrophic lake may be employed to regulate the ecological balance between the phytoplankton and bacteria, and consequently, to reduce the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwaters.

One effective way in the investigation is to utilize Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy because it can offer sensitive and non-invasive measurements. In this paper a novel protocol was employed to prepare biomolecular samples in the form of thin and transversely uniform solid films that were suitable for both infrared and low-energy ion beam irradiation experiments. Under the irradiation of N + and Ar + ion beams of 25 keV with fluence ranging from 5\u00d710 15 ions/cm 2 to 2.5\u00d710 ions/cm 2, the ion radio-sensitivity of four amino acids, namely, glycine, tyrosine, methionine and phenylalanine, were evaluated and compared. The ion beam irradiation caused biomolecular decomposition accompanied by molecular desorption of volatile species and the damage was dependent on ion type, fluence, energy and types of amino acids. The effectiveness of application of FTIR spectroscopy to the quantitative assessment of biomolecular damage dose effect induced by low-energy ion radiation was thus demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "We proposed a method to inactivate M. aeruginosa by using discharge plasma taking at the gas-solution interface supplied by DC power. Multiple analysis techniques including fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to reveal the inactivation mechanism of M. aeruginosa. The photosynthetic pigment contents including phycocyanin, chlorophyll and metabolites were examined quantitatively. The DC glow discharge plasma caused an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the damage of M. aeruginosa cells are mainly attributed to the oxidative stress including OH attack and H2O2 oxidation. Our findings demonstrate that plasma oxidation is a promising technology for inactivation of M. aeruginosa cells with simultaneous removal of microcystins and so it may lead us to a new route to efficient treatment of cyanobacterial blooms.",

        "abstract": "A novel approach to prepare activated carbon from blue-green algal bloom residue has been tried for first time and its adsorption capability to remove hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) from aqueous solution has been examined. For this algal bloom residue derived activated carbon, the physical characters regarding adsorption capability were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Batch studies showed that initial pH, absorbent dosage, and initial concentration of Cr(VI) were important parameters for Cr(VI) absorption. It was found that initial pH of 1.0 was most favorable for Cr(VI) removal. The adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order equation and Freundlich isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity for Cr(VI) was 155.52 mg g(-1) in an acidic medium, which is comparable to best result from activated carbons derived from biomass. Therefore, this work put forward a nearly perfect solution which on one hand gets rid of environment-unfriendly algae residue while on the other hand produces high-quality activated carbon that is in return advantageous to environment protection.",

However, the previous synthetic approaches exhibited limited control over the morphology, size and materials of the nanocontainers, which are crucial in practical applications. Here, we present a synthetic approach to multi-segment linear-shaped nanopores with pre-designed morphologies inside anodic aluminium oxide (AAO), by tailoring the anodizing duration after a rational increase of the applied anodizing voltage and the number of voltage increase during Al foil anodization. Then, we achieve nanocontainers with designed morphologies, such as nanofunnels, nanobottles, nano-separating-funnels and nanodroppers, with tunable sizes and diverse materials of carbon, silicon, germanium, hafnium oxide, silica and nickel/carbon magnetic composite, by depositing a thin layer of materials on the inner walls of the pre-designed AAO nanopores. The strategy has far-reaching implications in the designing and large-scale fabrication of nanocontainers, opening up new opportunities in nanotechnology applications.",

A new ZnO-CuPc composite is formed on the porous-ZnO surface due to the interaction between the surface ZnO and CuPc, with its valence band (VB) energy level being higher than that of the pristine porous-ZnO. So that the efficiency of the photogenerated-electron transfer from the composite VB to the adjacent ZnO's surface states is drastically increased due to the reduced energy gap between the transition states. As a result, the sensitivity of the PCB-orientated SPV sensor is much improved by showing amplified variation of the SPV-signals perturbed by PCBs adsorbed on the ZnO-CuPc@porous-ZnO sensitive material.",

        "abstract": "A recyclable fluorescence sensor for Hg2+ and Zn2+, based on rhodamine 6G (R6G) and 8-aminoquinoline (8-AQ) co-modified core/shell Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles (denoted as R6G/8- AQ co-functionalized Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs), was developed. R6G derivative and 8-AQ derivative were conjugated onto the water- soluble core/shell Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) by covalent interaction. The R6G/8-AQ co-functionalized core/shell Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs showed fluorescence emission bands at 548 and 480 nm. When the R6G/8-AQ co-functionalized core/shell Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs were coordinated with Hg2+ and Zn2+, emission intensity at 548 nm increased with [Hg2+], while that at 480 nm increased with [Zn2+]. Moreover, there existed approximate linear relationships between fluorescence intensities and concentration of metal ions, in the range of 4.0\u00d710-9\u20137.65\u00d710-8 M for Hg2+ and 3.3\u00d710-9\u20133.96\u00d710-8 M for Zn2+, respectively. The lower detection limits for Hg2+ and Zn2+ were 1.0\u00d710-9 and 3.0\u00d710-9 M, respectively. The R6G/8-AQ co-functionalized core/shell Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs showed good selectivity to Hg2+ and Zn2+ over other common metal ions examined in neutral aqueous solutions. Moreover, the R6G/8-AQ co-functionalized core/shell Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs could be recycled from the detected samples using a magnet. This work has thus showed not only a practical sensing method for Zn2+ and Hg2+, but also a promising guide to the design of fluorimetric/colorimetric sensors for other targets.",

Additionally, these hierarchical nanostructure arrays possess high surface area with rich surface chemistry, being beneficial to capturing the analyte. The Ag-nanoplateassembled nanotube arrays can be used as sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates with good signal uniformity and reproducibility. Using such Ag hierarchical nanostructure arrays as SERS-substrates, not only has 10\u221214 M rhodamine 6G been identified, but also 10\u22127 M polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, a notorious class of persistent organic pollutants) are recognized, and even two congeners of PCBs can be identified in a mixture, showing the potential applications of the materials in SERS-based rapid detection of environmental organic pollutants.",

        "abstract": "A potential ultra-sensitive detection approach for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), based on the measurement of the intrinsic fluorescence of well-separated HCB molecules in ethanol, has been proposed. Owing to the strong intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction of the planar aromatic rings, self-aggregated HCB shows almost no fluorescence. However, the intrinsic emission of HCB can readily be detected in ethanol due to the enhanced emission from the disaggregated HCB, which is related to the hydrogen bond formation between ethanol and HCB. By simply measuring the HCB intrinsic fluorescence, a HCB concentration a little bit higher than 10(-14) M (~0.001 ppt) in ethanol can be detected; moreover, the fluorescence intensity of the HCB increases linearly with the HCB concentration ranging from 10(-10) to 10(-7) M. The approach might provide a simple, fast and efficient method for HCB quantification.",

        "abstract": "For surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors, one of the important issues is the development of substrates not only with high SERS-activity but also with strong ability to capture analytes. However, it is difficult to achieve the two goals simultaneously especially when detecting small molecules. Herein a compact battery-controlled nanostructure-assembled SERS system has been demonstrated for capture and detection of trace small molecule pollutants in water. In this SERS fluidic system, an electrical heating constantan wire covered with the vertically aligned ZnO nanotapers decorated with Ag-nanoparticles is inserted into a glass capillary. A mixture of thermo-responsive microgels, Au-nanorods colloids and analyte solution is then filled into the remnant space of the capillary. When the system is heated by switching on the battery, the thermo-responsive microgels shrink, which immobilizes the analyte and drives the Au-nanorod close to each other and close to the Ag-ZnO nanotapers. This process has also created high-density \u201chot spots\u201d due to multi-type plasmonic couplings in three-dimensional space, amplifying the SERS signal. This integrated device has been successfully used to measure methyl parathion in lake water, showing a great potential in detection of aquatic pollutants. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has a wide range of applications in surface1, 2, biological3, 4 and analytical5 sciences especially for rapid analysis of trace (bio-) chemicals6 due to its high sensitivity, fast response and fingerprint characteristics of SERS signals. It is generally accepted that noble metal nanostructures are able to amplify the SERS signals by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-induced electromagnetic field enhancement, while semiconducting nanostructures exhibit chemical enhancement effect ascribed to the charge transfer between the semiconductor and the analyte molecules7, 8, 9, 10. When a compact SERS device is used for real-time detection of trace toxic pollutants in the environment, the key to success of SERS analysis is to construct a substrate that has not only high SERS activity but also strong capability of capturing the analyte11, 12. However, it is difficult to achieve the two goals simultaneously especially when detecting small molecules. When detecting macromolecules such as proteins, the antibody immobilized on the SERS substrate is employed to capture the antigen (analyte)13. Unfortunately, limited antibody and other molecular recognition probes are available for capturing small molecules. To enable the detection of small molecules in the environmental samples, sealed apparatuses have been reported to prevent from volatilization, in which the plasmonic Ag/Au nanoparticles (NPs) and the analytes were blended and confined/enclosed in a microfluidic system14, 15, 16; and the analyte solution was injected into the microfluidic channel decorated with SERS active Ag-covered nanopillar arrays17. However, the plasmonic Ag/Au NPs or the Ag-covered nanopillars can only capture the nearby analytes for SERS measurement via chemi/physi-sorption, which limits the sensitivity of the SERS device. In order to capture more analyte effectively, thermo-responsive microgels were introduced into the SERS system. For example, poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) microgels were mixed with the plasmonic Au-NPs to form the Au-NPs@pNIPAM core@shell colloids. When the system was heated to a given temperature, the thermo-responsive pNIPAM shells were collapsed, leading to mechanically trapping of the analytes in the proximity to the plasmonic Au-NPs core for the enhanced SERS signal18. Recently the plasmonic nanogaps achieved by electrostatic forces have attracted many attentions19. In addition, the pNIPAM was also used as a thermo-responsive part in a nanogap tunable SERS substrate to trap the analyte to enhance the SERS signal20, 21. However, it remains a challenge to develop an integrated SERS device for detection of small molecules in the environment. The present work for the first time presents an integrated compact device that is able to online capture and to detect small molecules in an aqueous solution. Figure 1a shows the compact battery-controlled hierarchical hetero-nanostructure-assembled fluidic SERS system. The device was built by the following procedure (Fig. S1). First, a radial ZnO-nanotaper (ZnO-NT) array was electrodeposited on an electric heating constantan-wire (denoted as ZnO-NTs@constantan-wire), then the high-density Ag-NPs were decorated onto each ZnO-NT (denoted as Ag-NPs@ZnO-NTs@constantan-wire). Next, the Ag-NPs@ZnO-NTs@constantan-wire was inserted into a glass capillary. Finally, the analyte solution, Au nanorods (Au-NRs) and the thermo-responsive pNIPAM microgels were mixed and injected into the capillary to fill the empty space. This integrated system has demonstrated much stronger SERS enhancement than the free-standing Au-NRs in the solution, or the Ag-NPs decorated on the ZnO-NT, or the Au-NRs coupled to the Ag-NPs grown on the ZnO-NT. This strongly suggests that the thermo-sensitive microgel plays a significant role in amplifying the SERS signal. In fact, when the batter-controlled circuit is switched on to heat the system to above 32\u2009\u00b0C, the thermo-responsive pNIPAM microgels will shrink, leading to not only mechanical trapping of the analyte molecules much closer to the plasmonic Au-NRs and the Ag-NPs decorated on the ZnO-NTs but also abridging the spacing of the neighboring Au-NRs in the microgels, and that of the Au-NRs and their nearby Ag-NPs decorated on the ZnO-NTs, leading to the formation of high-density \u201chot spots\u201d in the three-dimensional (3D) space. The naked glass capillary (with I.D. of 500\u2009\u03bcm and O.D. of 700\u2009\u03bcm) was about 10\u2009cm long (Fig. S2a,b). The bare constantan-wire with a smooth surface was about 100\u2009\u03bcm in a diameter (Fig. S2c,d). After electrodeposition of ZnO, cone-shaped ZnO-NTs in a height of 5\u2009\u03bcm were radially grown on the constantan-wire surface (Fig. 1b\u2013d). In order to identify the SERS contribution from different nano-building blocks in the composite SERS system, we examined the SERS-activity of the Ag-NPs@ZnO-NTs@constantan-wire in the glass capillary filled with Rhodamine 6G (R6G) solution (Fig. 2a\u2013c), the mixture of Au-NRs and R6G solution in the glass capillary (Fig. 2d\u2013f) and the Ag-NPs@ZnO-NTs@constantan-wire filled with the mixed Au-NRs and R6G solution in the glass capillary (Fig. 2g\u2013i). The high-density radially distributed semiconducting ZnO-NTs were electrodeposited on the constantan wire, and a large quantity of plasmonic Ag-NPs with diameter about dozens of nanometers were decorated on each of the ZnO-NT (Fig. 2b and Fig. S3). As a result, the Ag-NPs@ZnO-NTs@constantan-wire system enabled the detection of 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u2009M R6G as shown in Fig. 2c. Similarly, the plasmonic Au-NRs (Fig. 2e) detected 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u2009M R6G (Fig. 2f). When the Au-NRs were filled in the space between the Ag-NPs@ZnO-NTs@constantan-wire and the inner wall of the glass capillary (Fig. 2g,h), the SERS intensity increased remarkably because it was a combination of the first two systems (shown in Fig. 2a,d). This system (Fig. 2g) had multiple-type plasmonic couplings among the neighboring Au-NRs in the solution, the neighboring Ag-NPs grown on ZnO-NT, the Ag-NPs grown on ZnO-NT and the nearby Au-NRs in solution. That is, high-density \u201chot spots\u201d were created in the 3D space, leading to strong enhancement of SERS signal (Fig. 2i). It should be mentioned that the SERS signal intensity changed with the focused position of the incident light, as can be seen more clearly in the corresponding depth SERS mapping shown in Fig. 2j, achieved by adjusting the focus of the incident light from the inner wall of the capillary downward to 300\u2009\u03bcm. There was an obvious region of better SERS activity about several microns, which almost matched the length of the ZnO-NTs (about 5\u2009\u03bcm). This further indicated that the high SERS activity was ascribed to the multi-type plasmonic couplings. As a result, this compact microfluidic SERS system was able to measure R6G as low as 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129\u2009M (Fig. S4). To control the multi-type plasmonic coupling induced SERS enhancement, the thermo-responsive pNIPAM microgels mixed with Au-NRs and the analyte were injected in the empty space between the Ag-NPs@ZnO-NTs@constantan-wire and the inner wall of the capillary. The heating experiments revealed that swelling and deswelling of thermo-responsive pNIPAM microgels had significant effect on the optical absorption of the Au-NRs embedded in pNIPAM microgels, which was revealed by the UV-Visible spectra recorded in a range from 20\u2009\u00b0C (completely swollen) to 45\u2009\u00b0C (completely collapsed) (Fig. S5). As the temperature drove the phase transformation of the pNIPAM, the hydrogels were collapsed as the temperature increased, creating a shift of the LSPR band from 821\u2009nm to 849\u2009nm as shown in Fig. S5. The red shift could come from two sources. First, the refractive index of the hydrogel increases with temperature, which redshifts the LSPR band22. Second, as the distance between the neighboring Au-NRs decreases, the LSPR modes will hybridize, leading to a redshift in the absorption23, 24, 25. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation has confirmed that both effects lead to equal magnitude shifts, comparing Figs S6 and S7, presenting a delineation of each factor from the UV-Vis spectrum (Fig. S5). Although the refractive index and the proximity based shifts coexist, only changes in the separation distance will lead to a largely enhanced local electromagnetic (EM) field, amplifying the SERS signal. The ZnO-NTs decorated with Ag-NPs had a local electric field enhancement |E/E0|2 of 190 for a 10\u2009nm Ag-NP and 100 for a 20\u2009nm Ag-NP (Fig. S8). The Au-NRs had a peak enhancement of |E/E0|2 of 400 under the 633\u2009nm excitation after being brought into contact end to end with a gap of 2\u2009nm. The enhancement for several separation distances within the range estimated from the UV-Vis absorption is shown in Fig. S9. For side-side alignment, the coupled LSPR peak is off-resonance at 633\u2009nm, and therefore does not have a large effect. The exact experimental configuration cannot be replicated for the Ag-NP, Au-NR, and ZnO-NT system after heating, so instead two cases are tested of which linear combinations can form all possible couplings. For Au-NR parallel to the Ag-NPs coated ZnO-NT, the field enhancement |E/E0|2 was as high as 1700 for the smallest separation distance and bigger Ag-NP size (Fig. 3f). For Au-NRs perpendicular to the ZnO-NT, the field enhancement |E/E0|2 was as high as 1450 (Fig. 3l). While the actual field enhancement will vary based on separation distance, alignment, and Ag-NP size, the FDTD simulations show that the increased Raman enhancement in the combined geometry originates in the close proximity and hybridization of the Ag-NP and Au-NR LSPR. In the present SERS system, the mixed thermo-responsive pNIPAM microgels and Au-NRs surrounding around the Ag-NPs@ZnO-NTs, work as a temperature-sensitive trapping layer for the analytes. The constantan wire serves as not only a support for the Ag-NPs@ZnO-NTs but also a controller for the temperature-driven phase transformation of pNIPAM when the circuit is switched on. As shown in Fig. 4a\u2013d, the SERS intensities increased significantly after the voltage was applied (Fig. 4c,d), which increased the enhancement factor almost 5 times, enabling the detection of a much lower concentration (10\u20139\u2009M) of R6G (Fig. S4). This great enhancement was ascribed to the local field (|E|2) intensity enhancement in the smaller gaps between the neighboring Au-NRs and those between the Au-NRs and the nearby Ag-NPs on ZnO-NT26, 27. The thermo-induced enhancement of local field intensity has been attested by surface enhanced fluorescence (SEF) of R6G. As shown in Movie S1 and Fig. S10 the fluorescence intensity increased so significantly that can be clearly identified by naked eyes after the voltage was applied. As the number of R6G molecules almost has not changed after the voltage was applied, the enhancement of fluorescence can be attributed to SEF based on the enhanced of local field intensity28, 29. After replacing Au-NRs with Au-NPs at the same concentration, the corresponding temperature-sensitive SERS effect was not so obvious (Fig. S11). That was due to the fact that shrinking of pNIPAM microgels had a stronger effect on one-dimensional Au-NRs than zero-dimensional Au-NPs. The temperature change in the system was measured with an infrared thermometer (model 59 mini, Fluke, Norwich, UK) roughly (Fig. S12). Although the temperature on the surfaces of capillaries rather than in the capillaries was measured, the measured data were valuable as the temperature tends to be stable after voltage is switched on for several seconds. The SERS intensity response to temperature was studied in the absence of pNIPAM (Fig. S13). It can be seen that the SERS intensity was reduced slightly after the voltage was applied, which was in agreement with the previous results30. This also confirmed that the SERS-intensity improvement was not caused by the temperature increase. Taking the collective effect, the battery-controlled composite SERS system can realize the well-controlled multi-type plasmonic couplings and effective trapping of the analytes, leading to high sensitivity of SERS detection. In addition, this integrated SERS system has capability of simultaneous detection of multiple-analytes. Two analytes with different binding affinities were mixed with the pNIPAM and Au-NRs mixture, and then injected into the integrated SERS system. Figure 4e,f present the detection of both para-aminothiophenol (PATP) and R6G, where PATP can be adsorbed strongly on the Au-NR surface due to strong Au\u2013S interaction while R6G has a weak interaction with the Au-NR surface. The SERS bands of both the analytes were observed in the spectra obtained before and after applying the voltage. For example, the 612, 774, 1179, 1362, 1310\u2009cm\u20131 bands of R6G (purple), which were assigned to C\u2013C\u2013C ring in-plane, C\u2013H out-of-plane bending, C\u2013C stretching vibration, aromatic C\u2013C stretching vibration and C=C stretching vibration of the R6G molecule, respectively31, 32. These bands were readily distinguished from the 1077, 1142 and 1432\u2009cm\u20131 shifts of PATP (dark yellow) assigned to a1 vibration mode and b2 vibration modes33. After the voltage was switched on, the intensity of all the bands increased almost 3\u2009~\u20094\u2009times. This indicated that the SERS intensity was modulated by strong temperature-driven trapping effect instead of the affinity of analyte with the SERS substrate. After switching on and off the battery for 4 cycles, the signal fluctuations were repeatable (Fig. S14), showing good stability of the SERS device. Except for the signal enhancement, the detection of the mixture solution with much lower concentration also has been realized (Fig. S15). To demonstrate the applicability of this integrated SERS system to real-world environmental samples, the integrated SERS system was employed to detect methyl parathion in lake water, as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S16. The pronounced bands at 851, 1108 and 1344\u2009cm\u20131 were assigned to P\u2013O stretching, C\u2013N stretching and C\u2013H bending in the methyl parathion molecule, respectively34, which provide the fingerprint proof for the analyte. Comparing Fig. 5a with Fig. 5b, it is found that switching on the voltage increased the intensity of all the SERS bands almost 3\u2009~\u20094\u2009times. Furthermore, the intensity of the fingerprint peak (1346\u2009cm\u20131) exhibited a linear dependence on the logarithmic concentration of methyl parathion (Fig. 5c). The calibration curves were fitted as y\u2009=\u2009845.54\u2009+\u2009699.24x (R2\u2009=\u200998.4%) for the voltage-off case, and y\u2009=\u20092662.02\u2009+\u20091320.26x (R2\u2009=\u200996.7%) for the voltage-on case. Here, y is the SERS intensity at 1344\u2009cm\u20131, and x is the logarithmic concentration of methyl parathion. The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 10\u20137\u2009M. This LOD was lower than the values of microfluidic-sensors reported previously34, 35. The performance of the device can be further improved by replacing the glass capillary with quartz capillary that has better transparency. It should be noted that although the maximum enhancement was present for a 532\u2009nm Raman laser for the FDTD simulations and PATP, a 633\u2009nm laser was used for the Raman testing to avoid the photodegradation and the background fluorescence of R6G (Fig. S17 and Table S1). In summary, the compact battery-controlled microfluidic SERS system exhibited high SERS activity due to multi-type plasmonic couplings, and had strong capability of trapping the analytes via the electric heating-driven thermo-responsive microgels. The high-density \u201chot spots\u201d created in the compact 3D space was responsible for the high SERS enhancement. It is worth noting that the thermo-responsive microgels played an important role in amplifying the SERS signal. When pNIPAM microgels were collapsed by heating, the gaps among the plasmonic nanostructures were reduced, leading to stronger plasmonic field coupling between the nanostructures. This work has shown that the integrated SERS system has a great potential in real-time detection of aquatic pollutants. Growth of cone-shaped ZnO-NT arrays on constantan wire: The constantan wire was washed sequentially with acetone, ethanol and DI water. The ZnO-NT arrays were then electrodeposited onto the constantan wire with a graphite sheet as the anode at a constant current density of 1\u2009mA for 1\u2009h in Zn(NH3)4(NO3)2 aqueous solution (100\u2009mL, 0.05\u2009M), which was prepared by gradually dropping ammonia water into Zn(NO3)2\u20226H2O aqueous solution until the solution became clear. The electrochemical cell was put into a water bath at 90\u2009\u00b0C during the whole electrodeposition. Finally, the ZnO-NTs@constantan-wire was cleaned with DI water and dried for use. Assembly of Ag-NPs on the ZnO-NTs@contantant-wire: The ZnO-NTs@contantant-wire was put in a 1\u2009M aqueous AgNO3 solution for 30\u2009min. Subsequent UV irradiation resulted in the formation of Ag-NPs on the surface of each ZnO-NT36. Then the Ag-NPs@ZnO-NTs@constantan-wire was inserted into the capillary. Preparation of Au-NRs and Au-NPs: Au-NRs were synthesized by the seed-mediated growth method37. Au-NPs were synthesized with a trisodium citrate reduction method38. The as-prepared Au-NRs and Au-NPs were dispersed in desired amount of DI water after wash treatment. Preparation of pNIPAM and Au-NRs mixture: 0.2\u2009g of pNIPAM was dissolved into 10\u2009mL of Au-NRs solution under magnetic stirring for 24\u2009hrs. Preparation of analyte samples: 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u2009M R6G was used to identify the SERS contribution from different building blocks. 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u2009M R6G was used as the SERS reporter in depth SERS mapping. For the thermo-responsive SERS samples, 200\u2009\u03bcL aliquots of Au-NR and pNIPAM mixture were stabilized at 4\u2009\u00b0C, and 200\u2009\u03bcL of analyte was added to each of the Au-NR and pNIPAM mixture to achieve 10\u22127\u2009M R6G, PATP/R6G (1.25\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125\u2009M: 1.25\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u2009M) respectively, and then injected into the capillary. Methyl parathion contaminated lake water was obtained by dissolving different amount of methyl parathion in lake water taken from Dongpu Lake. The morphology of the resultant products was characterized by a field-emission SEM (Hitachi S-4800) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford). TEM images of the individual products were taken under a JEM-2010 (JEOL, Japan). The excitation wavelength was 633\u2009nm from a HeNe laser. The SERS spectra were recorded on a confocal microprobe Raman system (Renishaw, inVia). The voltage applied to the constantan wire was 4.8\u2009V. FDTD simulations were performed to study the electromagnetic field distribution using the commercially available Optiwave software. The experimental configuration was replicated using the characterization data when possible. For the microgel after heating several possibilities were tested, with the largest enhancement assumed to give the largest increase to the signal. A simulation cell with a grid size of 0.5\u2009nm was used. The length and diameter of the Au-NR were 50\u2009nm and 10\u2009nm respectively. As shown in Fig. 2b, the Ag-NPs have two main sizes. For each kind we picked 10 nanoparticles randomly and figured out their average diameters. The bigger one has an average diameter around 20\u2009nm and the smaller one has an average diameter around 10\u2009nm. In the following simulations both situations have been considered. The experimental UV-Vis absorption was first matched using a full-spectrum simulation, then a monochromatic field at 633\u2009nm was used to see the EM field enhancement from the laser. The refractive index for gold and silver was matched to the data of Palik39. ZnO-NTs were given a refractive index of 2.03. A plane-wave source with both X and Y polarization was used. The refractive index of the microgel changes with heating22. To obtain the analyte sample, 200\u2009\u03bcL of R6G solution (10\u22123\u2009M) was added to 200\u2009\u03bcL Au-NR and pNIPAM mixture. The compact battery-controlled microfluidic SERS system was placed under a UV lamp (Fig. S10a). Then the analyte solution was injected into the system and the UV lamp was switched on. The fluorescence changing processes before and after heating have been recorded by normal camera (Fig. S10b,c and Movie S1). In order to identify the change of fluorescence intensities more clearly, the fluorescence images were obtained using a high-resolution wide field fluorescent microscope (Leica DMI 3000B). As shown in Fig. S10d to S10i the changes of fluorescence were distinct and repeatable. The temperature quenching of fluorescent molecules such as R6G has been widely accepted40. That is to say, the fluorescence improvement was not caused by the temperature increase directly. Our results were also counter to the further work, which using Au-NPs@pNIPAM core@shell colloids as temperature response fluorescence system. When the Au-NPs@pNIPAM core@shell colloids system being heated, the shrinking of pNIPAM molecule will drive the analyte molecule very close to the Au-NPs core, the fluorescence will be quenched18. In the compact battery-controlled microfluidic SERS system, when the voltage is switched on the shrinking of pNIPAM molecule will drive part of the R6G molecules much closer to the plasmonic Au-NRs, leading to the fluorescence quenching of these R6G molecules. On the other hand, the shrinking of pNIPAM molecule also abridge the spacing of the neighboring Au-NRs in the microgels, and that of the Au-NRs and their nearby Ag-NPs decorated on the ZnO-NTs, leading to the formation of high-density \u201chot spots\u201d in the three-dimensional (3D) space with much improved local field intensity. Thus, the fluorescence intensities from the rest of R6G molecules have been enhanced so greatly that can offset the quenching of high temperature and Au-NRs. How to cite this article: Zhou, Q. et al.

As described on page 4871, in each bundle, small gaps are formed between adjacent silver nanorods upon solution evaporation. At these sites, \"hot spots\" are generated where analyte molecules are trapped, leading to high sensitivity of the SERS sensor. ",

The prism-coupling and the end-face coupling methods separately measure the guiding modes and the near-field intensity distribution of the light at 633 and 1539 nm. The refractive index profiles of the planar and channel waveguides are reconstructed at 633 and 1539 nm. The finite difference beam propagation method is used to simulate the guided mode profiles. There is excellent agreement between the measured and simulated modes at 633 and 1539 nm.",

The Eu 2+-doped \u03b1-Si 3N 4 nanowires emitted strong yellow light, which is related to the 4f 65d-4f 7 transition of Eu 2+, upon a broad excitation wavelength range between 250 and 450 nm.

        "abstract": "Though polypyrrole (PPy) is widely used in flexible supercapacitors owing to its high electrochemical activity and intrinsic flexibility, limited capacitance and cycling stability of freestanding PPy films greatly reduce their practicality in real-world applications. Herein, we report a new approach to enhance PPyu0027s capacitance and cycling stability by forming a freestanding and conductive hybrid film through intercalating PPy into layered Ti3C2 (l-Ti3C2, a MXene material). The capacitance increases from 150 (300) to 203 mF cm\u22122 (406 F cm\u22123). Moreover, almost 100% capacitance retention is achieved, even after 20\u2009000 charging/discharging cycles. The analyses reveal that l-Ti3C2 effectively prevents dense PPy stacking, benefiting the electrolyte infiltration. Furthermore, strong bonds, formed between the PPy backbones and surfaces of l-Ti3C2, not only ensure good conductivity and provide precise pathways for charge-carrier transport but also improve the structural stability of PPy backbones. The freestanding PPy/l-Ti3C2 film is further used to fabricate an ultra-thin all-solid-state supercapacitor, which shows an excellent capacitance (35 mF cm\u22122), stable performance at any bending state and during 10\u2009000 charging/discharging cycles. This novel strategy provides a new way to design conductive polymer-based freestanding flexible electrodes with greatly improved electrochemical performances.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTCoatings are pre-fabricated on the China low activation martensitic (CLAM) steel via thermal spraying using Cr\u2013Fe\u2013Al\u2013Ti mixed powders. Crystalline and amorphous multiphase ceramic coatings are formed by a new laser surface in situ prefabricated coatings in situ reaction technology under atmospheric environments based on the Standard Gibbs free-energy theory. The grain boundary of incomplete recrystallisation section and perfect crystallisation section can be observed clearly by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The Al2O3 and TiO2 are found to be formed in the crystallisation section. In addition, we adopt a new method to measure bonding strength of coating and base material, and the average shear strength is found to be 290\u2005MPa. Further finite-element analysis shows that the shear stress distribution between the coatings and substrate is consistent with the experimental data. The average microhardness of the coatings is found to reach 1864.19 HV0.2.The coatings also exhibit the str...",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical performances of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT)-SiCN composite have been investigated. The sample was synthesized by a simple ultrasonication assisted method combined with high-temperature pyrolysis and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra, Raman spectra, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electronic microscopy. In this composite, CNT were uniformly distributed in the SiCN ceramic matrix, it retained the structural integrity during the polymer-ceramic conversion and had a relatively strong bonding with the SiCN ceramic matrix. When tested as anode in the half cell, the obtained composite exhibited enhanced rate capability and cyclic capacity than that of pristine SiCN powder, CNT and graphite, it could supply a capacity of 222.7 mA h/g when charged at 2000 nnA/g, while the SiCN anode showed nearly no capacity even at the low current density of 200 mA/g. It is expected that the CNT-SiCN composite, perhaps the series of CNT-PDC composites, may be prospective candidate for high power applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the present study, a nano-twinned microstructure is found in ion irradiated-Ti 3 AlC 2  by the characterizations of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction, combined with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction. No obvious difference in chemical composition was observed between pristine and irradiated samples. Ti 3 AlC 2  transforms to a cation-disordered Ti-Al-C system with the rocksalt structure after ion irradiation, in which Ti and Al atoms randomly occupy the cation sites and C atoms occupy the anion sites with occupancy of 0.5. The as-irradiated Ti 3 AlC 2  exhibits a nano-twinned structure and the twin thickness is in the range between 2 and 10\u00a0nm. Most of defects are located at or near the twin boundaries, which may be attributed to the segregation of Al. Based on the structural variations of complex oxides induced by ion irradiation and stability of solid solution (Ti, Al)  x  C, it is assumed that Ti 3 AlC 2  has a natural tendency to accommodate the defects through the chemical order to chemical disorder, low symmetry to high symmetry structural transformation. The formation mechanisms of the nano-twinned structure are related to the irradiation-induced antisite defect of cations, disorder of C atoms, and lattice structure characteristic of Ti 3 AlC 2 . Because the nano-twinned structure may significantly improve the irradiation tolerance of Ti 3 AlC 2  we study its stability under irradiation of Au ions at \u223c150\u00a0dpa. Only a moderate increase in the twin thickness is found and the nano-twinned structure is basically retained, which demonstrates the great stability of nano-twinned structure and makes Ti 3 AlC 2  a very promising irradiation tolerant material for advanced nuclear systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Phase transitions induced in hcp M  n +1 AX  n   phases (Ti 2 AlN, Ti 2 AlC, and Ti 4 AlN 3 ) by 1\u00a0MeV Au +  ion irradiation were investigated, over a series of ion fluences ranging from 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 14  to 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 16  ions cm \u22122 , by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and synchrotron grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Irradiation-induced structural evolutions were observed using high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Based on phase contrast imaging and electron diffraction pattern (EDP) simulations, the atomic-scale mechanisms for the phase transitions were determined. Transformations of the initial hcp phases to the intermediate \u03b3-phases and fcc phases were driven by the formation of Ti/Al antisite defects and extended stacking faults induced by ion irradiation. By comparing the transformation behavior of Ti 2 AlN with that of Ti 2 AlC and Ti 4 AlN 3  under the same irradiation conditions, using both the experimental data and first-principles calculations, the role of the X and  n  parameters in the radiation responses of M n+1 AX n  phases were elucidated. The susceptibilities of materials in this Ti-Al-X (X\u00a0=\u00a0C, N) system to irradiation-induced phase transitions were determined with respect to the bonding characteristics and compositions of these MAX phases. Ti 2 AlC is slightly less susceptible to the radiation-induced phase transformation than Ti 2 AlN, which is attributed to the stronger Ti-Al bond covalency in Ti 2 AlN. Ti 4 AlN 3  is more resistant to radiation-induced phase transformations than is Ti 2 AlN, due to the lower Al content and lower anion vacancy ratio in the irradiation-induced solid solution phases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Feasibility of Ti 3 AlC 2  phase as the protective coatings of accident tolerant fuels (ATFs) was investigated by means of ions irradiation, nanoindentation and transmission electron microscopy. Au ions irradiation was carried out on thin Ti 3 AlC 2  film to simulate the high displacement damage induced by the energetic particles in the nuclear reactors. Nanoindentation on the Ti 3 AlC 2  film was followed subsequently as a source of external stress to simulate the high pressure applied on the cladding in nuclear reactor cores of pressurized water reactors (PWRs). TEM was used to characterize the microstructural evolution of Ti 3 AlC 2  film after irradiation and nanoindentation. TEM analysis shows that Ti 3 AlC 2  film remains pristine layered structure and no amorphization was detected after irradiation to \u223c14 dpa. The combined nanoindentation and TEM show that no rupture and exfoliation of the Au-irradiated Ti 3 AlC 2  film occur even the extern stress and total elongation induced by nanoindentation reach to 16.6\u202fGPa and \u223c5%, respectively. The above results show good irradiation resistance and good ductility as well as excellent adhesion of the Ti 3 AlC 2  coating on the substrate after high dose irradiation and under high external stress. This indicates the good feasibility of Ti 3 AlC 2  thin films as the coatings of ATF claddings.",

        "abstract": "Nanolayered structural metallic ceramics, MAX phases, possess unique and highly attractive properties, including excellent radiation tolerance for some of them, whereas little is known about the detailed process of irradiation-induced structural transitions. In this study, the microstructural transformations and the stabilities of V2AlC and Cr2AlC induced by 1 MeV Au+ ions irradiation over a wide range of fluences were investigated by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GIXRD analyses show different processes of phase transitions and amorphization tolerance under irradiation between these two MAX phases, which are consistent with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results and the high-resolution observations. TEM observations reveal that the nanolamellar structures are disturbed and respective phase transitions occur at relatively low fluences, with the formation of stacking faults. As the fluence increases, Cr2AlC becomes completely amorphous, while V2AlC are gradually transformed into face-centered cubic (fcc) structure from the original hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure without amorphization, indicating that V2AlC is more tolerant of irradiation than Cr2AlC. Based on the phase contrast images and the electron-diffraction pattern (EDP) simulation of the microstructures, mechanisms of the phase transitions of V2AlC and Cr2AlC are proposed and the difference of the irradiation tolerance between them is discussed.",

Grazing incident x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) reveals that a new set of diffraction peaks appears after ion irradiation for both MAX phases and the positions of diffraction peaks gradually shift towards lower 2 \u03b8  values with increasing fluence. Transmission electron microscope characterizations show both MAX phases experience a similar structure transformation at low fluences, forming an intermediate structure. The  d -spacings derived from electron diffraction analysis of intermediate structures are basically consistent with that of new peaks in GIXRD. At high fluences a nano-twinned microstructure is found in Ti 2 AlN, but no such microstructure is observed in Ti 4 AlN 3 . Based on the simulation results of electron diffractions and the irradiation responses of other MAX phases, the structure characteristics and formation mechanisms of the intermediate structure are derived and the discrepancy in the phase stability of both MAX phases at high fluences is discussed.",

In complex ceramic materials, it is a challenge to understand the nature of structural disordering, due to the difficulty of direct, atomic-scale experimental observations. Here we report the direct imaging of ion irradiation-induced antisite defects in Mn+1AXn phases using double CS-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and provide compelling evidence of order-to-disorder phase transformations, overturning the conventional view that irradiation causes phase decomposition to binary fcc-structured Mn+1Xn. With the formation of uniformly distributed cation antisite defects and the rearrangement of X anions, disordered solid solution \u03b3-(Mn+1A)Xn phases are formed at low ion fluences, followed by gradual transitions to solid solution fcc-structured (Mn+1A)Xn phases. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the order-to-disorder transformations in Mn+1AXn phases and proposes a method for the synthesis of new solid solution (Mn+1A)Xn phases by tailoring the disorder.",

Here, we report that lactate accumulation contributes to angiogenesis and neurogenesis in ICH. In the first set of the experiment,\u00a0 a\u00a0rat model of ICH was induced by injecting collagenase into the brain. The effects of lactate accumulation on the neurological function, apoptosis, and numbers of newborn endothelial cells and neurons, as well as the proliferation-associated signaling pathway, were evaluated in the rat brain. \u00a0In the second set, exogenous L-lactate was infused into intact rat brains so that its effects could be further\u00a0assessed. Following ICH, lactate accumulated around the hematoma; the numbers of PCNA/vWF nuclei and PCNA/DCX cells were significantly increased compared with the numbers in the Sham group. Moreover, ICH induced translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65 into the nucleus, resulting in a notable upregulation of VEGF and bFGF mRNAs and proteins compared with the levels in the Sham controls. Administration of a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor dramatically inhibited these effects, decreased the vascular density, and aggravated neurological severity scores and apoptosis after ICH. After exogenous L-lactate infusion, the numbers of PCNA/vWF nuclei and PCNA/DCX cells were strikingly increased compared with the numbers in the Sham controls. In addition, lactate facilitated NF-\u03baB translocation to induce increased transcription of VEGF and bFGF. Co-infusion with an NF-\u03baB inhibitor significantly inhibited these effects. These data suggest that lactate potentiates angiogenesis and neurogenesis by activating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway following ICH.",

        "abstract": "Chlorinated phenols are a class of contaminants found in water and have been regarded as a great potential risk to environment and human health. It is thus urgent to develop effective techniques to remove chlorinated phenols in wastewater. For this purpose, we employed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in this work and studied the efficiency of DBD for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), one of the most typical chlorophenols in the environment. The effects of pH value, applied voltage and plasma-working gases on the dichlorophenol-removal efficiency were investigated. The results demonstrate that DBD plasma could successfully degrade 2,4-DCP, achieving efficiency of 98.16% (k\u202f=\u202f1.09 min) in the Ar-DBD system, and 77.60% (k\u202f=\u202f0.48 min) in the N-DBD system, with the process following the first-order kinetics. The removal efficiency was reduced in the presence of radical scavengers, confirming that hydroxyl radicals played a key role in the degradation process, while other active substances were also found such as nitrogen radicals in the N-DBD system, which was found to have also contribution to the degradation of 2,4-DCP. The intermediates and final products generated in the degradation process were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Based on the identification of intermediates, the degradation pathways and mechanism were proposed and discussed. Besides, the toxicity of the DBD treated 2,4-DCP solution was also assessed using GFP-expressing recombinant Escherichia coli (E.\u00a0coli) as the testing organism, showing that plasma treatment could substantially reduce the toxic effect of 2,4-DCP.",

        "abstract": "Norfloxacin is a synthetic antibiotics drug which is widely used in the treatment of infectious diseases and also often carelessly released into natural environment resulting in antibiotics-contaminated wastewater. In this work, we employed atmospheric-pressure non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) to treat norfloxacin-contaminated water and investigated the degradation efficiency and mechanism for the plasma treatments under different conditions with varied working gas atmospheres. Our results showed that the DBD efficiency for norfloxacin degradation depended on reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) produced in the plasma treatment, while the plasma-induced hydroxyl radical played a critical role in the norfloxacin degradation. For O-DBD, except for the contribution from reactive oxygen species (ROS), ozone could also play an important role. For N-DBD, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) could work synergistically with HO to enhance the degradation effect. We also checked the plasma activated liquid (PAL) effect and analyzed the degradation products so that the degradation mechanism and pathways could be elucidated. This work may therefore provide the guidance for effective and feasible application of low-temperature plasma technology in treatment of antibiotics-contaminated wastewater.",

        "abstract": "As a traditional Chinese medicine, Ganoderma lingzhi has attracted increasing attention for both scientific research and medical application. In this work, in order to improve the production of polysaccharides from an original wide-type (WT) strain (named \"RWY-0\") of Ganoderma lingzhi, we applied atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) nonthermal plasma to the protoplasts of RWY-0 for mutagenesis treatment. Through a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay, at least 10 mutagenic strains were confirmed. They also showed different mycelium characteristics in terms of shape, color, size and biomass in liquid fermentation. The mutant strains were examined by infrared spectroscopy, and based on the established near-infrared (NIR) quantification model, the polysaccharide contents in these mutants were quantitatively evaluated. As a result, we found that the Ganoderma polysaccharide contents in some of the mutant strains were significantly changed compared with that of the original WT strain. The polysaccharide content of RWY-1 G. lingzhi was considerably higher than that of the WT strain, with an increase of 25.6%. Thus, this preliminary work demonstrates the extension of the plasma mutagenesis application in acquiring polysaccharide-enhanced Ganoderma lingzhi mutants and shows the usefulness of NIR spectroscopy in the rapid screening of mutagenic strains for other important ingredients.",

Ganoderic acid A (GAA) is the first discovered ganoderic acids reported in the literature, which is also one of most abundant triterpenoids of Ganoderma lucidum. Especially, GAA has been extensively investigated in recent decades for its positive medicinal activities. However, the vibrational properties of GAs have rarely been studied or reported. In this work, we focused on the typical GAA and studied the infrared (IR) and Raman spectra based on both experiments and DFT calculations. As such, we could not only achieve the assignments of the vibrational modes, but also from the IR and Raman spectra, we found that the spectral region from 1500\u202fcm to 1800\u202fcm is particularly useful for distinguishing different types of GAs. In addition, its dehydrogenated derivative ganoderenic acid A (GOA) was also studied, which could be identified due to its spectral feature of strong IR and Raman bands around 1620\u202fcm. This work therefore may facilitate the application of IR and Raman spectroscopies in the inspection and quality control of Ganoderma lucidum.",

        "abstract": "Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are one of the most abundantly applied nanomaterials in nanotechnology-based industries and they may cause unexpected environmental and health risks with their physicochemical transformations in the environment. Currently, there is still a lack of the in-depth understanding of the toxicity of aged ZnO NPs to aquatic organisms, particularly demanding quantitative analysis of the physicochemical transformations to distinguish their contributions in the toxicity assessment. For this purpose, therefore, we initiated the study of the toxicity of aged ZnO NPs to the model aquatic microalga, i.e. Chlorella vulgaris, and with the aid of spectroscopic tools for characterization and quantification of the physicochemical transformations, we scrutinized the toxicity variations for ZnO NPs with different aging times. As a result, we found that the toxicity altered in an abnormal manner with the aging time, i.e. the toxicity of aged ZnO NPs for 30 days showed the higher toxicity to the green alga than the fresh ZnO NPs or the ZnO NPs aged for longer time (e.g. 120 and 210 days). Through spectroscopic tools such as XRD, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, we made both the qualitative and quantitative assessments of the physicochemical changes of the ZnO NPs, and confirmed that in the early stage, the toxicity mainly stemmed from the release of zinc ions, but with longer aging time, the neoformation of the nanoparticles played the critical role, leading to the overall reduced toxicity due to the less toxic hydrozincite and zinc hydroxide in the transformed compounds.",

        "abstract": "It is known that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can modify acetylation of tumor cells and affect radiation sensitivity, or, radiosensitivity. While previous studies showed that trichostatin A (TSA, a typical HDACi) could enhance cell acetylation and so be used as radiation-sensitizer in radiotherapy, we questioned if the radiosensitivity is correlated with cellular acetylation directly. So we inspected radiation response of HeLa cells treated with TSA and investigated the time-dependent effect on radiosensitivity. To our surprise, HeLa cells treated with 200\u2009nM TSA for shorter period (6\u2009h) had relatively higher acetylation level but apparently less radiation damage compared to the irradiated cells with same radiation dose treatment of TSA but for longer time (24\u2009h) with lower acetylation level, gainsaying the direct relationship between acetylation and radiosensitivity. We explained that the anti-oxidation activity for the combined treatments with TSA-radiation gave rise to the enhanced radiation protection of the cells at certain period of time. This work has therefore for the first time presented the experimental evidence showing that there is no direct relationship between acetylation and radiation sensitivity, and our results may also provide the guidance for optimized radiotherapy assisted by HDACis in cancer treatment.",

To achieve the effective SERS substrate, canonical anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates with regular array of nanotips were fabricated, and by plasma sputtering the gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) were distributed on the nanotips to form the Au-NPs array with plenty of hotspots. The SERS substrates were utilized to examine the serum samples taken from the mice with the treatment of total body irradiation (TBI) of X-ray. The impact of TBI on the mice was analyzed and it was found that the SERS peak intensity at 532\u202fcm increased as a function of duration or dose of TBI. We confirmed that this Raman signature belongs to the myoglobin as a biomarker for the muscle damage due to the radiation caused injury. Furthermore, we also tested several blood and urine specimen of cancer patients who received radiotherapy. The results showed that our approach to some extent could distinguish the bio-samples from normal, X-ray treated and untreated individuals. Therefore, the proposed methodology may have the potential for prompt prognosis of radiation injury at early stage.",

In contrast with the previous work, we employed flow cytometry to examine the algal cells, so that we could assess the dead and living cells with more accuracy, and distinguish an intermediate state of algal cells which were verified as apoptotic. Our results showed that the numbers of both dead and apoptotic cells increased with DBD treatment delay time, and hydrogen peroxide produced by DBD was the main reason for the time-delayed inactivation effect. However, apart from the influence of hydrogen peroxide, the DBD-induced initial injures on the algal cells during the discharge period also played a considerable role in the inactivation of the DBD treated cells, as indicated by the measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the algal cells. We therefore propose an effective approach to utilization of non-thermal plasma technique that makes good use of the residual inactivation effect to optimize the experimental conditions in terms of discharge time and delay time, so that more efficient treatment of cyanobacterial blooms can be achieved.",

The PE-ABR hydrochar showed remarkable adsorption capability for removal malachite green (MG), with the maximum adsorption capacity of PE-ABR hydrochar for MG was 89.05 mg g\u22121. The adsorption equilibrium is consistent with Langmuiru0027s model, and the adsorption kinetics follows the pseudo-second-order equation. Therefore, this work have demonstrated that harmful ABR can be utilized not only as a potential material for production of phycocyanin, but also an excellent source for hydrochar for removal dyes in contaminated wastewater with high adsorption efficiency.",

To improve astaxanthin productivity, nonthermal plasma can be used to produce mutant algal strains with enhanced production of astaxanthin. In this work, atmospheric pressure argon dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) was used for mutation induction. Several new algal strains with increased growth rate and higher astaxanthin accumulation were obtained. For analysis of the DBD-treated algal mutants, genetic variation was examined by random amplification of polymorphic DNA, and the pigment pattern in response to inhibitors (diphenylamine and nicotine) of carotenoid biosynthetic pathway was characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, photosynthetic activity and gene expression were also examined by pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Our results confirmed that the enhanced astaxan...",

A structural transition with an increased c lattice parameter and a decreased a lattice parameter occurs after irradiation to doses above 1 dpa. Nevertheless, the modified structure is stable up to the dose of 5.2 dpa without obvious lattice disorder. The three samples irradiated to doses above 1 dpa have comparable lattice parameters and hardness values, suggesting a saturation of irradiation effects in Cr2AlC. The structural transition and irradiation effects saturation are ascribed to irradiation-induced antisite defects (CrAl and AlCr) and C interstitials, which is supported by the calculations of the formation energies of various defects in Cr2AlC. The irradiation-induced antisite defects and C interstitials may be critical to understand the excellent resistance to irradiation-induced amorphization of MAX phases.",

Here, Ti 3 AlC 2  coatings were synthesized using liquid plasma spraying (LPS). Although the average temperature of particles measured in LPS was higher than 2200\u00a0K, enough to decompose Ti 3 AlC 2  phase, the resulting sprayed Ti 3 AlC 2  particles were intact. This is probably due to formation of a protective oxide on the surface in the high-temperature steam. The phase purity of Ti 3 AlC 2  coating was high when using water as solvent, but low with a solvent of a mixture of water and alcohol. Different pH values of the solutions influence the phase purity of Ti 3 AlC 2  coatings. The alkaline solutions show detrimental effect on the conservation of Ti 3 AlC 2  phase. The mechanism of improved structural integrity of Ti 3 AlC 2  phase at high temperature through LPS was revealed by microstructural and compositional analysis.",

Around 30% swelling at a fluence of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 15  ions/cm 2  was characterized using atomic force microscopy. Severe swelling of the graphite crystallites caused stresses between adjacent crystallites, but leaved no intergranular cracks on the polished surface, which was ascribed to irradiation-induced creep of graphite. The pore morphology was affected by the anisotropic swelling. We found many contracted pores but only one expanded pore, indicating a decreased porosity induced by irradiation. After annealing at 1100\u00a0\u00b0C, TEM characterization showed clearly increased lattice order and decreased width of the (002) diffraction arc, indicating the annihilation of dislocations and recovery of basal plane rotations.

The irradiation experiments were carried out at room temperature and 600\u00a0\u00b0C, and the ion fluences correspond to a calculated peak damage dose of 0.5, 2 and 12 dpa, respectively. TEM results show the formation of solute clusters or dislocation loops with a number density of approximately 5\u201314\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 22 \u00a0m \u22123  and sizes between 3 and 10\u00a0nm\u00a0at room temperature due to irradiation induced defects and their evolution. Moreover, the peak shift with increasing ion dose observed in XRD diffraction patterns reveals the lattice distortion induced by ion irradiation. As far as the case of high temperature irradiation, several solute clusters with the same size were observed, whereas the number density was smaller than that of the former case. The calculated indentation values in irradiated samples were found to be much higher in comparison to the unirradiated one, indicating the dose dependent effect of irradiation on hardness. However, in the case of the ion irradiation at 600\u00a0\u00b0C, the hardness value of samples was significantly decreased. The relationship between ion irradiation induced microstructural evolution and the changes in the mechanical properties of this weld metal is discussed in the context of ion dose and irradiation temperature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cr 2 AlC materials were irradiated with 7\u00a0MeV Xe 26+  ions and 500\u00a0keV He 2+  ions at room temperature. A structural transition with an increased  c  lattice parameter and a decreased  a  lattice parameter occurs after irradiation to doses above 1\u00a0dpa. Nevertheless, the modified structure is stable up to the dose of 5.2\u00a0dpa without obvious lattice disorder. The three samples irradiated to doses above 1\u00a0dpa have comparable lattice parameters, hardness and modulus values, suggesting a saturation of irradiation effects in Cr 2 AlC. The structural transition and irradiation effects saturation are ascribed to irradiation-induced antisite defects (Cr Al  and Al Cr ) and C interstitials, which is supported by the calculations of the formation energies of various defects in Cr 2 AlC. The irradiation-induced antisite defects and C interstitials may be critical to understand the excellent resistance to irradiation-induced amorphization of MAX phases.",

Cysteine is one of the amino acids that have a rotating dihedral angle and several possible adsorption sites, so there could be many possible adsorption conformations. At present, the adsorption conformation of cysteine on the gold surface has not been solved, although previous work had explored the conformations based on DFT method, but no explicit experimental evidence was provided. Nevertheless, the previous work had indicated that the adsorption conformations of some simple rigid molecules on the surface of metal nanoparticles could be identified through SERS experimental data. Therefore, in this work, we attempted to figure out the conformation and adsorption sites of the flexible typical amino acid cysteine on gold nanoparticle surface by combining both DFT and SERS methods. We found that the adsorpt...",

        "abstract": "Adsorption of nucleic acid bases on metal surface of nanoparticles has received much attention recently in bio- and nanotechnology, while it still remains a controversial problem in how adenine is adsorbed onto the metal surface. As the nitrogen in adenine plays an important role in the molecular recognition and interaction, the spectral feature related to the nitrogen is the key to analysis of the adsorption configurations. For this purpose, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations at B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level for the simulation of adsorption configurations, and in the meantime we checked the corresponding surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of 15N fully labeled adenine adsorbed on the surfaces of silver and gold nanoparticles both experimentally and theoretically. The agreement of spectral positions, intensities, and isotopic shifts of the SERS bands, suggests that adenine adsorbed on either silver or gold surface takes the same adsorption configuration in which N7H adenine interac...",

In order to evaluate polysaccharide content in Ganoderma mycelia obtained in the fermentation process quickly and accurately, in this work we employed infrared spectroscopy to examine different Ganoderma stains of samples from diversified sources. Through mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy, we could identify the most relevant spectral bands required for polysaccharide evaluation, and through near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, we could establish the quantification model for making satisfactory prediction of polysaccharide ingredient content. As such, we have achieved an effective and convenient approach to quantitative assessment of the total polysaccharides in Ganoderma mycelia but also demonstrated that infrared spectroscopy can be a powerful tool for quality control of Ganoderma polysaccharides obtained from industrial production.",

Chloride is essential for all life, but whether chloride can modulate the compositions and levels of plasma-produced reactive species and consequently influence the bactericidal efficiency is still undefined. In this work, the plasma-induced inactivation behavior of Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis without or with the presence of chloride were investigated. Potentiation effect of chloride on bacterial inactivation was observed for O2 plasma, but attenuation effect was discovered for N2 and air plasmas. For unveiling the underlying mechanisms, the influence of chloride on the production of reactive species including chlorine, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide and nitrite was examined.",

        "abstract": "The detection of highly toxic CS2, which is known as a notorious occupational hazard in various industrial processes, is important from both environmental and public safety perspectives. We describe here a robust type of chemical-reaction-based supramolecular fluorescent nanoprobes for ratiometric determination of CS2 with high selectivity and sensitivity in water medium. The micellar nanoprobes self-assemble from amphiphilic pyrene-modified hyperbranched polyethylenimine (Py-HPEI) polymers with intense pyrene excimer emission. Selective sensing is based on a CS2-specific reaction with hydrophilic amino groups to produce hydrophobic dithiocarbamate moieties, which can strongly quench the pyrene excimer emission via a known photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism. Therefore, the developed micellar nanoprobes are free of the H2S interference problem often encountered in the widely used colorimetric assays and proved to show high selectivity over many potentially competing chemical species. Importantly, the developed approach is capable of CS2 sensing even in complex tap and river water samples. In addition, in view of the modular design principle of these powerful micellar nanoprobes, the sensing strategy used here is expected to be applicable to the development of various sensory systems for other environmentally important guest species.

        "abstract": "Abstract   A polymer-based visible and quantitative fluorometric assay for CO 2  gas is constructed using branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) covalently modified with tetraphenylethylene (TPE). The sensing mechanism relies on the reaction of CO 2  with alkylamines of PEI to induce the \u201csolution-to-precipitation\u201d phase transition of the sensory polymer (TPE\u2013PEI), thus resulting in strong aggregation-induced fluorescent emission of TPE\u2013PEI. It works in a relatively environmental benign ethanol medium and avoids the use of toxic amine compounds with unpleasant odor. More importantly, this system is proved to be highly tolerant to possibly coexisting water, carbon monoxide, acid SO 2  and H 2 S gases as well as many common volatile organic compounds. These characteristics make the presently developed fluorescent chemosensor hold great potential for many real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent \u201cturn-on\u201d probe is presented for dissolved carbon dioxide (dCO 2 ) detection in aqueous medium. This probe is based on perylene bisimide-functionalized hyperbranched polyethylenimine (PBI-HPEI) polymer, which exhibits typical NIR fluorescence due to the excimer emission of \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacked PBI fluorophores. Both UV\u2013vis absorption and fluorescent spectroscopy studies reveal that the PBI-HPEI polymer shows significantly dCO 2 -sensitive NIR emission via a known photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism. Importantly, this sensory system is characterized with facile synthesis, fast response, excellent water-solubility and wide linear detection concentration range. It is thus capable of detecting dCO 2  even in real-world carbonated beverages and drinking water samples. Additionally, in view of the modular design principle of the present fluorescent polymer with typical NIR excimer emission of \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacked PBI molecules, the proposed strategy is expected to be applicable to the fabrication of novel versatile NIR-emitting sensory materials.",

There was almost no effect on the efficiency of ammonium carbonate when Ca-Mg fertilizer was applied with ammonium carbonate. The effect of P fertilizer mixed with Ca-Mg fertilizer was weakened, maybe which was resulted from P and Ca were fixed. The effect of Ca-Mg fertilizer mixed with humic acid was the highest, and showed the greatest potential for increasing yield, so it was a kind of fertilizer to be recommended. Not only both the absorption of N, P, K and the recovery rate of fertilizer were improved, but also the commodity character of Chinese flowering cabbage was more better, and it obtained better benefit when series of Ca-Mg fertilizer were applied.",

The experimental data of the natural frequencies of heat exchangers used for Qishan Phase I Nuclear Power Plant are compared with the computational results from the shell-beam models for corresponding heat exchangers of C-2 program. The experimental and numerical results agree quite well, which implies that the shell-beam finite element simplification is applicable to the heat exchangers.

        "title": "Perspective on the  Study of Essentiality of  Literary Ideology",
        "abstract": "In the early years of the New Period, along with the constant improvement of the social and political environment, the contestations among the exponents in the academic circles became lively; the viewpoint that (\u2033literature) is a special ideology\u2033 was also hotly debated. In the beginning of 1988, Luan Changda and Dong Xuewen began to query about the essentiality of ideology, and brought a severe concussion to the concept of essentiality of literary ideology which was considered as the standard till that time, that triggered the contestation concerning the relationship between ideology and literature among the academic circles, which lasted for several years. The question whether the literature's true nature consists in ideology became the core proposition of the contestation. \ue004The essentiality of ideology recovered its predominant position in the contestation, and the scholars had sufficient and fruitful discussions on the definition of the basic concept of the ideology, the relationship between the literature and ideology, the dialectical relationship between the essentiality of literary ideology and the non-literary ideology, and the aesthetical ideology of literature etc. The fundamental premise of the deep probing into in the literary ideology is to understand correctly the original idea of the classic writers of Marxism and to clarify the ideology and its related concepts. As Lu Meilin said that too narrow or too broad interpretation of the connotation of the ideology is one of the main reasons that caused the disorder in the field of literature theories, and he pointed out that ideology is a concept about the whole organism of composing factors. Many scholars, such as Zhang Shouying, Bian Pingshu, and Li Sixiao, are interested in the composing factors of ideology. While they focused on the analysis of the concept of ideology, scholars like Feng Yi and Huang Lizhi adhered to the essentiality of ideology and launched the in-depth discussion on the relationship between the main role of literature and the nature of ideology. In the 1980s, scholars including Qian Zhongwen, Tong Qingbing and Wang Yuanxiang, deliberated on the aesthetical ideology and the aesthetical theory of reflection.   \ue004In the field of the aesthetical ideology, they made a systematic and in-depth investigation on the nature of literature, successfully resolved the conflict between the literary ideology and the aesthetical consciousness, and opened a new window for us to understand the correlative contradictions between the form and the contents, the emotion and the reason, expression and representation, humanity and the class nature. Although there is a limitation in its failure to explain efficiently how to achieve the harmony between aesthetical consciousness and the ideological factors of literature, the aesthetical ideology transcended the bondage of pure epistemology, and fitted a dialectical link between the literary ideology and the aesthetical factors, and in this way enriched and developed the Marxist viewpoint on the nature of literature. \ue004In conclusion, when we affirm that the innate nature of literature consists in the ideology, we must know that literature also contains some non-ideological factors, and in order to prevent the tendency of simplicity and philistinism in the field of literary studies and to cognize the scientific literary phenomena, it is very important to penetrate into these non-ideological factors.",

The sensitivity and specificity of ultrastructural GOM deposite and NOTCH3 N-terminal polyclonal antibody for the diagnosis of CADASIL were evaluated.Results The sensibility of ultrastructural GOM deposite in the 12 patients was 58.3% and the specificity was 93.8%. The sensibility of NOTCH3 N-terminal polyclonal antibody was 66.6% and the specificity was 96.9%. With a combination of the two methods,the sensibility and the specificity for the diagnosis of CADASIL were 91.7% and 95.4%,respectively.Conclusions A combination of ultrastructural GOM examination with NOTCH3 N-terminal polyclonal antibody can improve the diagnostic efficiency of CADASIL.",

Methods: PC12 cells were differentiated by NGF and co-transfected with plasmid of HAP1A-CFP and (or) pro-BDNF-ds-red. Then the cells were incubated with either recombinant ds-red-labeled pro-BDNF,or in combination with sheep anti-BDNF antibodies,rabbit anti-p75NTR,or sheep anti-sortilin antibodies. The expression of fluorescence and its intercellular location were determined by laser scanning confocal microscope. Cortical neurons from HAP1+/+ and HAP1-/- mice at postnatal day 1 were cultured and treated with biotin labeled pro-BDNF to trigger endocytosis. After 60 min,the cells were washed and fixed,followed by immunostaining and confocal imaging. Results: Co-transfected PC12 cells or cells transfected with HAP1A-CFP which were incubated with recombinant ds-red-labeled pro-BDNF showed almost complete co-localization of HAP1 with pro-BDNF. The antibodies to BDNF,p75NTR,and sortilin abolished co-localization of HAP1 with pro-BDNF. In addition,the labeled pro-BDNF was detected in almost all HAP1+/+,but not in HAP1-/- cortical neurons. Conclusion: HAP1 plays an important role in the endocytosis of pro-BDNF.",

Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into three groups: control group normal rats, DM8 group with an 8-weeks course of diabetes and DM24 group with 24-weeks course of diabetes (n=8 each). The expression of P-selectin (Ps) in cerebral microvascular and plasm C-reactive protein (CRP) were detected.Results Ps was not expressed in the control group. Ps positive endothelial cells were mostly expressed in microvessels with a diameter of 7.5-30 \u03bcm in rats with diabetes. The expression of Ps was significant of higher in the two DM groups than that in the control group (P<0.01). There were significant differences in the Ps expression between the DM24 and DM8 groups (P<0.05). Plasm CRP concentration increased in the DM8 and DM24 groups compared with that in the control group (P<0.01). A significant difference was also observed in the CRP concentration between the DM8 and DM24 groups (P<0.005).Conclusions The increased expression of Ps in cerebral microvascular may be related to chronic low grade inflamemation, which may be one of the mechanisms of cerebral microvascular disorders in diabetes rats.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between C923T (Ala308Val) polymorphism in the exon10 of P47(phox) gene and cerebral infarction and to evaluate the effect of C923T polymorphism on plasma lipid levels.Peripheral blood samples were collected from 110 patients with cerebral infarction, 100 sex and age-matched healthy controls, and 102 members of 10 cerebral infarction pedigrees 19 of which were cerebral infarction patients. The polymorphism in P47(phox) gene was determined by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. Plasma lipid levels were measured by routine methods.Three gene types, CC, CT, and TT were found in the C923T (Ala308Val) polymorphism site. No statistically significant differences were found in the frequencies of genotypes and alleles of C923T polymorphism between the controls and cerebral infarction patients (all P > 0.05). The serum levels of triglyceride of cerebral infarction patients and controls with the CT genotype were markedly higher than those of the cerebral infarction patients and controls with the CC genotype (both P < 0.05).There is no association between the C923T polymorphism and cerebral infarction. C923Tpolymorphism is associated with plasma lipid metabolism.",

        "abstract": "The turmeric derivative curcumin protects against cerebral ischemic injury. We previously demonstrated that curcumin activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), a ligand-activated transcription factor involved in both neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. This study tested whether the neuroprotective effects of curcumin against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced injury of rat cortical neurons are mediated (at least in part) by PPAR\u03b3. Curcumin (10 \u03bcM) potently enhanced PPAR\u03b3 expression and transcriptional activity following OGD/R. In addition, curcumin markedly increased neuronal viability, as evidenced by decreased lactate dehydrogenase release and reduced nitric oxide production, caspase-3 activity, and apoptosis. These protective effects were suppressed by coadministration of the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzanilide (GW9662) and by prior transfection of a small-interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PPAR\u03b3, treatments that had no toxic effects on healthy neurons. Curcumin reduced OGD/R-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and inhibited the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, as indicated by reduced release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor and maintenance of both the mitochondrial membrane potential and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Again, GW9662 or PPAR\u03b3 siRNA transfection mitigated the protective effects of curcumin on mitochondrial function. Curcumin suppressed I\u03baB kinase phosphorylation and I\u03baB degradation, thereby inhibiting nuclear factor-\u03ba B (NF-\u03baB) nuclear translocation, effects also blocked by GW9662 or PPAR\u03b3 siRNA. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PPAR\u03b3 interacted with NF-\u03baB p65 and inhibited NF-\u03baB activation. The present study provides strong evidence that at least some of the neuroprotective effects of curcumin against OGD/R are mediated by PPAR\u03b3 activation.",

Firstly, the problem concerned is described facing the trend of ocean shipping industry development and the characteristics of ocean shipping container revenue management. Then, a multi-leg multi-product capacity allocation model is proposed considering empty container transportation. Due to the demand uncertainty, a novel robust optimization method is proposed to solve the model. Finally, we explained the application value of this model and solution method to the container ocean shipping companies by digital simulation.",

        "abstract": "Thiopurine drugs are well established treatments in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but their use is limited by significant adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is an important enzyme involved in thiopurine metabolism. Several clinical guidelines recommend determining TPMT genotype or phenotype before initiating thiopurine therapy. Although several studies have investigated the association between TPMT polymorphisms and thiopurine-induced ADRs, the results are inconsistent. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether there is an association between TPMT polymorphisms and thiopurine-induced ADRs using meta-analysis.We explored PubMed, Web of Science and Embase for articles on TPMT polymorphisms and thiopurine-induced ADRs. Studies that compared TPMT polymorphisms with-ADRs and without-ADRs in IBD patients were included. Relevant outcome data from all the included articles were extracted and the pooled odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Revman 5.3 software.Fourteen published studies, with a total of 2,206 IBD patients, which investigated associations between TPMT polymorphisms and thiopurine-induced ADRs were included this meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that TPMT polymorphisms were significantly associated with thiopurine-induced overall ADRs and bone marrow toxicity; pooled ORs were 3.36 (95%CI: 1.82-6.19) and 6.67 (95%CI: 3.88-11.47), respectively. TPMT polymorphisms were not associated with the development of other ADRs including hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, gastric intolerance, flu-like symptoms and skin reactions; the corresponding pooled ORs were 1.27 (95%CI: 0.60-2.71), 0.97 (95%CI: 0.38-2.48), 1.82 (95%CI: 0.93-3.53), 1.28 (95%CI: 0.47-3.46) and 2.32 (95%CI: 0.86-6.25), respectively.Our meta-analysis demonstrated an association of TPMT polymorphisms with overall thiopurine-induced ADRs and bone marrow toxicity, but not with hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, flu-like symptoms, gastric intolerance and skin reactions. These findings suggest that pretesting the TPMT genotype could be helpful in clinical practice before initiating thiopurine therapy. However, white blood cell count analysis should be the mainstay for follow-up.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease with multiple underlying causative genetic mutations. The B-type Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) plays an important role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade during CRC. The presence of BRAFV600E mutation can determine the response of a tumor to chemotherapy. However, the association between the BRAFV600E mutation and the clinicopathological features of CRC remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effect of BRAFV600E mutation on the clinicopathological characteristics of CRC.We identified studies that examined the effect of BRAFV600E mutation on CRC within the PubMed, ISI Science Citation Index, and Embase databases. The effect of BRAFV600E on outcome parameters was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study using a fixed effects or random effects model.25 studies with a total of 11,955 CRC patients met inclusion criteria. The rate of BRAFV600 was 10.8% (1288/11955). The BRAFV600E mutation in CRC was associated with advanced TNM stage, poor differentiation, mucinous histology, microsatellite instability (MSI), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). This mutation was also associated with female gender, older age, proximal colon, and mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) methylation.This meta-analysis demonstrated that BRAFV600E mutation was significantly correlated with adverse pathological features of CRC and distinct clinical characteristics. These data suggest that BRAFV600E mutation could be used to supplement standard clinical and pathological staging for the better management of individual CRC patients, and could be considered as a poor prognostic marker for CRC.",

We performed a meta-analysis to identify common clinical features in NSCLC patients carrying BRAF mutations.We identified clinical studies that examined the association between BRAF mutations and features of NSCLC within PubMed, Embase and ISI Science Citation Index database up to October 2013. The effect size of clinical features was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study, using a fixed-effects or random-effects model.Ten studies with a total of 5599 NSCLC patients were included. There was a 3% (170/5599) BRAF mutation rate. BRAF mutations in NSCLC were significantly associated with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) (compared with non-ADCs, OR\u200a=\u200a4.96, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a2.29-10.75). There were no significant differences in gender, smoking and stage in patients with and without BRAF mutations.

In the current study, a novel version of allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR), termed competitive real-time fluorescent AS-PCR (CRAS-PCR) was developed to analyze the TPMT*2 genotype in ethnic Chinese. This technique simultaneously uses wild-type and mutant allele-specific scorpion primers in a single reaction. To determine the optimal conditions for both traditional AS-PCR and CRAS-PCR, we used the Taguchi method, an engineering optimization process that balances the concentrations of all components using an orthogonal array rather than a factorial array. Instead of running up to 264 experiments with the conventional factorial method, the Taguchi method achieved the same optimization using only 16 experiments. The optimized CRAS-PCR system completely avoided non-specific amplification occurring in traditional AS-PCR and could be performed at much more relaxed reaction conditions at 1% sensitivity, similar to traditional AS-PCR. TPMT*2 genotyping of 240 clinical samples was consistent with published data. In conclusion, CRAS-PCR is a novel and robust genotyping method, and the Taguchi method is an effective tool for the optimization of molecular analysis techniques.",

In this study, a surface plasmon resonance DNA biosensor based on RCA with a gold (Au) nanoparticle surface was established for isothermal identification of DNA. The probes included a specific padlock probe, a capture probe (CP), which is bound to biotin, and an Au nanoparticle-modified probe, which hybridizes with the RCA products. The CP was assembled on gold nanoparticles to increase its ability to bind and hybridize. The linear padlock probe, which was designed to circularize by ligation upon recognition of the bacterial pathogen-specific sequence in 16S rDNA, hybridizes to fully complementary sequences within the CP. Upon recognition, each target gene DNA is distinguished by localization onto the corresponding channel on the chip surface. Then, the immobilized CPs act as primers to begin the in situ solid-phase RCA reaction, which produces long single-stranded DNA. The RCA products fixed on the chip surface cause significant surface plasmon resonance angle changes. We demonstrated that six different bacterial pathogens can be identified simultaneously and that 0.5 pM of synthetic oligonucleotides and 0.5 pg \u03bcl(-1) of genomic DNA from clinical samples can be detected by this method with low background signals. Therefore, the multiplex diagnostic method provides a highly sensitive and specific approach for the rapid identification of positive samples.",

        "abstract": "The response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is variable because of intra-tumor heterogeneity at the genetic level, and consequently, it is important to develop sensitive and selective assays to predict patient responses to therapy. Low-abundance BRAF V600E mutations are associated with poor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors. We developed a method for the detection of BRAF V600E mutations in mCRC using real-time wild-type blocking PCR (WTB-PCR), in which a chimera composed of locked nucleic acids and DNA is incorporated to amplify the mutant allele at high efficiency while simultaneously inhibiting the amplification of wild-type alleles. Mixing experiments showed that this method is exquisitely sensitive, with detection of the mutated allele at a mutant/wild-type ratio of 1:10,000. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach for mCRC patients, we assessed the V600E mutations in 50 clinical cases of mCRC by real-time WTB-PCR. The percentage of patients with V600E mutation as determined by WTB-PCR (16\u00a0%, 8/50) was higher than by traditional PCR (10\u00a0%, 5/50), suggesting an increased sensitivity for WTB-PCR. By calculating the \u0394C q for real-time traditional PCR, which amplifies all BRAF alleles, versus WTB-PCR, which selectively amplifies mutant BRAF, we demonstrated that among the V600E-positive mCRC patient samples, the percentage of BRAF DNA with the V600E mutation ranged from 0.05 to 52.32\u00a0%. In conclusion, WTB-PCR provides a rapid, simple, and low-cost method to detect trace amounts of mutated BRAF V600E gene.",

        "abstract": "Ever since the emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the source of pharmaceutical heparin has been restricted to porcine intestinal mucosa. In this project, two real-time fluorescent PCR methods were developed to assist with quality control analysis. The first is a qualitative method which relies on SYBR Green I chemistry to confirm the porcine origin of industrial crude porcine heparin (ICPH), identify any ruminant contaminants, and generally control purity. The second is based on TaqMan chemistry and is able to quantitatively identify porcine, bovine, caprine, and ovine components and contaminants in ICPH. By targeting mitochondrial DNA, both PCR systems showed a detection limit of 1 pg DNA and amplification efficiencies ranging between 96% and 102%. Moreover, quantitative PCR showed a detection limit of 0.02 ppm in samples comprising porcine, bovine, caprine, and ovine DNA. The results of qualitative PCR over 27 ICPH samples showed that all samples were porcine in origin and that 17 had ruminant contaminants. The results of quantitative PCR further showed that out of all 17 samples with ruminant contaminants, seven samples had bovine, ovine, and caprine contaminants, two samples had bovine and ovine contaminants, and eight samples had only ovine contaminants. In conclusion, the qualitative PCR system was found to be a relatively inexpensive, rapid, and flexible method of identifying the porcine origin of and ruminant contaminants in ICPH, while the quantitative PCR was found suitable to accurately analyze the components and contaminants in detail. Both methods are suitable for routine control assays for the evaluation of ICPH purity and origins of contaminants.",

METHODS Faradaic impedance spectra measurements were performed as following: the bare electrode, after thiolated probe modification, after 6-mercaptohexanol modification, after the hybridization with target DNA and after the signal amplification with nanoparticles. In addition, the frequency shifts were also recorded. RESULTS The frequency shift caused by the conjugation of Au nanoparticles to target DNA (127.5\u00b16.8Hz) was significantly larger than that caused by the hybridization, the blank control and the negative control (P<0.01). The interfacial electron-transfer resistances significantly increased after each step (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS The EIS is proved to be a non-damage and useful technique for characterizing the multilayer films on the quartz crystal. The results well demonstrate the fabrication and detection process on the quartz crystal.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence points to a negative correlation between KRAS mutations and patients' responses to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment. Therefore, patients must undergo KRAS mutation detection to be eligible for treatment. High resolution melting analysis (HRM) is gaining increasing attention in KRAS mutation detection. However, its accuracy has not been systematically evaluated. We conducted a meta-analysis of published articles, involving 13 articles with 1,520 samples, to assess its diagnostic accuracy compared with DNA sequencing. The quality of included articles was assessed using the revised Quality Assessment for Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS-2) tools. Random effects models were applied to analyze the performance of pooled characteristics. The overall sensitivity and specificity of HRM were 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98-1.00) and 0.96 (95%CI: 0.94-0.97), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.996. High sensitivity and specificity, less labor, rapid turn-around and the closed-tube format of HRM make it an attractive choice for rapid detection of KRAS mutations in clinical practice. The burden of DNA sequencing can be reduced dramatically by the implementation of HRM, but positive results still need to be sequenced for diagnostic confirmation.",

        "abstract": "Objective To establish a rapid and sensitive method of color loop-mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP) for detecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa(P.aeruginosa).Methods LAMP method with hydroxy naphthol blue(HNB) and calcein was designed to amplify and identify the OprL gene of P.aeruginosa.Three pairs of LAMP primers(inner,outer and ring primers) were designed according to the eight zones of the OprL gene.A positive reaction was indicated by a color change before and after the reaction,and was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis.The reaction conditions and system were optimized.The sensitivity and specificity of the detection method were evaluated,and were compared with those of conventional PCR.Both LAMP and PCR were applied to detect clinical specimens.Results A LAMP method for detecting P.aeruginosa was successfully established.The LAMP method showed 100% specificity for P.aeruginosa without other bacteria amplification,and the sensitivity(with the minimum detection limit of 17.414 pg/\u03bcl) for the detection of P.aeruginosa was 10-fold higher than that of PCR(with the minimum detection limit of 174.14 pg/\u03bcl).The detection rates of LAMP and PCR in clinical specimens were the same(27/27).Conclusion LAMP method,in which the amplification can be completed within 60 min,is faster than PCR.The established LAMP method in this study enables rapid,sensitive and specific detection of P.aeruginosa,and can be applied for grass roots and small-scale laboratories as well as field surveillance.",

        "abstract": "CpG islands (CGIs) in human genomic DNA are GC-rich fragments whose aberrant methylation is associated with human disease development. In the current study, methylation-sensitive mirror orientation selection (MS-MOS) was developed to efficiently isolate and enrich unmethylated CGIs from human genomic DNA. The unmethylated CGIs prepared by the MS-MOS procedure subsequently were used to construct a CGI library. Then the sequence characteristics of cloned inserts of the library were analyzed by bioinformatics tools, and the methylation status of CGI clones was analyzed by HpaII PCR. The results showed that the MS-MOS method could be used to isolate up to 0.001% of differentially existed unmethylated DNA fragments in two complex genomic DNA. In the CGI library, 34.1% of clones had insert sequences satisfying the minimal criteria for CGIs. Excluding duplicates, 22.0% of the 80,000 clones were unique CGI clones, representing 60% of all the predicted CGIs (about 29,000) in human genomic DNA, and most or all of the CGI clones were unmethylated in human normal cell DNA based on the HpaII PCR analysis results of randomly selected CGI clones. In conclusion, MS-MOS was an efficient way to isolate and enrich human genomic CGIs. The method has powerful potential application in the comprehensive identification of aberrantly methylated CGIs associated with human tumorigenesis to improve understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms involved.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To construct a highly effective method to rapidly detect Staphylococcus epidermidis by nanoparticle amplification based piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance DNA sensor array. METHODS The specific oligonucleotide probe for S. epidermidis was immobilized on the gold surface of DNA sensor with self-assembly method firstly. The HRP and DAB solution was added to react with biotin-DNA complex after probe was hybridized with corresponding target DNA. Then, the frequency shift and reaction time were observed. In addition, we measured 35 clinical samples with both HRP-DAB amplification based piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance DNA sensor array and bacteria culture to assess the difference between the two methods. RESULTS The sensitivity of nanoparticle amplification based piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance DNA sensor array was 95.5%, the specificity was 84.6% and the Youden's index was 0.801.There was no difference between two methods (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The HRP-DAB amplification based QCM system we designed has the advantages of being rapid and highly sensitive and thus can be a useful supplement to clinical assay methods in rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria infections.",

        "abstract": "Learning object detection models from weakly labeled data is an important topic in computer vision. Among various types of weak annotations, image-level object labeling is a natural one that tells the existence, but not the precise locations, of object instances in images. Learning object detectors from image-level labels can be naturally cast as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. Existing MIL approaches for object detection still suffer from high false positive rates due to the lack of advanced instances selection techniques. In this study, a subspace-based generative model is proposed to select positive instances by minimizing rank of the coefficient matrix associated with the subspace models. An incoherence term between the subspace model and some 'hard' negative instances in then modeled by an -insensitive loss function. To further improve the discriminative ability, an ensemble strategy is proposed by employing multiple subspace models. Rigorous experiments are performed on several datasets, and the promising experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the state-of-the-art weakly supervised learning algorithms in terms of precision, recall, and F-score. \u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.",

Alternatively, we propose to select more discriminative instances for learning classifiers to further improve detection accuracy. With the candidate set of positive instances, we can also train a Smoothing Latent Support Vector Machine (SLSVM) to finally detect objects from a bag of instances. We observed that object instances of a common category are visually similar and when characterized as highdimensional feature representations, they approximately lie in a low-dimensional subspace. Therefore, we propose a formulation optimizes a labeling variable for each positive image and learns the subspace model by minimizing rank (via convex surrogate function) of the coefficient matrix associated with the subspace model. To improve discriminative power, we also promote incoherence between the subspace model and some \"hard\" negative instances by utilizing a \u03f5-insensitive loss. For this non-convex problem, we resort to block coordinate descent and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM) to get local optimal solutions. The promising empirical studies on real data sets demonstrate that our proposed method is superior to the stateof-the-art weakly supervised object detection approaches. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.",

From 0.0\u00b0 to 60.0\u00b0 in declination (Dec) range, no new TeV \u03b3-ray point sources with sufficiently high significance were identified while the well-known Crab Nebula and Mrk421 remain to be the brightest TeV \u03b3-ray sources within the field of view of the Tibet air shower array. Based on the currently available data and at the 90% confidence level (C.L.), the flux upper limits for different power law index assumption are re-derived, which are approximately improved by 1.7 times as compared with our previous reported limits.",

        "abstract": "The high degree of intra-tumor heterogeneity has meant that it is important to develop sensitive and selective assays to detect low-abundance KRAS mutations in metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients. As a major potential source of tumor DNA in the aforementioned genotyping assays, it was necessary to conduct an analysis on both the quality and quantity of DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE). Therefore, four commercial FFPE DNA extraction kits were initially compared with respect to their ability to facilitate extraction of amplifiable DNA. The results showed that TrimGen kits showed the greatest performance in relation to the quality and quantity of extracted FFPE DNA solutions. Using DNA extracted by TrimGen kits as a template for tumor genotyping, a real-time wild-type blocking PCR (WTB-PCR) assay was subsequently developed to detect the aforementioned KRAS mutations in mCRC patients. The results showed that WTB-PCR facilitated the detection of mutated alleles at a ratio of 1:10,000 (i.e. 0.01%) wild-type alleles. When the assay was subsequently used to test 49 mCRC patients, the results showed that the mutation detection levels of the WTB-PCR assay (61.8%; 30/49) were significantly higher than that of traditional PCR (38.8%; 19/49). Following the use of the real-time WTB-PCR assay, the \u0394Cq method was used to quantitatively analyze the mutation levels associated with KRAS in each FFPE sample. The results showed that the mutant levels ranged from 53.74 to 0.12% in the patients analyzed. In conclusion, the current real-time WTB-PCR is a rapid, simple, and low-cost method that permits the detection of trace amounts of the mutated KRAS gene.",

        "abstract": "Although traditional allele-specific PCR (tAS-PCR) is a common screening method for BRAF V600E mutations, its lower amplification specificity and mutation selectivity have limited its clinical applications. We hypothesize that these limitations are associated with the weaker specificities of allele-specific primers and the thermodynamic driving forces of DNA polymerase. We used three strategies to circumvent these limitations, namely, modifying allele-specific primers, introducing a competitive external allele-specific controller (i.e., cAS-PCR), and introducing a referenced internal positive controller in the cAS-PCR (i.e., rcAS-PCR). The amplification sensitivities and specificities were influenced by the position of the artificially introduced mismatched nucleotide in the allele-specific primers. Moreover, both cAS-PCR and rcAS-PCR could detect single-copy BRAF V600E alleles with higher mutation selectivity (0.1%) than tAS-PCR. In addition, cAS-PCR eliminated false-negative results caused by various PCR inhibitors that might be present in the DNA solutions. The rcAS-PCR could also be employed to avoid the false-negative results caused by low-abundance input templates in cAS-PCR. In conclusion, rcAS-PCR provides a rapid, simple, and low-cost method for detecting low levels of the mutated BRAF V600E gene.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are currently considered as potential biomarkers for various human diseases. In the present study, miRNA-triggered real-time fluorescent isothermal reaction with exponential amplification (ReFIRE) with or without Thermus aquaticus MutS (Taq MutS) was developed to analyze miRNAs using DNA polymerase, a nicking endonuclease, and fluorescently labeled primers. In the absence of Taq MutS, the ReFIRE system permitted the detection of 100\u00a0ymol of targeted miRNA in 80\u00a0min. However, this system enabled limited differentiation between homologous miRNA family members. Upon addition of Taq MutS to the ReFIRE system, non-specific amplification generated from the mishybridization between primers and primer dimers or primers and the template duplex was eliminated. The addition of Taq MutS enabled the ultrasensitive detection of as little as 10\u00a0ymol of targeted miRNAs in 50\u00a0min, which corresponds to less than 10 copies of miRNAs in a total volume of 20\u00a0\u03bcl. Additionally, the assay exhibited a dynamic range of up to 12 orders of magnitude. The ReFIRE system also showed high specificity, enabling differentiation between homologous miRNA family members exhibiting only single-base differences. The sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range associated with this system were greater than most currently available miRNA isothermal amplification assays. Moreover, when target-specific primers were labeled with different fluorescent reporters, multiplex analysis was easily performed in a single tube, permitting accurate normalization of miRNA expression. This simple, fast, ultrasensitive, highly specific, and easy-to-multiplex method could significantly contribute to research investigations pertaining to the biological roles of miRNA, as well as clinical diagnosis of various diseases that involve miRNA disruptions.

        "abstract": "Detection of EGFR mutations in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is beneficial to monitor the therapeutic effect, tumor progression, and drug resistance in real time. However, it requires that\u00a0the mutation detection method has the ability to quantify the mutation abundance accurately. Although the next-generation sequencing (NGS) and digital PCR showed high sensitivity for quantifying mutations in cfDNA, the use of expensive equipment and the high-cost hampered their applications in the\u00a0clinic. Herein, we propose a highly sensitive and specific real-time PCR by employing serial invasive reaction as a sequence identifier for quantifying EGFR mutation abundance in cfDNA (termed as qPCR-Invader). The mutation abundance can be quantified by using the difference of Ct values between mutant and wild-type targets without the need of making a standard curve.\u00a0The method can quantify a mutation level as lower as 0.1% (10 copies/tube). Thirty-six tissue samples from\u00a0non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were detected by our method and 14/36 tissues gave EGFR L858R mutation-positive results, whereas ARMS-PCR just identified 12 of L858R mutant samples. The two inconsistent samples were confirmed as L858R mutant by pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization method, indicating that qPCR-Invader is more sensitive than ARMS-PCR for mutation detection. The L858R mutation abundances of 19 cfDNA samples detected by qPCR-Invader were close to that from NGS, indicating our method can precisely quantify mutation abundance in cfDNA. The qPCR-Invader just needs a common real-time PCR device to accomplish quantification of EGFR mutations, and the fluorescence probes are universal for any target detection. Therefore, it could be used in most laboratories to analyze mutations in cfDNA. Graphical abstract \u115f.",

        "abstract": "It was hypothesized that in the WTB-PCR system, the greater number of cycles, associated with the thermodynamic driving force of DNA polymerase resulted in artificial introduction of mutant nucleotides in amplicons. In the current study, universal WTB-PCR was developed to overcome these limitations, in which two strategies were used: phosphorothioate modifications were made at the 5'-termini bases of the WTB oligonucleotides, and amplification of referenced internal positive controller (RIPC) fragments was performed. The results showed that universal WTB-PCR could detect single-copy KRAS mutant alleles with higher selectivity (i.e., 0.01%), and with greater ability to eliminate non-specific amplification of KRAS wild-type alleles in amounts up to 200\u202fng. Moreover, the introduction of referenced internal positive controller (RIPC) fragments prevented false-negative results caused by inadequate amounts of input sample DNA, and allowed for quantitative analysis of the mutation levels in each FFPE sample. In clinical application in 50 samples of FFPE tissue sections from mCRC patients, 70% (35/50) showed various mutations at codons 12 and 13 of KRAS genes; 30% (15/50) could be detected by traditional PCR without WTB oligonucleotides. In conclusion, universal WTB-PCR is a rapid, simple and low-cost method for detection of low-abundance KRAS mutations in mCRC patients.",

Our results revealed that small differences in water contents between bacterial cells account for distinct discrepancies of the absorption coefficients, which can be used for bacterial species identification. Furthermore, living and dead bacteria showed different absorption coefficients as a result of their different hydration levels, suggesting that THz spectroscopy can be used to rapidly assess the living state of bacteria under test. Our results clearly demonstrated the ability of THz spectroscopy for time-saving and label-free detection of bacteria with minimal sample preparation, potentially to be utilized for point-of-care tests in the near future.

        "abstract": "Warfarin is still the most clinically used oral anti-coagulant despite of its narrow therapeutic index and high risk of hemorrhage. The mean daily dose of warfarin varies widely from patient to patient, and to achieve the same therapeutic effect, the daily dose of warfarin could be varied over 20-fold. The variability in warfarin dosage depends on several factors, including gene polymorphisms, index of body mass, age and other drugs, and these factors compelled the clinicians to individualize warfarin dosage in order to optimize the therapeutic regimen. A number of genes are involved in metabolism of warfarin, such as cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2), gamma-glutamylcarboxylase (GGCX), etc. Of them CYP2C9 and VKORC1 are the emphasis of current researches. The association between the polymorphism of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 and individualized warfarin therapeutic regimen are mainly discussed in this paper.    DOI: 10.11855/j.issn.0577-7402.2015.02.16",

        "abstract": "Prospective testing for variants in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is considered a key process in the development of thiopurine therapy. This testing is done to avoid toxicity and side effects in the management of diverse immunological and malignant conditions. Real-time fluorescent PCR techniques using duplex-crossed allele-specific primers in a single tube (DCAS-PCR) were developed in this study to genotype the common loss-of-function TPMT*3B c.460G\u202f>\u202fA (rs1800460) and TPMT*3C c.719A\u202f>\u202fG (rs1142345) usually occurring in individuals of Chinese ethnicity. In this method, several integrated strategies were used to completely eliminate the non-specific amplification that is commonly presented in traditional allele-specific (AS) PCR. These strategies include using AS-primers (ASP) that both are artificially mismatched in the penultimate positions and phosphorothioate modifications in the 5'-termini positions. In the assay, an AS-blocker was used, locus-specific TaqMan (LST) probes were used and we used at least two fragments were simultaneously amplified in a single tube which satisfy the thermodynamic characteristics of DNA polymerase to eliminate non-specific amplification. In a group of 200 unselected subjects, the results showed that 8 samples were heterozygous of TPMT*3C, and all samples possessed wild-type TPMT*3B. There was no non-specific amplification, and the genotypes were 100% consistent with Sanger sequencing.",

        "abstract": "An inherited predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is exceedingly rare, but the investigation of these families will aid in the delineation of the underlying mechanisms of the more common, sporadic cases. Three AML predisposition genes, RUNX1, CEBPA and GATA2, have been recognised, but the culprit genes in the majority of AML pedigrees remain obscure. We applied a combined strategy of linkage analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology in an autosomal-dominant AML Chinese family with 11 cases in four generations. A genome-wide linkage scan using a 500K SNP genotyping array was conducted to identify a previously unreported candidate region on 20p13 with a maximum multipoint heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) score of 3.56 (P=0.00005). Targeted NGS within this region and whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed a missense mutation in TGM6 (RefSeq, NM_198994.2:c.1550T>G, p.(L517W)), which cosegregated with the phenotype in this family, and was absent in 530 healthy controls. The mutated amino acid was located in a highly conserved position, which may be deleterious and affect the activation of TGM6. Our results strongly support the candidacy of TGM6 as a novel familial AML-associated gene.",

Pulmonary vascular remodelling (PVR) induced by circulating mediators plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HPS, while the underlying mechanism remains undefined. In the present study, we reported that endothelin-1 (ET-1) is up-regulated and annexin A1(ANXA1) is down-regulated in HPS rat, and ET-1 decreases the ANXA1 expression in a dose-dependent manner in rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Then, we showed that ANXA1 can decrease nuclear p-ERK1/2 accumulation and decrease the cyclin D1 expression, thus resulting in the subsequent inhibition of PASMCs proliferation. As previously reported, we confirmed that ET-1 decreases the ANXA1 protein levels by the carbonylation and degradation of ANXA1. In conclusion, our research links the signaling cascade of ET1-ANXA1-cell proliferation to a potential therapeutic strategy for blocking IPS-associated PVR.",

However, the existing methods for detection of samples having rare mutations(i.e. ~0.01%) have limits in terms of specificity, time consumption or cost. In the current study, novel wild-type blocking (WTB) oligonucleotides modified with phosphorothioate or inverted dT at the 5'-termini were designed to precisely detect 11 common deletion mutations in exon 19 of EGFR gene (E19del) using a WTB-PCR assay. And internal competitive leptin amplifications were further applied to enhance the specificity of the WTB-PCR system. Our results showed that WTB-PCR could completely block amplification of wild-type EGFR when 200\u2009ng of DNA was used as template. Furthermore, the current WTB-PCR assay facilitated the detection of E19del mutations with a selectivity of 0.01% and sensitivity as low as a single copy. And, the results showed that the current WTB-PCR system exceeded detection limits afforded by the ARMS-PCR assay. In conclusion, the current WTB-PCR strategy represents a simple and cost-effective method to precisely detect various low-abundance deletion mutations.",

As an application, the complete group classification of a system of two component fractional evolution equations with an arbitrary function is performed. The admitted symmetries of all inequivalent systems belonging to the class under study are determined. What is more, all reduced fractional systems of ordinary differential equations and even explicit exact solutions are presented.",

It is shown that there are three, nine, forty-four and sixty-one inequivalent equations admitting one-, two-, three- and four-dimensional solvable Lie algebras, respectively. We also prove that there are no semisimple Lie group so(3) as the symmetry group of the equation, and only two realizations of sl(2, R) are admitted by the equation. The resulting invariant equations contain both the well-known equations and a variety of new ones.",

The prepared magnetic carbon aerogels (Mag-CA) materials were characterized by various methods, including BET surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). What's more, the Mag-CA materials were used as adsorbents to remove dyes [anionic methyl orange (MO) and cationic methylene blue (MB)] from aqueous solutions. The results showed that Mag-CA had an excellent adsorption performance towards MO and MB. The adsorption equilibrium data of both MO and MB can be well described by Langmuir model. The maximum MO and MB uptake capacity of Mag-CA reached 7.42mgg and 9.37mgg according to Langmuir isotherm at 303K, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters such as \u0394G, \u0394H and \u0394S were estimated to understand the adsorption mechanism of MO and MB. The adsorption processes of MO and MB could be well described by the pseudo-second-order model. Moreover, Mag-CA with dyes (MO or MB) were successfully regenerated by ethanol and then easily separated from aqueous solution by applying magnetic field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Konjac glucomannan (KGM) has been widely used in food industry, which is commonly extracted from  Amorphophallus rivirei . In this paper,  Amorphophallus guripingensis  was found to be another good resource of extracted KGM. The comparative studies, based on chemical composition analysis and rheological measurements, between those two different resources were investigated. Results showed that refined  A.\u00a0guripingensis  flour (AGF) contained 61.35% KGM, which was lower than that of refined ARF (72.80%). But, the viscosity-increased speed of AGF was faster than ARF. To be specific, even the viscosity of 3.5\u00a0wt% AGF solution was half of ARF, while they had similar viscosity values at a concentration of 4.5\u00a0wt%. Besides, viscosity change of the refined AGF with pH was more pronounced under strong acid condition. Meanwhile, thermo-gelling temperature of 4.0\u00a0wt% AGF solution was 85\u00a0\u00b0C, lower than that of ARF. These results demonstrated that AGF solutions were sensitive to processing factors, such as pH and temperature as compared to  A.\u00a0rivirei . Those properties endows AGF more valuable applications in food industry and it has great potential to be a pH-sensitive matrix.",

However, these properties limit its addition in food products, especially in drinks. The main aim of this study was to improve the functional properties of KGM by a green and effective method, that is phase separation. It was found that increasing temperature accelerated phase separation of KGM/gum arabic mixture. KGM-rich phase was characterised and its physical properties were investigated by different methods. Crystal property showed no significant changes after phase separation. Nevertheless, rheological properties indicated that the viscosities of samples after phase separation (FKGM) decreased dramatically. Their emulsifying capacities also improved. Moreover, the differences in molecular rearrangement at the oil\u2013water interface were also studied by using interfacial rheology. These results suggested that FKGM with low viscosity had better interfacial properties, and thus may have potential applications as food ingredients.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The spoilage and weight loss of meat products during storage always results in numerous problems for their commercialization and economic value. An edible thermo-reversible emulgel was prepared in this study, and its application in the preservation of meat products was investigated. The microstructure of the emulgel in liquid and solid forms was characterized. The decreased gel strength of the emulgel compared to the gelatin gel was likely due to the presence of the surfactant. The interaction between eugenol (Eu) and gelatin was mainly due to hydrophobic interactions and was weakened at 4\u202f\u00b0C. The results of the physicochemical and antibacterial experiments for the meat products showed that the emulgel effectively controlled the release of Eu on the meat surface; thus, it could significantly inhibit the growth of microorganisms and weight loss in meat, which prolonged the shelf-life of meat for more than 3 days. The transparent emulgel can be easily removed from meat by soaking in warm water (\u223c40\u202f\u00b0C), and it is a promising application for improving the safety and quality of meat products.",

The sensor consists of multimode fiber-photonic crystal fiber-multimode fiber (MMF-PCF-MMF) structure coated with gold film, whose refractive index (RI) sensitivity was found to range from 1060.78 nm/RIU to 4613.73 nm/RIU in the RI range of 1.3330-1.3904. Through simulation and experimental results, the RI sensitivity of the MMF-PCF-MMF structure is found to be higher than that of multimode fiber-single mode fiber-multimode fiber (MMF-SMF-MMF) structure. The sensing area was coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that has a high thermal coefficient, obtaining a high temperature sensitivity of -1.551 nm/\u00b0C in the temperature range of 35-100 \u00b0C, which means it has a broad application prospect in medical, environmental monitoring and manufacturing industry.",

The FP interferometer was fabricated by splicing the hollow capillary with a single-mode fiber and the end of the hollow capillary was filled with a layer of polyimide, achieving a humidity sensitivity of 22.07 pm/%RH in the range of 20\u201390 %RH. FBG is insensitive to humidity, which can be used to measure temperature and eliminate the obstruction of temperature on FP humidity probe by formula conversion. The temperature sensitivity of FBG is 9.98 pm/\u00b0C. Due to low cost and good stability, this system has broad application prospects in the fields of food processing, medical care, and food storage.",

        "abstract": "A novel fiber-optic refractive index (RI) and temperature sensor based on a multimode\u2013single-mode\u2013multimode fiber (MMF-SMF-MMF) structure coated with graphene\u2013metal hybrid films was proposed and investigated. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based RI sensitivity is improved by the addition of the graphene layer above or below the gold coating of the fiber and then further enhanced with the addition of gold\u2013silver core\u2013shell nanoparticles (Au@Ag NPs). Furthermore, the surface of graphene\u2013Au\u2013Au@Ag NPs film was modified with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for temperature sensing, achieving a high sensitivity of \u22121.02 nm/\u00b0C with good repeatability. This new structure with graphene\u2013gold\u2013Au@Ag NPs-PDMS hybrid films shows applications in many fields, including environmental protection, clean energy, and nano-medicine.",

The Fabry\u2013Perot resonant structure is consist of 11 porous thin films manufactured by electron beam physical vapor deposition. Since the films are porous material, the proposed fiber sensor structure is appropriate to detect the refractive index of liquid substances. In the refractive index detection experiments, the sensor probe possesses a refractive index sensitivity of 105 nm/RIU and a resolution of    2  \u00d7  10    \u22123  RIU. Cycling test results show that the prepared sensor probe has response time of 5 s and good repeatability.",

PABA was covalently conjugated to the primary C-6 hydroxyl group of \u03b2-cyclodextrin through ester linkage, and the preliminary release characteristics of PABA in rat gastrointestinal tract fluids were investigated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C within 24\u00a0h. In the fluids of stomach, the conjugates did hardly release PABA, and released PABA significantly up to 78.6\u00a0% in the fluids of intestine, respectively. These results indicate that the conjugate activation took place site-specifically in the rat intestinal fluids. Moreover, the drug release curves demonstrate that PABA could be gradually released in a long time with low initial burst release amount.",

Understanding the traditional soybean planting structure and dynamics in the main soybean producing areas is of great significance to China's soybean import and export trade and safeguarding national food security. With the Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images from 1996 to 2016, we extracted the spatial distribution information of soybean planting using random forest (RF) method based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques and analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of soybean planting structure in the Songnen Plain using landscape pattern index. The results showed that the soybean planting area in the Songnen Plain was fluctuating during 1996-2016. Among the area conversion with other land-use types, the interchanges between soybean and other crop lands were the most obvious. The proportion of soybean patch area to the total crop area increased first and then decreased, while the patch density index and the resolution index decreased first and then increased. In conclusion, the spatiotemporal evolution of the traditional soybean planting structure in the Songnen Plain showed the characteristics of fluctuation in planting area, increase in fragmentation, and discrete spatial distribution. The domestic and foreign markets as well as policy guidance were the important factors afecting the traditional soybean planting structure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The sown area of winter wheat in the Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) Plain accounts for over 65% of the total sown area of winter wheat in China. Thus, it is important to monitor the winter wheat growth condition and reveal the main factors that influence its dynamics. This study assessed the winter wheat growth condition based on remote sensing data, and investigated the correlations between different grades of winter wheat growth and major meteorological factors corresponding. First, winter wheat growth condition from sowing until maturity stage during 2011\u20132012 were assessed based on moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series dataset. Next, correlation analysis and geographical information system (GIS) spatial analysis methods were used to analyze the lag correlations between different grades of winter wheat growth in each phenophase and the meteorological factors that corresponded to the phenophases. The results showed that the winter wheat growth conditions varied over time and space in the study area. Irrespective of the grades of winter wheat growth, the correlation coefficients between the winter wheat growth condition and the cumulative precipitation were higher than zero lag (synchronous precipitation) and one lag (pre-phenophase precipitation) based on the average values of seven phenophases. This showed that the cumulative precipitation during the entire growing season had a greater effect on winter wheat growth than the synchronous precipitation and the pre-phenophase precipitation. The effects of temperature on winter wheat growth varied according to different grades of winter wheat growth based on the average values of seven phenophases. Winter wheat with a better-than-average growth condition had a stronger correlation with synchronous temperature, winter wheat with a normal growth condition had a stronger correlation with the cumulative temperature, and winter wheat with a worse-than-average growth condition had a stronger correlation with the pre-phenophase temperature. This study may facilitate a better understanding of the quantitative correlations between different grades of crop growth and meteorological factors, and the adjustment of field management measures to ensure a high crop yield.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTTo study the effects of aging time (the length of time when contaminants are sequestered in soil) and soil properties on TNT bioavailability in soil, earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to three types of soils (fluvo-aquic soil, loessal soil, and black soil) contaminated by TNT for 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42\u00a0days. The Earthworm-Soil Accumulation Factor (ESAF) of TNT and soil properties were analyzed. The ESAFs in black soil were significantly lower than those in fluvo-aquic soil and loessal soil (P u003c 0.05). In loessal soils, the ESAF increased with aging time, while that in black soils decreased. The ESAF of TNT had a significantly negative correlation with soil organic matter content, clay contents, and cation exchange capacity, which were the main factors affecting the TNT bioavailability in soils (P u003c 0.01). There was more quartz and feldspar in black soil, as well as more particles and micropores on the surface, which resulted in the easy adsorption and lower bioavailability of TNT. In con...",

        "abstract": "Fertilizers are widely applied in agricultural practice to improve crop yield and quality. However, they can also alter the behavior of soil pollutants. A field experiment was conducted on chernozem soil in Heilongjiang Province, China. Various proportions of inorganic nitrogen (N), phosphor (P) and organic fertilizers were applied in the plot. Soil samples were collected at four time points over two years, and the concentrations and speciation of chromium (Cr) and cadmium (Cd) were analyzed. Inorganic fertilizers addition had little effect on the concentrations of Cr or Cd, while organic fertilizer addition reduced the concentrations of both Cr and Cd. Inorganic fertilizers increased the concentration of Cr in the exchangeable form, while decreased the one of its residual form (P u003c 0.05). Addition of inorganic or organic fertilizer alone decreased concentrations of exchangeable Cd (P u003c 0.05), but the combination had the opposite effect. According to National Standard of the Peopleu0027s Republic of China (GB), high concentrations of Cd in plots could result in an environmental risk, and fertilizer application could lower that risk. Risk Assessment Code showed that risks resulting from the metals were lowered when organic fertilizer was applied alone (1350.0 g m\u22122) or in combination with inorganic fertilizers (8.2 g m\u22122 for N fertilizer, 3.0 g m\u22122 for P fertilizer, 3.7 g m\u22122 for K fertilizer and 675.0 g m\u22122 for organic fertilizer). In conclusion, when practicing agriculture in chernozem soil, organic fertilizer should be applied alone or with inorganic fertilizers to lower the environmental risks of Cr and Cd pollution.",

        "abstract": "Cobalt (Co) is a nutrient for soil microorganisms and crops, as well as a worldwide industrial pollutant. When the level of Co exceeds the acceptable limit, this heavy metal can lead to devastating consequences for soil environments. There is considerable attention and concern about elevated levels of Co contaminating soil and crops. Spent mushroom substrate (SMS) is a potential amendment for the adsorption of pollutants, which has potential for resolving Co-polluted soil that spans the world. To investigate the environmental behavior and risks associated with Co in fluvo-aquic soil under specific treatments of SMS from Pleurotus ostreatus, a lab-scale pot experiment was conducted. SMS and exogenous Co were added to soil, which was retained for approximately 30\u00a0days. Pakchois (Brassica chinensis L.) were planted in the treated soil for 28\u00a0days until harvest. The Co speciation in soil (modified BCR sequential extraction) and Co accumulation in pakchoi tissue were studied. When the SMS concentration was within a range of 0 to 9\u00a0g\u00a0kg (total amount\u2009=\u20090 to 2.7\u00a0g), Co in the acid-soluble fraction was transformed to the oxidizable fraction in soil, resulting from the mesh structure on the surface of SMS, as well as the amide and carboxyl in the SMS molecular structure. In this situation, the Co accumulation levels in the pakchois decreased significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05), indicating the efficacy of SMS for reducing Co phytoavailability. However, when the SMS concentration reached 12\u00a0g\u00a0kg, the phytoavailability increased again (P\u2009<\u20090.05). When the SMS concentration ranged from 8.86 to 9.51\u00a0g\u00a0kg, the Co phytoavailability in soil reached a minimum, while the biomass of pakchoi reached a maximum. Conclusively, SMS from Pleurotus ostreatus are effective for reducing the Co phytoavailability, as well as for reducing the chance of Co transferring into a human's body through crops (i.e., food consumption). In order to achieve the optimum efficacy, the SMS concentration in soil should be maintained at a range of 8.86 to 9.51\u00a0g\u00a0kg.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the efficacy of humic acid and cow dung for nickel (Ni) immobilisation and detoxification in fluvo-aquic soil, the Ni-polluted soil was mixed with amendments of humic acid and cow dung. The Ni speciation (modified BCR sequential extraction method) and enzyme activities were scrutinised. As the humic acid concentration increased (0 to 12\u2009g\u2009kg\u20131), the amount of Ni in the acetic acid-soluble fraction (the bioavailable fraction with high environmental risk) first decreased and then increased. In contrast, the amount of Ni in this fraction continued to decrease as the cow dung concentration increased (P\u2009u003c\u20090.05). The Ni in the acetic acid-soluble and residual fractions transformed to the oxidisable fraction, leading to lower environmental risk. The fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis and alkaline phosphatase activity were negatively correlated with the amount of Ni in the acetic acid-soluble fraction (r\u2009=\u2009\u20130.695 and \u20130.773, respectively, P\u2009u003c\u20090.01), indicating that Ni in the acetic acid-soluble fraction was toxic and led to enzyme activity inhibition, and the amendments could reduce subsequent damage. When humic acid concentration ranged from 5.01 to 6.47\u2009g\u2009kg\u20131, the acetic acid-soluble Ni level reached the minimum, while the fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis and the alkaline phosphatase activity reached their maxima. In conclusion, humic acid and cow dung are effective amendments for Ni immobilisation and reduce devastation of soil enzymes. The humic acid concentration should be between 5.01 and 6.47\u2009g\u2009kg\u20131 to achieve the optimum efficacy.",

        "abstract": "AIM: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been practiced in China for thousands of years, providing a unique theoretical and practical approach to the treatment of diseases. In TCM theory, the notions of the \"whole\" and the use of \"system\" rather than isolation are important concepts, which well fit to systems biology theory. In the present study, we try to discover whether GC/MS-based metabolomics approaches contribute to differentiate the TCM syndrome types of hypertension. METHODS: The three phenotypes of constitution in patients with essential hypertension, the hyperactivity of liver yang type, tan shi yong sheng type and yin xu yang kang type, were classified by TCM approach. Serum metabolomic profiles for healthy persons and hypertension patients were acquired using GC/MS global analysis. Principal components analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and Mahlanobis distance (MD) were applied to facilitate the metabolomics data differentiation and prediction. RESULTS: Using PCA and PLS-DA, it was capable of distinguishing normal blood pressure serum samples from those of the TCM syndrome types, while failed to discriminate the three TCM syndrome types of hypertension from each other. Further MD analysis contributed not only to a fine differentiation, but also to a clear exhibition of the progression, of the three syndrome types. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that the metabolomics approach might be a powerful tool for exploring the scientific essence of the TCM theory.",

Based on the cyclic voltammetry scans and volt-ampere relation analysis, in direct oxidation, the oxygen evolution from H2O2 decomposition was completely inhibited, and more \u2022OH radicals could be then generated over PbO2/TiO2 and in the presence of powder activated carbon (PAC). PbO2/TiO2 can be indicated as an appropriate for the direct electrooxidation of ammonia in an unpacked bed reactor. While the efficiency for direct oxidation of ammonia was similar for the three anodes in a PAC packed reactor due to the presence of PAC could avoid short circuit and enhance electric efficiency. In indirect oxidation mediated by active free chlorine, Rh-Ir/TiO2 was the most effective in ammonia removal when chloride was present in the reaction system, and the disappeared ammonia was mainly transferred to N2, and only a small part was converted into nitrate (there was no nitrite detected during the reaction). The results indicated that Rh-Ir/TiO2 had the highest oxidation capability for ammonia compared with Ta-Ir/TiO2 and PbO2/TiO2. Hence, Rh-Ir/TiO2 based on a PAC packed bed reactor provides an alternative for the treatment of ammonia wastewater with high chloride concentration.",

The contribution of indirect oxidation caused by active free chlorine to ammonia removal increased with the increase of chloride concentration. Moreover, the effects of inlet velocity, salinity, and current density on ammonia removal were also investigated in detail. On the basis of the CV scan and COD removal results, both direct and indirect oxidations were involved in ammonia removal. The results indicated that ammonia removal by direct oxidation occurs at a slower rate than that of COD, while indirect oxidation prefers removal of ammonia than that of COD.

        "abstract": "The scientific measurement of land use in space is an essential task in urban agglomeration studies, and the fractal feature is one of the most powerful tools for describing the phenomenon of space. However, previous research on the fractal feature of land use has mostly been conducted in urban space, and examines the fractal feature of different land use types, respectively; thus, the measurement of the relationship between different land use types was not realized. Meanwhile, previous prediction methods used for spatial land use mostly relied on subjective abstraction of the evolution, theoretically, regardless of whether they were calibrated, so that complete coverage of all the mechanisms could not be guaranteed. Based on this, here, we treat the land use structure in urban agglomeration space as the research object, and attempt to establish a fractal measure method for the relationship between different land use types in the space of urban agglomeration. At the same time, we use the allometric relationship between \u201centirety\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d to establish an objective forecast model for the land use structure in urban agglomeration space based on gray prediction theory, to achieve a predictive measurement of the structure of land use in urban agglomeration space. Finally, this study applied the methods on the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei urban agglomeration to analyze the evolution of the stability of the structure of land use and achieve predictive measurement of the structure of land use. The results of the case study show that the methods proposed in this study can obtain the measurement of the relationship between different land use types and the land use prediction that does not depend on the subjective exploration of the evolution law. Compared with the measurement methods that analyzed the fractal feature of different land types, respectively, and the prediction methods that rely on subjective choice, the methods presented in this study recaps some innovations and reference values for relevant future research.",

The available methods for urban metabolism are all approaches that consider an urban system to be a \u201cblack box\u201d, accounting the input and output flows of energy and material, but lacking an analysis of internal elements and the metabolic processes. This study introduced a system dynamics model to study the stocks, flows, activities, and drivers within an urban system, and developed a double-layer model to implement metabolic modeling at two spatial scales. The system dynamics model is built from the perspective of demand-driven to simulate the input of different resources and materials in the urban metabolism. Emergy analysis was used to calculate the value of variables and evaluate metabolic status. A detailed case study for Jing-Jin-Ji agglomeration of China is used to validate the model and identify major drivers. Results show that the system dynamics approach is suitable for the research of urban metabolism. In future work, more metabolic details should be developed in the model to reduce the impact of data limitations, and more component drivers that affect urban metabolism and relationships within the system should be considered.",

        "abstract": "In this cohort of CIU patients who were newly prescribed omalizumab, the majority were treated by allergists/immunologists as expected, and approximately 60% of patients continued on therapy beyond 18 months. Concomitant medication use decreased after omalizumab initiation. These data on the real-world use of omalizumab for CIU may help to better inform decision-making processes for health care payers by quantifying omalizumab and concomitant medication treatment patterns over a longer time frame relative to previous studies. DISCLOSURES This study was sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, which provided funding support for the conduct of the study. Kavati, Ortiz, and Paknis are employees of Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Ke, Wertz, Huang, Wang, Willey, and Stephenson are employees of HealthCore, an independent research organization that received funding from Novartis Pharmaceuticals for the conduct of this study. Beck is an employee of the University of Rochester Medical Center, who was under contract with Novartis Pharmaceuticals to provide consulting services to this study, and reports grants from Genentech, outside the currently submitted work. Bernstein is affiliated with Bernstein Clinical Research Center, which was under contract with Novartis Pharmaceuticals to provide consulting services to this study, and reports receiving grants and personal fees from Novartis Pharmaceuticals, grants and personal fees from Genentech outside of the submitted work, and is an author on the Joint Task Force for Practice Parameters for Urticaria and the GALEN international guidelines for urticaria under preparation. Study concept and design were primarily contributed by Kavati, Ortiz, and Paknis, with assistance from the other authors. Huang, Wang, and Ke took the lead in data collection, with assistance from Wertz, Willey, and Stephenson. Data interpretation was performed by Ke, Wertz, and Willey, assisted by the other authors. The manuscript was written by Stephenson, Ke, and Wang, along with Willey, Wertz, and Huang, and revised by Bernstein and Beck, with assistance from the other authors. Selected study data were presented in a poster at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) 22nd Annual International Meeting on May 20-24, 2017, in Boston, Massachusetts. A poster based on this dataset was presented at the 2017 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting on October 26-30, 2017, in Boston, Massachusetts.",

Treatments with BC or FMBC improved the dry weights of rice roots, stems, leaves, and grains in soils containing different As contamination levels. Compared to BC treatment, FMBC treatments significantly reduced As accumulation in different parts of the rice plants (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and FMBC performed better than FMBC did. Furthermore, exposure to 2% FMBC decreased the total As concentration in the grain by 68.9-78.3%. The addition of FMBC increased the ratio of essential amino acids in the grain, decreased As availability in the soil, and significantly increased the Fe and Mn plaque contents. The reduced As accumulation in rice can be attributed to As(III) to As(V) oxidation by ferro - manganese binary oxide, which increased the As adsorbed by FMBC. Furthermore, Fe and Mn plaques on the rice root surface decreased the transport of As in rice. Taken together, our results demonstrated the applicability of FMBC as a potential measure for reducing As accumulation in rice, improving the amino acid content of rice grains, and effectively remediating As-polluted soil.",

We reveal that maximum volatilization is achieved in the fourth week and is followed by stabilization. The extent of volatilization decreased in the order of control\u202f>\u202fnano-zerovalent iron >40-nm hydroxyapatite\u202f>\u202fnano-FeO\u202f>\u202f20-nm hydroxyapatite\u202f>\u202fmultilayer graphene oxide\u202f>\u202fhigh-quality graphene oxide. The most abundant forms of As in soil corresponded to As-Fe and Al oxides. In soil with low levels of As pollution, the contents of these species increased after treatment with graphene oxides but decreased after treatment with other nanomaterials, with an opposite trend observed for soil with high levels of As pollution. The addition of nanomaterials influenced the activity of soil enzymes, e.g., hydroxyapatites affected the activities of urease and alkaline phosphatase, whereas graphene oxides significantly impacted that of peroxidase (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The addition of nanomaterials (which can potentially inhibit microbial growth) affected As levels by influencing the amount of As volatilized from polluted soil. Moreover, As volatilization, enzyme activity, and As speciation were observed to be mutually correlated (e.g., volatilization was negatively correlated to peroxidase activity and the contents of amorphous crystalline hydrous oxides of As-Fe and Al).",

Hydroponic experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of different nanomaterials (high-quality graphene oxide, multilayer graphene oxide, 20\u202fnm hydroxyapatite (HA), 40\u202fnm hydroxyapatite (HA), nano-FeO (nFeO) and nano-zerovalent iron [nFe]) on the biomass, arsenic uptake, and enzyme activities in seedlings of the rice cultivars T705 and X24. Compared with the control, the addition of different nanomaterials increased seedling growth, with X24 rice growing better than T705 rice. Nanomaterials effectively reduced arsenic uptake in T705 rice seedlings under low and high arsenic concentrations; however, they were only effective at lower arsenic concentrations in X24 seedlings. nFeO and nFe performed better than other nanomaterials in preventing arsenic from being transported to the aboveground parts of the rice seedlings. Different nanomaterials obviously influenced enzyme activities in the T705 seedlings at low arsenic concentrations (\u2264 0.8\u202fmg\u202fL). High-quality and multilayer graphene oxide decreased enzyme activities in the aboveground parts of the T705 seedlings, whereas, HA and HA increased the enzyme activities. nFeO and nFe also reduced the effect of antioxidants in the aboveground parts of the T705 seedlings. Nanomaterials effectively reduced the arsenic uptake of T705 and X24 rice seedlings at low arsenic concentrations.",

        "abstract": "Delivery of imaging agents to brain glioma is challenging because the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) functions as a physiological checkpoint guarding the central nervous system from circulating large molecules. Moreover, the ability of existing probes to target glioma has been insufficient and needs to be improved. In present study, PEG-based long circulation, CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs)-based nanoscale and fluorescence, asparagines-glycine-arginine peptides (NGR)-based specific CD13 recognition were integrated to design and synthesize a novel nanoprobe by conjugating biotinylated NGR peptides to avidin-PEG-coated QDs. Our data showed that the NGR-PEG-QDs were nanoscale with less than 100 nm and were stable in various pH (4.0 ~ 8.0). These nanomaterials with non-toxic concentrations could cross the BBB and target CD13-overexpressing glioma and tumor vasculature in vitro and in vivo, contributing to fluorescence imaging of this brain malignancy. These achievements allowed groundbreaking technological advances in targeted fluorescence imaging for the diagnosis and surgical removal of glioma, facilitating potential transformation toward clinical nanomedicine.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with systematic administration of microbubbles (MBs) can open the blood brain barrier (BBB) locally, transiently and reversibly. However, because of the micro size diameters, MBs are restricted in the intravascular space and cannot extravasate into diseased sites through the opened BBB. In this study, we fabricated one kind of nanoscale droplets which consisted of encapsulated liquid perfluoropentane cores and poly (ethyleneglycol) - poly (lactide-co-glycolic acid) shells. The nanodroplets had the capacity to realize liquid to gas phase shift under FUS. Significant extravasation of Evan's blue appeared when acoustic pressure reached 1.0 MPa. Intracerebral hemorrhages and erythrocyte extravasations were observed when the pressure was increased to 1.5 MPa. Prolonged sonication duration could enhance the level of BBB opening and broaden the time window simultaneously. Furthermore, compared with MBs, the distribution of EB extravasation was firmly confined within narrow region in the center of focal zone, suggesting the site of FUS induced BBB opening could be controlled with high precision by this procedure. Our results show the feasibility of serving PEGylated PLGA-based phase shift nanodroplet as an effective alternative mediating agent for FUS induced BBB opening.",

Considering the changes over the past three decades, little is known about the current epidemiological characteristics of stroke in Hunan Province. In 2013, a cross-sectional study was conducted at seven national disease surveillance points (DSPs) in Hunan Province. A multistage cluster sampling method was used to select a representative sample. A total of 21,156 participants aged 20 years and older were examined. Among the 21,156 participants, the number of prevalent strokes, incident strokes and deaths was 307, 87, and 36, respectively. The 2010 China census-standardized prevalence, incidence and mortality were 1191.0 per 100,000 people [95% confidence interval (CI) 1044.8-1337.2], 333.6 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 255.7-411.5) and 129.7 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 81.1-178.3), respectively. Ischemic stroke (IS), ICH, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and stroke of undetermined type (UND) constituted 50.6, 41.4, 5.7, and 2.3% of all incident stroke cases, respectively. Tianxin, Liuyang, Wuling, and Hongjiang have high proportions of ICH (61.5, 58.3, 60, and 50%, respectively). Hypertension is the most common risk factor for prevalent stroke (71.34%), followed by smoking (30.62%) and alcohol use (25.73%). In conclusion, Hunan Province has an extremely heavy stroke burden. The high proportion of ICH is not limited to the Changsha community; it represents an important issue for all of Hunan Province.",

        "abstract": "Carotid plaque is an aggregate marker of exposure to vascular risk factors, which are linked to structural brain changes. We investigated prestroke global and regional changes in brain volume in a carotid plaque population of cognitively healthy individuals and the association between carotid plaque characteristics and these changes.A total of 76 participants were divided into healthy control (HC, n\u200a=\u200a28), vulnerable plaque (n\u200a=\u200a27) and stable plaque groups (n\u200a=\u200a21). All subjects underwent carotid ultrasound and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to examine differences in regional gray matter volumes (rGMVs) among the different groups.The plaque group had a significantly lower mean total cerebral brain volume (TCBV) than the HC group (P\u200a=\u200a.03). Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was negatively correlated with TCBV (r\u200a=\u200a-0.311, P\u200a=\u200a.006) and rGMV in the right thalamus (r\u200a=\u200a-0.589, P\u200a=\u200a.001). The rGMVs of the right middle occipital gyrus and bilateral lingual gyrus were significantly different between the unstable and stable groups. The gray-scale median (GSM) of the plaque and the total plaque risk score (TPRS) were correlated with the volume of the right middle occipital gyrus (r=-0.478, P\u200a=\u200a.001; r\u200a=\u200a0.541, P\u200a=\u200a.001) and bilateral lingual gyrus (r\u200a=\u200a-0.419, P\u200a=\u200a.003; r\u200a=\u200a0.288, P\u200a=\u200a.04).Carotid plaque is related to the volume of the brain parenchyma and right thalamus. The rGMVs of the right middle occipital gyrus and bilateral lingual gyrus differed between the vulnerable plaque and stable plaque groups, and the characteristics of carotid plaques may serve as indexes that reflect these changes.",

        "abstract": "The present study examined the association between microRNA (miR)\u2011296 and angiogenesis following cerebral ischemic injury, and the underlying mechanisms. A cerebral ischemic model was established in rats via right middle cerebral artery occlusion. The animals were randomly divided into four groups (baseline, 1 day, 3 day and 7 day). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses were performed to examine the expression levels of miR\u2011296 and hepatocyte growth factor\u2011regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS), respectively. Angiogenesis was assessed by examining microvessel density. The results demonstrated that miR\u2011296 and angiogenesis were significantly upregulated, while HGS was significantly downregulated following ischemic injury. Adenovirus\u2011mediated overexpression of miR\u2011296 markedly enhanced the formation of capillary\u2011like structures in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, parallel with significantly increased expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2, and reduced expression levels of DLL4 and Notch1. The results of the present study provided in vivo and in vitro evidence suggesting that miR\u2011296 promotes angiogenesis in the ischemic brain through upregulating VEGF and downregulating Notch1 following cerebral ischemic injury.",

To mitigate multiuser interference at the base station with imperfect CSI, an iterative detector based on the Generalized Approximate Message Passing (GAMP) algorithm is developed. Compared to the classical massive MIMO OFDM system, our proposed scheme can improve energy efficiency (EE) without sacrificing spectral efficiency (SE).

There are conflicting reports of the Treg and Th17 frequency being increased, decreased, and unchanged as compared with controls. In this study, we sought to characterize the T-cell subsets including Treg function in both blood and marrow compartments of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM). The Treg/Th17 ratio is skewed toward the suppressive phenotype in MGUS and MM. There are more activated and memory Tregs in the myeloma marrow. Although the myeloma Tregs are functional, they are less suppressive than Tregs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia where they drive disease progression. None of the T-cell subsets were found to have a clinical correlation with time to progression in MGUS or progression-free survival in myeloma. Tregs are important but unlikely major players in the progression of MGUS to MM.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Increasing evidence shows that polymorphisms in a number of genes can influence age-related macular degeneration (AMD) risk. This study aimed to investigate the association of CX3CR1 839C/T, CX3CR1 745G/A, PLEKHA1 958A/G, VEGFA +674C/T, and VEGFA +936C/T polymorphisms with AMD risk among Chinese. MATERIAL AND METHODS The polymorphisms were genotyped on 827 AMD patients and 827 controls, and the odds ratios (ORs) were calculated under allele, additive, recessive, and dominant genetic models. Logistic regression analysis was performed to control for potential confounders (age, sex, and smoking status). RESULTS We showed that all the 5 polymorphisms showed a significant association with AMD risk under the additive model (for homozygous mutant genotype) and at least 1 other genetic model, both before and after adjustment for the potential confounders. PLEKHA1 958A/G polymorphism was associated with a decreased AMD risk (additive model: aOR=0.722, 95% CI=0.450-0.979, P=0.019; allele model: aOR=0.883, 95% CI=0.736-0.992, P=0.014), while all other polymorphisms were associated with an increased AMD risk (CX3CR1 839C/T, additive model: aOR=2.682, 95% CI=1.119-5.709, P=0.022, recessive model: aOR=2.729, 95% CI=1.141-6.048, P=0.010; CX3CR1 745G/A, additive model: aOR=2.614, 95% CI=1.231-6.012, P=0.020, recessive model: aOR=2.340, 95% CI=1.227-5.993, P=0.011; VEGFA +674C/T, additive model: aOR=1.601, 95% CI=1.253-2.179, P<0.001, dominant model: aOR=1.287, 95% CI=1.058-1.570, P<0.001, allele model: OR=1.220, 95% CI=1.118-1.427, P<0.001; VEGFA +936C/T, additive model: aOR=1.509, 95% CI=1.105-2.311, P<0.001, recessive model: aOR=1.432, 95% CI=1.027-2.192, P=0.009, dominant model: aOR=1.207, 95% CI=1.031-1.514, P0.001, allele model: aOR=1.216, 95% CI=1.062-1.408, P<0.001).

The conjugate in aqueous solutions was more stable at pH 1.2 and 4.4, and gradually hydrolyzed as a function of time at pH 6.8 and 7.4. According to the rate-pH profile, the half-lives of the conjugate at pH 1.2, 4.4, 6.8 and 7.4 were about 636, 576, 50 and 27 h respectively. In the contents of stomach, the conjugate did hardly release 5-FUAC, released 5-FUAC 19.3 % in the contents of small intestine, and released 5-FUAC significantly up to 62.7 % in the contents of colon. These results suggest that the secondary 5-FUAC/\u03b2-cyclodextrin conjugate may be of value as a colon-targeted and sustained-release prodrug.",

In aqueous buffer solutions at a pH of 1\u201310, the pH-rate profile for hydrolysis of the conjugate was interpreted in terms of spontaneous or water-catalyzed, and specific base-catalyzed reactions. In the solutions of \u03b1-amylase, the conjugate was degraded to 5-fluorouracil-1-acetic acid/small saccharide conjugates. In the solutions of carboxyl esterase, the conjugate was gradually hydrolyzed to 5-fluorouracil-1-acetic acid at the similar rate as that in the absence of the carboxyl esterase. 5-Fluorouracil-1-acetic acid was rapidly released when the conjugate was hydrolyzed firstly by \u03b1-amylase and secondly by carboxyl esterase. On the other hand, the rate of hydrolysis of the conjugate was accelerated significantly by the colonic fluids of rats. It is important to note that the secondary conjugate released the parent drugs more slowly than the primary one.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Little is known about epigenetic regulation of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Circular non-coding RNAs (circRNAs) play crucial roles in cardiovascular diseases, but they have received scant research attention regarding their relationship with IAs. This study aimed to explore new pathological mechanisms of IA through circRNA expression profiles and to provide novel therapeutic strategies. MATERIAL AND METHODS The comprehensive circRNA and mRNA expression profiles were detected by RNA-Seq in human IA walls and superficial temporal arteries (STAs). The RNA-Seq findings were validated by qRT-PCR. GO and KEGG analyses indicated the functions of these circRNAs. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed to reveal the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA relationship. Two newly discovered circRNAs were further detected in peripheral blood of IA patients and healthy people to clarify their expression patterns in the periphery. RESULTS Many differentially expressed circRNAs are closely involved in immune/inflammatory response and cell adhesion/adherens junction. The novel circRNAs (hsa_circ_0072309 and hsa_circ_0008433) regulate DDR2 and MMP2, respectively, which are associated with SMC dysfunction and vascular injury through ceRNA. Moreover, we found differential expression of these 2 circRNAs in the peripheral blood of IA patients, and the expression pattern of hsa_circ_0072309 had central and peripheral consistency. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform circRNA sequencing analysis of IAs. hsa_circ_0072309 and hsa_circ_0008433 are novel and pivotal circRNAs related to IAs. This study provides new insights into therapeutic targets and biomarkers for IA patients.",

        "abstract": "This study reports atomic-scale characterization of structural defects in YbTiO a pyrochlore oxide whose subtle magnetic interactions is prone to small perturbations. Due to discrepancies in the reported magnetic ground states, it has become a pressing issue to determine the nature of defects in this system. In the present study, we use atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques to identify the type of defects in the ytterbium titanate single crystals grown by the conventional optical floating zone (FZ) method. In addition to the known point defects of substitution Yb on Ti B-sites, extended defects such as dissociated superdislocations and anti-phase boundaries were discovered for the first time in this material. Such defects were prevalently observed in the FZ grown single crystals (of a darker color), in contrast to the stoichiometric white polycrystalline powders or high quality colorless single crystals grown by the traveling solvent floating zone technique. The lattice strains from these extended defects result in distortions of Yb-tetrahedron. A change of Ti valance was not detected at the defects. Our findings provide new insights into understanding the nature of defects that are of great importance for the physical property studies of geometrically frustrated compounds. Furthermore, this work sheds light on the complicated core structure of superdislocations that have large Burgers vectors in oxides with complex unit cells.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we developed a novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor for the highly sensitive detection of erythromycin by functionalising graphene oxide (GO) with nickel tetra-amined phthalocyanine (NiTAPc) through covalent bonding, which resulted in the formation of NiTAPc-Gr. The fabricated sensor showed a higher PEC efficiency under blue light, exhibiting a peak wavelength of 456\u202fnm, as compared to that of the monomer. Further, the NiTAPc-Gr/indium tin oxide (ITO) sensor exhibited a photocurrent that was 50-fold higher than that for a GO/ITO sensor under the same conditions. Under optimal conditions, the NiTAPc-Gr PEC sensor showed a linear response for erythromycin concentrations ranging from 0.40 to 120.00\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fL, with the minimum limit for detection being 0.08\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fL. Thus, the NiTAPc-Gr sensor exhibited superior performance and excellent PEC characteristics, high stability, and good reproducibility with respect to the sensing of erythromycin. Moreover, it is convenient to use, fast, small, and cheap to produce. Hence, it should find wide use in the analysis of erythromycin in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "The composite of molybdenum carbides and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs\u2013Mo2C) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was developed to prepare an electrochemical sensor for the ultrasensitive detection of rifampicin. Solvothermal and annealing methods were used to synthesize the MWCNTs\u2013Mo2C composite. The morphology and size of the synthesized materials were characterized using a scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope. The MWCNTs\u2013Mo2C composite shows a large effective surface area and reveals high electron transfer rate, indicating its excellent electrocatalytic activity. Under optimal conditions, the modified electrode used to analyze rifampicin shows an excellent linear relationship between the peak current and the rifampicin concentration in the range from 0.5 to 74 \u03bcM. The limit of detection was 0.045 \u03bcM (S/N = 3). The sensor was successfully applied to actual drugs and human serum testing with satisfactory results.",

        "abstract": "Developing advanced anode materials with multi-electron reaction, adequate charge transport, and suppressed volume changes is highly desirable in lithium storage. Both polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are attractive candidates for anode materials because of strong multi-electron redox properties of the former and high surface areas and controllable porosities of the latter. However, the easy dissolution of POMs in an electrolyte and the intrinsically poor conductivity of MOFs result in inferior rate performance and cycling capacity. In this paper, we skillfully encapsulate ionic liquids (ILs) into polyoxometalate-based metal\u2013organic frameworks (POMOFs) to fabricate a series of ILs-functionalized POMOF crystals (denoted as POMs-ILs@MOFs), in which POMs are immobilized in MOF cages to avoid the leaching of POMs. Also, an enhanced conductivity is obtained by the modification of ILs. One of the POMs-ILs@MOFs crystals, PMo10V2-ILs@MIL-100, when used as the anode material, shows superior cycling stability and high rate capability, which is proven to be the best amongst those of all the reported MOF, POM, and POMOF crystal materials. The outstanding performances are attributed to the hybrid behavior of a battery and a supercapacitor, which results from the synergistic effects of ILs, POMs, and MOFs. Most importantly, we not only discover a series of new anode materials but also propose a new strategy to improve the conductivity of MOFs and POMOFs, which will guide the development of other electrode materials based on MOFs and POMOFs for lithium storage.",

Benefitting from the efficient synthetic approach, a high degree of controlled design can be attained for the first time in the synthesis of hierarchical catalysts P-NiMo 4 N 5 @Ni, in which different morphologies arrays on nickel foam (NF) were achieved via introducing polyoxometalates with the capability of controlling the nucleation and crystal growth. Especially, the optimized twist braid nitrides nanorod arrays electrode P-NiMo 4 N 5 @Ni-1 with high surface-to-volume ratio of energetic actives exhibited unprecedented activity as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting, approaching 50 and 100\u2009mA\u2009cm \u22122  at low cell voltages of 1.59 and 1.66\u2009V, respectively, which is one of the best electrolytic water catalysts. The insights gained through this work may provide novel approach for designing other arrays derived from polyoxometalates with unique surfaces as versatile electrode and provide a design platform to prepare the invertible oxides catalysts from nitrides at high potential with enhanced catalytic performance.",

Zn-e-Keggin fragments were directly connected with TPT ligands generating 2D layers and further interdigitated with each other by \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions to pack into a 3D array. The compound exhibited excellent stability in air and different organic solvents and even in different pH (pH 1\u201311) aqueous solutions. It can be utilized as an anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to the combination of the multi-electron redox property of POM units and the functionalization of MOFs. NNU-11 exhibited a highly reversible capacity of 750 mA h g\u22121 at a current density of 50 mA g\u22121 after 200 cycles along with excellent cycle stability and rate performance.

        "abstract": "To solve the problem that the traditional spectrum sensing can only obtain the limited information of primary user and the efficiency of spectrum usage is low, this paper proposes a spectrum situation scheme to obtain the interference distribution information of primary user in frequency and spatial domain. This scheme uses surface spline interpolation based on the information returned by a small amount of sensor nodes. On this basis, a new transmit power control mechanism based on location-awareness is proposed. This mechanism realizes the power control according to three kinds of position relations between primary user and secondary user. It can solve the concurrent communication interference problem. Simulation analysis shows that this mechanism can increase the capacity of cognitive network while maintaining a quality-of-service for primary user by limiting the interference generated by secondary user.",

        "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection is a significant contributor to dysregulated T cell-mediated immune response. Here we aimed to evaluate the mechanism of MTB infection in promoting interleukin-10 (IL-10) upregulation. The IL-10 levels in MTB infected THP-1\u00a0cells were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In challenged THP-1\u00a0cells, the HDAC6 and HDAC11 mRNA and protein levels were monitored at varied duration after MTB infection. Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was used to investigate the interaction between IL-10 expression and HDAC6 or HDAC11. HDAC6 and HDAC11 were overexpressed or silenced to study their effects on IL-10 regulation. IL-10 was upregulated after MTB challenge in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Similarly, HDAC6 and HDAC11 were also upregulated by MTB challenge. Overexpression or silencing of HDAC6 and HDAC11 changed IL-10 expression correspondingly. MTB infection disturbs the HDAC6/HDAC11 levels to induce IL-10 expression. Strategies to counteract the dysregulation of HDAC6/HDAC11 would potentially alleviate the immunological disordered following MTB infection.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-10 plays a key role in immune response following mycobacterial infection, which can be inhibited by histone deacetylase (HDAC) 6. In this study, we explored whether Tubastatin A, a HDAC6 inhibitor, could enhance immune response and restrain mycobacterial growth. We established a mouse model using attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tbH37Ra) infection. The growth of mycobacteria was evaluated using colony form unit assays. Immune response statues were investigated using flow cytometry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to study the influence of HDAC6 on IL10 transcription. Tubastatin A significantly inhibited the growth of M.tbH37Ra in the lungs of mice. In parallel, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-12p40 and interferon-\u03b3 were up-regulated, while the level of IL-10 was down-regulated. Tubastatin A accelerated the delayed innate cellular immune response by recruiting more macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils into the lungs. More antigen-bearing DCs and primed Th1 cells were observed in the draining lymph nodes in mice treated with Tubastatin A. Tubastatin A reduced HDCA6 recruitment on IL10 promoter. Tubastatin A enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses against the mycobacteria by suppressing IL-10 expression and consequently delayed mycobacterial growth. The experiments were extended to the H37Rv strain on the insistence of the Editor.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Background  Besides being the worldu0027s most widely used vaccine, BCG is the most controversial vaccine in current use. Estimates of protection impaired by BCG against pulmonary TB vary from nil to 80%. Dietary zinc deficiency has been confirmed to impair the immune function of animals. However, knowledge about effects of mild dietary zinc deficiency and the time of vaccination on BCG vaccine responsiveness in offspring and adult rats is limited. This work investigated the consequences of feeding zinc deficient and normal zinc diets to rats during gestation, infancy or adulthood on the immune responses to BCG vaccination.  Methods  On gestation day 0, sixteen maternal rats were divided into two groups and fed with diets bellow: a control diet ad libitum (30\u00a0\u03bcg zinc/g diet, NC), a zinc deficient diet ad libitum (8\u00a0\u03bcg zinc/g diet, ZnD). Pup rats were served as experimental subjects.  From day 1 of pregnancy upon delivery, maternal rats were given a standard diet (30\u00a0mg/kg/day zinc) or zinc deficient diet (8\u00a0mg/kg/day zinc) respectively. Adult male 10-week Wistar rats were divided into two dietary groups for 17 weeks of feeding: a control diet ad libitum (30\u00a0\u03bcg zinc/g diet, NC), a zinc deficient diet ad libitum (8\u00a0\u03bcg zinc/g diet, ZnD). The birth time of newborn pups was recorded as the zero week. For adult male rats, the time of receiving different assigned diet was recorded as the zeroth week. Newborn pups of these maternal rats were immunized with BCG vaccine or MTB antigen ESAT-6/CFP-10 at postnatal 0 and 2 week. The adult male rats were immunized on the 12th and 14th week. Then, blood samples, thymus and spleen from the rats were harvested for detection of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses using ELISA, MTT and QRT-PCR analysis. Decreased INF-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production in plasma, changes of expression level of ZIP2, ZIP8, NF-\u03baB and IL-6 mRNA in immune organs, together with reduced T cell proliferation was observed in pups and adult BCG rats suffered from dietary zinc deficiency. Small differences were observed between rats received BCG vaccine and MTB antigen ESAT-6/CFP-10.  Results  Our data clearly indicate that dietary zinc deficiency can weaken the plasma cytokine levels and cell-mediated responses to BCG and ESAT-6/CFP-10 vaccine via decreasing T cell proliferation, down-regulating INF-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production and affecting the expression of ZIP2, ZIP8, NF-\u03baB and IL-6 mRNA. In addition, the vaccine immunogenicity of BCG and ESAT-6/CFP-10 was not significantly affected by the time of vaccination.",
