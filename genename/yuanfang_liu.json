        "abstract": "Because of the possible health threat of nanodiamonds (NDs) to organisms, the pulmonary toxicity and translocation of NDs in different sizes in mice were investigated after intratracheal instillation administration. Biochemical assays, ultrastructural and histopathological evaluations of the lungs of the control and the ND exposed mice were carried out at 1, 7, 14 or 28 days post-exposure. Exposure to 1.0 mg/kg NDs with an average diameter of 4 nm produced a temporary lung index increase at 1 day post-exposure. NDs did not have evident adverse effects in the lungs within the studied period according to histopathological and ultrastructural investigations. Furthermore, no lipid peroxidation of the lung was observed. On the whole, intratracheally instilled NDs are of low pulmonary toxicity. In addition, the amount of NDs in alveolar decreased with time elapsed and the macrophages burdened with NDs were clearly observed in the bronchia from 1 day to 28 days post-exposure. Thus we affirm the critical role of alveolar macrophages in the main excretion pathway of NDs from the lungs, i.e. they engulf the NDs, migrate upward to the trachea by escalator/mucociliary system and finally enter the pharynx. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Fullerene derivatives have been reported as potential nanomedicines, however the role of surface chemical modification on the biological effects remains unclear. In this study, five kinds of water soluble C 60derivatives with different surface chemical modification, C 60-(OH) 20 (HFD), C 60-(\u03b2-Ala) 10.1 (AFD), C 60-(Lys) 8.7 (KFD), C 60-(Arg) 8.6 (RFD) and C 60-(NH(CH 2)2NH 2) 8.8 (NFD) were synthesized. Their cytotoxicity as well as TNF-\u03b1 secretions were evaluated in RAW264.7 macrophage cell line. The results show that no significant cytotoxicity can be observed upon 24 h exposure to C 60 derivatives at less than 50 \u03bcg/mL. However, higher concentration (>100 \u03bcg/mL) of these C 60 derivatives decreases the proliferation of RAW264.7. The cytotoxicity of these fullerene derivatives is probably through the apoptosis pathway, while the extent of cytotoxicity varies with the different surface charges. Higher celluar uptake of HFD was observed in RAW264.7 cells than AFD, which correlates with the more toxic effect of HFD over AFD. The secretion of cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) was determined to evaluate the immunostimulating activity of these fullerene derivatives. The data show that the fullerene derivatives with negative surface charges secrete more TNF-\u03b1, whereas derivatives with positive charges show insignificant effect. The possible influence of various surface charge property on the observed biological effects is discussed. Copyright \u00a9 2012 American Scientific Publishers.",

The improvement of the performance of traditional adsorbents would benefit the water decontamination. Herein, we reported that active carbon (AC) could be adopted as the precursor of carbon nano-adsorbent with improved performance. Oxidized carbon nanoparticles (O-CNPs) were prepared by oxidizing commercial AC with modified Hummers method. O-CNPs were in the range of 10-500 nm and enriched in oxygen containing groups. Due to the effective nanonization and oxidation, O-CNPs were good adsorbent of cationic dye, namely methylene blue (MB), with huge adsorption capacity of 4.73\u00d710 2 mg/g (carbon-equivalent). When the initial MB concentration was lower than 50 mg/L, the removal efficiency was higher than 99.9% and the MB solution became colorless. According to the capacity assessment, the adsorption capacity (carbon equivalent) of AC increased 58% after the nanonization. The implication to the applications of nanomaterials in water treatment is discussed. Copyright \u00a9 2012 American Scientific Publishers.",

In this study, we systematically evaluated the adsorption and desorption of doxorubicin (DOX) on oxidized multi-walled CNTs (O-MWCNTs). Our results indicated that O-MWCNTs possessed a huge adsorption capacity for DOX (9.45\u00d710(3) mg/g). Although the adsorption process was quite slow, the adsorption capacity kept high enough for the therapy while shortening the incubation time to 2h (1.03\u00d710(3) mg/g). The desorption of DOX from O-MWCNTs scarcely occurred while incubated in buffer solution at both pH 7.4 and pH 5.5, however, the lower pH did benefit the desorption. The presence of serum proteins facilitated the desorption of DOX significantly, because these proteins bound strongly to O-MWCNTs resulting in the partial surface of O-MWNCTs being occupied. Moreover, the adsorption time also affected the release of DOX from O-MWCNTs. Shortening the incubation time benefited the release of DOX. The implications to the drug loading and therapeutics of the CNT-based drug delivery systems are discussed.",

The process gives a product of >98% purity, which is acquired from a gram-scale dirty raw soot with an overall yield of \u223c75% of the SWCNTs. The purity of the samples was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Raman and Vis\u2013NIR spectroscopy, and magnetometry. A highly pure SWCNT sample with relative purity of 170.4% and I G / I D value of 78.92 is achieved. Experiments showed that HNO 3 /HCl refluxing combined with freeze-drying is the key process that renders the crude SWCNTs hydrophilic with a large surface area, and thus remarkably increases the efficiency of the steam treatment to remove most of the carbonaceous impurities.",

Understanding the basic biological consequence of ND is crucial for realizing its biorelevant applications and ascertaining its possible hazards to organisms. In this work, we found that NDs with a diameter of around 50\u00a0nm predominantly accumulated in liver after intravenous injection to mouse. Spleen and lung were also target organs for NDs. Analysis of the digested solution of liver and lung by spectroscopic method shows that about 60% of initial NDs were entrapped in liver at 0.5\u00a0h post dosing and 8% in lung. The values remained the same at 28\u00a0days post injection. The high-resolution transmission electron micrographic imaging and the Raman spectrum of the digested organ solutions confirmed the long-term entrapment of NDs in mouse liver and lung. The NDs were barely detectable in urine and feces by Raman measurement. Considering quite a number of NDs remain in the important organs, potential toxicity study is urgently needed.",

        "abstract": "Nanotechnology shows great potential for producing food with higher quality and better taste through including new additives, improving nutrient delivery, and using better packaging. However, lack of investigations on safety issues of nanofood has resulted in public fears. How to characterize engineered nanomaterials in food and assess the toxicity and health impact of nanofood remains a big challenge. Herein, a facile and highly reliable separation method of TiO2 particles from food products (focusing on sugar-coated chewing gum) is reported, and the first comprehensive characterization study on food nanoparticles by multiple qualitative and quantitative methods is provided. The detailed information on nanoparticles in gum includes chemical composition, morphology, size distribution, crystalline phase, particle and mass concentration, surface charge, and aggregation state. Surprisingly, the results show that the number of food products containing nano-TiO2 (<200 nm) is much larger than known, and consumers have already often been exposed to engineered nanoparticles in daily life. Over 93% of TiO2 in gum is nano-TiO2 , and it is unexpectedly easy to come out and be swallowed by a person who chews gum. Preliminary cytotoxicity assays show that the gum nano-TiO2 particles are relatively safe for gastrointestinal cells within 24 h even at a concentration of 200 \u03bcg mL(-1) . This comprehensive study demonstrates accurate physicochemical property, exposure, and cytotoxicity information on engineered nanoparticles in food, which is a prerequisite for the successful safety assessment of nanofood products.",

Compared with the control group, phagocytic activity of RES, activity of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde in splenic homogenate did not change significantly in 2 months.

It is important to know the basic process of interaction between NPs and cells in terms of cellular endocytosis and exocytosis. However, little attention has been paid to the cellular exocytosis of NPs. Herein, using a multi-step cellular subculture method, we ascertain quantitatively the endocytosis and exocytosis of widely used TiO2 NPs using the neural stem cells (NSC) as a cellular model and ICP-AES as an analytic measure. Irrespective of the type and dose of TiO2 NPs, approximately 30% of the total TiO2 NPs entered NSCs after 48 h incubation. In the first 24 h after removing TiO2NPs, from the culture medium, about 35.0%, 34.6% and 41.7% of NP1 (50 nm), NP2 (30 nm) and NTs (nanotubes, 100 nm \u00d7 4-6 nm) were released (exocytosed) from cells, respectively. The release decreased over time, and became negligible at 72 h. Exocytosis did not happen during cell division. In addition, our results suggested that both endocytosis and exocytosis of TiO2NPs were energy-dependent processes, and NPs uptake by cells was influenced by serum proteins. Furthermore, we achieved primary dynamic confocal imaging of the exocytosis, allowing tracking of TiO2 NPs from NSCs. These findings may benefit studies on nanotoxicology and nanomedicine of TiO2 NPs.",

GO-CS was a good adsorbent of Cu2+ with a large adsorption capacity of 2.54 \u00d7 101 mg/g according to the Langmuir model. The adsorption kinetics was well described by the pseudo-second-order model with a k2 of 4.14 \u00d7 10-3 min-1. The intraparticle diffusion model was adopted to reveal the diffusion mechanism. Higher pH, lower ionic strength and higher temperature benefited the adsorption. The thermodynamics parameters at 303 K were calculated as \u0394G of -3.89 kJ/mol, \u0394H of 3.46 kJ/mol and \u0394S of 2.42 \u00d7 101 J/mol/K.

However, the high dispersibility of GO makes the separation of adsorbent/pollutant composite from aqueous environment very difficult. In this study, GO was fabricated with chitosan (CS) for dye removal, where GO-CS composite was not dispersible in water and could be easily separated by filtration or low speed centrifugation. GO-CS was found to be good adsorbent of methylene blue (MB) with a huge adsorption capacity of 4.68\u00d7102 mg/g, ranking it among the most effective adsorbents of MB. The adsorption data of MB on GO-CS were well fitted to the Freundlich model, rather than the Langmuir model. When initial MB concentration was 100 mg/L, the MB solution could be decolorized to colorless by GO-CS. After the treatment, GO-CS/MB composite could be easily removed by filtration.

The pathological and electron micrographic observations of liver evidently indicate that the damage caused by non-PEGylated MWCNTs is slightly more severe than that of PEGylated MWCNTs, which means that PEGylation can partly, but not substantially, improve the in vivo biocompatibility of MWCNTs.",

Our results show that ZnO nanoparticles are highly toxic to NIH/3T3 cells, inducing viability loss, membrane leakage and morphology changes. The microenviroment, here the CO2 atmosphere under cell culture condition, promoted the solubilization of ZnO nanoparticles. Then the released Zn from ZnO nanoparticles induces the cytotoxicity.

        "abstract": "Silica nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely used in food products as an additive; however, their toxicity and safety to the human body and the environment still remain unclear. As a food additive, silica NPs firstly enter the human gastrointestinal tract along with food, thus their gastrointestinal toxicity deserves thorough study. Herein, we evaluated the toxicity of food additive silica NPs to cells originating from the gastrointestinal tract. Four silica NP samples were introduced to human gastric epithelial cell GES-1 and colorectal adenocarcinoma cell Caco-2 to investigate the effect of silica sample, exposure dose and exposure period on the morphology, viability and membrane integrity of cells. The cell uptake, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, cell cycle and apoptosis were determined to reveal the toxicity mechanism. The results indicate that all four silica NPs are safe for both GES-1 and Caco-2 cells after 24-h exposure at a concentration lower than 100\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml(-1) . At a higher concentration and longer exposure period, silica NPs do not induce the apoptosis/necrosis of cells, but arrest cell cycle and inhibit the cell growth. Notably, silica NPs do not pass through the Caco-2 cell monolayer after 4-h contact, indicating the low potential of silica NPs to cross the gastrointestinal tract in vivo. Our findings indicate that silica NPs could be used as a safe food additive, but more investigations, such as long-term in vivo exposure, are necessary in future studies.",

        "abstract": "The potential biomedical applications of fullerenol C(60)(OH)(x) (x\u224824) have been extensively studied. However, the structural information of the interaction of fullerenol with the bio-system at the molecular level, which is essential for understanding its bioactivity and toxicity, is still missing. In this study, lysozyme was selected as a model protein to investigate the interaction between fullerenol and biomolecules. A strong induced circular dichroism (CD) signal of achiral fullerenol was observed after binding with lysozyme. Activity assay shows that lysozyme activity is inhibited significantly by fullerenol. No heat capacity difference between the folded and unfolded states of lysozyme was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the presence of fullerenol, indicating that fullerenol prefers to bind with the hydrophobic residues. Both experimental and Autodock computational results suggest that the binding site on lysozyme for fullerenol is close to Trp 62, and a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction might play an important role in binding.",

We found that pi-pi interaction existed in all the proteins-fullerene/fullerenol systems investigated here, and contributed greatly to the overall interaction energy. We also found that with the increase of the carbon cage size, the binding strength between proteins and fullerenes/fullerenols increased constantly. In addition, our results show that functionalization of fullerenes with polar groups, such as hydroxyl groups, decreases the binding between proteins and fullerene derivatives. In other words, the more hydroxyl groups on fullerenols, the weaker binding between proteins and fullerenols.",

As Foxa proteins exhibit overlapping DNA-binding specificities, we examined the role of Foxa3 [hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-3gamma] in control of proglucagon gene expression. Foxa3 was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR in glucagon-producing cell lines and binds to the rat proglucagon gene G2 promoter element in GLUTag enteroendocrine cells. Although Foxa3 increased rat proglucagon promoter activity in BHK fibroblasts, augmentation of Foxa3 expression did not increase proglucagon promoter activity in GLUTag cells. Furthermore, adenoviral Foxa3 expression did not affect endogenous proglucagon gene expression in islet or intestinal endocrine cell lines. Although Foxa3(-/-) mice exhibit mild hypoglycaemia during a prolonged fast, the levels of proglucagon-derived peptides and proglucagon mRNA transcripts were comparable in tissues from wild-type and Foxa3(-/-) mice. These findings identify Foxa3 as a member of the proglucagon gene G2 element binding-protein family that, unlike Foxa1, is not essential for control of islet or intestinal proglucagon gene expression in vivo.",

However, little information of their toxicity and biocompatibility is available. Herein, we performed a comprehensive study on the toxicity of graphene oxide (GO) by examining the influences of GO on the morphology, viability, mortality and membrane integrity of A549 cells. The results suggest that GO does not enter A549 cell and has no obvious cytotoxicity. But GO can cause a dose-dependent oxidative stress in cell and induce a slight loss of cell viability at high concentration. These effects are dose and size related, and should be considered in the development of bio-applications of GO. Overall, GO is a pretty safe material at cellular level, which is confirmed by the favorable cell growth on GO film.",

Fe 3O4@C NPs were prepared from FeCl2, FeCl 3 and glucose after hydrothermal treatment at 160 C for 6 h. After characterization by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectrometer, the adsorption behaviors of MB on Fe3O4@C NPs were investigated. The results indicated that Fe3O4@C NPs adsorbed MB effectively with a large capacity of 117 mg/g. The adsorption isotherm was described by Temkin model. The adsorption reached the equilibrium within 3 h and the kinetics followed pseudo-second-order model. The increase of ionic strength inhibited the adsorption, and the decrease of pH led to the dramatic decrease in adsorption capacity. The adsorption was endothermal, thus higher temperature was preferred. The magnetic separation after adsorption was easily achieved and Fe 3O4@C NPs could be regenerated by washing with HCl aqueous solution. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

After co-incubation with cells for 24 h, FITC-TiO2-NTs localized around the cell nucleus without crossing the karyotheca. More interestingly, the nanotubes passed through the\n karyotheca entering the cell nucleus after co-incubation for 48 h. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron\n microscopy (TEM) were also employed in tracking the nanotubes in the cell. These results will be of benefit in future studies\n of TiO2-NTs for use as a drug vehicle, particularly for DNA-targeting drugs.",

The two new compounds were intensively characterized. The synthetic C(60)-tuftsin conjugates were assayed for their stability against leucine aminopeptidase degradation. And the immunostimulating activities to murine peritoneal macrophages were investigated in vitro. Compared with the natural tuftsin, significant enhancement of phagocytosis, chemotaxis activities and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecule expression were observed in macrophages stimulated by both of the conjugates. The two conjugates also exhibit complete resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis, and they are non-toxic to macrophages in the tested concentrations. On all accounts, these results suggest that the C(60)-tuftsin conjugates can be used as potential candidates of immunomodulators and vaccine adjuvants.",

However, in contrast to the wide recognition of the toxicity of CNTs, little attention has been paid to the decontamination/remediation of CNT pollution. In this study, we report that CNTs can be removed from aqueous environment. In the presence of Ca\u00b2(+), CNTs aggregate quickly to micron size and then enable easy and effective removal via normal filtration. After filtration, CNT suspension becomes colorless with the remnant CNT concentration less than 0.5 \u03bcg mL\u207b\u00b9, a safe dose based on the published data. The filtration approach also works well in the presence of typical surfactant and dissolved organic matter. The removal efficiency is Ca\u00b2(+) concentration-dependent and regulated by the initial pH value and ionic strength. Our study is helpful for future decontamination of CNTs from aqueous environment.",

Biodistribution, as fundamental information for pharmacology and toxicology, should be intensively and systematically studied to accelerate the related researches. In this review, we summarized currently applied methodology in the study of CNTs biodistribution and the achieved biodistribution data. However, the currently used methods, including isotopic labeling, Raman spectroscopy and TEM investigation, can hardly reach a perfect balance of convenience and reliability. We compared the advantage and disadvantage of each method to show diversified choices for different purposes. Based on these techniques, available data suggest that CNTs have a general trend of high reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake. But their distribution can be dramatically regulated by functionalization of the CNT surface with various molecules. For future biodistribution studies, developing convenient and reliable methods is highly required, and key parameters determining the behavior and fate of CNTs in vivo should be further explored and elicited.",

        "abstract": "The tumor-inhibitory effect of C60(OH)x was tested on the murine H22 hepatocarcinoma model. Doses of 0.2 and 1.0 mg kg-1 body weight both showed significant antitumor activity with tumor inhibition rates of 31.9 and 38.4%, respectively, when mice were treated for 17 consecutive days. The damnification of liver was prominently reduced. Furthermore, histological examination indicated that an envelope of fibroblasts and lymphocytes was formed surrounding tumor tissues in the C60(OH) x-treated group, which inhibited the infiltration of tumor to the neighboring normal skeleton muscle tissues. To understand the antitumor mechanism, the immunomodulatory activity of C60(OH)x was investigated. The results indicate that C60(OH)x enhances the phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages and elevates the activity of arginase and acid phosphatase in vivo. The tumor necrosis factor alpha production of C60(OH)x-treated macrophages also increases in vitro. These results suggest that C60(OH)x can enhance the innate immunity of tumor-bearing mice, and therefore inhibits growth of the tumor. \u00a9 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.",

Among all fluorescent probes, fluorescent proteins (FPs) might be the safest ones, which have been widely used in biological sciences at the gene level. But FPs have not been used in vivo in the purified form yet due to the instability of proteins. Here, we individually coat near-infrared (NIR) FPs (NIRFPs) with a silica nanoshell, resulting in NIRFP@silica, one of the safest and brightest NIR fluorescent nanoprobes with a quantum yield of 0.33 for in vivo imaging. The silica shell not only protects NIRFPs from denaturation and metabolic digestion, but also enhances the quantum yield and photostability of the coated NIRFPs. When injected via the tail vein, NIRFP@silica NPs can distribute all over the mouse body, and then can be efficiently eliminated through urine in 24 h, demonstrating its potential applications as a safe and robust NIR fluorescence probe for whole body imaging.",

This work studied the effects of size and injection dose on the biodistribution of GO to accelerate the development of a GO-based drug.GO samples were intravenously injected into mice. The content of GO in organs/tissues at different time points was measured using an (125)I-labeling technique. GO in the liver and lungs was further confirmed by both Raman spectroscopic and TEM observations. The dispersion state of GO in serum was evaluated by flow cytometry.Regardless of size, GO was cleared from the blood quickly and accumulated mainly in the liver and lungs. The uptake of GO in lungs increased with increasing injection dose and size. The dispersion state (i.e., size of the GO-protein complex in blood) dominated the biodistribution.The size and dose of GO affected its fate in vivo. For medical applications, small-sized GO with suitable funtionalization is recommended.",

In the present study, the toxicological effects of the pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes (p-MWCNTs) and taurine functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (tau-MWCNTs) were assessed on RAW 264.7 macrophages. We tested cell viability, GSH/GSSG ratio, apoptosis, intracellular calcium concentration, ultrastructural changes of cell morphology, and the release of IL-8. We observed the loss of cell viability, decline in the cellular GSH/GSSG ratio, increase of IL-8, and the increase of intracellular calcium concentration in RAW 264.7 macrophages when exposed to p-MWCNTs at high dosage. Additionally, exposure to p-MWCNTs resulted in ultrastructural and morphological changes in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In contrast, the RAW 264.7 macrophages exposed to the tau-MWCNTs did not exhibit altered morphology. Our results conclude that the tau-MWCNTs show lower toxicity than that of p-MWCNTs.",

Compared with the PBS group, the body-weight gain of the mice decreased and the level of total bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase increased in the MWCNT-exposed group with a significant dose-effect relationship, while tumor necrosis factor alpha level did not show significant statistical change within 60 d. Spotty necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration in portal region, hepatocyte mitochondria swelling and lysis were observed with a significant dose-effect relationship in the MWCNT groups. Liver damage of the T-MWCNT group was more severe than that of the O-MWCNT group according to the Roenigk classification system. Furthermore, T-MWCNTs induce slight liver oxidative damage in mice at 15 d, which was recovered at 60 d. Part of the gene expressions of mouse liver in the MWCNT groups changed compared to the PBS group, including GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors), cholesterol biosynthesis, metabolism by cytochrome P450, natural-killer-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, TNF- alpha, NF-kappaB signaling pathway, etc. In the P450 pathway, the gene expressions of Gsta2 (down-regulated), Cyp2B19 (up-regulated) and Cyp2C50 (down-regulated) had significant changes in the MWCNT groups. These results show that a high dose of T-MWCNTs can induce hepatic toxicity in mice while O-MWCNTs seem to have less toxicity.",

        "abstract": "The hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) and its derivatives have been successfully used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, and they frequently improve the anemia that usually accompanies these disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this action remain poorly understood. In this study, we used two erythroid models, murine erythroid leukemia cells and erythroid burst-forming unit-derived erythroblasts, to show that 5-aza-CdR induced erythroid differentiation and increased the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferrochelatase (Fech), thereby increasing iron uptake and heme biosynthesis. We have identified new regulatory E-boxes that lie outside of CpG islands in the TfR1 and Fech promoters, and the methylation status of these sites can be altered by 5-aza-CdR treatment. This in turn altered the binding of the transcription factor c-Myc to these promoter elements. Furthermore, 5-aza-CdR promoted the nuclear translocation of c-Myc and its binding to Max to form functional complexes. The coordinated actions of 5-aza-CdR on the methylation status of the target genes and in stimulating the nuclear translocation of c-Myc provide new molecular insights into the regulation of E-boxes and explain, at least in part, the increased erythroid response to 5-aza-CdR treatment.",

        "abstract": "A diverse array of carbon nanomaterials (NMs), including fullerene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, nanodiamonds, and carbon nanoparticles, have been discovered and widely applied in a variety of industries. Carbon NMs have been detected in the environment and have a strong possibility of entering the human body. The safety of carbon NMs has thus become a serious concern in academia and society. To achieve strict biosafety assessments, researchers need to fully understand the effects and fates of NMs in the human body, including information about absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/T). To acquire the ADME data, researchers must quantify NMs, but carbon NMs are very difficult to quantify in vivo. The carbon background in a typical biological system is high, particularly compared with the much lower concentration of carbon NMs. Moreover, carbon NMs lack a specific detection signal. Therefore, isotopic labeling, with its high sensitivity and specificity, is the first choice to quantify carbon NMs in vivo. Previously, researchers have used many isotopes, including \u00b9\u00b3C, \u00b9\u2074C, \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I, \u00b9\u00b3\u00b9I, \u00b3H, \u2076\u2074Cu, \u00b9\u00b9\u00b9In, \u2078\u2076Y, 99mTc, and \u2076\u2077Ga, to label carbon NMs. We used these isotopic labeling methods to study the ADME of carbon NMs via different exposure pathways in animal models. Except for the metabolism of carbon NMs, which has seldom been investigated, significant amounts of data have been reported on the in vivo absorption, distribution, excretion, and toxicity of carbon NMs, which have revealed characteristic behaviors of carbon NMs, such as reticuloendothelial system (RES) capture. However, the complexity of the biological systems and diverse preparation and functionalization of the same carbon NMs have led to inconsistent results across different studies. Therefore, the data obtained so far have not provided a compatible and systematic profile of biosafety. Further efforts are needed to address these problems. In this Account, we review the in vivo quantification methods of carbon NMs, focusing on isotopic labeling and tracing methods, and summarize the related labeling, purification, bio-sampling, and detection of carbon NMs. We also address the advantages, applicable situations, and limits of various labeling and tracing methods and propose guidelines for choosing suitable labeling methods. A collective analysis of the ADME information on various carbon NMs in vivo would provide general principles for understanding the fate of carbon NMs and the effects of chemical functionalization and aggregation of carbon NMs on their ADME/T in vivo and their implications in nanotoxicology and biosafety evaluations.",

Our results indicated that negligible alumina NPs were absorbed post-exposure and alumina NPs did not influence the balance of essential trace elements, including Fe, Cu and Zn. Preliminary toxicological evaluations suggested that alumina NPs were of low toxicity. The body weights were similar among the mice exposed to alumina NPs, alumina powder and 0.9% NaCl aqueous solution. The low toxicity was also indicated by the unchanged serum biochemical parameters.

Then, we directly incorporated the reduced Re to the antibodies IgG modified with 135 fold of NaHSO3 and 3500 fold of 2-ME, and more than 90% of specific binding was yielded in 100-150 min at room temperature. TLC analysis indicated that less than 5% of activity was in the colloid form. Radiolabeled antibodies IgG were stable to the challenging of 700 fold of DTPA, and also showed fine in vivo stability.",

In this review, basic principles, wide applications and new progresses of 14C-bio-AMS are presented. It has been a new advanced tool for measuring the adduction of biological molecules with xenobiotics, including carcinogens, drugs, agrochemicals, nicotine, etc. The successful applications have proven the effectiveness of AMS to assessing cancer risk, screening drug toxicity and studying nutrients uptake. In particular, AMS is characterized by measuring xenobiotics at very low dose levels relevant to human environmental exposure. It is sensitive and precise to an attomole (10-18 mole) or less of 14C per mg carbon. Although it has some shortcomings, undoubtedly, AMS possesses an evident merit of high sensitivity and will have widespread applications in the biomedical sciences.",

        "abstract": "Carbon nanotube (CNT) mediated drug delivery systems have currently aroused a great deal of interest. Such delivery systems for drugs, proteins and genes have been preliminarily studied using cellular and animal models. For the further study of the pharmacokinetics and related biological behaviours of CNTs in vivo, a fast and convenient tracing method is particularly demanded. In this paper, we developed a generally adoptable tracing method for the biodistribution study of functionalized CNTs in vivo. Taurine covalently functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (tau-MWNTs) and Tween-80 wrapped MWNTs (Tween-MWNTs) were labelled with (125)I, and then their distribution in mice was determined. It is interesting that Tween-80 can reduce the RES uptake of MWNTs remarkably. The resulting distribution of (125)I-tau-MWNTs was very consistent with that using (14)C-taurine-MWNTs as the CNTs tracer, which means the easy (125)I labelling method is reliable and effective.",

Herein we synthesized a polyethylene glycol monomethylether-C(60)-5FU conjugate (mPEG-C(60)-5FU) and evaluated its antitumor efficacy in vitro. The results show that the inhibition abilities of mPEG-C(60)-5FU to the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and the human gastric carcinoma cell line BGC-823 are significantly higher than that of 5FU. The conjugate has good stability in murine serum for at least 24 h. Moreover, the PEGylated fullerene (mPEG-C(60)) vehicle is non-toxic to MCF-7 cells. These results demonstrate that mPEG-C(60) is an efficient vehicle for the delivery of 5FU.",

The dose ranges of nicotine and NNK administered were from 0.4 \ufffd\ufffdg to 4.0\ufffd\ufffd102 \ufffd\ufffdg kg b.w.-1, and from 0.1 \ufffd\ufffdg to 2.0\ufffd\ufffd104 \ufffd\ufffdg kg b.w.-1, respectively. In the exposure of mice to either nicotine or NNK, the number of DNA adducts increased linearly with increasing dose. The detection limit of DNA adducts was 1 adduct per 1011 nucleotide molecules. This limit is 1-4 orders of magnitude lower than that of other techniques used for quantification of DNA adducts. The results of our animal experiments enabled us to speculate that nicotine is a potential carcinogen. According to the procedure for 14C-labeled-NNK synthesis, we discuss the ultimate chemical speciation of NNK bound to DNA. From the animal tests we derived a directly perceivable relation between tobacco consumption and DNA adduction as the carcinogenic risk assessment.",

Considering aluminum accumulation in brain is closely related to many neural diseases. We studied the neural toxicity of four nano gamma-alumina samples by using neural stem cells (NSCs) C17.2 as a model. We find that the toxicity of nano gamma-alumina is pretty low, though these alumina particles are easily internalized by cells. The loss of cell viability and membrane integrity are dose-dependent and sample-dependent after alumina exposure. At concentrations lower than 100 microg/mL, no significant toxicity is observed for all alumina samples. When the concentration reaches 200 microg/mL, alumina treated cells begin to loss their activities. No culture period effect (up to 3 days) is observed. Very tiny soluble aluminum and the absorption of culture medium ingredients onto alumina particles do not affect the cell viability. Intracellular reactive oxygen species generation may contribute to the cytotoxicity of alumina particles at high concentration, but it does not induce the apoptosis of NSCs.",

Our findings indicate that TiO(2) NPs lead to a differentiational tendency towards neurons from neural stem cells, suggesting TiO(2) NPs might be a beneficial inducer for neuronal differentiation. To insight into the possible molecular mechanism of the neuronal differentiation, we conducted a protein-protein interaction network (PIN) analysis. To this end, a global mapping of target proteins induced by TiO(2) NPs was first made by a 2-dimensional electrophoresis analysis. Results showed that 9 proteins were significantly changed and then they were subjected to the mass spectrometric assay. All 9 identified proteins are involved in signal, molecular chaperones, cytoskeleton, and nucleoprotein. Further, based on our experimental data and DIP, IntAct-EBI, GRID database, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed, which provides highly integrated information exhibiting the protein-protein interaction. By analysis of the gene expression, the signal pathway involving Cx43 phosphorylation, which is negatively regulated by the protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon), is demonstrated. It is inferred that PKCepsilon plays a pivotal negative role in the neuronal differentiation of stem neural cells in response to the TiO(2) NPs exposure.",

        "abstract": "Adducts of hemoglobin (Hb) and serum albumin (SA) with nicotine in mouse blood were measured respectively by using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The dose response of adduct levels of Hb/SA and the correlative relationship between the two blood protein adducts were investigated over a range of doses(0.1-100. 0 \u03bcg/kg body weight), which were equivalent to a low-level dose of environmental exposure of cigarette smoking. Both the levels of Hb and SA adducts increased with increasing dose and showed a linear relationship. By plotting Hb/SA adducts versus DNA adducts, a linear relationship fits the experimental observations best, which means that Hb/SA adduct could substitute for DNA adduct as a biomarker for nicotine. The detection limit of protein adduct in this work is 0. 03 pmol/g protein (namely 3. 2 adducts/1012 amino acid residues), the excellent sensitivity in protein biomarker measurements compared to the data reported previously.",

The resulted white precipitate of Al2(WO4)3 can be separated from the solution by centrifugation and decantation. The supematant containing radioactive Re as ReO 4 \u2212  was loaded onto a column (1 cm\u00d710 cm) of activated alumina (100\u2013200 mesh). Eluted with 10 ml of saline, the carrier-free ReO 4 \u2212  was collected, while the small amount of Al2(WO4)3 in the supematant was adsorbed on the column. The total yield of ReO 4 \u2212  was 94.7% and the breakthrough of WO 4 2\u2212 , only 1.0\u00b710\u22126 M. The whole separation process can be accomplished within 30 minutes.

All of these dietary constituents showed their inhibitory effects on DNA or Hb adduction. VC, VE, TP and grapestone extract could efficaciously inhibit the adductions by 33-50%, and all of these six agents could inhibit Hb adduction by 30-64%. We also investigated resveratrol, curcumin, VC and VE as inhibitors of NB-DNA adduction in vitro using liquid scintillation counting technique. These agents in the presence of NADPH and S9 components also pronouncedly blocked DNA adduction in a dose-dependent profile. Our study suggests that these seven constituents may interrupt the process of NB-induced chemical carcinogenesis.",

However, conjugates involving fullerenes or other nanomaterials often differ significantly from the free drug molecules in cellular uptake and distributions. For the highly effective anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), its strong absorption and fluorescence in the visible spectral region enable the tracking of DOX-containing conjugates by optical techniques. In this work, a stoimetrically and structurally well-defined fullerene-DOX conjugate was studied in terms of fluorescence microscopy, including the fluorescence imaging with two-photon excitation, to examine the uptake and distribution in human breast cancer cells. The results suggested that the conjugate was distributed mostly in the cytoplasm, significantly different from free DOX molecules (predominantly in the cell nucleus, as already reported in the literature). Mechanistic implications of the results are discussed. Also discussed are potentials of conjugated DOX species as self-labeled fluorescent probes in bioimaging and other mechanistic investigations on drug delivery.",

A precise analysis of the hydrolysate by HPLC\u2013AMS indicates that a majority of formic acid incorporates directly into DNA, whereas less than 1.5% might form instable formylated DNA adducts in vivo . The results greatly support the important perspective that formic acid is not carcinogenic. Moreover, this study demonstrates that a combination of HPLC with AMS is an essential means for the evaluation of DNA adduction.",

Although the oral toxicity of ZnO NPs has been studied, most of research was performed on the normal animal models. Therefore, the understanding of the biological consequence of ZnO NPs on the population with diseases, especially gastrointestinal disease, is extremely limited. In this study, a mice model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) induced by indomethacin has been developed to comprehensively investigated the bioeffects of ZnO NPs on the specific population. The effect of the intestinal inflammation/injury on the distribution and toxicity of orally administrated ZnO NPs (nZnO, 20\u202fnm\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202fnm and mZnO, ~200\u202fnm) in mice were analyzed. The results show that there is a difference in the distribution of Zn and the essential trace elements (Fe and Cu) between the IBD mice and the normal mice. We also observed an obvious size effect. Higher hepatic Zn was detected in the IBD mice post-exposure to ZnO NPs, especially bigger ZnO NPs. In addition, the histopathological examination of main organs and biological parameters analysis showed that ZnO NPs caused slight toxicity to the liver and kidney in the IBD mice. Our findings highlight the importance of the health status of animals on the bioeffects of nanomaterials.",

        "abstract": "As a novel fluorescent probe in the second near-infrared window, Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) exhibit great prospect in in vivo imaging due to their maximal penetration depth and negligible background. However, the in vivo behavior and toxicity of Ag2Se QDs still largely remain unknown, which severely hinders their wide-ranging biomedical applications. Herein, we systematically studied the blood clearance, distribution, transformation, excretion, and toxicity of polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated Ag2Se QDs in mice after intravenous administration with a high dose of 8 \u03bcmol/kg body weight. QDs are quickly cleared from the blood with a circulation half-life of 0.4 h. QDs mainly accumulate in liver and spleen and are remarkably transformed into Ag and Se within 1 week. Ag is excreted from the body readily through both feces and urine, whereas Se is excreted hardly. The toxicological evaluations demonstrate that there is no overt acute toxicity of Ag2Se QDs to mice. Moreover, in regard to the in vivo stability problem of Ag2Se QDs, the biotransformation and its related metabolism are intensively discussed, and some promising coating means for Ag2Se QDs to avert transformation are proposed as well. Our work lays a solid foundation for safe applications of Ag2Se QDs in bioimaging in the future. ",

The distribution results showed that there was no noticeable difference among the distribution profiles of ZnO-NPs, ZnO-MPs and Zn ions in mice. Zn accumulated only in the digestive tract organs after the exposure to all three samples. However, the biomedical parameters and pathological investigations showed liver lesions induced by ZnO-MPs, but fewer by ZnO-NPs or Zn ions.

Surface modification is an essential step to disperse AgSe QDs into biological fluids, and endow AgSe QDs with diverse surface chemistry. However, the effect of surface chemistry on the biological behaviors and chemical fates of AgSe QDs has not been studied, which hinders the design of suitable AgSe QDs for biomedical applications. Here, the distribution, degradation, excretion and toxicity of 2-aminoethanethiol and mercaptopropionic acid coated AgSe QDs (denoted as QDs-MEA and QDs-MPA, respectively) were systematically investigated in mice for a 28-day observation period after a single intravenous injection. AgSe QDs with different surface chemistries displayed similar trends in all observations, such as fast blood clearance, main uptake in the liver and spleen, severe biotransformation, Ag excretion through feces, and low toxicity. The major different behaviors observed were the partially pulmonary deposition, the faster transformation at the initial stage, the lower excretion percentage, and the more obvious damage to the liver by QDs-MEA compared to QDs-MPA. The surface chemistry of AgSe QDs regulated their biological behaviors and chemical fates , and surface chemistry should be fully regarded when designing AgSe QDs for biomedical applications from the biosafety perspective.",

        "abstract": "The wide use of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as antimicrobial agents has resulted in a massive release of Ag NPs into environment, such as water and soil. As bryophytes live ubiquitously in water and soil, their tolerance and response to Ag NPs could be employed as an indicator for the harm of Ag NPs to the environment. Herein, we report the study on the physiological and biochemical responses of bryophytes to Ag NPs with different surface coatings at the gametophyte stages: protonema and leafy gametophyte, by using Physcomitrella patens as a model system. We found that Ag NPs, including AgNPs-B (Ag NPs without surface coating), AgNPs-PVP (Ag NPs coated with poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)) and AgNPs-Cit (Ag NPs coated with citrate), were toxic to P. patens in terms of growth and development of the gametophyte. The toxicity was closely related to the concentration and surface coating of Ag NPs, and the growth stage of P. patens. The protonema was more sensitive to Ag NPs than the leafy gametophyte. Ag NPs inhibited the growth of the protonema following the trend of AgNPs-B\u202f>\u202fAgNPs-Cit\u202f>\u202fAgNPs-PVP. Ag NPs changed the thylakoid and chlorophyll contents, but did not affect the contents of essential elements in the protonema. At the leafy gametophyte stage, Ag NPs inhibited the growth of P. patens following a different order: AgNPs-Cit\u202f>\u202fAgNPs-B\u202f\u2248\u202fAgNPs-PVP. Ag NPs decreased the chlorophyll b content and disturbed the balance of some important essential elements in the leafy gametophytes. Both the dissolved fraction of Ag NPs and Ag NPs per se contributed to the toxicity. This study for the first time reveals the effects of Ag NPs on bryophytes at different growth stages, which calls for more attention to the nanoecotoxicology of Ag NPs.",

        "abstract": "Extensive utilization increases the exposure of humans to Ag nanoparticles (NPs) via the oral pathway. To comprehensively address the action of Ag NPs to the gastrointestinal systems in real situations, i.e., the long-term low-dose exposure, we evaluated and compared the toxicity of three Ag NPs (20-30 nm with different surface coatings) to the human intestine cell Caco-2 after 1-day and 21-day exposures, using various biological assays. In both the short- and long-term exposures, the variety of surface coating predominated the toxicity of Ag NPs in a descending order of citrate-coated Ag NP (Ag-CIT), bare Ag NP (Ag-B), and poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-coated Ag NP (Ag-PVP). The short-term exposure induced cell growth inhibition and death. The cell viability loss appeared after cells were exposed to 0.7 \u03bcg/mL Ag-CIT, 0.9 \u03bcg/mL Ag-B or >1.0 \u03bcg/mL Ag-PVP for 24 h. The short-term and higher-dose exposure also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial damage, cell membrane leakage, apoptosis, and inflammation (IL-8 level). The long-term exposure only inhibited the cell proliferation. After 21-day exposure to 0.4 \u03bcg/mL Ag-CIT, the cell viability dropped to less than 50%, while cells exposed to 0.5 \u03bcg/mL Ag-PVP remained normal as the control. Generally, 0.3 \u03bcg/mL is the non-toxic dose for the long-term exposure of Caco-2 cells to Ag NPs in this study. However, cells presented inflammation after exposure to Ag NPs with the non-toxic dose in the long-term exposure. ",

Agglomeration of nanomaterials in various systems is a common phenomenon, however, how agglomeration affects the biological consequence of nanomaterials has not been well investigated because of its complexity. Herein, we prepared variable sized agglomerates of oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (O-MWCNTs) by using Ca 2+  and studied their cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. We found the altered property of O-MWCNTs agglomerates could be controlled and adjusted by the amount of Ca 2+ . Agglomeration remarkably facilitated the cellular uptake of O-MWCNTs at the initial contact stage, due to the easy contact of agglomerates with cells. But agglomeration did not induce evident cytotoxicity when the concentration of O-MWCNTs was less than 150\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. That was assayed by cell proliferation, membrane integrity, apoptosis and ROS generation. This study suggests us that the biological behaviors of nanomaterials could be altered by their states of agglomeration.",

We found that nano-encapsulated fluorescent proteins could serve as an ideal safe and robust fluorescence probes for the in vivo bio-imaging, with whole body distribution and fast clearance from the body.

They may alter the biological effect of pollutants already existing in the real environment by different interactions. Therefore efforts should also be paid to investigate the combined toxicity of nanomaterials and pollutants. Herein, we studied the combined toxicity of oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (O-MWCNTs) and zinc ions on cells. It is found that cytotoxicity of the combined O-MWCNTs and zinc ions elevates significantly, compared with O-MWCNTs or zinc ions alone. This result comes from the assays of cell morphology, cell viability and proliferation, cell membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential and cell apoptosis. Mechanism studies indicate that O-MWCNTs absorb zinc ions and form slight aggregation. These enhance remarkably the cellular uptake of O-MWCNTs, and thus induce the death of cells by bringing in more zinc ions into cells. Our study indicates that the existence of nanomaterials could change the bioconsequence of other pollutants and emphasizes the importance of the combined toxicity research in the presence of nanomaterials.",

In this study, we find that the antibiotic gentamicin significantly enhances the antibacterial activities of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) coated silver nanoparticles (Ag-PVP NPs) by altering the properties of silver nanoparticles in culture media. The enhanced antibacterial activities of Ag-PVP NPs against three bacterial strains (S. aureus, E. coli and gentamicin-resistant E. coli) are concluded according to the data of the fractional inhibitory concentration indices, bacterial survival rates and growth curves. A thorough investigation indicates that gentamicin promotes the dissolution of Ag-PVP NPs dramatically, which not only increases the concentration of silver ions in the system but also facilitates the attachment of Ag-PVP NPs onto the surface of bacteria by mitigating the negative charge of the NPs. The corresponding sequence is the augmented bacterial growth inhibition and death. Meanwhile, it is surprisingly found that gentamicin also binds with the dissolved silver ions and then inhibits the antibacterial activity of silver ions. In other words, gentamicin plays a dual role in the antibacterial activity of Ag-PVP NPs. This study is valuable for understanding the bioeffects of nanoparticles in a complex system.",

        "abstract": "Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) are novel fluorescent probes in the second near-infrared window with great imaging quality and biocompatibility. Surface modification is an essential step to disperse Ag2Se QDs into biological fluids, and endow Ag2Se QDs with diverse surface chemistry. However, the effect of surface chemistry on the biological behaviors and chemical fates of Ag2Se QDs has not been studied, which hinders the design of suitable Ag2Se QDs for biomedical applications. Here, the distribution, degradation, excretion and toxicity of 2-aminoethanethiol and mercaptopropionic acid coated Ag2Se QDs (denoted as QDs-MEA and QDs-MPA, respectively) were systematically investigated in mice for a 28-day observation period after a single intravenous injection. Ag2Se QDs with different surface chemistries displayed similar trends in all observations, such as fast blood clearance, main uptake in the liver and spleen, severe biotransformation, Ag excretion through feces, and low toxicity. The major different behaviors observed were the partially pulmonary deposition, the faster transformation at the initial stage, the lower excretion percentage, and the more obvious damage to the liver by QDs-MEA compared to QDs-MPA. The surface chemistry of Ag2Se QDs regulated their biological behaviors and chemical fates in vivo, and surface chemistry should be fully regarded when designing Ag2Se QDs for biomedical applications from the biosafety perspective.",

        "abstract": "For many biomedical and catalytic applications, such as encapsulation of proteins/enzymes in nanoparticles (NPs), it is preferable to have well-dispersed small NPs that are stable in solution and behave quasi-homogeneously. However, conventional liquid phase methods for small-NP synthesis and functionalization usually face great difficulties in separation/purification and recycling. In addition, controlling the orientation of proteins inside NPs is also a crucial issue to maximize the activity of the encapsulated proteins. Herein, we report a solid phase method to solve these problems. Using His-tagged proteins as cores, well-dispersed core-shell silica NPs are facilely synthesized and functionalized in a column. The core His-tagged proteins are kept bound on the surface of the resin beads in the column during the entire process, making the separation/purification of NPs and their precursors during the multiple-step process as simple as a few-minutes procedure of draining and washing the column. Each obtained silica NP has an adjustable eccentric core-shell structure with only one His-tag sticking out of the particle. This single His-tag on the surface of each NP not only makes it easy for addressable and stoichiometric functionalization of the NP but also provides an easy way to reversibly assemble NPs into dimers or be oriented on the surface of large particles. Notably, this solid phase approach also provides a versatile means to control the orientation of proteins inside NPs, and the His-tag makes it easy to recycle those well-dispersed small NPs.",

        "abstract": "The massive production and wide application of vanadium dioxide nanoparticles (VO2 NPs) has raised safety concerns of VO2 NPs exposure through various routes, especially via inhalation. To determine the pulmonary toxicity of VO2 NPs in vitro, we report here on short-term (1 day) and long-term (20 days) comparative toxicity studies of VO2 NPs (denoted as C-VO2, 20\u201330 nm) and VO2 microparticles (denoted as M-VO2, \u223c1 \u03bcm) on the lung cell line A549. Different toxic effects were observed under different durations of exposures to VO2 particles. VO2 particles induced cell growth inhibition and death in a dose- and size-dependent style after short-term exposure. The cell viability dropped when the concentration of C-VO2 was 2.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121, C-VO2 causing much more severe cell viability loss than M-VO2 at the same concentration. For long-term exposure, the cell viability dropped to less than 50% after exposure to C-VO2 at a dose of 0.2 \u03bcg ml\u22121, while cells exposed to M-VO2 under the same conditions remained normal, confirming the higher toxicity of C-VO2 than that of M-VO2. Moreover, the long-term exposure to C-VO2 only inhibited the cell proliferation. We found that 0.05 \u03bcg ml\u22121 was the highest non-toxic dose of C-VO2 to A549 cells for long-term exposure. The dissolution of VO2 contributed to the cytotoxicity of VO2. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial damage, cell membrane leakage, apoptosis, and inflammation were observed in the cells after short-term exposure to VO2 particles in the concentration range tested, indicating that the possible toxicological mechanism might be ROS generation and cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. ROS generation, mitochondrial damage, and inflammation in cells were also observed during the long-term exposure to C-VO2 at concentrations of 0.1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 and 0.2 \u03bcg ml\u22121, but the cells recovered after a subsequent 5 day recovery period. Our results show that there are significant differences between the short-term and long-term cytotoxicities of VO2.",

        "abstract": "The size effect on the cellular uptake of nanoparticles (NPs) has been extensively studied, but it is still not well understood. Herein, a reductionist approach is used to minimize all influencing factors except the particle size, and co-exposure of different-sized silica nanoparticles (SNPs) is adopted instead of the common single exposure. SNPs are found being internalized by Hela cells in serum-free medium mainly via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, thus simplifying the data analysis for reliable attribution to size effects. Remarkably, even though at conditions that the size effects seem very small or even undetectable in the common single exposure experiments, the co-exposure experiments reveal significant size effects due to an unexpected interplay between two different-sized SNPs. Namely, the bigger SNPs significantly promote the cellular uptake of the smaller ones, while the smaller SNPs inhibit the internalization of the bigger ones, with a total uptake increase of the particle number of SNPs in the cells. This strong interplay between different-sized NPs might unavoidably exist within most \"single-sized\" NP products, whose sizes actually distribute in certain ranges, thus urging reconsideration of the size effect on the cellular uptake of NPs, for the benefits of both bioapplications and safety assessment of nanomaterials.",

The results demonstrated that the three dietary constituents all significantly inhibited the formation of acrylamide adducts with liver DNA, whereas tea polyphenols and diallyl trisulfide reduced protamine and hemoglobin adducts, respectively. Further biochemical studies showed that acrylamide could significantly inactivate creatine kinase and glutathione S-transferase and deplete glutathione. When the inhibitors were cotreated with acrylamide, all of them could effectively recover the activities of creatine kinase. In addition, tea polyphenols and diallyl trisulfide could increase glutathione S-transferase activity remarkably. On the basis of these results, mechanisms of the effects are discussed. This study might provide a beneficial guide to people's diet for the purpose of reducing the harmful effect of acrylamide.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the cytotoxicity and its mechanism of ZnO nanoparticles on human leukemic monocyte lymphoma cell line U937.Four different size ZnO (10, 30, 60, 500 nm) were carefully characterized. The survival rate and viability were measured by trypan blue assay and MTT assay for each size ZnO particles at different concentrations (12, 120, 240, 600, 1200 \u00b5mol/L). The zinc probe, Fluozin-3, was used to detect the intracellular free zinc. Transmission electron microscopy was adopted to observe the cellular ultrastructure and the uptake of ZnO.All four kinds of ZnO were rod shape, with a purity of > 99.9 wt%, and they were classified as zincite phase crystal and their surface areas were in accordance with the sizes. The viability (ZnO-n10: (97 \u00b1 19)%, (91 \u00b1 4)%, (24 \u00b1 4)%, (15 \u00b1 2)%; ZnO-n30: (111 \u00b1 4)%, (81 \u00b1 3)%, (24 \u00b1 2)%, (27 \u00b1 8)%; ZnO-n60: (105 \u00b1 11)%, (73 \u00b1 20)%, (43 \u00b1 11)%, (28 \u00b1 14)%; ZnO-\u00b5m: (88 \u00b1 16)%, (62 \u00b1 7)%, (22 \u00b1 4)%, (13 \u00b1 5)%) of cells exposed to ZnO decreased with the increasing of the concentration of ZnO from 12 to 600 \u00b5mol/L (r values were 0.965, 0.979, 0.998, 0.992, and the t values were 19.8, 25.3, 76.3, 40.9, respectively, P < 0.05). The liability (ZnO-n10: (98 \u00b1 1)%, (67 \u00b1 2)%, (59 \u00b1 7)%, (13 \u00b1 13)%, (5 \u00b1 4)%; ZnO-n30: (98 \u00b1 1)%, (97 \u00b1 2)%, (50 \u00b1 3)%, (20 \u00b1 14)%, (7 \u00b1 2)%; ZnO-n60: (97 \u00b1 2)%, (88 \u00b1 5)%, (48 \u00b1 10)%, (12 \u00b1 5)%, (4 \u00b1 1)%; ZnO-\u00b5m: (96 \u00b1 1)%, (76 \u00b1 3)%, (58 \u00b1 3)%, (19 \u00b1 5)%, (20 \u00b1 10)%) of cells exposed to ZnO decreased with the increasing of the concentration of ZnO from 12 to 600 \u00b5mol/L (r valued at 0.982, 0.956, 0.972, 0.980, and the t valued at 19.3, 12.1, 15.6, 18.5, respectively, P < 0.05). The increase of the zinc concentration showed by the zinc fluorescence probe was 121 \u00b1 11, which was similar to the fluorescence of cells treated with ZnAc(2) (132 \u00b1 14, F = 0.6, P > 0.05) at the Zn-equivalent concentration. There was no statistic difference for the percents of high zinc content cells in total cells exposed to ZnO-n30 (87.6 \u00b1 2.6)% and these exposed to ZnAc(2) (86.9 \u00b1 3.2)% (F = 1.5, P > 0.05).ZnO nanoparticles are highly cytotoxic to U937 cells and the solubilization of ZnO is the main toxicological mechanism.",

        "abstract": "The immunological adjuvant effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo adjuvant effect of AgNPs was evaluated with model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) in mice by intraperitoneal and subcutaneous immunization. Serum antigen-specific IgG level significantly increased in AgNPs-treated mice comparing to the control group. AgNPs induced the increase of IgG1/IgG2a ratio and antigen-specific IgE, indicating that AgNPs elicited Th2-biased immune responses. By in vitro assay, the mechanism of adjuvant effect was explored. After 48h treatment with AgNPs, both the number of leukocytes and levels of cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in abdominal lavage fluid of mice increased. The expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule on the surface of peritoneal macrophages significantly increased. AgNPs can be easily phagocytosed by peritoneal macrophages, while do not affect antigen uptake by the cell. We therefore conclude that AgNPs have significant adjuvant effect and the mechanism of this effect is mainly ascribed to the recruitment and activation of local leukocytes and especially macrophages. For the first time we found the remarkable adjuvant effect of AgNPs, and the result is beneficial for the future applications, especially in biomedicine.",

        "abstract": "Carbon nanoparticles are in all of the carbon nanomaterials that are presently widely pursued for potential bioapplications, but their in vivo biodistribution-related properties are largely unknown. In this work, highly (13)C-enriched carbon nanoparticles were prepared to allow their quantification in biological samples by using isotope-ratio mass spectroscopy. The in vivo biodistribution results are presented and discussed, and also compared with those of the aqueous suspended carbon nanotubes reported previously. The distribution profile and time dependencies are largely similar between the nanoparticles and nanotubes, with results on both suggesting meaningful accumulation in some major organs over an extended period of time. Therefore, the surface modification of carbon nanoparticles, preferably the chemical functionalization of the nanoparticles with biocompatible molecules or species, is desirable or necessary in the pursuit of these nanomaterials for various bioapplications.",

        "abstract": "New materials with good antibacterial activity and less toxicity to other species attract numerous research interest. Taking advantage of zinc oxide (ZnO) and graphene oxide (GO), the ZnO/GO composites were prepared by a facile one-pot reaction to achieve superior antibacterial properties without damaging other species. In the composites, ZnO nanoparticles (NPs), with a size of about 4 nm, homogeneously anchored onto GO sheets. The typical bacterium Escherichia coli and HeLa cell were used to evaluate the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of the ZnO/GO composites, respectively. The synergistic effects of GO and ZnO NPs led to the superior antibacterial activity of the composites. GO helped the dispersion of ZnO NPs, slowed the dissolution of ZnO, acted as the storage site for the dissolved zinc ions, and enabled the intimate contact of E. coli with ZnO NPs and zinc ions as well. The close contact enhanced the local zinc concentration pitting on the bacterial membrane and the permeability of the bacterial membrane and thus induced bacterial death. In addition, the ZnO/GO composites were found to be much less toxic to HeLa cells, compared to the equivalent concentration of ZnO NPs in the composites. The results indicate that the ZnO/GO composites are promising disinfection materials to be used in surface coatings on various substrates to effectively inhibit bacterial growth, propagation, and survival in medical devices.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the Z-scheme photocatalyst is a promising approach to extend the absorption spectra of photocatalysts and reduce the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. However, the fabrication of well-structured efficient multi-component Z-scheme photocatalysts is still a big challenge. We report here a facile one-pot method to synthesize graphene-based Z-scheme photocatalysts. The one-pot method guarantees good distribution of well-structured individual components on thin-layered rGO sheets with excellent connections. With inactive WO3 nanorods and inactive \u03b2-In2S3 nanosheets attached to the surface of the rGO sheets, the synthesized In2S3/WO3/rGO tertiary nanocomposite shows excellent visible-light catalytic activity for hydrogen production at 1524 \u03bcmol g(-1) h(-1), demonstrating unambiguously the Z-scheme catalytic mechanism. To prevent cross-reactions and interferences, our strategy was to choose no more than one ionic precipitation reaction for the one-pot process, as unwanted cross-reactions could become inevitable if many cations and anions were present. This fabrication strategy should be applicable generally to synthesize other multiple-component nanocomposites, as demonstrated also by the preliminary results of the successful synthesis of the BiVO4/WO3/rGO nanocomposite (one ionic precipitation reaction and one hydrolysis reaction) and WO3/TiO2/rGO nanocomposite (two hydrolysis reactions).

In this study, the red/near-IR emissive dye nile blue (NB) was selected as the guest, and NB@CDots were prepared in a microwave-assisted one-pot thermal carbonization synthesis with oligomeric polyethylene glycols (PEGs) as the precursor and also surface passivation species in the resulting host\u2013guest dots. The NB@CDots exhibited unique and/or favorable characteristics, including especially the bright red/near-IR fluorescence emissions, with the observed fluorescence quantum yield due to the guest nile blue species more than an order of magnitude higher than that of free nile blue molecules, all in aqueous solutions. The higher fluorescence intensities were coupled with a longer fluorescence lifetime, and also accompanied by excellent photochemical stability, making the NB@CDots high-performance fluorescence probes for bioimaging-sensing and related applications. Indeed, their potential in this regard was explored and demonstrated in the fluorescence imaging of live stem cells. The NB@CDots were also evaluated in cytotoxicity assays, and the results suggested their being nontoxic. Excellent opportunities in further development of the host\u2013guest carbon dots platform for high-performance yet nontoxic fluorescence probes are discussed.",

        "abstract": "To track the translocation of water soluble taurine multi-wall carbon nanotubes (14C-tau-MWCNTs) in lungs of the Kunming mice and evaluate the acute lung toxicity of intratracheally instilled tau-MWCNTs in Kunming mice.Healthy adult Kunming mice were randomly grouped by their body weight (5 mice in each group). The lungs of mice were intratracheally instilled with 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg of water soluble tau-MWCNTs and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as negative control. After exposure of 1, 7, 14 and 28 days, the blood and lung tissue were collected. Blood were assessed by using biochemical biomarkers of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Lung tissues were assessed by histopathology. The intratracheal instillation of 14C-tau-MWCNTs was conducted in the same way, after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 days, 14C-activity of the samples was counted in several organs, tissues, blood and feces etc.14C-activities were detected only in lungs, and with the exposure time proceeding the radioactivity descending from (80 +/- 7.7)% of the 1st day to (22 +/- 6.9)% of the 28th day. Activity of all groups of ALP and LDH went to the highest level on the 7th day postexposure, and back to the control level on the 28th day post-exposure, but LDH of 1 mg/kg group[(14.18 +/- 1.70) micromol x s(-1) x L(-1)] was still higher than that of control [(10.95 +/- 3.51) micromol x s(-1) x L(-1)] after 28 days' exposure. There was no significant changes observed in the activity of ACE. Histopathology found that lungs of all groups presented significant increase in pulmonary inflammation, lung cell proliferation. Many tau-MWCNTs were clearly found in some alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells.Intratracheal instillation of water soluble tau-MWCNTs could induce slight bio-effects on lungs of Kunming mice.",

        "abstract": "The ethic issue of the university can be divided into the dominant ethic issue and the hidden ethic issue according to its form and nature. Dominant ethic has become the central issue of criticisms from scholars and the public, and therefore dominant ethic has little space to survive. However, the hidden ethic issues of university are common problems with the rigid, inherent and formal characters. Individuals often lack sufficient power and effective strategy to defend against the hidden ethic issues. For most people, there are no choices but to obey them. There are some negative effects in promoting educational equity and building a good style of study, nurturing talent and playing the fourth function of university. For example, the abuse of standards of \"211\", \"985\" not only violate basic ethics and encourage examination doctrine, but also make society solely counting on credentials and academic diplomas. In order to deal with such issues, the first thing we should do is to know the public nature of the universities and understand the complexity of policymaking. Then in terms of the specific strategies, we should avoid the disadvantages of the elites\u2019 decision-making mechanism and finally make the decision-making process more diverse and democratic.",

Nanomaterials B1. Sulfides 1 Introduction Recently, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure materials are attractive research areas for their unique electronic and mechanical properties and potential implementation as devices [1\u20135] . Pursuing convenient routes to synthesize one-dimensional nanostructure materials is interesting research work. Antimony sulfide (Sb 2 S 3 ) crystal has a layered orthorhombic structure [6] . Sb 2 S 3 is regarded as a promising material for solar energy due to its band gap which covers the range of the solar spectrum [7,8] . Sb 2 S 3 thin films have attracted great research attention for their special applications as a target material for microwave devices [9] , switching devices [10] , rechargeable storage cell [11] and various optoelectronic devices [12,13] . Besides an elemental reaction, Sb 2 S 3 can be prepared by chemical routes: SbCl 3 reacts with different sulfide ion sources, such as ammonium sulfide, thiourea, sodium thiosulfate and thioacetamide, as well as with complexing agents in aqueous or non-aqueous solution [14\u201317] . However, most of the as-prepared Sb 2 S 3 materials are amorphous, and they need to be annealed at high temperatures in air or in N 2 atmosphere in order to crystallize. In addition, crystalline Sb 2 S 3 can be obtained directly via a two-heater method [18] , liquid-mediated metathetical reactions [19] and thermal decomposition of some chemical complexes [20] . Recently, solvothermal method has been applied to synthesize Sb 2 S 3 nanoparticles [21] and nanorods [22] and micro-tubular Sb 2 S 3 crystals [23] . Yang et al. have reported a hydrothermal growth of Sb 2 S 3 microtubular crystals [24] . We have been exploring hydrothermal method to prepare 1D nanostructure materials. In this paper, crystalline Sb 2 S 3 nanorods were synthesized via a hydrothermal route starting from SbCl 3 and Na 2 S at temperatures ranging from 160\u00b0C to 200\u00b0C. The as-prepared Sb 2 S 3 are well-defined crystalline nanorods with dimensions of 30\u2013100 nm in diameter and 0.3\u20135 \u03bcm in length. In this method, no organic precursor or complexing agent was needed. As compared with other methods, this hydrothermal route is more convenient and environmentally friendly. 2 Experimental procedure All of the reactants were of analytical grade and were used without any further purification. A total of 1.38 g (6 mmol) antimony trichloride (SbCl 3 ) was added to 20 ml distilled water with stirring, then the solution of 4.5 g (10 mmol) sodium sulfide (Na 2 S\u00b79H 2 O) in 10 ml distilled water was mixed with it. The mixture was put into a Teflon-liner autoclave of 50 ml capacity and was stirred. Then, the autoclave was maintained constantly at 180\u00b0C for 12 h. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally in 3 h. After filtering and washing with distilled water and absolute ethanol, the final gray products with a metallic luster were collected and dried in a vacuum at 60\u00b0C for 4 h. These products were characterized by X-ray power diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/Max- \u03b3 X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu K \u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb =1.54178 \u00c5). TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were taken with a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope, using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the products were collected on an ESCALAB MK II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, using monochromatized Mg K \u03b1 radiation as the excitation source. The diffuse reflection spectrum was obtained on a Shimadzu UV-240 recording spectrophotometer. 3 Results and discussion A typical XRD pattern of the as-prepared product is shown in Fig. 1 . All the peaks in the pattern can be indexed to an orthorhombic phase Sb 2 S 3 . The calculated lattice parameters are a =11.22 \u00c5, b =11.28 \u00c5, c =3.84 \u00c5, which are in agreement with the reported values. 1 1 JCPDS Card File: 42-1393. No characteristic peaks are observed for the other impurities such as antimony oxides or SbOCl. We have observed the morphology and structure of the Sb 2 S 3 products using TEM. The TEM image ( Fig. 2a ) reveals that the morphology of Sb 2 S 3 is rod-like with a diameter of 30\u2013100 nm and a length of 0.3\u20135 \u03bcm. The morphology of a single nanorod is presented in Fig. 2b . The SAED pattern in Fig. 2b (inset) indicates the single crystal nature of the nanorod. The chemical state and composition of as-prepared sample is characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectra. There are no peaks for the elements or oxides in the XPS survey spectrum ( Fig. 3a ). The core level spectra of S 2p and Sb 3d of the as-prepared samples are shown in Figs. 3b and c . The peak at 160.8 eV corresponds to the S 2p binding energy, and the peaks at 529.5 and 538.6 eV correspond to Sb 3d binding energy. The results are in agreement with the reported values of Sb 2 S 3 in the literature [24,25] . The peak areas of Sb 3d and S 2p are quantified to give a molar ratio of Sb to S of 2:2.9, which is close to the anticipated value. The study of the optical properties of materials can provide some information concerning the band structure. The diffuse reflectance spectrum of the nanorods is shown in Fig. 4 . It is obvious that the diffuse reflectance descends sharply around 750 nm. The value of the band gap, obtained by the intersection point of the tangent of the absorption edge with extended line of the diffuse reflectance at lower wavelengths, is about 1.76 eV. This value of the band gap is close to the reported value in the literature [22,23] and is close to the bulk value of band gap of Sb 2 S 3 [26] . The various influences on the growth of Sb 2 S 3 nanorods were investigated. When the reaction temperature was lower than 120\u00b0C, amorphous products were primarily obtained. When the temperature was between 160\u00b0 and 200\u00b0C, crystalline Sb 2 S 3 products were obtained. TEM images of different reaction time were shown in Fig. 5 . When the reaction time was 4 h, the product had a small amount of nanorods and a large amount of particles. It can also be seen that some short rod-like crystals grow from the particle over a short reaction time ( Fig. 5a ). When the reaction lasted for 10 h or longer, almost only nanorods were observed by means of TEM ( Figs. 2a and 5b ). The concentration of the reagent Na 2 S\u00b79H 2 O plays an important role in the growth of Sb 2 S 3 nanorods. When the sulfide ions are insufficient, the final product suffers from impurities that may be due to the incomplete reaction of the hydrolysate. When the molar ratio of reactants is near the stoichiometric ratio, dendritic Sb 2 S 3 products are produced ( Fig. 5c ). Only when the reagent of Na 2 S\u00b79H 2 O is used in a 10\u201330% excess over SbCl 3 , uniform Sb 2 S 3 nanorods can be obtained. This indicates that an appropriate excess sulfide ions favor the growth of nanorods. Further studies show that the cooling rate also affects the morphologies of Sb 2 S 3 nanorods. Prolonging the cooling time, the obtained Sb 2 S 3 nanorods are more uniform in length and diameter. Rapid cooling down the autoclave to room temperature by cold water increases the distribution of diameter and length of the products. Based on the experimental results, the growth process is discussed as follows. An important feature of the reaction is that the pH value of the final solution becomes lower than that of the initial solution. We suppose that Sb 2 S 3 nanorods grow from the decomposition of thioantimonate ions with H + . In our growth of Sb 2 S 3 nanorods, SbCl 3 is strongly hydrolyzed to produce hydrogen chloride and a white precipitate (SbOCl), which may cover on the SbCl 3 and further slow down the hydrolysis. When the solution of Na 2 S is added, the colour of the white precipitate turns into orange, which may be due to the formation of amorphous antimony sulfide [27] . To our knowledge, some complex thioantimonate SbS n m \u2212 ions of Sb(III) exist in aqueous solution in the presence of sulfide ions [28] . The amorphous antimony sulfide on SbOCl surface reacts with S 2\u2212 to form thioantimonate ions and dissolves into the water. After that, the inner SbOCl can be sequentially converted into Sb 2 S 3 and the core SbCl 3 can gradually transform into SbOCl and produce H + . Under the condition of the hydrothermal process, the SbS n m \u2212 ions could be decomposed to form Sb 2 S 3 crystals in the presence of H + [24] . Owing to the dissolution and decomposition of the SbS n m \u2212 , crystalline Sb 2 S 3 can be prepared. As we know, the growth of rod-like is a preferred growth habit of the Sb 2 S 3 , which has already been described previously [29] . Thus, the freshly produced Sb 2 S 3 nanocrystals may act as seed crystal. Under certain hydrothermal condition, amorphous Sb 2 S 3 can be converted into crystalline Sb 2 S 3 nanorods when the dissolution and crystallization are going on, which is similar to a traditional recrystallization process. The whole process can be described by SbCl 3 \u2192 H 2 O SbOCl \u2192 S 2\u2212 Sb 2 S 3 ( am .) \u21cc S 2\u2212 SbS n m\u2212 ( aq .) \u2192 H + Sb 2 S 3 ( nanorods ). Obviously, the excessive sulfur source plays a key role in the formation of the Sb 2 S 3 nanorods, which is consistent with experimental results mentioned above. In addition, the solubility of SbS n m \u2212 may be higher at the reaction temperature than that at room temperature. The high degree of supersaturation may lead to the increase of the distribution of diameter and length of the nanorods at a fast cooling rate. 4 Conclusion Single crystalline Sb 2 S 3 nanorods have been synthesized by a hydrothermal method at temperatures in the range of 160\u2013200\u00b0C. The as-prepared Sb 2 S 3 nanorods are with dimensions of 30\u2013100 nm in diameter and 0.3\u20135 \u03bcm in length. XRD and XPS results reveal that the nanorods were pure Sb 2 S 3 . The prepared Sb 2 S 3 nanorods may have potential applications related to their physical properties of a single nanorod. In addition, this hydrothermal route is very convenient for synthesizing well-defined crystalline Sb 2 S 3 nanorods. Acknowledgements The authors thank Prof. G.E. Zhou and W.Q.

Then the spheres stick with each other to form peanut-shaped morphology. Finally, composite rods are fully developed from the composite spheres. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to characterize the PVAc in the composite. Ultra violet\u2013visible spectra were also recorded and the analysis suggests that the as-prepared CdS in the composite are quantum sized.",

We developed a 3D cell scaffold with luminescence-based oxygen sensing capability that opens the possibility of 3D mapping of oxygen level during cell growth. Hydrogel inverted opal scaffold was prepared by photo-polymerization of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (pHEMA) and poly(methacryloyloxy)ethyl-trimethylammonium chloride (pMEATAC) monomer using close-packed bead assembly as template. Tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium chloride (Ru(dpp)(3)), was coated on the pHEMA-pMEATAC 3D scaffolds by layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly. pHEMA-pMEATAC copolymer was coated on top of the Ru(dpp)(3) layer as a protection layer. The fluorescence emission of Ru(dpp)(3) can be dynamically quenched by oxygen. By measuring the emission intensity of the scaffold, the local oxygen level can be monitored. The hydrogel scaffolds are transparent, and thus 3D fluorescence intensity can be mapped by confocal microscopy. Human bone marrow stromal cells HS-5 were successfully cultured on the oxygen sensing scaffold, and the observed Ru(dpp)(3) emission intensity from the scaffold was stronger in cell rich area, which indicates a lower oxygen level due to the consumption of the cells.",

        "abstract": "Successful regeneration of biological tissues in vitro requires the utilization of three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds that provide a near natural microenvironment for progenitor cells to grow, interact, replicate, and differentiate to form target tissues. In this work, a rapid aqueous photo-polymerization route was developed toward the fabrication of a variety of polymer hydrogel 3D inverted colloidal crystal (ICC) scaffolds having different physical and chemical properties. To demonstrate the versatility of this technique, a variety of polymer hydrogel ICC scaffolds were prepared, including (1) polyacrylamide (pAAM) scaffolds, (2) poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) scaffolds, (3) poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) (pHEA) scaffolds, and composite scaffolds including (4) pAAM-pHEMA scaffolds, (5) pHEMA-pMAETAC [poly(2-methacryloyloxy) trimethyl ammonium] scaffolds, and (6) pHEA-pMEATAC scaffolds. Templates for scaffolds incorporated both uniform sized (104 microm diameter) and nonuniform sized (100 +/- 20 microm diameter) closely packed noncrosslinked poly(methyl methacrylate) beads. Human bone marrow stromal HS-5 cells were cultured on the six different types of scaffolds to demonstrate biocompatibility. Experimental results show that cells can remain viable in these scaffolds for at least 5 weeks. Of the six scaffolds, maximal cell adhesion and proliferation are obtained on the positively charged composite hydrogel pHEMA-pMEATAC and pHEA-pMAETAC scaffolds.",

It is located 89.2% from the left end of the P2 genome, which is within the coding part of the A gene, in a region devoid of secondary structures. The A gene has been cloned into an expression vector, and the A protein has been purified. The purified A protein does not bind to double-stranded ori containing DNA, but it cleaves single-stranded ori containing DNA, which indicates that a special DNA structure and/or protein is required to make the ori accessible for the A protein.",

The sequence of the 76\u00b77 to 80\u00b72% has been determined previously, and the sequence of the 80\u00b72 to 91\u00b76% region is now reported. The sequenced region contained gene A, which predicts a 761 amino acid polypeptide known to induce a single-strand cut at or near ori , and ori , which has been located by electron microscopy to about 89% from the left end of the phage genome. Analysis of plasmid-encoded proteins in minicells indicated that the A gene product was about 78 kilodaltons. Five previously unknown open reading frames ( orf-80, orf-81, orf-82, orf-83 and orf-91 ) were discovered. They have been cloned and their respective products were identified. The products of orf-80, orf-82 and gene A were found to be lethal to the host when overexpressed. The predicted amino acid sequences of the orf-82 and orf-83 gene products were similar to two early gene products of phage 186; the orf-91 product resembled the hypothetical protein of orfd of retron Ec67. Similarities between the products of P2 gene A , 186 gene A and orf2 and orf3 of Ec67 were also found. A P2 mini-chromosome has been constructed that contains only the P2 A gene and the \u03b2-lactamase gene as a marker.",

The P2 A protein belongs to a family of proteins involved in the initiation of rolling circle DNA replication, and the prototype for this family is the well-characterized A protein of phage phi X174. One of the common motifs of this family contains two conserved tyrosine residues, which have been shown to be able to alternate in catalyzing the cleavage as well as joining reactions in the phi X174 A protein. We investigated the role of the conserved tyrosine residues in P2 A protein by in vitro mutagenesis. Only one of the two conserved tyrosine residues was found to be involved in the cleavage reaction. The tyrosine residue dispensable for cleavage and ligation is, however, required at some other stage of the P2 growth cycle, since viable recombinants containing this mutation could not be obtained. The sequence requirements for cleavage of the target site were analyzed with a set of oligonucleotides having single base alterations in the nick region, and the results indicate that only five core nucleotides need to be conserved for efficient cleavage.",

Here, we describe a targeted approach to treating pancreatic cancer with effective therapeutic efficacy and safety in noninvasive imaging models. We developed a versatile expression vector \"VISA\" (VP16-GAL4-WPRE integrated systemic amplifier) and a CCKAR (cholecystokinin type A receptor) gene-based, pancreatic-cancer-specific promoter VISA (CCKAR-VISA) composite to target transgene expression in pancreatic tumors in vivo. Targeted expression of BikDD, a potent proapoptotic gene driven by CCKAR-VISA, exhibited significant antitumor effects on pancreatic cancer and prolonged survival in multiple xenograft and syngeneic orthotopic mouse models of pancreatic tumors with virtually no toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Clinical experience with suicide gene therapy for prostate cancer using first-generation approaches has provided a basis for developing improved strategies. Given the low proliferation rate exhibited by prostate cancer, one improvement would be to develop suicide genes that effectively kill both dividing and nondividing cells. A second improvement would be to restrict cytotoxicity to prostate cancer cells, limiting injury of nondiseased tissue. Here we describe a novel approach to achieving both goals based on: (a) the use of a small, but potent, prostate-specific composite promoter, ARR(2)PB, based on the rat probasin gene; and (b) the use of a powerful artificial death switch, called inducible caspase-9 (iCaspase-9). ARR(2)PB includes two copies of the androgen response region (ARR), each containing two androgen receptor (AR)-binding sites, placed upstream of the probasin promoter elements necessary for basal transcription. Because iCaspase-9 contains two binding sites for the dimeric ligand, AP20187, administration of chemical inducers of dimerization leads to aggregation and caspase activation, followed by rapid apoptosis in both dividing and nondividing cells. Using both reagents, we constructed two novel adenoviruses (ADVs), ADV.ARR(2)PB-iCasp9 expressing iCaspase-9 and control ADV.ARR(2)PB-EGFP expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We demonstrate that tissue specificity is not sacrificed in an ADV backbone because the marker protein, EGFP, is expressed in R1881-stimulated ADV.ARR(2)PB-EGFP-transduced LNCaP cells but not in AR(-) PC-3, 293, HuH-7, U-87, and MCF-7 cells. Similarly, Pro-iCaspase-9 is expressed in ADV.ARR(2)PB-iCasp9-infected LNCaP cells after R1881 administration and is activated after AP20187 administration. In vitro experiments revealed rapid and efficient iCaspase-9-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells in both an R1881- and AP20187-dependent manner. Only 28, 8, and 0.5% survival of LNCaP cells was seen at multiplicities of infection of 2, 10, and 25, respectively. Furthermore, at a multiplicity of infection of 10, extraordinary sensitivity to AP20187 was seen (IC(50), approximately 3 pM). In vivo experiments showed that ADV.ARR(2)PB-iCasp9 induced apoptosis in LNCaP but not in HuH-7 xenograft tumors in an AP20187-dependent manner. Furthermore, a simple i.p. injection of AP20187 dramatically suppressed LNCaP tumor growth in nude mice and led to a significantly increased host survival. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using tissue-specific expression of cell cycle-independent iCaspases as a nonmutagenic alternative modality for prostate cancer suicide gene therapy.",

        "abstract": "Tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory elements can increase the safety of gene therapy vectors. Unlike prostate-specific antigen (PSA/hK3), whose expression displays an inverse correlation with prostate cancer grade and stage, human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2) is upregulated in higher grade and stage disease. Therefore, our goal was to develop a strong and prostate-specific hK2-based promoter for targeted gene therapy. We identified the minimum \"full-strength\" hK2 enhancer and built transcriptional regulatory elements composed of multiple tandem copies of this 1.2-kb enhancer, fused to the hK2 minimal promoter. Relative to the weak induction of the minimal hK2 promoter by androgen analog (R1881) in androgen receptor (AR)-positive LNCaP cells, transcriptional activity was increased by 25-, 44-, 81-, and 114-fold when one to four enhancers were spliced to the hK2 promoter, respectively. In contrast, the enhancer/promoter elements were inactive in the AR(-) prostate cancer line PC-3 and in a panel of nonprostate lines, including 293, U87, MCF-7, HuH-7, and HeLa cells. Furthermore, we generated a recombinant adenovirus, ADV.hK2-E3/P-EGFP, expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the hK2 triplicate enhancer/promoter, and compared its properties with ADV.CMV-EGFP expressing EGFP under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/promoter. Unlike the CMV promoter, the hK2-E3/P promoter was at least 100-fold inducible by R1881 in the adenoviral backbone. Compared with in situ injection of subcutaneous LNCaP tumors with ADV.CMV-EGFP, which led to detectable EGFP expression in tumor, liver, and brain tissue, ADV.hK2-E3/P-EGFP injection led to robust but tumor-restricted EGFP expression. These results suggest that the hk2 multienhancer/promoter should be a powerful novel reagent for safer targeted gene therapy of prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Skeletonization is an important procedure of automated palmprint identification system based on the characteristic of minutiae. Skeleton acquired by traditional thinning algorithms will produce many spurious minutiae which are caused by spurs and misconnections between ridges. The excessive erosion is also a common problem in thinning algorithm. Moreover, unit skeleton cannot be produced by some of these algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a thinning algorithm, which is based on Rotation Invariant Thinning Algorithm introduced by Ahmed and Ward (A-W). The proposed method can solve the above problems. The experimental result shows some skeletons from local regions of palmprint images and running time of the algorithm, which shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance without reducing efficiency.",

Investigation of the PI influx showed that chitosan induced irreversible cell membrane damage. The efflux of potassium ions from the cytosol into the extracellular matrix demonstrated that chitosan induced the leakage of intracellular components. Massive intracellular bis-(1, 3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol [DiBAC(3)] accumulation indicated the dissipation of membrane potential. Furthermore, chitosan clearly decreased the activity of H/K ATPase.

        "abstract": "The biocontrol activity and chemical composition of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens SPS-41 were investigated. The VOCs inhibited mycelial growth and spore germination in Ceratocystis fimbriata, which causes black rot disease in sweet potato tuber roots (TRs), and showed wide-spectrum antifungal activity against several plant pathogenic fungi. Microscopic examination of C. fimbriata cells suggested morphological changes and loss of cellular contents. Different inoculation strategies significantly affected the antifungal activity of the VOCs. In the volatile profile of SPS-41, the most abundant compound 3-methyl-1-butanol, followed by phenylethyl alcohol and 2-methyl-1-butanol, showed strong inhibition toward C. fimbriata. The weight loss rate and disease severity of the TRs was significantly reduced in response to the VOCs emitted by SPS-41. The results suggest that the VOCs produced by P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens SPS-41 might constitute an attractive biological fumigant to control black rot disease in sweet potato TRs.",

In this study, the antifungal action of oleoyl-chitosan nanoparticles was investigated against V. dahliae. Media containing oleoyl-chitosan nanoparticles dramatically decreased the mycelium growth. The highest antifungal indexes were observed on media amended with 2mg/mL nanoparticles. Optical microscopy showed that spore germination and hyphae morphology were affected. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated degenerative alterations including crumpled hyphae and spores, thickened cell walls, disappeared membranous organelles, massive vacuolation of the cytoplasm, and cell wall-plasmalemma separation. Fluorescence microscopy showed that nanoparticles were internalized by fungal cells. The sharp increase in the release of intracellular components and decrease of total cellular protein concentration demonstrated damaged cell membranes. Overall, the results indicate that oleoyl-chitosan nanoparticles have the potential to control phytopathogens in agriculture.",

Following the idea of contract, universities should take teaching and cultivating talents as first task, and realize the following change: from administrator to the provider of instructional service, from the view of student as product to the view of service as product. And universities should response to social demand adaptively and acutely.",

        "abstract": "Chromatin modification through histone deacetylase inhibition has shown evidence of activity against malignancies. The mechanism of action of such agents are pleiotropic and potentially tumor specific. In this study, we studied the mechanisms of vorinostat-induced cellular effects in gliomas. The effects of vorinostat on proliferation, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle effects were studied in vitro (D54, U87 and U373 glioma cell lines). To gain additional insights into its effects on human gliomas, vorinostat-induced changes were examined ex vivo using a novel organotypic human glioma slice model. Vorinostat treatment resulted in increased p21 levels in all glioma cells tested in a p53 independent manner. In addition, cyclin B1 levels were transcriptionally downregulated and resulted in reduced kinase activity of the cyclin B1/cdk1 complex causing a G2 arrest. These effects were associated with a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in association with hyperacetylation of core histones and induction of apoptosis. Of particular significance, we demonstrate histone hyperacetylation and increased p21 levels in freshly resected human glioma specimens maintained as organotypic slice cultures and exposed to vorinostat similar to cell lines suggesting that human glioma can be targeted by this agent. Our data suggest that the effects of vorinostat are associated with modulation of cell cycle related proteins and activation of a G2 checkpoint along with induction of apoptosis. These effects are mediated by both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms which provide potential options that can be exploited to develop new therapeutic approaches against gliomas.",
