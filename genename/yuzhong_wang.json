The treatment group was treated with XCD, and the control group was treated with mosapride, an intestinal energetic agent. The therapeutic course for both groups was 30 days. The 72-h colonic transition test was conducted and the symptom scores were observed before and after treatment; the adverse reaction rate and clinical efficacy were calculated after treatment; and the recurrence rate in one year was followed-up.Symptom scores were significantly improved in the treatment group after treatment, with the improvement significantly superior to that in the control group (P < 0.01). The cure rate and the total effective rate were 76.27% and 93.22% in the treatment group respectively, while they were 47.45% and 72.87% in the control group, showing significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.01). Besides, the 1-year recurrence rate was significantly lower (chi2 = 10.40, P = 0.001) and the improvement of colonic motor function was more in the treatment group than those in the control group (P < 0.01). Only low incidence (5.08% in the treatment group and 8.47% in the control group) of mild gastrointestinal reactions was shown, which caused no influence on the treatment.XCD could effectively improve the motility of the digestive tract, and it is effective and safe for the treatment of STC.",

When the feed ratio of PPDO and HEC was adjusted, as well as the molecular weight of PPDO, a series of HEC-g-PPDO copolymers with different microstructure parameters were obtained. The chemical structure, thermal stability, and thermal transition behaviors were investigated by FT-IR, 1H NMR, TG, DSC, and nano DSC, respectively. These amphiphilic HEC-g-PPDO copolymers can self-assembly into micelles. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) and the hydrodynamic diameters were determined by fluorescence and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses. It was found that both the degree of substitution (DS) and polymerization (DP) of PPDO had an effect on the thermal stability, crystallization, and micellization of HEC-g-PPDO copolymers. Due to the crystallization of PPDO side chain, HEC-g- 11.7PPDO 0.15 whose DP and DS are 11.7 and 0.15, respectively, shows a minimum CMC value. The micelle size was in the range of 200-800 nm depending on the microstructure parameters of HEC-g-PPDO copolymers. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "The molecular design for inherently flame-retardant poly(lactic acid) (IFR-PLA) was outlined and achieved by chemically incorporating an effective organophophorus-type flame retardant (FR) into the PLA backbone via the chain extension of the dihydroxyl terminated prepolymer with 1, 6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). The structure of IFR-PLA was characterized by 1 H- and 31 P- nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. IFR-PLA was further blended with the commercial PLA to prepare flame retardant PLA blends (PLA-FR blend). The relevant properties of IFR-PLA and PLA-FR blends were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), limiting oxygen index (LOI) measurements and UL-94 tests. The thermal analysis revealed that the char yield of IFR-PLA and PLA-FR blend above 400 \u00b0C was greatly enhanced compared to that of pure PLA. The LOI value was significantly improved from 19 for pure PLA to 29 when 1 wt% of phosphorus content was introduced and all IFR-PLA samples achieved V-0 rating in the UL-94 tests. PLA-FR blends had an LOI value of 25\u02dc26 and UL-94 V-2 rating at 20 wt% of IFR-PLA content. The tensile strength of all the FR PLA systems was ca. 60 MPa. The method used in this study provided a novel route to permanently flame retard PLA. Keywords Flame retardance Poly(lactic acid) Chain-extension Phosphorus",

The rheological behaviors of flame-retardant PVA/APP/LDH hybrid systems were investigated using parallel-plate rheometer. The shear-thinning phenomenon occurred in the hybrid systems within the whole frequency range studied. When the concentration of PVA in aqueous solution was 9% (w/w) and its proportion was 85% in the PVA/APP/LDH system, the complex viscosity of the hybrid systems increased first and then decreased as the proportion of LDH increased from 1% to 3%. According to the analysis of the rheological parameters and plots including the storage (G\u2032) and loss modulus (G\u2033), dynamic loss tangent (tan \u03b4), Cole-Cole plot, relaxing time, etc, it can be concluded that the viscous rather than elastic rheological behavior is dominant, namely G\u2033>G\u2032 and tan \u03b4 > 1. Therefore, the rheological behaviors of PVA/APP/LDH system were more complicated than PVA and PVA/APP systems.",

It was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), 1H NMR and 31P NMR, Elemental Analysis (EA) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). Combined with ammonium polyphosphate (APP), a new intumescent flame retardant (IFR) was obtained. The flammability behaviors of polypropylene (PP)/IFR system were investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94) and cone calorimetry. With 25 wt% of IFR (APP:PTPA = 2:1), the PP/IFR system could achieve a LOI value of 34.0% and UL-94 V-0 rating, and the heat release rate (HRR), peak heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR) and smoke production rate (SPR) were considerably reduced, especially HRR and SPR were decreased by 85% and 79%, respectively. The results indicate that there is an excellent synergism between APP and PTPA, which endows PP with both good flame retardancy and good smoke suppression. Furthermore, the thermal degradation mechanism of IFR and the flame-retardant mechanism of PP/IFR system were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), FT-IR, TG-FTIR and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The study on the flame-retardant mechanism of IFR indicated that a structure containing -CN was formed due to the reaction between APP and PTPA. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The flammability of the PS/AP composites was investigated by the limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94) and cone calorimeter test. When the content of AP reaches 25 wt%, the LOI of PS/AP is 25.6% and it passes UL-94 V-0 rating. The results of cone calorimeter test show that the heat release rate (HRR), the total heat release (THR) and the mass loss rate (MLR) of PS/AP composites are significantly reduced. The thermal degradation mechanism of PS/AP was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), thermal gravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR), pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and X-ray photoelectron analysis (XPS) tests. The results indicate that PS/AP has a combined gas-phase and condensed-phase activity in the combustion and degradation of the composites. Consequently, a possible flame-retardant mechanism of PS/AP composites is proposed. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The inherent viscosities of PBPPP increased with the increase.of ratios of BPA/PPD, the reaction temperature and time, but they behaviored opposite varrations when the ratio of BPA/PPD, the reation temperature and the reaction time were beyond 1:0.990, 280\u00b0C and 4.5h, respectively.

The structures of PBPPP were characterized by FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 31P-NMR and elemental analysis. The thermal behavior was evaluated by DSC and TG. The thermal analysis indicated that the T g of PBPPP was at 107\u00b0C and PBPPP's starting loss weight at about 310\u00b0C . The LOI of PET containing 10wt% PBPPP was 28.0, which show that PBPPP can be used as flame retardants.",

        "abstract": "The ionomer concept was introduced to the field of flame-retardant polyesters for the first time. The ionic monomer, sodium salt of 2-hydroxyethyl 3-(phenylphosphinyl)propionate (SHPPP), was synthesized by selective esterification of 3-(hydroxyphenylphosphinyl)propionic acid with ethylene glycol, followed by neutralization with sodium carbonate anhydrous. SHPPP was characterized with 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Polyethylene terephthalate)-based ionomers containing terminal units derived from this ionic monomer, were synthesized by melt polycondensation. The chemical structure of the ionomers was characterized with 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The effects of SHPPP on the thermal properties and melting behaviors of the ionomers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The flammability of the ionomers was characterized by the limiting oxygen index test. The test results show that the ionomers themselves possess both excellent flame retardancy and antidripping properties. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In order to enhance the miscibility between TPS and PBS, reactive PBS (RPBS) with terminal NCO group was synthesized first and then blended with TPS. The mechanical properties of the TPS were greatly improved after blending with RPBS, the tensile strength was increased to 10 times more than TPS even only 10 wt% RPBS was introduced. The water absorption of the blend was significantly reduced with increasing RPBS content. SEM results suggest RPBS to be uniformly distributed in the TPS matrix, and the size of the RPBS phase was decreased with reducing intrinsic viscosity of RPBS. The study of contact angle indicated that the hydrophobicity of the blend was largely enhanced toward TPS. With improved mechanical properties and reduced water absorption, the materials could find more extensive applications.",

The prepolymers and the resulting PPDO/PEG multiblock copolymers were characterized by various analytical techniques such as FT-IR, 1 H NMR, GPC, DSC and TG. At high concentration levels above critical gelation concentration (CGC), the aqueous solution of copolymers formed a gel. Temperature-sensitive gel to sol transition behaviors were investigated by the test tube inverting method. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to investigate the micelle of copolymers, whose association probably caused the gelation of the system.

Transesterification between PBT and PBS during the chain-extension reaction has been investigated in detail. Both random and block PBT-PBS copolymers can be synthesized by changing the prepolymers' molecular weights at a given reaction time and temperature. The chemical structures and sequence distributions of the copolyesters were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H-NMR) spectroscopy. The thermal transition behaviours of copolyesters with different sequence distribution were characterized by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The number-average molecular weight (M n) of HO-PBT-OH played a dominant role in the sequence distribution of the resulting copolyesters. The degree of randomness of the copolymer was around 1 when M n of HO-PBT-OH was 5000 g mol -1 regardless of that of HO-PBS-OH, it decreased to less than 1 when M n of HO-PBT-OH was more than 10000 g mol -1, and it gradually decreased with the increase in M n of HO-PBS-OH.

The experimental results showed that contents of cellulose, lignin and starch had a significant influence on the mechanical properties of composite films. The composite films showed relatively excellent mechanical properties in dry and wet states owing to the mutual property supplement of different components. The composite films were characterized via FT-IR, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM).

        "abstract": "A novel copolymer of chitosan-g-poly( p -dioxanone) (CGP) was synthesized in bulk by ring-opening polymerization of p -dioxanone (PDO) initiated by the hydroxyl group or amino group of chitosan using SnOct 2 as catalyst. The chemical structure was determined by 1 H NMR. It was found that the feed ratio of chitosan to PDO had a great effect on the degree of polymerization (DP) and the substitution (DS) of PDO. The thermal stability and crystallization behavior of graft copolymer CGP were closely related to the values of DP and DS. When the resulting copolymer was used as Ibuprofen carrier, the release rate of Ibuprofen decreased compared with that of pure chitosan carrier. The drug release behavior was also influenced by the structure of graft copolymers.",

        "abstract": "A novel binary flame-retardant system was formed by introducing aluminum hypophosphite (AP) and aluminum isobutylphosphinate (APBu) together for PA6. The optimum flame retardant formulation was 1:1 (AP:APBu, 15 wt % in total), and the resulting flame-retardant PA6 could achieve a LOI value of 28.3 vol % and UL-94 V-0 rating. Cone calorimeter testing showed the samples containing binary flame retardants became less flammable with lower peak heat release rate (PHRR, 259 kW/m2). Dynamic oscillatory rheology and simultaneous thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry results proved that cross-linking reactions existed in the samples containing AP. Morphology of the char layers was analyzed via SEM and laser Raman spectroscopy, and the results demonstrated the samples containing both AP and APBu formed more effective char. These results revealed that flame-retardant synergism existed between AP and APBu when they were combined to flame retard PA6. Consequently, a brief synergistic mechanism in this system was proposed. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA) is a biobased polymer, and poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) is a semibiobased polymer. However, PLLA is biodegradable, and PTT is not. In this paper, their copolymers (PTHT-PLLA) are synthesized via chain-extension reaction of hydroxyl terminated poly(trimethylene-co- hexamethylene terephthalate) (PTHT-OH) and hydroxyl terminated poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA-OH) using toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) as a chain extender. The structures and molecular weights of PTHT-OH, PLLA-OH, and PTHT-PLLA were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The thermal, crystalline, and mechanical properties of PTHT-PLLA were further studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and tensile testing. The resulting PTHT-PLLA copolyesters went through a two-stage thermal decomposition behavior and showed two glass transition temperatures. The tensile testing results showed that PTHT-PLLA copolyesters have excellent flexibility with a strain of more than 300%, which is much higher than that of PLLA. The copolyesters are expected to have a better biodegradability than PTT. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

Its chemical structure was confirmed by FTIR. The thermal gravimetrical analysis (TGA) showed that P(DOPO-VTES) had good thermal stability and a high of char yield (86.31%) at 700\u00a0\u00b0C in nitrogen atmosphere. Its XRD patterns showed that this compound had a certain ordered structure. P(DOPO-VTES) was blended with polycarbonate (PC) together with montmorillonite(MMT) to prepare a series of organic-inorganic hybrids of flame retardant (PC)/P(DOPO-VTES)/MMT via melt blending. The thermal degradation behavior and flame retardancy of those hybrids were investigated with TGA, limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94), and cone calorimeter. The LOI value of the flame-retardant PC systems could reach a maximal value of 32.8 when the content of P(DOPO-VTES) was 5 wt%. When 2 wt% MMT was added into the PC/5%P(DOPO-VTES) system, the UL-94 rating reached V-0. The possible flame retardant mode of MMT was studied via the dynamic rheological properties of the systems and the morphology of the chars remaining after the LOI test and the cone calorimeter test.",

        "abstract": "This manuscript reports a new method to solve the conflict between the flame retardance and anti-dripping of poly(ethylene terephthalate) by introducing azobenzene groups into the main-chain. This novel polyester containing azobenzene units in the main chain (PEAT) was synthesized via esterification and copolycondensation of terephthalic acid, ethylene glycol and azobenzene-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylic acid. TG-DSC, rheological and UV-Vis results proved the occurrence of the thermal and chemical crosslinking reaction by adjacent azobenzene groups. In the TG test, the residue and thermooxidative stability were obviously increased by the high-temperature crosslinking of the azobenzene groups. The cone calorimetric analysis and LOI tests further confirmed the self-extinguishing properties and inhibition of melt-dripping. Elemental analysis results indicated that besides partial decomposition of azobenzene groups into N2, most nitrogen was retained in the residue after high-temperature crosslinking. Besides, the char became more compact with an increase of azobenzene-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylic acid. All the results demonstrated that through the high-temperature crosslinking of the azobenzene group, PEAT exhibited a good balance between flame retardance and anti-dripping properties. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Increasing attention has recently been paid to the fabrication of drug delivery systems with excellent cell internalization and intracellular drug release properties. In this study, an amphiphilic block copolymer of chitosan was synthesized for the first time, which can self-assemble into micelles in a neutral aqueous solution but partially disassemble in an acidic endosomal/lysosomal environment. The antitumor drug, camptothecin (CPT), was encapsulated in the cores of the micelles for tumor cell therapy. In vitro drug release studies demonstrated that the micelles presented a much faster release of CPT at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.4. Blank micelles were found to be nontoxic in preliminary in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Cell experiments showed that the CPT-loaded micelles could be effectively internalized by Hela cells and accomplished a potent antitumor cell efficacy, indicating that the chitosan-based micelles might be an attractive new platform for efficient intracellular drug delivery.",

The copolymers were characterized by 1H-NMR, GPC, DSC and DMA. DSC analysis revealed that all PBSEGs prepared in this work are double-crystalline copolymers which ensure it to form separated crystalline domain determined the permanent shape and temporary shape respectively. The T m of PEG segment (T m,PEG) of the PBSEGs ranging from 27.54 to 51.04\u00b0C, acting as the transition temperature (T trans), was controllable by varying the chain length of soft segment. The DMA test indicated that a large difference in modulus below and above the T trans of PBSEGs endows it with sufficient deformability at high temperature and high capacity for keeping deformation at low temperature. The mechanical properties of the copolymer films were assessed by tensile strength measurement. It showed that the copolymers were ductile which enabled remarkable reversible deformation. The shape memory properties of PBSEGs were evaluated by bending test, as expected, most copolymers possessed excellent shape memory effect. The contact angle tests demonstrated that the copolymers were more hydrophilic with the introduction of PEG segment, suggesting this biodegradable PBSEG multiblock copolymer with excellent shape-memory properties has great potential in application for biomaterials. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

It was found that the PPDO content had great effect on the thermal transition behavior, crystallization ability and thermal stability of the graft co-polymer. The in vitro degradation rates of CDA-g-PPDO were higher than that of linear PPDO due to their lower crystallinity.

        "abstract": "As an extremely promising characteristic, the transformation between a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) has rarely been reported until now. In the present paper, a three-step strategy, based on \"grafting onto\" concept, was implemented to synthesize a novel thermoresponsive amphiphilic biodegradable and biocompatible poly(p-dioxanone)-grafted poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA-g-PPDO) copolymer with well-define structure. A transformable thermoresponsivity from a LCST to an UCST can be achieved facilely via changing the graft chain length of the resulting PVA-g-PPDO copolymers. The results of transmittance indicate that a wide range of LCST and UCST between 30 and 80 \u00b0 can be achieved easily, which is attributed to the controllable structures and hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio of copolymers by adjusting degree of polymerization (Dp) of PPDO prepolymers and molar feed ratios in the last esterification coupling step. This is the first example having the feature of architecture-determined different-type thermoresponsivities by a facile change of side chain length from an identical comb-like graft copolymer family, and displaying a wide range of controllable LCST and UCST. The influence of solution concentrations on thermoresponsivities has been investigated by UV-vis spectrometer, and the solution properties of copolymers have also been evaluated by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results show that the self-assembly of copolymers displaying different thermoresponsivities can be observed and regulated by changing the structure and temperature. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Three metal hypophosphites, including aluminum hypophosphite (AP), magnesium hypophosphite (MP), and calcium hypophosphite (CP), were applied to flame retard acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). Thermal stability of three flame-retardant ABS were evaluated, and the enhancement of thermal stability were found. Flammable properties of flame-retardant ABS were investigated by Underwriters Laboratories 94 vertical burning test (UL-94), limit oxygen index (LOI), and cone calorimetry. Results suggested that AP could endow the best flame retardance for ABS with a UL-94 V-0 rating and LOI value of 25.1%. The peak heat release rate of ABS-AP reduced to 174.8 kW/m2, and the total heat released was decreased to 40.9 MJ/m2. Thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR), FTIR, and scanning electron microcsopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDX) were used to characterize the gaseous products and condensed residue respectively. Results showed that the flame-retardant mechanism was attributed to the formation of a two-layer protective barrier consisting of an organic P-O-C char layer and an inorganic layer to insulate material from fire and oxygen in the condensed phase, and the generation of P? and PO? to capture the reactive radicals in the vapor phase. ? 2014 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A reactive extrusion technology was adopted to synthesize a flame retardant (ER), based on the esterification of melamine phosphate and pentaerythritol. The ER imparts good flame retardancy and non-dripping for polyethylene (PE) when combined with ammonium polyphosphate to yield an intumescent polyethylene (PE\u2013IFR). The performance of this intumescent system has been enhanced by the addition of small amounts (0.2%) chelated copper(II)salicylaldehyde (CuSA) and salicylaldoxime, (CuSAO). The thermal stabilization and burning behaviour of the flame retardant PE system have been investigated by TGA, LOI, the UL-94 test and cone calorimetry. All formulations studied provide good flame retardant behaviour, with LOI \u2265 27.4 and UL-94 V-0 rating. The onset of decomposition in TGA for flame retarded PE (PE\u2013IFR, PE\u2013IFR\u2013CuSA and PE\u2013IFR\u2013CuSAO) commences at lower temperature than that of PE with release of blowing agent, but continues to a higher temperature, leaving a greater residue. Significant differences have been observed in burning behaviour using cone calorimetry, between flame retarded PE (PE\u2013IFR, PE\u2013IFR\u2013CuSA and PE\u2013IFR\u2013CuSAO) and PE, showing decreases in HRR, PHRR, MLR, FIGRA and CO emission.

The intrinsic viscosity was increased with the increase of tssp, but decreased with the increase of CEPPA content. The sequence distribution of resultant copolyesters was analyzed by 1H NMR. It was found that the randomness of copolyesters was decreased after SSP, and the transesterification occurred mainly at the ester bonds formed by CEPPA and EG, resulting in the chain growth. DSC results showed that SSP treatment was favorable to enhance the crystallization ability of the obtained copolyesters. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A hyperbranched polyamine charring agent (HPCA) containing triazine was prepared by using 4,4\u2032-oxybisbenzenamine and cyanuric trichloride through A 2 + B 3 approach. The structure and thermal stability of the product were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry ( 1H NMR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It is shown that the carbonaceous residue at 700\u00b0C is higher than 60 wt% suggesting a good char forming ability. Intumescent flame retarded acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (IFR-ABS) was prepared with HPCA and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) via melt blending. The flame retardance and thermal properties of the IFR-ABS were studied through limited oxygen index (LOI) and UL-94 vertical burning. The thermal degradation and char forming behaviour was tested with TGA and the morphology of char layer was observed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that a good synergistic effect is present between HPCA and APP. The calculated carbonaceous residue at 800\u00b0C is 24.3 wt%, however the experimental value is 49.7 wt%, which is twice the former. Furthermore, the HPCA and APP have a promoting effect for char forming of IFR-ABS during combustion, for example, there is little carbonaceous residue for ABS at 550\u00b0C according to TGA results in air, but there is 18.4 wt% carbonaceous residue for IFR-ABS with 25 wt% flame retardants. Moreover, the LOI for IFR-ABS is improved to 26.9 from 18.0 for ABS, and UL-94 V-0 rating is achieved with 30 wt% flame retardants. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The morphology and burning behaviour of nanocomposite with 2\u00a0wt% Zn-Al-LDH loadings were investigated. The extent of dispersion of LDH was quantified by wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), illuminating the good dispersion state for ZnAl-LDH in the PLA matrix. Significant improvements in fire retardant performance were observed for the nanocomposite from microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC) and cone calorimetry (reducing both the heat release rate and the total heat released). It revealed that incorporation of FR and ZnAl-LDH was very efficient in improving the flame retardance of PLA composite.",

Etching technology was used to study lamellar morphologies of ring-banded spherulites and distinct images of twisting lamellae in crystalline PTT and PTT-co-PLA were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Comparing with PTT homopolymer, ring-banded spherulites in PTT-co-PLA have much smaller band spacing and the band spacing decreases sharply with the increase of PLA segments content. It was confirmed by experiments that there are 2-fold reasons for the sharp decrease of band spacing in PTT-co-PLA ring-banded spherulites. First, the unbalanced surface stress at the fold surfaces for the PTT lamellar twisting can be intensified by amorphous PLA segments. Second, the thickness of PTT lamellae decreases with the increase of PLA segments content. Both changes significantly enhance the helical twisting frequency of twisted lamellae. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

The ring-opening polymerization of p-dioxanone (PDO) using stannous octoate (SnOct2) as a catalyst was conducted at 125\u00b0C for 3 h, and then a certain amount of HDI was added into the reactive system to react with the resulting PPDO prepolymer for an additional 30 min. The effect of the weight ratio of HDI to PPDO on the molecular weight of the chain-extended PPDO has been studied, and the results show that when the ratio is 0.78 wt%, higher molecular weight PPDO can be obtained, demonstrating that HDI is an effective extender for PPDO. The thermal degradation behaviors of PPDO and chain-extended polymer (PPDO-HDI) in air have been investigated by TG. The results show that the thermal stability of PPDO-HDI is higher than that of PPDO. Differntial scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide angle X-ray diffractometry (WXRD) have been utilized to investigate the crystallization behavior of PPDO-HDI and PPDO. There exists no obvious difference between the crystal structures of PPDO-HDI and PPDO, however, the crystallinity of PPDO-HDI decreases to 33% from 60% of PPDO; the melting point of PPDO-HDI decreases a little and its glass transition temperature increases compared with those of PPDO. Moreover, the tensile strength and the elongation at break of PPDO-HDI are 36 MPa and 464%, respectively, almost the same as those of PPDO.",

PPDO terminated with the isocyanate group was allowed to react with hydroxyl groups of the N-phthaloyl-protected chitosan, and then the phthaloyl group was cleaved to give the free amino groups. The length of PPDO graft chains can be controlled easily by using the prepolymers of PPDO with different molecular weights. The resulting products were thoroughly characterized with FT-IR, (1)H NMR, TG, DSC, SEM, and WAXD. The copolymers were used as drug carriers for sinomenine (7,8-didehydro-4-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxy-17-methyl-9alpha,13alpha,14alpha-morphinan-6-one) and these exhibited a significant controlled drug-releasing behavior whether in artificial gastric juice or in neutral phosphate buffer solution.",

The effect of PCD on the thermal stability and crystallization of PPDO was investigated by using non-isothermal thermalgravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy (POM) and wide angle X-ray diffractometry (WAXD). It has been shown that the addition of PCD can enhance significantly the thermal stability of PPDO. The thermal decomposition temperature of PPDO increases with the increase of the amount of PCD added. The activation energies for non-isothermal thermal degradation estimated by Kissinger method are 160 and 106 kJ mol -1 for PPDO added with 5wt% PCD and neat PPDO respectively. The results obtained from DSC and POM indicate that PCD plays a role of nucleating agent in the process of crystallization of PPDO.

        "abstract": "A rapid and \"green\" synthesis of poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO)/montmorillonite (MMT) nanocomposites was carried out smoothly and effectively nder constant microwave powers of 30, 60, 90, and 120 W in a microwave oven at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. The temperature of polymerization was in the range 103-224\u00b0C. PPDO, with a viscosity-average molecular weight of 111,000 g/mol and a conversion of 85%, was obtained at 60 W for 10 min, in which the ratio of p-dioxanone to AlEt 3 was 300/1 (mol/mol). The intercalated structure of PPDO/MMT nanocomposites was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Thermogravimetry data showed that the thermal stability of the nanocomposites prepared under microwave irradiation was improved with respect to those prepared via conventional heating.

        "abstract": "Nanofibers of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/layered double hydroxide (Mg-Al LDH) composites are prepared by the electrostatic fiber spinning using water as the solvent at a high voltage of 21 kV. Either inorganic LDH carbonate (LDH-CO 3) or L-lactic acid-modified LDH (Lact-LDH) is used for incorporating with PVA. Scanning electron microscopy SEM investigations on the nanofibers suggest that the average diameters of PVA/LDH composite fibers are smaller than that of neat PVA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations indicate that the dispersity of the LDH in PVA matrix is much improved after modification with L-lactic acid. The mechanical properties of the PVA/LDH fibers are obviously enhanced compared to that of neat PVA. For example, the tensile stress and elongation at break of the PVA/Lact-LDH electrospun fibrous mat with 5 wt % Lact-LDH are 31.7 MPa and 36.7%, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of neat PVA, and also higher than those of PVA/LDH-CO 3 owing to the better dispersity of Lact-LDH nanoparticles.

Different integral and differential methods were used to compare with this value. Also, the experimental results were compared to master curve plots in the range of Doyle approximations. Analysis of experimental results suggests that in the range of conversions studied, 5\u201320%, the actual RM is D 3 type, which is three-dimensional diffusion.

The thermogravimetric analysis of PPDO shows that the increase of molecular weights can improve the thermal stability of PPDO. The rheological property of PPDO with different molecular weights has been investigated using a Capillary Rheometer. The results show that PPDO exhibits a shear-thinning behavior; the apparent viscosity of melt increases with the molecular weight of PPDO and is very sensitive to temperature, decreasing sharply with the rise of temperature. In vitro degradation of PPDO films has also been carried out and excellent degradability has been found.

Four-arm star-shaped poly(p-dioxanone) (4s-PPDO) precursor with hydroxyl terminal group was prepared by ring-opening polymerization of PDO using stannous 2-ethylhexanoate [Sn(Oct)2] as a catalyst and pentaerythritol (PTOL) as initiator. Amphiphilic PPDO-b-PEG conetworks were prepared by directly coupling reaction of the hydroxyl group terminated 4s-PPDO and PEG precursors using toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate (TDI) as chain extender. The influences of molecular structure, type of solvents on the swelling ratio of the amphiphilic PPDO-b-PEG conetworks were studied. The co-continuity of the conetworks was characterized via swelling in chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and H2O, respectively, and the results show that amphiphilic PPDO-b-PEG polymer networks had different swelling behaviors in different solvents, which were determined by the dosage of coupling agent and feed ratio of PPDO/PEG. The crystalline behaviors of copolymers were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results indicated that compositions of PPDO and PEG and the degree of crosslinking, which were obtained by using various amount of TDI, had an important influence on the thermal and crystalline behaviors such as melting temperature (Tm) , crystallizing temperature (Tc) , melting enthalpy (\u0394Hm), crystallizing enthalpy( \u0394H c), and degree of crystallinity. The crosslinking structure limited the crystallization of PEG segments, resulting in decreased relative degree of crystallization and crystal size.",

There were two crystallization exotherms - a major exotherm between 25 \u00b0C and 50 \u00b0C and a minor one almost unchanged at 77 \u00b0C with various heating rates - in the heating scans of PPDO during nonisothermal cold crystallization. Temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC) revealed the major crystallization exotherm in the low-temperature range to be the real cold crystallization peak, and the minor one in the high-temperature range to be the melt-recrystallization peak of crystals with lower thermal stability. Several methods, including the Avrami, Tobin, and Ozawa equations, were employed to analyze the nonisothermal cold crystallization kinetics of PPDO. The efficiencies of the Avrami and Tobin methods were compared, and the results suggest that the Avrami equation is more suitable for describing nonisothermal cold crystallization kinetics of PPDO. The activation energy for nonisothermal cold crystallization of PPDO was calculated to be 35.27 kJ/mol, using the Kissinger method. In addition, the Avrami equation was also used to describe the isothermal cold crystallization kinetics of PPDO. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "The combination of two modification techniques developed for the ZSM-5 zeolite, i.e., desilication and incorporation of lanthanum under microwave irradiation, has produced a highly efficient catalyst, DeLaZSM-5, for catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Its performance on the degradation was studied at 390\u00a0\u00b0C and compared with the parent ZSM-5 and the modified intermediate products desilicated ZSM-5 (DeZSM-5) and LaZSM-5. Among the catalysts tested, DeLaZSM-5 showed the highest catalytic degradation rate. In addition, on DeLaZSM-5 the liquid yield was slightly increased and the isoparaffin index of the liquid was almost doubled, which indicated higher liquid quality compared with the parent ZSM-5 zeolite. The high catalytic activity of DeLaZSM-5 could be explained by its unique acidic properties with a sharp increase of the number and strength of weak acid sites and a decrease of strong acid sites.",

        "abstract": "An inherently flame-retardant poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was synthesized via the chain-extending reactions of dihydroxyl terminated pre-poly(lactic acid) (pre-PLA), which was synthesized by direct polycondensation of l-lactic acid using 1,4-butanediol as initiator and stannous chloride (SnCl2) as catalyst, using ethyl phosphorodichloridate as chain extender. The resulting phosphorus-containing poly(lactic acid) (PPLA) was characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), 1H and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 31P NMR) and homonuclear correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and inductively coupled plasma-mass (ICP). A comprehensive flame retardant property of PPLA was evaluated by microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC), limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94) and cone calorimeter test (CCT). PPLA has excellent flame retardancy and also can be used as a flame retardant for commercial PLA. Only 5 wt.% of PPLA added into PLA can obtain good flame retardant properties. As the content of PPLA is further increased to 10 wt.%, PLA can have much better flame retardancy (LOI = 35 and UL-94 V-0 rating), lower peak heat release rate (pHRR) and longer ignition time (TTI) than neat PLA. All those results mean that this novel approach to impart flame retardancy to PLA is very effective. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The effects of organoclay on the thermal properties and melting behaviors of the nanocomposites were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The flammability of the nanocomposites was characterized by the limiting oxygen index test and the UL-94 vertical test. The results showed that a small amount of organoclay was able to improve the thermal stabilities and the flame retardancy of PET- co -HPPPA copolyesters, and however there was no significant increase in the melting points of nanocomposites when the content of diethylene glycol was controlled as a certain value. The overall crystallization rate of the nanocomposites is greater than that of neat copolyester. The nanocomposites have better flame retardancy than PET- co -HPPPA.",

The photo-oxidative degradation of PPDO was performed in air under ultraviolet light with two kinds of wavelength 365.0 nm and 253.7 nm. The extent of photo-oxidative degradation of the polymer was determined by morphological analysis, weight loss ratio, changes of viscosity and scanning electron microscope method (SEM). Infrared spectrometry (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method were used to infer the mechanism of the photo-oxidative degradation. The changes of glass-transition temperature (T g) and melting temperature (Tm) were characterized by differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) test. The morphological examination, IR and NMR testing revealed that the extent and mechanism of photooxidative degradation for PPDO are not closely correlated with its initial molecular weight. The main influence of initial molecular weight on the degradation is to change the ultimate distribution of the molecular weight. The conclusion is supported by the results of DSC test. All results from the research show the excellent photodegradable property of PPDO. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Firstly, multi-branched PPDO was prepared via polycondensation of AB2-type HOOC-PPDO-2OH precursor, which was synthesized by using 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid as initiator for ring opening polymerization of p-dioxanone; then the multi-branched PPDO-b-PEG copolymer was obtained by coupling the end hydroxyl group of multi-branched PPDO with carboxylated mPEG using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as dehydrator. The molecular structures of polymers formed in each step were characterized by NMR and GPC. The results confirmed the successful preparation of the target product, and the molecular characteristics of the multi-branched PPDO, such as chain length of the blocks and branch density, could be facilely controlled. In addition, the micelle of the copolymer in aqueous solution was investigated by fluorescent probe, TEM, DLS, DSC and NMR. The results indicated that the copolymer in aqueous solution can form \"star anise\"-like micelles and the micellization behavior was determined by the composition and molecular architecture of the copolymer.

The PEUs were further studied by the means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and tensile testing. The data of GPC analysis indicated that high molecular weights for example more than 200 000 g \u00b7mol-1 were easily synthesized through chain-extension reaction.

        "abstract": "A novel phosphorus-containing thermotropic liquid crystalline copolyester with aromatic ether moiety (TLCP-AE) was used to prepare the in situ composites of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/liquid crystalline polymer. The morphological structure and properties of PET/TLCP-AE in situ composites were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), capillary rheometer, tensile tests, limiting oxygen index tests (LOI), cone calorimeter and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The rheological measurements show that the viscosity ratio of TLCP-AE to PET at 260 \u00b0C is less than 1, which meets a precondition for TLCP-AE to form fibrils in PET matrix during processing. The mechanical, LOI and cone tests prove that TLCP-AE can improve the mechanical properties and flame retardancy of PET synchronously. Moreover, TGA results exhibit that the initial decomposition temperatures and the final residues of PET/TLCP-AE composites increase with increasing TLCP-AE content. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The existence of the interactions shows the miscibility of PET and PSPPP. PET/PSPPP flame-retardant systems have a very high thermal stability, and do not decompose at the processing temperature of PET. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) values of the systems increase with the content of PSPPP, and are almost not affected by the molecular weights of PSPPP and the blending methods. At the processing temperatures of PET, PSPPP with lower molecular weights, say Mn >4 000, will cause the degradation of PET, which can be to a certain extent inhibited by adding a stabilizer to the systems. As the results of those, the apparent viscosities of PET/PSPPP systems with lower molecular weights of PSPPP are higher than those with higher molecular weights of PSPPP. The addition of the stabilizer can decrease their viscosity differences. The apparent viscosities of various PET/PSPPP systems decrease with the increase of shear rate and the content of PSPPP, and do with the rise of temperature.",

For the resultant composites of graphene and polylactide, the compatibilizer showed positive effects of enhancing crystallization, thermal stability and mechanical property of the composites. Moreover, electrical conductivity of the polymer matrix was greatly increased with the incorporation of graphene, and the addition of the compatibilizer did not cause an obvious change in the electrical conductivity of the resultant composites. The results implied that the compatibilizer, which was obtained by the simple and facile synthetic strategy presented herein, had great potential in the field of composites based on polymer and carbon allotropes. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "A novel inorganic compound, aluminum hypophosphite (AP), was synthesized successfully and applied as a flame retardant to glass-fiber-reinforced polyamide 6 (GF-PA6). The thermal stability and burning behaviors of the GF-PA6 samples containing AP (flame-retardant GF-PA6) were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis, vertical burning testing (with a UL-94 instrument), limiting oxygen index (LOI) testing, and cone calorimeter testing (CCT). The thermogravimetric data indicated that the addition of AP decreased the onset decomposition temperatures, the maximum mass loss rate (MLR), and the maximum-rate decomposition temperature of GF-PA6 and increased the residue chars of the samples. Compared with the neat GF-PA6, the AP-containing GF-PA6 samples had obviously improved flame retardancy: the LOI value increased from 22.5 to 30.1, and the UL-94 rating went from no rating to V-0 (1.6 mm) when the AP content increased from 0 to 25 wt % in GF-PA6. The results of CCT reveal that the heat release rate, total heat release, and MLR of the AP-containing GF-PA6 samples were lower than those of GF-PA6. Furthermore, the higher additive amount of AP affected the mechanical properties of GF-PA6, but they remained acceptable. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The fire performance of the treated PP is investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94) and cone calorimeter, and the thermal stability and thermal oxidative stability of the composites are studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TG). It has been found that the treated PP with the optimal flame retardant formulation of APP:MP:BCPPS = 12:6:12 (weight ratio, formulation 10) gives an LOI of 31.3 and UL-94 V-0 rating. The results from cone calorimeter indicate that both the heat release rate (HRR) and the total heat evolved (THE) of IFR-PP (formulation 10) decrease significantly compared with those of neat PP. The TG result shows that the IFR-PP (formulation 10) has a high yield of residual char at high temperature. FTIR is used to investigate the residue of the treated PP that degrades at 400\u00b0C for different time. The compact outer surface and the shaggy inner surface can be observed from the SEM graph of the residual chars after LOI test, which form a much better barrier for the transfer of heat and fuel during combustion and show good flame retardancy. Moreover, the treated PP and its residue are investigated by XPS analysis. \u00a9 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

        "abstract": "We developed a novel method for preparing poly(ethylene terephthalate)/BaSO 4 nanocomposites, which were synthesized by in situ polymerization of terephthalic acid (TPA), ethylene glycol (EG) and BaSO 4 nanoparticles prepared by reacting H 2 SO 4 with Ba(OH) 2 in ethylene glycol (EG). It was shown that the addition of BaSO 4 would not influence the synthesis of PET. The structure of the nanocomposites was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the nanoscale dispersion of BaSO 4 particles in the PET matrix was observed when the BaSO 4 content is below 4 wt%. Moreover, the thermal properties of the nanocomposites were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results suggest that the degree of dispersion of BaSO 4 particles in the PET matrix has important effect on the thermal properties of the nanocomposites. The existence of BaSO 4 nanoparticles enhances the crystallization rate of PET. Besides, it was found that the thermal stability of PET was improved by the addition of the BaSO 4 nanoparticles.",

The isothermal crystallization kinetics study suggests that incorporation of PEGS component did not change the crystallization mechanism, but reduced the crystallization rate of the samples, and that increasing crystallization temperature decreased the crystallization rate of all the samples. The spherulites of neat PBS and P(BS-b-PEGS) showed banded morphologies. The spherulitic growth rate of the samples also decreased with increase of PEGS content and crystallization temperature. A transition from crystallization regime II to III occurred for all the samples, and the transition shifted to lower temperatures with increase in PEGS content. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Long-chain-branched poly( p -dioxanone)s (LCB-PPDOs) with different branch densities were prepared via the chain-extending reaction of hydroxyl group terminated linear bi-functional PPDO (2a-PPDO) and star-like tri-functional PPDO (3a-PPDO) prepolymers, which were synthesized by the ring-opening polymerization of p -dioxanone (PDO) using 1,4-butanediol (BD) and trimethylolpropane (TMP) as multi-functional initiators, respectively. The undesirable gelation was successfully depressed by adjusting the chain length and feed ratio of prepolymers. The average molecular weight between branch points ( M b ) and the average number of branch per 100,000 g/mol ( B n ) of LCB-PPDOs were calculated from the 1 H NMR spectra. The average number of branch ranged from 0 to 6.72 branch points per 100,000 g/mol, and the number-average molecular weights between branch points ranged from 6900 to 20,500 g/mol. The results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the crystallization behavior of LCB-PPDOs was changed evidently with the branch density. Small-amplitude dynamic oscillatory rheometer was used to investigate the rheological properties of the melts of LCB-PPDO including zero-shear viscosity, storage modulus, relaxation times and loss angle, which largely depended on the branch density and length of LCB-PPDOs. Therefore, the rheological behaviors of PPDO can be well-controlled via synthesizing LCB-PPDOs with the desired architectures. Keywords Long-chain-branch Poly( p -dioxanone) Chain-extending Rheology 1 Introduction As a biodegradable polyether ester, poly( p -dioxanone) (PPDO) has attracted many attentions because of its special characters. The coexistence of ester and ether bonds in polymer chains endues PPDO with both excellent biodegradability and flexibility [1] . Compared to other well reported biodegradable aliphatic polyesters, such as polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), poly( \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), PPDO not only have good mechanical strength (tensile strength > 30 MPa), but also have excellent flexibility (elongation at break > 300%) and proper melting temperature (110 \u00b0C). The PPDO has already been used in some biomedical applications such as suture, bone repair device and may have potential applications in peroral or parenteral drug delivery systems. With the decrease of its monomer cost, PPDO also may be used in universal uses, such as films, molded products, laminates, foams, non-woven material, adhesives and coatings [1\u20133] . However, the linear PPDO, which has relatively low melt strength, is very hard to thermoform in common thermoplastic processing, especially foaming and blow molding. Introducing long-chain branches to linear polymer is an effective approach to increase the melt strength [4\u20136] . A long-chain-branch (LCB) is long enough to entangle with other chains in melt and concentrated solutions, thereby altering the flow properties. The LCB polymers were found to exhibit the following properties: lower Newtonian viscosity and stronger shear thinning than a linear polymer of equal molecular weight, strong melt elasticity expressed by the first normal stress difference and storage modulus, and enhanced strain hardening under elongational flow [7,8] . Various types of branched polyesters such as star-branched, comb-like, randomly branched and super-branched polyesters, were prepared using different polymerization techniques [4,9\u201312] . The strategies of preparation of these LCB-polyesters were based on the co-polycondensation of multi-functional (>2) monomer with bi-functional monomer. Hess et al. [11] changed the level of random branching in PET by adding different levels of trimethylolpropane (TMP) to the melt polymerization, and the branched PET possessed a lower zero-shear viscosity compared to linear chains of equal M w . Kim et al. [12] prepared long branched polybutylene succinate (PBS) by introducing a branching agent, trimethylol propane (TMP), to the polycondensation system of succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol, and observed an increased shear-thinning extent and decreased loss tangent as the level of tri-functional branching agent was increased. For those polyesters, such as PET and PBS, prepared by polycondensation reactions, the LCB structure is relatively easy to obtain by introducing a certain amount of multi-functional monomer. However, to the best of our knowledge, no attempt about the preparation of those LCB-aliphatic polyesters obtained by ring-opening polymerization of lactone or lactide, such as PCL, PLA and PPDO, was reported, probably because it was very hard to obtain the multi-functional cyclic monomer for ring-opening polymerization. The aim of this work is to synthesize long-chain-branched poly( p -dioxanone) (LCB-PPDO) so as to improve the rheological and processing properties of PPDO. A relatively facile synthesis strategy was adopted to prepare LCB-PPDO. Firstly, trimethylolpropane (TMP) was used as initiator and SnOct 2 as a catalyst to initiate the ring-opening polymerization of PDO, given the star-shaped tri-hydroxyl-terminated poly( p -dioxanone) (3a-PPDO) prepolymer [13] . Then LCB-PPDOs with different branch density were synthesized via the reaction between the terminated hydroxyl groups of prepolymer using hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as the chain-extending agent, which has the low toxicity of its degradation products and high reactive activation for \u2013OH groups [14] . Compared to those traditional methods preparing branched polyesters, the coupling reaction of functional terminated prepolymer could produce LCB polymer with relatively short time and high efficiency. Moreover, the molecular structure of LCB polymer could also be easily controlled by adjusting the chain length of prepolymers. To depress the probability of gelation, linear bi-hydroxyl-terminated PPDO prepolymer was introduced to the chain-extending reaction. The influence of the molecular topology on the rheological and crystallization behaviors of the LCB-PPDOs was discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The monomer of PPDO, p -dioxanone, was provided by the Pilot Plant of the Center for Degradable and Flame-Retardant Polymeric Materials (Chengdu, China) and purified by vacuum distillation from CaH 2 . SnOct 2 was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA) and used as received. 1,4-Butanediol (BD) was purchased from Zhiyuan Chemical Company (Tianjin, China) and used after vacuum distillation for three times. Trimethylolpropane (TMP) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd. and used without further purification. Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. and used without further purification. 2.2 Preparation of 2a-PPDO prepolymer and 3a-PPDO prepolymer The polymerization of PDO was performed in a flame-dried and argon-purged glass reactor with magnetic stirring. Firstly, a certain amount of TMP was put into different reactors, into which BD was injected with a syringe. Then, the PDO monomer was injected into the reactors after repeated evacuation and purging with argon several times, and the reactors were immersed into an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C with stirring for 30 min. The polymerization was conducted for 48 h after certain amount of the SnOct 2 /toluene solution was injected into the reactors. The reactors were rapidly cooled to room temperature via ice cooling after reaction and the product was shattered with crushing machine. 2.3 Preparation of LCB-PPDO via chain extending Scheme 1 illustrates the reaction mechanism of forming LCB-PPDO polymers via the reaction between the terminated hydroxyl group of prepolymers and NCO group of HDI. In this work, three pairs of the prepolymers with different lengths of chains were used ( Table 1 ). 3a-PPDO prepolymer (10 g) and 2a-PPDO prepolymer (10 g) were put into a dried glass reactor. The reactor was rigorously dried by evacuating and purging with argon several times prior to immerse into a temperature-adjusted silicone oil bath. HDI was injected with a syringe while stirring after the prepolymers were melted completely and commixed uniformity. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h under argon until the intrinsic viscosity were not raised and then rapidly cooled to room temperature via ice cooling after reaction. The crude products were grinding milled to powder and then soxhlet-extracted by using aceton (containing 1% of ethanol) as solvent for more than 48 h, followed by drying in 50 \u00b0C vacuum oven until constant weight reached. The unreacted \u2013NCO groups were then removed or terminated before the characterization. 2.4 Characterization and test The number-average molecular weight ( M n ) and molecular weight distribution (MWD, M w / M n ) of prepolymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Waters 1515 isocratic HPLC pump, Waters 717 plus autosampler, Waters 2414 refractive index detector) at 30 \u00b0C with a calibration curve constructed using polystyrene (PSt) standards. Chloroform was used as solvent and eluent with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The intrinsic viscosity [ \u03b7 ] was measured in phenol/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (1:1 v/v) solution using an Ubbelohde viscometer maintained at 30 \u00b0C. 1 H NMR spectra (400 MHz) and 13 C NMR spectra (100 MHz) were recorded by a Varian Inova 400 NMR Spectrometer using deuterated chloroform (CDCl 3 ) for prepolymer and deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide ( d 6 -DMSO) for LCB-PPDO as solvent. All the samples were packed with filter paper and then Soxhlet extracted in boiling acetone for 48 h before test. DSC measurement was performed with TA Q200 (TA instruments, USA) in sealed aluminum pan under nitrogen atmosphere. The samples were cooled to \u221250 \u00b0C from room temperature, and then heated to 140 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min, kept for 5 min to eliminate the thermal history, then cooled to \u221250 \u00b0C at a cooling rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. The samples were again heated up to 140 \u00b0C at the same rate. X-ray diffraction patterns were taken on a Philips X\u2019Pert X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. Rheological measurements were performed on a rotational rheometer, Gemini 200HR (Bohlin Instruments, UK) using a heated stream of nitrogen gas for temperature control. All measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and 25 mm parallel plates with gap slightly exceeding 1 mm were used. Samples were formed into 25 mm disks by compression-molding. Small-amplitude oscillatory shear was performed in the frequency range of 0.01\u2013100 rad/s at 120 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation and characterization of PPDO prepolymers The prepolymers, hydroxyl-terminated linear bi-functional PPDO (2a-PPDO) and star-shaped tri-functional PPDO (3a-PPDO) prepolymers, were prepared by using 1,4-butanediol (BD) and trimethylolpropane (TMP) as an initiator, respectively, and SnOct 2 as a catalyst. Hydroxyl groups reacted with catalyst, stannous octate (Sn(Oct) 2 ), to co-initiate the ring-opening polymerization of PDO monomer. Therefore, the length of chain can be controlled by changing the molar ratios of PDO/initiator [15] . All the samples were prepared at 150 \u00b0C for 1 h. The molecular characteristics of prepolymers are listed in Table 1 . The results clearly indicated that the molecular weights increased with the feed molar ratio of PDO to initiators. 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ) was used to learn the detailed information on the microstructure of 2a-PPDO and 3a-PPDO. Resonances located at \u03b4 H a 4.1 ppm, \u03b4 H b 3.8 ppm, \u03b4 H c 4.2 ppm were assigned to the three methylene hydrogen atoms of PPDO, respectively. The signals occurring at \u03b4 H h 1.7 ppm and \u03b4 H q 4.05 ppm were assigned to the methylene protons of BD in 2a-PPDO. The signal occurring at \u03b4 H f 0.88 ppm was assigned to the methyl protons of reacted TMP in 3a-PPDO. The signals of 3a-PPDO at \u03b4 H g 1.5 ppm, \u03b4 H e 4.07 ppm and \u03b4 H e\u2019 3.45 ppm were assigned to the methene groups connected with methyl, ester, and hydroxyl groups, respectively ( Fig. 1 ). The resonance at \u03b4 H e\u2019 3.45 ppm suggested that the uncompleted esterification of hydroxyl groups of TMP. The number-average molecular weights of the prepolymers derived from different methods were listed in Table 1 . It was found that the M n \u2032 calculated by NMR was less than theoretical value ( M n \u2033) among all the different ratios of PDO/OH, which was caused by unreacted monomer. The M n obtained from GPC measurement was the highest among three different methods. Similar trend was reported for some other aliphatic polyester such as PLLA and PBS [16] . 3.2 Synthesis of LCB-PPDOs The detail approach of synthesis of LCB-PPDO was described above and outlined in Scheme 1 . All the samples were prepared at 150 \u00b0C for 60 min and HDI was used as the chain-extending agent. Since the resulted long-chain branch structure could be controlled by adjusting the molecular weight of prepolymers [17] , three pairs of the prepolymers with different chain lengths were used for preparing LCB-PPDO with different molecular structure. Theoretically, the chain-extending reaction of prepolymer with tri-functional terminal groups may result in gelation of final products [18] . The probability of gelation depends directly on the concentration of the tri-functional terminal groups in the reaction system. Therefore, to avoid the gelation by decreasing the concentration of tri-functional terminal groups, bi-functional prepolymer 2a-PPDO with different molecular weight and contents were added. The relationship between intrinsic viscosity [ \u03b7 ] of products and the feed ratios of \u2013NCO/\u2013OH were also studied. Although the molecular weight can not be calculated from the data of intrinsic viscosity due to the existence of LCB structure, it was still a good way to compare the magnitude of molecular weight among them. And the number of terminated hydroxyl groups of prepolymers was equal to the number of hydroxyl groups of initiators. The products were dissolved in phenol/1,1,2,2,-tetrachloroethane (1:1/v:v) to determine whether the gelation occurred. The results are presented in Fig. 2 . For those prepolymer with high molecular weight, no gelation was observed in the whole range of \u2013NCO/\u2013OH ratio. The intrinsic viscosities of LCB-PPDOs increased with the increase of \u2013NCO/\u2013OH ratio firstly, but after reached the maximum value, when the \u2013NCO/\u2013OH ratio was slightly higher than the 1:1, the intrinsic viscosity of LCB-40s and LCB-60s decreased with the addition of more HDI. These results are in good accordance with those of reported for chain-extending reaction of linear PPDO [15] . The excess HDI may act as terminated agent, which decreased the concentration of hydroxyl groups. For branched polymer, not only the molecular weight but also the branch density has important influence on the intrinsic viscosity ([ \u03b7 ]). The branched polymer had lower [ \u03b7 ] than the linear polymer with similar molecular weight, and this deviation increased with the branch density [17] . In this work, because of the introduction of linear bi-functional prepolymer 2a-PPDO, the branch density of the resulting products was relatively low compared to those of common branched polymer. The increase in [ \u03b7 ] of LCB-PPDO attributed to the increase of molecular weight overwhelm the decrease of [ \u03b7 ] attributed to increase of branch density. Therefore, the [ \u03b7 ] of LCB-PPDO showed similar changing trend as those of chain-extending reaction of linear bi-functional polymers using isocyanate as extender [15] . For prepolymer with low molecular weight (2a-20/3a-20), gelation was observed when the HDI/OH ratio higher than 1:1. When more 2a-PPDO was added, the minimum \u2013NCO/\u2013OH ratio at which the gelation occurred also increased obviously. This phenomenon was attributed to the changes in concentration of tri-functional terminal hydroxyl groups. The prepolymer with shorter chain length or higher content of 3a-PPDO have higher concentration of tri- functional terminal hydroxyl groups and therefore have higher probability of gelation. Therefore, it is an effective way to avoid the gelation by adjusting the concentration of tri-functional terminal hydroxyl groups. 3.3 Molecular structure of LCB-PPDO The 1 H NMR (DMSO, 400 MHz) spectroscopy of LCB-PPDO was shown in Fig. 3 (a). Besides the three typical signals ascribed to PPDO units ( \u03b4 H a 4.16 ppm, \u03b4 H b 3.76 ppm, \u03b4 H c 4.21 ppm) and the signals ascribed to TMP ( \u03b4 H f 0.88) and BD ( \u03b4 H h 1.68) units, the weak single peaks at 7.18 ppm ( \u03b4 H m ) and 1.26 ppm, 1.43 ppm, 2.98 ppm are ascribed to the amide \u2013NH groups and methylene protons of HDI ( Fig. 3 a), suggesting that the prepolymers were successfully coupled by HDI. Weak resonances of PDO monomer were found in the NMR spectra of LCB-PPDO, suggesting that a trace amount of PDO monomer was formed by the unzipping reaction of PPDO [19] during the chain-extending reaction at 150 \u00b0C. Since the amount of monomer was relatively small, it did not show obvious impact on the properties of the samples. 13 C NMR spectrum of LCB-PPDO was shown in Fig. 3 (b). The peak at 68.9, 72.6, 74.4 and 175.4 ppm are assigned to carbons of methene groups and carbonyl group PPDO, respectively. The resonance of the isocyanate group which typically occurred at about 121 ppm was not observed, suggested that the unreacted \u2013NCO groups had been reacted or removed after the purification. The average molecular weight between branch points and the average number of branch per 100,000 g/mol ( B n ) of LCB-PPDO can be calculated from 1 H NMR spectra by following equations and listed in Table 2 . The intensity of the methyl groups ( I 0.88 ) and methine groups ( I 1.67 ) can be used to calculate the molar ratio ( M r ) of 3a-PPDO to 2a-PPDO in the products by the following equation: (1) M r = n 2 a n 3 a = 3 \u00d7 I 1.67 4 \u00d7 I 0.88 where I 1.67 is the intensity of methene groups of BD and I 0.88 is the intensity of methyl groups of TMP, n 3a and n 2a are the average numbers of 3a-PPDO and 2a-PPDO segments per LCB-PPDO molecule, respectively. The average molecular weight between branch points ( M b ) can be expressed by following: (2) M b = 2 3 \u00d7 M 3 a + M r \u00d7 M 2 a where M 3a and M 2a are the number-average molecular weights of 3a-PPDO and of 2a-PPDO, respectively. The average number of branch per 100,000 g/mol ( B n ) can be calculated by following equation [1] : (3) B n = 100 , 000 M b - 1 2 A series of LCB-PPDOs with similar molecular weight but different branch densities were selected for investigating the influence of molecular structure on the characteristics of LCB-PPDO. The factors of molecular structure, such as the average number of branch per 100,000 g/mol ( B n ), the average molecular weight between branch points, which derived from the equations hereinbefore, of those LCB-PPDOs are all listed in Table 2 . 3.4 Thermal and crystalline behaviors of LCB-PPDO polymers The thermal behavior and crystallization of LCB-PPDO were studied via DSC. Clearly, the LCB structures include M b and branch density does have a significant influence on the thermal behavior and the crystallinity. The DSC curves of LCB-PPDOs and linear PPDO during the first heating scan and cooling scan and the subsequent reheating scan are shown in Fig. 4(a)\u2013(c) , respectively. The detailed thermal characteristics, such as glass transition temperature ( T g ), crystallization temperatures ( T c ), melting temperature ( T m ), crystallization enthalpy during the cooling scan (\u0394 H c1 ), the second crystallization enthalpy during the heating scan (\u0394 H c2 ) and the enthalpies of fusion (\u0394 H m ) are all listed in Table 3 . As shown in Fig. 4 (b), unlike linear PPDO, LCB-PPDOs have no crystallization observed during cooling. In the subsequent heating scan, it can be seen that the crystallization temperatures ( T c ) increase evidently with branch density. The LCB structure and the presence of heterogeneous segments such as TMP, BD and amide in LCB-PPDO chains may disturb the crystallization of PPDO segments. In order to further explain the phenomena, we introduce the conception of relative crystallinity ( X c ), which was calculated from the first and the second heating scan using the following equations: (4) X c = \u0394 H m \u0394 H 0 \u00d7 100 % where \u0394 H m is the specific enthalpy of melting for the first and the second heating scan and \u0394 H 0 is the melt enthalpy of the hypothetically 100% crystalline PPDO (\u0394 H 0 = 141 J/g) [20] . The detailed data were listed in Table 3 . It is documented that a high degree of branching in a polymer backbone provides lower crystallinity, for the case of symmetric chains that easily crystallize, than a linear polymer with equal molecular weight [21] . The X c1 of LCB-PPDOs from the first heating scan is lower than that of linear PPDO, and is decreased with the increase of branch density, indicating that the presence of branching structure and heterogeneous segments may frustrate the crystallization process of PPDO segments and therefore decrease the degree of crystallinity even after the consummate crystallization process. Moreover, during the second heating scan, the crystallinity of LCB-PPDOs was lower than that during the first heating scan, and the difference between two heating scans decreased with the increase of branch density. The introduction of heterogenous molecular segments from initiator and chain extender may also decrease the crystallization rate of PPDO segments and the samples could not crystallize completely during the cooling and following second heating scan with 10 \u00b0C of heating and cooling rate [15] . The LCB-PPDO with higher branch density has higher content of heterogeneous molecular segments from BD, TMP, and HDI, and therefore resulted in a much smaller degree of crystallinity than those of linear PPDO and LCB-PPDO with lower branch density during the second heating scan. The XRD patterns of linear PPDO and LCB-PPDOs are shown in Fig. 5 . Obvious reflections are observed at 2 \u03b8 = 22\u00b0, 24\u00b0 and 29\u00b0, assigned to 210, 020 and 310 planes, respectively [22] , It is clear that the XRD profiles of LCB-PPDOs are almost identical as those of linear PPDO, indicated that the crystallization was decided by PPDO segments, and the introduction of LCB structure and heterogeneous segments did not disturb the unit-cell dimensions of PPDO segments. This result is in good accordance with those of star-branched PPDO [13] and linear chain-extended PPDO using isocyanate as extender [15] reported before. 3.5 Rheological properties of LCB-PPDOs The Small-Amplitude Dynamic Oscillatory Shear measurement was used to study the rheological properties of LCB-PPDOs. The shear rheological behavior of macromolecules is very sensitive to the topological structure. The presence of very small amounts of LCB can influence the zero-shear viscosity ( \u03b7 0 ), the complex viscosity ( \u03b7\u2217 ) and the degree of shear thinning, as compared to the linear polymers with similar molecular weight [23\u201325] . Fig. 6 showed the complex viscosities of the LCB-PPDOs and Linear PPDO. From this figure, it was readily apparent that the branch density had a significant influence on the complex viscosity over the entire frequency range studied. The shear thinning of LCB-PPDOs started at lower frequency than that of linear PPDO. Unlike linear PPDO, no obvious Newonian-plateau was observed for LCB-PPDOs at low frequency which can be attributed to the long relaxation times of branched polymers. The branches of LCB-PPDOs may form sufficient entanglements with each other and the number of entanglements increased with branch density. Therefore, LCB-PPDOs exhibit a higher complex viscosity than linear PPDO with similar molecular weight, and the complex viscosities of LCB-PPDOs increased with the branch density at low frequency. While at high frequency, the LCB-PPDOs exhibited a lower viscosity than linear PPDO owning to a higher degree of shear thinning. Furthermore, the extent of shear thinning was increased with branch density of the LCB-PPDOs. The viscosity of the samples could be fitted by the Cross equation [26] , given by Eq. (5) : (5) \u03b7 \u2217 ( \u03c9 ) = \u03b7 0 1 + ( \u03bb \u03c9 ) n where \u03bb is relaxation time, \u03b7 0 is zero-shear viscosity, and n is shear-thinning index, which indicates the degree of non-Newonian behavior. These values are all listed in Table 2 . LCB-PPDOs exhibit much higher zero-shear viscosity, higher relaxation time and lower shear-thinning index comparing to those of linear PPDO. In addition, the \u03b7 0 of the LCB-PPDOs and relaxation time increased while the shear-thinning index decreased with the increase of the branch density. Since those LCB-PPDOs used for rheological characterization have similar molecular weight, the changes in LCB structure should be the main reason for such results. Similar phenomena were also observed for other LCB polymers [25,27\u201330] . Besides zero-shear viscosity, other properties such as the storage and loss moduli (G\u2032, G\u2033) were also influenced by LCB [24,30\u201332] . Fig. 7 showed the storage modulus G\u2019 plotted as a function of angular frequencies at a reference temperature of 120 \u00b0C for LCB-PPDOs and linear PPDO. The G\u2019 of linear PPDO increased with frequency and the slope of G\u2032 approached 2 at low frequency. Whereas LCB-PPDOs were observed to have broadened G\u2032 with slopes only approached 1.3 at low frequencies measured, and decreased with the increase of branch density, indicating the relaxation times increased with the increase of the branch density of the polymers. LCB added a mode of relaxation at low frequency, which was not present in the linear PPDO. The master curves of storage and loss modulus of LCB-20 and linear PPDO were shown in Fig. 8 with the remainders omitted to prevent crowding. At lower frequencies, linear PPDO followed the well-known frequency dependence, which was usually observed for linear polymers, i.e., G\u2032 and G\u2033 became proportional to \u03c9 2 and \u03c9 , respectively. It was apparent that LCB-20 had significantly higher values of G\u2032 and G\u2033 than linear PPDO at low frequencies, while at the high frequencies \u03c9 c , a crossover between G\u2032 and G\u2033 curves of LCB-20 was observed. Moreover, no proportionality of G \u2032 and G \u2033 to \u03c9 2 and \u03c9 was observed for LCB-PPDOs at the lowest frequencies measured, which confirmed the presence of long-chain-branched structure. The relaxation time determined from \u03c4 = 1/ \u03c9 c , where \u03c9 c is the frequency at which the G\u2032 and G\u2033 curves cross each other, is in good accordance with that of calculated from Eq. (5) . The frequency independency of loss tangent tan ( \u03b4 ) \u2261 G\u2033/G\u2032 has been widely used for examining LCB polymers [24,25,33] . Fig. 9 indicates tan \u03b4 as a function of frequencies for LCB-PPDOs and linear PPDO. For PPDO, tan \u03b4 increased intensively with the increase of frequency, which was a typical terminal behavior of liquid-like material. For LCB-PPDOs, tan \u03b4 was lower than that of linear PPDO at the same frequency; moreover, it decreased with the increase of branch density of LCB-PPDOs. As mentioned previously, the relaxation time was determined by \u03c9 c , a frequency at which the G\u2032 and G\u2033 curves cross each other, and tan ( \u03b4 ) is equal to 1 at the crossover. Because tan \u03b4 decreased with the increase of branch density of LCB-PPDOs at the same frequency, \u03c9 c decreased with the increase of branch density, indicating the relaxation take place at a lower frequency for high branch density LCB-PPDO. 4 Conclusions PPDO\u2019s with long-chain branches (LCB-PPDOs) have been successfully synthesized via the reaction between the terminated hydroxyl groups of linear bi-functional and star-shape tri-functional PPDO prepolymers using HDI as the chain-extending agent. The average number of branch per 100,000 g/mol ( B n ) and branch length of LCB-PPDOs can be controlled by changing the chain length of prepolymers, and range from 0 to 6.72 branch points per 100,000 g/mol and from 6900 g/mol to 20,500 g/mol, respectively, according to the results calculated from 1 H NMR. The undesired gelation reaction could be also depressed successfully by adjusting the chain length and content of tri-functional prepolymers. The crystalline temperature T c of LCB-PPDOs increases, and the relative crystallinity X c and crystallization rates decrease evidently with the increase of branch density, but the crystalline structure has not been disturbed according to the results investigated by DSC and XRD technique. Small-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments show that the LCB structures have obvious influence on the rheological properties of PPDO. As the branch density of PPDO increases, zero-shear viscosity \u03b7 0 , G\u2032 at low frequency and relaxation times \u03bb increase, whilst the shear-thinning index n and loss angle decrease, which are in accordance with those of representative LCB polymers. Therefore, the rheological behaviors of PPDO can be well-controlled via synthesizing LCB-PPDOs with the desired architectures.

        "abstract": "A series of amphiphilic biodegradable and biocompatible poly(p-dioxanone)-grafted poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) copolymers with well-defined structure were obtained by a three-step synthesis based on the \"grafting from\" concept. The first step (protection step), called the partial silylation of PVA hydroxyl groups, was accomplished by 1,1,1,3,3,3- hexamethyldisilazane and catalyst chlorotrimethylsilane in dimethyl sulfoxide using THF as cosolvent. The second step was the ring-opening polymerization of p-dioxanone (PDO) initiated from the remaining OH groups of the partially silylated PVA. Finally, a deprotection step was followed: the silylether group was deprotected easily under very mild conditions. The synthetic conditions of the first two steps were investigated, and the structures of polymers formed in each step were characterized by various analytical methods. The results showed that the molecular structure of the PVA-g-PPDO could be controlled easily by the degree of silylation and the feed ratio. In addition, the micellization of amphiphilic PVA-g-PPDO copolymers in water was proved by fluorescence spectra and dynamic light scattering, and the relationship between structural parameters of copolymers and micellar properties was studied preliminarily. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The chemical structures and molecular weights of PEUs, containing different block lengths and weight fractions of PLLA and PBS, were characterized by 1H NMR and GPC. The effects of the structures on the physical properties of PEUs were systematically studied by means of DSC, TGA, WAXD and tensile testing. The DSC results indicated that PLLA segment was compatible well with PBS segment in amorphous phase and the crystallization of PEU was predominantly caused by PBS segment, which was also confirmed by WAXD. The results of tensile testing showed that the extensibility of PLLA was largely improved by incorporating PBS segment. The PEU can be used as a potential substitute for some petroleum-based thermoplastics. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Aromatic-aliphatic copolyesters of poly(ethylene-co-diethylene terephthalate)-co-poly(l-lactic acid) (PEDLT) with different compositions were synthesized by direct melt copolyesterization of l-lactic acid oligomers and poly(ethylene-co-diethylene terephthalate) (PEDT) oligomers. Chemical structures, thermal properties, and crystalline behaviors were studied. 1H NMR confirmed that the short lactyl units were incorporated into the PEDT chains. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that PEDLT copolyesters were thermally stable up to about 380 \u00b0C. Both wide-angle X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that no poly(l-lactic acid) crystal was formed during the crystallization of PEDLT copolyesters. Isothermal crystallization of PEDLT copolyesters was carried out, and it was found that both the crystallinity and crystal growth rate decreased after incorporation of lactyl units compared with those of PEDT. The obtained aromatic-aliphatic copolyesters are expected to find a potential application as biodegradable polymer materials. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A novel phosphorus-containing copolyester (PTTP), poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) copolyester with a bulky linking pendent group of 9,10-dihydro-10-[2,3-di(hydroxycarbonyl) propyl]-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DDP) was prepared, and its crystallization, crystal morphology and interference color were investigated in this article for the first time. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results showed that with the increase of DDP content, the melting point (T(m)) and crystallization ability of PTTP decreased. WAXD results suggests that the three samples share one crystal structure, however the crystallinity decreases with increasing DDP content. Polarized optical microscope (POM) observation indicated that the samples showed non-banded spherulites at a lower and higher temperature, and banded spherulites at the middle temperature range. From the micrographs obtained from scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), ringed patterns with many defects could be found for samples with higher DDP contents, which crystallized at a lower temperature, and a transformation from square-shaped spherulites to circular spherulites was noted for samples with higher DDP contents, which crystallized at a higher temperature. The interference color of the spherulites was also studied and it was shown that with the increase of film thickness or decrease of DDP content, the spherulites became more colorful under POM observation, indicating that the hindering effect and randomness caused by incorporating the DDP monomer with a bulky pendent group into the PTT molecular chain exhibited a negative influence on the molecular mobility and crystallization ability of the copolyester, and led to the formation of the defective band morphology and the less colorful interference color of the PTTP spherulites.",

The single glass transition and depressed crystallization temperatures of PEUs with different compositions suggest that PBS and PLLA segments are miscible in amorphous phase of PEUs. Nonisothermal crystallization kinetics of PEUs was studied by Avrami and Mo methods; both results suggest that the crystallization rates of PEUs decreased with increasing weight fraction of PLLA segments. POM results indicate that banded spherulites were formed for PEUs when PLLA segments were introduced, and the band spacing increased with weight fraction of PLLA segments. The investigation of WAXD demonstrated the crystal structure of PEUs was the same as that of PBS, suggesting the crystallization of PEUs arose from PBS segments, and PLLA segments were unable to crystallize in PEUs. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

The flame retardancy, mechanical properties, crystallization and thermal degradation behaviour of PET/PLCP blends have been investigated via different methods such as LOI values and UL-94 rating, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffractometry (WAXD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). PLCP can dramatically improve the flame retardancy and the melt dripping behaviour of PET. The tensile strengths of PET/PLCP blends increase with the increase of PLCP content. PLCP in PET/PLCP blends acts as a nucleating agent for PET and accelerates its crystallization. PLCP widens the temperature range of PET decomposition. The residues of PET/PLCP blends at high temperatures increase with the increase of PLCP content.",

        "abstract": "Recently, two-way oil/water separation materials bearing both \"water-removing\" and \"oil-removing\" functions are of great interest for treating environmental water pollution. Despite having switchable surface wettability, these materials are generally designed to possess superhydrophilicity in air, which, standing on the viewpoint of thermodynamics, is unstable and easy to lose the superwetting property. Concerning the full exploitation of sustainable biomass resources, herein, we use soy protein and ramie fiber to fabricate a cross-linked biocomposite whose amphiphilicity can be tuned by introducing a low surface-energy agent, octadecylamine. The resultant composite can be used as a coating for stainless steel meshes, preparing stably hydrophobic surface in air as well as achieving dual superlyophobicity under liquid that is required for efficiently separating light and heavy oils from water. Furthermore, a high separation efficiency is acquired for both light oil/water and heavy oil/water mixtures during cyclicusage. Notably, the fully bio-based coating displays high resistance against mechanical abrasion and harsh chemical corrosions (acid, alkaline, and salt) without losing high separation efficiency, indicating the potential application of such material in oily wastewater treatment.",

        "abstract": "Multi-shape polymers have recently attracted growing interest on account of their ability to switch between multiple shapes in a predetermined way. In this work, thermally induced shape-memory PPDO-PEG networks with well-defined architecture have been designed and prepared by coupling hydroxyl-telechelic three-arm star-shaped PPDO and PEG diol precursors with HDI in 1,2-dichloroethane. The molecular weight and the feed ratio of the two precursors affected the gel content and the cross-link density of the network. The DSC analysis indicated that increasing the content of a precursor, or its molecular weight, was helpful in enhancing the crystallization degree of its own domains. The testing of dual-shape and triple-shape effects of networks showed that composition and cross-link density played an important role. As a typical sample, PPDO(9k)65-PEG(6k)35 exhibits a triple-shape effect, which possesses two separate and apparent melting endothermic peaks for the PPDO and PEG segments respectively. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "As a wise and profound teacher, nature provides numerous creatures with rich colors to us. To biomimic structural colors in nature as well as color changes responsive to environmental stimuli, there is a long way to go for the development of free-standing photonic films from natural polymers. Herein, a highly flexible, controllably iridescent, and multi-stimuli-responsive cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) film is prepared by simply introducing a small molecule as both plasticizer and hygroscopic agent. The presence of the additive does not block the self assembly of CNC in aqueous solution but results in the enhancement of its mechanical toughness, making it possible to obtain free-standing iridescent CNC films with tunable structural colors. In response to environmental humidity and mechanical compression, such films can change structural colors smoothly by modulating their chiral nematic structures. Notably, the chromism is reversible by alternately changing relative humidity between 16% and 98%, mimicking a longhorn beetle Tmesisternus isabellae. This chromic effect enables various applications of the bio-films in colorimetric sensors, anti-counterfeiting technology, and decorative coatings.",

The crystal morphologies of PTT- co -PLLA copolyesters were investigated with polarized light microscope (PLM). It was found that PTT- co -PLLA copolyesters exhibited banded spherulites with smaller band spacing at the same degree of super-cooling compared with PTT homopolymer. The PLLA segments in those copolyesters ranged from 0 to 28.4\u00a0mol% and did not form crystals during crystallization. Hydrolysis study on PTT homopolymer and PTT- co -PLLA copolyesters was carried out in buffer solutions. PTT- co -PLLA copolyesters represented pronounced hydrolytic degradation, which increased with the content of lactyl units. And it was concluded that degradation of PTT-co-PLLA was mainly attributed to the scission of PLLA segments.",

In order to understand the relationship between their structure and properties, the thermal transition, crystallization and spherulitic morphology of PPDO/starch blends have been studied by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy. It was found that when 5 wt% starch was added to PPDO, a clear nucleating effect was observed. When the blends were crystallized from the melt, they formed banded spherulites that exhibited a well-defined Maltese cross depending on the crystallization temperature. Avrami exponents and crystallization rate constants of the blends with 5 wt% starch were higher than those of PPDO and those of the blends with 10 wt% starch. Both the dynamic DSC results and isothermal crystallization data indicated that the starch, with a content of 5 wt% in the blends, acted as the nucleating agent for PPDO. \u00a9 2004 Acta Materialia Inc.

For comparison, two kinds of ABS samples were prepared: ABS-1 was toughened by a conventional modifier (a low-cis polybutadiene rubber/styrene-butadiene block copolymer), and ABS-2 was toughened by SIBR. The mechanical properties, microstructures of the as-prepared materials, and fracture surface morphology of the specimens after impact were studied by instrumented notched Izod impact tests and tensile tests, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The mechanical test results show that ABS-2 had a much higher impact strength and elongation at break than ABS-1. The microscopic results suggested that fracture resistance of ABS-1 only depended on voids, shear yielding, and few crazing, which resulted in less ductile fracture behavior. Compared with ABS-1, ABS toughened by linear random SIBR (ABS-2) displayed the synergistic toughening effect of crazing and shear yielding, which could absorb and dissipate massive energy, and presented high ductile fracture behavior. These results were also confirmed by instrumented impact tests. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

It is found that the graft structures of copolymers have obvious effects on the thermal and crystallization behaviors. Because there were more defect sites in the crystalline phase originating from the short grafted chains of poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) (PPDO), the crystal structure of the copolymers was much less perfect than that of PPDO. PM revealed that the spherulitic morphology of the graft copolymers depended on graft structures and crystallization temperatures. From the single polarized micrograph of the graft copolymers it was observed clearly that the starch segments acted as nucleation sites. The Avrami equation was used to analyze the overall isothermal crystallization of the graft copolymers. Avrami exponents were almost constant at crystallization temperatures T c ranging from 45 to 60 \u00b0C. Both the PM observation and the DSC investigation (crystallization rate constant, K values) indicated that the graft copolymers crystallize faster than pure PPDO, especially at higher crystallization temperatures.",

        "abstract": "A series of intumescent flame-retardant epoxy resins (IFR-EPs) were prepared only by adding a 5 wt% total loading of ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and metal compounds. All the samples could achieve V-0 rating and did not generate dripping during UL-94 testing. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) values of the samples with 4.83 wt% APP and 0.17 wt% CoSA increase from 27.1 to 29.4, compared with epoxy resin containing 5 wt% APP. The samples also showed excellent water resistance of flame retardancy in 30 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C water for 168 h. The LOI results show that the composition of metal compounds (metal ions and ligands/anions) and the mass ratios of APP to metal compounds affect the flame retardancy of the samples. TG results indicate that the catalytic effect of CoSA on the decomposition of both APP and the epoxy resins containing APP is better than that of CuSAO. The fire behavior of epoxy resin and epoxy resins containing APP with/without CoSA were investigated by cone calorimeter. Cone calorimeter parameters of the samples such as HRR, THR, TSP and COP indicate that the addition of APP and CoSA improves the fire safety of epoxy resin significantly, and CoSA shows an obvious catalytic effect. Keywords Ammonium polyphosphate Epoxy resin Intumescence Flame retardance Catalysis 1 Introduction Epoxy resins are widely used in laminating, adhesive, coating, and casting fields due to their dimensional stability, satisfactory mechanical properties, suitable weather, chemical and thermal resistance [1] . However, its lack of flame retardancy limits its more extensive applications where high thermal stability and flame retardancy are needed. The flame retardancy of epoxy resins can be improved by introducing flame-retardant elements such as halogen, phosphorus and silicon into epoxy resins or curing agents [2,3] . Halogen-containing flame retardants are reported to be effective flame retardants for various polymer materials including epoxy resins. However, some of them are restricted to use due to their generating dense toxic smoke and corrosive products during combustion [4] . Therefore, the preparation of halogen-free flame retardants is the subject of extensive investigations. A number of halogen-free flame retardants used for epoxy resin are reported, including epoxy monomers [5\u201310] , cure agents [10\u201313] and additives [14\u201317] . Intumescent flame-retardant additives have aroused a great deal of attention. Generally, three kinds of components are incorporated into formulations to obtain intumescent flame retardancy: an acid source, a carbonization agent and a blowing agent [18,19] . Most of the epoxy resins with intumescent flame retardants are used as coatings [20\u201322] , and they can also be used as thermoset plastics [9,14,23] . As we all know, epoxy resins cured with amidogen group contain a large number of hydroxyl (OH) groups and nitrogenous groups, which can be considered as both carbonization agent and blowing agent. In our previous work [24] , we investigated a new intumescent flame-retardant epoxy resin system, in which epoxy resins cured with low-molecular-weight polyamide were used as carbonization agent and blowing agent, and ammonium polyphosphate was used as acid source. However, the high loading level of flame retardants is the major problem for halogen-free flame-retardant system, especially for intumescent flame retardants. Recently, metal compounds were used as synergistic agents for improving flame-retardant efficiency of intumescent flame-retardant system [25] . Most of these investigations were still concentrated on flame retarded polyolefin with ammonium polyphosphate and pentaerythritol system [26\u201332] . Also, some of the reports related to synergistic effect between metal compounds and intumescent flame retardants for other polymer materials such as cotton fabric [33] , polyvinyl chloride [34] , polycarbonate [35] , polyvinyl alcohol [36] and polyamide [37] . We also noticed that an easier approach for preparation of flame retarded epoxy resins had been reported recently. In these reports, ammonium polyphosphate [24,38] or melamine phosphate [39] was used as flame retardant for epoxy directly and acceptable flame retardancy was obtained. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few reports about the effect of metal compounds on flammability of flame-retarded cured epoxy resin by APP. In the present work, a series of intumescent flame-retarded epoxy resins have been prepared by using APP and metal compounds as flame retardants, and the total loading of flame retardants were kept at 5 wt%. Indeed, the focus in this investigation is to study the effect of APP and metal compounds on flame retardancy of cured epoxy. Herein, flammability and fire behavior of samples were evaluated by LOI, UL-94 vertical burning test and cone calorimeter, respectively. The thermal stabilities of the systems were also studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Diglycidyl ether of biphenol A (E-44) was provided by Wuxi Resin Factory of Xingchen New Chemical Material Co. Ltd (Wuxi, China). Low-molecular-weight polyamide (LWPA) was purchased from Haitian Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Hunan, China). Ammonium polyphosphate (APP) was supplied by Changfeng Chemical Corp. (Shifang, China), and the degree of polymerization of APP is more than 50. Ni(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) complexes were synthesized in our laboratory [30\u201332,36,40] . Ni(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) acetate salts were supplied by Kelong Chemical Reagent Corp. (Chengdu, China). The metal compounds used in this paper are summarized in Fig.\u00a01 . 2.2 Preparation of flame-retardant epoxy resin samples The cured epoxy resins were obtained by thermal curing. Intumescent flame retardants (IFR) were prepared by mixing ammonium polyphosphate with metal compounds in a certain weight ratio. Epoxy resin (E-44), low-molecular-weight polyamide and IFR were mixed together while the total content of IFR was kept 5 wt%. Finally, the composites were cured for 12 h at room temperature and for 5 h at 80 \u00b0C, and then the solid products were obtained. 2.3 Characterization The limiting oxygen index (LOI) values were measured on an HC-2C oxygen index meter (Jiangning, China) with sheet dimensions of 130 mm \u00d7 6.5 mm \u00d7 3.2 mm according to ASTM D2863-97. The vertical burning test (UL-94) of samples was conducted on a CZF-2 instrument (Jiangning, China) according to ASTM D 3801 testing procedure. The samples were made to a size of 125 mm \u00d7 12.7 mm \u00d7 3.2 mm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on TAQ500 V6.4 Build 193 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. Samples were heated in the temperature range from room temperature to 700 \u00b0C under air at a flow rate of 60 ml/min. Water resistance of flame-retardant epoxy resin was measured in an 800 ml beaker according to GB 11547-89. The fire behavior of epoxy resins was characterized by cone calorimeter under a heat flux of 35 kW/m 2 with the sheet dimensions of 100 mm \u00d7 100 mm \u00d7 6.0 mm according to ISO 5660. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Flammability The LOI values and UL-94 test are commonly used to estimate the ignition retardancy of materials. In this section, firstly we investigated the effect of different metal compounds and APP on LOI values, and the results are shown in Fig.\u00a02 . From these results, a noticeable case is that substrate structure of metal compound has a significant effect on flame-retardant efficiency. For example, LOI values of IFR-EPs\u2013MSA and IFR-EPs\u2013M(Ac) 2 are higher than those of IFR-EPs with M(AcAc) and MSAO, while the mass ratio of APP to metal compounds is kept constant (29:1). The reason for this case may be corresponding to the relationship between the structure and catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the metal element in the compound also affects flame retardancy of IFR-EPs with metal compounds. In fact, there are also some reports about this phenomenon in the literatures [25,26,30,31] . However, in this study, the case seems more complex, and has no regular sequence for the different compounds. The main reason, actually, is that there are two factors, metal elements and their chemical structures, that influence the catalysis of the compounds simultaneously. For vertical burning test, V-0 rating for all samples can be achieved easily and no dripping can be observed during testing. In addition, the effect of the mass ratio of APP to CoSA on LOI values is also investigated. The results of LOI values and UL-94 test of IFR-EPs are given in Table 1 , in which the total amount of APP and CoSA is still 5 wt%. Compared with IFR-EP only containing APP, the LOI values of IFR-EPs containing CoSA increase from 27.1 to 29.4. However, the LOI values decrease while the mass ratio of APP to CoSA is lower than 29:1, indicating that there are synergistic effects between APP and CoSA and their optimal ratio is 29: 1. It can be observed that the flame retardancy of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA is better than that of EP\u2013APP2 containing 12.5 wt% APP from Table 1 , indicating the synergistic effect between APP and CoSA is obvious. All samples of IFR-EPs could achieve V-0 rating and did not generate dripping during UL-94 test. Therefore, the mass ratio of APP to metal compounds and the composition of metal compounds would affect flame retardancy of IFR-EPs. 3.2 Water resistance of intumescent flame-retardant epoxy resins From Table 2 , the flame retardancy of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 could satisfy the actual demand for applications. However, water solubility of IFRs (typically APP, melamine and pentaerythritol) leads to the leaching of IFRs from the polymer matrix for applications under moisture or in water condition, thus the reduction of properties of materials such as flame retardancy, electrical insulation cannot be avoided [41] . The water resistance of IFR-EPs containing APP and CoSA was investigated in 30 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C water for 168 h and the flammability test results are presented in Table 2 . It can be seen that the LOI value of EP\u2013CoAPP3 is 29.0 after treated in 30 \u00b0C water for 168 h and just decreases by 0.4 units. It is very surprising that the LOI value of EP\u2013CoAPP3 is 28.7 in 70 \u00b0C water after168 h and only decreases by 0.7 units. As we all know, crosslinked network structure of epoxy resins is formed during curing. Thus, it is not easy for APP and metal compounds to leach from epoxy resins, which may be the reason why flame retardancy of IFR-EP is still kept after treated in 70 \u00b0C water for 168 h. The results indicate that the flame retardancy of IFR-EPs can be kept under moist condition and IFR-EPs can be fitted to applications. 3.3 Thermal decomposition behaviors TGA measurements can serve as useful indicators for polymer flammability [42] . Figs. 3 and 4 show TG and DTG curves of IFR-EPs and pure epoxy resin, and the main information of TG results is summarized in Table 3 . Compared with TG curves of IFR-EPs and EP in Fig.\u00a03 , IFR-EPs show an obvious decrease in thermal stability below 413 \u00b0C and a significant increase in thermal stability over 413 \u00b0C. We can see that EP decomposes rapidly in the temperature range from 300 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C, generating an amount of fuel for combustion, which is the main reason for the flammability and large soot/smoke production of EP. However, the thermal decomposition rates of IFR-EPs are lower than that of EP, which could help to produce char to protect polymer matrix. From Fig.\u00a04 , it can be seen that the thermal degradation process of IFR-EPs and EP could be separated into two main steps. At the first step, APP could decompose under heat to yield polyphosphoric acid, water and ammonia; and polyphosphoric acid could react with the hydroxyl of cured epoxy resin to produce crosslinked phosphate ester. The resulting residues at the first step would decompose further to yield a lacunaris and compact char coating surface of the material, which can protect the polymer matrix effectively at the second step. We have discussed the thermal degradation mechanism of the reactions between EP and APP by TG, FT-IR and XPS in detail in our previous work [24] . Thus, we will mainly discuss the interaction between EP and the mixture of APP with metal compounds and synergistic effect between APP and metal compounds in this paper. From Table 3 , we can see that the onset degradation temperatures ( T onset ) of IFR-EPs containing metal compounds are lower than that of EP\u2013APP and the T max1 (the temperature at the maximal degradation rate at the first step of thermal degradation) of IFR-EPs containing metal compounds decrease by about 5\u201311 \u00b0C compared with that of EP\u2013APP. The results of T onset and T max1 show that the addition of metal compounds could catalyze the degradation behavior of IFR-EP, which is an evidence for synergistic effect between APP and metal compounds. When TG curves of IFR-EPs in the temperature range from 200 \u00b0C to 420 \u00b0C are compared, the degradation rate of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 is quicker than that of EP\u2013APP all through; the degradation rate of EP\u2013APP\u2013CuSAO is quicker than that of EP\u2013APP firstly, and then the degradation rate of EP\u2013APP\u2013CuSAO is slower than that of the others, indicating that the catalytic effect of CoSA on degradation of EP\u2013APP is better than that of CuSAO. The residues of EP\u2013APP\u2013CuSAO at 400 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C are more than that of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA, which also suggested that the addition of CuSAO could not catalyze the degradation of IFR-EP effectively. Relating with the results of LOI values, the degradation rate of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 with high LOI value is quicker than those of EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CuSAO. Therefore, the addition of CoSA affects the char-forming process, which occurs at the first step. However, a regular rule could not be found from the degradation of IFR-EPs at the second step. In order to investigate the synergistic effect between APP and metal compounds further, we examined the mixture of APP with CoSA or CuSAO by TG. Fig.\u00a05 presents TG curves of APP, CoSA and the mixture of APP with metal compounds (APP\u2013CoSA, APP\u2013CuSAO). The calculated TG curve for APP\u2013CoSA is given in Fig.\u00a05 . The mass loss of APP\u2013CoSA for the calculated TG curve is calculated from the formula: mass loss of pure APP \u00d7 content of APP + mass loss of cured epoxy resin \u00d7 content of cured epoxy resin. It can be observed that TG curves of APP, APP\u2013CoSA and APP\u2013CuSAO are almost the same below 600 \u00b0C in Fig.\u00a05 . However, we can see that the decomposition rates of APP\u2013CoSA and APP\u2013CuSAO are quicker than that of APP in the temperature range from150 \u00b0C to 420 \u00b0C. From comparison of TG curves between Cal\u2013APP\u2013CoSA and APP\u2013CoSA, we can find that the addition of CoSA can catalyze significantly decomposition of APP. The different catalytic effects between CoSA and CuSAO on decomposition of APP can also be observed above 600 \u00b0C from Fig.\u00a05 . Compared with CuSAO, CoSA could accelerate the decomposition of APP obviously above 600 \u00b0C. More information of TG is summarized in Table 4 . The T onset s of APP\u2013CoSA and APP\u2013CuSAO decrease by about 24 \u00b0C compared with T onset s of APP, which is an evidence for catalysis of metal compounds. The T max1 (the temperature at the maximal decomposition rate at the first step of thermal decomposition) of APP\u2013CoSA (292 \u00b0C) is lower than that of APP (297 \u00b0C) while T max1 of APP\u2013CuSAO (302 \u00b0C) is higher than that of APP. It suggests that the catalytic effect of CoSA on decomposition of APP is better than that of CuSAO, which may be one of the reasons that the flame retardancy of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA is better than that of EP\u2013APP\u2013CuSAO. However, at the second step of thermal decomposition, the temperatures at the maximal decomposition rate ( T max2 ) of these samples are almost the same as thermal decomposition of crosslinking of polyphosphoric acid formed at the first step takes place mainly. The order of the residues of APP\u2013CoSA, APP\u2013CuSAO and APP at 420 \u00b0C and 700 \u00b0C are the same: APP > APP\u2013CuSAO > APP\u2013CoSA, which indicates that the\u00a0catalysis of CoSA on APP is better than that of CuSAO both at the step of decomposition of APP and further decomposition at the next step. Therefore, the catalysis of CoSA on the decomposition of APP is better than that of CuSAO from TG results, which is the reason that the flame retardancy of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 is better than that of EP\u2013APP\u2013CuSAO. 3.4 Fire behavior The cone calorimeter was used to investigate the effects of APP and CoSA in various samples (EP, EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3) on the fire behavior of the composites. Cone calorimeter is one of the most useful bench-scale tests and provides a wealth of information to simulate real-world fire conditions [43,44] . Fire risk of materials can be investigated by cone calorimeter parameters such as time to ignition (TTI), heat release rate (HRR), total heat release (THR), smoke production rate (SPR), total smoke production (SPR), carbon monoxide (CO) production and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) production. HRR is one of the most important parameters for predictor of fire hazard [45] . Fig.\u00a06 presents curves of heat release rate of EP, EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3. It can be observed that pure epoxy resin burns rapidly after ignition and HRR reaches a sharp peak with a peak heat\u00a0release rate (PHRR) of 939 kW/m 2 . It is very surprising that\u00a0PHRRs of EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 are reduced remarkably to 283 and 310 kW/m 2 , respectively, with only 5 wt% of loading level.\u00a0Based upon the shape of HRR curves of samples, it is indicated clearly that EP is a typical non-charring material and EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 are typical charring materials [43] . The results suggest that the addition of APP with/without CoSA can improve the flame retardancy of epoxy resin significantly. Fig.\u00a07 presents curves of total heat release of the samples. It can be seen that THR values of samples containing APP with/without CoSA are lower than that of EP during testing, which is in accordance with the results of HRR. However, HRR curves of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 and EP\u2013APP are almost the same during the first 390 s, and then HRR values of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 are lower than that of EP\u2013APP obviously as shown in Fig.\u00a06 . We can also observe that THR values of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 are almost the same as that of EP\u2013APP during the first 450 s, but the THR values of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 are lower than that of EP\u2013APP clearly after the 450th second. Thus, the fire behavior of EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 can be separated into two steps. It is known that intumescent flame-retardant materials can produce gas, water and intumescent char under heat or combustion, which can protect the underlying materials [18] . For IFR-EPs with/without CoSA, the process of charring is almost the same, and this is why the HRR and THR curves of EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 are almost the same at the first step. However, the quality of char formed at the first step may be different; the char of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 may be more compact than that of EP\u2013APP due to the synergistic effect between CoSA and APP, which can protect underlying materials more effectively. That is the reason for the lower HRR and THR values of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 than that of EP\u2013APP. Therefore, the effect of CoSA on fire behavior can be observed clearly at the second step. Cone calorimeter parameters are summarized in Table 5 . The order of time to peak HRR (TTPHRR) of samples is as follows: EP (265 s) < EP\u2013APP (325 s) < EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA (355 s), which shows the addition of APP and CoSA can delay TTPHRR. The average HRR (Av-HRR) of EP\u2013CoSA is lower than that of EP\u2013APP though PHRR of EP\u2013CoSA is a little higher than that of EP\u2013APP from Table 5 , indicating that there exists the synergistic effect between APP and CoSA for flame-retardant epoxy resin. The smoke and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide generated during combustion are the other two most important factors concerning fire hazard. The higher smoke production is attributed to the dehydrogenation effect leading to aromatic volatiles in the flame, which results in a soot increase [46,47] . Fig.\u00a08 presents total smoke production (TSP) of the samples. TSP values of EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA are much lower than that of EP, which indicates the intumescent char acts as a physical barrier in preventing soot/smoke from being formed underlying materials. The TSP value of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA is lower than that of EP\u2013APP, which shows that the physical barrier of the intumescent char of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA is more effective than that of EP\u2013APP, suggesting that the char of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA is more compact than that of EP\u2013APP. The results of total smoke production (TSP) are according to the results of THR and Av-HRR, which shows that there are the synergistic effects between APP and CoSA. The reduction of smoke production suggests that more carbonaceous material remains as char. The curves of CO and CO 2 production of samples are shown in Figs. 9 and 10 , respectively. Comparing CO production (COP) curves of EP\u2013APP with that of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 in Fig.\u00a09 , it can be found that CoSA can reduce CO production after 360th second and that the CO productions of EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA are lower than that of EP, indicating that addition of APP and CoSA can reduce both flammability and fire toxic gases of epoxy resin. A\u00a0similar conclusion can be achieved for CO 2 production (CO 2 P) of samples from Fig.\u00a010 . Lower CO 2 P and COP suggest that more residual mass remains during testing [48] , or in other words, mass loss becomes smaller. Fig.\u00a011 presents the curves of the ratio of CO 2 P to COP of samples. The curves of ratio of the CO 2 to CO production are gotten by CO 2 P/COP, which are presented in Fig.\u00a011 . It can be observed that the values of EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 are significantly lower than that of EP from Fig.\u00a011 , suggesting that the more incomplete combustion of EP\u2013APP or EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA occurred than that of EP, which is the result of protecting char formed [43] . It is known that incomplete combustion leads to more CO production, which is very dangerous in fire. However, COP of EP\u2013APP or EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 is lower than that of EP from Fig.\u00a09 , which is also the result of protecting char formed. From Table 5 , it can be seen that mass losses of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 (52.1%) and EP\u2013APP (63.5%) are much lower than that of EP (95.6%), and mass loss of EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA is lower than that of EP\u2013APP, indicating that the addition of APP and CoSA can greatly enhance the char yield of the flame-retardant epoxy resin and that CoSA has an obvious catalyzing-charring effect. 4 Conclusion Flame retardancy of epoxy resin could be improved by adding APP and metal compounds. The LOI values of flame-retardant epoxy resins increase about 0\u20132.3 unit while total loading of APP and metal compounds is 5 wt%. The highest LOI value of all samples is 29.4 (EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3) while the mass ratio of APP to CoSA is 29:1. It can be found that there are two important factors affecting flammability of IFR-EPs from results of LOI testing: composition of metal compounds including metal elements and ligands/anions, and mass ratio of APP to metal compounds. The IFR-EP containing APP and CoSA has good water resistance after treated in both 30 \u00b0C water and 70 \u00b0C water for 168 h, and the LOI values of samples decrease slightly (about 0.4 and 0.7 units). The comparison with TG results between EP\u2013APP and IFR-EPMs indicates that addition of metal compounds can catalyze decomposition of EP containing APP to produce noncombustible volatile gas in initial stage. The TG results of APP, CoSA and mixture of APP and CoSA show that CoSA has catalytic effect both in initial decomposition stage of APP and later crosslinking of polyphosphoric acid. Thus, metal compounds can enhance flame retardancy of epoxy resin containing APP. Most of the cone calorimeter parameters of IFR-EPs with 5 wt% of total loading of APP and CoSA are improved significantly compared with those of pure epoxy resin. Those parameters such as HRR, THR, TSP, TTPHRR and mass loss of EP\u2013APP and EP\u2013APP\u2013CoSA3 indicate that CoSA can enhance the flame retardancy of epoxy resins containing APP.

The synthesized polymer was a novel segmented poly(ester urethane) ionomer (PESI) in which the soft segments were formed by reaction of HO-PES-OH with HDI and the hard segments that contained ionic groups were derived from reaction of DEAH with HDI. The crystallization rate of PESI was dramatically accelerated when 3 mol % urethane ionic groups were incorporated. However, the crystallization mechanism did not change. The significant acceleration in crystallization rate was attributed to the improved nucleation efficiency by incorporation of the urethane ionic group, because PESI showed significantly enhanced nucleation density but slightly slowed spherurlitic growth rate in comparison with PES which was synthesized by chain extension reaction of HO-PES-OH with HDI. The increased nucleation efficiency was ascribed to the aggregation of hard segments of PESI induced by the ionic interactions. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

The degradation behaviors were studied by using the inherent viscosity measurement, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), infrared analysis (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (NMR), and thermal analysis (DSC). With increasing the addition amount of boron trifluoride, the molecular weight of PCL decreases; the molecular weight distribution is broadened; and the degree of crystallinity of PCL increases at first at low BF 3 level, then decreases when BF 3 content exceeds to 2.64\u00a0wt%. The results of IR, 1 HNMR and GPC reveal that \u025b -caprolactone monomer does not occur and the main degradation products are the oligomers of PCL with low molecular weight.

The results obtained have been compared with those of USY, ZSM-5, and also thermal degradation. The degradation behaviours of LDPE and PP using DeLaZSM-5 were quite different from those observed in thermal degradation and in studies using USY as catalysts. LDPE exhibited much higher degradation activity using the DeLaZSM-5 than PP did, especially in relatively lower temperature stage, indicating that DeLaZSM-5 shows a shape-selective effect in catalytic degradation of LDPE and PP. The factors affecting the shape-selective effect of DeLaZSM-5 are discussed. It was concluded that the pore structure and unique acid properties of the DeLaZSM-5 as well as proper reaction temperatures were important factors to fully exert this shape-selective effect.",

PEPBP was used as the flame-retardant finishing agent for cotton fabrics. The flame retardancy of the samples was characterized by limiting oxygen index (LOI) and the vertical burning test. The cotton fabric sample with 21.2 wt% of PEPBP has a LOI value of 33.8, which is 14.4 higher than that of the untreated cotton sample. The treated cotton fabrics have shorter after-glow time, shorter char length and no after-flame during the vertical burning test. The thermal decomposition behaviors of the fabrics, the chemical structures and morphologies of the residues of the fabrics were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively, and a possible flame retardant mechanism was discussed. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The addition of multivalent cations (Ca(2+) and Al(3+)) resulted in apparent cross-linking of the polymer and enhancement of aerogel properties. The compressive properties increased as the solid contents (both pectin and clay) increased; moduli in the range of 0.04-114 MPa were obtained for materials with bulk densities ranging from 0.03 g/cm(3) to 0.19 g/cm(3), accompanied by microstructural changes from a lamellar structure to a cellular structure. Biodegradability of the aerogels was investigated by detecting CO2 release for 4 weeks in compost media. The results revealed that pectin aerogels possess higher biodegradation rates than wheat starch, which is often used as a standard for effective biodegradation. The addition of clay and multivalent cations surprisingly increased the biodegradation rates.",

Phosphorus analysis of the resulting polymers suggests that BCPPO has been introduced to PTT chain successfully. 1H and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra further confirm the random chemical structure. The thermal behavior was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The introduction of BCPPO to PTT lowered the melting point and crystallization ability because of the random copolymerization and the rigid structure of BCPPO, and the thermal stabilities of PTTBP were improved in air but decreased in nitrogen. Rheological investigations showed that the complex viscosities of all the samples were independent of frequency at low frequency (say lower than 100rads), and shear thinning effect occurred at higher frequency. The cone calorimeter was used to test the fire behavior of PTTBP, and the results suggested that the novel copolyester had good flame retardance. \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The length of PPDO graft chains can be controlled easily by using the prepolymers of PPDO with different molecular weights. The copolymers were prepared by two-step reactions. First, the isocyanate\u2013terminated intermediate (PPDO\u2013NCO) was prepared by introducing one NCO group of TDI onto the hydroxyl end-group of PPDO; second, PPDO\u2013NCO was grafted onto corn starch chains by the reaction between the unreacted NCO group and the hydroxyls of starch, and then, starch- graft -PPDO was obtained. The chemical structure of PPDO\u2013NCO and graft copolymers was confirmed by using FT-IR and 1 H NMR, and the thermal properties of the copolymers were investigated by DSC and TG.",

Although the PPDO and PLA blocks are immiscible with each other, an interesting interpenetrating spherulite morphology, which always occurs in miscible blends, was observed. Since the chemical bonding and branching molecular structure of the copolymer may resulted in a relatively small phase separation, the crystals of PPDO can nucleate and grew confined inside the matrix of pre-crystallized PLA spherulites. The morphologies of both PLA and PPDO crystals were significantly affected by the crystallization condition and process. Both the growth rate and nucleation rate of PPDO segments were enhanced rather than depressed under the confinement crystallization imposed by pre-crystallized PLA when relatively small amounts of PLA were added. The nucleation density of PPDO increased obviously with a small change in the self-nucleation temperature of PLA suggesting that the pre-crystallized PLA may serve as a heterogeneous nucleation agent for the crystallization of PPDO segments. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Two bio-based polymers, cellulose diacetate (CDA) and starch, were used to prepare blends with reasonable properties and low cost. Due to the poor processing properties, starch was modified in the presence of glycerol and epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), and CDA was plasticized by triacetin (TA) and ESO, respectively. The morphologies of the blends with different amounts of modified starch (MST) were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the physical properties of the blends, including thermal stability, mechanical property, water and moisture resistance, were investigated. The equilibrium moisture absorption rates of the blends containing 30 and 50 wt% MST at 100 % of relative humidity(RH) were 9. 4 and 15. 0 %, respectively. SEM and DMA results demonstrated that CDA and MST had a certain extent of compatibility. Due to the partial plasticization of starch, the tensile strength of the blends was nearly not affected by the amount of MST. Even if 50 wt% MST was added, the tensile strength of the blend was as high as 24. 7 MPa. The obtained blend containing 30 wt% MST can keep good mechanical properties at 50 % RH, and its tensile strength and elongation at break are 30. 2 MPa and 3. 6 %, respectively. All the results show that the CDA/MST blends have a potential as an environmental friendly material. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a novel phosphorus-containing ionic monomer, named sodium salt of 10H-phenoxaphosphine-2,8-dicarboxylic acid,10-hydroxy-,2,8- dihydroxyethyl ester,10-oxide (DHPPO-Na), was synthesized, characterized, and then copolymerized to prepare poly(ethylene terephthalate)-based ionomers. The chemical structure of the resulting ionomers was confirmed by 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to investigate the thermal properties of the ionomers. Compared with that of neat PET, the initial decomposition temperature of PETIs decreased in a nitrogen atmosphere while it increased in air. The crystallinity of PETIs was enhanced firstly and then destroyed with the ionic group increase. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) test and cone calorimeter were used to characterize the flame-retardant properties of the ionomers. The results showed that the introduction of DHPPO-Na could endow an expected flame-retardant performance, meanwhile it considerably restricted the melt-dripping behavior and suppressed the smoke release. The rheology test confirmed that the ionic groups increased the melt viscosity via ionic aggregation during heating, which was a benefit for the flame-retardant property of the copolyester.

The results suggested that PES and PBS blocks are miscible in copolymers with shorter block lengths, while they are partially miscible in those with longer block lengths. The crystallization of PBS blocks were depressed with an increase in PES content due to the diluent effect, and that of PES blocks was largely restricted when its content was less than the PBS block, while that was improved when its content was more than that of the PBS block due to the nucleation effect of previously crystallized PBS.

Halogen-free flame-retardant flexible polyurethane foams (FPUF) were prepared successfully by using CMA as a flame retardant. The effects of CMA content on the mechanical, thermal, and flame-retardant properties of FPUF were investigated by tensile test, TGA, limiting oxygen index (LOI), flame propagation test (Cal T.B. 117A-Part I standard), and cone calorimeter. The foam morphology of FPUF was studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that CMA endowed FPUF with good flame-retardant properties. FPUF containing only 12 wt % CMA can pass Cal T.B. 117A-Part I standard, and its LOI value was increased from 18.2 (for FPUF without CMA) to 24.1. Particularly, the addition of CMA almost did not decrease the mechanical properties of the resulting flame-retardant FPUFs. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

In the present study, PLLA was successfully toughened by blending with a poly(lactic acid) based poly(ester-urethane) (PEU), which contained poly(butylene succinate) as a flexible segment. The tensile properties and notched Izod impact strength of PLLA and toughened PLLA were investigated.

The crystallization behavior was investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), polarized optical microscopy (POM), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The glass transition temperature of toughened PLLA decreased with an increasing content of PEU, suggesting that the blends showed limited miscibility.

In the present study, PLLA was blended with a novel biodegradable flexible multiblock copolymer, poly(butylene succinate-b-ethylene succinate) (PBES) to produce new biodegradable materials. PLLA/PBES blends with different composition were prepared by solution blending and casting method with chloroform as a mutual solvent. Miscibility, crystallization behavior, and mechanical properties of the blends were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and tensile tests. The results indicated that PLLA and PBES showed limited miscibility in the amorphous phase. The crystallization rate of PLLA was accelerated with the increase of PBES in the blends while the crystallization mechanism did not change. The results of tensile tests suggest that the blends showed longer elongation at break than neat PLLA.

        "abstract": "A novel and facile strategy, combining anisotropic micellization of amphiphilic crystalline-coil copolymer in water and reassembly during single spinneret electrospinning, was developed for preparing nanofibers with very fine core-shell structure. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene glycol-block-poly(p-dioxanone) (PEG-b-PPDO) were used as the shell and the crystallizable core layer, respectively. The core-shell structure could be controllably produced by altering concentration of PEG-b-PPDO, and the chain length of the PPDO block. The morphology of the nanofibers was investigated by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). X-ray rocking curve measurements were performed to investigate the degree of ordered alignment of the PPDO crystalline lamellae in the nanofiber. The results suggested that the morphology of nanoparticles in spinning solution plays very important role in determining the phase separation of nanofibers. The amphiphilic PEG-b-PPDO copolymer self-assembled into star anise nanoaggregates in water solution induced by the crystallization of PPDO blocks. When incorporated with PVA, the interaction between PVA and PEG-b-PPDO caused a morphological transition of the nanoaggregates from star anise to small flake. For flake-like particles, their flat surface is in favor of compact stacking of PPDO crystalline lamellae and interfusion of amorphous PPDO in the core of nanofibers, leading to a relatively ordered alignment of PPDO crystalline lamellae and well-defined core-shell phase separation. However, for star anise-like nanoaggregates, their multibranched morphology may inevitably prohibit the compact interfusion of PPDO phase, resulting in a random microphase separation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A series of poly[ p -dioxanone-(butylene succinate)] (PPDOBS) copolymers were prepared from p -dioxanone (PDO), 1,4-butanediol and succinate acids through a two-step process including the initial prepolymer preparation of poly( p -dioxanone)diol (PPDO-OH) and poly(butylene succinate)diol (PBS-OH) and the following copolymerization of the two kinds of prepolymers by coupling with hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). The molecular structures of the prepared PPDO-OH, PBS-OH and PPDOBS were characterized by hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H NMR). The crystallization of the copolymers was investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy (POM) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). It has been shown that the crystallization rate and the degree of crystallization increases with the increase of the weight fraction of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) blocks in the copolymers. In phosphate buffer solution with pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0C for 18 weeks, the hydrolytic degradation behaviors of the copolymers were studied. The changes of retention weight, water absorption, pH value, and surface morphologies with the degradation time showed that the hydrolytic degradation rate of PPDOBS could be controlled by adjusting the weight fraction of poly( p -dioxanone) (PPDO) and PBS blocks in the copolymers. The changes of the thermal properties of PPDOBS during the degradation were also investigated by DSC. Keywords Poly( p -dioxanone) Poly(butylene succinate) Poly[ p -dioxanone-(butylene succinate)] Hydrolytic degradation 1 Introduction Poly( p -dioxanone) (PPDO), a biodegradable aliphatic poly(ether-ester), has attracted more and more attentions for its excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility and bioabsorbability [1] . It has been used in medical field such as sutures, surgery repair materials and drug delivery systems [2\u20134] . In recent years, owing to the great progress on the catalytic synthesis technology of p -dioxanone (PDO) monomer from diethylene glycol [5] , the production cost of PDO as well as its polymer PPDO decreased significantly. At present, PPDO has been considered as a candidate not only for medical uses but also for universal uses, such as films, molded products, laminates, foams, non-woven material, adhesives and coatings [6\u20138] . However, due to its poor thermal stability, low crystallization rate, as well as sensitivity to moisture, the applications of PPDO are limited greatly [9\u201316] . Therefore, it is very important for PPDO to be modified. As a common and an effective method, copolymerization is often employed to improve the properties of polymer. In recent years, there were some reports on the copolymerization for PPDO with other aliphatic polyesters [17\u201322] . The copolymerization was carried out through three main methods as follows: the direct ring-opening copolymerization of PDO with other lactone; the ring-opening polymerization of PDO in the presence of macroinitiator; and the copolymerization of PPDO and other prepolymer by coupling with diisocyanate. Generally speaking, by using the former two methods, only the copolymer with low molecular weights can be obtained. For the direct ring-opening copolymerization, due to the significant difference in reactivity between PDO and the other lactone such as \u03b5-caprolactone, glycolide and lactide, high molecular weight copolymers are difficult to be obtained [17] . For the ring-opening polymerization in the presence of macroinitiator, it is only under the condition of the very low molar ratio of the macroinitiator to PDO (macroinitiator/PDO) that the copolymers obtained can have high molecular weight. However, in that case, the content of macroinitiator is too low to attain the aim of modifying PPDO. Higher molar ratio of macroinitiator/PDO is good for the copolymerization, but the copolymers obtained only have low molecular weight because of the existence of more active species. Li et al. [18] prepared poly(lactic acid-b- p -dioxanone) block copolymers from ring-opening polymerization of PDO in the presence of poly( l -lactic acid) (PLA) macroinitiators. The highest intrinsic viscosity of the block copolymers was only 0.97 dL/g. In addition, it was found that it was difficult to induce the ring-opening polymerization of PDO and no copolymer was obtained when the molar fraction of PLA exceeded 60%. For the copolymerization by coupling, high molecular weight copolymers can be easily obtained through the reaction of poly( p -dioxanone)diol with other dihydroxyl-terminated prepolymers using diisocyanate as chain-extender. The corresponding studies mainly focus on the copolymerization of PPDO and poly-\u03b5-caprolactone (PCL) [21,22] . Lendlein et al. [22] developed shape-memory copolymers with high molecular weight via coupling oligo( p -dioxanone)diol and oligo(\u03b5-caprolactone)diol with 2,2(4),4-trimethylhexanediisocyanate. The thermally induced shape-memory property at the temperature of about 40 \u00b0C endows this kind of copolymers with potential values in biomedical field, especially in smart degradable sutures applications. However, due to the sensitivity to temperature in dimensional stability, the thermally induced shape-memory property hampers greatly the applications as the universal materials, especially as environment-friendly materials. In order to widen the scope of the applications of PPDO, it is necessary to use another aliphatic polyesters to improve its properties through copolymerization. As one of the most representative and generally acknowledged biodegradable aliphatic polyester, poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), which has good degradability and excellent melt processability, has been used extensively [23\u201325] . Compared with PCL, PBS has a much higher melting point of 112\u2013114 \u00b0C. It is expected that the copolymer of PPDO and PBS may have better dimension stability at ambient temperature and more extensive applications than the copolymer of PPDO with PCL. Besides the excellent properties mentioned above, PBS is also a polymer with slow degradation rate by hydrolysis. Therefore, a combination with the fast hydrolysable polymer PPDO can allow the design of a range of new materials with different life times. With respect to the copolymerization of PPDO and PBS, Zhang et al. [20] developed a novel biodegradable copolymer from chain-extension of PPDO with PBS. It was found that PPDO had good compatibility with PBS, and the copolymer had better thermal stability than PPDO. However, there are some defects with respect to the synthetic method. For a coupling agent for hydroxyl-adding type of toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI), in order to obtain high molecular weight copolymer, the coupling reaction must be carried out at high temperature (180 \u00b0C) for long time (6 h) because of none dihydroxyl-terminated prepolymers of both PPDO and PBS. In that case, the resulting copolymers were not only deeply colored but also seriously cross-linked, and there were little values in practical applications. In order to avoid those shortcomings, a new synthetic route was presented. In the present paper, poly[ p -dioxanone-(butylene succinate)] (PPDOBS) copolymers with higher molecular weight were prepared through a two-step process including the initial prepolymer preparation of poly( p -dioxanone)diol and poly(butylene succinate)diol and the following copolymerization of the two kinds of prepolymers by coupling with hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). The molecular structures of the prepared poly( p -dioxanone)diol, poly(butylene succinate)diol and the copolymer PPDOBS were characterized by 1 H NMR. The crystallization of PPDOBS was investigated by using DSC, POM and WAXD. In addition, a hydrolysis degradation was performed in phosphate buffer solution with pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0C and the water absorption, retention weight, pH value, thermal properties, and surface morphologies were monitored during the degradation process. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials p -Dioxanone (PDO), provided by the Pilot Plant of the Center for Degradable and Flame-Retardant Polymeric Materials (Chengdu, China), was dried over CaH 2 for 48 h and distilled under reduced pressure before use. Stannous octoate (\u2a7e95%) and tetrabutyl titanate (AR grade) were purchased from Sigma (USA) and Kelong Chemical Corporation (Chengdu, China), respectively, and used as received. After diluted with anhydrous toluene, SnOct 2 solution and Ti(OBu) 4 solution were stored in the glass ampoules under nitrogen. 1,6-Hexamethylene diisocyanate (AR grade) from Sigma (USA), 1,4-butanediol (AR grade) and succinic acid (AR grade) from Zhiyuan Chemical Company (Tianjin, China) were used without further purification. All other chemicals with AR grades were used as received. 2.2 Preparation of dihydroxyl-terminated prepolymers Poly( p -dioxanone)diol (PPDO-OH) prepolymer was prepared through bulk ring-opening polymerization of PDO using 1,4-butanediol (BD) as an initiator, and SnOct 2 as a catalyst. The preparation was performed in a flame-dried glass reactor with magnetic stirring. The reactor was evacuated and purged with nitrogen three times prior to addition of PDO and BD with syringe. The molar ratio of PDO to BD was fixed at 40. The reactor was immersed into an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C with stirring for 10 min. Then SnOct 2 solution was injected into the reactor using the molar ratio of BD to SnOct 2 with 1000. After 72 h at 80 \u00b0C, the reactor was cooled down rapidly to room temperature. The product obtained was milled into small chips, then dried under vacuum at 40 \u00b0C to a constant weight and stored in a desiccator over silica gel. The preparation route for PPDO-OH was shown in Scheme 1 a. Poly(butylene succinate)diol (PBS-OH) prepolymer was prepared via a two-step procedure including esterification and following polycondensation. First, 1.0 mol succinic acid and 1.2 mol 1,4-butanediol were added into a 500 mL three-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a Dean\u2013Stark water separator and a nitrogen inlet pipe. The esterification was carried out at 200 \u00b0C for 4 h. Then, the catalyst tetrabutyl titanate with 0.1 wt.% of the total amount of reactants was introduced into the flask with a syringe. The polycondensation was continued at 230 \u00b0C with vacuum of 30 Pa for 2 h. The viscous liquid product was cooled down to room temperature under nitrogen flow. The resulting polymer was milled into small chips, then dried under vacuum at 40 \u00b0C to a constant weight and stored in a desiccator over silica gel. The preparation route for PBS-OH was shown in Scheme 1 b. 2.3 Preparation of poly[ p -dioxanone-(butylene succinate)] (PPDOBS) copolymers PPDOBS copolymers were prepared by coupling PPDO-OH and PBS-OH with 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). The preparation route was shown in Scheme 1 c. The coupling reaction was performed in bulk using a glass reactor under nitrogen atmosphere. PPDO-OH and PBS-OH were added into the reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a nitrogen inlet pipe. The reactor was evacuated and purged with nitrogen three times. Then the reactor was immersed into a silicone oil bath at 160 \u00b0C. When the prepolymers were melted completely, HDI was injected with a syringe into the reactor using the molar ratio of HDI to the total amount of the prepolymers with 1.1. The coupling reaction proceeded for 1 h with a continuous nitrogen flow. Then the reactor was cooled down rapidly to room temperature. The copolymer obtained was milled into small chips, then dried under vacuum at 40 \u00b0C to a constant weight and stored in a desiccator over silica gel. 2.4 Characterization 2.4.1 Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) The molecular weights of PPDO-OH and PBS-OH prepolymers were determined at 35 \u00b0C by GPC, using a Waters GPC device equipped with a 1515 pump, a Waters model 717 autosampler, and a 2414 refractive index detector. Chloroform was employed as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and a sample concentration of 2.5 mg/mL was used. The number and weight average molecular weights ( M n,GPC and M w,GPC , respectively) were calculated by using a calibration curve which was obtained by monodisperse polystyrene standards. 2.4.2 Intrinsic viscosity As the conventional solvents such as chloroform and tetrahydrofuran used in GPC measurement can not dissolve PPDOBS, only the intrinsic viscosity ([ \u03b7 ]) of 0.1% w/v solution of PPDOBS in phenol/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (1:1 v/v) was measured at 25 \u00b0C in a constant temperature water bath using an Ubbelohde viscometer. Prior to measurement, the solution was filtered through a quantitative filter paper. 2.4.3 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy 1 H NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Inova 400 spectrometer and performed at ambient temperature with 5% (w/v) polymer solution in CDCl 3 for prepolymers and in DMSO for PPDOBS, and tetramethylsilane was used as the internal reference. The number-average molecular weights ( M n,NMR ) of PPDO-OH and PBS-OH were calculated from the NMR analysis. 2.4.4 Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) WAXD experiments were conducted with Cu K\u03b1 radiation on a Philips X\u2019Pert Pro X-ray apparatus (Holland). The equipment was operated at 40 kV and 35 mA under room tempeture, and the scan range was between 2\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 with a scan rate of 2\u00b0/min. 2.4.5 Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) DSC measurement was performed with Q100 apparatus (TA Corporation, USA) in sealed aluminum pan under nitrogen atmosphere. The samples were quickly heated to 140 \u00b0C, kept for 5 min to eliminate the thermal history, and then cooled to \u221250 \u00b0C at a cooling rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. The samples were again heated up to 140 \u00b0C at the same rate. The glass transition temperature ( T g ), melting enthalpies, and the melting temperature ( T m ) were obtained from the thermogram. 2.4.6 Polar optical microscopy (POM) POM was carried out with a Nikon ECLIPSE LV 100POL microscope in conjunction with a hot stage (HSC621V). Samples were melted in glass slides with cover slips to form thin films. The specimens were heated to 140 \u00b0C on a hot plate holding for 3 min and then quickly cooled to the required crystallization temperature. The growth of spherulites was recorded on a video cassette recorder. 2.5 Hydrolytic degradation The hydrolytic degradation tests were carried out in a phosphate buffer solution with pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0C. The films, which were prepared by compression molding at 140 \u00b0C first and then cooled at room temperature rapidly, were cut into 20 \u00d7 10 mm 2 slabs with a thickness of 0.5 mm. Before immersed in the buffer solution, each sample was weighed on a Mettler analytical balance (AL204). Three samples were taken out of the hydrolysis medium and rinsed with distilled water to remove the phosphate every week. After wiping, the three samples were weighed first and then dried under vacuum at ambient temperature to constant weight. Before continuing the experiment, the buffer solution was renewed. Total remaining weight and water absorption were calculated from the following relationships: retention weight% = m t / m 0 , water absorption% = ( m w \u2212 m t )/ m t , where m 0 and m t represented the initial and remaining weights of the dried samples, and m w represented the wet weight of the samples after wiping. The values of the retention weight and water absorption were given by means of the average measurement value of the three samples. pH changes were measured by a Leici pH meter (PHS-3C). SEM evaluation was carried out to examine the surface morphology of the samples by using JSM-5900LV (JEOL Corporation, Japan). DSC analysis was used to determine the changes in thermal characteristics of the samples with the hydrolysis time. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation of PPDO-OH and PBS-OH prepolymers By reference to the literature [26] , the dihydroxyl-terminated PPDO-OH prepolymer was prepared via ring-opening polymerization of PDO by using 1,4-butanediol as an initiator and SnOct 2 as a catalyst. The molecular structure of PPDO-OH was characterized by 1 H NMR, and the spectrum was shown in Fig. 1 a. The resonance signals belonging to the three kinds of methylene protons in the repeating PPDO units were observed at 4.16 (\u03b4H a ), 3.78 (\u03b4H b ) and 4.33 (\u03b4H c ) ppm. The shifts occurring at 1.71 (\u03b4H d ) and 4.12 (\u03b4H e ) ppm with the same integral area were assigned to the methylene protons of BD, while the shifts observed at 3.76 (\u03b4H b\u2032 ) and 3.68 (\u03b4H c\u2032 ) ppm were ascribed to the methylene protons connecting with the terminal hydroxyl groups. From the data of 1 H NMR, the number-average molecular weight of PPDO-OH ( M n,NMR ) can be calculated according to the following equation: (1) M n,NMR = 102 \u00d7 I 4.33 + I 3.68 I 3.68 + 88 + 2 where I 4.33 and I 3.68 were the peak intensities of the corresponding methylene protons, the values of 102, 88, and 2 were the molecular weights of the repeating unit of PPDO, -OCH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 O-, and two hydrogen protons at the ends of the molecular chain, respectively. M n,NMR of PPDO-OH prepolymer obtained by 1 H NMR is listed in Table 1 . By using GPC, the molecular weights of PPDO-OH were also determined (shown in Table 1 ). M n,GPC of PPDO-OH was much higher than M n,NMR . This difference may be ascribed to the different measurement method. Between M n,NMR and M n,GPC , it was found that M n,NMR was very effective to determine the amount of coupling agent [27,28] . Therefore, in the following coupling reaction, M n,NMR was employed to calculate the use level of HDI. The dihydroxyl-terminated PBS-OH prepolymer was prepared by the polycondensation of succinic acid with excessive 1,4-butanediol using Ti(OBu) 4 as a catalyst [29] . Fig. 1 b shows the 1 H NMR spectrum of PBS-OH. Besides the typical proton resonance signals belonging to the repeating units of PBS at 4.13 (\u03b4H e ), 2.64 (\u03b4H f ) and 1.74 (\u03b4H d ) ppm, the proton resonance signal occurring at 3.67 (\u03b4H g ) ppm can be assigned to the methylene protons connecting with the terminal hydroxyl groups. No additional carboxyl group resonance signal was detected within the instrumental limit. By 1 H NMR analysis, the number-average molecular weight of PBS-OH can be obtained according to the following equation: (2) M n,NMR = 172 \u00d7 I 4.10 I 3.65 + 89 + 1 where I 4.10 and I 3.65 were the peak intensities of the corresponding methylene protons, the values of 172, 89, and 1 were the molecular weights of the repeating unit of PBS, -OCH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 OH, and the hydrogen proton at the end of the molecular chain, respectively. The values of M n,NMR and M n,GPC are listed in Table 1 . Just like PPDO-OH, PBS-OH has also the much higher value of M n,GPC than that of M n,NMR . 3.2 Preparation of PPDOBS copolymers PPDOBS copolymers with different composition were prepared via coupling reaction of PPDO-OH with PBS-OH by using HDI as a coupling agent at 160 \u00b0C for 1 h. Compared with the reaction conditions used by Zhang et al. [20] , the reaction time was much shorter and the reaction temperature was also lower. This is good for the coupling reaction. In order to obtain better insight into the copolymers, the homopolymer only containing PPDO or PBS was also prepared by using PPDO-OH or PBS-OH as the single prepolymer to react with HDI, and remarked as PPDO-H and PBS-H, respectively. The weight fractions of PPDO in PPDOBS copolymers varied from 20 to 90 wt.%. The samples containing 20, 50, 70 and 90 wt.% PPDO are denoted as PPDOBS2, PPDOBS5, PPDOBS7 and PPDOBS9, respectively. The structure of the copolymer was characterized by 1 H NMR. Fig. 1 c indicates the 1 H NMR spectrum of PPDOBS7. It was found that the characteristic chemical shifts ascribed to PPDO (\u03b4H a , \u03b4H b and \u03b4H c ) and PBS (\u03b4H d , \u03b4H e and \u03b4H f ) still occurred in the 1 H NMR spectrum of PPDOBS7. In addition, the shifts of three kinds of methylene protons of HDI, as well as the proton in \u2013NH\u2013 group were observed at 1.22 (\u03b4H j ), 1.36 (\u03b4H i ), 2.94 (\u03b4H h ) and 7.20 (\u03b4H k ) ppm. After coupling reaction, the shifts at 3.65, 3.76 and 3.68 ppm ascribed to the methylene protons connecting with the terminal hydroxyl of prepolymers disappeared, indicating that the coupling reaction proceeded completely. Regretfully, GPC measurement of the copolymers can not be performed due to the poor solubility of PPDOBS in the conventional solvents such as chloroform and tetrahydrofuran. Only the intrinsic viscosities ([ \u03b7 ]) of the resulting polymers were measured for a relative comparison, and the corresponding data were listed in Table 2 . The intrinsic viscosities of the resulting polymers are more than 10 times higher than those of the prepolymers, indicating that the coupling reaction is very effective. 3.3 Thermal properties and crystallization of PPDOBS copolymers WAXD was employed to investigate the crystal structures of the samples. The WXRD diffraction patterns of PPDOBS, as well as PBS-H and PPDO-H samples are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that both PPDO-H and PBS-H have two obvious diffraction peaks at 2 \u03b8 of 21.9\u00b0, 23.6\u00b0, and 19.6\u00b0, 22.8\u00b0, respectively. With respect to PPDOBS9, although the weight fraction of PBS blocks is only 10 wt.%, a weak diffraction peak originating from PBS blocks at 2 \u03b8 of 19.6\u00b0 can still be detected. The X-ray diffraction peaks at 2 \u03b8 of 21.9\u00b0, 23.6\u00b0, 19.6\u00b0, and 22.8\u00b0 originating from PPDO and PBS blocks appear also in the other copolymers. This result revealed that PBS and PPDO blocks in the copolymers formed the well self-assembled crystal structures corresponding to PBS-H and PPDO-H types. In addition, the peaks for PPDOBS were less sharp than those of PBS-H and PPDO-H. From PPDOBS9 to PPDOBS2, the peak intensities of PPDO blocks became weaker with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks, while those of PBS blocks varied in the opposite direction. The spherulitic morphologies of the samples were investigated by POM. When PPDO-H and PBS-H crystallized from melt, they formed well-defined spherulites that can exhibit Maltese crosses extinction pattern between crossed polars, which depends on the crystallization temperature and time. Fig. 3 a shows the optical micrograph of PPDO-H after isothermal crystallization at 60 \u00b0C for 5 min, and Fig. 3 b indicates the optical micrograph of PBS-H after isothermal crystallization at 70 \u00b0C for 1 min. Obviously, the crystallization rate of PBS-H was much higher than that of PPDO-H even at higher temperature. It is well known that there are two key factors that control the overall crystallization rate, one is the nucleation and the other is the crystal growth [30] . Nucleation is a decreasing function of temperature; however, crystal growth is an increasing function of temperature. When the temperature is appropriate, the rates of nucleation and crystal growth are both high enough, the crystallization rate reaches the maximum. Due to the high crystallization rate of PBS, it can be expected that PPDOBS copolymers have higher crystallization rate than PPDO-H, which will be discussed later. The average spherulite size also depends on the rate of nucleation and growth. When more nuclei are present, more spherulites are formed and the spherulite size becomes smaller at the end of the crystallization process [31] . Fig. 4 shows the optical micrographs of PPDOBS obtained from the isothermal crystallization at 60 \u00b0C for various time. All micrographs display the typical Maltese crosses, and the nucleation densities of PPDOBS copolymers are much higher than that of PPDO-H ( Fig. 3 a). From Fig. 3 a, Fig. 4 a, and Fig. 4 b, it can be observed that the average spherulite size gradually decreases from PPDO-H to PPDOBS9 and to PPDOBS7, while the corresponding nucleation density increases in the same order, implying that PBS blocks play a role of nucleation. Similar nucleating effect in PPDO-b-PCL diblock copolymers was reported by Albuerne et al. [32,33] , who found that both PPDO and PCL blocks can crystallize in a supercooling range during the isothermal crystallization. PPDO blocks crystallized first and nucleated PCL blocks. Therefore, the trend of decreasing first and then increasing with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks in the average spherulite size of PPDOBS copolymers, which can be observed in Fig. 4 , can be attributed to the crystallization of PBS blocks that provide different amounts of nuclei. With increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks from 10 to 30 wt.%, the more crystalline PBS blocks acted as the nucleating agents, and so the average spherulite size decreased. However, when the weight fraction of PBS blocks exceeded 50 wt.%, the self-crystallization of PBS blocks was dominant, resulting in a decrease of the amounts of nuclei for PPDO blocks crystallization. As a result, the average spherulites size of PPDOBS5 and PPDOBS2 increased. When the weight fraction of PBS blocks increased from 10 to 80 wt.%, the crystallization rate of the copolymers increased in the order of PPDOBS9, PPDOBS7, PPDOBS5 and PPDOBS2. This result shows that the crystallization rate of the copolymer increases with increasing the weight fraction of the PBS blocks. This is mainly ascribed to the high crystallization rate of PBS blocks and the significant nucleating effect of the crystalline PBS blocks. The thermal properties of PPDO-H, PBS-H, and PPDOBS were studied by DSC. The DSC curves are shown in Fig. 5 . The glass transition temperature ( T g ), melting point ( T m ), and melting enthalpy (\u0394 H m ) evaluated from the heating scan are listed in Table 3 . The degrees of crystallization ( X c ) of PPDO and PBS blocks are also given, which are calculated from the following equation: (3) X C = \u0394 H m \u0394 H m 0 A \u00d7 A ( wt % ) where \u0394 H m 0 A is the melting enthalpy per gram of the polymer in its completely crystalline state (\u0394 H m 0 PPDO = 141 J/g [34] , \u0394 H m 0 PBS = 110 J/g [35] ) and A (wt.%) is the mass percent of the A component. From Fig. 5 , it can be observed that all DSC curves of PPDOBS showed only one glass transition regardless of the composition. The occurrence of a single glass transition step indicated that the amorphous chain ascribed to PBS and PPDO blocks were mixed well, thus leading to the formation of a miscible amorphous phase. In addition, two melting peaks were detected in the heating curves ( Fig. 5 b), which suggested that both PPDO and PBS blocks crystallized and formed two different crystal domains in PPDOBS copolymers. These results are in good agreement with those obtained from WAXD analyses. When the weight fraction of PBS blocks exceeded 10 wt.%, the samples displayed the crystallization peaks in the cooling scan and no crystallization peak was detected in the heating scan, indicating the complete crystallization during the cooling process. It has been shown that the crystallization rate of PPDOBS copolymer increased with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks. This result is in accordance with that obtained from POM analyses. The crystallization peaks of PBS blocks appeared over the temperature of 50 \u00b0C during the cooling process ( Fig. 5 a) and shifted gradually to the higher temperature with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks. The corresponding crystallization enthalpy also increased. This may be attributed to the increase in crystallization capacity of PBS blocks with increasing PBS content. With respect to PPDOBS9, in which the weight fraction of PBS blocks was only 10 wt.%, the crystallization enthalpy was so small that the crystallization peak was not appeared on the DSC curve during the cooling process. For PPDOBS7, PPDOBS5, PPDOBS2, and PBS-H, in which the weight fraction of PBS blocks increased from 30 to 100 wt.%, the X c of PBS blocks gradually increased from 31.2% to 47.3% ( Table 3 ), while the X c of PBS blocks in PPDOBS9 was only 2.7%. From Table 3 , it can also be seen that all copolymers had a single T g , which fell between the glass transitions of \u221218.0 \u00b0C for PPDO-H and \u221235.0 \u00b0C for PBS-H. The shift of T g indicates that PPDO and PBS could be miscible in the amorphous phase. Otherwise, two T g s corresponding to each polymer would be detected. In addition, the T m s of both PPDO and PBS blocks were remained and changed slightly, indicating that the composition of PPDOBS had little or no effect on T m of the copolymers. The X c of PPDO blocks in the copolymers increased from 8.0% to 24.9% with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks from 0 to 30 wt.%. With the further increase to 50 wt.%, the X c of PPDO blocks decreased to 19.1%. This decrease was in good accordance with the variation of the crystallization enthalpy of PPDO blocks from PPDOBS7 to PPDOBS5 during the cooling process ( Fig. 5 a). When the weight fraction of PBS blocks reached to 80 wt.%, the melting peak of PPDO blocks nearly disappeared. From PPDO-H to PPDOBS2, the trend of increasing first and then decreasing in the X c of PPDO blocks was just opposite to that of decreasing first and then increasing in the average spherulite size measured by POM. This can be also ascribed to the changes in nucleating effect of the crystalline PBS blocks. When the weight fraction of PBS blocks was low, the crystallization of PBS blocks acted as the nuclei for PPDO blocks crystallization, and the X c of PPDO blocks increased with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks. While the weight fraction of PBS blocks increased to 50 wt.%, the self-crystallization of PBS blocks is dominant, and the crystallization of PPDO blocks was confined. As a result, the X c of PPDO blocks decreased. As can be seen from the results obtained by WAXD, POM and DSC, PBS blocks crystallize first and then nucleate for PPDO blocks crystallization, and the crystallization rate of PPDO blocks increases with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks. 3.4 Hydrolytic degradation 3.4.1 Degradation In order to investigate the hydrolysis behaviors of PPDOBS copolymers, the hydrolytic degradation was carried out in a phosphate buffer solution with pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0C. As is well known, the biodegradability of aliphatic polyesters depends mainly on their chemical structures, especially on the hydrolysable ester bonds in the main chains which are susceptible to water attacks. When the samples are in contact with the aqueous medium, water absorption is the first thing. After water diffuses into the samples, hydrolysis of ester bonds begins. As the hydrolysis proceeds, the fragments of low molecular chains which are soluble in the hydrolysis medium produce. When the degraded fragments diffuse and dissolve in the aqueous medium, a weight loss of the samples and decrease of pH of the solution occurs. At the same time, the migration of fragments encourages the absorption of water as water fills the spaces left behind. Due to the different chemical structure of PPDO and PBS blocks, the copolymer with various composition will exhibit different degradation properties during the hydrolysis. Fig. 6 shows the evolution of water absorption with the degradation time. As can be seen, the water absorption profiles of the samples increased as the degradation proceeded. There was a dramatic increase of water absorption for PPDO-H from 4th week to 18th week and 31 \u00b1 2% of water absorption had attained after 18 weeks, while the water absorption of PBS-H varied within 3% for 18 weeks. In the same time span, PPDOBS9, PPDOBS7, PPDOBS5 and PPDOBS2 had the final water absorption of 24 \u00b1 2, 18 \u00b1 2, 15 \u00b1 1 and 5 \u00b1 1%, respectively. The water absorption of PPDOBS copolymers decreased with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks, and varied between the water absorption of PBS-OH and PPDO-OH. The pH value of buffer solution was monitored and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . With the increase of hydrolysis time, pH values of the samples decreased. With respect to PPDO-H, the pH value decreased slowly in the first few weeks, but after the initial 4 weeks, it decreased rapidly and a sharp drop occurred from 12th to 18th week, and a final pH value of 4.05 was obtained after 18 weeks. Similar results had been observed for PPDO [36,37] . While the pH value of PBS-H decreased so slowly that no significant change was observed, and the final pH value was only 7.34. With respect to PPDOBS copolymers, the pH value decreased slower than that of PPDO-H, and increased regularly with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks, which is in concordance with the water absorption results shown in Fig. 6 . pH value of the copolymers varied between that of PPDO-H and PBS-H, and the final pH value regularly increased from 4.76 to 6.74 after 18 weeks when the weight fraction of PBS blocks increased from 10 to 80 wt.%. The decrease of pH value suggested that the hydrolysis of the samples produces acid molecules with low molecular weight. It is also seen from the drop that the degradation accelerated after 4th week, probably because of the autocatalysis of carboxyl groups [38] . Weight loss is a simple evaluation for the hydrolysis progress of polymers during the exposure to the hydrolytic medium. Fig. 8 shows the retention weight of the samples as a function of the degradation time. The retention weight of PPDO-H decreased rapidly after 4 weeks, and had a weight loss of 16 \u00b1 2% at 10th week. This result is lower than that reported by Sabino et al. [36] who found a weight loss of 25% after 10 weeks of degradation in phosphate buffer solution of pH 7.44 at 37 \u00b0C. It may be ascribed to the incorporation of chain-extender, since it has been reported that the presence of urethane bonds in the chain-extended polyesters makes them degrade slower than the original polyesters [39] . During the period investigated, PPDO-H lost its weight faster than PPDOBS copolymers, especially after 4 weeks, and a final weight loss of 36 \u00b1 3% was gotten after 18 weeks. While the weight loss of PBS-H remains almost unchanged during the course of hydrolytic degradation, and only varied within 3%. After 18 weeks, the final weight loss of PPDOBS9, PPDOBS7, PPDOBS5 and PPDOBS2 were 31 \u00b1 2, 19 \u00b1 2, 17 \u00b1 1 and 8 \u00b1 1%, respectively. The weight loss increased with the degradation time for PPDOBS copolymers, and decreased with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks. From the above results, it can be seen that the hydrolytic degradation rate of PPDOBS could be controlled by adjusting the weight fraction of PPDO and PBS blocks in the copolymers. 3.4.2 Scanning electronic microscopy While the hydrolysis progresses, the fragments of chains involved in the hydrolysis can migrate into the aqueous medium, leaving empty spaces on the surface of the sample. The cracks on the surface can be detected by SEM [36] . For the different hydrolysis properties of PPDO and PBS blocks, some morphological differences probably exist among the copolymers as the hydrolysis proceeds. Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show the SEM micrographs of PPDO-H, PPDOBS9, PPDOBS7 and PPDOBS5 after various degradation time. After 8 weeks, some cracks were detected on the surface of PPDO-H, and there was only one crack for PPDOBS9 and PPDOBS7. While for PPDOBS5, no cracks were observed on the surface. When the micrographs of the cracks were magnified 10,000 times ( Fig. 10 ), some filaments connecting the both side of the cracks can be observed for PPDOBS7. With further degradation, the number of the cracks increased. But for PPDOBS5, no cracks were detected even after 14 weeks. The physical integrity of the samples became better with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks in the copolymers. The surface morphologic changes also indicate that the hydrolytic degradation can be controlled by changing the weight fraction of PPDO and PBS blocks. 3.4.3 Thermal analysis The ester bonds in the aliphatic polyesters are sensitive when suffering from water. Their cleavage occurs first in the amorphous areas during the hydrolytic degradation. The short chains involved in the breaking can incorporate into the crystal, causing an increase in crystallization at the initial stage of hydrolysis; at the later stage of hydrolysis, most of hydrolysis occurs in the crystal regions and gradually destroys these regions [36,37,40,41] . In this section, the crystallization in the hydrolytic degradation process has been investigated. The samples of PPDO-H, PPDOBS7 and PBS-H were characterized by DSC to evaluate the variation of melting peak temperature ( T m ) and melting enthalpy (\u0394 H m ) as a function of the degradation time. The degrees of crystallization ( X c ) was calculated by Eq. (3) . Fig. 11 shows the DSC heating curves of PPDO-H, PPDOBS7, and PBS-H. The corresponding data obtained from DSC curves were listed in Table 4 . As can be observed, T m , \u0394 H m , and X c increased with the degradation time. After 9 weeks, the melting point of PPDO-H increased from 84.4 to 96.0 \u00b0C, and the corresponding value of PBS-H increased from 106.6 to 109.1 \u00b0C. The melting point of PPDO blocks in PPDOBS7 increased from 84.8 to 94.7 \u00b0C, while that of PBS blocks increased from 103.5 to 109.3 \u00b0C. It can be also seen that X c of PPDO-H increased from 8.0% to 39.2% after 9 weeks, while the corresponding crystallinity of PPDO blocks in PPDOBS7 increased from 24.9% to 29.4%. With respect to PBS blocks in PPDOBS7 and PBS-H, the initial degrees of crystallization were 31.2% and 31.8%, and increased to 39.1% and 39.3%, respectively, after 9 weeks. The increase in crystallinity can be explained by the \u201ccleavage-induced crystallization\u201d mechanism [42,43] . When water diffuses into the samples, the attack happens on both amorphous and crystalline areas, but preferentially on the amorphous areas because of their less density. Then chain scission occurs and subsequently results in less entangled chain segments. These short segments can organize themselves to the crystal at the employed hydrolysis temperature (above the T g of PPDO and PBS), which causes an increase in crystallinity. 4 Conclusions PPODBS copolymers with different composition were prepared through a two-step process including preparation of PPDO-OH and PBS-OH prepolymers and the following copolymerization of the two kinds of prepolymers by coupling with HDI. The molecular structures of the prepared prepolymers and copolymers were characterized by means of 1 H NMR. Compared with the prepolymers, the intrinsic viscosities of PPDOBS copolymers increased by 10 times at least. WAXD analysis showed that the crystalline form of PPDO and PBS blocks in the copolymers was the same as that of the corresponding homopolymer. POM analysis indicated that PBS blocks crystallized first and acted as a nucleating agent for PPDO blocks crystallization. The crystallization rate of PPDOBS copolymers increased with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks. The appearance of one T g and two T m detected by DSC suggested that PPDO and PBS blocks were compatible in the amorphous regions but separated in the crystal domains. During the hydrolytic degradation, the pH value, water absorption, retention weight, and physical integrity varied regularly with increasing the weight fraction of PBS blocks. All the results of hydrolytic degradation showed that the hydrolytic degradation rate of PPDOBS could be controlled by adjusting the weight fraction of PPDO and PBS blocks in the copolymers.

        "abstract": "In this work, flame-retardant ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) composites were prepared by incorporating intumescent flame-retardant (IFR) together with two different organically modified layered nanoparticles: montmorillonite (OMMT) and layered double hydroxides (OLDH). The morphology, fire behavior, thermal stability, flame-retardant synergism, and mechanical properties of the flame-retardant EPDM nanocomposites were studied. The introduction of a certain amount of OMMT (or OLDH) in the intumescent flame-retardant EPDM led to the considerable enhancement of flame retardance, thermal stability, and mechanical properties. Especially, the EPDM-IFR30-OLDH2 composite (100 phr EPDM, 30 phr IFR, and 2 phr OLDH) presented the highest tensile strength and could pass a UL-94 test V-0 rating; while the EPDM-IFR30-OMMT2 composite (100 phr EPDM, 30 phr IFR, and 2 phr OMMT) showed the lowest peak heat release rate (pHRR) and total heat release (THR) values. Different flame-retardant performances should be attributed to their own characteristics, dispersion state in EPDM matrix, and the change of structure during burning. The flame-retardant mechanisms for the composites were proposed to be condensed phase activity. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

The structure, molecular weight, and physical properties of the PEUs were investigated by 1H NMR, GPC, DSC, WAXD, DMA, and tensile tests. The results suggest that the compositions affect the physical properties more significantly than the segment lengths. The PEU containing 28.2 wt % PBS showed the best mechanical properties with ultimate strength and elongation at break of 41 MPa and 1503%, respectively. Both the storage modulus and Young's modulus increased significantly with increasing PBS segment content, which was reasonably ascribed to the increasing degree of crystallinity. The hysteresis value increased with PBS segment content while it decreased slightly with lengths of both hard and soft segments, which were also attributed to the different crystallization behaviors of the PEUs. ? 2014 American Chemical Society.",

The flame-retardant polypropylene composite was characterized by limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94, the cone calorimeter (CCT), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to study the combustion behavior and thermal stability. The addition of 0.5% sepiolite increased the LOI from 29.8 to 31.8. The addition of sepiolite at a low additive amount appears to be an optimum blend ratio for the low heat release rate, total smoke, and CO 2 production. Sepiolite also has a significant improvement in mechanical properties. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

The non-isothermal crystallization is also important for the practicaluse since they are usually processed under non-isothermal conditions. Therefore, in the present paperwe exclusively investigated the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of P(BS-co-DEGS) and comparedwith that of neat PBS using differential scanning calorimeter. Three classical methods including Avrami,Ozawa, and Mo's equations have been used to analyze the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of neatPBS and P(BS-co-DEGS) copolymers. The results suggest that both Avrami and Mo's methods are suitablewhile Ozawa method is not suitable to describe the non-isothermal crystallization of the polymers. Thecrystallization rate decreased gradually with increase in the content of DEGS while the crystallizationmechanism almost kept unchanged. The non-isothermal crystallization activation energies were eval-uated by Vyazovkin method and the results are in accordance with those obtained by other methods. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

With increasing the addition amount of boron trifluoride, the molecular weight of PCL decreases; the molecular weight distribution is broadened; and the degree of crystallinity of PCL increases at first at low BF3 level, then decreases when BF3 content exceeds to 2.64\u00a0wt%.

A typical procedure is as follows: the PCL prepolymers are first prepared by the ring opening polymerization of \u03b5-CL with AlEt 3 as initiators at 50\u00b0C for 1 h, and they are dissolved in toluene, then PDO monomers are added into the solutions of the resulting PCL prepolymers (as the living macroinitiator) in toluene, and finally are polymerized at 25\u00b0C for 36 h, resulting the P(CL-b-PDO) copolymers. The structure and molar fraction of the copolymers were determined by 1H-NMR spectrum. The thermal behavior of the P(CL-b-PDO) copolymers was studied by DSC. Two well-distinct melting temperatures are detected in all three samples with different compositions. Only when the content of PCL block reaches 31%, two glass transition temperatures can be found; otherwise only one glass transition temperature for PPDO block can be detected as the content of PCL block is too low. Finally, the thermal degradation of the P(CL-b-PDO) block copolymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analyses. The degradation occurs in two consecutive steps involving a first unzipping depolymerization of the PPDO blocks followed by the degradation of the PCL blocks.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the degradability of thermoplastic starch (TPS) and thermoplastic dialdehyde starch (TPDAS) under controlled composting conditions was investigated and a manual set-up was built according to ISO 14855 for this purpose. Chemical modification of starch can have a major impact on the biodegradation rate and final biodegradation percentage. The TPS degraded faster than TPDAS under controlled composting conditions. For the TPDAS, the degradation rate and final biodegradation percentage were closely related to the degree of oxidation of dialdehyde starch (DAS). The possible reason was also discussed. The biodegradation process of TPS and TPDAS exhibited three phases or stages with different degradation speeds. The biodegradation in the first phase was slow, accelerated in the second phase and leveled off in the third phase. Three kinds of actinomycete were isolated from the compost and identified as micromonospora, nocardia and streptomycete, which were degrading microorganisms of the starch tested. The abilities of these strains to decompose the TPS and TPDAS were also discussed.",

        "abstract": "A facile method to develop electro-induced shape memory polymer composites with good location- and process-controlled shape recovery performance is proposed. The poly(butylene succinate) (PBS)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) multiblock copolymer (PBSEG), which has excellent flexibility, was chosen as the matrix of the composites. The conducting medium, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), was introduced to this copolymer by in situ polycondensation. The fine dispersion of CNTs in the PBSEG matrix, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, enabled it to form a percolation network when only 0.5 wt% filler was loaded. DSC analysis revealed another important role played by CNTs in this system, as a nucleating agent for both PBS and PEG segments, and it caused an increase in crystallization temperature and crystallinity of both segments. The tensile properties test showed that the nanocomposite still exhibits good ductility with the addition of no more than 1 wt% CNTs, which allows it to undergo large deformation during shape programming. The electrical actuation shape memory performance was evaluated by a bending test, and the recovery process was recorded with a camera and an infrared video camera. The effect of CNTs loading, segment content and chain length upon the fixity ratio, recovery ratio and speed was studied, and the temporary shape control and localized shape memory response were also investigated. The results showed that the PBSEG/CNTs nanocomposites possess good shape memory performance with high shape fixity (more than 93.77%) and recovery ratio (more than 97.04%), and the shape recovery process can be adjusted by tailoring the polymer chain structure, the content of CNTs and the mode of how the samples are put in a circuit. In present work, we successfully achieved an electro-induced shape memory device which can be well controlled to remain at any stage during the recovery process and respond at any local position.

        "abstract": "The morphological evolution and phase transition of a branched crystalline-coil multi-block copolymer, poly(p-dioxanone)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PPDOstar-b-PEG), in aqueous solution under heating and cooling were investigated. The changes in size and morphology of the nano-aggregates were monitored by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A semitransparent and uniform dispersion of nano-aggregates with star anise-like morphology was obtained from PPDOstar-b-PEG at room temperature. The dispersion gradually turned transparent during heating to 80 \u00b0C because of the melting of the crystallized PPDO blocks. The crystals with low regularity melted first leading to dissociation of the star anise nano-aggregates to flake-like particles. The copolymer formed sphere-like micelles when the temperature was high enough for melting all PPDO crystals. During the cooling run, a hysteresis of phase transition was observed because of the supercooling of crystallization. The morphological evolution of the copolymer micelle suggested that the formation of the star anise-like nano-aggregates was a hierarchical assembly process. A \"crystallization induced hierarchical assembly\" mechanism was therefore proposed to explain the formation of the star anise-like nano-aggregates. Metastable flake-like nano-particles formed at the initial stage of crystallization of PPDO blocks. The hydrophobic core of the flake was composed of several crystal lamellae or plates piled up in a layer-by-layer fashion. With further crystallization of PPDO blocks, the flakes tended to aggregate because of the variation of the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. The active edge of crystalline lamellae in the hydrophobic core of one flake may induce two different growth modes: epitaxial growth with amorphous spherical micelles and interparticle interpenetration crystallization in the amorphous region of other flakes. The branched structure of the nano-particles was therefore formed driven by interparticle interpenetration crystallization and epitaxial crystallization simultaneously. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The temperature of the polymerization ranged from 158 to 198 \u00b0C.

        "abstract": "Abstract Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(butylene adipate-co- terephthalate) (PBAT) were mixed at a ratio of 40:60, extruded to form granules and cast into film; then, the PLA, PBAT, and PBAT/PLA film samples were buried in real soil environments. The residual degraded samples were taken regularly from the soil and analyzed by SEM, DSC, TGA, IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The analyses showed that PBAT and PLA had different biodegradation mechanisms. Further, the melting temperature and the melting point change of the various components in the PBAT/PLA blend before and after the biodegradation essentially followed the process of the changes in the respective single polymers. After biodegradation, the carbon atom content in the molecular structure of the PBAT, PLA, and PBAT/PLA samples decreased, while the oxygen atom content increased, indicating that the samples indeed degraded. The biodegradation rates of PBAT and PLA in the PBAT/PLA blend were not the same as those for the single materials. \u00a9 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In order to overcome the defects of poiy (p -dioxanone) (PPDO) due to its hydrophobicity, amphiphilic PPDO/poly( ethylene glycol) (PEG) multiblock copolymers were synthesized by coupling the dihydroxyl-terminated PPDO with dicarboxylic acid-terminated PEG. The structures and molecular characteristics of the resulting PPDO/ PEG multiblock copolymers were studied by 'H-NMR and GPC. The crystallization and thermal stability of the copolymers were studied using DSC and TGA. DSC analysis showed that the PPDO blocks restrained the crystallization of PEG blocks. TGA showed that the multiblock copolymers underwent thermal degradation in two separate steps for the PPDO and PEG blocks, respectively from which the PPDO contents could be calculated, and the results were very close to the theoretical values . Polymeric nanoparticles were prepared in an aqueous medium by dialysis technique. The more the content of hydrophilic PEG in copo1yme,the easier the formation of nanoparticles. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to investigate the nanoparticles of copolymers, showing a mono-dispersed size distribution and hydrodynamic diameters of around 173 - 193 nm . The novel PPDO/PEG multiblock copolymers may have a potential application in drug delivery systems.",

To improve the compatibility between SPI and PBS, the polyester was pretreated by introducing different amounts of urethane and isocyanate groups before blending. The blends containing pretreated PBS showed much finer phase structures because of good dispersion of polyester in protein. Consequently, the tensile strength and modulus of blends increased obviously. A lower glass transition temperature of protein in the blends than that of the pure SPI, which was caused by the improvement of the compatibility between two phases, was observed by dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA). The hydrophobicity, water resistance, and moisture absorption at different humidities of the blends were modified significantly due to the incorporation of PBS.",

The morphology, thermal behaviors, tensile properties and flame-retardant performances of PC/PHDDT composites were investigated. Results suggested that fine deformation and microfibrillation of PHDDT in PC matrix could be formed during flake extrusion, which was confirmed by both the SEM observation and rheological analysis. With the increase of PHDDT content, the limiting oxygen index (LOI), tensile strength and storage modulus of the composites were enhanced simultaneously, along with the gradually decreased values of the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and the total heat released (THR), indicating the in situ reinforced and flame-retardant PC/PHDDT composites could be obtained.",

Moreover, a new intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system, which was composed of PSPTR and Phenol Formaldehyde Resin (PF), was used to impart flame retardancy for ABS. Flammability properties of ABS/IFR composites were investigated by Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) and vertical burning test (UL-94), respectively. The results showed that when the total addition content was 30 wt%, the weight ratio of PSPTR to PF is 1:1, the LOI value of ABS/IFR reached 28.2, and UL-94 reached V-1 rating. A distinct synergistic flame retardant effect exists between PSPTR and PF. The TGA data showed that the IFR (PSPTR/PF = 1:1, wt%) had three weight-loss stages and had a high residue of 50.21 wt% at 700\u00b0C. The thermal degradation process of PSPTR and char-forming mechanism of IFR was studied by thermogravimetric analysis/infrared spectrometry (TG-IR) detailedly. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Ring-opening polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one in bulk was initiated by three titanium alkoxides, titanium dichlorodiisopropoxide (TiCl 2(OiPr)2), titanium chlorotriisopropoxide (TiCl(OiPr) 3), and titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4). The results indicate that the polymerization rate increased with number of OiPr groups in the initiator. High conversion of monomer (90%) and high molecular weight (11.9 \u00d7 104 g/mol) of resulting polymer can be achieved in only 5 min at 60 \u00b0C with Ti(OiPr)4 as an initiator. Analysis on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra suggests the initiating sites for TiCl2(OiPr)2, TiCl(OiPr)3, and Ti(OiPr) 4 to be 1.9, 2.6, and 3.8, respectively. Coordination-insertion mechanism for the polymerization via cleavage of the acyl-oxygen bonds of the monomer was proved by NMR investigation. Kinetic studies indicate that polymerization initiated by Ti(OiPr)4 followed a first-order kinetics, with an apparent activation energy of 33.7 kJ/mol. It is noteworthy that this value is significantly lower than earlier reported values with other catalysts, namely La(OiPr)3 (50.5 kJ/mol) and Sn(Oct)2 (71.8 kJ/mol), which makes it an attractive catalyst for reactive extrusion polymerization. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Chemical structures and physical properties of PBPDPs were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Thermal stability of the copolyesters was determined via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the liquid crystalline behaviours were observed using polarizing optical microscopy (POM). Results showed that the introduction of PPDBA into the copolyester could decrease the liquid crystalline temperature (Tlc) and the isotropic temperature (Ti) as a result of both copolymerization and the non-coplanar structure of PPDBA; furthermore, when the molar ratio of PPDBA reached 15%, the copolyester turned into a semi-crystalline polymer and lost its liquid crystallinity. Thermal stability of the copolyester increased with increasing the content of PPDBA, due to the positive contribution of the phosphorus-containing structure.

        "abstract": "Starch and poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) are the natural and synthetic biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, respectively. Their copolymers can find extensive applications in biomedical materials. However, it is very difficult to synthesize starch-graft-FPDO copolymers in common organic solvents with very good solubility. In this article, well-defined polysaccharides-graft- poly(p-dioxanone) (SA n-PPDO) copolymers were successfully synthesized via the ring-opening polymerization of p-dioxanone (PDO) with an acetylated starch (SA) initiator and a Sn(Oct) 2 catalyst in bulk. The copolymers were characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 1H NMR, gel permeation chromatography, thermogravimetric analysis (TG), differential scanning calorimetry, and wide angle x-ray diffraction. The in vitro degradation results showed that the introduction of SA segments into the backbone chains of the copolymers led to an enhancement of the degradation rate, and the degradation rate of SA n-PPDO increased with the increase of SA wt %. Microspheres with an average volume diameter of 20 \u03bcm, which will have potential applications in controlled release of drugs, were successfully prepared by using these new copolymers. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Poly (lactic acid) (PLA)/F-ZrP nanocomposites were prepared by melt blending method. The thermal stability and combustion behavior of PLA/F-ZrP nanocomposites were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and cone calorimeter test (CCT). The results showed that the addition of flame retardant F-ZrP slightly affect PLA's thermal stability, but significantly improve the flame retardancy of PLA composites. In comparison with neat PLA, the LOI value of PLA/F-ZrP was increased from 19.0 to 26.5, and the UL-94 rating was enhanced to V-0 as the loading of F-ZrP at 10%. SEM results suggested the introduction of F-ZrP in the PLA system can form compact intumescent char layer during burning. All these results showed that the F-ZrP performed good flame retardancy for PLA. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In present work, biodegradable PLA/starch composites are prepared from PLA and etherified starch (EST) by extrusion and uniaxial orientation processing with a pretreated mixing procedure under a programmed temperature. The products are examined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technique. The results revealed that small amount of PLA molecules have strong interaction with EST which may be ascribed to the esterification between the terminal carboxyl groups of PLA and hydroxyl groups in EST. The morphological properties observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique confirmed that the composites with a pretreatment procedure had much better dispersion and homogeneity of starch in the PLA matrix than the composites without the pretreatment procedure. Consequently, an improvement in mechanical properties has been achieved. Comparing with the samples without the pretreatment procedure, the mechanical performances such as tensile strength, elongation-at-break and modulus of the composites with a pretreatment procedure were significantly improved. This approach is identified as a reasonable method to produce commercial PLA/starch composites with economical feasibility.",

The activation energy was determined by using Kissinger method, Flynn\u2013Wall\u2013Ozawa method and Friedman method. The results for copolyesters with the phosphorus linkage as pendent groups, which were synthesized from the condensation of terephthalic acid (TPA), ethylene glycol(EG) and 9,10-dihydro-10 [2,3-di (hydroxy carbonyl) propyl] 10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DDP), were compared with those of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and copolyesters with phosphorus linkage in the main chain, which were synthesized from TPA, EG and 2-carboxyethyl(phenylphosphinic) acid (CEPP). It is shown that the presence of the bulky pendent phosphorus side group in the copolyester tends to decrease the activation energy for decomposition in air.",

The thermal stability, combustion behavior, char formation, flame retardant mechanism and mechanical properties of the IFR-LGFPP samples were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94 test, cone calorimeter test, scanning electronic microscopy, and mechanical property tests. When the content of IFR is 20\u00a0wt%, the LOI value of IFR-LGFPP reaches 31.3, and the vertical burning test reaches UL-94 V-0 rating, solving the \u201ccandlewick effect\u201d caused by long glass fiber without additional amount of the IFR. All the relevant cone calorimeter parameters also show that IFR-LGFPP has much better flame-retardant behaviors than LGFPP. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of IFR-LGFPP almost remain unchanged in comparison with those of LGFPP containing no IFR. The flame retardant mechanism was also discussed.",

        "abstract": "A catalytic system based on Na 2 WO 4 /CH 3 COOH/H 2 O 2 effectively oxidizes natural rubber (NR) to prepare telechelic epoxidised liquid natural rubber (TELNR). The Na 2 WO 4 /CH 3 COOH/H 2 O 2 catalytic system possesses a much higher epoxidation efficiency than the traditional CH 3 COOH/H 2 O 2 system: the epoxidation degree ( X epoxy ) of products increases from merely 5.6% (CH 3 COOH/H 2 O 2 ) to values as high as 52.1% (Na 2 WO 4 /CH 3 COOH/H 2 O 2 ) by reacting for 24\u00a0h at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Moreover, this catalytic system also induces hydrolytic degradation so that the weight average molecular weight ( M w \u00af ) of NR decreases, e.g., from 14.10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 5 Da (NR) to 0.57\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 5 Da (TELNR) after reacting for 30\u00a0h. The catalytic process probably proceeds via a mononuclear tungsten peroxo-species with coordinated peracetyl/acetyl group, as suggested by ESI-MS measurements. During oxidation, the tungstic anion [W(CH 3 COOO)(O)(O 2 ) 2 ] \u2212 not only catalyzes NR epoxidation, but also induces a further oxidation of epoxy groups to form ketones and aldehydes.",

PES/PPDO blends are completely miscible as proved by the single grass transition temperature (T(g)) dependence of composition and decreasing crystallization temperature of the blends in comparison with the respective component. POM observation suggests that simultaneous crystallization of PES and PPDO components in the blends took place, spherulites of one component can crystallize inside the spherulites of the other component, and the unique interpenetrated crystalline morphology has been formed for the blends in the full composition range. Isothermal crystallization kinetics of the blends was studied by DSC and the data were analyzed by the Avrami equation. The results suggest that the crystallization mechanisms of the blends were unchanged but the overall crystallization rates were slowed down compared with neat PES and neat PPDO. WAXD results indicate that the crystal structures of PES and PPDO did not change in the blends.",

The results show that the contents of flammable small molecular compounds generated during combustion are sharply reduced, which proves that the extensive pyrolysis of PET is retarded by the existence of PDPTP. Moreover, PDPTP does not change the mechanism of pyrolysis of PET. According to the results of fire test using Cone calorimetry, the ignition time of PET is prolonged, the heat release rate and effective heat of combustion of PET decreases drastically, and the amount of char residue increases due to the addition of PDPTP, proving the excellent flame retardancy of PDPTP. Besides, the specific extinction area also decreased after adding PDPTP, suggesting an improved smoke suppressing behavior.",

        "abstract": "Poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), synthesized via microorganisms, has been paid great attention. However, its biodegradation behavior in pilot-scale composting conditions has not been investigated. In this paper, the biodegradability of PHBV containing 3 mol% of hydroxyvalerate (HV) was tested under composting conditions on both a pilot and a laboratory scale. In the pilot-scale composting conditions, parameters such as pH value, temperature and the amounts of oxygen and CO 2 produced were determined periodically. In the laboratory-scale controlled composting, the evolved CO 2 was measured so as to calculate the degree of biodegradation of PHBV. It was found that the biodegradation behavior of PHBV in the pilot-scale composting conditions was similar with that in the laboratory-scale. The PHBV film was completely disintegrated in the pilot-scale composting test, and the degree of biodegradation was 81% in the laboratory-scale control composting test. The variations of molecular weight and morphology of PHBV films during composting were also monitored.",

        "abstract": "In this manuscript, synergistic effect was found when aluminum hydroxymethylphosphinate (AHMP) and melamine pyrophosphate (MPyP) with a suitable mass ratio were used together for glass-fiber-reinforced polyamide 6 composites (GFPA6). Both vertical burning test (UL-94) and limited oxygen index (LOI) results showed that GFPA6 containing 5 wt % AHMP and 25 wt % MPyP had excellent flame retardance, i.e. its LOI value was 31.0 and UL-94 reached V-0 rating even for the sample with 1.6 mm thickness. Besides, the flammable properties and smoke suppression of GFPA6 were also improved demonstrated by cone calorimetry results. The thermal stability and the decomposition activation energies (E\u03b1) were studied by TGA. Moreover, the morphology of char after the LOI test was investigated by SEM. It was found that the interaction existing between PA6, AHMP, and MPyP resulted in the higher char content and stable char layer on the GFPA6 surface, which is helpful in improving the flame retardancy of GFPA6. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

In this work, a new approach was developed by chain extending of dihydroxyl-terminated PPDO prepolymer (HPPDO) using hexam-ethylenediisocyanate (HDI) as the chain extender in order to obtain high molecular weight PPDO in a short time. HPPDO was prepared by ring-opening polymerization of p-dioxanone (PDO) catalyzed by SnOct 2 and initiated by 1, 4-butanediol (BD). The results obtained show that HPPDO prepolymers can react with Hexameth-ylenediisocyanate effectively, and the molecular weights of the resulting chain-extended products increase several decade times in less than one hour compared with the prepolymers. The highest viscosity-average molecular weight of the resulting polymer can reach 257000 g/mol. Both the prepolymer and the chain extended product were characterized by 1H NMR.",

        "abstract": "Novel phosphorus-containing liquid crystalline copolyesters based on biphenyl mesogenic monomer(PDEBP) were synthesized by polycondensation of dimethyl biphenyl-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylate(DBD),diethylene glycol(DEG) and a phosphorus-containing diol,2-(6-oxido-6H-dibenz<c,e><1,2>oxaphosphorin-6-yl)-1,4-phenylenebis(oxy)diethanol(DOPO-HQ-HE).Chemical structure of the PDEBP was characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy,and the thermal and liquid crystalline behaviors of the copolyesters were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis(TGA),differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) and hot-stage polarizing optical microscope(POM).TGA results suggested that char formation of the copolyesters was improved with the introduction of DOPO-HQ-HE without destroying the initial thermal stability of the polymer,and the residue at 700\u2103 in N2(Wt700R) of PDEBP7.5(7.5 mol% of DOPO-HQ-HE in copolyester) reached 31.9 wt%,having a positive influence on flame retardance of the copolyesters.DSC tests suggested that the crystallinity of the copolyesters was destroyed by incorporating DOPO-HQ-HE into the main chain due to the bulky pendent group.The isotropic temperature(Ti) and endothermic heat(\u0394Hi) were decreased by increasing the amount of DOPO-HQ-HE,and the Ti and \u0394Hi of PDEBP7.5 reached 129\u2103and 1.61 J/g,respectively.POM observations showed that a typical birefringence phenomenon of nematic schlieren structure could be found in the processes of both heating and cooling,in accord with the results of DSC tests except these of PDEBP7.5,for which it was hard to find the birefringence phenomenon during heating and cooling by POM,indicating the further introduction of the phosphorus-containing diol could destroy the liquid crystalline behavior of the resulting copolyester.",

        "abstract": "Polyethylene (PE) was treated with various formulations containing an intumescent fire retardant, which consists of melamine phosphate (MP), pentaerythritol (PER) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and one or none of following metal chelates: CuSAO, CoSAO and NiSAO. The behaviour of this intumescent system can be enhanced significantly by the addition of small amounts (0.2%) of metal chelate (CuSAO, CoSAO and NiSAO). The thermal stabilization, burning behaviour and char formation of the fire retardant PE system have been investigated by TGA, LOI, UL-94 test, SEM and cone calorimetry. All formulations studied provide good fire retardant behaviour, with LOI \u2265 27.4 and UL-94 V-0 rating. TGA results present more complicated thermal decomposition behaviour after the addition of small amounts (0.2%) of metal chelate when compared to that of PE-IFR. Cone calorimetry of PE-IFR\u2013metal chelate (PE-IFR\u2013CuSAO, PE-IFR\u2013CoSAO and PE-IFR\u2013NiSAO) shows a very significant decrease in HRR, PHRR, ML, THR and a very significant improvement of TTI compared to samples without metal chelate. Furthermore, SEM and photographs of the char layer show that the char layer from PE-IFR\u2013metal chelate has a compact and tough char structure compared to the open porous char layer produced by sample without metal chelate.

Its chemical structure was characterized by FT-IR and 1 H NMR spectra. FR-GF-PET was prepared by melt-mixing the flame retardant with GF-PET. The effects of the flame retardant on the flammability and thermally decomposing behaviors of GF-PET were studied via LOI, UL-94 and TGA tests. The results showed that despite a negative effect on the thermal stability of GF-PET, the incorporation of the flame retardant improved the flame retardancy of GF-PET largely. The LOI values of GF-PET increase linearly with the increase of flame retardant content. The GF-PET passed the V-0 rating in UL-94 tests when 15 wt% of the flame retardant was added to GF-PET. An interesting phenomenon was found, that is, with the increase of flame retardant content, the flame retardancy of the system increased but the char yield decreased, which was explained according to the evidences of XPS tests and the kinetics of thermally decomposing reaction.",

OZrP was synthesized directly by a solvent thermal method. The morphological characterization of PLA/IFR/OZrP nanocomposites was conducted by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The effect of the OZrP on flame retardancy and the thermal stability of PLA/IFR composites were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94) and cone calorimeter test. The TGA data illustrated that the OZrP could increase the residue and significantly improve the flame retardancy of PLA/IFR/OZrP nanocomposites showing an excellent synergistic effect. The addition of OZrP to the flame-retardant PLA increases the LOI and enhances the UL-94 rating. Cone calorimeter tests gave clear evidence that the incorporation of OZrP into PLA/IFR composites resulted in the significant reduction of the heat release rate (HRR), low total heat release (THR) and high amount of char residues during combustion. The flame-retardant mechanism of PLA/IFR/OZrP nanocomposites may correspond to the intumescent flame-retardant mechanism and catalyzed carbonization mechanism caused by OZrP.",

Surface morphology of PBSEG10K with different PEG content was investigated by atomic force microscope (AFM). Different from di- or triblock copolymers, the microstructure and confinement of PEG dispersed phase in PBS matrix phase highly depends on chain length and sequence as well as segment content. The transition point of the PEG segment content from heterogeneous to homogeneous nucleation mechanism decreased from 50 to 39 wt % with PEG segment chain length increasing from 1000 to 2000 g/mol. When PEG segment chain length increased further to 6000 and 10000 g/mol, homogeneous nucleation phenomenon took place at much lower PEG content and fractional crystallization was observed at 29 and 24 wt %, respectively. Homogeneous nucleation mechanism of PBSEG(1K-36), PBSEG(2K-26), PBSEG(6K-19), and PBSEG(10K-12) was evidenced by the large supercoolings needed for crystallization, as well as first-order crystallization kinetics obtained. Self-nucleation behaviors of PEG segment still rely on the composition of PBSEGs. In the case of heterogeneous nucleation crystallization, self-nucleation behaviors of PEG segment showed standard self-nucleation behavior with classical three self-nucleation domains. When the crystallizable chains were confined into isolated microdomains, however, self-nucleation domain (domain II) disappeared. The absence of III(A) was observed in PBSEG(2K-39), while PBSEG(6K-29) had both III(A) and III(SA). Furthermore, AFM morphology studies still indicated the confined degree of PEG segment by previous PBS crystals was profoundly influenced by segment fraction. The confinement of the PEG segment by previous PBS edge-on lamellae was observed in the sample which displays a homogeneous nucleation crystallization behavior.",

The structures of n-HA and EG-HA synthesized were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to observe the dispersibility and morphology of nanopaticles in the PPDO matrix and the ethanol solution, respectively. The thermal properties were examined with differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetric analyzer. In conclusion, the PPDO/EG-HA composites have better thermal stability and higher overall crystallization rate than both the PPDO/HA composites and the neat PPDO. A nucleating effect of n-HA was observed as the crystallization temperature of PPDO increased.",

        "abstract": "Synergistic flame-retardant effect of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) on an intumescent flame retardant (IFR) in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was investigated by limited oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), cone calorimeter (CC) test, and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The results of LOI and UL-94 tests indicated that the addition of HNTs could dramatically increase the LOI value of LDPE/IFR in the case that the mass ratio of HNTs to IFR was 2/28 at 30 wt % of total flame retardant. Moreover, in this case the prepared samples could pass the V-0 rating in UL-94 tests. CC tests results showed that, for LDPE/IFR, both the heat release rate and the total heat release significantly decreased because of the incorporation of 2 wt % of HNTs. SEM observations directly approved that HNTs could promote the formation of more continuous and compact intumescent char layer in LDPE/IFR. TGA results demonstrated that the residue of LDPE/IFR containing 2 wt % of HNTs was obviously more than that of LDPE/IFR at the same total flame retardant of 30 wt % at 700\ufffd\ufffdC under an air atmosphere, and its maximum decomposing rate was also lower than that of LDPE/IFR, suggesting that HNTs facilitated the charring of LDPE/IFR and its thermal stability at high temperature in this case. Both TGA and SEM results interpreted the mechanism on the synergistic effect of HNTs on IFR in LDPE, which is that the migration of HNTs to the surface during the combustion process led to the formation of a more compact barrier, resulting in the promotion of flame retardancy of LDPE/IFR. In addition, the mechanical properties of LDPE/IFR/HNTs systems were studied, the results showed that the addition of 0.5-2 wt % of HNTs could increase the tensile strength and the elongation at break of LDPE/IFR simultaneously. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Di-block co-polymers of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(L-lactic acid) (PEG-PLLA) were prepared by ring-opening polymerization, and their self-association and micelle formation were investigated. The block co-polymers have the same block length of the hydrophilic PEG segment (Mn = 2000), but different chain lengths of the hydrophobic PLLA segment (Mn = 700, 1000 and 1300, respectively). The di-block co-polymers synthesized were characterized by GPC, 1H-NMR, TGA and DSC. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the PEG-PLLA micelles was determined at various temperatures (5-45 degrees C) using a dye absorption technique involving fluorescence spectrophotometry with pyrene as a probe to monitor the change in the polarity of the microenvironment in the micelle. An increase in the molecular weight of the hydrophobic block decreases the CMC. The partition coefficients of pyrene between the micellar and aqueous phases range from 0.68 x 10(4 )to 1.76 x 10(4), depending on the PLLA content in the block co-polymers. An Arrhenius plot of ln(CMC) versus 1/T exhibited an almost constant CMC at low temperatures (<35 degrees C), followed by an increase of the CMC at higher temperatures (>35 degrees C). The increase of the CMC with temperature indicates the increase of the mobility of the hydrophobic PLLA core. These results were confirmed by 1H-NMR measurements. The micelle size and size distribution were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), and were in the range of 78-92 nm. A spherical micelle shape was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. These results indicate that the CMC and the thermal characteristics of the core-forming segment of the block co-polymer play an important role in the properties of the polymer micelles used for drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "The aluminum phenylphosphinate (BPA-Al) was synthesized and its chemical structure was confirmed by FT-IR, 1H NMR, and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). BPA-Al was used to prepare a series of flame-retardant glass-fiber-reinforced polyamide 6 (GFPA6) composites together with melamine pyrophosphate (MPyP) and sodium tungstate (ST) via melt compounding. The flame retardancy of the composites was investigated by vertical burning test and cone calorimeter test. The thermal behaviors and decomposition kinetics were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). BPA-Al alone could not improve the flame retardancy of GFPA6 composites, but the combination of BPA-Al and MPyP resulted in a UL-94 V-2 rating, and the addition of a small amount of ST to the flame retardant system could endow the composites a V-0 rating. The flame retardant systems also resulted in a decrease in PHRR and THR in cone calorimeter test. The analysis of thermal decomposition kinetics showed that the activation energies (E\u03b1) of the flame-retardant composites dramatically decreased compared with that of GFPA6. \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "As poly( p -dioxanone) (PPDO) with a high molecular weight (viscosity-average molecular weight ( M \u03bd ) > 100,000 g/mol) is not easy to be obtained in a short time, a new approach has been developed to produce high molecular weight poly( p -dioxanone) (HPPDO-T) by chain-extending reaction of hydroxyl-terminated PPDO (HPPDO) prepolymers using toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) as chain extender. Here HPPDO prepolymers were synthesized via ring-opening polymerization of p -dioxanone (PDO) monomer initiated by 1,4-butanediol (BD) with Stannous octoate (SnOct 2 ) as catalyst. The resulting polymers, having a highest M \u03bd of 250,000 g/mol, were characterized by 1 H NMR, TG, DSC and WXRD. HPPDO prepolymers can react with TDI more effectively than the PPDO prepolymers initiated by mono-functional initiators, and the molecular weights of resulting chain-extended products increase several decade times in an hour comparing to the prepolymers. The chain extended products HPPDO-T have better thermal stability, and higher glass transition temperatures and lower crystallization rates than PPDO homopolymer. Keywords Poly( p -dioxanone) Hydroxyl-terminated Chain extending Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate 1 Introduction Recently, poly( p -dioxanone) (PPDO) has attracted many attentions because of its excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, and it is considered as a candidate not only for medical uses but also for universal uses, such as films, molded products, laminates, foams, non-woven material, adhesives and coatings [1\u20133] . However, PPDO had not become a focus of aliphatic polyesters for quite a long time due to the high cost and the low activity of the monomer, p -dioxanone (PDO) [4] . In general, PPDO can be synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of PDO with effective catalysts, but it is not an easy work to obtain high molecular weight PPDO in a short time because the reaction condition is very critical, for example, high purity of monomer and high activity of catalysts, etc. [4] In fact, the molecular weight of aliphatic polyesters is an important factor that determines their properties [5] , therefore, many approaches have been employed to enhance the molecular weight of aliphatic polyesters [6,7] . Chain extension has been considered as an effective and convenient method, which has been used frequently in synthesis of polyurethanes [8\u201311] and biodegradable polymers. Tuominen and co-workers obtained high molecular weight poly(lactic acid) by chain extending with 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate and 2,2\u2032-bis(2-oxazoline) [12] . Zhong et al. [13] treated low molecular weight poly(lactic acid) by chain extending with methylenediphenyl diisocyanate. Typical chain extenders for polyesters, which contain \u2013OH and \u2013COOH groups, include diisocyanates, diepoxides, bisoxazolines, dianhydrides and bisketeneacetals [12] . Diisocyanates are the most important chain extenders for polymers containing hydroxyl group [14] , although the possible toxicity of its degradation products after hydrolysis or biological decomposition is still an important factor which must be considered [15] . It can connect two chains together through urethane bonds to form a longer chain [16] . Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) has been chosen as chain extender for PPDO in our previous work [17,18] as it is easy to get. A PPDO homopolymer chain contains one terminal hydroxyl group and one terminal carboxyl group when it is prepared by ring-opening polymerization of PDO initiated by traces of water and catalyzed by SnOct 2 . Each isocyanate group can react with one terminal hydroxyl group of PPDO prepolymers, resulting in chain-extension. The decarboxylation may take place between the isocyanate group and terminal carboxyl group when the reaction temperature is higher than 180 \u00b0C, at which, however, the thermal degradation may appear, resulting in an obvious decrease in the molecular weight of PPDO. Therefore the molecular weight of chain extended products was limitedly increased for PPDO prepolymer containing only one hydroxyl end group [17] . To prepare high molecular weight PPDO, in the present paper, 1,4-butanediol (BD) as the dihydroxyl compound was employed to produce hydroxyl-terminated PPDO (HPPDO) prepolymers for the first time, and TDI was used as chain extender to synthesize high molecular weight PPDO (HPPDO-T) in a short time. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials p -Dioxanone (PDO), provided by the Pilot Plant of the Center for Degradable and Flame-Retardant Polymeric Materials (Chengdu, China), was dried over CaH 2 , and distilled under reduced pressure. Stannous octoate (SnOct 2 ) (\u2a7e95%) from Sigma (USA) was used as received. 1,4-Butanediol (BD) was purchased from Zhiyuan Chemical Company (Tianjin, China) and was used after drying. TDI and other reagents were purchased from Sitong Chemical Company (Chengdu, China) and used without further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of HPPDO prepolymer Ring-opening polymerization of PDO was performed through bulk polymerization with magnetic stirring in a flame-dried glass reactor. The reactor was evacuated and purged with argon several times prior to addition of PDO and BD with a syringe, and the reactor was immersed into an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C with stirring for 10 min. Then SnOct 2 /toluene solution was injected into the reactor to perform the reaction for a predetermined time. After reaction, the reactor was rapidly cooled to room temperature and the HPPDO product was shattered with crushing machine. 2.3 Chain extending of HPPDO prepolymer HPPDO prepolymers were added in a dried glass reactor. The reactor was evacuated and purged with argon several times before it was immersed into a temperature-adjusted silicone oil bath. When the prepolymers were melted completely, TDI was injected while stirring for predetermined intervals. The chain extending reaction proceeded for a predetermined time with a continuous argon stream feed under the surface of the melt. After reaction, the reactor was rapidly cooled to room temperature. 2.4 Characterization The number-average molecular weight (M n ) and molecular weight distribution (MWD, M w / M n ) of HPPDO were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Waters GPC-Wyatt Interferometric Refractometer) at 25 \u00b0C. Chloroform was used as solvent and eluent with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and polystyrene as standards. As the conventional solvents such as chloroform and tetrahydrofuran used in GPC measurements cannot resolve PPDO with high molecular weights, only the intrinsic viscosity [ \u03b7 ] of the resulting polymers were measured in phenol/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (1:1 v/v) solution using an Ubbelohde viscometer maintained at 25 \u00b0C. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 with 400 MHz NMR spectrometer (INOVA Varian). Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) patterns were recorded with an X-ray diffractometer (Philips X\u2019Pert) with Cu Ka radiation. DSC measurement was performed with TA Q100 (TA instruments, USA) in sealed aluminum pan under nitrogen atmosphere. The samples were cooled to \u221250 \u00b0C from room temperature, and then heated to 140 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min, kept for 5 min to eliminate the thermal history, then cooled to \u221250 \u00b0C at a cooling rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. The samples were again heated up to 140 \u00b0C at the same rate. The glass transition temperature ( T g ), the crystallization temperature ( T c ) and the melting temperature ( T m ) were obtained from the thermogram. TG measurements were conducted with TA Q400 (TA instruments, USA) system in platinum pans at prescribed heating rates of 10 \u00b0C/min in a range of ambient temperature to 450 \u00b0C under a steady flow of nitrogen (50 mL/min). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis of hydroxyl-terminated PPDO (HPPDO) Usually, PPDO homopolymer has a terminal hydroxyl group and a terminal carboxyl group in each polymer chain, which was synthesized via ring opening polymerization of PDO using SnOct 2 as catalyst and traces of water as initiator. Therefore, the efficiency of the chain extension of PPDO prepared by this method is very low while the diisocyanate is used as chain extender, for it is an attractive class of chain extender for hydroxyl-terminated polyesters. Theoretically, the molecular weight of chain extending products can only increase to being twice as big as that of the prepolymer. However, the efficiency of chain extension will increase significantly if all prepolymer chains have two terminal hydroxyl groups. When the number of isocyanate groups is just equal to that of hydroxyl groups in the system, all the prepolymers should be extended into one single molecular chain in an ideal state. However, the result is far from the ideal state since the reaction activity decreased with the increase of the molecular weight of chain extended products. Nevertheless, it is still a wise choice for getting high molecular weight products by this method. To introduce hydroxyl group to both ends of PPDO chain, 1,4-butanediol was selected as initiator in the synthesis of prepolymer. Scheme 1 schematizes the reaction pathway. HPPDO prepolymers with different molecular weights were synthesized via ring-opening polymerization of PDO monomer initiated by 1,4-butanediol with SnOct 2 as catalyst. The polymerization was performed in bulk and the data on the synthesized prepolymers are presented in Table 1 . It is well known that the number average degree of polymerization increases with monomer/initiator (M/I) ratio in the ring opening polymerization of lactone initiated by SnOct 2 [19] . In this work, different PDO/BD molar ratios were selected to obtain prepolymers with different molecular weights, and they are an important factor that influenced the process of chain extending reaction and the structure of the chain extended products. For the purpose of characterizing the structure of prepolymers clearly, 1 H NMR spectrum of HPPDO sample produced with a PDO/BD molar ratio of 10 (HPPDO 10 ) was recorded ( Fig. 1 ). The HPPDO sample was extracted with acetone to eliminate unreacted monomers before the 1 H NMR test. Resonances located at 4.35 ( \u03b4 H e ), 4.18 ( \u03b4 H c ), 3.74\u20133.79 ( \u03b4 H d ) ppm were assigned to the three methylene hydrogen atoms of PPDO, respectively. Beside those signals, the signals occurring at 4.12 ( \u03b4 H b ) and 1.71 ( \u03b4 H a ) ppm were assigned to the methylene protons of BD. Furthermore, the integral ratio of those two signals ( \u03b4 H b and \u03b4 H a ) is about 1:1, supporting that BD was incorporated in the polymer backbone with two hydroxyl groups formed in the polymer tails and the two hydroxyl groups of BD have equal reactivity towards monomers. In addition, as seen in Table 1 , the intrinsic viscosity of HPPDO increased with the feed molar ratio of PDO to BD, suggesting once again that BD is the real initiator and the molecular weight of HPPDO can be controlled by the adjustment of PDO/BD ratio. 3.2 Chain extending of HPPDO with TDI Chain extending take place by the reaction between the terminated hydroxyl group of HPPDO and NCO group of TDI. The reaction process is shown in Scheme 2 . In chain extending reaction, four kinds of the prepolymers with different OH content and varying molecular weight were used. All the samples were prepared at 150 \u00b0C for 60 min. As we just mentioned, the ratio of isocyanate groups to hydroxyl groups (NCO/OH) should be 1:1 to obtain the optimum chain extension efficiency and high molecular weight products. To identify this rule, the reactions were conducted with various NCO/OH ratios, hereinto; the OH content in prepolymers was calculated from the feed ratio of PDO/BD. The reaction conditions and intrinsic viscosities of chain-extended HPPDO are summarized in Table 2 . To reveal the high efficiency of this approach in enhancing the molecular weight more directly, viscosity-average molecular weights ( M \u03bd ) of HPPDO-T were calculated from the intrinsic viscosity [ \u03b7 ] according to Mark\u2013Houwink equation [ \u03b7 ] = KM \u03bd \u03b1 of PPDO homopolymer, where \u03b1 = 0.63 and K = 7.9 \u00d7 10 \u22124 cm 3 g \u22121 [20] . Although the data calculated from this equation were not well proper to the real value due to the existence of the heterogeneous segments derived from the initiator and chain-extender, it was still a good way to exhibit the relative magnitude of M \u03bd of HPPDO-T. When NCO/OH ratio was lower than 1:1, M \u03bd of HPPDO-T increased rapidly with the increase of NCO/OH ratio and reached the maximum when NCO/OH ratio was around 1:1. After that, the M \u03bd fell off sharply with the further increase of NCO/OH ratio due to the excess of TDI that acted as a terminal agent. No gelling or cross-linking phenomenon has been observed in the present work. It was shown that the chain extending reaction performed following this new approach had good controllability and predictability. From these data, we also found that the original molecular weight of prepolymer ( M \u03bd0 ) played an important role during the chain extending reaction. In the same condition, the lower the M \u03bd0 of prepolymer, the higher the chain extending efficiency that could be achieved. In the case of HPPDO 10 with very low M \u03bd0 , a dramatic enhancement of molecular weight had been obtained, for example, the molecular weight of HPPDO 10 increased 42 times after chain extending under the optimal feed ratio. However, due to the lower M \u03bd0 of HPPDO 10 , M \u03bd of chain extended product was just up to 66,600 g/mol. With the increase of M \u03bd0 of prepolymer, the chain extending reaction became more and more difficult, the best M \u03bd / M \u03bd0 ratio gained for HPPDO 100 was only 10. Two main reasons for this phenomenon are as follows: one is that the increment of melt viscosity in the reaction system reduced the activity of molecular chains, and the other is that the content of hydroxyl chain ends of prepolymers also decreased. Obviously, there exists an optimal M \u03bd0 value of prepolymer for producing high molecular weight chain extending product. In this present research, we found that the chain extending product with the highest molecular weight (250,000 g/mol) was derived from HPPDO 50 with M \u03bd0 of 15,800 g/mol. The 1 H NMR spectrum of chain extended product HPPDO 10 -T4 is shown in Fig. 2 . Obviously, we can still see the signals of methylene groups of HPPDO at 4.35 ( \u03b4 H e ), 4.18 ( \u03b4 H c ), 3.79 ( \u03b4 H d ), 4.12 ( \u03b4 H b ) and 1.71 ( \u03b4 H a ) ppm. The single peak at 2.20 ppm ( \u03b4 H f ) can be attributed to the hydrogen atoms in methyl of TDI, and the very weak single peaks at 6.70, 7.06 and 7.43 ppm ( \u03b4 H g ) are assigned to the hydrogen atoms in phenyl of TDI. Furthermore, the weak single peak at 7.80 ppm ( \u03b4 H h ) is ascribed to the newly formed amide NH groups. According to Scheme 2 , the chain extended products have nine different protons, which all had been found in Fig. 2 . It is suggested that the chain extending reaction performed just follow what we expected. 3.3 Thermal stability of HPPDO-T The weight loss curves obtained at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under steady flow of nitrogen for chain extended products with different intrinsic viscosity and PPDO homopolymer are presented in Fig. 3 , and the relevant data are listed in Table 3 . Clearly, the chain structure and molecular weight of polymers do have effect on their thermal stability. As mentioned previously, different PDO/BD feed ratio would make prepolymers have different intrinsic viscosities. However, for comparison, we used the products (HPPDO-T) with similar intrinsic viscosity (or molecular weight) and with different content of TDI reacted to HPPDO-T polymer chains to conduct TG testing. From Fig. 3 , we can see that all the HPPDO-T polymers have better thermal stability than PPDO homopolymer. The temperatures of onset decomposition ( T 5% ) have been enhanced even if the intrinsic viscosity of HPPDO-T is much lower than that of PPDO homopolymer, and they increase with increasing the molecular weight. Furthermore, the HPPDO-T derived from low molecular weight prepolymer has better thermal stability because its polymer chains contain more aromatic groups derived from TDI. Since the thermal decomposition of PPDO is attributed mainly to the unzipping depolymerization and generating PDO monomers [21] , the presence of aromatic groups in polymer chains may obviously depress this reaction and therefore enhance the thermal stability of chain extended products. As we have noticed, the PPDO homopolymer and all the other chain extended products except HPPDO 10 -T4 have only one weight loss stage. The second weight loss stage of HPPDO 10 -T4 can be attributed to the decomposition of N , N \u2032-(4-methyl- m -phenylene)bis-amide groups reserved in polymer chains after the reaction of HPPDO and TDI because the weight loss percentage (18.5%) at the second stage is quite close to the weight percentage of TDI (15.9%) in the reaction system as feed. And the content of those groups in the other three samples are not enough to be observed. 3.4 Thermal properties and crystallization of HPPDO-T As more aromatic groups have been introduced to the polymer chains, HPPDO-T polymers have a crystallization behavior different from PPDO homopolymer. During the synthetic process, for example, HPPDO 10 -T4 was elastomer when it was cooled to room temperature from melt after synthesis, and it needed about one week to finish the crystallization process. To have a qualitative description, DSC was employed to explore the crystallization behavior of HPPDO-T polymers. Four HPPDO-T samples derived from different prepolymers were chosen for testing, and the DSC curves were illustrated in Fig. 4 . The relevant detailed data are summarized in Table 4 . The first heating scan from \u221250 \u00b0C to 140 \u00b0C for all the chain extended products are shown in Fig. 4 a. Melting peaks have been observed for all of the samples. However, no crystallization peak can be detected during the cooling scanning ( Fig. 4 b) for all the samples at this scanning rate. When it comes to the second heating scan ( Fig. 4 c), HPPDO 20 -T4 still has no crystallization peak, but the crystallization peaks for the other three samples have been detected. The results corresponded with what we observed in synthetic process quite well. HPPDO 20 -T4 has the lowest crystallization rate just like what we mentioned above. It is easy to understand that the introduction of aromatic groups into HPPDO by using TDI as chain extender destroys the regularity and flexibility of polymer chains, which all contribute to the decrease of crystallization rate. Furthermore, these factors also cause the incompletion of grown crystals which behave as the decrease of melting temperature ( Table 4 ). However, the introduction of aromatic groups into HPPDO dose not influence the crystallinity of products obviously if it has enough time to consummate the crystallization process, and the crystallinity of all samples were about 40%, which was obtained from the first heating scan curves (the heat of fusion \u0394 H m 0 for 100% crystalline PPDO was determined as 141 J/g [22] ). From Table 4 , we can see that the glass transition temperature ( T g ) of HPPDO has been raised after chain extending. These phenomena might be caused by two main reasons. First, rigid aromatic structures were introduced into HPPDO polymer chains after chain extending, which reduced the chain movement so as to enhance the rigidity of the chains. The more rigid structure the chains hold, the higher T g the products have. Second, after chain extending, many short chains were connected with rigid TDI, which led to the numbers of flexible free chain ends to decrease and thus to reduce the free volumes. The WXRD curves of PPDO homopolymers and HPPDO 10 -T4 are shown in Fig. 5 . We can see clearly that chain extended product has the same peaks at 2 \u03b8 of about 22\u00b0, 24\u00b0, 29\u00b0 as PPDO homopolymer does [23,24] , which can attributed to the reflection of (2 1 0), (0 2 0) and (3 1 0), respectively, suggesting that the crystal cell dimensions of HPPDO-T are similar to that of PPDO homopolymer and has not been disturbed by the aromatic groups. 4 Conclusions A new approach has been developed successfully not only to produce high molecular weight PPDO but also to improve the properties of PPDO. TDI has been utilized as chain extender to enhance the molecular weight significantly by reacting with the hydroxyl-terminated HPPDO. On the other hand, the aromatic groups of TDI have been introduced into HPPDO chain which may improve the properties of HPPDO-T such as thermal stability. High molecular weight HPPDO-T can be prepared in two steps. Step one is to synthesize a series of HPPDO prepolymers with different intrinsic viscosities via the ring opening polymerization of PDO initiated by BD in the existence of SnOct 2 as catalyst. Step two is to introduce TDI into prepolymer system to enhance the molecular weight by chain extending further. The results show that this approach is very effective and controllable. The molecular weight of HPPDO 10 -T4 has increased 42 times comparing with its prepolymer, HPPDO 10 , only in one hour. The chain extended product with a highest molecular weight of 250,000 g/mol was produced from HPPDO 50 with M \u03bd0 of 15,800 g/mol. The introduction of TDI into this system not only enhanced the molecular weight of HPPDO greatly in a short time, but also influenced the thermal properties and crystallization behaviors of chain extended products. With a similar intrinsic viscosity, the chain extended products, HPPDO-T polymers have higher T g and thermal stability than PPDO homopolymer. Comparing to that of PPDO homopolymer, HPPDO-T polymers have a low crystallization rate, but their crystal cell dimensions have no obvious change.

        "abstract": "Synthesis of polypropylene/organo-layered double hydroxide (PP/OLDH) has been carried out based on self-assembled organocobalt-aluminum LDH (O-CoAl-LDH). The novel method of synthesizing self-assembled CoAl-LDH and its characterization have also been reported in details. This method is proven to be very efficient way of producing OLDH in a single step with homogeneous composition and structure. As flame-retardant nanofiller, O-CoAl-LDH shows significant decrease in heat release rate (HRR), the total heat release (THR) and the heat release capacity (HRC) of the PP composites, though the thermal stability of the compounds decreases slightly compared to the base polymer. Morphological analyses show that the LDH particles are dispersed in PP matrix in a partially exfoliated form. The activation energy calculation based on the Kissinger method reveals that O-CoAl-LDH has a positive effect on the activation energy of thermal decomposition of PP. However, in the presence of this filler, decomposition of the composites starts at an earlier stage than that of pure PP.",

The flame retardancy and thermal behavior of a new intumescent flame-retardant (IFR) system for EVA, which was made of MOPO and ammonium polyphosphate (APP), were investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI) test, vertical burning test (UL-94), cone calorimeter, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). An LOI value of 28.4 and UL-94 V-0 rating can be achieved when the total loading of MOPO and APP was 30 wt.%. The results from cone calorimeter indicate that both the heat release rate (HRR) and the total heat release (THR) of IFR-EVA decreased significantly compared with those of neat EVA. TG curves showed that the amount of residues increased significantly when intumescent additives were added; it also could be found that the LOI values increased with the increase in char residues. Meanwhile, morphology of the residues obtained from burning IFR-EVA in LOI test was studied through the SEM observations and rich compact char layers could explain the excellent flame retardance.",

Lactic acid (LA) was used to modify the TiO 2 surface by the Ti-carboxylic coordination bonds, and LA can chemically bond TiO 2 nanoparticles to form functionalized oligomeric-poly(lactic acid)-grafted TiO 2 nanoparticles (g-TiO 2 ). The resulting g-TiO 2 was added to the poly(lactic acid) (PLA) matrix to prepare PLA/TiO 2 nanocomposites via melting processing. The structure and properties of the nanocomposites were subsequently investigated via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, polar optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic rheometer and universal testing machine. The results showed that g-TiO 2 nanocomposites had a much lower degree of agglomeration than bare TiO 2 . The introduction of g-TiO 2 into PLA matrix improved the crystallinity of the composites. The functionalized nanoparticles played an important role in improving mechanical properties and reducing the complex viscosity of the nanocomposites due to its unique structure and the reasonable interfacial interaction between the nanoparticles and PLA matrix.",

Second, the resulting solution was mixed with sodium montmorillonite. Third, a cellulose/montmorillonite aerogel with a three-dimensional porous structure was prepared via a sol-gel process, solvent exchange and freeze-drying. The viscoelastic analysis results showed that the addition of montmorillonite accelerated the sol-gel process in the cellulose solution. During this process, montmorillonite adhered to the cellulose substrate surface via hydrogen bonding and then became embedded in the pore structure of the cellulose aerogel. As a result, the pore diameter of the aerogel decreased and the specific surface area of the aerogel increased. Furthermore, the addition of montmorillonite increased the compressive modulus and density of the cellulose aerogel and reduced volume shrinkage during the preparation process. In addition, the oil/water adsorption capacities of cellulose aerogels and cellulose/montmorillon aerogels were investigated.",

It was found that nimodipine was released from the micelles for periods as long as 100 h without a burst release occurring. In addition, the MTT assay showed that the CS-g-PPDO copolymers exhibited low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility with L929 cells, highlighting the potential of these copolymers as drug-delivery carriers. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.",

TG-DSC simultaneous thermal analysis, FTIR, dissolution tests and rheological investigations proved the thermal cross-linking behavior of the copolyester, which was not active at the temperature of polymerization and processing but could cross-link rapidly at higher temperature before burning. LOI tests, cone calorimetry and small-scale flame tests further confirmed the self-extinguishment and inhibition for melt-dripping could be achieved through the cross-linking during burning, despite the absence of any flame-retardant element (say, bromine, chlorine, phosphorus, or nitrogen, etc.). Rheological analyses and the SEM microphotographs of the char showed P(ET-co-P)s exhibited a greater complex viscosity through the cross-linking at high temperature, leading to compact char residue, flame-retardant and anti-dripping effects. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "In this paper thermodynamics and kinetics of bulk ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of 1,4-dioxan-2-one (PDO) catalyzed by Novozym 435 were investigated. Results showed that the polymerization reached equilibrium after 12 h at 60\u00b0C in the presence of 5 wt% Novozym 435 (based on PDO). The calculated thermodynamic parameters, enthalpy and standard entropy of the polymerization, are -19 kJ mol-1 and -66 J K-1mol -1, respectively. The kinetic plot of ln{([M]0. [M] e)/([M]t - [M]e)} vs time is linear, indicating that the polymerization is first order with respect to the monomer concentration. The calculated apparent activation energy (Eapp) is 45.3 kJ mol-1, which is lower than that using Sn(Oct)2 and La(OiPr)3 as catalysts. According to 1H NMR and GPC analysis, the ROP of PDO with Novozym 435 catalyzed follows monomer activated mechanism. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "At present, the arguments of the influences of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) on human being and animal's health and their living environment, especially the dioxins issues, have become more and more extensive and drastic all around the world. The Directive on \u201cRestriction of Hazardous Substances\u201d (RoHS) in Europe Union has definitely stipulated to forbid manufacturing some BFRs. The distributions of BFRs in the abiological systems (such as the air and natural sediments) and in the tissues of the biological systems (such as the animals and human beings) were reviewed in this paper. The results showed that the tendency of the concentration of BFRs in the environment and the tissues of the human beings and animals has increased currently. Some BFRs can be enriched in the organism and have potentially magnified. Finally, some view and suggestions about the developmental direction of BFRs in our country were put forward.",

The ring-opening graft copolymerization of SPI-g-PPDO was carried out with stannous octoate as a co-initiator/catalyst in the presence of azeotropic solvent at 80\u00b0C. The molecular structure of SPI-g-PPDO was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results suggested that the content and length of PPDO graft chains of the copolymer increased with the increase of monomer (1,4-dioxan-2-one, PDO) content. Moreover, the results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the copolymer has a definite glass transition temperature and melting point, meaning that the copolymer can be melt-processed. In addition, the copolymers could form crystals after the grafting polymerization. The crystallization ability increases with the increase of graft chain length. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A flame-retardant epoxy resin (EP) was synthesized based on a novel reactive phosphorus-containing monomer, 4-[(5,5-dimethyl-2-oxide-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinan-4-yl)oxy]-phenol (DODPP), and its structures were characterized by FTIR, 1 H NMR and 31 P NMR spectra. The DODPP\u2013EP 3 /LWPA (low molecular weight polyamide), which contains 2.5% phosphorus, can reach UL-94 V-0 rating and a limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of 30.2%. The thermal properties and burning behaviours of cured epoxy resins were investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermogravimetry (TG), LOI, UL-94 tests and cone calorimetry. The morphologies of residues of cured epoxy resins were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). DSC shows that the glass-transition temperatures of cured epoxy resins decrease with increasing phosphorus content. TGA shows that the onset decomposition temperatures and the maximum-rate decomposition temperatures decrease, while char yields increase, with the increase of phosphorus content. The data from the cone calorimeter tests give the evidence that heat release rate (HRR), peak heat release rate (PHRR), average heat release rate (Av-HRR), average mass loss rate (Av-MLR) and the fire growth rate index (FIGRA) decrease significantly for DODPP\u2013EP 3 /LWPA. SEM shows that the DODPP\u2013EP 3 /LWPA forms lacunaris and compact charred layers which inhibit the transmission of heat during combustion.",

In the first step, PPDO diol prepolymers with different molecular weights were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of p-dioxanone; in the second step, PPDO-PU/OMMT nanocomposites were prepared by coupling PPDO diol melt swollen with organo-modified MMT (OMMT), using 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as the chain-extender. The intercalated-exfoliated coexistence morphology of nanocomposites was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermogravimetric analysis (TG), high-pressure capillary rheometer, and mechanical test were performed to investigate the properties of the nanocomposites. The results showed that the thermal stability and mechanical performance of nanocomposites were greatly improved compared to that of pure PPDO. The enhancement of shear viscosity and low temperature sensitivity of the nanocomposite melts enabled it to produce thin films by blowing process successfully.

These materials exhibit mechanical properties similar to those of rigid PU foams or balsa; the compressive modulus (1-97 MPa) and density (0.047-0.174 g/cm3) increase with increasing solids content, with an associated change from a layered to network microstructure structure. Calcium ions, either added directly or indirectly via CaCO3/gluconolactone (GDL) are an effective crosslinking agent for alginate, with the GDL route providing the greatest enhancement of mechanical properties. The thermal stability of the aerogels is also enhanced by the presence of crosslinking. The alginate/clay aerogels possess inherently low flammability, as measured by cone calorimetry, with heat release values decreasing as the proportion of clay in the composites is increased. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we synthesized poly(trimethylene terephthalate)-co-poly(trimethylene sebacate) copolyesters (PTT-co-PTS) by melting copolycondensation and studied the influence of PTS segments on the crystallization and ring-banded morphology of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) spherulites by using a moderate etching technology. It is found that he band spacing of PTT-co-PTS spherulites decreased sharply with PTS segments content. It is confirmed by experiments that there are twofold reasons for the sharp decrease of band spacing in PTT-co-PTS ring-banded spherulites. First, PTS segments acted as diluents for PTT molecules, which intensified the unbalanced surface stress at the fold surfaces for the PTT lamellar twisting. Second, incorporation of PTS segments decreased the thickness of PTT lamellae, and the greater the PTS content, the thinner the lamellae. Both these two changes significantly enhance the helical twisting power of twist PTT lamellae. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A halogen-free phosphorus-containing triol named phosphoryltrimethanol (PTMA) was synthesized and used as a cross-linking agent and a reactive-type flame retardant to prepare inherently flame-retardant flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF). Incorporation of a low content (7.8 wt %) of PTMA into the polyurethane chains can increase the flame retardance of FPUF because of good char formation. The residual chars and evolved gases of PTMA-cross-linked FPUFs were analyzed by SEM, FTIR spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with FTIR spectroscopy. The results indicated that more than 60% of the phosphorus in PTMA-cross-linked FPUF was decomposed into polyphosphoric acid or its derivatives and retained in the char residue. This shows that PTMA mainly played a role in the condensed phase of flame-retardant FPUF. Based on the results, a possible thermal degradation mechanism of PTMA-cross-linked FPUF is proposed. ? 2013 American Chemical Society.",

Thermal degradation and flame retardance of the PS/IFR composites were studied. The results of LOI and UL-94 test showed that when the content of APP and CA was 22.5 and 7.5 wt%, respectively, the LOI value of PS/IFR composite was 32.5%, and a V-0 classification could be achieved. The TGA data indicated that there was a synergistic effect between CA and APP. The cone calorimeter data showed that the heat release rate (HRR), the total heat release (THR) and the mass loss rate (MLR) were reduced largely with the addition of IFR. Some cone calorimeter data, such as smoke production rate (SPR), total smoke production (TSP) and carbon monoxide production (COP), revealed that the IFR could greatly suppress the generation of the smoke during the material flaming. The study on the flame-retardant mechanism of IFR indicated that a steady structure containing P-O-C was formed due to the reaction between APP and CA. The mechanical properties of PS and PS/APP/CA 3:1 were also investigated, and the results showed that, compared to those of the neat PS, the tensile strength and the flexural strength of the PS/IFR composite decreased to a certain extent. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The influences of the content of oligo-poly (lactic acid) graft chains and content of PVA-0588 on the rheological properties of PVA-g-LA copolymers were researched. The rheological parameters including non-Newtonian index and the viscous flow activation energy were analyzed and evaluated. As predicted, the PVA-g-LA samples exhibited noticeable shear thinning behavior. The apparent viscosity, the viscous flow activation energy, and the non-Newtonian index of PVA-g-LA showed obvious correlation with the PLA grafting chain content and PVA-0588 content at a constant temperature and shear rate.

The isothermal crystallization kinetics results show that the overall crystallization rate and the equilibrium melting point of PBS increase with the increasing PBS fraction and the segment chain length (L PBS); on the other hand, the higher content or longer PEG segment within PBSEGs possesses larger crystallization rate of PEG chains. The nucleation mechanisms are demonstrated to be instantaneous 3D and 2D aggregates for PBS and PEG segments within PBSEGs, respectively (except for PBSEG 2K-50, 2D and 3D aggregates for PBS and PEG segments, respectively). POM observations indicate that the PBS within PBSEG multiblock copolymers presents banded spherulites in the investigated temperature range. After quenched to lower temperature, PBS templates the morphology for PEG crystallization, and PEG crystallization just changes the magnitude of birefringence (lighting the spherulites) but not influences the superstructure. Finally, WAXD measurements determine that the crystal structure is not changed with the compositions. \u00a9 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

PNOH was used together with ammonium polyphosphate (APP) to prepare a novel intumescent flame retardant (IFR) for polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). When a few amounts (0.5%) of metal chelates were added, the flame retardancy of the IFR\u2013PVA systems was significantly improved, having a high LOI value of 34.2 in a total IFR loading of 15 wt.%. In order to have an understanding of the resulting flame retardant effects, the thermal degradation behaviors of IFR\u2013PVA systems were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the morphology and structures of residues generated in different conditions were investigated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and FTIR spectra. The results show that NiSAO can promote the thermal stability of the IFR\u2013PVA; the residual char containing polyphosphoric or phosphoric acid is formed during the combustion; the formation of a continuous and dense char layer could inhibit the transmission of heat during contacting with flame and shows good flame retardancy.",

        "abstract": "Catalytic copyrolysis of waste tires over ZSM-5 zeolite with lubricant base oil (LBO) was undertaken at 430 \u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere in a batch mode, and the pyrolysis oils were characterized using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC\u2013MS). By combining with LBO, the ZSM-5 catalyzed pyrolysis system of tires has a sharply enhanced degradation rate. Compared to the pyrolysis without LBO, the liquid yield is increased from 33.6% to 48.0%, while the gas and the residue yields are decreased. In the pyrolysis oils, the content of heavy components is decreased and the content of light oils ( n -C \u2264 12) is increased from 77.8%(without LBO) to 83.1%(with LBO); especially, the content of C 10 components has a sharp increase. Moreover, the liquid compositions are changed. Particularly, the percentage of limonene increased dramatically from 7.54% for thermal degradation to 13.58%. These results suggest that the enhanced catalytic effects on pyrolysis of tires in the catalytic systems are due to the improved interactions between tires and catalysts with the help of LBO. Therefore, it is possible to improve the process economics of scrap tires by catalytic copyrolysis with LBO, which can not only increase the pyrolysis rate remarkably but also produce high-value oil products. Keywords Pyrolysis Waste tires ZSM-5 Lubricant base oil Catalysis 1 Introduction Nowadays, waste tires have not only caused serious environmental problems but also caused huge waste of resources. Among the different alternatives for tire recycling, such as retreating, reclaiming, incineration, grinding, biodegradation, etc., [1\u20134] pyrolysis has been proposed as a viable recycling technology. Pyrolysis involves an oxygen-free thermal decomposition process. The rubbers are decomposed to form gases and liquids that can be used as fuels or sources of chemicals, and inorganic compositions, such as steel and the non-volatile carbon black, which remain as solid residues to be recycled in worthwhile applications [5\u20137] . However, owing to technical problems as well as economic and legal factors, the processes of pyrolysis of tires have not been cost effective until now. In order to enhance the economic viability of the pyrolysis of tires, a great deal of work has been done [8\u201316] . Williams and Brindle [8\u201310] proposed a two-stage catalytic pyrolysis process to increase the concentrations of high-value chemicals in pyrolytic oil. Pakdel et al. [11] obtained dl-limonene rich fraction by vacuum pyrolysis of tires. Several active carbons with high surface areas have been produced by activating the residual chars with steam and CO 2 [12\u201316] . Those processes mainly aim to enhance the economic value of the char and oil. On the other hand, lowering pyrolysis temperature and increasing reaction rate are also two of the key points in pyrolysis of tire. ZSM-5 zeolite has proved to be an efficient catalyst for catalytic degradation of polymers due to its strong acidity for the carbon\u2013carbon bond scission and unique pore structure to reduce coke formation [17] . In this paper scrap tires were pyrolyzed over ZSM-5 zeolite and the enhanced catalytic activities of ZSM-5 were discussed when combined with the use of lubricant base oil (LBO). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Waste tires (225/60R16, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company) were supplied by Duel Chemical (Dalian) Co., Ltd., China. Scrap tires were shredded to produce 2.5\u20133 cm long and 1\u20131.5 cm wide sheets with about 10 g of weight. Rubber compositions of scrap tires were determined by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) (TAQ500, USA) according to DTG curve simulation method [18] , and typical analysis of the tire was shown in Table 1 . A ZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al: 50) was provided by Catalyst Plant of NanKai University (TianJin, China). The lubricant base oil (500SN, flash point: 266 \u00b0C; S = 780 ppm; N = 172 ppm) was supplied by Chengdu Wanrun Petroleum Chemical Co. Ltd. 2.2 Apparatus and procedures The pyrolysis of tires was carried out in an in-house designed stainless steel reactor (60 ml volume) by batch operation. Fig. 1 shows the schematic representation of the pyrolysis apparatus. In a typical catalytic copyrolysis run, about 10 g of materials were mixed with 0.005 g of ZSM-5 and 0.005 g of LBO. The air of the reactor was purged out with a nitrogen flow of 30 ml min \u22121 . The reactor was heated from room temperature to 120 \u00b0C during 20 min and the temperature was held for 60 min. Then the temperature was increased from 120 \u00b0C to 430 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 , and held until no liquid was produced. The outlet of the reactor was connected to a condenser maintained at 0 \u00b0C. The reaction products were classified into three groups: gases, liquid hydrocarbons and residue. Liquid product was defined as the material collected in a burette; residue was defined as the compounds remaining inside the reactor after the experiment by subtracting the weight of catalyst and that of steel wires, which was quantified by separating them manually from the solid residue left and weighing them. And the weight of gas product was calculated by the difference between the weights of loaded amount of tire deducted the weight of steel wires and the weights of liquid and residue. And the yields of liquid, residue and gas are calculated as follows: Liquid Yield % = W Liquid W Tire \u2212 W Steel wire \u00d7 100 Residue Yield % = W Residue W Tire \u2212 W Steel wire \u00d7 100 Gas Yield % = W Gas W Tire \u2212 W Steel wire \u00d7 100 Where W Liquid , W Tire , W steel wire , W Residue , W Gas are weight of liquid product, tire, steel wires, residue and gas respectively. The yield of product is the sum of the yield of gas and liquid. 2.3 Products characterization Elemental analysis (C, H, and N) of the pyrolysis oils was determined with an elemental analyzer (Carlo Erba 1106, Italy), and sulfur and chlorine amounts of the pyrolysis oils were determined using Combustion-Ion Chromatography method (SYS200, PR China). The pyrolysis oils were obtained using an Agilent HP 6890N gas chromatography equipped with an Agilent HP 5973N mass selective detector (GC/MS) and a 30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm DB-5 capillary column. Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The column temperature was programmed from 35 \u00b0C (kept for 5 min) to 210 \u00b0C at 5 \u00b0C/min and then to 290 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C/min. The final temperature was held at 290 \u00b0C for 20 min. On the basis of the GC analysis, the carbon number distribution of the liquids was determined using NP-gram method [19] . Moreover, the detailed compositions (wt%) of the pyrolysis oils were obtained, and the corresponding aliphatic alkane, cycloalkane, aliphatic alkene, cycloalkene and single ring aromatic compositions were summarized. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires Pyrolysis temperature is an important parameter in tire pyrolysis. Laresgoiti et al. [5] studied tire pyrolysis in the range 300\u2013700 \u00b0C and found no influence of temperature on pyrolysis yields over 500 \u00b0C. Moreover, according to Barbooti et al. [7] the optimal temperature is 430 \u00b0C for the production of pyrolytic carbon and oil in pyrolysis of scrap tires under inert gas atmosphere. Therefore, both the thermal and catalytic degradation of tires were carried out at 430 \u00b0C in our experiments. The relationship between the product yield and reaction time for thermal and catalytic degradation of tires is shown in Fig. 2 . For thermal degradation, the product yield is 51.0%, and the yields of gas, liquid and residue are 17.7%, 33.3% and 49.0%, respectively ( Table 2 ), which are consistent with the results from other researchers [5] . Table 3 shows the properties of the pyrolysis oils. It can be seen that for tire pyrolysis the sulfur content in the derived oil is 0.8%, which is comparable to that in a commercial diesel; however, the nitrogen and chlorine contents are relatively higher than those in diesel. As for the liquid product distribution ( Fig. 3 ), the carbon numbers in products are from C 4 to C 20 with an average carbon number (Cnp) of 10.5 ( Table 3 ). From the specific liquid product compositions shown in Tables 4\u20138 , it can be seen that they are very complex, and contain a wide variety of alkanes and alkenes and aromatics, which are in agreement with the results from many other researchers [5\u20137] . The most abundant products are 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane, pentadiene, hexadiene, dimethylpentadiene, phenylbutene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, styrene, cumene, propylbenzene, 1-ethyl-3-methylbenzene, methylstyrene, cymene and limonene, and limonene has the highest concentration (8.08%). Limonene is the main constituent of citrus oil and has extremely fast-growing and wide industrial applications such as dispersing agents for pigments, feedstock for the production of fragrances and flavorings, etc. It is mainly derived from the thermal decomposition of polyisoprene that accounts for approximately 50\u201360% of typical truck tire formulation [11] . In order to increase the pyrolysis rate as well as to improve the quality of pyrolytic oil, the ZSM-5 zeolite was used as a catalyst. Different from the two-stage pyrolysis-catalysis process adopted by Williams and Brindle [8\u201310] , our catalytic process was a process in which the catalyst directly contacts tires so as to expect that it will exert the catalytic effects at the initial pyrolysis stage. Moreover, only 0.5% of catalyst is adopted so that it will not notably influence the quality of the residue carbon. As can be seen from Fig. 2 , the catalytic effect of ZSM-5 is so weak that the pyrolysis rate is only slightly increased. Moreover, for the processes with and without ZSM-5, the product yields ( Table 2 ) and the product distributions ( Fig. 3 ) are similar. 3.2 Catalytic pyrolysis of tire with LBO In order to enhance the catalytic effects of ZSM-5, LBO is added. As can be seen from Fig. 4 , with the addition of LBO into the catalysis system of ZSM-5, the catalytic degradation rate of tires is sharply increased. Moreover, the product yield is obviously changed compared to that of catalytic process without LBO ( Table 2 ), i.e. the liquid yield is increased from 33.6% to 48.0% with a substantial increase of 42.8%, the gas yield is decreased from 16.0% to 9.3%, and the residue yield is also decreased from 50.4% to 42.7%. These results strongly suggest that LBO caused an enhanced catalytic effect for the process of catalytic pyrolysis of tires over ZSM-5. Yanik et al. found that the copyrolysis of municipal waste plastics (MWP) together with high vacuum gas oil (HVGO) led to a synergic effect: the liquid yield increased because HVGO acted as a solvent that provided homogeneous conditions and prevented the repolymerization and formation of gaseous products during the degradation of MWP [20] . On the other hand, it was reported that no synergic effect on the pyrolysis yields was observed by the addition of waste lubricant oil to the scrap tires in the copyrolysis process [21] . In order to investigate the role of LBO in the process of catalytic pyrolysis of tires, the copyrolysis of scrap tire and LBO was conducted and the results were compared with those of the process without LBO. As can be seen from Fig. 5 , LBO does not show the synergic effect on the pyrolysis rate. Moreover, both the product yields and the product distributions obtained in the pyrolysis processes with and without LBO are similar. These results indicate that LBO itself is not responsible for the prominently enhanced pyrolysis rate of tires. Since neither ZSM-5 itself can increase the pyrolysis rate, we can deduce that the enhanced catalytic effects are due to the interactions between tire and catalysts with the help of LBO. Waste tire rubber is a kind of crosslinking polymer that is hard to mix sufficiently with the catalysts, which may be a reason for the low efficiency of the direct-contact-catalysis process. By copyrolysis with LBO, the interactions between tires and catalysts are improved, which lead to the increased catalytic activities of the catalysts. From the elemental composition of the pyrolysis oils ( Table 3 ), it can be seen that the addition of LBO or ZSM-5 caused a slight increase in the contents of nitrogen and sulfur, and for Tire/ZSM-5/LBO, the contents of nitrogen and sulfur as well as chlorine in oils are comparable to those from tire pyrolysis, indicating that LBO and ZSM-5 have no effects on lowering the contents of nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine in the produced oil. From the liquid product distribution ( Fig. 6 ), it can be seen that the heavy components decrease and the percentage of light oils ( n -C \u2264 12) increases prominently, from 77.8% (Tire/ZSM-5) to 83.1% (Tire/ZSM-5/LBO) ( Table 3 ), particularly the C 10 components are sharply increased. Moreover, the detailed analysis shows that oils from catalytic copyrolysis with LBO contained small amounts of aliphatic alkane (1.50%) and cycloalkane (2.70%) components similar to those from catalytic process without LBO ( Tables 4 and 5 ). However, the contents of aliphatic alkenes ( Table 6 ) and cycloalkenes ( Table 7 ) increase abruptly to 10.80% and 25.78% from 5.46% and 13.58%, respectively. Particularly, the content of limonene increases by 80.1%, from 7.54% to 13.58%. Besides, the contents of single ring aromatics slightly increase ( Table 8 ). Among the chemicals identified in the tire pyrolysis oils, benzene, toluene, xylenes and limonene have been considered as being those of most potential economic value. Therefore, it has been a main interest to maximize the concentrations of those chemicals in the pyrolysis oils [8\u201311] . It seems that the direct-contact-catalytic copyrolysis process is helpful to increase the content of limonene. However, the post-catalysis process using ZSM-5 as catalyst prominently increased the content of single ring aromatics, while decreased limonene content [8\u201310] , which suggests that ZSM-5 itself is not responsible for the increased limonene content. And we could also draw the same conclusion from the results of direct-contact-catalytic process using ZSM-5 without LBO ( Table 7 ). On the other hand, because the LBO amount is only 0.5%, it produced weak effects on liquid product distribution ( Fig. 7 ) and compositions of tire pyrolysis ( Tables 4\u20138 ). Roy et al. discussed the effects of process variables on production of limonene in detail [11] . The formation of limonene is dependent on the pyrolysis pressure, temperature and vapor residence time inside the reactor, and low pyrolysis pressure and temperature and short vapor residence time can increase the limonene yield [11] . Therefore, with the sharply increased pyrolysis rate in the catalytic copyrolysis process, the residence time of product vapors decreased, which prohibited the secondary pyrolysis reaction, leading to much higher limonene content. 4 Conclusion A kind of lubricant base oil (LBO) can enhance the catalytic effects of the pyrolysis of waste tires over ZSM-5 zeolite. Compared to the pyrolysis without LBO, the catalytic copyrolysis with LBO shows a sharply increased catalytic degradation rate. The liquid yield increases, whilst the gas yield and the residue yield decrease. In pyrolysis oils, the contents of nitrogen and sulfur as well as chlorine are comparable to those from tire pyrolysis, while the contents of light oils ( n -C \u2264 12) increased prominently, and the heavy components decrease. Moreover, the liquid compositions are changed and particularly the percentage of limonene sharply increased from 7.54% (Tire/ZSM-5) to 13.58% (Tire/ZSM-5/LBO). The enhanced catalytic effects are due to the improved interactions between tire and catalysts with the help of LBO since neither ZSM-5 nor LBO alone could obviously improve the pyrolysis efficiency in our pyrolysis systems. Therefore, the catalytic copyrolysis with LBO can be used to improve the process economics of scrap tires, which can not only increase markedly the pyrolysis rate but also produce high-value oil products.

The results suggest that the crystallization rate of P(BS-co-DEGS) was much slower than that of neat PBS and decreased with increase of DEGS content, while the crystallization mechanism remain unchanged. P(BS-co-DEGS) showed banded morphology, and the band spacing decreased with increase of DEGS content at a given supercooling. The spherulitic growth rate of P(BS-co-DEGS) decreased with increase in DEGS content. A transition from crystallization regime II to crystallization regime III occurred for all samples, and the transition shifted to lower temperatures with increase in DEGS content. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

The thermal stability of the resulting copolyester was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis. With the introduction of phosphorus-containing segments, polyester onset weight-loss temperatures in both nitrogen and air are enhanced. Thermal degradation kinetics were analyzed using the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method, which showed a decreased activation energy for the copolyester compared with that for neat PTT, strongly suggesting that the increased onset weight-loss temperature in nitrogen is a result of enhanced carbonization. Microscale combustion calorimetry was carried out to test the flammability behavior of the copolyester; improved flame-retardant properties were observed with incorporated phosphorus components. Py-GC-MS testing revealed that the pyrolysis of phosphorus-containing copolyester is not significantly affected by the phosphorus incorporation. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The results show that TLCP can dramatically improve the flame retardancy and the melt dripping behavior of PET. Moreover, the apparent activation energies of thermal oxidative degradation of the blends were evaluated using Kissinger and Flynn\u2013Wall\u2013Ozawa methods. It is found that addition of TLCP improve thermal stability and restrain thermal decomposition of PET in air, especially at the primary degradation stage. Py-GC/MS analysis shows that there are remarkable changes in the pyrolysis products when TLCP are blended into PET.

The thermal behaviour, burning behaviour and mechanical properties of the flame-retardant PLA systems have been investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), vertical burning test (UL-94), limiting oxygen index (LOI), cone calorimeter test (CCT) and tensile test. The flame retardance mechanism has been studied via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and P content analysis. The UL-94 ratings of PLA\u2019s containing 7phr (W 7P ) and 10phr (W 10P ) of WLA-3 were enhanced to V-0 from no rating for neat PLA. However, the cone calorimetry of flame-retardant PLA (W 7P ) only showed a little decrease in heat release rate (HRR), peak of heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR) compared to neat PLA. TGA results showed that the PLA containing different amounts of WLA-3 presented more complicated thermal decomposition behaviours than neat PLA. Additionally, the results from DSC and tensile tests showed that the addition of WLA-3 into PLA had a slight impact on the crystallization behaviours and tensile properties.",

        "abstract": "Thermal stability of poly( p -dioxanone) (PPDO) was investigated isothermally and non-isothermally under air atmosphere using thermogravimetry (TG). The addition of 4-benzoyl-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one (PMBP) could enhance successfully the thermal stability of PPDO compared with those of as-prepared and purified PPDO at temperature below about 230 \u00b0C. The activation energies for thermal degradation (\u0394 E td ) were evaluated at different weight loss values from TG data using the procedure recommended by MacCallum et al. The \u0394 E td values of as-prepared PPDO, purified PPDO and PPDO containing 1.0 wt% PMBP were in the ranges of 20\u201350, 35\u201360, and 56\u201388 kJ mol \u22121 , respectively, when they were evaluated at weight loss values of 10\u201380%. The remaining weights increase with the amounts of PMBP added up to 1.5 wt%. The mechanism for the enhanced thermal stability of PPDO was discussed. Keywords Poly( p -dioxanone) Thermal stability Activation energy Chelator PMBP 1 Introduction Poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) or poly( p -dioxanone), (PPDO) is a biodegradable and biocompatible semi-crystalline poly(ether ester), which has a T g of \u221210 \u00b0C and T m of 110 \u00b0C [1] , and good mechanical properties with a tensile strength close to 7000 psi for an ultimate elongation ranging from 500% to 600% [2] . It has been a candidate not only for medical use but also for general uses such as films, molded products, laminates, foams, non-woven materials, adhesives, and coatings [3,4] . However, due to its low ceiling temperature [5\u20137] ( T c = 265 \u00b0C), its thermal processing such as melt molding and spinning will cause significant thermal degradation of PPDO. Therefore, the use of PPDO as bulk material is hampered by its poor melt stability. The studies on the thermal stability of PPDO have been reported. Ishikiriyama and coworkers [8] determined the heat capacities of PPDO both in solid state and liquid state. Kricheldorf and Damrau [9] found that the thermal degradation of PPDO began at above 200 \u00b0C and reached almost quantitative decomposition at 320 \u00b0C. Yang et al. [10] investigated the kinetics of thermal degradation and thermal oxidative degradation of PPDO. Nishida et al. [11,12] studied the thermal decomposition behavior of PPDO and presented the thermal degradation mechanism that the main decomposition of PPDO proceeded by the unzipping depolymerization. Although the thermal degradation of PPDO has been thoroughly studied, there is only a few reports on the enhancement of the melt stability of PPDO. Trichloroacetyl isocyanate (TCAI) [13] and the acid anhydrides such as pyromellitic anhydride [14] , methylcyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride (MCDA), and 4-methylcyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride (MNDA) [12] were employed as end-capped reagents to react with the hydroxyl end-group of PPDO chains. The addition of these end-capped reagents into PPDO could suppress the main chain scission under the heating conditions in the melt processing [12] . The end-capped method is available for the enhancement of the melt stability of low molecular weight PPDO, but for those of high molecular weight PPDO, its effects may be decreased due to less end groups and higher melt viscosity of PPDO. In addition, ring-opening copolymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one with different lactones was also used to enhance the thermal stability of PPDO [13] . However, the resulting copolymers obtained by solution or bulk polymerization have low molecular weights. It is still needed to solve some technical problems for increasing the molecular weight of copolymer. According to the thermal degradation mechanism of PPDO [11] , the residual catalyst metal ion such as tin, zinc, and aluminium can catalyze intra- and inter-molecular transesterifications and accelerate the thermal decomposition of PPDO. If the catalytic activity of the residual metal ion is restrained, the melt stability of PPDO can be enhanced. Usually, this suppression is carried out by means of addition of some additives. Some additives as catalyst deactivators have been reported to stabilize poly- l -lactide (PLA) in the melt. Such additives include benzoyl peroxide [15,16] , 1,4-dianthraquinone [17,18] , 2-hydroxy-2,4,6-cycloheptatrienone (tropolone) [19,20] . As far as the authors know, no available data have been reported on the enhancement of the thermal stability of PPDO by means of the addition of additives. In this present paper, 4-benzoyl-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one (PMBP), a metal chelator, is employed to stabilize PPDO in the melt under air atmosphere. Characterization for melt-stabilization of PPDO was performed by using thermogravimetry (TG). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials 2.1.1 Polymer preparation PPDO was synthesized in our laboratory [10,21] . Ring-opening polymerization of p -dioxanone was performed in bulk with magnetic stirring in flame-dried glass reactors. The reactors were evacuated and purged with argon several times prior to addition of PDO and stannous octoate catalyst solution with a syringe. Then the reactors were immersed into a temperature-adjusted silicone oil bath for pre-determined intervals. The reactors were cooled down rapidly to room temperature. The polymer obtained was milled into small chips and stored in a desiccator over silica gel. 2.1.2 Purification The as-polymerized PPDO was purified by precipitation from the phenol/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (2:3 w/w) solution with methanol [10,21] . The precipitated flakes of PPDO were filtered, washed with fresh methanol, dried under vacuum to a constant weight and stored in a desiccator over silica gel. 2.1.3 Addition of PMBP A desired amount of PMBP (m.p. 118\u2013120 \u00b0C) was mixed with the as-prepared PPDO in a reactor equipped with a mechanical agitator under nitrogen atmosphere at 140 \u00b0C for 30 min. The mixture was milled into small chips and stored in a desiccator over silica gel. 2.2 Characterization 2.2.1 Intrinsic viscosity measurement Intrinsic viscosities of PPDO were measured at 25 \u00b0C with c = 0.1 g/dl in phenol/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (2:3 w/w) solution using an Ubbelohde viscometer. 2.2.2 Infrared analysis The infrared absorption spectra were performed on a Nicolet FTIR 170SX infrared spectrometer using KBr wafer. 2.2.3 Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) ICP-AES determination of metallic residues in PPDO was performed with a Plasma Spectrometer, type IRIS-HR-DUO from Thermo Electron. A measurement average of three samples was performed for each datum. About 0.2 g of PPDO samples were digested with concentrated nitric acid and perchloric acid. After cooling, the system was brought to suitable concentration for ICP-AES measurement with dilute nitric acid. Standards were prepared by diluting 1000 ppm stock solutions purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich to suitable concentrations. 2.2.4 Thermogravimetric analysis TG measurements were conducted with a Dupont 2100 system in platinum pans under a steady air flow of 80 ml min \u22121 . Sample weights are ca. 5 mg. The weight losses of the specimens were measured isothermally under the constant holding temperatures (180\u2013220 \u00b0C) for 60 min or non-isothermally with heating at a constant rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 up to 400 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Non-isothermal degradation Fig. 1 shows the remaining weight percentages of various PPDO samples as a function of temperature, which were obtained non-isothermally at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 with a steady flow of air. The relevant characteristics were summarized in Table 1 . As a result of purification, the level of tin content decreases only from 99.8 to 83.9 ppm, indicating that tin is difficult to remove through usual purification process of precipitation from the phenol/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane solution with methanol [10,21] . The result is in agreement with that reported by Cam and Marucci [22] on the purification of PLLA through precipitation from methylene chloride with methanol. The purified PPDO has higher intrinsic viscosity, which means that it has a lower amount of terminal groups. In addition, it has also a lower amount of residual tin catalyst. According to the thermal degradation mechanism of PPDO [11] , the terminal groups and residual tin catalyst have less effect on the unzipping depolymerization of purified PPDO than those of unpurified PPDO. Therefore, the purified PPDO exhibits a higher thermal stability than the others. PPDO containing 1.0 wt% PMBP has a significant low ending temperature because of the degradation of PPDO caused by PMBP at high temperature especially over 230 \u00b0C. However, at temperature below 230 \u00b0C, PPDO containing 1.0 wt% PMBP shows a higher thermal stability compared with the as-prepared PPDO, which reveals that PMBP plays a stabilization role in thermal degradation of PPDO. 3.2 Isothermal degradation In order to investigate in detail the relevant thermal degradation behaviors and stability of PPDO in air, the isothermal measurements were performed at constant holding temperatures of 180\u2013220 \u00b0C. Fig. 2 illustrates the remaining weight percentage of various PPDO as a function of degradation time at different holding temperatures. At 180 \u00b0C, the remaining weights of PPDO containing 1.0 wt% PMBP are much higher than those of as-prepared PPDO and purified PPDO. The remaining weights of the latter two samples decrease to 41% and 49% at 30 min, and to 16% and 21% at 60 min, whilst that of PPDO containing 1.0 wt% PMBP decreases only to 87% and to 61%. Even at 200 \u00b0C, the thermal stabilization of PPDO melt caused by PMBP is still remarkable although the difference among weight loss behaviors of various PPDO samples becomes smaller with the increase of temperature. At 220 \u00b0C, PPDO containing 1.0 wt% shows the highest remaining weight within the starting 40 min, but its remaining weights are slightly lower than the others with the increase of time. This result is very similar to that obtained from non-isothermal degradation of PPDO. The results obtained from Fig. 2 reveal that the thermal stability of PPDO in air is enhanced by adding PMBP below 220 \u00b0C, which can be ascribed to the deactivation of the residual catalyst metal ion caused by the chelation of PMBP. To calculate the activation energy \u0394 E td for the thermal weight loss process, we used the methods recommended by MacCallum et al. [23\u201327] and utilized successfully by Babanalbandi et al. [28] and Tsuji and Fukui [29] . The t (min) for a weight loss X (wt%) can be expressed as a function of degradation temperature T (K) using the following equation: (1) ln ( t ) = ln [ F ( 1 \u2212 X / 100 ) ] \u2212 ln ( A ) + \u0394 E td / R T where F (1 \u2212 X /100) is an undefined function of X , A is a constant and R is the universal gas constant. The data obtained at various temperatures for a series of weight loss fractions in the range of 10\u201380% were fitted to Eq. (1) using a regression analysis (see Fig. 3 ) from which the evaluations of the activation energy were found. The values of \u0394 E td obtained for several weight loss fractions are given in Table 2 . It was found that the regression linear relationships for purified PPDO and PPDO containing 1.0 wt% PMBP were very good by using Eq. (1) , while that for as-prepared PPDO was poor. The reason for this behaviour is not understood at present. The \u0394 E td values of as-prepared PPDO, purified PPDO, and PPDO containing 1.0 wt% PMBP increased with the increase of weight loss and were in the ranges of 20\u201350, 35\u201360, and 56\u201388 kJ mol \u22121 , respectively. On an average, the \u0394 E td values of PPDO containing 1.0 wt% PMBP were 30 and 20 kJ mol \u22121 , higher than those of as-prepared PPDO and purified PPDO, respectively. This again confirms that the thermal stability of PPDO was enhanced by adding PMBP. Fig. 4 shows the isothermal degradation curves of as-prepared PPDO containing different amounts of PMBP at 180 \u00b0C in air. PPDO containing PMBP has a remarkably higher remaining weight than PPDO without PMBP and the weight loss curves have a relatively small slope within the starting 20 min, while PPDO without PMBP starts to decompose drastically without any relatively slow decomposing process. The remaining weights increase with the increase of PMBP content although there is a intercross in curves between 0.2 and 0.5 wt%. To achieve good thermal stabilization of PPDO melt, the addition of adequate amount of PMBP is necessary. In comparison to the tin content (99.8 ppm) in PPDO, the content of PMBP needed for maximum stabilization is very high, about 10 2 surplus. This is ascribed to a restricted chelation between PMBP and metal ions due to a high melt viscosity, which leads to a low chelation efficiency. The result is very similar to that reported by Wachsen et al. [19] on the melt-stabilization of PLA by means of the addition of tropolone. It is well known that PMBP is an excellent chelator to a majority of metal ions and has been applied extensively in analytical chemistry and radiochemistry. PMBP contains two phenyl groups in its chemical structure and has a good thermal stability in air. At the same time, PMBP has also an appropriate melting point of 118\u2013120 \u00b0C, which matches the processing temperature of PPDO. In addition, PMBP has two tautomeric forms: one is ketone form and another is enol form (shown in Scheme 1 ). The two forms can be observed from the FTIR spectrum of PMBP indicated in Fig. 5 . The broad and round absorption band at 2581.0 cm \u22121 is attributed to the vibrations of intra-molecular hydrogen bonds between enol hydroxyl and ketone carbonyl groups, which shows the existence of enol form. The bands at 1644.0 and 1600.0 cm \u22121 are the characteristic absorption peaks of \u03b2-diketone, which indicate the existence of ketone form. Chelation of PMBP with metal ion is performed by means of the enol form (see Scheme 2 ). Blended with PPDO, PMBP can form chelate complex with tin ion. Therefore, the addition of PMBP can deactivate the residual catalyst and results in the enhancement of the thermal stabilization of PPDO. 4 Conclusions Purified PPDO obtained by precipitation from its solutions with methanol still contains residual catalyst, and its thermal stability is slightly higher than that of as-prepared PPDO in the process of isothermal degradation. At temperatures below about 230 \u00b0C, the enhancement of the thermal stability of PPDO can be achieved by adding a chelator PMBP of ca. 1.0 wt%. The activation energies for thermal degradation (\u0394 E td ) are evaluated at different weight loss values from TG data using the procedure recommended by MacCallum et al. The \u0394 E td values of as-prepared PPDO, purified PPDO and PPDO containing 1.0 wt% PMBP are in the ranges of 20\u201350, 35\u201360, and 56\u201388 kJ mol \u22121 , respectively, when they are evaluated at weight loss values of 10\u201380%. The remaining weights of PPDO increase with the increase of PMBP content in the interested content range (up to 1.5 wt%). It is possible to improve the thermal stability of PPDO in melt by adding PMBP, which deactivates tin (catalyst) by the formation of stable chelate complexes. This is a simple and effective method for the enhancement of the thermal stability of PPDO.

        "abstract": "A novel multiblock aromatic-aliphatic copolyester poly(ethylene-co-1,6- hexene terephthalate)-copoly(1,4-dioxan-2one) (PEHT-PPDO) was successfully synthesized via the chainextension reaction of dihydroxyl teminated poly(ethylene-cohexane terephthalate) (PEHT-OH) with dihydroxyl teminated poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) (PPDO-OH) prepolymers, using toluene2,4-diisocyanate as a chain extender. To produce PEHT-OH prepolymer with an appropriate melting point which can match the reaction temperature of PEHT-OH prepolymer with PPDOOH prepolymer, 1,6-hexanediol was used to disturb the regularity of poly(ethylene terephthalate) segments. The chemical structures and molecular weights of PEHT-PPDO copolymers were characterized by 1H NMR, FTIR, and GPC The DSC data showed that PPDO-OH segments were miscible well with PEHT-OH segments in amorphous state and that the crystallization of copolyester was predominantly contributed by PPDO segments. The TGA results indicated that the thermal stability of PEHT-PPDO was improved comparing with PPDO homopolymer. The novel aromatic-aliphatic copolyesters have good mechanical properties and could find applications in the field of biodegradable polymer materials. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

When the ROP of PDO was carried out at 100 degrees C for 6.5 h, the viscosity-average molecular weight (M(v)) of poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) reached 53.2 kg/mol. The kinetics of ring-opening polymerization of PDO under microwave irradiation were investigated and the polymerization reaction was accurately first-order with respect to monomer concentration. The reaction rate was greatly accelerated by microwave irradiation, compared with conventional heating. The resultant PPDO was used as carrier and drug-release systems were prepared using ibuprofen (IBU) as model drug with 10, 15 and 20% loading. The release behavior of the systems was investigated in phosphate buffer solution at 37 degrees C and the release of IBU from the system was sustained and steady. The resultant PPDO could be well used as the carrier for the delivery drug.",

In this paper, the biodegradation behavior of P(3HB,4HB)/PLA blends in real soil environments was for the first time investigated via appearance analysis, SEM, FTIR and elemental analysis of their degraded residues. It was found that P(3HB,4HB) and P(3HB,4HB)/PLA blends can be biodegraded under real soil conditions. The order of biodegradability is as follows: PHA-100 [P(3HB,4HB)] > PHA-75 [P(3HB,4HB)/PLA, 75/25] > PHA-50 [P(3HB,4HB)/PLA, 50/50] > PHA-25 [P(3HB,4HB)/PLA, 25/75] > PLA, which correlates well with the PLA content. Due to the different degradation mechanisms, P(3HB,4HB) and PLA have the fastest degradation rate in 20 and 40 cm soil depth, respectively. Their blends also have different degradation rates in different depths of soil. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The effect of the content of various components on the flame retardancy of the composites was studied via limiting oxygen index (LOI) and vertical burning test (UL-94). The results show that when the total loading of flame retardants is 30% and the ratio of IFR to APP is 1 to 2, the LOI value of the composite reaches 29%. However, when 0.5% OMMT is added into the flame retardant system, the flame retardancy of the composites has a significant improvement: LOI value of 31% and UL-94 V-0 rating. Scanning electronic microscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) were used to investigate the morphology and structure of char residues after burning. The results show that MMT can promote the PP/IFR system to form harder and more compact charring layers which reduces the transition speed of oxygen. A possible flame-retardant mechanism was explored.",

TGA-FTIR and Pyrolysis-GC/MS were used to investigate the corresponding volatile products under nitrogen atmosphere. Both PTT and its phosphorus-containing copolyesters showed one decomposition stage between 330 and 446\u00b0C. The introduction of phosphorus decreased the onset decomposition temperature due to the comparative weak P-C bond. No obvious absorption peak of P-C bond is detected with FTIR in volatile products for its low content and weak absorption. The analysis of volatile products of TGA and Pyrolysis-GC/MS revealed that they underwent different way of thermal decomposition for the different decomposition conditions. Possible thermal decomposition schemes are proposed and mass spectra of some decomposition products are also listed. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Addition of either AP or APBu resulted in an increased LOI value, UL-94 V-0 rating, and decreased heat release in cone calorimetric tests. However, different chemical structures of two flame retardants caused different flame-retardant effects: APBu endowed PA6 a higher LOI value and better UL-94 result than did AP. Decomposition pathways of AP, APBu, and the corresponding composites were investigated using TGA, TG-IR, Py-GC/MS, and FTIR characterization of the residues. The introduction of AP changed the thermal stability and decomposition behavior of the composites due to the cross-linking reactions occurred, which were proved by rheological analysis and TG-DSC. APBu could not essentially affect the composition of pyrolysis products and decomposition behaviors, but mainly produced phosphorus-containing free radical scavengers in the gaseous phase, which were positive to flame retardation. Finally, the proposed flame-retardant mechanisms of such systems were summarized. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

The compositions and structures were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H NMR). The miscibility of amorphous phase and crystallization behaviors of the two blocks were investigated by standard differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), temperature modulated DSC (TMDSC), polarized light optical microscopy (POM), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). When the block length of PBS and PES were less than 4710 g mol -1, the amorphous phases of the two blocks were miscible. As the block length increased to more than 5430 g mol -1, the amorphous phases of the two blocks changed to be partially miscible, and the miscibility decreased with further increasing the block lengths. The crystallizability of both PBS and PES blocks increased with an increase in size of their blocks. POM observation showed that the copolymers displayed banded spherulitic morphologies, and the crystallization of PES happened in confined space after crystallization of PBS blocks. WAXD analysis suggested that the crystals of the copolymers were composed of crystals of both PES and PBS blocks. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Amphiphilic biodegradable graft copolymer, poly(vinyl alcohol)-graft-poly(p-dioxanone) (PVA-g-PPDO), was used to prepare a new biodegradable material by blending with poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO). The in vitro degradation properties of the copolymer and blends with different contents of PVA-g-PPDO were studied in phosphate buffer at 37 degrees C. The degradation processes of the PVA-g-PPDO and its blends with the PPDO were monitored by weight loss, viscosimetry, water uptake, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy. The results of inherent viscosity and weight loss reveal that the PVA-g-PPDO has a different in vitro degradation behavior from that of PPDO, and the introducing of copolymer into the blending system may enhance the degradability of PPDO when the contents of copolymer is higher than 5%. The change of the degree of crystallization (Dc) of copolymer and blends derived from the DSC also shows that the copolymer and blends have faster degradation rates than the neat PPDO during the testing period. A degradation mechanism of the blends was postulated based on the results of the weight retention, inherent viscosity measurement, and DSC.",

A partially exfoliated and partially intercalated structure was confirmed by WAXD and TEM. The crystallization behaviors of neat PLA and nanocomposite were studied by POM and DSC, and it was found that OREC had a great effect on the overall crystallization rate and spherulitic texture of PLA. The presence of OREC could toughen PLA greatly. For example, when 1 wt.% OREC was added, the elongation at break of the nanocomposite was increased to 210%.

        "abstract": "The effect of polycarbodiimide (PCD) on hydrolytic stability of poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) was investigated by hydrolytic degradation of PPDO and PPDO added with PCD (PPDOCD) in phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.4) at 37\u00b0C. The variation of weight, water absorption, pH, molecular weight, tensile properties, surface morphologies, and thermal properties with degradation time were evaluated. After 11 weeks, the weight loss and water absorption of PPDO was 24 and 30%, respectively, but the corresponding values were only 3 and 5% for PPDOCD5, where 5 represents the weight percentage of PCD added; the molecular weight of PPDO decreased much faster than that of PPDOCD. The pH of the solution was monitored for 15 weeks and a final pH value of the solution involving PPDOCD5 was 6.81 whereas that of PPDO solution was 3.77, indicating that more acid fragments from PPDO samples migrate into the buffer solution. Surface morphological changes showed a better physical integrity for PPDOCD samples and they also kept their mechanical properties for a longer time than PPDO samples. These results revealed that PCD can retard the hydrolysis degradation of PPDO and enhance its hydrolytic stability. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Dialdehyde sweet potato starch (DASS) with various carbonyl contents has been prepared using sodium periodate to oxidize sweet potato starch in the neutral condition. The structure properties of DASS were analyzed by SEM and XRD. The results demonstrate that DASS with the higher carbonyl content comprise lower crystallization. The thermal, mechanical and biodegradable properties of TPDASS were investigated, and the results illustrate that the moisture adsorption and biodegradable ratio decreases with the Tg of TPDASS with higher carbonyl content. This phenomenon could be attributed to the partial cross-linking of DASS which is due to semi-acetal formation by itself. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties of TPDASS95 were less sensitive to the content of plasticizer. The tensile strength could reach even 12.9 MPa while the water content was higher than 13.5% and the biodegradable ratio was 28%. \u00a9 (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

The PPDO/PEG blends have different weight ratios of 95/5, 90/10, 80/20 and 70/30. Crystallization of homopolymers and blends were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). When 5% of PEG was blended, the crystallization exothermal peaks ( T c ) of PPDO increased sharply and the crystallization exothermal peaks ( T c ) of PEG decreased slightly compared with the homopolymers. The crystallization rates of both components increased, and caused greater relative crystallization degree ( X t %). But when the content of PEG was more than 5%, the crystalline behaviors of blends had no more significant changes accordingly. The melting points of each sample varied little over the entire composition range in this study. The nonisothermal crystallization of PPDO homopolymer and blend (PPDO/PEG = 70/30) were also studied by DSC. The crystallization began at a higher temperature when the cooling rates were slower. The nonisothermal crystallization kinetics of blends was analyzed by Ozawa equation. The results showed that the Ozawa equation failed to describe the whole crystallization of the blend, but Mo equation could depict the nonisothermal crystallization perfectly.

        "abstract": "In this paper, effect of phase morphology on water diffusion in phosphorus-containing aromatic liquid crystalline copolyester (P-TLCP) named as poly(-hydroxybenzate-co-DOPO-benzenediol dihydrodiphenyl ether terephthalate) (PHDDT) was investigated by two-dimensional correlation infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy, in order to understand well the relationship between structure and properties of P-TLCP. The phase morphologies of the PHDDT films were observed by polarized light microscope. The experimental results showed that the clear nematic texture, which was observed for PHDDT film treated at 250 C for 3 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. However, lots of bright spots were observed for untreated PHDDT film due to weak crystallization of PHDDT molecules. Moreover, the density of the untreated PHDDT film (1.1631 \u00b1 0.0257 g/cm -3) was lower than that of the treated one (1.2969 \u00b1 0.0134 g/cm-3), indicating that the arrangement of the molecules in treated PHDDT film was compact in comparison with that in untreated one. Therefore, the average diffusion coefficient of water in treated PHDDT film was lower than that in untreated one. The mechanisms of water diffusion into PHDDT films with different phase morphologies can be obtained through 2DIR analysis in OH stretching and bending bands. It was found that water diffused into the treated PHDDT film by forming moderate hydrogen bonds prior to forming strong and weak hydrogen bonds, while diffused into the untreated one by forming strong and weak hydrogen bonds prior to forming moderate hydrogen bonds. It was also found that the spectral intensity of PO varied prior to that of CO during water diffusion into untreated PHDDT film, which was reversed for treated PHDDT film. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Unique crosslinkable unsaturated polyesters were prepared by a one-pot lipase-catalyzed copolymerization of crude linoleic acid (LA), glycerol (G) and 1,18-cis-9-octanedecenedioic acid (oleic diacid, OD). The lipase used is Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB) immobilized on Lewatit (N435). Experiments were conducted to assess N435's efficiency of forming poly(OD-co-G-co-LA) as a function of: (i) LA content in the co-monomer feed and (ii) reaction time. For comonomer feed ratio (OD:G:LA) 1:1:0.67, Mn reached \u223c9500 in 8 h, trisubstituted G-units increased to 64% and monomer was largely depleted. When LA and OD remained in products, a lower temperature thermal decomposition peak at about 280\u00b0C was observed in addition to a higher temperature decomposition peak at \u223c475\u00b0C. By increasing LA content in the comonomer feed from 1:1:1 to 1:1:1.33, Mn decreased from 11,000 to 6300 while trisubstituted G-units increased from 92 to nearly 100%. Thus, by varying the feed ratio of LA, polymeric triglyceride-type structures were formed with control of chain length and trisubstituted G-unit content. Since G-units may be substituted in various ways with OD and LA, calculations were performed that determined the relative proportion of different substitution patterns in products. A hypothetical structure showing general characteristics of the substitution at glycerol units for one such product is presented. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The temporal changes in appearance, water absorption, number-average molecular weight (Mn), glass transition temperature, melting temperature, and crystallinity of the samples were traced. The results showed that the heterogeneous degradation and bulk-erosion were general mechanisms for PLA and its TiO 2 nanocomposites. The change in surface morphology and molecular weight after hydrolysis revealed that the hydrolysis of nanocomposites occurred at the interface of PLA matrix and nanofillers, and the degradation rate was accelerated by the addition of the TiO 2 nanofillers. The dispersion of nanofillers in polymer matrix affected the water absorption and degradation rate. The rapid increase of crystallinity also affected the degradation rate of nanocomposites. The present study suggested that the hydrolyzability of PLA could be controlled by adding TiO 2 nanoparticles. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The crystallization behavior of neat PTT and phosphorus-containing PTT copolyester with specific block chain structure (PTTDs, obtained by solid-state polymerization (SSP)) has been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized microscopy (POM) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The overall crystallization kinetics study shows that crystallization is retarded with introduction of a phosphorus-containing segment. This retardation effect is obvious for PTTD10; however, no greater retardation can be observed with further increasing the phosphorus content, which is attributed to the hindering effect of phosphorus-containing segment and specific chain structure, and is in accordance with the crystallization morphology. The crystallization rate of PTTDs is much lower at high crystallization temperature than that of PTT, which can be explained by the diluent effect of the non-crystallizable chain segment. The result of spherulite growth is in accordance with DSC study. The rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) is also calculated, which increases with increasing phosphorus content, suggesting that RAF is not the main factor for retarded crystallization. The main factors of retarded crystallization are probably caused by the diluent effect and the hindering effect of the specific chain structure. With incorporation of phosphorus-containing segments, the transition temperature is slightly changed; however, the equilibrium melting temperature (Tm 0) of the copolyester decreases. The phosphorus-containing segment plays the role of nucleation agent at regime III. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The novel biodegradable polymers were characterized by 1H-NMR, DSC, POM and WAXD. DSC measurement shows that PPDOES has only one Tg, which means that PPDO has good compatibility with PES. Beside this, the glass transition temperatures and the melting temperatures of PPDOES increased with the increase of PES content. The crystallization rate of PPDOES was slower than that of PPDO as confirmed by DSC and POM. The diffraction peaks of PPDOES appear at the same 20 angles as that of homopolymers, suggesting that PPDO and PES segment of the chainextended products reserve their own crystallization form. The results of thermal oxidative degradation show that chain-extended products have better thermal stability than PPDO.",

The influences of chain structure, microphase separating morphology on shape memory effect, and biocompatibility were investigated systematically. The TEM observation of PPDO-PTMEG poly(ether-ester)-polyether exhibited the relationship between characteristic microphase separating morphology and shape memory effect. Interestingly, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis indicated that T g,PPDO was close to T c,PTMEG, which provided the possibility that the reversible phase combined PTMEG segments and the amorphous phase of PPDO segments. The synergistic effect ensured copolymers owning both high R f and R r (96.6% and 92.9% with PTMEG segments only 15% in weight fraction), as well as the mechanical properties when T > T trans. Moreover, biocompatible evaluation results showed that the cell adhesion and proliferation could be enhanced on copolymers with more PTMEG segments, indicating potential application in minimally invasive surgery. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) analysis illustrated that an exfoliated structure of PCL/MMT nanocomposite was obtained. The nonisothermal crystallization kinetics of poly(-caprolactone) and PCL/MMT nanocomposite was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at various cooling rates. The values of half-time of crystallization (t1/2) and crystallization rate constant (Zc) showed that crystallization rate increased with the increase of cooling rates for both PCL and PCL/MMT nanocomposite; however, the crystallization rate of PCL/MMT nanocomposite was faster than that of PCL at a given cooling rate.",

Reaction kinetics of incorporation was studied choosing 30 wt% DDP content as representative example. The reaction rate constant k f was calculated to be 1.68 h -1. The intrinsic viscosity increased with the increase of t ssp, and decreased with the increase of DDP content. The sequence distribution of resulted copolyester was also analyzed with 1H NMR. Results suggested that all of the samples possess block chemical structure, and the degree of randomness increased with the increase of transesterification. For the transesterification reaction occurs only in amorphous phase of the material, the copolyester exhibited greater tendency to form block constitution when increasing DDP content. DSC investigation further confirmed the non-random constitution of the resulted copolyester. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The structure of denitrogenated ABS has been characterized using elemental analysis, FTIR, 1 H-NMR, and solid state 13 C CP-MAS NMR, indicating sequential hydrolysis as a plausible mechanism of elimination of N from ABS. The effects of reaction conditions such as solvent selection, reaction temperature, alkaline species and concentration, as well as PEG molecular weight were evaluated. At optimal conditions (THF, PEG600, 4.3\u00a0wt % of NaOH), as much as 93.1% of the original nitrogen content of ABS was removed in 2\u00a0h at 160\u00a0\u00b0C, while it is only 35.6% without PEG. This clearly demonstrates the high-efficiency of a PEG/hydroxides catalytic system for denitrogenation of ABS, stressing the potential of this method for denitrogenation of other N-containing polymers.",

HPCA and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) were added into polylactide (PLA) resin as an intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system to impart flame retardancy and dripping resistance to PLA. The flammability and thermal stability of IFR-PLA composites were investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94 vertical burning, cone calorimetry and thermogravometric analysis (TGA) tests. The results showed that the IFR system had both excellent flame retardant and anti-dripping abilities for PLA. The TGA curves suggested that HPCA has good ability of char formation and when combined with APP, would induce synergistic effect which could be clearly observed. This effect greatly promoted the char formation of IFR-PLA composites, hence improved the flame retardant property. Additionally, the structure and morphology of char residues were studied by XPS, FTIR and SEM.",

The flame retardance and burning behaviors of the composites were investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94), and Cone calorimeter test. The thermal properties and decomposition kinetics were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under N 2 atmosphere. Addition of HPA-2TBA-Al results in an increased LOI value, a UL-94 V-0 rating together with a decrease in both the values of PHRR and THR in Cone calorimetric analysis. Visual observations and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) after flame retardant tests confirmed the char-formation which acts as a fire barrier in condense phase. Analysis of cone calorimeter data indicates that gas phase flame retardant mechanism exists in the GFPA6/HPA-2TBA-Al system.",

        "abstract": "For polymer/liquid crystal polymer (LCP) blend systems, the in-situ fibrillation of LCP in polymer matrix can result in the self-reinforcement of polymer/LCP composites. How to control the microfibrillation of LCP in matrix is a key to enhance the mechanical properties of composites. In this paper, we investigated the transesterification-controlled compatibility and microfibrillation of phosphorus-containing thermotropic liquid crystalline polyester, poly(p-hydroxybenzoate-co-DOPO-hydroquinone ethylene terephthalate) (PHBDET) in the PC/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer blend (PC-ABS) during the melt processing. A standard mode and temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry (DSC and TMDSC) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance ( 13C NMR) were used to investigate the transesterification and compatibility of PHBDET with PC-ABS. Microstructures, rheological and mechanical properties of the composites were also studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic rheological measurement and universal material testing machine. The results showed that the extent of transesterification could influence the compatibility of PHBDET with PC-ABS, and could be controlled by processing temperature and time. The improved compatibility was not always favorable for the microfibrillation of PHBDET in PC-ABS, but a certain extent of transesterification showed a positive influence on the tensile properties of the composites. Therefore, there existed an optimal extent of transesterification, in which the composite could show a good balance of compatibility and tensile properties. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

PET- co -DDP is a flame-retardant copolyester containing phosphorous linked pendent groups. O-MMT was obtained by modifying MMT with octadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (1831) through cation exchange. The structure of the nanocomposite was characterized by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The thermal oxidative degradation behaviour of PET- co -DDP/O-MMT nanocomposites was investigated via thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The thermal oxidative degradation activation energies of the PET- co -DDP/O-MMT nanocomposites were determined using Kissinger, Flynn\u2013Wall\u2013Ozawa and Friedman methods, and were compared with those of PET- co -DDP copolyester. The results showed that adding MMT to PET- co -DDP increased the decomposition activation energy and the residues of the PET- co -DDP at high temperatures, showing the higher thermal stability of the nanocomposites.",

        "abstract": "Polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one was carried out more detailed with immobilized lipase CA as the catalyst. The effect of the enzyme amount, reaction temperature and water content on polymerization was investigated, respectively. Both the conversion of monomer and the M v of poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) increased with the increase of enzyme amount, and maximized at 80 \u00b0C. At the beginning of polymerization, water molecules act as initiators. As the reaction time increased, linear condensation had gradually became dominant and water was released into the reaction system. Excess water may act as a chain cleavage agent. To obtain poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) with an ideal molecular weight, polymerization of 1,4-dioxan-2-one was conducted by adding solvent and MS to reaction system, and product with a higher molecular weight ( M v = 58,000) was gained. Keywords Enzymatic polymerization Poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) Immobilized lipase CA 1 Introduction As an aliphatic polyester with excellent biodegradability, bioabsorbability, biocompatibility, and flexibility, poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) (PPDO) has attracted great concern of researches in recent years. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used as surgical suture material [1] . In addition, PPDO can be applied to bone and tissue fixation and drug delivery system [2\u20138] . PPDO was synthesized extensively by chemical polymerization with organic metallic catalysts such as organic-tin [6,9] , organic-aluminum [10,11] , organic-zinc [12] , organic rare earth compounds [13] , etc. As its usage is focused mainly on pharmacological and surgical applications, the metallic catalysts should be removed before use. The purification process will increase the cost of PPDO. To suppress the harmful effects of metallic residues in PPDO for medical applications, some nontoxic catalysts were investigated, and enzymes were the expected catalysts for preparing harmless PPDO. The reported routes for lipase-catalyzed polymerization are shown in Scheme 1 [14] . There were many reports on the enzymatic synthesis of lactones [15\u201321] . However, only one study on the enzymatic synthesis of PPDO has been illustrated [14] . Nishida et al. reported that immobilized lipase CA for the bulk polymerization of PDO showed higher polymerization activity than other enzymes. Both the conversion and M w of PPDO increased with increasing enzyme loading amount. The water component acts not only as a substrate of the initiation process but also as a chain cleavage agent. However, there were still some questions, such as: how does reaction temperature influence polymerization, how does water content change during the enzymatic reaction and what is the relationship of water content change, monomer conversion and M w of PPDO? So, it is necessary that investigation on the enzymatic synthesis of PPDO was performed in more detail. In this paper, we further studied polymerization of PDO catalyzed by immobilized lipase CA. Moreover, a strategy for increasing molecular weight of PPDO was introduced. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Immobilized lipases CA (Novozym 435) with specific activity 10,000 PLU/g, derived from Candida antarctica, were purchased from Novo Nordisk Bioindustrials, Inc. in China. The enzymes were dried in vacuo at 25 \u00b0C for 1 day before use. 1,4-dioxan-2-one (PDO), a gift from the Pilot Plant of Center for Degradable and Flame-Retardant Polymeric Materials (Chengdu, China), was dried over CaH 2 for 48 h, distilled under reduced pressure, stored under nitrogen, and twice distilled in vacuo immediately before use. Other solvents were purchased from Hehong Chemical Factory (Chengdu, China). 2.2 Synthesis of PPDO The polymerization was carried out in bulk. Prescribed amounts monomer and immobilized lipases CA were mixed in a dry vial and sealed. All procedures were carried out in an atmosphere of highly purified nitrogen. The reactor was immersed into a temperature-adjusted oil bath with magnetic stirring for predetermined intervals. The reaction mixture was dissolved in chloroform and then the enzyme was separated by filtration. One fraction of the organic phase was used to measure the conversion of monomer by gas chromatography (GC). The other fraction was added cool methanol. The cloudy methanolic solution was centrifuged (3000 rpm, 30 min). The white precipitate was placed under vacuum to remove methanol and the dry polymer was prepared for 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and IR spectroscopy. 2.3 Determination of PPDO structure The structure of PPDO was determined by NMR and IR spectroscopy. The 1 H NMR spectra and 13 C NMR were recorded in CDCl 3 on a Varian Germini 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The spectra were obtained with a pulse angle of 25\u00b0, a delay time of 10 s, and an acquisition time of 2 s. All chemical shifts were reported in parts per million with tetramethylsilane as a reference. The infrared absorption spectra were performed on a Nicolet FTIR 170SX infrared spectrometer using KBr wafer. 2.4 Determination of PPDO molecular weight As the conventional solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene used in GPC measurements cannot resolve the resulting polymers with higher molecular weights, only the viscosity\u2013average molecular weights of the resulting polymers were measured in phenol/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (2:3 w/w) solution using an Ubbelohde viscosimeter thermostated at 25 \u00b0C. The molecular weights of PPDO can be calculated from the intrinsic viscosity [ \u03b7 ] according to Mark\u2013Houwink equation [ \u03b7 ] = KM v \u03b1 , where \u03b1 = 0.63 and K = 79 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm 3 g \u22121 [22] . 2.5 Determination of monomer conversion The monomer conversion was determined with a Shimadzu GC14-B GC equipped with an OE-54 capillary column (Altech, 0.25 mm \u00d7 30 m), hydrogen flame ionization detector, and CR-6A CHROMATOPAC. The injection volume was 1.0 mL. The pressures of nitrogen gas, hydrogen gas, and air were 600, 70, and 50 kPa, respectively. The temperature of the injection pool and detector were 250 \u00b0C. Upon injection, the column oven was held at 180 \u00b0C for 3 min and programmed to rise at 10 \u00b0C/min to a final temperature of 210 \u00b0C which was maintained for 2 min. The calibration curve was made with the monomer. 2.6 Measurement of water content in reaction system The total reaction water content was determined with a 831 KF Coulometer (Metrohm Ltd. CH-9101 Herisau Switzerland), in which 0.10 g of reaction mixture was dissolved in 3.0 mL 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. The water content of the supernatant was measured with a Karl Fischer titrator relative to a 3.0-mL 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane control. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterization The 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 , d, ppm) spectrum of the product showed the three characteristic signals: 4.16, 3.79, and 4.35. The 13 C NMR (CDCl 3 , d, ppm) spectrum of the product also showed the characteristic signals: 170.0, 69.2, 68.3, and 63.9. These data was in accord with published result [1,22,23] . The IR spectrum of PPDO had the characteristic absorption at 3445, 2960, 2926, 1745, 1434, 1386, 1203, 1130, and 1060 cm \u22121 . The broad absorption band at 3445 cm \u22121 is attributed to the vibrations of \u03bd O\u2013H of hydroxyl group. The two bands at 2960 and 2926 cm \u22121 are the characteristic absorption peaks of \u03bd C\u2013H . The band at 1745 cm \u22121 is ascribed to \u03bd C O of carbonate group. The band at 1434 cm \u22121 is \u03b4 C\u2013H of methylene group. The bands at 1203, 1130 and 1060 cm \u22121 are the characteristic absorption peaks of \u03bd C\u2013O . 3.2 Effect of the enzyme amount on polymerization Experiments were conducted with immobilized lipases CA of different weight percentage based on the PDO monomer (5.0 g). The polymerizations were carried out in bulk at 60 \u00b0C for 15 h. As shown in Fig. 1 , the conversion of monomer, the yield and the M v of PPDO increased with increasing immobilized lipases CA amount. However, the addition of immobilized lipases CA more than 10 wt.% based on 5.0 g PDO led to slight increasing of these values. So, the following experiments were conducted with 10 wt.% of immobilized lipases CA. In the polymerization without the enzyme (control experiment), the monomer was found unreacted, suggesting that the polymerization proceeded through the lipase catalysis. 3.3 Effect of reaction temperature on polymerization Reaction temperature is one of important factors for enzymatic polymerization because it not only influences reaction rate but enzyme activity. In this research, we investigated the effects of reaction temperature on polymerization. The polymerizations were conducted at temperatures from 40 to 120 \u00b0C for 15 h. The results were shown in Fig. 2 . Both the conversion of PDO and M v of PPDO maximized at 80 \u00b0C. The conversion and M v at more than 80 \u00b0C decreased considerably, which was probably due to activity lowering of lipase CA with reaction temperature rising. 3.4 Effect of water content on polymerization The activity of enzymes in non-aqueous media depends greatly on the water content of the reaction system. Gutman et al. believed water molecules surrounding the enzyme play an important role in maintaining the enzyme's conformational flexibility [24] . Bisht et al. proposed a mechanism for TMC polymerization with lipase CA in which water may act as a substrate in the initiation process [25] . Huan et al. found that water plays a different role during polymerization, in which the water is consumed at the initial stage and produced at later stage by linear condensation [26] . Matthijs et al. suggested that water dominates the initial initiation process of enzymatic polymerization [27] . Further more, Matthijs et al. found that the method of enzyme drying can have a significant effect on the results of enzymatic ring opening polymerization [28] . In order to investigate the effects of water on the enzymatic polymerization of PDO, the reactions were firstly carried out at 80 \u00b0C with water content in monomer in a range of 62.3\u2013441.8 ppm by the addition of water during the beginning of enzymatic polymerization. Since all the immobilized lipases CA (Novozym 435) were dried in vacuo at 25 \u00b0C for 1 day before use in our experiments, we only consider the effects of water in monomer on the enzymatic polymerization. As shown in Fig. 3 , the monomer conversion increased with increasing of water content in monomer during the initial stages of the reaction. However, the M v of PPDO maximized with the water content at 152.8 ppm. Huan et al. believed that at low water content, the enzyme conformation was relatively rigid, and that in non-aqueous media, this rigidity decreased the enzyme activity and therefore the chain initiation rate as well [26] . On the other hand, although high monomer conversion was achieved at high water content (indicating an increase in chain initiation rate and thus an increase in the number of propagation chains), excess water also led to the hydrolysis of polymer, resulting in lower molecular weight of polymer. So, the 152.8 ppm system produced higher molecular weight of PPDO than others. To investigate the effects of water content on the M v and monomer conversion for the entire enzymatic polymerization process, bulk polymerization of PPDO was performed at 80 \u00b0C with water content at 152.8 ppm for the initial reaction. As shown in Fig. 4 , M v increased slowly to 2800 (g L \u22121 ) during the first 4 h, and then increased steadily during 4\u201320 h. The PDO was completely consumed by 20 h. After 20 h, M v continued to increase, which indicated that linear condensation reactions had become important in chain propagation at this stage. The water content decreased from 152.8 to 62.8 ppm by 12 h, and then increased to 90.3 ppm by 28 h. These results suggested that: at the beginning of polymerization, water molecules participate in the chain initiation. As the reaction time increased, linear condensation had gradually became dominant and water is released into the reaction system. 3.5 Methods for increasing the molecular weight The molecular weight is one of most important properties of polymers. The higher the molecular weight, the more stability the PPDO polymer exhibits during its thermal processing and storage. Furthermore, the most important result of increased PPDO molecular weight will be improved material mechanical properties. Therefore, obtaining high-molecular weight production is very important for degradable PPDO. In order to increase the molecular weight, some methods must be applied to regulate the water content in the reaction system and overcome the diffusion limitation stemming from the increase of viscosity during polymerization process [11] . In the present study, adding solvent and MS to reaction system was introduced. Both PDO and PPDO are soluble in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, moreover, the boiling point of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (146.2 \u00b0C) is higher than the polymerization temperature (80 \u00b0C). Hence, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane was choose as solvent. According to the preceding experiments, the M v values of the polymer stop changing after 28 h of bulk polymerization. To increase the molecular weight, 4.0 g of the above reaction mixture and 10.0 mL of dry solvent were mixed, with and without 4 \u00c5 MS. Both reaction mixtures were incubated with shaking at 80 \u00b0C until M w of polymer did not increase. As shown in Table 1 , adding solvent and MS increased obviously the molecular weight of PPDO as we expected. However, adding the solvent resulted in an even greater increase than adding MS, which indicated that the diffusion limitation may be the major factor determining the increase of molecular weight in bulk polymerization. 4 Conclusion In this article, the enzymatic synthesis of PPDO was performed in more detail. Effects of the loading amount of enzyme, reaction temperature and water content on polymerization were investigated. Both the conversion of monomer and the M v of PPDO increased with increasing enzyme loading amount, and maximized at 80 \u00b0C. At the beginning of polymerization, water molecules act as initiators. As the reaction time increased, linear condensation had gradually became dominant and water is released into the reaction system. Excess water may act as a chain cleavage agent. Furthermore, adding solvent and MS to reaction system was conducted to increase the molecular weight of PPDO, and PPDO with a higher molecular weight ( M v = 58,000) was obtained.

        "abstract": "The synergistic effect of phosphorus oxynitride (PON) with a novolac-based char former modified by salification (NA-metal salt) on the flame retardance of polyamide 6 (PA6) was investigated. For this purpose, various flame-retardant PA6 systems were melt-compounded with PON, PON/NA, PON/NA-V 2O 5 and PON/NA-Fe 2O 3, and their flame retardance was evaluated by measuring the limiting oxygen index (LOI) values and UL-94 vertical burning ratings. The results showed that, compared with the PA6/PON/NA system, the combination of two char formers (NA-V 2O 5, NA-Fe 2O 3) with PON could obviously improve the char formation and flame retardance of PA6. The flame retardance and cone calorimetric analyses showed the stronger synergism as well as the better flame retardant performance of PON/NA-Fe 2O 3 flame retardant system. The effects of different char formers on the flame retardance and thermal stability of this system were also discussed. \u00a9 2012 Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, CAS Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "Prepolymers of both poly( p -dioxanone) (PPDO) and poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) reacted in the presence of toluene-2,4-di-iso-cyanate(TDI) as a chain extender to produce higher-molecular-weight chain-extended products (PPDOBS) in suitable reaction conditions. The novel biodegradable polymers were characterized by NMR, DSC, TG and WAXD. The results of thermal oxidative degradation show that chain-extended products have better thermal stability than PPDO. The thermal degradation of PPDOBS shows two stages, the first due to the degradation of PPDO segment of PPDOBS, and the second to the degradation of PBS segment. DSC measurement shows that the PPDOBS has only one T g , which means that PPDO has good compatibility with PBS. PPDOBS has two crystalline peaks during the cooling scan, but no crystalline peak during the heating scan. The diffraction peaks of PPDOBS appear at the same 2 \u03b8 angles as that of homopolymers, suggesting that the PPDO and PBS of the chain-extended products preserve their own crystal form. This kind of novel biodegradable polymer is expected to have potential applications in environmentally friendly materials.",

Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM) observations show that the char from PET/P-TLCP is more compact, therefore more efficiently resists fire and heat attack than pure PET. Moreover, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of evolved gas, indicate that P-TLCP decomposes to produce phosphorus-containing small molecular compounds during the pyrolysis process, such that P-TLCP could play a flame retardant role in vapour phase. Furthermore, P-TLCP strongly inhibits the generation of combustible compounds in the pyrolysis of PET, which also helps to resist fire propagation.",

        "abstract": "A novel phosphorus-containing compound, poly(2-hydroxy propylene spirocyclic pentaerythritol bisphosphonate) (PPPBP) has been proved to be an excellent flame retardant for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabrics. In order to understand its flame retardant mode, FT-IR and XPS are used to investigate the char-forming mechanism of PPPBP. FT-IR spectra results show that with the increase of temperature, P\u2013O\u2013C group of PPPBP breaks down gradually, and species containing C C double bond appear. XPS spectra indicate that PPPBP produces phosphoric or polyphosphoric acid during thermo-decomposition. In the high temperature range (>400 \u00b0C), C C and phosphorus-containing complexes become the major components of the charred residue of PPPBP. Data of XPS and FT-IR spectra give positive evidence that PPPBP yields high amount of carbonaceous chars by producing phosphoric or polyphosphoric acid, which inhibit the oxidation of carbon atoms, and simultaneously impel the formation of carbon and species containing carbon double bond with outstanding heat resistance. Keywords Flame retardant Char-forming mechanism Poly(2-hydroxy propylene spirocyclic pentaerythritol bisphosphonate) FT-IR XPS 1 Introduction Flame retardation design that targets at reducing the flammability of the polymeric materials has taken environmental issues into account to an unprecedented level. Accordingly, to develop non-halogenated flame-retardant system becomes an attractive and emergent subject [1\u20137] . Among non-halogenated flame retardants, phosphorus-based intumescent flame retardants (IFR) with particular char-yielding property have been widely used in various polymeric materials, such as polyethylene and polypropylene. One characteristic of IFR systems is its formation of insulative foamed carbonaceous chars [8] . It is reported that the char acts as a barrier between fire and polymers, and results in the extinguishment of combustion; thereby the flame retardancy of the underlying polymers is improved. Therefore, the coating becomes an interesting subject in literature [9\u201313] . In our previous study [14] , a novel char-forming polymeric flame retardant, poly(2-hydroxy propylene spirocyclic pentaerythritol bisphosphonate) (PPPBP) ( Scheme 1 ) was synthesized and applied in pure poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabrics through tropical treatment. Results show that its char-forming behaviour is intimately related to the improved flame retardance and dripping tendency of PET fabrics. Mechanism of flame retardant (PPPBP) is simply shown in Scheme\u00a02 . According to our research, PPPBP, a polyphosphate with both the char-forming agent and carbonization catalyst has outstanding efficiency in char yield as indicated in its TGA curve in air. It is shown that in the temperature range from 150 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C, two weight loss steps occur, which may be the formation process for the residual char [15] . The large amount of carbonaceous chars produced by PPPBP in drastic decomposition offer outstanding shielding protection for the underlying PET component, thereby retarding the decomposition rate of the PET fabrics treated PPPBP. The chemical and physical properties of the swollen structure of the residual char are the critical factors for the flame retardant effect of PPPBP. In this work, we investigate the char-forming mechanism by monitoring the thermo-oxidation process of PPPBP by analyzing chemical composition of its residue at various characteristic temperatures. X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the atomic concentration of C, O and P, and their respective electron binding energy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to monitor decomposition products in condensed state of the heat-treated PPPBP in air. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of samples Synthesis of PPPBP was based on our previous research [14] . Samples of heat-treated PPPBP were obtained after PPPBP was heated under air atmosphere for 10 min at 200 \u00b0C, 250 \u00b0C, 300 \u00b0C and 400 \u00b0C, respectively. Chemical composition of the residual char of PPPBP was investigated using FT-IR and XPS. 2.2 Measurement FT-IR spectra were measured on a Pekin Elmer FT-IR 16PC model, using KBr pellet technique. XPS spectra were recorded by a XSAM80, using Al K\u03b1 excitation radiation ( hv = 1486.6 eV), and calibrated by assuming the electron binding energy of carbonaceous carbon to be 284.6 eV. The pressure in the analyzer was kept at about 6.7 \u00d7 10 \u22127 Pa. XPS data were processed by DS 300 data system. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XPS Figs. 1\u20133 show O 1s , C 1s , and P 2p spectra of the heat-treated PPPBP in air. Tables 1\u20133 show the specific XPS data of the spectra. As shown in Fig.\u00a02 , O 1s spectra in the temperature range from 200 \u00b0C to 300 \u00b0C show two bands. The binding energies for the two bands are about 532 eV and 533 eV, respectively, as shown in Table 1 . The band centered at around 532 eV can be assigned to O-group of phosphate or carbonyl groups [16] , while the band around 533 eV can be assigned to \u2013O-group in the form of C\u2013O\u2013C, P\u2013O\u2013P and C\u2013O\u2013P groups [17,18] that exist in molecular structures of PPPBP and its decomposition products. Based on our previous study [14] , the C 1s spectrum of PPPBP at room temperature shows two bands with binding energies of 284.8 eV and 286.6 eV. In C 1s spectra of the heat-treated PPPBP at temperature lower than 400 \u00b0C as shown in Fig.\u00a02 , three bands are presented with binding energies around 284 eV, 286 eV and 287 eV. The band around 284 eV is contributed by C\u2013H and C\u2013C bonds in aliphatic and aromatic species, the thermo-decomposition products of PPPBP [19] . The band centered at around 286 eV can be assigned to C\u2013O and C\u2013O\u2013P groups [20] . The appearance of the band at 287 eV is the contribution of C O group [21] . However, only the band at about 284 eV is observed in spectra at 400 \u00b0C. These facts show that C\u2013O, C\u2013O\u2013P and C O groups disappear at a temperature higher than 400 \u00b0C. Fig.\u00a03 shows the P 2p XPS spectra of PPPBP after heat treatment. Only one band is observed in the P 2p XPS spectra (>200 \u00b0C). In contrast to that of PPPBP at room temperature, the binding energies of heat-treated PPPBP downfield from 134.6 eV (P\u2013O\u2013C) [22] to around 135 eV, which can be assigned to P O group in phosphate species (e.g. P O phosphoric acid or polyphosphoric acid) or inorganic phosphorus-containing species (e.g. P 2 O 5 ) [23] . 3.1.1 O 1s spectra Fig.\u00a04 shows the dynamic change of the ratio of \u2013O to O of the heat-treated PPPBP as temperature increases. The ratio is calculated from the area of the bands of O 1s spectra as shown in Table 1 . The ratio remains stable from 200 \u00b0C to 250 \u00b0C, and then decreases continuously at a temperature higher than 250 \u00b0C. The appearance of the stable stage could be explained by the simultaneous effects of the breakdown of P\u2013O\u2013C group and the formation of P\u2013OH group. At\u00a0higher temperatures (>250 \u00b0C), the decomposition rate of P\u2013O\u2013C group speeds up [24] . Besides, C\u2013O and C\u2013C bonds may be transformed into C O containing species in condensed state by oxidation. Therefore, a descent slope from 250 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C is observed. 3.1.2 C 1s spectra Fig.\u00a05 shows the plot of Co/Ca (C(o), i.e. oxidized carbon atoms; C(a), i.e. carbon atoms in aliphatic or aromatic species.) versus temperature ranging from 200 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C. In contrast to the atom concentration ratio of \u2013O/ O, that of Co/Ca increases in the temperature range from 200 \u00b0C to 250 \u00b0C, and then decreases at above 250 \u00b0C. The initial decrease of the ratio is contributed by the oxidization of C\u2013H and C\u2013C groups, resulting in the increase of C O groups. During the course, the C\u2013C groups may be transformed into species containing C C as indicated by the existence of the band centered at about 284 eV in C 1s spectra. At above 250 \u00b0C, species containing C O would be further oxidized to form CO and CO 2 [19] . Accordingly, the relative content of species containing C C increases, thereby resulting in the increase of the ratio of \u2013O/ O. 3.2 FT-IR spectra Fig.\u00a06 shows the FT-IR spectra of PPPBP before and after heat treatment. In the spectra of PPPBP before treatment, the strong and broad absorbing peak at 3500\u20133000 cm \u22121 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of O\u2013H bond. Peaks at 2940 cm \u22121 and 1515 cm \u22121 are the contribution of the stretching and bending vibrations of C\u2013H bond [24] . The absorbing peak of P O bond appears at 1305 cm \u22121 . Two strong peaks at 1034 cm \u22121 and 980 cm \u22121 , respectively, can be assigned to the stretching vibration of P\u2013O bond of the P\u2013O\u2013C group, while the stretching vibration of C\u2013O bond of the group is shown up at 823 cm \u22121 [25] . In contrast to the FT-IR spectrum of PPPBP before heat treatment, those of the treated change significantly as temperature increases. In the temperature range from 200 \u00b0C to 300 \u00b0C, the absorbance of the characteristic peaks varies and some new peaks appear. However, in the TGA curve of PPPBP in air, there is no obvious weight loss in this temperature range. This phenomenon implies that thermo-decomposition mainly occurs in condensed state during the course. The absorbance of C\u2013H bond at 2940 cm \u22121 and 1515 cm \u22121 weakens. Two new peaks at 1730 cm \u22121 and 1650 cm \u22121 appear at 200 \u00b0C, indicating the existence of species containing C O and C C [26] . The absorbance of the former peak increases continuously even until 400 \u00b0C, while that of the latter decreases from 250 \u00b0C and finally disappear at above 400 \u00b0C. These changes combined with those of the Co/Ca ratio confirm that the oxidation of PPPBP produces C O group, which is further oxidized into CO and CO 2 , and species containing C C with good heat resistance [27] become the major component at high temperature (>400 \u00b0C). The oxidation of C O group and release of CO and CO 2 give rise to the weight loss stage between 350 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C as shown in TGA curve of PPPBP. The characteristic peaks assigned to O P\u2013O\u2013C group (P O 1305 cm \u22121 , P\u2013O\u2013C 1034 cm \u22121 and 823 cm \u22121 ) weaken, indicating the gradual degradation of the group in the range from 200 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C. Accordingly, the peak at 1515 cm \u22121 , which is assigned to C\u2013O group, decreases and completely disappears at 300 \u00b0C. The peak assigned to P\u2013OH group shows up as a broad band from 3300\u20132500 cm \u22121 [25] and its intensity increases in the above range. At 400 \u00b0C, while the peak of C O bond disappears, that of C C bond becomes a strong one. These facts are in good agreement with those of C 1s XPS spectrum at 400 \u00b0C. This spectrum also shows that P\u2013O\u2013C group breaks down totally. In the corresponding FT-IR spectrum at this temperature, the peaks assigned to the group disappear. Besides, P\u2013O\u2013P containing species exists as indicated by the appearance of the peak at 1000 cm \u22121 , and the disappearance of two peaks (1034 cm \u22121 and 823 cm \u22121 ) assigned to P\u2013O\u2013C group. Simultaneously, a new peak appears at 1180 cm \u22121 , which is the contribution of the vibration of P O bond of O P\u2013O\u2013P O [25] . From the alteration of FT-IR spectra of PPPBP in the temperature range from 200 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C, the char-forming process can be proposed as follows: although initially drastic oxidation is greatly suppressed at above 250 \u00b0C for the appearance of phosphoric and polyphosphoric acid. Oxidation and carbonization are the two competing reactions during the course. Phosphoric and polyphosphoric acids impel the reorganization of carbon atoms into complexes containing C C bond, such as aromatic species; thereby indirectly reducing the oxidation of C\u2013H and C\u2013C groups of PPPBP, producing the charred residue of species containing C C bond at above 400 \u00b0C. According to the results of XPS and FT-IR spectra, a possible char-forming mechanism of PPPBP is shown in Scheme 2 . 4 Conclusion 1. XPS spectra of C, O and P show that oxidized carbon-containing species initially increase, then decrease subsequently during the thermo-decomposition process of PPPBP, while C C bond containing species with good heat resistance gradually becomes the major component of the charred residue. 2. FT-IR spectra of heat-treated PPPBP confirm that polyphosphoric of phosphoric acids promote the formation unsaturated carbonaceous species and simultaneously suppress the oxidation of carbons. Thereby, PPPBP produces high yield of phosphorus\u2013carbon complexes in solid state.

In addition, it showed good effect on the fixation of evolved HCl and greatly decreased the chlorine content in the oil.

The results indicate that besides the enhancement in flame retardance, dripping resistance of the treated PET fabrics is imparted.

The compressive modulus of an aerogel prepared from an aqueous suspension containing 2 wt% PVOH/8 wt% clay increased 29-fold upon crosslinking, for example. Crosslinking of the polymer/clay aerogels decreased the onset decomposition temperature as measured by thermogravimetric analysis, and generated a more continuous structure at higher clay contents.

The changes of intrinsic viscosity, mechanical properties, crystallinity, surface morphologies, and microstructure of PPDO and PPDO containing stabaxol?-1 for 6 weeks are monitored. With increasing the degradation time, the intrinsic viscosity and mechanical properties of PPDO decrease much faster than those of PPDO containing 0.6 wt % stabaxol ?-1. During the degradation, PPDO containing 0.6 wt % stabaxol?-1 shows a better physical integrity than PPDO. It has been shown that stabaxol?-1 can retard the hydrolysis degradation of PPDO and enhance its hydrolytic stability. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 2014, 131, 40026.

Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), solid state (31)P and (27)Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray diffraction, and element analysis were used to investigate the chemical structure of the hybrids, where the microrod-like core was confirmed as Al-PPi aggregates generated from the reaction between BM and PPiA, and those irregular nanoparticles in the shell belonged to residual BM. Compared with the traditional dissolution-precipitation process, a novel analogous suspension reaction mode was proposed to explain the hybridization process and the resulting product. Scanning electronic microscopy further proved the core-shell structure of the hybrids. BM exhibited much higher initial decomposition temperature than that of Al-PPi; therefore, the hybrid showed better thermal stability than Al-PPi, and it met the processing temperature of semi-aromatic polyamide (HTN, for instance) as an additive-type flame retardant. Limiting oxygen index and cone calorimetric analysis suggested the excellent flame-retardant performance and smoke suppressing activity by adding the resulting hybrid into HTN.",

        "abstract": "Biocomposite of wood flour (WF)/polypropylene (PP) composite (WPC) is not easily flame-retarded because of the different flame retardant mechanisms of PP and WF. In order to improve the flame retardancy of WPC, a single flame retardant of ammonium polyphosphate (APP) modified via ion exchange reaction with ethanolamine, which is named as ETA-APP, was used to prepare flame-retardant WPC. The flammability was investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94 vertical burning test, and cone calorimeter. The results show the flame retardant properties of the flame-retardant WPC are improved greatly. The limiting oxygen index is 43.0%, which is increased by 71.6% compared with that of WPC with the same content of APP. And the vertical burning test can pass UL-94 V-0 rating. The results of cone calorimeter test show that the heat release rate (HRR) and total heat release (THR) of the WPC with ETA-APP are decreased in comparison with WPC/APP. The flame-retardant mechanism of WPC/ETA-APP system was investigated ...",

        "abstract": "To improve the flame-retardant efficiency and water resistance of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), the UV-curable pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) was used to microencapsulate APP  the UV curing polymerization method. The prepared PETA-microencapsulated APP (PETA-APP) was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. PETA-APP was used as intumescent flame retardant (IFR) alone to flame retard polypropylene (PP). The water resistance of PP/PETA-APP composites was investigated, and the effect of PETA on the combustion behaviors of PP/APP composites was studied through limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94) and cone calorimeter (CC) test, respectively. With 40 wt% of PETA-APP, the PP/PETA-APP system could achieve a LOI value of 30.0% and UL-94 V-0 rating after treatment in hot water for 168 h, while the LOI value of the system containing 40 wt% uncoated APP was only 19.2%, and it failed to pass the UL-94 rating. CC test results showed that the heat release rate (HRR), mass loss rate (MLR) and smoke production rate (SPR) of PP/PETA-APP system decreased significantly compared with PP/APP system, especially the peak of HRR was decreased by 51.4%. The mechanism for the improvement of flame reatardancy for PP/PETA-APP composites was discussed based on FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests. All these results illustrated that simultaneous improvement of flame retardancy and water resistance for PP/APP was achieved through coating UV-curable PETA onto APP.",

        "abstract": "Polyvinyl alcohol)-graft-lactic acid (PVA-g-LA) was synthesized by melt polycondensation of PVA and lactic acid using stannous chloride as a catalyst. The molecular structure of the copolymer was characterized by 1H NMR. The thermal properties of PVA-g-LA were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that the PVA-g-LA copolymer exhibited lower glass transition temperature (T g) and melting temperature (T m) and higher decomposition temperature (T d) than pure PVA, and a difference of 60-80 \u00b0C between T m and T d could be obtained, suggesting that the introduction of the oligo-poly(lactic acid) grafted chains can give rise to the melting flow processing of PVA. PVA-g-LA films prepared by compression molding at 140-150\u00b0C had good flexibility and elasticity as well as water resistance. The copolymers have a potential application in food packaging. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

The loading amount of Ag-NPs was affected by the concentrations of Ag+ and trisodium citrate, and their optimum concentrations were found to be 0.014 and 0.030\u00a0g/ml. The Ag-NP-loaded fibers presented a prolonged Ag release behavior in aqueous solution, of which the cumulative release was less than 5\u00a0% within 48\u00a0h. In addition, the viscose fibers showed good antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, and their consecutive antimicrobial activity was kept at more than 90\u00a0% after several washing cycles. Modified viscose fibers, therefore, offer a great opportunity for use as antimicrobial fabrics.",

With the increase of both the amount of acetate ionic liquid and the reaction temperature, the degradation degree of PLA increases. The structure of ionic liquids affects the degradation behavior of PLA: for cations, the proton from the C-2 position on the imidazolium ring is involved in the degradation of PLA; the degradation of PLA increases with the increase of the alkyl side-chain length of imidazolium cations; for anions, moderate basicity of the acetate ion contributes to the high activity of the imidazolium acetate ionic liquids in the degradation of PLA.",

Abstract Reaction of MX 3 (M = Al, Ga, In; X = Br, Cl) with RLi (R = 2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 ) affords RGaCl 2 \u00b7 OEt 2 , 1 , RAlBr 2 \u00b7 OEt 2 , 2 , R 2 GaCl, 3 , and R 3 In, 4 . These sterically demanding compounds have been characterized by elemental analyses, 1 H NMR spectroscopy, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The geometry about the metal centers in 1 and 2 is best described as distorted tetrahedral while the coordination about the gallium atom in 3 is distorted trigonal planar. Compound 4 , with the indium atom in a trigonal planar environment, is noteworthy as the first example of a tris( m -terphenyl)group 13 metal compound. The propeller arrangement of the three ligands in compound 4 serves to virtually encapsulate the metallic center. Keywords Aluminum Gallium Group 13 Indium Terphenyl ligand 1 Introduction Sterically demanding ligands have played a prominent role in the development of group 13 organometallic chemistry. In particular, m -terphenyl ligands have been extensively utilized to stabilize low-valent, low-coordinate, organometallic group 13 compounds [1\u20133] . That the structure and bonding of a given compound may be dramatically tuned as a function of ligand steric loading has been a practical method to afford interesting organometallic compounds with intriguing properties. This concept is elegantly illustrated by cyclogallenes, M 2 [GaR] 3 (M = Na [4] , K [5] ; R = 2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 ; Mes = 2,4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 ), metalloaromatic gallium ring systems [1,6] . Another notable example of this concept is the digallyne, Na 2 [RGa GaR] (R = 2,6-(2,4,6- i -Pr 3 C 6 H 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 ) [7] . The digallyne and cyclogallenes are typically prepared by alkali metal reduction of the respective RGaCl 2 (R = m -terphenyl) species. Surprisingly, efforts to evaluate the organometallic group 13 chemistry of less bulky m -terphenyl ligands have been limited. Herein, we report the syntheses and molecular structures of RGaCl 2 \u00b7 OEt 2 , 1 , RAlBr 2 \u00b7 OEt 2 , 2 , R 2 GaCl, 3 , and R 3 In, 4 (R = 2,6-di(4- t -butylphenyl)phenyl, 2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 ). The geometry about the metal centers in 1 and 2 is best described as distorted tetrahedral while the coordination about the gallium atom in 3 approaches distorted trigonal planar. Compound 4 , with the indium atom in a trigonal planar environment, is noteworthy as a rare example of a tris- m -terphenyl-group 13 metal compound. The propeller arrangement of the three ligands in 4 serves to effectively shield the indium center. 2 Results and discussion Investigation of the 2,6-di(4- t -butylphenyl)phenyl ligand was undertaken in an effort to gain further insight into the significance of substitution at the ortho position of the outer phenyl rings, or the lack thereof, when employing sterically encumbered m -terphenyl-based ligands [8] . It has been shown that this ligand has the tendency for facile intramolecular C\u2013H bond activation of the ortho position of the outer phenyl ring, which may serve as a mechanism to form an in situ generated bidentate ligand that provides robust steric protection for the metal center [9] . The literature reveals a paucity of reports of 2,6-di(4- t -butylphenyl)phenyl based group 13 compounds [10,11] . The reactivity of RLi (R = 2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 ) with group 13 metals was of interest, as to ascertain the stability and structural properties of the ligand\u2013metal complexes. Compounds 1 \u2013 4 were prepared by reaction of the appropriate group 13 halide with RLi ( Scheme 1 ). Although these compounds are all air- and moisture-sensitive, they are stable for months under an inert atmosphere. Single crystal X-ray analysis reveals that 1 is a monomeric 2,6-di(4- t -butylphenyl)phenylgallium chloride etherate with two independent molecules in one asymmetric unit ( Fig. 1 ). Compound 1 is the first single crystal X-ray structurally characterized m -terphenylgallium halide etherate, RGaX 2 \u00b7 OEt 2 . In general, halide-bridged dimers, [RGaCl 2 ] 2 [12] , are usually observed for ( m -terphenyl)gallium dihalides. Thus, the formation of 1 is notable. Previous structural reports of mono-ligated m -terphenylgallium halides are illustrated as neutral monomers without diethyl ether coordination, RGaCl 2 [13] , dimeric complexes, [RGaCl 2 ] 2 [13\u201315] , and anionic complexes, [RGaCl 3 ] \u2212 (R = m -terphenyl ligand) [16] . Although the synthesis of RGaCl 2 \u00b7 OEt 2 (R = 2,6-(2,4,6- i -Pr 3 C 6 H 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 ) was previously reported [13] , structural data was not presented. The Ga(1)\u2013O(1) distance in 1 , 2.041(4) \u00c5, is only slightly longer than that of (2,4,6- i -Pr 3 C 6 H 2 )GaCl 2 \u00b7 THF (2.011(4) \u00c5) [12] . The Ga(1)\u2013O(1) bond distance in 1 is longer than the Ga\u2013O bonds of 2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 -based/gallium compounds, R 2 GaOH (1.7833(17) \u00c5), [RGa(Cl)(\u03bc-OH)] 2 (1.938(2)\u20131.942(2) \u00c5), and [RGa(Me)(\u03bc-OH)] 2 (1.9110(9)\u20131.942(2) \u00c5) [17] , and exemplifies the weak diethyl ether coordination interaction with the metal in 1 . The C(1)\u2013Ga(1)\u2013O(1) bond angle, 105.89(15)\u00b0, is the largest bond angle of those involving the ether donor molecule in 1 and most closely fits with tetrahedral geometry. Notably, the O(1)\u2013Ga(1)\u2013Cl(2) bond angle, 95.05(11)\u00b0, is quite small, and although the O(1)\u2013Ga(1)\u2013Cl(1) bond angle, 101.47(11)\u00b0, is larger, it still deviates from the expected value. Inspection of the remaining bond angles in 1 reveals that the C(1)\u2013Ga(1)\u2013Cl(1) and C(1)\u2013Ga(1)\u2013Cl(2) bond angles, 123.49(12)\u00b0 and 118.72(13)\u00b0, respectively, are much larger than the Cl(1)\u2013Ga(1)\u2013Cl(2) bond angle, 106.70(6)\u00b0, which may be a consequence of steric repulsion between the ligand and chlorides. In fact, acute Cl\u2013Ga\u2013Cl bond angles are common among four coordinate m -terphenylgallium chloride complexes. The dimeric complex, [RGaCl 2 ] 2 (R = 2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 ), was shown to have Cl\u2013Ga\u2013Cl bond angles as small as 86.8(2)\u00b0 [14,15] . The Ga\u2013C bond distance in 1 of 1.985(5) \u00c5 compares well with other m -terphenylgallium chloride compounds, which range from 1.930(8) to 1.985(1) \u00c5 [13\u201315,18] , and similarly to those in (Me 5 C 6 ) 3 Ga, (mean bond distance of 1.981(5) \u00c5) [19] . The Ga\u2013Cl bond distances in 1 are unremarkable with a mean bond distance of 2.205 \u00c5. The structure of 2 ( Fig. 2 ) reveals a four-coordinate aluminum atom in a distorted tetrahedral environment. The C(1)\u2013Al(1)\u2013Br(1) and C(1)\u2013Al(1)\u2013Br(2) bond angles, 117.46(15)\u00b0 and 120.10(15)\u00b0, respectively, are significantly distorted from classical tetrahedral geometry and are closer to predicted trigonal planar angles. Conversely, the Br(1)\u2013Al(1)\u2013O(1) bond angle, 97.94(14)\u00b0, is much smaller than the anticipated 109.5\u00b0. An interesting feature of 2 can be seen along the Al\u2013C(1) vector, which is bent away from the phenyl ring plane by 15.54\u00b0(avg.). This distortion may be due to packing forces in the crystal lattice, a factor that allows flexibility in the ionic Al\u2013C bond [20] . Comparison of 2 with (2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 )AlH 2 (NMe 3 ), 5 , is warranted, as it is the only 2,6-di(4- t -butylphenyl)phenyl-aluminum compound [10] . The Al(1)\u2013C(1) bond distance in 2 , 1.979(5) \u00c5, is shorter than that in 5 (2.018(2) \u00c5), but compares well with the only other reported m -terphenyl stabilized aluminum bromide etherate, RAlBr 2 \u00b7 OEt 2 , (R = 2,4,6-Ph 3 C 6 H 2 ) (1.983(9) \u00c5) [20] , and the organoaluminum bromide dimer, [RAlBr 3 Li] 2 (R = 2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 ), 1.96(2) \u00c5 [21] . The structure of 2 shows that the Br(2) atom is almost orthogonal with respect of the central phenyl ring, and the two outer phenyl rings are tilted to it. The Al(1)\u2013Br(1) bond distance in 2 , 2.3175(17) \u00c5, is slightly longer than the Al(1)\u2013Br(2) bond, 2.3010(16) \u00c5, but both are similar to those in RAlBr 2 \u00b7 OEt 2 (R = 2,4,6-Ph 3 C 6 H 2 ), (2.297(3) and 2.302(3) \u00c5), but slightly shorter than those in [RAlBr 3 Li] 2 , (R = 2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 ), (mean 2.347 \u00c5) [21] . Compound 3 joins a small group of R 2 GaX compounds, (R = m -terphenyl, X = halide) [14,16,22] , although a series of analogous hydrides, alkyls, and a hydroxyl have been reported [17] . The gallium atom in 3 is three-coordinate in a distorted trigonal planar environment ( Fig. 3 ). Correspondingly, other R 2 GaX compounds (R = 2,6-Ph 2 C 6 H 3 ; X = I [16] , and R = 2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 ; X = Cl [22] , Br [14] ), all have distorted trigonal planar environments around the gallium metal center. The C\u2013Ga\u2013Br bond angles in (2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 ) 2 GaBr, are identical (101.8(2)\u00b0). Similarly, the chloride analogue has C\u2013Ga\u2013Cl bond angles of 103.2(4)\u00b0 and 103.4(4)\u00b0. However, the corresponding C(1)\u2013Ga(1)\u2013Cl(1) and C(27)\u2013Ga(1)\u2013Cl(1) bond angles in 3 , 106.69(9)\u00b0 and 115.76(9)\u00b0, respectively, are asymmetric. The C(1)\u2013Ga(1)\u2013C(27) bond angle of 3 , 137.37(12)\u00b0, is larger than the C(1)\u2013Ga(1)\u2013C(1a) bond angle (134.3(3)\u00b0) in (2,6-Ph 2 C 6 H 3 ) 2 GaI, but expectedly smaller than that of the \u201cT shaped\u201d (2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 ) 2 GaX (X = Cl, Br) compounds (153.5\u00b0). The Ga(1)\u2013C(1) and Ga(1)\u2013C(27) bond lengths in 3 , 1.981(3) and 1.997(3) \u00c5, respectively, compare well with other reported diarylgallium halides, while the Ga(1)\u2013Cl(1) bond length in 3 , 2.2537(10) \u00c5, is somewhat longer than that in (2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 ) 2 GaCl, 2.177(5) \u00c5. With the growing utility of triorganoindium compounds for fundamental organic transformations such as conjugate addition [23] , cross-coupling [24\u201326] , and allylic substitution reactions [27,28] , and the ubiquitous use of m -terphenyl ligands in organometallic-group 13 chemistry, it is noteworthy that there are no reports of tris( m -terphenyl)indium compounds. Compound 4 , the first tris( m -terphenyl)group 13 compound, is noteworthy. The formation of 4 from reaction of RLi and InCl 3 in a 1:1 ratio is interesting. The poor solubility of InCl 3 may have been a factor in the preparation of 4 . The sharp melting point and accurate elemental analysis is indicative of 4 being the sole product. Consideration of the X-ray structure of 4 provides an interesting contrast from the organo/group 13 halides discussed above ( Fig. 4 ). Compound 4 crystallizes as a monomer with one molecule of diethyl ether per asymmetric unit. The indium atom in 4 is in a distorted trigonal planar coordination environment with C\u2013In\u2013C angles of C(1)\u2013In(1)\u2013C(27), 114.77(13)\u00b0; C(1)\u2013In(1)\u2013C(53), 120.34(12)\u00b0; C(27)\u2013In(1)\u2013C(53), 124.83(13)\u00b0 and are similar to those in trimesitylindium, Mes 3 In [29] , and triphenylindium, Ph 3 In [30,31] . However, a twofold axis was observed for Ph 3 In that is not evident in 4 . The three ligands in 4 are arranged about the indium atom in a propeller like fashion and are not crystallographically equivalent due to differing dihedral angles with respect to the InC 3 -core plane. The dihedral planes were found to be 39.84\u00b0, 31.95\u00b0, and 65.37\u00b0 for the C(1), C(27) and C(53) central phenyl ring planes, respectively. The In\u2013C bonds in 4 (In(1)\u2013C(1), 2.200(3) \u00c5; In(1)\u2013C(27), 2.199(3) \u00c5; In(1)\u2013C(53), 2.193(3) \u00c5) are comparable to those in Mes 3 In (2.170(5) \u00c5; 2.170(5) \u00c5; 2.163(5) \u00c5), Ph 3 In (2.111(14) \u00c5; 2.155(14) \u00c5), and (2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 ) 2 InBr (2.171(25) \u00c5; 2.166(26) \u00c5) [32] . These values for 4 are comparable to those in [(2,6-Mes 2 C 6 H 3 )InCl 2 ] 2 (2.138(8) \u00c5) [33] and [(2,6-(2,4,6- i -Pr 3 C 6 H 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 )InCl 2 ] 2 (2.129(5) \u00c5) [15] . 3 Conclusion In summary, 2,6-di(4- t -butylphenyl)phenyl-based group 13 organometallic compounds, 1 \u2013 4 , have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, 1 H NMR spectroscopy, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 1 represents the first single crystal X-ray structurally characterized m -terphenylgallium dihalide etherate, while 4 represents the first reported tris( m -terphenyl)group 13 compound. 4 Experimental 4.1 General comments Standard Schlenk techniques were employed in conjunction with an inert-atmosphere drybox (MBraun Labmaster 130). Solvents were distilled under an argon atmosphere with sodium benzophenone. Argon was passed through copper-based purification and molecular sieve drying columns prior to use. Aluminum(III) bromide, gallium(III) chloride, indium(III) chloride, 4- tert -butylphenyl bromide, n -butyllithium, and 1,3-dichlorobenzene were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI) and used without further purification. 2,6-Di(4- tert -butylphenyl)iodobenzene, 2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 I [34] , and (2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 )Li [35] , were prepared according to the literature methods. Elemental analyses were performed by Complete Analysis Laboratories Inc. (Parsippany, NJ). 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury plus 400 MHz spectrometer. 4.2 Synthesis of (2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 )GaCl 2 \u00b7 OEt 2 ( 1 ) GaCl 3 (1.76 g, 10 mmol) in diethyl ether (25 mL) was rapidly transferred to a yellow slurry of (2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 )Li (3.47 g, 10 mmol) in diethyl ether (40 mL) at ca. \u221278 \u00b0C and allowed to slowly warm to r.t. After stirring for 48 h, a clear pale yellow solution was filtered from a white precipitate. All solvent was removed in vacuo and then the residue was extracted in hexane/diethyl ether (1:1, 20 mL) and placed at r.t. for 2 days, which resulted colorless, cubic crystals (2.13 g, 38% m.p. 212\u2013214 \u00b0C), Elemental Anal. Calc. (found) for C 30 H 39 Cl 2 GaO (556.26): C, 64.78 (64.67); H, 7.07 (6.94); 1 H NMR (THF-D 8 , 400 MHz) \u03b4 1.116 (q, 6H, \u2013OCH 2 C H 3 ); 1.360 (s, 18H, C(C H 3 ) 3 ); 3.385 (t, 4H, \u2013OC H 2 CH 3 ); 7.377\u20137.493 (m, 11H, Ar\u2013H). 4.3 Synthesis of (2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 )AlBr 2 \u00b7 OEt 2 ( 2 ) AlBr 3 (1.29 g, 4.8 mmol) in diethyl ether (30 mL) was rapidly transferred by cannula to a yellow slurry of (2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 )Li (1.69 g, 4.8 mmol) in diethyl ether (40 mL) at ca. \u221278 \u00b0C and allowed to warm slowly to r.t. After stirring for 72 h, a colorless solution with white precipitant was observed. The solution was filtered from precipitant and solvent reduced by a third and then placed in freezer at \u221220 \u00b0C. After 3 days a yellow viscous, oily residue formed. The colorless solution was filtered from the oil and then reduced by a third and placed at r.t. for 3 days which gave colorless, rectangular crystals (2.25 g, 78%; m.p. 196\u2013198 \u00b0C), Elemental Anal. Calc. (found) for C 30 H 39 AlBr 2 O (604.42): C, 59.81 (59.64); H, 6.53 (6.50); 1 H NMR (D 6 -benzene, 400 MHz) \u03b4 0.451 (t, 6H, \u2013OCH 2 C H 3 ), 1.236 (s, 18H, C(C H 3 ) 3 ), 3.219 (q, 4H, \u2013OC H 2 CH 3 ), 7.347\u20137.410 (m, 7H, Ar\u2013H), 7.866\u20137.887 (m, 4H, Ar\u2013H). 4.4 Synthesis of (2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 ) 2 GaCl ( 3 ) GaCl 3 (1.22 g, 6.95 mmol) in diethyl ether (25 mL) was rapidly transferred to a yellow slurry of (2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 )Li (4.85 g, 13.9 mmol) in diethyl ether (40 mL) at ca. \u221278 \u00b0C and allowed to slowly warm to r.t. After stirring for 12 h, a clear yellow solution with white precipitant was observed. The solution was filtered from the precipitant and solvent reduced by half. After 3 days at r.t. colorless, cubic crystals formed (2.35 g, 43%; m.p. 202\u2013204 \u00b0C), Elemental Anal. Calc. (found) for C 52 H 58 GaCl (788.19): C, 79.24 (79.06); H, 7.42 (7.61); 1 H NMR (THF-D 8 , 400 MHz) \u03b4 1.31 (s, 18H, C(C H 3 ) 3 ); 6.987\u20137.267 (m, 11H, Ar\u2013H). 4.5 Synthesis of (2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 ) 3 In ( 4 ) A yellow slurry of (2,6-(4- t -BuC 6 H 4 ) 2 C 6 H 3 )Li (1.69 g, 4.8 mmol) in diethyl ether (40 mL) was transferred by cannula to a slurry of InCl 3 (1.07 g, 4.8 mmol) in diethyl ether (30 mL) at ca. \u221278 \u00b0C. The reaction was allowed slowly warm to r.t. After 3 days of stirring, a clear, colorless solution with an appreciable amount of white precipitant was observed. The solution was filtered from precipitant and solvent reduced and placed in freezer at \u221220 \u00b0C. After 10 days, colorless, flat, rectangular crystals formed (0.21 g, 11.5%; m.p. 288\u2013290 \u00b0C), Elemental Anal. Calc. (found) for C 78 H 87 In (1139.34): C, 82.23 (82.51); H, 7.70 (7.76); 1 H NMR (D 6 -benzene, 400 MHz) \u03b4 1.218 (s, 18H, C(C H 3 ) 3 ), 6.972\u20137.227 (m, 11H, Ar\u2013H). 4.6 X-ray crystallographic study Colorless crystals of 1 \u2013 4 were mounted in glass capillaries under an atmosphere of argon in the drybox. The X-ray intensity data were collected at room temperature on a Bruker SMART TM CCD-based X-ray diffractometer system with graphite-monochromated Mo K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.710\u201373 \u00c5), using the \u03c9-scan technique. The structures were solved by direct methods using the shelxtl 6.1 bundled software package [36] . The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects and integrated with the manufacturer\u2019s saint software. Absorption corrections were applied with the sadabs . Non-hydrogen atomic scattering factors were taken from the literature tabulations [37] . The heavy atom positions were determined using direct methods employing the shelxtl routine methods. The remaining non-hydrogen atoms were located from successive difference Fourier map calculations. In the final cycles of each refinement hydrogen atom positions were calculated and allowed to ride on the carbon to which they are bonded assuming a C\u2013H bond length of 0.95 \u00c5. Hydrogen atom temperature factors were fixed at 1.10 times the isotropic temperature factor of the C-atom to which they are bonded. For compound 1 , the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically except for one carbon atom (C60) on the coordinated ether molecule. For compound 2 , the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically except for carbon atoms on three disordered t Bu groups and two disordered ether molecules which coordinate with Al atoms. The three t Bu groups on the phenyl of the ligand are found disordered in adjacent positions with half occupancies of each, while four ethyl groups on the two diethyl ether groups are found disordered in adjacent positions in four sets which are divided using the PART command. For compound 4 non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically except for four disordered t Bu groups on the phenyl rings. The four t Bu groups on the phenyl of ligands are found disordered in adjacent positions with half occupancies of each. Except for the carbon atoms of disordered t Bu groups, hydrogen atom positions were calculated. Crystallographic data for 1 \u2013 4 are summarized in Table 1 .

While one-electron reduction of 1\u02d9 by Cp2Co or KC8 affords the corresponding dithiolate dimers 2 and 3, respectively, one-electron oxidation of 1\u02d9 by Ph3C+BF4- (or O2) conveniently gives 4, the neutral dithiolene dimer.",

Alternatively, 4\u2022 may also be synthesized directly by reaction of 1 with sulfur (in a 1:4 ratio) in THF. Reaction of 4\u2022 with GeCl2\u00b7dioxane gives an anionic germanium(IV)\u2013bis(dithiolene) complex (5).

        "abstract": "Thought suppression means that individuals try to remove the specific thought from consciousness intentionally. Previous research has demonstrated its paradoxical effect in that thought suppression,contrary to its original intention,generally activates the suppressed material.The present study examines the immediate enhancement effect of thought suppression by adopting Page' s online measure paradigm.In two experiments, we examined whether the immediate enhancement effect appeared when negative or positive personality adjectives were suppressed.The result showed:(1) The immediate enhancement effect was observed when negative words were suppressed,which was consistent with the previous research,which means it was difficult to suppress negative materials. (2) No immediate enhancement effect occurred when positive material was suppressed.The findings suggest that suppression actually activates the suppressed material. Furthermore,whether the immediate enhancement effect emerges or not depends on the nature of suppressed material,the negative material isn't suppressed for their threatening nature,and the positive one tends to be suppressed because people are not inclined to suppress it in daily life.",

        "title": "Efficient production of hydrogen from natural gas steam reforming in palladium membrane reactor",
        "abstract": "Ultra-thin, high performance composite palladium membrane, developed via a novel electroless plating method, was applied to construct a membrane reactor for methane steam reforming reaction, which was investigated under the following working conditions: temperature 723\u2013823 K, pressure 300\u2013900 kPa, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) 4000\u20138000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 , steam-to-carbon feed ratio (S/C, mol/mol) 2.5\u20133.5 and sweep ratio (defined as the ratio between flux of sweep gas to that of methane at the inlet of catalyst bed) 0\u20134.3. In contrast with previous investigations using commercial catalysts activated at lower temperatures, the catalyst applied in this work was a nickel-based one pre-reduced at 1023 K. The results indicated that selective removal of H 2 from reaction zone obtained methane conversion much higher than thermodynamic control ones and CO selectivity significantly lower than thermodynamic control values. For instance, 98.8% methane conversion, over 97.0% selectivity to CO 2 and over 95.0% H 2 recovery rate could be obtained under mild working conditions. The much higher performance of membrane reactor was attributed to the combination of hydrogen ultra-permeable Pd-based membrane, highly active catalyst for methane steam reforming with countercurrent sweep gas flux design. Further work on stability investigation may develop an efficient onsite route of hydrogen production for application to proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Keywords Hydrogen production Methane steam reforming Palladium membrane reactor Nickel-based catalyst 1 Introduction Hydrogen production from various fuel sources, particularly biomass-derived fuels through steam reforming, partial oxidation and aqueous phase reforming, etc. [1\u201310] , has been the focus of investigation world wide. For the traditional natural gas (methane) steam reforming (MSR), which is currently carried out using multi-tubular fixed bed reactors to produce syngas (a mixture of H 2 and CO) or H 2 . Renewed interesting in MSR has been increasing, due to the fact that improvement on MSR process promisingly offers lower cost of H 2 for PEMFC application. During MSR, the following reversible reactions occur. (1) C H 4 + H 2 O = CO + 3 H 2 , \u2003 \u0394 H 298 0 = 206 \u2009 kJ / mol (2) CO + H 2 O = C O 2 + H 2 , \u2003 \u0394 H 298 0 = \u2212 41 \u2009 kJ / mol (3) C H 4 + 2 H 2 O = C O 2 + 4 H 2 , \u2003 \u0394 H 298 0 = 165 \u2009 kJ / mol Because of the high endothermicity of reactions (1) and (3) , higher temperature favors forward reactions. Generally, methane conversion over 80.0% could be obtained over 1123 K. To improve energy efficiency, higher reaction pressure is also applied. To efficiently lower reaction temperature and achieve high methane conversion at the same time, equilibria for MSR reaction should be broken, due to the low methane conversion limited by thermodynamics at low temperatures. As the major products in MSR are H 2 and CO 2 at low reaction temperatures, selective removal of CO 2 or H 2 could meet the purpose [11,12] . Calculation performed by setting a residual H 2 ratio in equilibrium composition of MSR reaction showed that higher methane conversion could be obtained at lower temperatures [13] . For example, methane conversion of 94.0% was predicted when 90.0% of H 2 was removed from reaction zone at 773 K. Therefore, Pd membrane, whose mechanism is based on a H 2 solution-diffusion mechanism on perm-selective film, has been applied to construct membrane reactors to shift thermodynamic equilibrium limited reactions [12\u201317] . Advantages of membrane reactor over conventional fixed bed reactor (CFBR) for MSR reaction have been recognized, since Oertel et al. first disclosed improved reaction performances in membrane reactor based on a Pd disk of 100 \u03bcm [18] . However, due to the low H 2 permeance of membrane, reaction temperatures in the range of 973\u20131073 K were still necessary to achieve sufficient methane conversion. To improve H 2 permeance of Pd-based membranes, Kikuchi and co-workers [19,20] invented electroless plating method and prepared thin Pd composite membranes on porous glass substrate. This method was further developed and widely investigated, and some high performance Pd membranes were developed [21] . Using Pd composite membrane in MSR reaction, Kikuchi and co-workers [12] obtained methane conversion of 88.0% at 773 K. Shu et al. [13] investigated MSR reaction in membrane reactor using Pd or Pd-Ag/porous stainless steel composite membranes systematically. Higher reaction temperature, S/C or sweep ratio favored methane conversion, while higher reaction pressure may decrease or increase methane conversion, depending upon other operation parameters. Jorgensen et al. [22] investigated MSR in membrane reactor using a 100 \u03bcm thick 23 wt.% Pd-Ag membrane tube. Methane conversion of 51% was obtained at 773 K and 600 kPa, and it became 61% at 1000 kPa. Possible coke-free working conditions for MSR in membrane reactor were predicted. Lin et al. [23] investigated effect of incipient removal of H 2 through Pd membrane on methane conversion in MSR by experiment and modeling. They found that L/S (load-to-surface ratio, defined as inlet volumetric flux of methane relative to membrane area (m 3 m \u22122 h \u22121 )) and space velocity had great influence on the performances of membrane reactor. Higher space velocity or higher L/S decreased methane conversion. Basile et al. [24] applied a cold-rolled Pd/Ag alloy membrane to construct membrane reactor for MSR. Influences of different kind of sweep gases such as nitrogen, air, steam, CO and O 2 on conversion were reported. By using O 2 sweep gas, methane conversion of 69.0% was obtained at 723 K. Very recently, Tong et al. [25] investigated MSR in membrane reactor using high performance Pd membrane supported on macro-porous stainless steel. Methane conversion of 96.9% and H 2 recovery rate of 90.4% were obtained at 823 K. They also investigated the influence of different kinds of steam reforming catalysts on the performances of membrane reactor [16] . It was found that catalytic performance impacted not only reaction rate but also H 2 flux across Pd membrane, thus separation efficiency of membrane. Thus, renewed interest in developing catalysts suitable for MSR reaction at low temperatures was boosted. For instance, Matsumura and Nakamori [26] investigated catalytic performances of nickel-based catalysts for MSR at 773 K. Nickel catalyst supported on \u03b3-alumina was not well reduced at 773 K and inactive for MSR. However, the catalyst reduced at 973 K was fairly active, while Ni 0 was partially oxidized during reaction. Among catalysts with similar nickel content, the one supported on zirconia was the most active. Kusakabe et al. [27] investigated nickel and precious metal catalysts supported on Ce-ZrO 2 solid solutions for MSR reaction. Supported Rh catalyst showed best performances among Ni, Pt, Ru and Rh. However, nickel catalysts were still the preferred choice, due to their wide availability and cheapness. Nickel supported on Ce 0.15 Zr 0.85 O 2 had obvious superiority over that on \u03b3-alumina. Moreover, investigation by Aparicio et al. [28] on methane dry reforming over nickel catalysts in membrane reactor also suggested that Ce x Zr 1\u2212 x O 2 support, instead of \u03b3-alumina, suppressed coke formation and deposition. The lower CO selectivity and decreased coke deposition may be ascribed to the highly mobile oxygen species, possibly generated through a redox cycle of Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ . Though impregnated nickel catalysts were not so active in MSR reaction, nickel-alumina based catalysts prepared via coprecipitation had shown high activity for higher hydrocarbons steam reforming or methanation reactions in 1980s [29,30] , and these catalysts were still investigated on their application to biomass gasification recently [31] . Ross et al. [32] investigated different nickel/alumina catalysts prepared via coprecipitation or impregnation. Some evidence was found that two types of sites, metallic crystallites and those derived from surface nickel aluminate spinel, may exist on Al 2 O 3 supported catalysts, both of which can participate in MSR and associated reactions. While for nickel/alumina catalysts prepared by coprecipitation, the well-dispersed Ni 0 species derived from surface aluminate may possess good activity for MSR. Our previous work showed that Ni/La-Al 2 O 3 catalysts, prepared via coprecipitation, had good performances for higher hydrocarbons steam reforming [33] . In the process for preparation nickel/alumina catalysts by coprecipitation, precipitation process and calcination temperature were found to play an important role in determining nickel aluminate formation and its existence state [34] . Currently, although high methane conversion has been previously reported, generally, the reaction gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was still small. Furthermore, high fluxes of sweep gases were applied. These working conditions were unpractical, for under most cases, pure H 2 was the desired product. But as suggested by Gallucci et al. [24] , using steam as sweep gas at low sweep ratios may be a good choice for pure H 2 production due to the easy separation of steam by condensation. Thus, in a practical membrane reactor, it is vitally important to find the bottleneck in membrane reactor. Besides high performance membrane for H 2 separation, catalysts with high activity at temperatures around 773 K were also indispensable. But in previous studies [12\u201317,22\u201325,35\u201338] , nickel-based commercial MSR catalysts activated at lower temperatures were applied. As we know, those catalysts were designed for MSR reaction at temperatures as high as 1123 K, their adaptability to MSR in membrane reactor at a much lower reaction temperature are still very unclear and needs further investigation. This work investigated the application of a nickel-based catalyst pre-reduced at high temperature in membrane reactor for MSR reaction. The catalytic performances in CFBR and performances in membrane reactor were reported. 2 Experimental 2.1 Pd membrane preparation The composite Pd membrane was prepared via a novel electroless plating method [39] . The porous \u03b1-alumina support was supplied by Membrane Science and Technology Research Center of Nanjing University of Technology. According to manufacturer's specifications, the length of \u03b1-alumina support was 300 mm, including 250 mm long glaze and 50 mm long porous part. The outer diameter, inner diameter, and nominal pore size of the support tube were 10.0 mm, 6.2 mm and 500 nm, respectively. One end of the support tube was sealed. The open end was applied for the introduction of a sweep gas flux and collection of permeated H 2 and sweep gas, simultaneously. The procedures for Pd composite membrane preparation involved cleaning of the support, modification of the support, followed by successive sensitizing, activation and plating cycles. 2.2 Catalyst preparation and characterizations The raw materials for catalyst preparation were obtained from Shanghai Reagent (Shanghai China) and used as received. The catalyst was prepared by a coprecipitation\u2013deposition method according to the following procedures. First, Mg 4 (OH) 4 (CO 3 ) 2 of particle sizes less than 100 \u03bcm was suspended in deionized water in a beaker, then metal nitrates and ammonia solution with concentrations about 1.0 mol dm \u22123 were simultaneously introduced into the beaker under moderate stirring. After the precipitation process, the resulted mixture was further aged for about 2.0 h, then filtered, washed with ammonia added deionized water, dried at 383 K for 12.0 h, and then calcined at 1173 K for 4.0 h. The incorporation of lanthanum and magnesium into the nickel-alumina catalyst was found in our work to enhance the catalytic activity as well as the resistance to carbon deposition in the steam reforming of hydrocarbons, which would be reported in another work. Similar effect could be expected in MSR reaction, therefore, we incorporated lanthanum and magnesium into catalyst. The composition of catalyst was determined by X-ray fluorescence using a Magix-601 element analyzer. The BET specific surface area, pore size distribution and pore volume of the catalyst were characterized by N 2 adsorption at 77 K using Micromeretics ASAP2010P. Prior to adsorption, the sample was degassed at 623 K for 2.0 h to remove physically adsorbed components. The BET surface area was determined from linear portion of BET equation. Pore volume and average pore diameter were calculated by BJH method using the isotherm desorption branch. H 2 temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted on a self-made micro-reactor, gas chromatograph (GC) system. About 40.0 mg sample was heated from room temperature (RT) to 773 K at 10 K min \u22121 in an Ar flow of 30 mL min \u22121 and kept for 30 min. Then the sample was cooled down to RT. Ar was switched to a 5% H 2 -Ar flux of 30 mL min \u22121 . Then the sample was heated from RT to about 1273 K at 10 or 20 K min \u22121 and H 2 consumption rate was monitored by online-GC equipped with a TCD. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the crystal phases of fresh and utilized catalysts, which was performed on X\u2019 Pert Pro (PW 3071, Philips), with a nickel filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15418 nm), operation voltage of 40 kV and current of 40 mA. The particle size of Ni 0 , or NiO was calculated from the X-ray line broadening measurements. (4) d XRD = 0.89 \u03bb \u03b2 \u2009 cos \u2009 \u03b8 where, d XRD was the volume average diameter of the crystallite, \u03bb the Cu K\u03b1 1 wavelength, \u03b2 the full width at half maximum. 2.3 Methane steam reforming in conventional fixed bed reactor MSR reactions were investigated in a conventioanal fixed bed reactor made up of stainless steel with an inner diameter of 10.0 mm. High purity gases N 2 , H 2 , Ar and CH 4 were utilized. 2.0 g catalyst in grain size range of 420\u2013630 \u03bcm was used without dilution. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was activated in a 30.0% (v/v) H 2 -Ar flux of 50 mL min \u22121 at 1023 K for 3.0 h, details of the reaction and analysis would be described in the next part. The performance of the catalyst were determined at P = 900 kPa and S/C = 3.0 and GHSV in the range of 8000\u201396,000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 . Thermodynamic analysis for the steam reforming of methane was performed using HSC chemistry for Windows V.3.02 (Outokumpu software). The considered reactions include methane steam reforming (Eq. (1) ) and WGS as described in Eq. (2) . 2.4 Hydrogen permeation and methane steam reforming in palladium membrane reactor The schematic diagram for H 2 permeation, MSR reaction in membrane reactor and analysis system are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The Pd membrane tube was located inside the center of a dense stainless steel tube reactor with an inner diameter of 20.0 mm. An annulus chamber between the stainless steel tube and membrane was thus formed and applied for reaction, which also served as the retentate side of the Pd membrane. While the inner volume of the membrane was the permeate side. The reactor was inserted into a heating furnace connected to a temperature controller/programmer. A thermocouple inserted into thermocouple well was placed in the annulus chamber to determine the catalyst bed temperature. For the membrane reactor, the catalyst was pre-reduced at 1023 K for 3.0 h and cooled down to RT gradually. Then, 5.0 g pre-reduced catalyst in the grain size range of 420\u2013630 \u03bcm, diluted with silica was packed to achieve a 60.0 mm catalyst bed height, e.g. the catalyst bed was extended 10.0 mm above the position where the membrane separation started. All the feed gases were controlled by mass flow controllers (Brooks Instrument 5850s). Water was delivered to the reactor by high performance liquid chromatograph pump. The pressure of reaction was maintained by a back-pressure regulator connected with a precise pressure gauge to read the pressures. For gas permeation experiments, pure H 2 or N 2 were applied. The permeation flux of H 2 , or any leakage were measured at different pressure drops across membrane by a single gas method. Before reaction, the reactor was slowly heated to 723 K at a rate of 2 K min \u22121 , after stabilizing, methane and water was gradually introduced to reactor. The flux in the permeate side, those in reaction side were measured with bubble film gas meters and theoretically calculated according to product selectivities. The concentration of products in reaction side and permeate side were monitored online by Varian CP\u20133800 gas chromatograph. The calculation of H 2 purity did not take sweep gas argon into account, although inside the permeate chamber argon sweep gas was applied. Methane conversion ( X C H 4 ) was calculated according Eq. (5) . (5) X C H 4 = [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + [ C H 4 ] \u00d7 100 % H 2 yields were calculated using methane conversion and product selectivities according to Eq. (6) . (6) H 2 \u2009 yield = ( S C O 2 \u00d7 4 + S CO \u00d7 3 ) \u00d7 X C H 4 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization results The composition of catalyst differed a little with the desired compositions, suggesting that the higher pH value used during coprecipitation\u2013deposition would cause some loss of nickel and aluminum cautions [40] . X-ray fluorescence characterization confirmed that the catalyst had a composition of 31.8 wt.% NiO, 11.8 wt.% MgO, and 2.6 wt.% La 2 O 3 and balance alumina, thus the atomic ratio of Ni:Mg:Al:La in the catalyst was 0.43:0.30:1.06:0.015. N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K and pore size distributions are indicated in Fig. 2 . Based on the isotherms, the BET surface area was 103.4 m 2 g \u22121 ; the high BET surface area obtained even under calcination temperature of 1173 K for 4.0 h may be attributed to the hydrotalcite structures developed during coprecipitation. The pore volume was 0.44 cm 3 g \u22121 , and pore size distribution was in the range of 5.0\u201320.0 nm. The XRD patterns of fresh and used catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . Carefully comparing XRD patterns of fresh and used catalysts concluded that both nickel aluminate and magnesium aluminate with spinel structures existed in the fresh catalyst. But due to similarity of reflection peaks for nickel aluminate and magnesium aluminate, strong overlapping of reflection peaks was observed. According to Sloczynski et al. [41] , mixed spinel such as Ni x Mg 1\u2212 x Al 2 O 4 may be formed, too. Seen from Fig. 3 , NiO reflection peaks were not very obvious in fresh catalyst, due to the overlapping of reflections for NiO and spinel structure, which also suggested that NiO existed in the form mainly as surface nickel aluminate, bulk nickel aluminate or even NiO-MgO solid solution. In the XRD patterns of used catalysts, obvious nickel reflection peaks appeared. The \u03b2 values for those peaks representing crystal surfaces of aluminate became smaller due to some reduction of nickel aluminate, suggesting that in the fresh catalyst, both spinel structures of nickel aluminate and magnesium aluminate, and even the mixed spinel structure existed. So the main support phase in the catalyst after reduction might be magnesium aluminate. This agreed with results reported by Bangala et al. [42] , who used mechanically mixed MgO and Al 2 O 3 as support to prepare nickel-base catalyst by impregnation. They found that when calcination temperature was above 1023 K, the magnesium aluminate phase dominated in the support phase. TPR results ( Fig. 4 ) showed two maxima, one at 1055 K and the other at 1159 K when the temperature ramp rate was 10 K min \u22121 . The peak temperature for the reduction of pure NiO was about 700 K or a little higher [43] , depending on the preparation method. In the nickel/alumina catalyst, the reduction peak temperatures were related with the pH values used in precipitation and calcination temperature. Higher pH value and higher calcination temperature shifted TPR peaks to higher temperatures. The first reduction peak shown in Fig. 4 could be ascribed to surface nickel aluminate, possibly existed in the form of solid solution with magnesium aluminate, or an oxide form with strong interaction with alumina and magnesium oxide. The second reduction peak at 1159 K may be ascribed to the formation of stoichiometric nickel aluminate, as suggested by Teixeira and Giudici [44] , who found that reduction peak temperature for bulk nickel aluminate of 1140 K in a sample containing 50.0 wt.% Ni, 4.5 wt.% lanthana and balance alumina, prepared by coprecipitation with a calcination temperature of 1173 K. The associated XRD patterns also showed the evidence of these phases. Increase in temperature ramp rate shifted TPR peaks to higher temperatures. For example, the peak temperature corresponding to the possible bulk nickel aluminate shifted from 1159.5 to 1192.4 K when temperature ramp rate increased from 10 to 20 K min \u22121 . Calculation based on reduction peak temperature shifts concluded that apparent activation energy for reduction of surface nickel aluminate was about 129 kJ mol \u22121 , while the other kind of NiO species showed an apparent activation energy for reduction of about 223 kJ mol \u22121 , which may be ascribed to mono-dispersed nickel species [32] among the crystal structure of magnesium aluminate spinel or the stoichiometric nickel aluminate spinel. 3.2 Methane steam reforming in conventional fixed bed reactor Taking into account the necessity to carry out MSR at a higher pressure to achieve acceptable separation efficiency (defined as the ratio of H 2 flux across membrane (mL min \u22121 ) to H 2 production rate (mL min \u22121 )) under conditions without a sweep gas, the catalytic performances were tested at 723\u2013823 K, P = 900 kPa, S/C = 3.0 and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . It could be seen that in the wide GHSV range, methane conversion close to thermodynamic control ones were obtained. The reaction GHSV was gradually increased until methane conversion showed obvious derivation from thermodynamic control ones. The results in Fig. 5 indicated that at 723 K, in the GHSV range of 8000\u201364,000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 , experimentally determined methane conversion were very close to thermodynamic control value of 13.1%. Further increase in GHSV to 96,000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 led to methane conversion decrease from 13.1% to 11.7%, but methane conversion experimentally determined at 773 and 823 K in the investigated GHSV range of 8000\u201396,000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 showed little derivation from the equilibrium values, which were 19.4% at 773 K, and 27.3% at 823 K, respectively. In comparison with recently reported results on MSR reaction at low reaction temperatures, the catalyst showed much higher performances. For instance, Matsumura and Nakamori [26] investigated nickel catalysts supported on various supports. Over 20 wt.% Ni/ZrO 2 catalysts, methane conversion of 25.5% was obtained at T = 773 K, P = 100 kPa, GHSV = 15,000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 and S/C = 2.0, while the thermodynamic control one under corresponding conditions was 33.8%. Kusakabe et al. [27] recently investigated the catalytic performances of nickel, and precious metals supported on Ce x Zr 1\u2212 x O 2 . The catalysts were activated at 773 K, similar with the activation process in membrane reactor. 3.0 wt.% Rh/Ce 0.15 Zr 0.85 O 2 showed the best performance, and 28.3% methane conversion was achieved at T = 773 K, P = 100 kPa, GHSV = 27,000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 and S/C = 2.0, which was lower than thermodynamic control one of 33.8%, too. The higher performances of the catalyst may be related with its preparation method, calcination and high temperature reduction. During coprecipitation, hydrotalcite structures, which consisted of Brucite-like layers of compositions [Ni x Al 1\u2212 x (OH) 2 ] (1\u2212 x )+ and interlayers containing CO 3 2\u2212 , NO 3 \u2212 or OH \u2212 could be developed. In the hydrotalcite structure, the position of Ni 2+ and Al 3+ could be taken place by other bivalent, or trivalent cations. This resulted in a close interaction of the species incorporated in the hydrotalcite structure. During our catalyst preparation process, all of metallic ions in catalyst precursors could be incorporated into the hydrotalcite structure theoretically. The average particles size of Ni 0 calculated by line broadening of nickel (2 0 0) reflection peak was 19.1 nm. However, as discussed by Ross et al. [32] , the high activity of catalyst may be related with a kind of active sites derived from the surface or bulk nickel aluminate. The surface or bulk nickel aluminate was related to the hydrotalcite structure formation during coprecipitation and calcination. During reduction, due to the strong interaction of alumina with nickel oxide, isolated (mono-dispersed) nickel atoms may be formed according to Eq. (7) [32] . (7) The resultant nickel Ni(0) still closely associated with alumina structure and their catalytic activity may be closely related with alumina. The formed mono-dispersed nickel site showed different hydrogen adsorption behaviors from that of bulk nickel crystallites and they could possibly participate in MSR as described in the following: (8) The CH 3 and OH species subsequently react to give steam reforming products. In our point of view, a higher turnover frequency on active site derived from nickel aluminate than bulk nickel crystallite was expected due to the close proximity of nickel and alumina, or maybe other species like magnesia and lanthana. Both of them had ability to adsorb steam. Provided that the surface reaction of adsorbed carbon species and adsorbed steam was the rate-determining step, the following influences of close proximity of nickel and other oxide species were reasonably deduced. Firstly, it affected the electronic structure of nickel; partial apparent positive electronic charge was predicted in Ni(0) derived from aluminate, which may favor the adsorption of methane. Secondly, it may decrease the surface diffusion path due to close proximity of adsorbed species, thus a higher turnover frequency was predicted. Thirdly, this kind of active sites may show much higher coke deposition resistance due to the fact the interaction between the adsorbed carbon species is difficult to take place. In summary, it is probably that two kinds of nickel species exist in the catalyst, metallic crystallites and sites derived from nickel aluminate, after higher temperature reduction of the catalyst, mono-dispersed nickel may be formed, which may be related with the high MSR activities at lower temperatures. However, no direct evidence for confirmation of the existence mono-dispersed nickel could be provided for the time being, for conventional characterization techniques are incapable in getting such evidence. Thus, further investigation is indispensable to clarify the problem. 3.3 Performances of Pd membrane for H 2 permeation The H 2 permeance and H 2 /N 2 separation coefficient of membrane were determined with pure N 2 and H 2 at 100 kPa pressure drop across the membrane at 773 K. The H 2 permeance of the membrane was 70 m 3 (m 2 bar h) \u22121 , while no permeation of nitrogen across the Pd membrane was detected under the same conditions, suggesting an almost infinite H 2 selectivity. The length of the Pd membrane was 50 mm, the membrane area was 15.7 cm 2 . The calculated membrane thickness based on weight increase after plating was about 4.0 \u03bcm in thickness. The H 2 permeation behavior under different H 2 partial pressure drops across the membrane and different temperatures were measured using single gas method, too. The permeate side was kept atmospheric pressure. The H 2 permeation flux versus H 2 partial pressure drops across membrane at 773 K was shown in Fig. 6 . It suggested that under wide range of pressure drops across membrane, H 2 permeation flux was almost proportional to H 2 partial pressure drops. The exponent value of H 2 partial pressure was about 1.0, showing great derivation from Sievert's law. This indicated that rate-determining step in H 2 permeation across Pd membrane was H 2 dissociative adsorption on Pd surface rather than the bulk diffusion, due to the fact that Pd membrane was only about 4.0 \u03bcm thick [25] . Furthermore, not only increase in H 2 permeation flux with increasing H 2 partial pressure drop across membrane, but also a H 2 flux of 0.86 mol m \u22122 s \u22121 at T = 773 K and 100 kPa H 2 partial pressure difference were obtained. The nitrogen permeation flux under similar conditions was found to be almost zero, suggesting that the H 2 /N 2 separation coefficient was almost infinite. Comparison with literature results are listed in Table 1 , which suggested that Pd membrane had very high performance for H 2 permeation and separation. The influence of separation temperature on H 2 permeation flux of the membrane is shown in Fig. 7 . The good linearity of the curve indicated that under test temperature range, there was no change of rate-determining steps for H 2 permeation. From this Arrhenius plot, apparent activation energy of 14.9 kJ mol \u22121 for H 2 permeation across the membrane was estimated, which agreed with well the results previously reported [24] . 3.4 Methane steam reforming in palladium membrane reactor 3.4.1 Influences of the reaction temperature The major advantage of membrane reactor was conversion enhancement of an equilibrium-limited reaction by selective removal of products. In the case of MSR reaction, membrane reactor can lead to significantly enhanced methane conversion at a lower temperature. However, when reaction temperature was below 673 K, the reforming reaction could not reach a satisfactory conversion level due to the relative low reaction kinetics of MSR, and thermodynamic equilibrium may not be reached. While removal of H 2 through Pd membrane could only slightly shift reforming equilibrium due to the intrinsically favorable temperature influences over 973 K, and high temperature may destroy the Pd membrane, too. Thus, reaction temperature in the range of 723\u2013873 K was usually applied. In such a temperature range, membrane separate H 2 efficiently and higher methane conversion in membrane reactor could be obtained. As shown in Fig. 8 , methane conversion in membrane reactor was significantly increased by 260\u2013400% compared with equilibrium values. For instance, under working conditions of P = 900 kPa, GHSV = 4000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 , S/C = 3.0 and I = 2.6, methane conversion was 65.0% at 723 K, while the equilibrium one was only 13.2%. Within 723\u2013823 K, increase in reaction temperature monotonically increased methane conversion. This was ascribed to the fact that higher temperature favor MSR reaction kinetics as well as H 2 permeation, which resulted in higher separation efficiency. But impact of temperature became not as pronounced as that at lower temperatures. At 773 K, methane conversion was 88.7%, increase in temperature from 723 to 773 K led to methane conversion increase by 23.7%, while methane conversion increased by only about 10% when the reaction temperature was further increased from 773 to 823 K. As we know, performance of Pd membrane was determined by at least by three interrelated factors: (1) MSR reaction kinetics; (2) H 2 separation efficiency; (3) radial diffusion of H 2 from reaction location to Pd membrane surface in the reaction side. By the combination of highly active steam reforming catalyst, high performance Pd membrane, and a special sweep gas design, methane conversion of 98.8%, and 95.4% H 2 recovery rate was achieved under mild working conditions ( T = 823 K, P = 900 kPa, GHSV = 4000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 , S/C = 3.0 and I = 2.6), which was about 93.7% of maximum theoretical H 2 yield. Besides the enhanced methane conversion, CO formation was efficiently suppressed, too. As we know, H 2 selective removal also shifted reaction (2) to the right side. So, a non-monotonic dependence of CO selectivity upon reaction temperature was observed within 723\u2013823 K, e.g. CO selectivity first increased with reaction temperature within 723\u2013773 K, and then showed a slight decrease within 773\u2013823 K. But they were much lower than thermodynamic equilibrium ones. For instance, an experimental CO selectivity of 2.7% was observed at 773 K, while the equilibrium one was 5.6%. At 773 and 798 K, the CO selectivity was almost the same. Then increase in reaction temperatures led to a slight CO selectivity decline, which was shown clearly in Fig. 8 . The CO formation was suppressed, which was more pronounced when the reaction temperature was high within 723\u2013823 K. At 723 K, CO selectivity was reduced by 41% compared with the equilibrium one; while CO selectivity was reduced from 11.0 to 2.4% by 69.1% at 823 K. Increase in reaction temperature also gradually enhanced the recovery rate of hydrogen, for instance, at 723 K, recovery rate of hydrogen was 89.0%, it increased to 95.4% at 823 K. 3.4.2 Influences of reaction pressure In a CFBR, increase in reaction pressure would result in decreased methane conversion, and lower CO selectivity due to the impact of the thermodynamic equilibrium for MSR. However, in membrane reactor, this trend may be changed. Although a higher reaction pressure is unfavorable for methane conversion at thermodynamic equilibrium, the increase in reaction pressures may lead to a higher H 2 partial pressure in the reaction side in membrane reactor, which increases the driving force for H 2 permeation and enhanced H 2 separation efficiency, higher methane conversion under certain conditions could be expected. For example, Tong et al. [25] disclosed that the influence of reaction pressure on methane conversion was related with the reaction GHSV at 100\u2013300 kPa. At lower GHSV, an increase in pressures resulted in a higher methane conversion. While at a higher GHSV of 2000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 , a slight decrease of methane conversion was observed. In our previous work on higher hydrocarbons steam reforming in Pd membrane reactor, in the pressure range of 200\u2013400 kPa, an increase of selectivity to methane was also found when reactions were carried out at T = 823 K, S/C = 2.7 and I = 0 [49] , suggesting increasing reaction pressure was unfavorable for methane conversion under these working conditions. The simulation results reported by Gallucci et al. [38] also revealed that, for a membrane-aided reaction system, an increase of reaction pressure corresponds to either an increase or to a decrease in methane conversion, depending on the combination of pressure, temperature, membrane thickness and reactor length. In our point of view, only when H 2 separation efficiency improvement predominated over thermodynamic equilibrium effect, an increase in methane conversion was predicted when reaction pressure increased. The influences of pressure on methane conversion in this work were investigated at T = 773 K, GHSV = 4000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 , S/C = 3.0 and I = 2.6 and the results are shown in Fig. 9 . Increase in reaction pressure from 300 to 900 kPa resulted in a monotonic methane conversion enhancement from 67.6 to 88.7%, while the equilibrium controlled methane conversion were predicted to decrease from 29.3 to 19.4%. This agreed with results previously reported by Uemiya et al. [2] and Prokopiev et al. [4] , e.g. methane conversion increased upon reaction pressure. In our work, higher reaction pressure also suppressed CO formation more efficiently. For example, at 773 K and 300 kPa, CO selectivity was 6.1%; while at reaction pressure of 900 kPa, it was only 2.3%. In contrast with thermodynamic control ones, the trend that CO selectivity decreased with increasing reaction pressure was also observed, but CO reduction by 30\u201360% was obtained, and this effect was more obvious at higher pressures. Due to the ultra-thin property of the palladium membrane, increase in reaction pressure at T = 773 K, GHSV = 4000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 , S/C = 3.0 and I = 2.6 monotonically enhanced the recovery rate of hydrogen from 71.0% at 300 kPa to 91.8% at 900 kPa. Thus, the influence of reaction pressure upon methane conversion was a compromise between the influence of thermodynamic equilibrium, and the H 2 separation efficiency which functions oppositely. The monotonic increase of methane conversion with reaction pressure in this work indicates that, the separation efficiency of the Pd membrane is sufficiently high to dominate the performance of Pd membrane reactor under those conditions. Although in the membrane reactor for MSR, reaction pressures as high as 900 kPa was applied, the membrane also showed almost infinite H 2 selectivity under the severe working conditions because no CO 2 or CH 4 was detected in the permeate side. 3.4.3 Influences of reaction gas hourly space velocity The influences of reaction GHSV on methane conversion and selectivity to CO are illustrated in Fig. 10 . A comparison between methane conversion in membrane reactor and those in CFBR was also made. As expected, methane conversion in CFBR was almost unchanged, and close to thermodynamic control value irrespective of reaction GHSV, suggesting the catalyst had sufficient activity for MSR reaction at T = 823 K, P = 900 kPa and S/C = 3.0. While in Pd membrane reactor, a monotonic decrease of methane conversion with increasing reaction GHSV was observed. Methane conversion decreased from 98.6 to 86.0%, when reaction GHSV increased from 4000 to 8000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 . These results could be related with some interrelated factors. Higher reaction GHSV increased the L/S for the Pd membrane and a shorter residence time, thus a shorter time for the H 2 produced in the reaction to diffuse from the reaction location to membrane surface. On L/S influences, Lin et al. [23] predicted a decreased methane conversion with increasing L/S in the range of 0.1\u201310.0 m 3 h \u22121 m \u22122 , when the reaction was carried out at WHSV (weight hourly space velocity) less than 1.0 h \u22121 , T = 773 K, P = 900 kPa or 2000 kPa and I = 0. Highest methane conversion of 85.8% was achieved under reaction conditions T = 773 K, P = 2000 kPa, WHSV = 0.3 h \u22121 , L/S = 0.3 m 3 h \u22121 m \u22122 and I = 0. In our work, at T = 823 K, GHSV = 4000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 , S/C = 3.0, L/S = 3.5 m 3 h \u22121 m \u22122 and I = 2.6, methane conversion of 98.6% was obtained. And increase in GHSV from 4000 to 8000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 only caused a limited methane conversion decrease from 98.6 to 86.0%, which are much better than the results predicted by Lin et al. [23] . The variation in GHSV has no effects on thermodynamic control CO selectivity, but in membrane reactor, the higher GHSV, the higher CO selectivity was observed. For instance, the CO selectivity was only 2.4% at GHSV = 4000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 and 6.3% at GHSV of 8000, while the equilibrium one was 11.0%. Increase in GHSV leads to lower recovery rate of hydrogen. For instance, under the investigated working conditions, recovery rate of hydrogen was 95.4% at GHSV = 4000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 , it decreased to 90.1% and 85.0% at GHSV = 6000, 8000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 , respectively. Besides the effects of reaction kinetics, another physical process \u2013 radial mixing diffusion of H 2 from the reaction location to the Pd membrane surface in a packed-bed type of Pd membrane reactor would also impact the membrane separation efficiency, and this process was closely related to the residence time. Itoh et al. [50] found that calculation based on ideal flow model would give higher separation efficiency than calculation results based on radial diffusion model. Thus, it could be assumed that when the permeance of the Pd was sufficiently high and the kinetics of the catalyst fast enough, performances of the membrane reactor would be determined by neither the kinetics of catalyst nor the H 2 permeation across the Pd membrane, instead, the physical process, radial diffusion of H 2 from reaction location to Pd membrane surface, may determine the performances of membrane reactor. However, this could be solved by using hollow fiber membranes or capillary membrane module to shorten the diffusion path [21] . Under our reaction conditions, as the catalyst applied was highly active, and the Pd membrane could permeate H 2 through fast enough, we ascribed the moderate decrease of methane conversion, largely to the influences of radial diffusion time shortening, which are to be confirmed by modeling. Of course, other effects such as concentration polarization would also result in a lower separation efficiency which was inevitable in gas mixture separation [51] . When reaction GHSV increased, H 2 flux across membrane also increased, thus the concentration polarization effects are more severe. 3.4.4 Influences of steam-to-carbon feed ratio MSR reaction was carried out above a stoichiometric S/C to avoid carbon deposition over catalysts usually, which also enhance the steam reforming forward reactions. In CFBR, S/C of 3.0\u20134.0 is usually applied. While in membrane reactor, on one hand, lower reaction temperature would promise a lower S/C for carbon deposition suppression; on the other hand, due to the selective removal of H 2 by Pd membrane and high selectivity to CO 2 , S/C higher than 2.0 are necessary. So, S/C for MSR reaction in membrane reactor was usually kept within 2.0\u20134.0. The effects of S/C ratio on methane conversion and CO selectivity obtained at T = 823 K, P = 500 kPa and GHSV of methane = 1000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 are shown in Fig. 11 . The methane conversion in CFBR increases monotonically with increasing S/C. In this work, the same trend was also observed. Increase in S/C from 2.5 to 3.5 led to methane conversion increment from 93.8 to 99.0% in the membrane reactor. But the H 2 recovery rate does not change monotonically with increasing S/C. Actually, a decrease of recovery from 97.5% to about 94% was found in our experimental conditions when the S/C was increased from 2.5 to 3.5. Lower CO selectivity was also observed at a higher S/C. At S/C of 2.5, the CO selectivity was 6.5% while thermodynamic control one was 11.8%; at S/C of 3.5, the corresponding values were 2.4% and 10.5%, respectively. However, maximum H 2 yield was found at S/C = 3.0 in the investigated conditions. The results suggested that too large an excess of steam dilutes the H2 in the products mixture, which results in a decrease of the H2 partial pressure drop across the membrane and thus in a lower recovery rate of hydrogen. For instance, increase in S/C ratio from 2.5 to 3.5 resulted in recovery rate of hydrogen decrease from 97.0 to 94.0%. Shu et al. [13] gave a detailed investigation on the effects of S/C on methane conversion in Pd-based membrane reactors. The trend that higher S/C resulted in higher methane conversion at T = 773 K, P = 136 kPa, GHSV = 1067 h \u22121 and I = 1.0, was also found. Calculation made by Jogensen et al. [22] showed that by keeping S/C higher than 2.5, it was possible to avoid carbon deposition, even if H 2 was removed from reaction at 773 K. So, in our work, S/C was kept around 3.0 and no carbon deposition was found during reaction. 3.4.5 Influence of sweep gas flux A sweep gas is important to maintain a higher H 2 partial pressure drop across membrane to promote H 2 permeation and H 2 recovery rate, especially when reaction pressure is low. Generally, a higher sweep ratio promises a higher methane conversion [12,13] . The influences of sweep ratio on methane conversion and CO selectivity are indicated in Fig. 12 . The reactions were carried out at T = 823 K, P = 500 kPa, GHSV = 6000 mL \u2009 g cat \u2212 1 \u2009 h \u2212 1 and S/C = 3.0. Methane conversion was much lower when no sweep gas was used comparing to that using a low sweep ratio. For example, increase in methane conversion from 64.0 to 84.6% was obtained when the sweep ratio was increased from 0 to 1.7. However, increase in the sweep ratio from 1.7 to 3.4 only resulted in methane conversion increase from 84.6 to 89.8%. The effect of sweep ratio on CO selectivity was also small. The CO selectivity was 10.5% at I = 0, slightly lower than thermodynamic control one of 13.8%; while it was 7.6% at I = 3.4. The recovery rate of hydrogen also significantly increased from 57.5% at I = 0 to 80.9% at I = 1.7. However, further increase sweep ratio to I = 2.6 and I = 3.4 only lead to recovery rate of hydrogen of 82.7 and 85.2%, respectively. The fast leveling off of sweep gas influences on methane conversion and CO selectivity may be related with the sweep gas design mode. As previously reported [49] , a countercurrent sweep gas design brought out an almost zero H 2 partial pressure at the position where membrane separation ended irrespective of sweep ratio. The leveling off of sweep ratio effect was also found in previous investigations [12,13] . Simulation models build by Oklany et al. [36] also predicted the same trend, too. The sweep gas design mode also had great influences on the H 2 partial pressure distributions in the permeate side along the axis of the Pd membrane. In a co-current sweep gas mode, the H 2 partial pressure in the reaction side first increases along the catalyst bed, then decreases when H 2 flux through Pd membrane was higher than H 2 production rate. While in the permeate side, H 2 partial pressure increases along the axis of the Pd membrane due to the accumulation of H 2 along the axis of the membrane. As the permeance of the Pd membrane was sufficiently high, the driving force for H 2 permeation at the position where the separation ended was supposed to greatly affect the separation efficiency of the Pd membrane. Co-current sweep gas would result in a higher H 2 partial pressure at the position where membrane separation ended than a countercurrent sweep in the permeate side. So, a higher separation efficiency and H 2 recovery rate could be expected, when a countercurrent sweep gas was designed, instead of a concurrent sweep gas. The high H 2 recovery, high separation efficiency of the Pd membrane was attributed to the combination the high permeance Pd membrane with the sweep gas operated in a countercurrent mode. To sum up, the performances of Pd membrane reactor are closely related to the performance of Pd membrane, catalyst applied, working conditions and special design of membrane reactor configuration. Results achieved in thus work are compared with previous investigations in terms of methane conversion, as shown in Table 2 . From the table, it has been clearly demonstrated that almost complete methane conversion could be achieved under mild working conditions. This process may find its application to on-site hydrogen production for application to proton exchange membrane fuel cells, using the widely available natural gas infrastructure. 4 Conclusions High performance Pd composite membrane was successfully developed via a novel electroless plating method and applied to construct a membrane reactor for methane steam reforming (MSR) reaction at lower reaction temperatures. In contrast with most previous investigations, nickel-based catalyst prepared by coprecipitation\u2013deposition and pre-reduced at higher temperature was applied for MSR in the membrane reactor, which also showed high activity for MSR at low reaction temperatures in conventional fixed bed reactor. The high activity may be ascribed to the formation of spinel structure during calcination, after reduction, it was supposed that nickel species was well segregated and even mono-dispersed, which needs further confirmation. The combination of highly active MSR catalyst, high permeance Pd membrane and a countercurrent sweep gas design resulted in a much better results than those previously reported, a H 2 yield of 3.74 was achieved under optimized, mild working conditions. Not only methane conversion much higher than thermodynamic control ones but also CO selectivity much lower than thermodynamic control values were achieved in this work. As the permeance of the Pd membrane was high and the kinetics of catalyst fast, the performance of the membrane reactor may be determined by radial diffusion or concentration polarizations. So, in the modeling and simulation works, as well as in a practical membrane reactor, these influences could not be ignored. Currently, great effort is focused on the process durability aspects.

By using the air distributor, air can meet methane only on the active surface of the catalyst, so their gas-phase pre-mixing can be avoided. By using the air distributor, O2/CH4 mole ratio can be kept lower and the composition is beyond explosive limit to improve safety of the system. Effects of distribution ratio of air (expressed as D) on catalytic performance, axial temperature distribution and axial species distribution along the catalyst bed were investigated. The results indicated that composition of products is determined by catalyst bed outlet temperature despite the changing of D. When D is 80%, low n(O2):n(CH4) (0.10-0.22) is kept along the axial catalyst bed, the hot-spot forming near the entrance of catalyst bed is reduced, and an even temperature distribution along the whole axial catalyst bed was obtained, which ascribes to advantage of methane partial oxidation over its complete oxidation.",

        "abstract": "Currently, H2 production techniques for application to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are intensively investigated, aiming to realize a clean hydrogen society. Due to the limitation by the ther- modynamics of methane steam reforming (MSR), multi-reactions and multi-steps should be performed before the generated H2-rich gas could be delivered to PEMFC, which inevitably increases the cost of H2. However, using a thermodynamic shifting membrane reformer, H2 could be produced compactly from MSR, provided that the catalyst showed high performance for MSR reaction and membrane efficiently removed H2 from the reaction zone. We presented here a Pd-based membrane reformer for MSR reaction. In contrast with previous reports, nickel-based catalyst pre-reduced at high temperature was applied in this work, as well as high performance Pd-based membrane. The performances of the membrane reformer in terms of H2 production capacity were also widely investigated. It was found that combination of an active catalyst for MSR and a H2 ultra-permeable Pd membrane obtained high flux of H2 across the mem- brane and recovery rate of H2 in the membrane reformer. For instance, 98.8% methane conversion, over 97.0% selectivity to CO2 and over 95.0% recovery rate of H2 were obtained under mild working conditions. Simultaneously, the hydrogen flux across the membrane reached 18.6 m",

        "title": "Hydrogen production from the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons in membrane reactor",
        "abstract": "Hydrogen production from the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons over a self-made nickel catalyst was investigated in a fixed bed palladium membrane reactor (PMR). The reactions were carried out at 723\u2013823 K and 200\u2013900 kPa. The applied Pd membrane was developed by a novel electroless plating method. The influences of working conditions on the performance of the PMR were also studied. The results indicate that the membrane has a H 2 permeance of 50.0 m 3 m \u22122 h \u22121 bar \u22121 and a H 2 /N 2 separation coefficient of 1200, determined at 773 K and transmembrane pressure of 100 kPa using a single gas method. Owing to the selective removal of H 2 by the membrane, the yield of H 2 greatly increased; meanwhile the yield of CH 4 efficiently decreased. The purity of H 2 in the permeate side of membrane could be maintained over 99.5%. H 2 production capacity of the PMR could be as high as 23.1 m 3 m \u22122 h \u22121 (m 3 H 2 per m 2 membrane area per hour) under optimized working conditions. The reactions in the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons and H 2 separation are highly integrated in the PMR, which suggests that the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons in PMR could be an attractive process for H 2 production under mild reaction conditions. Keywords Hydrogen production Liquid hydrocarbons Steam reforming Palladium membrane reactor Nickel catalyst 1 Introduction Hydrogen production is a matter of great importance, both in refinery and clean fuel production recently. However, a renewed interest in its production processes has emerged, driven by the spectacular fuel cell technologies. H 2 is the ideal fuel for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFC), nowadays being efficiently produced from methane, naphtha, gasoline, diesel and the like [1\u20133] . Large-scale H 2 production by the steam reforming of methane or naphtha is well established in the chemical industry [2] . An industrial steam reformer typically consists of a fixed bed reactor made up of a large number of catalyst tubes, surrounded by a huge top-/side-fired furnace. Usually, steam reforming of higher hydrocarbons can be represented by the following reactions [4,5] : (1) C n H m + n H 2 O = n CO + ( n + m / 2 ) H 2 \u2003 ( for isooctane , n = 8 , \u0394 H 298 \u00b0 = 1273 \u2009 kJ/mol ) (2) CO + 3 H 2 \u21cc C H 4 + H 2 O \u2003 ( \u0394 H 298 \u00b0 = \u2212 206 \u2009 kJ/mol ) (3) CO + H 2 O \u21cc C O 2 + H 2 \u2003 ( \u0394 H 298 \u00b0 = \u2212 41.1 \u2009 kJ/mol ) Higher hydrocarbons are irreversibly converted into CO and H 2 , followed by the fast methanation and water\u2013gas shift reaction (WGS). In a conventional fixed bed reactor (CFBR), although higher hydrocarbons could be completely converted using suitable catalysts at 723\u2013823 K, the yield of CH 4 is controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium and usually high. Thus, in the traditional naphtha steam reforming process, to achieve an acceptable yield of H 2 , it is necessary to carry out the reactions at temperatures up to 1123 K. In addition, the downstream processing of CO by WGS and H 2 purification are also necessary [6] . Thus, the whole process is complicated, and uneconomical for small-scale H 2 production. Therefore, small scale H 2 production process requires further investigation to meet the requirements of purity, economy, and versatility for its use in fuel processor systems coupled to fuel cells [7] . The utilization of membrane reactors (MR) is one of the most interesting options to consider, given its advantages related to heat and energy management, and the integration of two different processes (reaction and separation) in a single unit. In the case of steam reforming of higher hydrocarbons, provided that higher hydrocarbons are fully converted and thermodynamic equilibrium established, the use of a hydrogen-permselective membrane could break the thermodynamic equilibrium of methanation (Eq. (2) ) and WGS (Eq. (3) ) reactions. In this way, H 2 production could be enhanced, while methane formation suppressed. So, it is feasible to avoid the high temperature reactions and the complex downstream processing in the traditional naphtha steam reforming process by using MR. Pd membranes, whose operation is based on a H 2 solution\u2013diffusion mechanism on a permselective film, could efficiently separate H 2 from the reaction zone. Thus, intensive investigation on their application to reactions such as dehydrogenation, steam reforming and dry reforming has been performed [8\u201310] . For instance, investigation on methane steam reforming using PMR [8,11\u201313] suggested that methane conversions much higher than thermodynamically controlled ones could be obtained. However, the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons in PMR was seldom experimentally investigated. Recently, Chen et al. [14\u201317] simulated n -heptane steam reforming in a circulating fluidized bed membrane reformer (CFBMR). It was predicted that H 2 could be efficiently produced from the steam reforming of n -heptane at 723\u2013823 K. Compared with those obtained in CFBR, the yield of H 2 could be increased by about 300% in the CFBMR. Owing to the wide availability of fixed bed reactors and their convenience, cheapness and simplicity, H 2 production from the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons in a fixed bed PMR was experimentally investigated in this work. It was found that the reactions in the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons and H 2 separation could be efficiently integrated in the PMR. Pure H 2 production from the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons could be realized at temperatures lower than 823 K using only one fixed bed PMR and one catalyst. Influences of working conditions such as temperature, pressure, steam-to-carbon feed ratios (S/C ratios), gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and sweep gas flux on the performance of the PMR were also investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Pd membrane The Pd membrane was supported on a porous \u03b1-alumina tube by a novel electroless plating method developed in our lab [18] . The support has an o.d. = 10.0 mm, an i.d. = 6.2 mm and a nominal pore size of 500 nm. One end of the membrane is closed. The total length of the tube, the length of the porous part and the effective separation area are 300 mm, 50 mm and 15.7 cm 2 , respectively. 2.2 Catalyst The applied catalyst was prepared by a coprecipitation method. The procedure was described in a previous report [19] . The catalyst was composed of 50.0 wt.% NiO, 10.0 wt.% La 2 O 3 and balance alumina, determined by X-ray fluorescence using Magix-601 (Philips). The catalyst was found to show good catalytic performance in the gasoline surrogate steam reforming at about 773 K in a CFBR [19] . 2.3 Reaction and instruments Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the reaction and analysis system. The membrane tube was located at the center of a stainless steel (SS) tube (i.d. = 20 mm), making an annulus reaction chamber (reaction side or retentate side). Graphite O-rings and modified compression fittings afforded leak-free seal at pressures up to 1500 kPa. The volume inside the membrane tube was the permeate side. In the permeate side, a dense SS tube (o.d. = 3 mm) was located near the closed end of the membrane tube for the introduction of a sweep gas flux. The countercurrent operation mode, owing to its superiority over the cocurrent one [17] , was applied. A movable thermocouple (o.d. = 1 mm) detected the temperature of the catalyst bed. The pressures in the reaction side were controlled by a backpressure regulator. A precise pressure gauge read the pressures. The permeate side was maintained at atmospheric pressure. In the reaction chamber, 5.5 g catalyst in the grain size range of 420\u2013630 \u03bcm, diluted by silica of the same size, was packed to achieve a catalyst bed length of 80 mm. Thus, the catalyst bed was extended 30 mm, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1 . The MR was inserted into an electronic heating furnace controlled by a temperature controller/programmer. The fuel feedstock is a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons with carbon numbers in the range of 4\u20138 (light distillate of Daqing F\u2013T plants, simplified as fuel in the following text). The average molecular formula of the fuel was C 6.43 H 14.84 and the molecular weight 92.0 g mol \u22121 . Fuel and water were metered and delivered to the evaporator by HPLC pumps. After evaporation and mixing at 573 K; they were preheated to about 723 K before entering the reactor. H 2 was also fed to the reaction at a hydrogen-to-carbon molar ratio (H 2 /C) of 0.1. The flux of H 2 , or sweep gas Ar were controlled by mass flowmeter (Brooks Instrument 5850S). Prior to reaction, the catalyst was heated in a pure Ar flux of 50 cm 3 min \u22121 at a rate of 2 K min \u22121 to 673 K to avoid the H 2 embrittlement of the Pd Membrane. Then a 30% (v/v) H 2 \u2013Ar gas stream of 200 cm 3 min \u22121 was introduced and the temperature was further increased to 823 K at a rate of 2 K min \u22121 and kept for 3 h. The gas compositions in the reaction side, or those in the permeate side were determined by an online Varian CP-3800 GC equipped with TCD (thermal conductivity detector) and FID (flame ionization detector). Ar was the carrier gas for the GC, so the purity of H 2 in the permeate side, with or without sweep gas, can be determined (if sweep gas was applied, the calculation of H 2 purity does not take it into account). Under the experimental conditions, no higher hydrocarbons in the products were detected. Thus, the conversion of fuel is supposed to be 100%. On the calculation of the reaction GHSV, fuel flux is converted to the equal methane flux ( F C H 4 ) based on the carbon balance according to: (4) F C H 4 \u2009 ( ml/min ) = flux of \u2009 C 6.43 H 14.84 \u00d7 \u03c1 \u00d7 6.43 92 \u00d7 22 , 400 where, \u03c1 was the average density of fuel (g cm \u22123 ), the unit for the flux of C 6.43 H 14.88 is ml min \u22121 . And yield of H 2 ( Y H ), yield of CH 4 ( Y M ), sweep ratio ( I ) and H 2 recovery rate ( R H ) are defined or calculated by the following equations: (5) Y H = molar hydrogen produced molar fuel feed (6) Y M = molar methane produced molar fuel feed (7) I = flux of sweep gas F C H 4 (8) R H = H 2 \u2009 flux across the Pd membrane H 2 production rate + H 2 \u2009 flux in the feed \u00d7 100 % Simultaneously, the flux of the gas in the permeate side, and those from the outlet of the PMR were measured by soap film flowmeter after the condensing of the steam. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Palladium membrane properties The H 2 permeance and H 2 /N 2 separation coefficient of the Pd membrane were determined with pure N 2 and H 2 at 773 K and transmembrane pressure of 100 kPa. The membrane has a H 2 permeance of 50 m 3 m \u22122 bar \u22121 h \u22121 , a H 2 /N 2 separation coefficient of 1200. The membrane thickness is estimated about 4.5 \u03bcm based on the weight increase after the plating process. Comparison with some literature data was made [13] , and the results are listed in Table 1 . From the results, it could be concluded that the developed membrane has a high H 2 permeance and a good H 2 /N 2 separation coefficient. 3.2 Back permeation of hydrogen and its suppression Usually, pure H 2 is the desired product in steam reforming. Thus, sweep gas in the permeate side cannot apply, except using steam at low sweep ratios [20] . In addition, vacuum application, is also unlikely due to its high energy consumption. When no sweep gas was applied, to obtain H 2 permeation through all the membrane area from the reaction side to the permeate side, the local partial pressures of H 2 near the interface of the membrane in the reaction side should exceed 101.3 kPa. However, in the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons, S/C ratios are usually >2.0 to avoid coke deposition. Such reaction conditions correspond to over 90 mol% steam at the inlet of the catalyst bed. Thus, if the length of catalyst bed equals that of the Pd membrane, back permeation of H 2 , as illustrated in Fig. 2 , necessarily takes place near the inlet of the catalyst bed. This back permeation of H 2 becomes a disadvantage in terms of R H and the efficient utilization of the membrane. Generally, three ways could be applied to avoid this phenomenon. (1) Using a sweep gas. However, it reduces the concentration of H 2 . (2) The addition of H 2 in the feedstock. However, as suggested by Chen et al. [21] , H 2 partial pressure has great influence on the kinetics and thermodynamic equilibrium of n -heptane steam reforming. Higher H 2 partial pressures in the feedstock decrease not only the reaction rate but also Y H . Thus, although a low concentration of H 2 in the feedstock may enhance the reaction rate, it is not sufficient to suppress the back permeation of H 2 . A higher partial pressure of H 2 in the feedstock slows the reaction rate, at the same time enhancing the formation of CH 4 instead of H 2 . Moreover, it is probable that H 2 in the feedstock could not be efficiently recovered by the membrane. (3) Using an extended catalyst bed. It makes the steam and higher hydrocarbons react before contacting the membrane area, achieving an H 2 partial pressure higher than 101.3 kPa. A higher performance of the PMR could be expected by using such a MR configuration, which had been experimentally demonstrated in methane steam reforming using a PMR [22] . Actually, the simulation work by Chen et al. [17] indicated that, in a CFBMR with a catalyst bed length of 2 m, the necessary catalyst bed length for the complete conversion of n -heptane is only 0.3 m at 823 K. As the steam reforming of higher hydrocarbons is irreversible, and the methanation and WGS reactions reach their equilibrium as soon as the higher hydrocarbons are fully converted. The selective removal of H 2 is supposed to break the thermodynamic equilibrium of methane steam reforming and WGS reactions, which continue to take place in the rest of the reactor. Thus, ideally, the MR should be designed in such a way that the catalyst in the extended part is just sufficient for the complete conversion of higher hydrocarbons. Therefore, both the catalyst and the membrane could be efficiently utilized in the PMR. 3.3 Influence of working conditions on the performance of membrane reactor 3.3.1 Influence of reaction GHSV The influence of reaction GHSV on Y H and R H were investigated at T = 823 K, S/C = 2.7 and H 2 /C = 0.1. Fig. 3 shows the results. Increasing reaction GHSV leads to lower Y H and R H in the PMR. For instance, Y H decreased from 11.2 to 10.4 at P = 500 kPa, from 14.1 to 11.8 at P = 700 kPa and from 15.9 to 12.1 at P = 900 kPa with an increase of GHSV from 7500 to 15,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 when no sweep gas was applied, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). At the same time, increasing reaction GHSV results in a decrease of R H . For instance, R H decreased from 58.0% to 38.9% at 500 kPa, from 70.8% to 62.3% at 700 kPa and from 81.3% to 73.7% at 900 kPa, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). Higher reaction GHSV leads to a shorter residence time, which is disadvantageous for the generated H 2 to diffuse from the reaction zone to the Pd membrane interface, and the virtual H 2 pressure drop across the membrane decreased. Therefore, lower Y H and R H are obtained at a higher reaction GHSV. However, a higher GHSV promises a higher H 2 production capacity for the PMR. For instance, when other working conditions were the same, although R H and Y H obtained at GHSV = 15,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 and I = 1.0 were obviously lower than those obtained at GHSV = 7500 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 and I = 1.8, the H 2 production capacity of the PMR was 23.1 m 3 m \u22122 h \u22121 in the former case, still higher than the one of 19.0 m 3 m \u22122 h \u22121 in the latter case. This agrees with the previous results in the methane steam reforming using PMRs. For example, Kikuchi et al. [23] found that increasing reaction GHSV resulted in a decrease of methane conversion, too. Lin et al. [24] predicted the influence of the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) on the methane conversion by simulation. The results also indicated that methane conversion gradually decreases with increasing WHSV. The agreement indicates that owing to the irreversibility of the steam reforming of higher hydrocarbons, the selective removal of H 2 mainly breaks the thermodynamic equilibrium of methane steam reforming and WGS. In this work, as the highly active catalyst [19] and an extended catalyst bed was applied, higher hydrocarbons may be completely converted before entering the following reaction zone in close contact with the Pd membrane. So the results achieved in this work, are comparable with those obtained in the steam reforming of methane in MRs. In this work, a high performance Pd membrane, a highly active steam reforming catalyst combined with a countercurrent sweep gas design, gave a Y H value of 19.0, a R H value of 94.8% and a Y M value of 0.37 at T = 823 K, P = 900 kPa, GHSV = 7500 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 , S/C = 2.70 and I = 1.8. In contrast with the best results obtained in methane steam reforming in PMR [13] , i.e. a methane conversion of 97% was achieved at T = 823 K, P = 500 kPa, GHSV = 800 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 , S/C = 3.0 and I = 10, the GHSV applied in this work was much higher, and the sweep ratio was much lower. These characteristics suggest that the PMR could be operated under working conditions closer to the practical application ones. 3.3.2 Influence of reaction temperature The influence of reaction temperature on Y M and R H were studied at T = 723\u2013823 K, P = 400 or 500 kPa, S/C = 2.7, GHSV = 15,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 and I = 0. Fig. 4 shows the results. It indicates that R H increases, while Y M decreases with an increase in reaction temperature. At 723 K, there was no H 2 detected in the permeate side. The Y M in the PMR was 4.10 at 400 kPa, and 4.12 at 500 kPa. This agrees with the simulation work by Chen et al. [17] , which suggested that at 723 K, the thermodynamic equilibrium of methanation could not be efficiently broken in the n -heptane steam reforming, and H 2 could not be efficiently recovered by the membrane. At T = 773 K, H 2 in the permeate side was detected, but R H was small, with values of 8.0% at P = 400 kPa and 23.3% at P = 500 kPa. The Y M reduced to values of 3.42 at 400 kPa and 3.41 at 500 kPa, respectively; versus thermodynamically controlled ones of 4.02 at 400 kPa, and 4.14 at 500 kPa. The small flux of H 2 across the membrane and low separation efficiency resulted in only a slight decrease of Y M in the PMR. R H increased, while Y M decreased significantly with further increase of reaction temperature to 823 K. For instance, at P = 400 kPa, the R H , Y M obtained in the PMR and the thermodynamically controlled Y M in CFBR were 26.6%, 2.66 and 3.35, respectively. They became 43.0%, 2.32 and 3.50 at P = 500 kPa, respectively. The decrease of Y M in PMR is a result of the thermodynamic equilibrium shift due to the selective removal of H 2 from the reaction zone. Though higher reaction temperatures favor the Y H and R H , further increase is unlikely because: (1) Catalyst deactivation may become a problem under reaction conditions with high R H . In the steam reforming of higher hydrocarbons, when a nickel-based catalyst was applied, the higher the reaction temperature, the higher the critical S/C ratios (a steam-to-carbon feed ratio under which value coke deposition on catalyst takes place). Higher S/C ratios increase the energy consumption, and decrease the energy efficiency of the fuel processor and the membrane separation efficiency. (2) Sintering of the nickel-based catalyst may happen. (3) Higher temperature may degrade the applied Pd membrane. So, the steam reforming of methane or higher hydrocarbons in the PMR was usually investigated in the temperature range of 723\u2013823 K. The above results also suggested that at lower reaction pressures, when no sweep gas was applied, H 2 could not be efficiently recovered due to the limited H 2 permeation driving force. So the optimization of other working conditions was investigated at 823 K. 3.3.3 Influence of steam-to-carbon feed ratios Steam reforming of higher hydrocarbons is usually performed in the presence of an excess of steam to suppress the coke deposition on a nickel-based catalyst. In the industrial steam reforming of naphtha, S/C ratios in the range of 2.0\u20134.0 are applied. So, in this work, the influence of S/C ratios on the Y H , R H and net yield of H 2 ( Y H multiplied by R H ), were investigated at T = 823 K, P = 400 kPa, F C H 4 = 180 \u2009 ml \u2009 mi n \u2212 1 , H 2 /C = 0.1, I = 1.0 and S/C ratios in the range of 2.0\u20133.6. Fig. 5 shows the results. It was found that a higher S/C ratio promoted the H 2 production, but it was not the case with the net yield of H 2 . The lower R H obtained at a higher S/C ratio, was attributed to the fact that H 2 partial pressures in the reaction side and separation efficiency decreased due to the dilution effect of steam. Thus, the net yield of H 2 is a compromise between the enhanced Y H and decreased R H when S/C ratios increased. For instance, Y H increased from 15.2 to 15.9 when the S/C ratio increased from 2.7 to 3.6. However, the net yield of H 2 decreased from 12.16 to 11.59, simultaneously, R H decreased from 80.0% to 72.9%. This agrees with the results reported by Shu et al. [25] , who gave a detailed study of the influence of S/C ratios on the methane conversion in the steam reforming of methane by using Pd/SS or Pd\u2013Ag/SS-based MR. They found that methane conversion increased with increasing S/C ratios. However, the net yield of H 2 showed a non-monotonic relation with S/C ratios. In this work, a net H 2 yield of 12.16 obtained at S/C = 2.7 was the highest one. The results suggest that too large an excess of steam dilutes the H 2 in the products mixture, which results in a decrease of the H 2 partial pressure drop across the membrane and thus in a lower separation efficiency of the membrane. Therefore, in the optimization of S/C ratios, at least two factors should be considered. (1) S/C ratios should be high enough to prevent coke deposition on the catalyst. (2) As Y H increases, while R H decreases with increasing S/C ratios, a compromise should be made between the two opposing factors. Simulation results obtained in CFBMR [21] suggested that it is possible to make the steam reforming of higher hydrocarbons in the PMR coke-free when S/C ratios higher than 2.5 were applied. So, in this work, a S/C ratio of 2.7 was applied and under such conditions, no coke deposition on the catalyst was detected, and high net yield of H 2 was achieved. 3.3.4 Influence of reaction pressure The influence of reaction pressure on the performance of the PMR was investigated widely. In this work, a non-monotonic change of methane yield with reaction pressure was found in the pressure range of 200\u2013900 kPa at T = 823 K. The results presented in Fig. 6 clearly indicate that at higher pressures Y M is effectively decreased when pressure increases, for P = 500\u2013900 kPa and I = 0. In CFBR, Y M increases monotonically from 2.8 to 3.9, when reaction pressure increases from 200 to 900 kPa at 823 K, being controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium. Because 3 mol of H 2 is consumed to produce 1 mol of methane via the methanation reaction, the yield of H 2 deceased quickly due to the methane formation. In the PMR, this trend was firstly kept in the pressure range of 200\u2013400 kPa, being reversed at 500\u2013900 kPa, e.g. methane yield decreased with reaction pressure apparently. The Y M was further reduced by using a countercurrent sweep gas. At lower reaction pressures, the use of sweep gas reduced Y M more efficiently. For example, at T = 823 K, P = 400 kPa, GHSV = 15,000 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 , S/C = 2.7, H 2 /C = 0.1, the Y M was 2.69 at I = 0 and it decreased to 1.88 at I = 1.0; while at P = 900 kPa, the value of Y M was 1.73 at I = 0 and it only slightly decreased to 1.35 at I = 1.0. The Y M values obtained in the PMR are much lower than the thermodynamically controlled ones. In this work, Y H improvement as high as 300%, in comparison with the thermodynamically controlled one was achieved. For instance, at T = 823 K, P = 900 kPa, GHSV = 7500 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 and I = 0, Y M , Y H and R H values were 0.99, 15.9 and 81.3%, respectively. The best results in this work, i.e. Y M of 0.37, Y H of 19.0 and R H of 94.8%, corresponding to a net pure H 2 production of 88.9% of the theoretical maximum H 2 production (supposing 100% selectivity to CO 2 ), were obtained at T = 823 K, P = 900 kPa, GHSV = 7500 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 and I = 1.8, while the thermodynamically controlled Y H is only 4.9. Chen et al. [21] also predicted that Y H increased with increasing reaction pressures for the n -heptane steam reforming in a novel CFBMR, by simulation. The value of 19.34 for Y H was predicted at T = 823 K and P = 1023 kPa. Comparable results were obtained in our work. To sum up, the trend that higher reaction pressures promote Y M instead of Y H in CFBR is reversed by selective H 2 removal from the reaction zone, which makes it feasible to achieve acceptable Y H at higher reaction pressure and at lower temperature, instead of high temperature in the traditional naphtha steam reforming. This eliminates the complex downstream processing of CO and further H 2 purification. H 2 production could be realized using only one highly integrated PMR, which was coupled the highly active steam reforming catalyst and the highly H 2 permeable membrane. 3.3.5 Influence of sweep gas flux Introducing a sweep gas in the permeate side is an efficient method to increase the H 2 partial pressure drop across the membrane, thus promoting the H 2 permeation and improving the R H . When pure H 2 is the desired product, sweep gas types should be chosen carefully. Generally, from a practical application point of view, using steam at a low sweep ratio is acceptable [20] . If the fuel processor is in situ coupled to a fuel cell, using steam as sweep gas, the requirement of H 2 humidification in PEMFC is met. The influence of sweep gas flux on the performance of the MR is also closely related with the MR operation modes: cocurrent or countercurrent [21] . In this work, a H 2 permselective membrane was used under countercurrent operation. The influence of sweep gas flux on Y H and R H was investigated at T = 823 K, P = 400 kPa, GHSV = 7500 ml g \u22121 h \u22121 , S/C = 2.7 and H 2 /C = 0.1, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . A higher sweep gas flux promoted the H 2 production, but this trend became not so obvious at I > 2.0. The results obtained at I = 0 differed much from those obtained at I = 1.0, i.e. Y H values increased from 9.95 to 15.2 and R H values from 41.4% to 75.0%. However, only a slight improvement was obtained with further increase in the sweep ratios from 1.1 to 4.2, i.e. Y H values from 15.2 to 17.0 and R H values from 75.0% to 82.0%, were obtained. In methane steam reforming using PMR, Uemiya et al. [11] , Lin et al. [12] and Gallucci et al. [20] also found that a higher methane conversion could be obtained at a higher sweep ratio, and the increase in methane conversion became less and less at higher sweep ratios. Actually, Shu et al. [25] found that when I > 3.25, no further increase of methane conversion was found. This means that a continuous increase of sweep flux plays only a minor role in enhancing the Y H and R H . Dittmeyer et al. [26] studied the influence of the sweep gas flux on the H 2 permeation in detail. They found that when too large a sweep gas flux is applied, no real improvement of the H 2 permeation flux is observed, even at higher retentate pressures (i.e. high H 2 feed flux). The performances of the PMR are closely related to the working conditions, such as reaction temperature, GHSV, S/C ratio, reaction pressure and sweep gas flux. In this work, from an industrial point of view, H 2 production was investigated under working conditions close to the practical application ones, such as relative high GHSV and low flux of sweep gas, or without sweep gas. It was found that H 2 still could be efficiently produced by using a relatively higher reaction pressure at temperatures lower than 823 K. After reaction for 30 h under various conditions, no degradation of the Pd membrane was observed. The H 2 permeance and the H 2 /N 2 separation coefficient of the membrane showed almost no change. Thus, the process has promising stability and further investigation is under way. 4 Conclusions Back permeation of H 2 in the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons in PMR, has been successfully avoided by using an extended catalyst bed. The yield of methane could be significantly suppressed, while the yield of H 2 efficiently enhanced by the selective removal of H 2 from the reaction through the highly H 2 permeable Pd membrane. Higher reaction temperatures favor the yield of H 2 and H 2 recovery rate in the range of 723\u2013823 K. Increase in the S/C ratios increases the yield of H 2 . However, identical behavior has not been observed for the H 2 recovery rate. The net yield of H 2 is a compromise between the two opposing factors. Optimal S/C ratio was found to be around 2.5. Lower GHSVs favors the yield of H 2 and recovery rate but not the H 2 production capacity of the PMR. Most importantly, the trend that the yield of methane increases with reaction pressures in CFBR is reversed by the selective H 2 removal in PMR, which makes it feasible to achieve a pure H 2 production process using only one MR. In summary, under mild working conditions, a low-emission H 2 production process by the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons in PMR was proposed and successfully demonstrated. This process may find its unique application to small-scale H 2 production using the readily available infrastructure.

        "abstract": "This work found that the CH 4 dissociation on Ni particles is a structure sensitive reaction due to the \u201cmountain\u201d shape of the plot of TOF of CH 4 dissociation versus the Ni particle size in the CH 4 pulse through the Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 . It was also found that E a and ln A are linear dependence on the Ni particle size of Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 and the presence of the compensation effect in the CH 4 dissociation reaction. Abstract The intrinsic kinetic information for the dissociation of CH 4 on the fresh Ni active sites was studied by pulsing CH 4 through Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 catalyst with different Ni particles. After the elimination of the mass and heat transfer, the conversions of CH 4 were controlled far below the values of the thermodynamic equilibrium in order to keep the pulse reaction in the kinetic region. The coverage degree of carbon species on Ni active site is kept less than 1 to eliminate the influence of carbon deposition on the dissociation of CH 4 . The plot of TO F C H 4 versus the Ni particle size exhibits a \u201cmountain\u201d shape. The E a and ln A for the CH 4 dissociation are linearly increased with the increase in the Ni particle size, showing the compensation effect in the CH 4 dissociation. This work reveals that the CH 4 dissociation on fresh Ni active site of Ni particles in Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 catalysts is a structure sensitive reaction. Keywords CH 4 dissociation Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 Pulse kinetic Structure sensitive Compensation effect Ni nano particle 1 Introduction Methane as the major component of natural gas is being widely used for energy source and the production of fine chemicals. The synthesis gas obtained from the reforming reaction of CH 4 with CO 2 or H 2 O can be further used to prepare oxygen-containing organic compounds [1] and highly pure hydrogen [2,3] . The carbon nanotubes and carbon fiber with special properties [4,5] can also be prepared by the dissociation of CH 4 . Due to the cheapness, availability and high activity, Ni metal is considered as one excellent catalyst for CH 4 dissociation [1\u20135] . The study of CH 4 dissociation on Ni-based catalysts has received increasing interest due to its dual roles for science and application. Liao and Zhang [6] calculated the activation energy ( E a ) for CH 4 dissociation on metals Ru, Ir, Rh, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au and noted that Ni metal shows the lowest E a . Other theoretical calculation, such as Hatree method [7] , density function theory (DFT) [8] and ab initio [9] were used to calculate the E a for the CH 4 dissociation on the different crystal plans of Ni metal. The E a of CH 4 dissociation on Ni(1 1 1), Ni(1 0 0) and Ni(1 1 0) has been obtained by experimental methods [10] . Recently, Egeberg et al. [11] obtained the E a of CH 4 dissociation on Ni(1 1 1) as 74 \u00b1 10 kJ/mol through the elimination of the carbon deposition. The present studies on the CH 4 dissociation mainly focus on one crystal plane of Ni metal [6\u201311] , and most of the studies are theory calculation. However, the dissociation of CH 4 on the Ni-based catalysts is actually performed on various crystal planes of Ni particles, containing all the contribution of the various crystal plans of Ni particles. Some experimental methods were also used to study the CH 4 dissociation on the Ni particles for the preparation of hydrogen or filamentous carbon [12\u201316] . This method involves the cumulative dissociation of CH 4 on Ni particles, in which the structure of Ni particles was also reported to change [15] . The carbon species coverage degree on the Ni active sites of catalysts becomes much higher than 1. CH 4 also dissociates on the Ni active sites which have deposited with the carbon species. The cumulative dissociation of CH 4 on Ni active sites does not disclose the intrinsic kinetic information for the single dissociation of CH 4 on the fresh Ni active sites of Ni particles. In order to obtain the intrinsic kinetic information for the CH 4 dissociation on the fresh Ni active sites, the unsteady pulse method was used to investigate the dissociation of CH 4 on the actual catalysts Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 , where the \u03b1-Al 2 O 3 is a classical industrial support [17] . The pulse reaction greatly avoids the cumulative dissociation of CH 4 on Ni active sites and the coverage degree of carbon species on Ni sites was kept less than 1. And the pulse conversions of CH 4 dissociation were much lower than that of the thermodynamic equilibrium, which were controlled by kinetics. The pulse reaction directly gives the information of the intrinsic kinetic of CH 4 dissociation on the fresh Ni active sites of Ni particles in the Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The experiment results show that the turn over frequency of CH 4 dissociation ( TO F C H 4 ) exhibits a \u201cmountain\u201d shape versus the Ni particle sizes in the pulse of CH 4 experiment. Herein, the Ni particles with different nano-scale have influence on the CH 4 dissociation. The obtained E a and ln A of CH 4 dissociation have a good linear dependence on the particle size of Ni. The compensation effect between E a and ln A for the CH 4 dissociation on Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 , results in the \u201cmountain\u201d shape of TO F C H 4 versus Ni nano particle size. This work discloses that the dissociation of CH 4 on Ni particles of Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 catalysts is a structure sensitive reaction and the E a and ln A of CH 4 dissociation are linearly dependence on the Ni particle size. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts and feed gases All the catalysts were prepared by impregnating \u03b1-Al 2 O 3 (2.1 m 2 /g) with stoichiometric aqueous Ni(NO 3 )\u00b76H 2 O for 12 h at room temperature (RT). The loading amount of Ni on the Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 catalysts is 2, 4, 6 and 8 wt%. Then the catalysts were dried at 393 K for 3 h and calcined in air at 1073 K for 6 h. All the catalysts were in situ reduced by highly pure hydrogen at 1123 K for 0.5 h before used for the pulse reaction. CH 4 (99.995% purity), Ar (99.99% purity) and H 2 (99.99% purity) are used as feed gases. 2.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H 2 chemisorption XRD patterns were obtained with a Philips X\u2032 Pert Highscore powder diffractometer (Cu K\u03b1, 20\u00b0 < 2 \u03b8 < 80\u00b0). The particle sizes of Ni can be calculated based on Scherrer equation. The exposed Ni atoms on Ni particles of Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 were measured by H 2 chemisorption at RT by assuming H/Ni atomic ratio of 1. The samples of Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 were reduced at 1123 K for 0.5 h then were decreased to 373 K under Ar and kept for 20 min, then further decreased to RT for in situ H 2 chemisorption measurement. The dispersion degree of Ni can be calculated as the ratio of N 0 /Ni 0 \u00d7 100%, where N 0 is the exposed Ni atoms of per gram catalyst (atom/g cat) and Ni 0 is the total Ni atoms of per gram catalyst (atom/g cat). 2.3 Kinetic study 2.3.1 The elimination of inner and external diffusion A quartz tube with dimension of 6 mm o.d. \u00d7 4 mm i.d. \u00d7 40 cm length was used as reactor. A thermocouple was introduced in the catalyst bed to measure the reaction temperature. The Ar (50 ml/min) carries the CH 4 gas from quantitative tube (0.3058 ml) to the catalyst (5 mg) diluted by 50 mg quartz grain. The reactants and products were analyzed by an on-line GC (Model 103, TCD, carbon sieve as column). The particle sizes of Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 catalysts are 20\u201340, 40\u201360, 60\u2013100, 100\u2013160, 160\u2013200 and 200\u2013300 mesh and the according average grain diameters are 0.765, 0.54, 0.365, 0.175, 0.124 and 0.086 mm, respectively. The decrease in the particles size generally increases the CH 4 dissociation activity. When the activity does not increase with the decreasing of particle size any more, the inner diffusion can be eliminated. The elimination of the external diffusion is carried out as follows. After the elimination of the inner diffusion, the particle size of catalysts is selected as 100\u2013160 mesh. The flow rate of carrier gas is controlled in the range of 25\u201350 ml/min through the catalysts (2\u201310 mg). The carrier gas flow rate is changed to tune the contact time and finally make the activity of the reaction linearly dependence on the contact time. That means the external diffusion is eliminated. 2.3.2 CH 4 pulse reaction A quartz tube with dimension of 6 mm o.d. \u00d7 4 mm i.d. \u00d7 40 cm length was used as the reactor. A thermocouple was introduced to the catalyst bed to measure the reaction temperature. The highly pure Ar (50 ml/min) was pulsed through the quantitative tube (0.3058 ml) to carry the CH 4 through the catalysts (5 mg) diluted with 50 mg quartz grain, which keeps the reforming reaction far away from the thermodynamic equilibrium. The reactants and products were analyzed by an on-line GC (Model 103, TCD, carbon sieve as column) and the conversions (shown in Tables 1 and 2 ) were calculated as follows: (1) Co n pul . % = ( mo l before \u2009 pulse \u2212 mo l after \u2009 pulse ) mo l before \u2009 pulse \u00d7 100 % The coverage degree of carbon species on the catalyst can be calculated according to Eq. (2) : (2) C coverage ( % ) = Con v pul . % V N A 22400 ( N 0 m ) \u00d7 100 % TOF can be calculated according to Eq. (3) : (3) TOF = Co n pul . % ( V N A ) 22400 t ( N 0 m ) where V is the volume of quantitative tube (ml); N A the Avogadro's constant (6.02 \u00d7 10 23 /mol); N 0 the number of active sites per gram catalyst (sites/g cat); m the amount of catalyst (g); TOF the turn over frequency of CH 4 dissociation on one active site per second (times/s); t the contact time ( t = V / S v , s) and S v is the flow rate of carrier gas (ml/s). The activation energy ( E a ) and the pre-exponential factor ( A ) can be obtained by plotting ln TOF versus 1/ T according to the Arrhenius Eq. (4) : (4) ln TOF = ln A \u2212 E a R T + ln V N A 22400 V b N 0 where A is the pre-exponential factor; E a the activation energy (J/mol); R the gas constant 8.314 (J/K); T the pulse temperature (K); V b the preserve volume from the quantitative tube to the entrance of catalyst (ml) and ln( VN A /(22400 V b N 0 )) is constant for every catalyst. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The XRD patterns of four Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 catalysts with different Ni contents are show in Fig. 1 . The peaks at 44.5\u00b0 and 51.9\u00b0 in the XRD patterns of the four catalysts can be, respectively, attributed to Ni(1 1 1) and Ni(2 0 0) crystal planes. The only difference for the four samples is that the peaks intensity is increased with the Ni content. The unchanged location of peaks in the XRD patterns of Ni means the same lattice structure of Ni particles. The average size of Ni crystal particles on Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 can be calculated as 19.1, 31.8, 34.5 and 39.7 nm for the catalysts with the Ni content of 2, 4, 6 and 8% according to Scherrer formula, respectively ( Table 1 ). The active sites of the four catalysts (the amount of exposed Ni atoms) are calculated according to the results of H 2 -chemisorption ( Table 1 ). The decrease in the average particle size increases the amount of the Ni active sites for per gram Ni. The dispersion degrees of Ni for the four catalysts are listed in Table 1 , which are decreased with the increase in the Ni content of catalysts. 3.2 Preparation for the kinetic tests The transfer of mass and heat should be firstly eliminated before the kinetic study for the CH 4 dissociation on the four Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The reaction rates are exponentially increased with the reaction temperature; while the diffusion rates are linearly increased with the reaction temperature. Therefore, higher temperature makes the intrinsic kinetic rate increase faster than the diffusion rate. And the total rate is prone to be controlled by the diffusion at high reaction temperature. Therefore, the highest temperature used for the CH 4 pulse was chosen as the typical temperature to eliminate the diffusion. The inner diffusion is eliminated by adjusting the sizes of catalyst grains (8%Ni as a model). The plot of the conversion of CH 4 versus the size of catalyst grain is shown in Fig. 2 A . It was found that the conversions of CH 4 are increased with the decrease in the size of the catalyst grain. When the grain size of the catalyst is less than 0.175 nm (100\u2013160 mesh), the conversions of CH 4 keep almost unchanged, meaning that the inner diffusion has been eliminated. The elimination of external diffusion can be performed by tuning the contact time of CH 4 gas and the catalyst to make the conversion of CH 4 linearly dependence on the contact time (shown as Fig. 2 B). The contact time can be tuned by changing the flow rate of carrier gas. It was found that the conversions of CH 4 become linear with the contact time when the contact time is less than 0.51 s. Meanwhile, the conversions of CH 4 are far away from the values of the thermodynamic equilibrium. The further increase in the contact time results in the departure of the conversion from the line. Therefore, the external diffusion can be eliminated with the contact time less than 0.51 s ( Fig. 2 B). The conversion of CH 4 can be controlled by tuning the amount of catalyst and the flow rate of carrier gas in order to keep the temperature fluctuation of the catalyst bed within 0.5 K during the CH 4 pulse reaction. Then the heat transfer can be basically eliminated and the influence of the reaction heat on the catalytic reaction can be neglected. 3.3 Kinetic of CH 4 dissociation The durative dissociation of CH 4 on the metal Ni sites generates the coke on the catalysts. Then the unsteady pulse experiments were carried out to avoid the deposition of carbon on Ni active sites, which greatly reduces the influence of carbon species on the CH 4 dissociation. And the pulse reactions directly display the catalytic properties on the fresh Ni active sites of the Ni particles. The conversions of thermodynamic equilibrium at 748, 773, 798 and 823 K (Con equ. %) are respectively calculated and listed in Table 2 . The pulse conversions of CH 4 (Con pul. %) on each catalyst at the different pulse temperature can be obtained by Eq. (1) and listed in Table 2 . Notably, all the ratios of Con pul. %/Con equ. % at each temperature are lower than 20% and the pulse reactions are far away from the thermodynamic equilibrium. The amount of the CH 4 dissociated on the Ni catalysts can be calculated based on the conversions of the CH 4 pulse (Con pul. %). And the coverage degree of carbon species on the Ni active sites (C coverage %) can be calculated according to Eq. (2) and listed in Table 2 . The values of C coverage % at different temperature are all less than 1, meaning that the dissociation of CH 4 is mainly carried out on the fresh Ni active sites and the influence of the carbon deposition on the CH 4 dissociation can be neglected. Therefore, the pulse reactions give the intrinsic kinetic information of the CH 4 dissociation on the fresh Ni active sites of the Ni particles. The TO F C H 4 for the pulse reaction on per Ni active site at different reaction temperature can be calculated according to Eq. (3) and listed in Table 2 . The TO F C H 4 was found to increase with the increase in the pulse temperature for every catalyst. And it should be noted that the TO F C H 4 obtained for the Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 with different loading amount of Ni is not the same at the same pulse temperature. The different loading of Ni on Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 results in the different Ni particle sizes. Therefore, the TO F C H 4 should be related with the Ni nano particles with different sizes. The relationship between the TO F C H 4 and particle sizes of Ni on four catalysts at every pulse temperature is shown in Fig. 3 . The increase in the nano-scale of Ni particles from 19.1 to 31.8 nm increases the TO F C H 4 , and the further increasing the particle sizes decreases the TO F C H 4 . The highest TO F C H 4 was obtained for the catalyst with Ni particle size of 31.8 nm at each pulse temperature. The plots of TO F C H 4 versus particle size of Ni at each temperature show \u201cmountain\u201d shapes in Fig. 3 . It has been reported that one reaction can be defined as a structure sensitive reaction when the reaction activity (TOF) is changed with the metal particle size [18,19] . For example [20] , the CO hydrogenation reaction on Rh catalyst is a structure sensitive reaction because the TOF for the hydrogenation of CO is varied with the particle sizes of Rh on Rh/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Recently, Lu et al. [21] found that ethylene epoxidation on Ag catalyst is a structure sensitive reaction since the bigger Ag particles produce higher epoxidation activity. The \u201cmountain\u201d shapes of TO F C H 4 versus the Ni particle size provide the direct evidence for the structure sensitive reaction of CH 4 dissociation on Ni catalyst. The pulse reaction is performed in the kinetic region and the E a and A further elucidate the influence of the Ni particle sizes on the TO F C H 4 of CH 4 dissociation. The plots of ln TO F C H 4 versus 1/ T according to Eq. (4) for every catalyst are shown in Fig. 4 . These plots show good linear relationship for every catalyst. Then E a and A for the CH 4 dissociation on every catalyst can be calculated based on Fig. 4 according to Arrhenius formula and listed in Table 3 . The E a for CH 4 dissociation on the four catalyst is 2%Ni (73.2 kJ/mol) < 4%Ni (83.5 kJ/mol) < 6%Ni (86.1 kJ/mol) < 8%Ni (90.9 kJ/mol). The pre-exponential factor A for CH 4 dissociation on each catalyst is: 2%Ni (0.18 \u00d7 10 7 ) < 4%Ni (1.50 \u00d7 10 7 ) < 6%Ni (2.25 \u00d7 10 7 ) < 8%Ni (6.12 \u00d7 10 7 ). Both the E a and A of CH 4 dissociation are increased with the increase in the Ni particle size. Then plot of E a versus the Ni nano-scale particles shows a good linear relationship with the correlated coefficient R 2 of 0.9985 ( Fig. 5 ). And ln A is also well linear versus the Ni particle size with the correlated coefficient R 2 of 0.9988 ( Fig. 6 ). The increase in the sizes of Ni nano particles linearly increases the E a and ln A , which further confirms that the CH 4 dissociation reaction on Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 catalyst is a structure sensitive reaction from the viewpoint of the kinetics. It has been reported [22] that the nickel particles with difference size have the different type of lattice planes exposed. Both the theory calculation and experiment results [7\u20139] show that the dissociation of CH 4 on the different crystal plans of Ni metal gives the different activation energy. Burghgraef et al. [23] calculated based on the electron structure of Ni that the activation energy of CH 4 dissociation is increased with the increase in the atoms number of Ni particle: that the E a of CH 4 dissociation on one Ni atom is 40.7 kJ mol \u22121 and the E a on Ni 13 particle is increase to 99.7 kJ mol \u22121 . These results may be used to explain that the E a for the CH 4 dissociation was changed with the different Ni particle size. The general equation for the compensation effect [24,25] is shown below: (5) A = A 0 \u2061 exp ( c E a ) \u2003 or \u2003 ln A = c E a + ln A 0 where A 0 and c are two constants. The plot of ln A versus E a obtained from the CH 4 dissociation on the different Ni particles is shown in Fig. 7 . It is worth noted that the ln A is well linear with the E a for the CH 4 pulse dissociation reaction and the correlation coefficient R 2 is up to 0.9991. E a and ln A are linearly increased with the increase in the Ni particle size. The compensation effect is proved to be present in the CH 4 pulse dissociation on Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, which further indicates that the kinetic parameters obtained here are correlated with the intrinsic kinetic properties of the fresh Ni active sites. The compensation effect of E a and A results in the \u201cmountain\u201d shape of the plots of TO F C H 4 versus Ni particle sizes in Fig. 3 . This work proves that the CH 4 dissociation on Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 is a structure sensitive reaction based on the linear relationship of E a and ln A with Ni particle size. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, the pulse of CH 4 through Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 with different Ni particle sizes gives the intrinsic kinetic information of the single dissociation of CH 4 on the fresh Ni active sites of the Ni particles. The plots of the TO F C H 4 versus Ni particle size show a \u201cmountain\u201d shape at each pulse temperature. The dissociation of CH 4 on Ni catalyst is proved to be a structure sensitive reaction. E a and ln A obtained from the intrinsic kinetic of the CH 4 dissociation were found to linearly increase with the Ni particle size. The ln A is well linear with the E a for the CH 4 pulse reaction and the compensation effect of E a and A is present in the CH 4 dissociation on Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 . This work proves that the CH 4 dissociation on Ni/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3 is a structure sensitive reaction based on the linear relationship of E a and ln A with Ni particle size.

In these unsteady pulse reactions, the carbon species coverage on the catalysts was kept less than 100% and the information about methane dissociation on the fresh Ni active sites was disclosed. Kinetic parameters for the methane dissociation over these catalysts were obtained under reaction conditions free from heat and mass transfer limitations. The methane dissociation activation energy ( E a ) on catalysts A, A-L, M, and M-L is 90.9, 111.8, 79.5, and 85.9 kJ/mol, respectively. The E a values on catalysts M and M-L are lower than those on catalysts A and A-L. The La 2 O 3 promoter increases the E a of methane dissociation. There is a compensation effect between the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor in the methane dissociation on the Ni-based catalysts, which reduces the influence of the supports and promoter on the methane dissociation.",

        "abstract": "The Ni/ La 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 catalyst prepared by a coprecipitation method was used for hydrogen production from steam reforming of higher hydrocarbons in a palladium membrane reactor. The catalyst was characterized by low-temperature N 2 physical adsorption, H 2 temperature-programmed reduction, H 2 -O 2 chemisorption, and X-ray diffraction. The results showed that there was strong interaction between NiO and the support. Compared with the conventional fixed-bed reactor, the yield of H 2 increased significantly and the formation of methane was suppressed in the Pd membrane reactor because of the selective removal of H 2 by the membrane. Even under the near-practical application conditions, e.g., high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and small flux of sweep gas, the high yield of H 2 and the high membrane separation efficiency were still achieved. Furthermore, no degradation of the membrane was observed even under working conditions of 823 K and steam-to-carbon feed ratio of 2.7. This suggested that it was feasible to realize H 2 production from steam reforming of higher hydrocarbons using only one reactor and one nickel-based reforming catalyst at reaction temperatures lower than 823 K.",

The La2O3-promoted catalysts increased the conversion of CH4 and the selectivity for H2. The La2O3 additive could decrease the intensity of diffraction peak of Ni(111) crystal face of the reduced catalyst, which makes its structure suitable for CH4 activation. The selectivity of the catalyst modified by CeO2 for CO was higher than that by La2O3.",

        "abstract": "A series of Pt-based catalysts supported on ZSM-5-ZSM-11-Al2O3 were prepared and applied to aromatization of fluid catalytic cracking gasoline to benzene,toluene and xylene(BTX) in a fixed bed reactor. It was found that the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst could be improved through introduction of ZSM-5-ZSM-11 zeolite to PtSn/Al2O3. Under the reaction conditions of PtSnZn/ZSM-5-ZSM-11-Al2O3 as catalyst,460-560 \u2103,0.4 MPa,WHSV 0.3 h-1 and V(H2):V(Oil) 100,BTX mass fraction in C+5 liquid products increased from 47.1% to 63.1%,which was much better than that over industrial PS-\u2165 catalyst. NH3-TPD measurement indicated that the ZSM-5-ZSM-11 zeolite could provide stable acid sites which were necessary for the aromatization. At the same time little activity loss was found on the PtSnZn/ZSM-5-ZSM-11-Al2O3 catalyst even after regeneration 10 times. TG and O2-TPO analyses revealed that amount of the carbonaceous deposit on the Pt-Sn-Zn/ZSM-5-ZSM-11-Al2O3 was lower than that on PS-\u2165,which could lead to the higher catalyst stability.",

In these unsteady pulse reactions, the carbon species coverage on the catalysts was kept less than 100% and the information about CH_4 dissociation on the fresh Ni active sites was disclosed. Kinetic parameters for the CH_4 dissociation over these catalysts were obtained under reaction conditions free from heat and mass transfer limitations. The CH_4 dissociation activation energy (E_a) on catalysts A, A-L, M, and M-L is 90.9, 111.8, 79.5, and 85.9 kJ/mol, respectively. The E_a values on catalysts M and M-L are lower than those on catalysts A and A-L. The La_2O_3 promoter increases the E_a of CH_4 dissociation. There is a compensation effect between the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor in the CH_4 dissociation on the Ni-based catalysts, which reduces the influence of the supports and promoter on the CH_4 dissociation.",

        "abstract": "When it comes to a single-phase flow in the strata, the permeability in binomial coefficients A and B of binomial deliverability equation for a gas well stands for formation permeability, but when it comes to a gas-water two-phase flow, it turns to be gas phase permeability. Based on the deliverability equation established upon the steady seepage theory of gas underground, and in the absence of deliverability test data for a gas well, this paper presented a new method of determining inflow performance relationship of water-producing gas wells by using dynamic production parameters of water-producing wells. This new method mainly includes the following contents: First, the corresponding bottomhole flowing pressure is determined according to the gas & water flowing pressure calculation method of a vertical pipe and dynamic parameters of a water-producing gas well. Second, the corresponding gas permeability is determined according to transient well test results while non-water-producing at the preliminary stage in combination with dynamic production parameters and pressure data at the current stage. Finally, the inflow performance relationship of a water-producing gas well is determined according to the calculated gas permeability and binomial deliverability equation for a water-producing gas well. This method was put into practice for the calculation of a water-producing well, and the binomial deliverability equations were obtained for a gas well with and without water production respectively. The calculation results show that when there is water produced in a gas well, the coefficients A and B in the binomial deliverability equation for the well are made greater and its open flow capacity is remarkably reduced. This study provides a new idea for determining the deliverability equation of a water-producing gas well.",

Another 126 controls were randomly selected from hospital staff of non-autoimmune diseases and healthy individuals. Toll like receptor (TLR) 3 and TLR 9 genotypes were determined by PCR and digested by specific restriction enzymes.There was significant difference in genotype and allele distribution of TLR3c.1377 polymorphism between the MS patients and the controls (P<0.05), and the MS patients with T allele had a lower risk (OR=0.532, P=0.014). There was no significant difference in genotypes and allele distribution of TLR9-1486 polymorphism between the MS patients and the controls. There was higher TLR9 2848 A allele frequency in the MS patients than in the controls (39.8% vs. 30.6%;P=0.037), and higher risk in MS patients with A allele than those without (OR=1.837, P=0.020). There was no significant interaction among the TLR3c.1377, TLR9-1486 and TLR9 2848 allele. Strong linkage disequilibrium was found between TLR9-1486 and TLR9 2848, but there was no significant interaction between the polymorphism of TLR9-1486 and TLR9 2848 in the MS patients.TLR3c.1377 and TLR9 2848 polymorphisms may be related to MS in Han people in south China.

Male Lewis rats were immunized with the component of PNS myelin sheath protein P0 180-199 (100 mg) and Freund's complete adjuvant. The immunized rats were administrated intragastrically with TWP daily till death. The clinical signs of rats and pathological changes in the sciatic nerves of rats were observed. The rats of the immunized group and the control group were sacrificed 7 days, 16 days, 24 days, 33 days after former being immunized. The paraffin sections of embed sciatic nerves were made, which were stained by HE stain and Weil's stain to observe the histopathology. TLR9 was detected by RT-PCR dynamically, as from spleens, sciatic nerves, peripheral blood and lymphonodes. The results show that the mRNA expression of TLR9 is up -regulated during the whole process of the experiment in EAN group, and is higher than that of the control group. There is a difference of significance between the two neighboring points, with P<0.05. The expression of TLR9 mRNA in EAN + TWP group is lower than that of EAN + NS group (P<0.05). TWP relieves the clinical signs of EAN. In summary, the data show for the first time that TLR9 may play a role in the pathogenesis of EAN in its inducing stage and effecting stage. TWP may ameliorate the EAN through inhabiting the TLR9 activation.",

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells\u20111 (TREM\u20111) is an important receptor involved in sepsis and the innate inflammatory response. Linear plasmid\u00a017 (LP\u00a017) peptide is a competitive antagonist of TREM\u20111. To investigate the role of TREM\u20111 in EAN, 64\u00a0male Lewis rats were randomly divided into four groups: Normal saline, complete Freund's adjuvant, EAN and LP\u00a017. The present study assessed the mRNA expression levels of TREM\u20111, tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 and interleukin\u20111\u03b2 in sciatic nerves and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results demonstrated that inhibiting TREM-1 by administering LP\u00a017 ameliorated symptoms and reduced inflammation in EAN rats.

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the pathological mechanism of brain function and structure in young patients with major depressive disorder by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: Sixteen participants diagnosed with major depression (MD) and 16 healthy age and gender-matched controls (HC) were recruited. Resting state fMRI and DTI brain scans were performed on all participants. A voxel-based method (VBM) was used to analyze the DTI datasets, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach was applied to preprocess the fMRI datasets. The value of fractional anisotropy (FA) and ReHo maps were obtained in the whole brain. Results: FA values in the MD group were significantly lower than those of the healthy controls in the white matter of the left middle temporal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, left angular gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, right sub-gyral, left insula, and left pyramis (P <0.01) . ReHo in the MD group decreased in the left superior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, left paracentral lobule, right paracentral lobule, right inferior parietal lobule, left postcentral gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, left lingual gyrus, right putamen, right cingulate gyrus, right cuneus, left superior temporal gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus (P <0.01) . Conclusion: Abnormality of brain white microstructure and function exist widely in young patients with major depressive disorder. Abnormal connection of structures and function between the brain areas may be the key reason for the depression.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To determine the role of miR-155 in the pathogenesis of generalized myasthenia gravis (GMG) and the effect of dexamethasone (DXM) on miR-155. Methods: The expression of miR-155 in B cells from the GMG patients and healthy controls was analyzed by qPCR. The B cells were cultured with DXM and PBS. The B cell proliferation was examined by MTT; CD80 and CD86 frequencies were detected by flow cytometry; and anti-AChR-IgG and isotypes anti-AChR-IgG 1,2, 3 in the supernatant were detected by ELISA. Results: qPCR revealed that the expression of miR-155 in the B cells was much higher than that in the controls, and the miR155 expression decreased after DXM treatment. Flow cytometry showed that there was no significant difference in the proliferation and the expressions of CD80 and CD86 in the B cells between the DXM group and the PBS group. The concentration of anti-AChR-IgG 1 was obviously lower in the DXM group than in the PBS group, but the concentration of anti-AChR-IgG, anti-AChR-IgG2, and anti-AchR-IgG3 was similar. Conclusion: High expression of miR-155 may be associated with myasthenia gravis progression. DXM may disturb the antibody class switch of B cells by suppressing the expression of miR-155 and improve the symptom of MG patients.",

We have investigated the effects of fracture structure on wave propagation in interlayered carbonate and shale rocks using physical models based on wave theory and the similarity principle. We have designed and built two sets of layered physical models with randomly embedded predesigned vertically aligned fractures according to the control variate principle. We have measured the P- and S-wave velocities and attenuation and analyzed the effects of fracture porosity and aspect ratio (AR) on velocity, attenuation, and power spectral dimension of the P- and S-waves.

In view of this, and on the basis of difficulty analysis, killing fluid system optimization as well as construction programdesign, in this paper comprehensive research is conducted on the systematic technology for gas production test while ensuring wellcontrol safety. So gas production test technology is developed, which is applicable to shallow (extreme shallow) gas layer in DagangOilfield. The key should be focused on first-order well control in shallow gas layer. After the gas layer is perforated, the stability in gaslayer must be maintained before kicking well off operation, thereby, to effectively minimize such hazards in well control as overflow.This technology, with favorable field application prospect, is a reference for gas production test operation in similar gas wells.",

Results showed that the nirK-type denitrifying bacteria community structure was significantly affected by fertilization regimes, especially for 70, 156 and 190 bp T-RFs that represented the dominant populations in greenhouse soil. Fertilization regimes significantly influenced the abundance of nirK gene in the 0-20 cm soil layer with the highest abundance of nirK gene copy number (2.16 x 10(7) copies x g(-1) soil) detected in the manure treatment (M), which was 2.04 and 2.02 times of that in the control (CK) and chemical fertilizer (NPK) treatments, respectively. Both the dominant population and abundance of nirK-type denitrifying bacteria in the greenhouse soil were significantly different between the 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers, and the nirK-type denitrifying bacteria community structure and abundance in the greenhouse soil were obviously different from that in the field. Soil pH, soil organic matter content and nitrate-N content had the greatest influence on the bacterial community composition. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that there were not only anaerobic nirK-type denitrifying bacteria in greenhouse soil, but also aerobic denitrifying bacteria, such as Rhizobium, Ochrobactrum, Agrobacterium.",

The results showed that the dominant population structure and abundance of bacteria, AOB, nirK type denitrifying bacteria in the soils were significantly different from those in the farmland fields. The dominant population also changed with the cultivation years. With the increase of vegetable cultivation years, the abundance of 16S rRNA and nirK gene in the 0-20 cm soil layer first increased and then decreased, with the maximum values of 9.67 x 10(9) and 2.30 x 10(7) copies x g(-1) soil at year 14 and year 9, being as 1.51 and 1.52 times of that of the 3-year, respectively. However, the abundance of amoA gene showed an opposite trend. The amoA gene copy number in the 14-year sample was 3.28 x 10(7) copies x g(-1) soil, which was only 45.7% of that of the 3-year. These results illustrated that the ecological adaptation mechanisms of the different functional microorganisms involved in nitrogen cycling had significant differences in the facility vegetable soils, and provided a base for further researches on exploring and explaining the characteristics and adaptation mechanisms of microorganisms in greenhouse soil.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and functional role of miR-181c in myasthenia gravis (MG). miR-181c showed significant downregulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from MG patients compared with healthy controls, with lower expression in generalized patients than in ocular ones. MG patients also had increased serum IL-7 and IL-17 levels. Additionally, serum IL-7 level presents a positive correlation with the serum IL-17 level. miR-181c levels were negatively correlated with serum levels of IL-7 and IL-17 in either generalized patients or ocular patients. A luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-181c could directly bind to the 3'-UTR of interleukin-7. Forced expression of miR-181c led to decreased IL-7 and IL-17 release in cultured PBMCs, while depletion of miR-181c increased the secretion of these two proinflammatory cytokines. The results from our study suggested for the first time that miR-181c was able to negatively regulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-7 and IL-17 in MG patients, and it is a novel potential therapeutic target for MG.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Th17-related cytokines have been suggested to play a crucial role in myasthenia gravis (MG) pathogenesis.The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-induced protein 8-like-2 (TNFAIP8L2 or TIPE2), is a newly identified member of the tumor necrosis TNFAIP8 family which is an essential negative regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity. In the present study, the expression of TIPE2 mRNA and protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy and MG subjects were detected by Real-time PCR and Western blotting.The serum IL-6, IL-17 and IL-21 levels were tested by ELISA. Furthermore, PBMC from MG patients were purified and stimulated with LPS (TLR4 agonist) with or without transfection of TIPE2 expressing adenovirus, then the expression of TIPE2 and Th17-specific transcriptional factor ROR\u03b3t and the IL-6, IL-17 and IL-21 levels of supernatant were analized. Our data demonstrated that the expression of TIPE2 mRNA and protein was reduced in MG compared with normal controls, with lower expression in generalized patients than in ocular ones. Furthermore, TIPE2 mRNA presents a significantly negative correlation with the serum levels of IL-6, IL-17 and IL-21 in either generalized patients or ocular patients. In cultured MG PBMC, TLR4 activation led to the down-regulation of TIPE2, while the expression of ROR\u03b3t and production of IL-6, IL-17 and IL-21 were significantly increased. However, when TIPE2 was overexpressed, these TLR4 activation-induced effects were significantly abrogated. Overall, our results indicated for the first time that TIPE2 may participate in the development of MG through negatively regulation of TLR4-mediated autoimmune T helper 17 cell responses.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that play critical roles in the process of various diseases. The miRNAs in GBS were less studied. In this study, using microarray technology, we found two miRNAs including has-miR-4717-5p and has-miR-642b-5p were upregulated in patients with GBS, which were further confirmed by PCR analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis suggested that the dysregulated miRNAs may be involved in the mechanism of GBS by affecting the cellular differentiation, cell survival and axonal outgrowth.",

Strategies to remove the pathogenic autoantibodies or block the complement deposition benefit most patients with GBS. Immunoglobulin G-degrading enzyme of  Streptococcus pyogenes  (IdeS) is a cysteine protease which cleaves IgG antibodies into F(ab\u2032) 2  and Fc fragments. In this study, using a rabbit model of axonal GBS, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), we demonstrated that IdeS treatment significantly reduced the disruption of Nav channels as well as activated C3 deposition at the anterior spinal root nodes of Ranvier in AMAN rabbits. IdeS significantly promoted the clinical recovery of AMAN rabbits and there were significant lower frequencies of axonal degeneration in anterior spinal roots of AMAN rabbits with IdeS treatment compared to the saline controls. Our data support that IdeS treatment is a promising therapeutic strategy for GBS.",

        "abstract": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exert dual roles in immune responses through inducing inflammation and maintaining immune tolerance. A switch of pDC phenotype from pro-inflammation to tolerance has therapeutic promise in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Vinpocetine, a vasoactive vinca alkaloid extracted from the periwinkle plant, has recently emerged as an immunomodulatory agent. In this study, we evaluated the effect of vinpocetine on phenotype of pDCs isolated from C57BL/6 mice and explored its possible mechanism. Our data showed that vinpocetine significantly downregulated the expression of CD40, CD80, and CD86 on pDCs and increased the expression of translocator protein (TSPO), the specific receptor of vinpocetine, in pDCs. Vinpocetine significantly inhibited the Toll-like receptor 9 signaling pathway and reduced the secretion of related cytokines in pDCs through TSPO. Furthermore, viability of pDCs was significantly promoted by vinpocetine. These findings imply that vinpocetine serves as an immunomodulatory agent for pDCs and may be applied for the treatment of pDCs-related autoimmune diseases.",

The relationship between electrospinning parameters (such as voltage, concentration, and feeding rate) and the fiber diameters has been investigated. The characterizations for the structure and morphology of electrospun membranes were carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), (1)H NMR, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The hydrophilicity of the membrane was determined by contact angle measurements in bi-distilled water, and it was shown that the hydrophilicity of the copolymer could be adjusted by the content of the poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) segment in the copolymer. The results of in vitro degradation study showed that the submicrostructure of the fibrous membrane and the incorporation of hydrophilic PEG into PLA block could accelerate the degradation of the membrane in regards to the changes of inherent viscosity, tensile strength, and weight loss.",

PELA membranes with smooth surfaces and no bead defects were electrospun from polymer solutions containing 20% (w/v) PELA in 8:2 N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF)/acetone. The morphology of the drug-loaded electrospun membranes was influenced by electrospinning parameters such as the flow rate and voltages during preparation. Metronidazole could be released from the electrospun membranes and was characterized by an initial burst effect. Higher voltages led to faster release rates, while an increase in the flow rate decreased the drug release. The incorporation of metronidazole into the electrospun membranes decreased their surface hydrophilicity. The amount of drug released from the electrospun membranes was effective in inhibiting microbial growth. Cell adhesion on the PELA membranes with or without drug was less than that on the homo-polymeric PDLLA membranes. Proliferation of L929 mouse fibroblasts on the PELA membranes was observed. This study confirms the potential of metronidazole-loaded PELA biodegradable electrospun membranes for optimizing the clinical therapy of post-surgical adhesions and infections.",

The synthesized copolymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. PELA membrane was prepared by electrospun. The prepared copolymer membranes were more flexible than the control poly-d-l-lactic acid (PDLLA) membrane, as investigated by the measurements of glass transition temperature. Its biocompatibility and anti-adhesion capabilities were also evaluated. In vitro cell adhesions on the PELA copolymer membrane and PDLLA membrane were compared by the culture of mouse fibroblasts L929 on the surfaces. For in vivo evaluation of tissue anti-adhesion potential, the PDLLA and PELA copolymer membranes were implanted between cecum and peritoneal wall defects of rats and their tissue adhesion extents were compared. It was observed that the PELA copolymer membrane was very effective in preventing cell or tissue adhesion on the membrane surface, probably owing to the effects of hydrophilic polyethylene glycol.",

A large number of diatoms were lost by removing the supernatant after centrifugation in the conventional forensic diatom test. We developed a novel membrane filtration method to enrich diatoms from samples. A new solution using different ratios of acetic acid and eugenol is prepared to make the membrane transparent. These processes allow the diatom-containing membrane to be visualized and identified easily by light microscopy. The tissues contaminated by water rich in diatoms were detected by the new method for the recovery of diatoms. Eleven drowning cases were analyzed by both the new method and the conventional method to compare the sensitivity of both methods. The recovery of the novel diatom test method was 54.2 \u00b1 23.1%. The positive rate of the novel method has been proven to be superior to the conventional method in the diagnosis of drowning.",

In particular, the equilibrium conversion of isobutylene under various reaction conditions close to those used in industry was calculated and discussed. Isobutylene amination is a temperature sensitive reaction due to its exothermic nature and isobutylene equilibrium conver-sion decreases with temperature. However, kinetically, the amination reaction will be faster at a higher temperature. Thus, there must be an optimum temperature for the reaction. A high pressure and  n (NH 3 )/ n (i-C 4 H 8 ) molar ratio promote the transformation of isobutylene to tert-butylamine. Developing a highly efficient catalyst under mild reaction conditions is preferred for the amination process. The reaction was investigated over a series of acidic zeolites. ZSM-11 zeolite exhibited the best performance with 14.2% isobutylene conversion (52.2% of the equilibrium conversion) and u003e 99.0% tert-butylamine selectivity. The effect of reaction conditions on the performance of the ZSM-11 catalyst agreed with the thermodynamic results, which provides guidance for further cata-lyst development and reaction condition optimization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The atomically economic and green chemical reaction of direct amination of isobutylene to tert-butylamine, particularly under the relative mild reaction conditions available for future industrial use, was carried out over zeolite catalysts possessing different topological structures, from one dimensional to three dimensional pore system, and from small 8-member ring pore (MRP) to medium 10 MRP and further to large 12 MRP zeolites, to disclose the relationship between the zeolite properties/topologies and their amination performance systematically under the mild reaction conditions. It was discovered that the pore structure and the acidities of zeolite catalysts played crucial roles in the isobutylene amination process, and suitable pore diameter (larger than 0.5\u00a0nm or with large side pockets/cups in the outside surface) and a certain number of mid-strong acid sites are indispensable to catalyze the amination reaction, while too strong acid strength was not conducive to the process of isobutylene amination. Among them, zeolites with topologies of BEA, MFI, MEL, MWW and EUO exhibited good amination performance, with which the isobutylene conversion was higher than 12.61% (u003e46.42% of the equilibrium conversion) under the studied mild reaction conditions. Due to the good amination performance and the large adjustable Si/Al 2  ratio range, ZSM-5 was selected to further study the effect of acidity on the amination performance systematically under the mild reaction conditions, and the activity-acidity relationship in the amination process was disclosed: the amination activity (isobutylene conversion) had a linear correlation with the amount of mid-strong B acidity under the studied conditions over ZSM-5 catalyst, which can provide guidance for further developing high-efficient amination catalyst under mild reaction conditions available for future industrial use.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A novel route involving self-metathesis of 1-butene under mild conditions that gave high yields of ethene and hexene was proposed. The results of thermodynamic analysis revealed that the Gibbs energy of the target Metathesis I reaction (1-butene \u2192 ethene + 3-hexene) was much higher than that of the main side Metathesis II (1-butene + 2-butene \u2192 propene + 2-pentene). Suppression of 1-butene double-bond isomerization was the key step to increase the selectivity for the target olefin in the reaction network. The relationship between the catalytic performance and support nature was investigated in detail. On basis of H 2 -TPR, UV-Vis spectra and HRTEM results, an alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) support with large surface area was beneficial for the dispersion of molybdenum (Mo) species. Both suitable acidity and sufficient Mo dispersion were important to selectively promote the self-metathesis reaction of 1-butene. On the optimal 6Mo/Al 2 O 3  catalyst, 1-butene conversion reached 47% and ethene selectivity was as high as 42% on the premise of good catalytic stability (80 \u00b0C, 1.0 MPa, 3 h \u22121 ).",

        "abstract": "Sulfatide is a major glycosphingolipid in myelin and a target for autoantibodies in autoimmune neuropathies. However neuropathy disease models have not been widely established, in part because currently available monoclonal antibodies to sulfatide may not represent the diversity of anti-sulfatide antibody binding patterns found in neuropathy patients. We sought to address this issue by generating and characterising a panel of new anti-sulfatide monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies have sulfatide reactivity distinct from existing antibodies in assays and in binding to peripheral nerve tissues and can be used to provide insights into the pathophysiological roles of anti-sulfatide antibodies in demyelinating neuropathies.",
