An observer study was performed by five radiologists. The observer performances in differentiating malignant from benign coexisting small nodules were evaluated on conventional CT and HRCT using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.The area under the ROC curve of five observers was 0.731 on HRCT and 0.578 on conventional CT in the differential diagnosis of coexisting small nodules. A significant diagnostic improvement was found on HRCT (p=0.031). This was especially evident for nodules of ground-glass attenuation (p=0.005).HRCT plays an important role in determining the treatment of potentially operable lung cancer patients with coexisting small nodules.",

Lung parenchymal abnormalities that were evaluated included airspace consolidation, ground-glass attenuation, nodules, bronchiectasis, and air trapping.On CT, ground-glass attenuation and nodules were the most frequent findings, observed in 60% (n = 18/30) and 83% (n = 25/30), respectively. Three major CT patterns were identified: airway disease (n = 13), nodules (n = 8), and parenchymal opacification (n = 6). All 13 patients with airway disease showed centrilobular opacities. One patient with peribronchial nodules showed lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, and 1 with randomly distributed nodules showed noncaseating granulomas. Patients with a CT pattern of parenchymal opacification showed lower lung predominance; surgical biopsies showed organizing pneumonia in 1 patient and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia with nonnecrotizing granulomas in another.Common variable immunodeficiency is associated with 3 major CT patterns: airway disease, nodules, and parenchymal opacification.",

        "abstract": "To clarify the difference of (18)F-FDG uptake kinetics between FDG-avid metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FDG-avid benign LNs associated with various etiologies on dual-time point PET/CT scan, and to determine the optimal parameter for differentiation.The subjects were 134 FDG-avid metastatic LNs in 67 patients with NSCLC and 62 FDG-avid benign LNs in 61 patients with various lung disorders including NSCLC. PET/CT scan was performed at 2 time points (at 60 min and at 120 min) after intravenous injection of 4.4 MBq/kg (18)F-FDG. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on early and delayed scans and the percent change of SUVmax (%DeltaSUVmax) were measured at each FDG-avid LN. The optimal parameter for differentiation was determined by the receiver-operating characteristic analysis.Delayed SUVmax was increased compared with early SUVmax in 114 (85.0%) FDG-avid metastatic LNs and 42 (67.7%) FDG-avid benign LNs, with significant higher delayed SUVmax than early values (7.0 +/- 5.0 vs. 5.9 +/- 3.4; P < 0.0001, and 3.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 2.8 +/- 1.0; P < 0.05, respectively). Early and delayed SUVmax and %DeltaSUVmax in metastatic LNs were significantly higher than those in benign LNs (P < 0.0001). The optimal parameter for the differentiation was the combined use of early SUVmax > 3.0 or delayed SUVmax > 4.0, yielding sensitivity of 88.8%, specificity of 80.6%, accuracy of 86.2%, negative predictive value of 76.9%, and positive predictive value of 90.6%. It provided better results than the use of early SUVmax > 3.0 alone (P = 0.019) or the optimal parameter for %DeltaSUVmax (>5%) (P = 0.012). However, 12 (19.3%) benign LNs were indistinguishable from metastatic LNs.Although dual-time point PET/CT scan enhances the difference of FDG uptake between FDG-avid metastatic and benign LNs and improves the differentiation when compared with a single scan, biopsy procedure may be still required for accurate assessment of LN status in patients with NSCLC and possible etiologies showing intensive FDG uptake in benign LNs.",

        "abstract": "Major lung resection may induce expansion of the remaining lung, accompanied by some gain in the function of this lung; however, the impact of the site of resection on this compensatory response remains unclear.We measured computed tomography-based functional lung volume, representing normal lung attenuation (-600 to -910 Hounsfield units), and spirometry-based lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively in patients with lung cancer and compared them between patients undergoing upper lobectomy (n = 34) and patients undergoing lower lobectomy (n = 26).We removed 17% \u00b1 4% of the functional lung volume by upper lobectomy and 27% \u00b1 5% by lower lobectomy (P < .001). Postoperatively, the residual lung expanded by various degrees, accompanied by a proportionate gain in the residual lung function (R = 0.6, P < .001). This anatomic and functional compensation of the residual lung was more remarkable after lower lobectomy than after upper lobectomy (P <.05). Consequently, the percentage loss of the functional lung volume after upper lobectomy (10% \u00b1 10%) did not differ significantly from that after lower lobectomy (9% \u00b1 12%, P = .6). Likewise, the percentage loss of lung function after upper lobectomy (12% \u00b1 16%) did not differ significantly from that after lower lobectomy (14% \u00b1 17%, P = .6).Although the lower lobectomy implies greater resection than the upper lobectomy, lung function after lower lobectomy was not inferior to that after upper lobectomy because the compensatory response appeared more robust after lower lobectomy.",

Preconditioning chemotherapeutic drugs, total body irradiation (TBI), or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can cause several chest complications after HSCT. Because immunosuppression is marked after HSCT, it takes at least 1 year for the immune system to recover completely. Therefore, several infectious and noninfectious complications may occur within the year after HSCT. HSCT-specific complications occur in a characteristic temporal sequence associated with the period following HSCT. During the neutropenic phase, bacterial pneumonia, fungal infection, pulmonary edema, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage may occur. During the early phase, pneumocystis pneumonia, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, engraftment syndrome, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome are the common complications. During the late phase, constrictive bronchiolitis and organizing pneumonia may occur probably associated with chronic GVHD. Although high-resolution CT findings lack specificity, the frequency and likelihood of occurrence of certain complications in certain phases and sometimes characteristic features (such as a CT halo sign for fungal infection) facilitate early detection of a life-threatening complication.",

The presence, extent, and anatomical distribution of the CT findings were assessed by two radiologists. The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of each criterion determined by the combination of CT findings that were characteristic in previous studies were calculated.The average sensitivity of each criterion was 0.50 in the total cases. There were many false positives, and the PPVs of some criteria were low. Among the significantly less frequent CT findings, the frequency of bronchovascular bundle thickening was 0% in cytomegaloviral pneumonia (CMV P). The absence of this finding improved the diagnostic accuracy of CMV P.Because the combination of only characteristic HRCT findings in each disease was of relatively limited value in making a diagnosis, infrequent findings should be also added to the CT criteria to improve accuracy.",

The preoperative helical CT scans of 223 patients with lung cancer were retrospectively reviewed. The probability of malignancy of coexisting small nodules was evaluated based on nodule size, location, and clinical stage of the primary lung cancers. Seventy-one coexisting small nodules were found on conventional CT in 58 (26%) of 223 patients, and 14 (6%) patients had malignant nodules. Eighteen (25%) of such nodules were malignant. The probability of malignancy was not significantly different between two groups of nodules larger and smaller than 0.5 cm ( p=0.1). The probability of malignancy of such nodules within primary tumor lobe was significantly higher than that in the other lobes ( p<0.01). Metastatic nodules were significantly fewer in clinical stage-IA patients than in the patients with the other stage ( p<0.01); however, four (57%) of seven synchronous lung cancers were located in the non-primary tumor lobes in the clinical stage-I patients. Malignant coexisting small nodules are not infrequent, and such nodules in the non-primary tumor lobes should be carefully diagnosed.",

An evaluation was carried out to determine whether there was a significant difference in the two parameters between the presence and absence of each HRCT finding.The two parameters of crackles were significantly shorter in the interstitial pneumonia group than the non-interstitial pneumonia group. Ground-glass opacity, honeycombing, lung volume reduction, traction bronchiectasis, centrilobular nodules, emphysematous change, and attenuation and volume change between inspiratory and expiratory CT were correlated with one or two parameters in all patients, whereas the other three findings were not. Among the interstitial pneumonia group, traction bronchiectasis, emphysematous change, and attenuation and volume change between inspiratory and expiratory CT were significantly correlated with one or two parameters.Abnormal respiratory sounds were correlated with some HRCT findings.",

However, the diagnosis of the IIPs is a difficult problem for radiologists because it has a variety of patterns. We tried to use a computerized analysis method for the image features of HRCT for three high-incidence groups of IIPs; idiopathic interstitial pneumonia/usual interstitial pneumonia (IPF/UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (COP/BOOP). In CT images, each has characteristic manifestations: honeycomb opacity, ground-glass opacity, and consolidation. We analyzed them by using power spectrum analysis, and our system achieved a correct classification rate of 81.6%.",

        "abstract": "Preventing air leaks after major lung resection for cancer is mandatory for successful fast-track surgical intervention. We reported our preliminary results with performance of pneumostasis by combining polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue; however, the advantages of this combination over the conventional method have not been clarified.We controlled air leaks detected during an intraoperative water-seal test by using sutures and fibrin glue before April 2006 and by combining polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue without sutures thereafter. We removed the chest tube the day after the air leaks stopped. For bias reduction in comparison with the 2 historical cohorts, we used the nearest available matching method with the estimated propensity score.The durations of chest tube drainage and postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter in the mesh-and-glue group (n = 61) than in the glue-alone group (n = 61). The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was lower in the mesh-and-glue group than in the glue-alone group (0% vs 7%, P = .042). According to a stratification analysis, the benefit of combining mesh and glue to reduce the duration of chest tube drainage was limited in patients undergoing upper lobe resection and in patients with severe emphysema undergoing other types of resection.Combining bioabsorbable mesh and glue for pneumostasis can reduce the duration of chest tube drainage, postoperative hospital stay, and pulmonary complications after major lung resection for cancer. Patients undergoing upper lobe resection and those with severe emphysema might be the best candidates for this technique.",

        "abstract": "Bone marrow contains many kinds of primitive cells that could differentiate to endothelial cells and secrete several growth factors. In the current study, we attempted to induce therapeutic angiogenesis by implanting autologous bone marrow cells (BMCs) and using a rat ischemic hind limb model.BMCs were prepared by removing red blood cells. A rat ischemic hind limb model was made by the ligation of the left femoral artery and its branches. BMCs were injected into 7 points of the ischemic muscles. To assess angiogenesis, a microangiogram, laser Doppler, and histologic evaluation were performed after the surgical procedure.A microangiogram and histologic evaluation showed that angiogenesis was significantly induced in the ischemic hind limb by the implantation of BMCs. Laser Doppler imaging analysis showed that blood flow was significantly increased after implantation of BMCs. Some implanted BMCs were stained positively with CD31 and vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin), which might have been incorporated into the vasculature. The condition of ischemia caused an elevation in the level of basic fibroblast growth factor in the ischemic muscle and also in interleukin-1beta derived from the implanted BMCs, which might contribute to angiogenesis.These findings indicate that autologous bone marrow implantation may be a novel and simple method for inducing therapeutic angiogenesis.",

Activated neutrophils are a possible pathogenesis of RP. Neutrophil activation induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may exacerbate RP. We studied the effects of recombinant human G-CSF on acute lung injury induced by thoracic irradiation using rats. Animals were divided into three groups: sham irradiation with saline control, irradiation alone, and irradiation with G-CSF. Actual irradiation was given as a single fraction of 16 Gy delivered to the right hemithorax. G-CSF at a dose of 12 microg/body was administered subcutaneously once a day from 14 to 18 days after actual irradiation. Lung injury was evaluated 21 days after irradiation by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid findings and the lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in BAL fluid and the W/D ratio were significantly increased in the irradiation alone and the irradiation with G-CSF groups compared with those of the sham irradiation + saline control group. However, there was no significant difference observed between the irradiation alone and irradiation with G-CSF groups. In conclusion, this study suggests that postradiation administration of G-CSF does not exacerbate acute lung injury induced by thoracic irradiation in rats.",

To verify the clinical usefulness of this technique, we examined if it can contribute to preserving gas exchange capacity and promoting postoperative rehabilitation.We prospectively collected perioperative data, including arterial oxygen saturation on postoperative day (POD) 1 and the length of postoperative rehabilitation in 100 patients undergoing elective, video-assisted major lung resection for cancer. Before April, 2006, intraoperative air leaks were sealed with the conventional method (control group), and thereafter, with bioabsorbable mesh and glue, without suturing, (treated group). To reduce the bias in comparison of the nonrandomized control group, we paired the treated group with the control group using the nearest available matching method on the estimated propensity score.Thirty-five patients in the control group were matched to 35 patients in the treated group based on the estimated propensity score. The length of both chest tube drainage and postoperative rehabilitation were significantly shorter in the treated group than in the control group (median, 1 versus 1 d, P = 0.03; 2 versus 3 d, P = 0.01, respectively). The arterial oxygen saturation on POD 1 was significantly higher in the treated group than in the control group (median, 94.0 versus 92.5 %, P = 0.03).Mesh-based pneumostasis during video-assisted major lung resection enabled early chest tube removal, preserved postoperative oxygenation capacity, and promoted postoperative rehabilitation, which may facilitate fast-track surgery for patients undergoing video-assisted major lung resection for cancer.",

        "abstract": "Objective\u00a0\u00a0The aim of this study is to clarify the difference of F-18 FDG uptake kinetics between FDG-avid non-small-cell lung cancer\n (NSCLC) and benign lesions associated with various etiologies on dual-time point PET/CT scan, and to determine the optimal\n parameter for differentiation.\n \n \n \n Materials and methods\u00a0\u00a0The materials were 76 FDG-avid solitary NSCLC in 76 patients and 57 FDG-avid solitary benign lesions associated with various\n etiologies in 61 patients. FDG PET/CT scan was performed at 60 and 120\u00a0min after intravenous injection of 4.4\u00a0MBq/kg F-18\n FDG. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on early and delayed scans and the percent change of SUVmax (%\u0394SUVmax)\n between the two time points were measured. The optimal differential parameter was determined by receiver-operating characteristic\n curve analysis and evaluation of diagnostic accuracy.\n \n \n \n Results\u00a0\u00a0The mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD of early SUV max, delayed SUVmax and %\u0394SUVmax were 8.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2, and 10.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.5, and 21.9%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.9 in FDG-avid NSCLC,\n and 3.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2, 4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7, and 11.3%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.0 in FDG-avid benign lesions, respectively. Delayed SUVmax in NSCLC was significantly\n higher than early SUVmax (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001); while not different in benign lesions. Percent change of SUVmax in NSCLC was also significantly higher than that\n in benign lesions (P\u00a0\u00a05.5 and yielded sensitivity of 77.6%, specificity\n of 80.7% and accuracy of 78.9%, which provided better differentiation than the use of %\u0394SUVmax or the traditional parameter\n of early SUVmax\u00a0>\u00a02.5. However, 11 (19.2%) benign lesions were indistinguishable from NSCLC.\n \n \n \n Conclusion\u00a0\u00a0Although delayed PET/CT scan enhances the difference of FDG uptake between FDG-avid NSCLC and benign lesions, and the use\n of delayed SUVmax\u00a0>\u00a05.5 appears to improve the differentiation of these hypermetabolic lesions compared with an early scan,\n careful interpretation and management for correct differentiation are still required.",

        "abstract": "Lung perfusion impairment in patients with pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) was evaluated by automated deep inspiratory breath-hold (DIBrH) perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-CT fusion images.Participants were 14 patients with a single (N=6) or multiple nodular AVFs (N=8) diagnosed by contrast-enhanced CT scan and/or pulmonary angiography. After the injection of 185MBq Tc-99m-macroaggregated albumin, a whole-body scan was obtained to quantify an intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt. Subsequently, DIBrH SPECT was obtained using the continuous rotating acquisition mode of a dual-headed SPECT system, which was automatically coregistered with DIBrH CT. The anatomic relationship between AVF and perfusion defects was assessed on the fusion images.The whole-body scan depicted systemic organs indicating the presence of an intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt in all the patients. DIBrH SPECT showed 34 perfusion defects in these patients, which were located at the AVF and in the surrounding lungs of the AVF on the fusion images, regardless of the absence of morphologic abnormality on CT in all the patients. These defects were considered to be caused by the 'steal phenomenon' associated with the high and fast pulmonary arterial flow to each AVF, which were more extensive and severe in the multiple AVFs compared with a single AVF (P=0.0012), occasionally extending to the entire lobe with AVF or even to the adjacent lobe. In five patients, the fusion images detected a total of six tiny AVFs with unexpectedly extensive 'steal phenomenon'-induced defects, which had been missed by other radiological imaging techniques. The summed value of the shunt index estimated by the whole-body scan and the lung perfusion defect extent estimated by DIBrH SPECT was significantly correlated with PaO2 in all the patients (P < 0.0001), with a better correlation compared with the shunt index alone.In addition to the right-to-left shunt, 'steal phenomenon'-induced perfusion defects are common in the surrounding lung of pulmonary nodular AVF and cause hypoxemia. DIBrH SPECT-CT fusion images contribute to the objective evaluation of 'steal phenomenon'-induced lung perfusion impairment in AVF and the detection of tiny, subtle AVFs that may be missed by other radiological imaging techniques.",

The CT findings of 11 leukemic patients with leukemic pulmonary infiltration were compared with those of 22 leukemic patients with other diseases as a control group. Evaluated pulmonary parenchymal CT findings included thickening of bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septa, prominence of peripheral pulmonary arteries, ground-glass opacities, air-space consolidation, and nodules. The CT-pathologic correlations for leukemic infiltration were evaluated in 7 patients. Frequent parenchymal CT findings were thickening of bronchovascular bundles (81.8%), prominence of peripheral pulmonary arteries (81.8%), and non-lobular and non-segmental ground-glass opacities (90.9%). The first two findings were significantly more frequently observed in leukemic infiltration than in the control group, had good interobserver agreement, and corresponded pathologically to leukemic cell infiltration around the pulmonary arteries, bronchi, or bronchioles. Non-lobular and non-segmental ground-glass opacity corresponded to leukemic cell infiltration within alveolar spaces and septa adjacent to the pulmonary arteries or bronchi and also corresponded to hemorrhage, edema, or diffuse alveolar damage. Thickening of bronchovascular bundles and prominence of peripheral pulmonary arteries are CT findings suggestive for leukemic infiltration and correspond to peribronchovascular tumor extension.",

        "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease among elderly people that, when surgical treatment is inapplicable, results in progressive expansion and rupture of the aorta with high mortality. Although nonsurgical treatment for AAA is much awaited, few options are available because its molecular pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we identify JNK as a proximal signaling molecule in the pathogenesis of AAA. Human AAA tissue showed a high level of phosphorylated JNK. We show that JNK programs a gene expression pattern in different cell types that cooperatively enhances the degradation of the extracellular matrix while suppressing biosynthetic enzymes of the extracellular matrix. Selective inhibition of JNK in vivo not only prevented the development of AAA but also caused regression of established AAA in two mouse models. Thus, JNK promotes abnormal extracellular matrix metabolism in the tissue of AAA and may represent a therapeutic target.",

We compared the functional volume of the ipsilateral lung to be resected, the ipsilateral lung to be preserved and the contralateral lung before, and 6 months after the operation, between the groups. Functional lung volume was defined as the lung volume representing normal attenuation (-600 to -910 Hounsfield units (HUs)) on computed tomography. We also compared the volumetric parameters to the spirometric parameters in 42 other patients, who underwent major lung resection for stage I lung cancer.We removed 11.6% of the functional lung volume by segmentectomy and 24.5% by lobectomy (P<0.001). However, the loss of the functional lung volume after segmentectomy was only 8.3% and that after lobectomy was 9.2%: this difference was not significant (P=0.7). Both the ipsilateral residual lung and the contralateral lung increased in functional volume more extensively after lobectomy than after segmentectomy. Increased postoperative functional lung volume was significantly correlated with improvement in postoperative pulmonary function (R=0.6, P<0.001).Although lung segmentectomy can reduce the extent of lung resection, it may not contribute to preserving postoperative functional lung volume because lobectomy promotes postoperative expansion of the bilateral residual lung, which compensates postoperative pulmonary functional loss to a greater extent than segmentectomy.",

        "abstract": "Emphysema is a well-known risk factor for developing air leak or persistent air leak after pulmonary resection. Although quantitative computed tomography (CT) and spirometry are used to diagnose emphysema, it remains controversial whether these tests are predictive of the duration of postoperative air leak.Sixty-two consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo major lung resection for cancer were enrolled in this prospective study to define the best predictor of postoperative air leak duration. Preoperative factors analyzed included spirometric variables and area of emphysema (proportion of the low-attenuation area) that was quantified in a three-dimensional CT lung model. Chest tubes were removed the day after disappearance of the air leak, regardless of pleural drainage. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazards analyses were used to determine the influence of preoperative factors on chest tube time (air leak duration).By univariate analysis, site of resection (upper, lower), forced expiratory volume in 1 second, predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and area of emphysema (< 1%, 1% to 10%, > 10%) were significant predictors of air leak duration. By multivariate analysis, site of resection and area of emphysema were the best independent determinants of air leak duration. The results were similar for patients with a smoking history (n = 40), but neither forced expiratory volume in 1 second nor predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second were predictive of air leak duration.Quantitative CT is superior to spirometry in predicting air leak duration after major lung resection for cancer. Quantitative CT may aid in the identification of patients, particularly among those with a smoking history, requiring additional preventive procedures against air leak.",

Volumetric analysis in combination with densitometric analysis of the affected lung lobe or segment with quantitative computed tomography (CT) helps to identify residual pulmonary function, although the utility of this modality needs investigation.The subjects of this prospective study were 30 patients with resectable lung cancer. A three-dimensional CT lung model was created with voxels representing normal lung attenuation (-600 to -910 Hounsfield units). Residual pulmonary function was predicted by drawing a boundary line between the lung to be preserved and that to be resected, directly on the lung model. The predicted values were correlated with the postoperative measured values.The predicted and measured values corresponded well (r=0.89, p<0.001). Although the predicted values corresponded with values predicted by simple calculation using a segment-counting method (r=0.98), there were two outliers whose pulmonary functional reserves were predicted more accurately by CT than by segment counting. The measured pulmonary functional reserves were significantly higher than the predicted values in patients with extensive emphysematous areas (<-910 Hounsfield units), but not in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Quantitative CT yielded accurate prediction of functional reserve after lung cancer surgery and helped to identify patients whose functional reserves are likely to be underestimated. Hence, this modality should be utilized for patients with marginal pulmonary function.",

In addition to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), therapy for malignant disease, and immune suppression for solid organ transplants, patients are now rendered immunosuppressed by advances in treatment for a wide variety of autoimmune diseases. The number of possible infecting organisms can be bewildering. Recognition of the type of immune defect and the duration and depth of immunosuppression (particularly in hematopoietic and solid organ transplants) can help generate a differential diagnosis. Radiologic imaging plays an important role in the detection and diagnosis of chest complications occurring in immunocompromised patients; however, chest radiography alone seldom provides adequate sensitivity and specificity. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) can provide better sensitivity and specificity, but even CT findings may be nonspecific findings unless considered in conjunction with the clinical context. Combination of CT pattern, clinical setting, and immunologic status provides the best chance for an accurate diagnosis. In this article, CT findings have been divided into 4 patterns: focal consolidation, nodules/masses, small/micronodules, and diffuse ground-glass attenuation/consolidation. Differential diagnoses are suggested for each pattern, adjusted for both AIDS and non-AIDS immunosuppressed patients.",

        "abstract": "Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is an acute lung dysfunction of non-infectious aetiology and a severe complication following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Recently, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) updated the concept of IPS and extended the concept to a wider range; it defined IPS as \u201can idiopathic syndrome of pneumopathy after HSCT, with evidence of widespread alveolar injury and in which infectious aetiologies and cardiac dysfunction, acute renal failure, or iatrogenic fluid overload have been excluded.\u201d The ATS also categorised the presumed site of primary tissue injury into three patterns (pulmonary parenchyma, vascular endothelium, and airway epithelium), each of which has several entities. Since the therapeutic strategies for IPS are clearly different from those of infectious diseases, and therapeutic delay causes a poor prognosis, radiologists should be aware of some characteristic HRCT findings of IPS, which includes a wide spectrum of entities. In this article, the characteristic HRCT findings of these entities, including acute interstitial pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, non-cardiogenic capillary leak syndrome, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, transfusion-related acute lung injury, organising pneumonia, and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, are shown.",

        "abstract": "The function of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors, especially the 5-HT4 receptor, in the urinary bladder were examined in preparations isolated from the guinea pig by in vitro receptor autoradiography and determinations of mechanical activity and acetylcholine (ACh) release. Specific [125I]SB207710 binding sites were detected evenly throughout the urinary bladder. 5-HT (3 x 10(-8)-10(-4) M) caused contractions of strips of the urinary bladder, in a concentration dependent manner. Ketanserin antagonized the 5-HT-induced contractions, while granisetron and SB204070 antagonized the contractions induced by high concentrations of 5-HT. Atropine inhibited the contractions induced by high concentrations of 5-HT. Ketanserin prevented the 5-HT-induced contractions in the presence of atropine, but granisetron and SB204070 did not affect the contractions under such a condition. 5-HT enhanced the electrically-stimulated (5 Hz, 0.5 ms) outflow of [3H]acetylcholine from strips preloaded with [3H]choline, and the enhancement was antagonized by granisetron and SB204070. Thus, the contractile response to 5-HT was mediated by activations of 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. The 5-HT2 receptor may be a property of high affinity to 5-HT and located on the smooth muscle cells. The 5-HT4 as well as 5-HT3 receptor may be a property of low affinity to 5-HT and located on the cholinergic neurons.",

Treatments were begun with the 2-week RFE session in one group and the 2-week CR session in the second group.After the first 2-week RFE session, both groups showed improvements in the Brunnstrom stages of the upper limb and the hand, in contrast to the small improvements observed during the first CR session. The Simple Test for Evaluating Hand Function (STEF) score, which evaluates the ability of manipulating objects, in both groups improved during both sessions. After the second 2-week RFE and CR sessions, both groups showed little further improvement except in the STEF score.The novel RFEs promoted the functional recovery of the hemiplegic upper limb and hand to a greater extent than the CR sessions.",

Through a comparative before-and-after study, we studied the hemodynamic and clinical effects of single exposure to LTSB in cerebral palsy (CP) patients who usually suffer from chilled extremities and low cardiac output. The study population comprised 16 patients ranging between 19 and 53 years with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. Noninvasive methods were used to estimate the systemic and peripheral circulatory changes before and after LTSB. Using blood flow velocity analysis, the pulsatile and resistive indexes of the peripheral arteries of the patients' lower limbs were calculated. Following LTSB, the patients' deep body temperature increased significantly by 1 degrees C. Their heart rates increased and blood pressure decreased slightly. The total peripheral resistance decreased by 11%, and the cardiac output increased by 14%. There was significant improvement in the parameters that are indicative of the peripheral circulatory status, including the skin blood flow, blood flow velocity, pulsatile index, and resistive index. Numbness and chronic myalgia of the extremities decreased. There were no adverse side effects. Thus, it can be concluded that LTSB improves the peripheral circulation in CP patients.",

They were selected from among 165 patients with stroke who were admitted to our rehabilitation centre from September 1, 1995 to March 31, 1997.Two 2-week facilitation technique sessions (more than 100 repetitions a day for each of 5 kinds of movement) were applied at 2-week intervals in patients with hemiplegia, who were being treated with continuous conventional rehabilitation exercise without the facilitation technique for hemiplegia. Motor function of the affected lower limb (Brunnstrom Recovery Stage of hemiplegia, the foot-tap test and the strength of knee extension/flexion) and walking velocity were evaluated at 2-week intervals.Significant improvements in Brunnstrom Stage, foot-tapping and the strength of knee extension/flexion of the affected lower limb were seen after the first conventional rehabilitation exercise session and after the first and second facilitation technique and conventional rehabilitation exercise sessions. The improvements after facilitation technique and conventional rehabilitation exercise sessions were significantly greater than those after the preceding conventional rehabilitation exercise sessions.Intensive repetition of movement elicited by the facilitation technique (chiefly proprioceptive neuromuscural facilitation pattern, stretch reflex and skin-muscle reflex) improved voluntary movement of a hemiplegic lower limb in patients with brain damage.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effects of interference tasks in the early stages of motor learning, we used a computerized motor skill analyzer (CMSA) for the lower limb that evaluates the accuracy and speed of movements in tracking tasks. Forty-five healthy subjects were randomly divided into three groups: a control group without an interference task, a mirror image interference group, and a point symmetry interference group. The practice and measurement of motor-learning trials were carried out as follows: (1) 10 practice trials followed by 10 measurement trials in the morning of the first day. (2) 10 measurement trials 6-7 awake hours after the first measurement. (3) 10 measurement trials on the morning of day 2. In the learning interference groups, 10 trials of the mirror image or point symmetry task were performed immediately after the first measurement. Although motor skills of the control group improved, those of the learning interference groups did not. This suggests that a second task performed immediately after the first task interferes with the consolidation of motor skill learning demanding complex visuomotor transformation.",

The CMSA for the arm was used to calculate the accuracy in tracking with the hand. The inter-class correlation coefficients for lap time, geometric trajectory error, trajectory error integrated over time and the marker trajectory error integrated over time were 0.45 (NS)-0.91 (P<0.01) in healthy participants and 0.62 (P<0.05)-0.90 (P<0.01) in patients with stroke. The trajectory error integrated over time and the geometric errors of the affected arm in stroke patients were negatively correlated with the Brunnstrom stage and the simple test for evaluating hand function. The marker trajectory error integrated over time in stroke patients was negatively correlated with the simple test for evaluating hand function. These results suggest that the CMSA for the arm is useful for quantitatively evaluating delicate visuo-motor skills of the arm.",

Twenty-four patients with dysesthesia of the face, oral cavity, or tongue were divided into two groups: with and without subjective dysgeusia. Taste thresholds were objectively evaluated using the filter-paper taste test and electrogustometry. There was no significant difference in taste thresholds between the two groups. Carbamazepine had an effect on subjective dysgeusia in four of the eight treated patients. Dysgeusia with dysesthesia in stroke patients might be caused by disorders of the somatosensory pathway rather than disorders of the gustatory pathway.",

The maximal peak torque of the nonparetic lower limb, including the isokinetic (60 degrees /s, 120 degrees /s, and 180 degrees /s), isotonic, and isometric muscle strength of knee extension/flexion, measured every 2 weeks, was compared with the baseline values. Significant increases in peak torque were seen at 2 weeks in 9 of the 10 conditions and at 6 weeks in 8 of the 10 conditions tested for the AAS group but in only 1 and 5 conditions for the control group, respectively. While no contraindications for AAS were encountered, the combination of AAS and muscle strength training tended to have a positive effect on muscle strength after stroke.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate salivary secretion in unilateral cerebral stroke patients, including the effects of masticatory forces. We compared the volumes of unstimulated and acid-stimulated saliva between 30 patients with unilateral cerebral stroke and 30 age-matched healthy subjects. The volume of whole-mouth salivary secretion was measured by the modified cotton swab method. Occlusal forces were measured with an occlusal force meter in patients/subjects, in groups with normal teeth and dentures, respectively. The volume of unstimulated saliva in stroke patients was significantly lower than that in controls. For subjects with normal teeth, the volume of acid-stimulated saliva and the occlusal force on the hemiplegic side in stroke patients were significantly lower than those in control subjects. For those with dentures, while the volume of unstimulated saliva in stroke patients was significantly lower than that in controls, there were no significant differences in occlusal forces between the two groups. These results suggest that salivary secretion might be reduced in cerebral stroke patients, which might be caused partly by an inability to generate sufficient masticatory force, and which, in turn, might lead to a reduced masticatory-parotid reflex and consequent disuse atrophy of the salivary glands.",

Then, two facilitation exercise sessions (100 times/day, five days/week for two weeks) were administered in addition to the basic rehabilitative treatment for four weeks to the eight patients with ophthalmoplegia. Ophthalmoplegia was evaluated at study entry and at the end of each two-week session. The goal of the facilitation exercises is to facilitate voluntary eye movement using conjugated eye movements in the direction opposite to passive movements of the head.To assess ophthalmoplegia we measured the distance between the internal/external corneal margin and the canthus of the affected eye on images recorded on a video tape recorder.After the initial two-week basic rehabilitative treatment, the distance between the corneal margin and canthus decreased slightly. Subsequently, after each of the two facilitation exercise sessions, there were significant reductions in the distance between the corneal margin and canthus compared with that at the beginning of the respective facilitation exercise session.Facilitation exercises significantly improved the horizontal movement of eyes with ophthalmoplegia due to brainstem injury.",

Specific [125I]endothelin-1 binding sites with both the endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptor subtypes were distributed in the muscle layer. Endothelin-1 elicited a tonic contraction which was inhibited by cyclo(D-Asp-Pro-D-Val-Leu-D-Trp) (BQ123) but not by N-cis-2,6-dimethylpiperidinocarbonyl-L-gamma-methylleucyl-D-1-methoxycarbonyltryptophanyl-D-norleucine (BQ788) and which was inhibited more strongly by a combination of BQ123 and BQ788. Sarafotoxin S6c elicited a contraction which was abolished by BQ788. The concentration of endothelin-1 in the muscle layer was 707.0+/-67.5 pg/g wet weight. Thus, endothelin-1 may regulate muscle tone via both subtypes of endothelin receptors in an autocrine manner in the guinea-pig urinary bladder.",

        "abstract": "Central fatigue is the inability of central commands to recruit maximum evocable muscle force during voluntary contraction. Here, we investigate how fatigue affects the inhibitory circuits of the motor cortex.MEPs, short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were evaluated using a paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm before, during and after a series of 5 isometric contractions of the FDI muscle to 50% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Each contraction lasted 2 min and was separated from the next by a pause of 2 min 40 s. Twelve male healthy subjects (range from 22 to 51 years) participated in experiment 1, in which the intensity of test stimulus was constant throughout the experiment. Eight of the same subjects (range from 26 to 51 years) participated in experiment 2, in which the intensity of test stimulus was adjusted so that the amplitude of the test MEP was kept constant throughout the measurement.As expected, test MEPs gradually decreased with progressive fatigue and recovered to control values with 5-10 min of rest. Because of the change in MEP amplitude, changes in percent SICI (reduced inhibition) and percent ICF (increased facilitation) in experiment 1 are difficult to interpret. When the test MEP was maintained at a constant size in experiment 2 there was no change in percent ICF, but the reduction in SICI was still present although it recovered to control values within the first 5-10 min of rest.SICI in FDI decreases transiently after a series of fatiguing isometric contractions. This decrease may compensate to some extent for reduced cortical excitability after muscle fatigue.",

F-wave parameters have been used to demonstrate changes in motor neuron excitability in spasticity and pharmacological antispastic therapy. The present study aimed to confirm the efficacy of thermotherapy for spasticity by evaluating alterations in F-wave parameters in ten male post-stroke patients with spastic hemiparesis (mean age: 49.0+/-15.0 years) and ten healthy male controls (mean age: 48.7+/-4.4 years). The subjects were immersed in water at 41 degrees C for 10 min. Recordings were made over the abductor hallucis muscle, and antidromic stimulation was performed on the tibial nerve at the ankle. Twenty F-waves were recorded before, immediately after, and 30 min following thermotherapy for each subject. F-wave amplitude and F-wave/M-response ratio were determined. Changes in body temperature and surface-skin temperature were monitored simultaneously. The mean and maximum values of both F-wave parameters were higher on the affected side before thermotherapy. In the post-stroke patients, the mean and maximum values of both parameters were significantly reduced after thermotherapy (P<0.01). Hence, the antispastic effects of thermotherapy were indicated by decreased F-wave parameters. Body temperature was significantly increased both immediately after and 30 min after thermotherapy in all subjects. This appeared to play an important role in decreased spasticity. Surface-skin temperature increased immediately after thermotherapy in both groups and returned to baseline 30 min later. These findings demonstrate that thermotherapy is an effective nonpharmacological antispastic treatment that might facilitate stroke rehabilitation.",

        "abstract": "The interferons (IFNs) have been extensively studied in the context of host defence against viral infection. In the established model of IFN action, virally infected cells secrete type I IFNs (IFN-alpha/beta) which induce an antiviral state in uninfected cells. However, it is not clear how IFNs function on the infected cells. It has been reported that cells infected by some viruses die by apoptosis.In the present study, we found that three types of viruses commonly induce apoptosis in primary cell cultures. Importantly, we observed that virus-induced apoptosis was inhibited by anti-IFN-alpha/beta antibodies, and in cells lacking either the type I IFN receptor 1 (IFNAR1) or its downstream mediator, Stat1 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1). IFN-alpha treatment by itself did not induce apoptosis unless it was combined with transfection by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is normally generated during the course of viral infection.These results indicate a novel antiviral function of the type I IFNs, i.e. the selective induction of apoptosis in virally infected cells. In effect, these IFNs have a bifunctional role in limiting the spread of virus; eliciting an antiviral state in uninfected cells while promoting apoptosis in infected cells. Our results may help explain why IFNs are sometimes useful in the treatment of viral diseases and will provide further insight into the mechanisms of virus-induced pathogenesis.",

Although these IFNs transmit signals through distinct receptor complexes, the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor component, IFNAR1, facilitates efficient assembly of IFN-\u03b3\u2013activated transcription factors. This cross talk is contingent on a constitutive subthreshold IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling and the association between the two nonligand-binding receptor components, IFNAR1 and IFNGR2, in the caveolar membrane domains. This aspect of signaling cross talk by IFNs may apply to other cytokines.",

Following the initial identification of two structurally related members, IRF-1 and IRF-2, seven additional members have now been reported. In addition, virally encoded IRFs, which may interfere with cellular IRFs, have also been identified. Thus far, intensive functional analyses have been done on IRF-1, revealing a remarkable functional diversity of this transcription factor in the regulation of cellular response in host defense. Indeed, IRF-1 selectively modulates different sets of genes, depending on the cell type and/or the nature of cellular stimuli, in order to evoke appropriate responses in each. More recently, much attention has also been focused on other IRF family members. Their functional roles, through interactions with their own or other members of the family of transcription factors, are becoming clearer in the regulation of host defense, such as innate and adaptive immune responses and oncogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Complex cellular responses are often coordinated by a genetic regulatory network in which a given transcription factor controls the expression of a diverse set of target genes. Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF-2 have originally been identified as a transcriptional activator and repressor, respectively, of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) as well as of IFN-inducible genes. However, these factors have since been shown to modulate not only the cellular response to IFNs, but also cell growth, susceptibility to transformation by oncogenes, induction of apoptosis, and development of the T cell immune response. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that deletion and/or inactivation of the IRF-1 gene may be a critical step in the development of some human hematopoietic neoplasms. Subsequently, these factors have been shown to constitute a family of transcription factors, termed the IRF-family. Recent studies indicate that other IRF family members also involve the regulation of the IFN system and cell transformation. The IRF-family may be examples of transcription factors which can selectively modulate several sets of genes depending on the cell type and/or nature of the cellular stimuli, so as to evoke host defense mechanisms against infection and oncogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Two distinct types of interferon, IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma, commonly exhibit antiviral activities by transmitting signals to the interior of the cell via their homologous receptors. Receptor stimulation results in the activation of distinct combinations of Janus family protein tyrosine kinases (Jak PTKs); Jak1/Tyk2 and Jak1/Jak2 for IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma, respectively. Jak PTK activation by these IFNs is commonly followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor Stat1 at Y701, which is essential for dimerization, translocation to the nucleus and DNA-binding activity. To gain full transcriptional activity, Stat1 also requires serine phosphorylation at S727. In this paper we demonstrate that Pyk2, which belongs to another PTK family, is critical for the Jak-mediated MAPK and Stat1 activation by IFN-gamma, but not IFN-alpha. Pyk2 is selectively associated with Jak2 and activated by IFN-gamma. Overexpression of PKM, a dominant interfering form of Pyk2, in NIH 3T3 cells results in a strong inhibition of the IFN-gamma-induced activation of Erk2, serine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat1-dependent gene transcription. Finally, the antiviral action of IFN-gamma, but not IFN-alpha, is severely impaired by PKM overexpression. Thus, the two types of IFN may utilize distinct Jak-mediated Erk2, and possibly other MAPK activation pathways for their antiviral action.",

Here we report an alternative mechanism by which IRF-1 may be inactivated. We purified an IRF-1 association molecule which was revealed to be identical to a nuclear factor nucleophosmin (NPM)/B23/numatrin. Functional analysis showed that NPM inhibited the DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of IRF-1. Moreover, NPM was overexpressed in several clinical leukemia samples and human-derived leukemia cell lines. Finally, overexpression of NPM in NIH3T3 cells resulted in malignant transformation.

        "abstract": "Signalling cross talk provides a molecular basis for modulating a given signalling pathway by another, and it is often critical for regulating cellular responses elicited by cytokines. Previously, we reported on the critical role of the IFN-alpha/beta signalling complex, generated by spontaneously produced IFN-alpha/beta, in efficient IFN-gamma signalling.In the present study, we have demonstrated that the IFN-alpha/beta signalling complex also contributes to efficient IL-6 signalling. In fact, IL-6-induced activation of the Stat1 and Stat3 transcription factors is markedly diminished in the absence of the IFN-alpha/beta signalling complex. The induction of several target genes for these factors is also diminished, both in vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence that the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of IFNAR-1, which remains phosphorylated by a weak IFN-alpha/beta stimulation, provide docking sites for Stat1 and Stat3 to form homo- or heterodimers following IL-6 stimulation. Furthermore, a chemical cross-linking experiment revealed that IFNAR-1 and gp130, a common signal transducer for the IL-6 family of cytokines, exist in close proximity.The constitutive weak IFN-alpha/beta signal provides a foundation for strong cellular responses to IL-6, IFN-gamma, and possibly other cytokines. Our results also suggest the assembly of cytokine receptor subunits, which may represent a 'receptosome'-like structure, allowing the unique signalling cross talks to occur.",

A series of studies has revealed that LOH on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) frequently occurs in differentiated gastric adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, it has been shown that the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) locus on chromosome 5q31.1 is one of the common minimal regions of LOH in these cancers. IRF-1 is a transcriptional activator that shows tumor-suppressor activity in the mouse. In the present study, we examined the sequence of the IRF-1 gene in 9 cases of histologically differentiated gastric adenocarcinomas, all of which exhibited LOH at the IRF-1 locus. We identified a mis-sense mutation in the residual allele in one case. This mutated form of IRF-1 showed markedly reduced transcriptional activity. In addition, overexpression of wild-type IRF-1 induced cell-cycle arrest, whereas such activity was attenuated in the mutant IRF-1. These results suggest that the loss of functional IRF-1 is critical for the development of human gastric cancers.",

        "abstract": "Efficient IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 gene induction in virus-infected cells is an event central to innate immunity, in which the transcription factor IRF-7 plays a critical role together with IRF-3. Unlike IRF-3, IRF-7 is short-lived and its gene expression is dependent on IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signalling; hence, the signal-dependent enhancement of IRF-7 gene induction during viral infection is essential for positive-feedback regulation of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 gene induction. Here, we provide evidence that constitutive, IRF-3/IRF-7-independent production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in uninfected cells is critical for setting the IRF-7 expression levels, determining whether or not the positive-feedback mechanism will operate effectively upon viral infection. In fact, spleen cells are more dependent than fibroblasts on this mechanism; the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 gene induction is impaired more severely by blocking the IRF-7 induction pathway than by introducing an IRF-3 null mutation. Thus, the constitutive IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signal provides a foundation for the IRF-7-mediated enhancement of its own production in response to virus infection.",

Mice lacking the transcription factor IRF-3 are more vulnerable to virus infection. In embryonic fibroblasts, virus-induced IFN-alpha/beta gene expression levels are reduced and the spectrum of the IFN-alpha mRNA subspecies altered. Furthermore, cells additionally defective in IRF-7 expression totally fail to induce these genes in response to infections by any of the virus types tested. In these cells, a normal profile of IFN-alpha/beta mRNA induction can be achieved by coexpressing both IRF-3 and IRF-7.

        "abstract": "Interferons-alpha/beta, which are produced upon viral infection, are key soluble factors for the establishment of an antiviral state, but are also produced at low levels in the absence of infection. Herein, we demonstrate that a weak signal by these constitutively produced IFN-alpha/beta show a preventive role in cellular transformation. Ifnar1-deficient (Ifnar1(-/-)) MEF, which are devoid of IFN-alpha/beta signal, undergo a spontaneous transformation during long-term cell culture. Similar to Irf1(-/-) MEF, primary Ifnar1(-/-) MEF become tumorigenic in nude mice by the expression of activated c-Ha-Ras oncoprotein. However, Ifnar1(-/-) MEF do not show any abnormal growth properties. A similar observation is made in Ifnb(-/-) MEF that fail to produce constitutive IFN-alpha/beta, whereas such a transforming property is not found in MEF that lack any of the IFN receptor downstream molecules including Stat1, IRF9 and IRF1. Furthermore, Ifnar1(-/-) mice develop chemically-induced skin papilloma more severely than wild-type mice. In addition, the expression levels of IFNAR1 mRNA are significantly decreased in human gastric cancer tissues. These results suggest a cell-intrinsic role of the weak signal by constitutively produced IFN-alpha/beta to prevent cells from transformation, which may be mediated by a hitherto-unknown pathway(s) downstream of the IFN-alpha/beta receptor.",

        "abstract": "Lymphocytes are particularly susceptible to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, a response which may serve as a form of 'altruistic suicide' to counter their intrinsic high potential for mutation and clonal expansion. The tumour suppressor p53 has been shown to regulate this type of apoptosis in thymocytes, but an as yet unknown, p53-independent pathway(s) appears to mediate the same event in mitogen-activated mature T lymphocytes. Here we show DNA damage-induced apoptosis in these T lymphocytes is dependent on the antioncogenic transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1. Thus two different anti-onco-genic transcription factors, p53 and IRF-1, are required for distinct apoptotic pathways in T lymphocytes. We also show that mitogen induction of the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) gene, a mammalian homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3, is IRF-1-dependent. Ectopic overexpression of IRF-1 results in the activation of the endogenous gene for ICE and enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "2',5'-Oligoadenylate synthetase (2'5'OAS), an enzyme induced by interferon (IFN), is physiologically produced in IFN-untreated normal healthy mice. The enzyme is localized mainly in the epithelium of the digestive tract, reproductive organs, and the choroid plexus in the brain. 2'5'OAS is also detected in oocytes in the ovary and in neurons and glial cells of both the telencephalon and cerebellum. Here, we examined the role of p48 (ISGF3gamma), a component of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), in the physiologic production of 2'5'OAS using p48-deficient mice generated by gene targeting. In the p48-deficient mice, the physiologic production of 2'5'OAS localized in the following cells was severely impaired: hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, splenocytes, epithelium of the large intestine, oviduct, and uterus, and neurons and glial cells in both the telencephalon and cerebellum. The results show that 2'5'OAS in these cells is induced physiologically through a pathway including p48. However, the production of 2'5'OAS in oocytes was not affected in the p48-deficient mice, indicating that oocyte 2'5'OAS is produced through a p48-independent pathway. A possible function of the GAS sequence found in the promoter region of the 2'5'OAS gene to which Stat6 may bind also is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Cyclin C, a putative G1 cyclin, was originally isolated through its ability to complement a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking the G1 cyclin gene CLN1-3. Unlike cyclins D1 and E, the other two G1 cyclins obtained by the same approach and subsequently shown to play important roles during the G1/S transition, there is thus far no evidence to support the hypothesis that cyclin C is indeed critical for the promotion of cell cycle pro- gression. In BAF-B03 cells, an interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent murine pro-B-cell line, cyclin C gene mRNA was induced at the G1/S phase upon IL-3 stimulation and reached a maximal level in the S phase. Enforced expression of exogenous cyclin C in this cell line failed to alter its growth properties. In the present study, we examined whether cyclin C is capable of cooperating with the cytokine-responsive immediate-early gene pro- ducts c-Myc and c-Fos in the promotion of cell proliferation. We found that cyclin C is able to cooperate func- tionally with c-Myc, but not c-Fos, to induce both BAF-B03 cell proliferation in a cytokine-independent fashion and the formation of cell clusters. Furthermore, cyclin C was primarily responsible for the induction of cdc2 gene expression. Our data define a novel role for cyclin C in the regulation of both the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and this effect appears to be independent of the activity of CDK8 in the control of transcription.",

Here we report that embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) from mice with a null mutation in the IRF-1 gene (IRF-1-/- mice) can be transformed by expression of an activated c-Ha-ras oncogene. This property is not observed in EFs from wild-type or IRF-2-/- mice but is still observed in EFs from mice deficient in both genes. The transformed phenotype of ras-expressing IRF-1-/- EFs could be suppressed by the expression of the IRF-1 cDNA. Thus, IRF-1 functions as a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, expression of the c-Ha-ras oncogene causes wild-type but not IRF-1-/- EFs to undergo apoptosis when combined with a block to cell proliferation or treated by anticancer drugs or ionizing radiation. Hence, IRF-1 may be a critical determinant of oncogene-induced cell transformation or apoptosis.",

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 is essential for the regulation of the interferon system, inhibits cell growth, and manifests tumour-suppressor activities. Here we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) lacking IRF-1 are deficient in their ability to undergo DNA-damage-induced cell-cycle arrest. A similar phenotype has been observed in EFs lacking the tumour suppressor p53 (refs 8, 9), although the expression of IRF-1 and p53 are independent of one another. Furthermore, we show that transcriptional induction of the gene encoding p21 (WAF1, CIP1), a cell-cycle inhibitor, by gamma-irradiation is dependent on both p53 and IRF-1, and that the p21 promoter is activated, either directly or indirectly, by both in a transient cotransfection assay. These two tumour-suppressor transcription factors therefore converge functionally to regulate the cell cycle through the activation of a common target gene.",

Potential\n habitat maps under the current and future climates were generated at about 1-km spatial resolution.\n \n \n \n \n \n Results\n \u00a0\u00a0The model was highly accurate. Although snow cover has been thought to be the most important factor controlling S. borealis distribution, we revealed that the species requires high precipitation during the growing season even in humid Japanese environments.\n Areas with high summer (May\u2013September) precipitation (PRS) were classified as potential habitat irrespective of other climatic\n conditions. In areas with moderate PRS, potential habitat was limited to cooler and less snow-covered areas and areas with\n low PRS were classified as non-habitat. The high fitness of the predicted to the observed distributions suggested that S. borealis could have survived throughout the Japanese Archipelago during the glacial period.\n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion\n \u00a0\u00a0In future climates, 29.0\u201339.1% of the current potential habitat was predicted to change to non-habitat due to increasing dryness\n in the growing season. Areas with high precipitation remained a potential habitat for S. borealis.",

The mean decrease in the Gini criterion revealed that WI was the most influential factor followed by\n TMC. The RF revealed a considerable increase in potential habitats (PHs) under the climate change scenarios for 2081\u20132100\n (RCM20, 180,141\u00a0km2; MIROC, 175,635\u00a0km2) relative to the current climate (150,542\u00a0km2). The land use variables were used for masking PH. The PH masked by land use (PHLU) was approximately half of the PH under\n the current conditions (74,567\u00a0km2). Under the climate change scenarios and 1\u00a0km migration options, the PHLU were not increased relative to its value under\n the current conditions. The distribution of Q. acuta was restricted by the northward shift in northern Honshu, but expanded as a result of the upward shift into the mountain\n areas of Western Japan. Habitat fragmentation reduced the ability of migration to respond to climate change in the lowland\n areas of Japan.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify climatic factors determining the distribution of a keystone understory taxon,\n section Crassinodi of the genus Sasa, and assess the impacts of climate change on the taxon. Relationships between the distribution of sect. Crassinodi and five climatic variables were explored using classification tree analysis. Potential habitats under current climate and\n future climate in 2081\u20132100 were predicted. Potential habitats were further divided into suitable and marginal habitats. The\n predictive accuracy of the model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis and by comparing model predictions\n with an independent dataset. The model was reasonably accurate. It showed that the warmth index (WI) and snow cover were the\n most important climatic variables for Crassinodi distribution. Potential habitats were limited to cooler regions with WI <102.7\u00b0C\u00a0month. Suitable habitats were limited to\n even cooler regions with WI <84.8\u00b0C\u00a0month. The model also showed that areas with deeper snow than previously reported would\n provide suitable habitats for Crassinodi under some climatic conditions. In 2081\u20132100, 37.4% of current potential habitats are predicted to become non-habitats because\n of increases in WI. Most currently suitable habitats are predicted to vanish from western Japan by 2081\u20132100. Meanwhile, Hokkaido\n and high-elevation areas of eastern Honshu will sustain suitable habitats. Sect. Crassinodi, which is adapted to less snowy climates, is predicted to be more affected by climate change than sect. Sasa and Macrochlamys, which are adapted to snowy climates.",

        "abstract": "The fact that plant invasions are an ongoing process makes generalizations of invasive spread extraordinarily challenging. This is particularly true given the idiosyncratic nature of invasions, in which both historical and local conditions affect establishment success and hinder our ability to generate guidelines for early detection and eradication of invasive species. To overcome these limitations we have implemented a comprehensive approach that examines plant invasions at three spatial scales: regional, landscape, and local levels. At each scale, in combination with the others, we have evaluated the role of key environmental variables such as climate, landscape structure, habitat type, and canopy closure in the spread of three commonly found invasive woody plant species in New England, Berberis thunbergii, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Euonymus alatus. We developed a spatially explicit hierarchical Bayesian model that allowed us to take into account the ongoing nature of the spread of invasive species and to incorporate presence/absence data from the species' native ranges as well as from the invaded regions. Comparisons between predictions from climate-only models with those from the multiscale forecasts emphasize the importance of including landscape structure in our models of invasive species' potential distributions. In addition, predictions generated using only native range data performed substantially worse than those that incorporated data from the target range. This points out important limitations in extrapolating distributional ranges from one region to another.",

        "abstract": "Plant distributions are thought to be controlled by climate at large scales, and by non-climatic factors including soil conditions, topography and biotic interactions at smaller scales. However, not all plant distributions are explained by the current environment. Lags between current plant distributions and suitable environment for them are suggested to exist, which is often called empty habitat. To identify the existence and cause of lags between current climate and the distribution of Tsuga diversifolia, climatic conditions for the species distribution were clarified and potential habitats under current and the last glacial maximum (LGM; 21\u00a0ka) climates have been projected. The relationships between T. diversifolia distribution and climatic variables were explored using a classification tree model and a generalized additive model based on high-resolution (ca. 1\u00a0km) climatic data and a nationwide distribution database. The models were highly accurate. We revealed that T. diversifolia requires high summer precipitation even in humid Japanese environments. Areas with cool and wet summers were classified as potential habitat. Empty habitat for the focal species was identified in Hokkaido. Meanwhile, no potential habitat was projected in Hokkaido under the LGM. Additional experiments that varied temperature and summer precipitation during the LGM showed that the potential habitat was projected in Hokkaido irrespective of temperature decrease if summer precipitation increased nearly equal to the current climate. These results suggest that T. diversifolia vanished from Hokkaido, where fossil evidence indicated its occurrence until the late Neogene, during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene because of increased summer dryness.",

        "abstract": "To assess the potential distribution of Pinus\n pumila, a dominant species of the Japanese alpine zone, and areas of its habitats vulnerable to global warming, we predicted potential\n habitats under the current climate and two climate change scenarios (RCM20 and MIROC) for 2081\u20132100 using the classification\n tree (CT) model. The presence/absence records of P.\u00a0pumila were extracted from the Phytosociological Relev\u00e9 Database as response variables, and five climatic variables (warmth index,\n WI; minimum temperature for the coldest month, TMC; summer precipitation, PRS; maximum snow water equivalent, MSW; winter\n rainfall, WR) were used as predictor variables. Prediction accuracy of the CT evaluated by ROC analysis showed an AUC value\n of 0.97, being categorized as \u201cexcellent\u201d. We designated Third Mesh cells with an occurrence probability of 0.01 or greater\n as potential habitats and further divided them into suitable and marginal habitats based on the optimum threshold probability\n value (0.06) in ROC analysis. Deviance weighted scores revealed that WI was the largest contributing factor followed by MSW.\n Changes in habitat types from the current climate to the two scenarios were depicted within an observed distribution (Hayashi\u2019s\n distribution data). The area of suitable habitats under the current climate decreased to 25.0% and to 14.7% under the RCM20\n and MIROC scenarios, respectively. Suitable habitats were predicted to remain on high mountains of two unconnected regions,\n central Honshu and Hokkaido, while they were predicted to vanish in Tohoku and southwestern Hokkaido. Thus P.\u00a0pumila populations in these regions are vulnerable to climate change.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the impact of climate change on keystone subalpine conifers, Tsuga diversifolia and Abies veitchii, incorporating the uncertainties of general circulation models (GCMs) for spatial conservation planning in Japan. Potential habitats for T. diversifolia and A. veitchii under current and 20 GCMs in 2080\u20132100 were predicted using generalized additive models. We counted the number of GCMs under which current potential habitat was predicted to lose by a spatial unit and used them as indices of vulnerability and prediction uncertainty. Gaps between protected areas and potential habitats under the future climates were identified. Reasonably accurate models revealed that T. diversifolia and A. veitchii require cool and wet summers with low winter precipitation. Only less than 1\u00a0% of current potential habitats for the species were predicted to be sustainable with low GCMs-related uncertainties. Most of these certainly sustainable habitats were designated as protected areas. Of current potential habitats for T. diversifolia and A. veitchii, 88 and 97\u00a0% were predicted to be non-habitats under future climates with low GCMs-related uncertainties. These certainly vulnerable habitats included the southern and low elevated northern range limits of the species, of which 70\u00a0% were designated as protected areas. These results suggest that subalpine conifers are vulnerable to the climate change irrespective of GCMs variation. Strengthening of monitoring may be necessary, especially at unprotected and certainly vulnerable habitats in lower subalpine areas where influences of the climate change will appear first. Active management including assisted regeneration may be necessary for preserving the vulnerable and genetically endemic populations.",

        "abstract": "To quantitatively assess future change of evergreen broad-leaved tree species\u2019 distributions in human-disturbed landscapes of the Korean Peninsula under climate change, potential habitats (PHs) were projected for four important evergreen broad-leaved tree species (Quercus acuta, Castanopsis sieboldii, Machilus thunbergii, and Neolitsea sericea) by species distribution models (SDMs). The distribution data (presence/absence) of the target species in Korea and Japan were used as response variables for SDMs, and climatic data were used as explanatory variables. Three general circulation models under A2 emission scenarios were used as future climate scenarios for the years 2070\u20132099. Potential habitats masked by land-use data (PHLUs) were projected to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities. Highly accurate SDMs were obtained for all the target species. The current PHs were decreased to 21\u201335\u00a0% by the anthropogenic activities. Future PHLUs for all the target species were projected to increase by 2.0\u201318.5 times of current PHLUs. These results suggest that all the target species are applicable as indicator species for monitoring in the Korean Peninsula, even if anthropogenic effects are incorporated. Variation of the increasing rate was caused by the differences in the response to temperature changes. M. thunbergii responded sensitively to the increase of minimum temperature of coldest month and had a largest increase in PHLUs under future climate. Therefore, M. thunbergii is considered to be most appropriate species for monitoring the changes of horizontal distributions above all focal evergreen broad-leaved tree species.",

        "abstract": "Ecosystem\n vulnerability to climate change remains elusive in the species-rich Taiwan-Japan archipelago. We predicted potential habitats (PHs) of ten dominant evergreen broad-leaved tree species by using the current and twenty potential climate change scenarios using generalised additive models. The presence/absence records of each species, extracted from vegetation database, were used as response variables. Four climatic and one spatial variables were used as explanatory variables. The results showed that the interaction terms of spatial variable, indicating historical range shifts or species interactions, restricted the distribution of all the target species as much as that by the each climatic variable. The PHs of all the target species were predicted to consistently increase, and in particular, to expand northward and upward to the cool temperate zone. However, the PHs were predicted to decrease within the range of 23.6\u201338.1\u00a0% in the Ryukyu Islands for  and , respectively, and within the range of 32.4\u201342.3\u00a0% in Taiwan for  and , respectively. These findings suggest that the four species will be vulnerable at the southern range limits; however, the remaining six species will potentially increase within the PH areas in the future at all regions.",

        "abstract": "Assessing suitable climate conditions to regenerate trees over a large area is of great importance to investigate potential impacts of climate change. In this study, we developed a size-based species distribution model (SBSDM) to assess spatiotemporal changes in the tree regeneration niche separately from the growth niche in adults. Siebold\u2019s beech () was selected as the target species. We projected (1) areas where adult and juvenile potential habitats (PHs) overlapped, (2)only-adult PHs, (3) only-juvenile PHs, and (4) non-habitats for 2080\u20132099 using the SBSDM, a distribution dataset from the Phytosociological Relev\u00e9 Database of Japan, and a future climatic dataset from 24 general circulation models (GCMs). We also projected juvenile PHs for all decades between 2011 and 2099 using four representative GCMs to assess potential lost decades of the regeneration niche. The SBSDM provided sufficient projections of adult and juvenile tree distributions as well as their niche differences under the current climate. Overlapping areas and only-adult PHs were projected to decrease by the end of this century. An increase in only-juvenile PHs was projected to occur in snowy regions, with juvenile PHs starting to decrease in warm and less snowy regions. Furthermore, juvenile PHs are expected to decrease widely around 2060 as well as at the end of this century due to considerable rapid warming around those times. We conclude that regeneration of  will start to decline in 2060, but snowy conditions will postpone the timing of the regeneration loss, causing an increase in only-juvenile PHs.",

        "abstract": "Ongoing climate change and land-use change have the potential to substantially alter the distribution of large herbivores. This may result in drastic changes in ecosystems by changing plant-herbivore interactions. Here, we developed a model explaining sika deer persistence and colonization between 25\u00a0years in terms of neighborhood occupancy and habitat suitability. We used climatic, land-use, and topographic variables to calculate the habitat suitability and evaluated the contributions of the variables to past range changes of sika deer. We used this model to predict the changes in the range of sika deer over the next 100\u00a0years under four scenario groups with the combination of land-use change and climate change. Our results showed that both climate change and land-use change had affected the range of sika deer in the past 25\u00a0years. Habitat suitability increased in northern or mountainous regions, which account for 71.6% of Japan, in line with a decrease in the snow cover period. Habitat suitability decreased in suburban areas, which account for 28.4% of Japan, corresponding to land-use changes related to urbanization. In the next 100\u00a0years, the decrease in snow cover period and the increase in land abandonment were predicted to accelerate the range expansion of sika deer. Comparison of these two driving factors revealed that climate change will contribute more to range expansion, particularly from the 2070s onward. In scenarios that assumed the influence of both climate change and land-use change, the total sika deer range increased by between +4.6% and +11.9% from the baseline scenario. Climate change and land-use change will require additional efforts for future management of sika deer, particularly in the long term.",

        "abstract": "We built a classification tree (CT) model to estimate climatic factors controlling the cold temperate coniferous forest (CTCF) distributions in Yunnan province and to predict its potential habitats under the current and future climates, using seven climate change scenarios, projected over the years of 2070-2099. The accurate CT model on CTCFs showed that minimum temperature of coldest month (TMW) was the overwhelmingly potent factor among the six climate variables. The areas of TMWu003c-4.05 were suitable habitats of CTCF, and the areas of -1.35 u003c TMW were non-habitats, where temperate conifer and broad-leaved mixed forests (TCBLFs) were distribute in lower elevation, bordering on the CTCF. Dominant species of Abies, Picea, and Larix in the CTCFs, are more tolerant to winter coldness than Tsuga and broad-leaved trees including deciduous broad-leaved Acer and Betula, evergreen broad-leaved Cyclobalanopsis and Lithocarpus in TCBLFs. Winter coldness may actually limit the cool-side distributions of TCBLFs in the areas between -1.35\u00b0C and -4.05\u00b0C, and the warm-side distributions of CTCFs may be controlled by competition to the species of TCBLFs. Under future climate scenarios, the vulnerable area, where current potential (suitable + marginal) habitats (80,749 km2) shift to non-habitats, was predicted to decrease to 55.91% (45,053 km2) of the current area. Inferring from the current vegetation distribution pattern, TCBLFs will replace declining CTCFs. Vulnerable areas predicted by models are important in determining priority of ecosystem conservation.",

        "abstract": "Climate change will likely change the species composition or abundance of plant communities, and it is important to anticipate these changes to develop climate change adaptation policies. We chose beech (Fagus crenata Blume) and its competitive tree species as target species to evaluate potential turnover in forest types under climate change using a multivariate classification tree model. To construct the model, geographical presence/absence data for nine target species were used as multivariate response variables, with five climatic factors were used as predictor variables. Current and future distribution probabilities for the target species were calculated, and the 15 dominant forest types were subjectively classified in approximately 1-km2 grid cells within the area of the current beech forest distribution. All 16,398 grid cells of the beech-dominant forest type (FCR-QCR) were projected to be replaced in the future by five Quercus crispula-dominant types (59% of FCR-QCR grid cells), four Q. serrata types (22%), two Q. salicina types (8%), or two Abies firma types (0.1%). The FCR-QCR type remained unchanged (stable) in only 11.4% of grid cells; these were mainly distributed at high elevations in snowy areas on the Sea of Japan side of the country. In contrast, vulnerable habitats (future probability of beech occurrence less than 1.0%) were found at low elevations on both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean sides. Northwards or upwards range expansions or increases of Quercus spp., in particular, need to be carefully monitored.",

        "abstract": "To facilitate the adaptive management of subalpine ecosystems in the Korean Peninsula under climate change conditions, we identified the climatic factors that determine the distribution of two dominant subalpine firs (Abies koreana and A. nephrolepis). We also identified sustainable and vulnerable habitats for these species inside and outside of current protected areas under climate change scenarios. The minimum temperature of the coldest month, and the amount of precipitation in the warmest quarter were the most important climatic variables that determined the distribution of these two Abies species. Potential habitats for A. koreana and A. nephrolepis were predicted to decrease to 3.3% and 36.4% of the current areas due to climate change, irrespective of whether inside or outside the protected areas. It was predicted that the potential habitats for A. nephrolepis would be maintained in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula, and sustainable potential habitats outside the protected areas were predicted in central parts of the Korean Peninsula. The potential habitats for A. koreana were predicted to disappear from Is. Jeju and shrink significantly in the Korean Peninsula. These results suggest that, in central parts of the Korean Peninsula, revision of protected areas would be effective in preserving A. nephrolepis under conditions of future climate change. In contrast, revision of protected areas would be insufficient to conserve A. koreana due to their high vulnerability and limited populations. Active management is required to ensure the survival of A. koreana under future climate conditions.",

        "abstract": "Native forests on oceanic islands are among the most threatened ecosystems. The forests formed on Sekimon uplifted limestone in Haha-jima Island (Ogasawara Islands) have not yet been destroyed by human activities and remain as primary forests harboring several narrow endemic endangered plants. In this paper, we described the plant species diversity, community structure, and status of invasion by alien plants in the mesic forests of Sekimon. The Sekimon forest was characterized by low tree diversity (37 species), high stem density (1731\u00a0ha), and high basal area (63.9\u00a0m\u00a0ha), comparing with natural forests in world islands. The forests were dominated in the number of stems by the sub-tree Ardisia sieboldii followed by the trees Pisonia umbellifera and Elaeocarpus photiniifolius. The invasive tree Bischofia javanica ranked fourth for basal area and third for the number of stems (DBH\u2009\u2265\u200910\u00a0cm), and its distribution expanded, especially near a past plantation site. Surveys of forest floor vegetation revealed that species richness of vascular plants was 109 species and that many alien plants had already invaded the forests. Despite the low species richness of alien (16% for vascular flora and 8% for trees), the high frequency of aliens on the forest floor suggests that they have colonized successfully in the Sekimon forest. Extrapolation analysis based on the rarefaction curves predicted that the vascular plants in the Sekimon (25\u00a0ha) accounted for 135 species (29.9% of the vascular flora of the Ogasawara Islands) and endemic plants were 85 species (62.0%). The fact that the 39 vascular species recorded in our plots were listed in Japanese Red List suggests that the Sekimon forest should be conserved as a sanctuary of biodiversity. Because alien plants are invading the forests without apparent anthropogenic disturbance, immediate action to eradicate these invaders is highly needed.",

        "title": "The effects of future nationwide forest transition to discharge in the 21st century with regard to general circulation model climate change scenarios",
        "abstract": "Forest disturbance (or land-cover change) and climatic variability are commonly recognised as two major drivers interactively influencing hydrology in forested watersheds. Future climate changes and corresponding changes in forest type and distribution are expected to generate changes in rainfall runoff that pose a threat to river catchments. It is therefore important to understand how future climate changes will effect average rainfall distribution and temperature and what effect this will have upon forest types across Japan. Recent deforestation of the present-day coniferous forest and expected increases in evergreen forest are shown to influence runoff processes and, therefore, to influence future runoff conditions. We strongly recommend that variations in forest type be considered in future plans to ameliorate projected climate changes. This will help to improve water retention and storage capacities, enhance the flood protection function of forests, and improve human health. We qualitatively assessed future changes in runoff including the effects of variation in forest type across Japan. Four general circulation models (GCMs) were selected from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble to provide the driving fields: the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC), the Meteorological Research Institute Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-GCM), the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model (HadGEM), and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) climate model. The simulations consisted of an ensemble including multiple physics configurations and different reference concentration pathways (RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5), the results of which have produced monthly data sets for the whole of Japan. The impacts of future climate changes on forest type in Japan are based on the balance amongst changes in rainfall distribution, temperature and hydrological factors. Methods for assessing the impact of such changes include the Catchment Simulator modelling frameworks based on the Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO) model, which was expanded to estimate discharge by incorporating the effects of forest-type transition across the whole of Japan. The results indicated that, by the 2090s, annual runoff will increase above present-day values. Increases in annual variation in runoff by the 2090s was predicted to be around 14.1% when using the MRI-GCM data and 44.4% when using the HadGEM data. Analysis by long-term projection showed the largest increases in runoff in the 2090s were related to the type of forest, such as evergreen. Increased runoff can have negative effects on both society and the environment, including increased flooding events, worsened water quality, habitat destruction and changes to the forest moisture-retaining function. Prediction of the impacts of future climate change on water generation is crucial for effective environmental planning and management.",

        "abstract": "We studied the cytotoxic and pharmacological properties of 40 \u00b0C hyperthermia and CDDP in CDDP-sensitive (IMC-3) and CDDP-resistant (IMC-3-DDP) human maxillary carcinoma cells. Heating at 40 \u00b0C alone caused almost no cell killing to IMC-3 and IMC-3-DDP cells. In both cell lines, the dose-dependent cytotoxicity of 2-h exposures to CDDP was increased at 40 \u00b0C in comparison to 37 \u00b0C. Heating at 40 \u00b0C also potentiated CDDP cytotoxicity in both IMC-3 and IMC-3-DDP cells with thermal chemoenhancement ratios (CER) of 1.48 and 1.94, respectively. The intracellular CDDP uptake level of IMC-3-DDP at 37 \u00b0C was significantly reduced compared with IMC-3 cells. At 40 \u00b0C, however, hyperthermia increased platinum accumulation by factors of 1.4 and 1.8 in IMC-3 and IMC-3-DDP cells, respectively. These findings indicated that CDDP sensitivity was hyperthermically chemopotentiated in CDDP-resistant variants rather than in the control clones. Thus, clinical cancer chemotherapy with CDDP may be improved by an appropriate combination with hyperthermia even at 40 \u00b0C.",

        "abstract": "Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a hematopoietic cytokine, regulates the proliferation and differentiation of granulocytic progenitor cells and functionally activated mature neutrophils. G-CSF also affects nonhematopoietic tumor cells by the binding of G-CSF to its specific receptor (G-CSFR) on the cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of G-CSF on the invasive potential of head-and-neck carcinoma cells, and explored the intracellular events initiated by the binding of G-CSF in tumor cells. In vitro treatment of head-and-neck-carcinoma cell lines, IMC-2, IMC-3, KB, Ca9-22, SCCKN and SCCTF, with recombinant G-CSF (rG-CSF) significantly augmented their invasive potential in dose- and time-dependent manners. Among these cancer cells, IMC-2, IMC-3, KB and Ca9-22 cells produced little G-CSF, while large amounts of G-CSF were produced by SCCKN and SCCTF cell lines. Anti-G-CSF antibody (Ab) abrogated the rG-CSF-enhanced invasiveness to the control level of that in untreated cancer cell lines. Immunocytochemical staining and Western blotting using anti-G-CSFR monoclonal antibody (MAb) revealed the expression of G-CSFR on head-and-neck-cancer cell lines exhibiting the enhancement of invasive activity by rG-CSF. IMC-2 cells, having the highest invasive ability among the cell lines used, showed augmentation of G-CSFR expression on stimulation with rG-CSF. Furthermore, stimulation of IMC-2 cells with rG-CSF induced rapid activation of tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK1, suggesting that the G-CSF signal may be transduced into the cells through G-CSFR. Moreover, the gelatinolytic activity of IMC-2 cells was enhanced by stimulation of rG-CSF, and the enhanced invasiveness was inhibited on addition of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). These results suggest that exogenous rG-CSF may increase the risk of metastasis and/or local recurrence in patients with G-CSFR-positive head-and-neck squamous-cell carcinoma, via an invasive mechanism.",

        "abstract": "p27Kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is a negative regulator of the cell cycle, and apoptosis is a genetically encoded program of cell death. To clarify the relationship between the cell cycle and apoptosis, we investigated expression of p27, cyclin D1 and apoptosis-related proteins (p53, Bax, Bcl-2 and c-Myc) in 60 cases of oral and oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) using an immuno-histochemical approach, and evaluated spontaneous apoptosis in vivo. Our most notable finding was that spontaneous apoptosis in the p27-positive group was significantly higher than that in the p27-negative group (p = 0.028). In addition, the percentage of p27-positive cells was clearly correlated with that of Bax-positive cells (gamma = 0.288, p = 0.028) and with that of cyclin D1-positive cells (gamma = 0.416, p = 0.002). Expression of p27 was inversely associated with the clinical stage of total tumor progression (p = 0.027). However, no correlation was found between p27 expression and the following parameters: gender, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, overall survival and disease-free survival. Our results give evidence that the action of the cell-cycle regulator p27 is closely linked with apoptosis in clinical samples from patients and indicate that over-expression of p27 might induce apoptosis in cancer cells through elevation of Bax expression, thereby acting on tumor progression.",

        "abstract": "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a hematopoietic cytokine, regulates the proliferation and differentiation of granulocytic progenitor cells and functionally activated mature neutrophils. G-CSF also affects nonhematopoietic tumor cells through its binding to the specific receptor (G-CSFR) on the cells. The type IV collagenase [matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2)] is known to play a main role in the process of invasion and metastasis, but its regulation, for example, in expression or in activation, is not clearly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of G-CSF in the regulation of tumor cell invasion and the synthesis of MMP-2. G-CSFs producing the head and neck carcinoma cell line T3M-1 cells with metastatic ability and no G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) expression were transfected with G-CSFR expression vector. In vitro treatment of G-CSFR-transfectant T3M-1 cells with recombinant G-CSF (rG-CSF) significantly augmented their invasive potential in a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) system compared with that of parental cells. Moreover, MMP-2 activity of G-CSFR-transfectant T3M-1 cells was enhanced by the stimulation with rG-CSF, as assessed by gelatin zymography. These results identify G-CSF as a regulator of MMP-2 and cellular invasion.",

In 58 oral and oropharyngeal SCC, the hMSH2 positive score was inversely associated with tumor size, but not with other clinical parameters. Among five anticancer drugs (cisplatin (CDDP), 5-FU, peplomycin, mitomycin C and doxorubicin), only for CDDP was sensitivity to cytotoxicity correlated with the hMSH2 positive score. The susceptibility of hMSH2-positive tumors to CDDP killing was significantly higher than that of hMSH2-negative tumors. Immunohistochemical results regarding hMSH2 are promising in the evaluation of the sensitivity of cancer cells to CDDP cytotoxicity and enable one to select patients for adjuvant chemotherapy for oral and oropharyngeal SCC.",

        "abstract": "Tunicamycin (TM), a naturally occurring antibiotic, blocks the first step in the biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides in cells. In this study, we investigated whether changes in N-linked glycosylation affect the sensitivity of head-and-neck carcinoma cell lines to cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro treatment of the IMC-3 and KB cell lines with TM significantly decreased the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin, as determined by the MTT assay (24.15 to 10.97 microg/ml, p < 0.05). In addition, TM significantly decreased the IC50 of cisplatin against established cisplatin-resistant IMC-3/CR cells (>100 to 14.4 microg/ml, p < 0.05) to levels similar to those against parental IMC-3 cells. TM treatment decreased the number of Con A- and L-PHA-binding sites on the surface of tumor cells but had no effect on the intracellular platinum concentration. Induction of apoptosis in vitro by TM plus cisplatin in combination was increased compared with that by cisplatin alone. Furthermore, in vivo administration of TM plus cisplatin in combination significantly inhibited local tumor growth in the cisplatin-resistant in vivo C3H/He mouse model as compared with the control group (p < 0.05) and increased in vivo apoptosis of tumor cells. Our results suggest that the manipulation of glycosylation by TM in tumor cells might be a useful therapeutic strategy for successful chemotherapy using cisplatin against head-and-neck cancer.",

To maximize the interactive effect, we examined the time sequence of high (above 43 degrees C) or low (below 43 degrees C) hyperthermia and CDDP. Within the dose range of CDDP studied, there was a marked synergism between the effects of heating at 44 degrees C and subsequent CDDP exposure for 5 h. Pretreatment at 44 degrees C for 30 min or at 42 degrees C for 4 h enhanced CDDP cytotoxicity more than posttreatment at 44 degrees C for 30 min or at 42 degrees C for 4 h. However, the chemoenhancement ratio of pretreatment at 44 degrees C for 30 min was higher then that of pretreatment at 42 degrees C for 4 h, although the thermal isotoxic dose decreased the cell count to 60% under both conditions. There was a significant increase in CDDP uptake after hyperthermia at 44 degrees C. These results indicate that high hyperthermia effectively enhances subsequent CDDP cytotoxicity in human pharyngeal carcinoma KB cells.",

In vitro chemosensitivity to five chemotherapeutic agents (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, 5-fluorouracil, peplomycin, mitomycin C and Adriamycin) was tested by ATP assay and no correlation between the sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytotoxicity of any drug and MRP expression was found.

IL-8, and IL-1 receptor antagonist were determined at indicated times by ELISA. Anti IL-1beta, anti-lL-8, or anti-IL-1 receptor antagonist antiserum was given i.v. 30 minutes before hCG injection.Effects of each antiserum on the levels of the other cytokines and neutrophil accumulation, assessed by myeloperoxidase activity, were determined. Ovulation rate (rate of ruptured follicles) was also evaluated.The maximal level of IL-8 was detected at 4 hours. which preceded that of IL-1beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist, detected at 6 hours after hCG injection. Administration of anti-IL-1beta antiserum resulted in a statistically significant reduction of the peak levels of IL-8 and IL-1 receptor antagonist. Administration of anti-IL-8 antiserum reduced the accumulation of IL-1beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist. Anti-IL-1 receptor antagonist antiserum significantly augmented the accumulation of IL-1beta and IL-8. Myeloperoxidase activity was reduced by anti-IL-8 antiserum. Anti-IL-1beta and anti-lL-8 antiserum reduced the hCG-induced ovulation rate, but a synergistic effect was not evident when these antisera were injected simultaneously. Anti-IL-1 receptor antagonist antiserum had no apparent effect on ovulatory efficiency.IL-1beta, IL-8, and IL-1 receptor antagonist may affect the accumulation of related cytokines in ovaries and may be involved in ovulation.",

Although most causes of ovarian dysfunction are unclear, recent molecular techniques have clarified the subtle defects in function of the cells surrounding the oocyte. Macrophages have been identified in growing follicles of humans and rats and they promote the proliferation of granulosa cells as local mediators. A hematopoietic growth factor, colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), is produced by granulosa cells and stimulates the follicular macrophages to enhance cytokine production. In CSF-1 null mice, characterized by severely depleted macrophage populations in many tissues, the numbers of both antral and mature follicles are significantly lower, but are recovered by administration of CSF-1. We have reported that gonadotropins lead to increased human ovarian CSF-1 production and that this augmentation of CSF-1 in response to human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) administration is lost in poor responders. By concomitant administration of CSF-1 with hMG, follicle development is improved in poor responders who show low serum CSF-1 levels in the follicular phase. These women show normal responses to the examination of the growth hormone (GH) reserve. Thus, CSF-1 may be a useful therapeutic tool for selected poor responders.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the changes of macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentration in serum and compare macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentration in follicular fluid (FF) through IVF-ET cycles. Design: Sera and the matched FFs were collected serially through the IVF-ET cycles and analyzed retrospectively with respect to macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentration. Setting: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Kumamoto University Hospital. Patient(s): Ninety-four women underwent 129 cycles of ovulation induction by using GnRH agonist (GnRHa)-hMG-hCG for IVF-ET program. Intervention(s): Serum and FF macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentrations were measured by ELISA. Main Outcome Measure(s): Concentrations of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in serum and FF. Result(s): Serum macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentration was gradually increased throughout ovarian stimulation, and reached a peak from the day of oocyte retrieval to 2 days after oocyte retrieval, whereas no significant change in macrophage colony-stimulating factor was observed in cases of poor ovarian response to hMG. The macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentration in follicles was significantly higher than that in sera on the day of oocyte retrieval, and the concentrations in follicles from which oocyte could be retrieved were significantly higher than those from which oocyte could not be retrieved. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that gonadotropins lead to an increase in ovarian macrophage colony-stimulating factor production, and that this macrophage colonystimulating factor production in response to hMG administration is lost in poor ovarian responders. Thus, macrophage colony-stimulating factor may play an important role in the process of follicular maturation and ovulation as an intraovarian regulator.",

Though vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated as a prime causative factor of OHSS progression, other factors must also be involved in the pathogenesis of OHSS. We have established an experimental model of OHSS in immature female rats. The ovarian weights and vascular permeability of the OHSS model rats are significantly increased by the ovarian stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG elicits VEGF production in OHSS model rat ovaries. The addition of potent synthetic progesterone antagonist RU486, which reduces the extension of OHSS, attenuates the ovarian kinin and VEGF production dose-dependently whereas the VEGF gene expression was stable. VEGF protein detected in both the lung and the liver of the OHSS model rats is not affected at 24 h after the addition of hCG and RU486 in contrast to the ovary. Our results demonstrate that progesterone is implicated in the development of OHSS, in part, to enhance the ovarian VEGF production by post-transcriptional and organ-specific control.",

The objective of this study was to clarify the action of hCG and progesterone, one of the possible factors for OHSS, on VEGF production and gene expression using OHSS-model rats. A total of 40 immature female Wistar rats were stimulated with 10 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin for four consecutive days from the 22nd to 25th day of life followed by subcutaneous injection of 30 IU of hCG on the 26th day of life. RU486 and progesterone were injected 24 h after the hCG injection. Tissues and blood samples were collected on the 28th day. hCG elicited VEGF production in the OHSS-model rat ovaries. Ovarian weights of the OHSS model rats were significantly increased through day 26 by the ovarian stimulation with single dose of 30 IU hCG. Addition of anti-progesterone RU486, which reduced the ovarian enlargement, attenuated VEGF production dose dependently whereas the VEGF gene expression was stable. In the lung and liver, neither hCG nor RU486 affected VEGF production and gene expression. These results suggested that progesterone regulates VEGF production at the post-transcriptional level in a tissue specific manner in the hyperstimulated ovary.",

To identify oocyte-derived factors which control follicle cells as well as oocyte-controlling factors produced by follicle cells, we examined the expression of genes which contain the PTK domain in the porcine ovary, using a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification technique with degenerate oligonucleotide primers that are specific to the PTK domain. Clones for the porcine homologues of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) and of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) were found during follicle growth both in oocytes and follicle cells. Clones for the porcine homologues of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), of c-kit and of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT)-3 were found only in oocytes. Moreover, after 24 h of in-vitro maturation of the cumulus-oocyte complexes, clones for the porcine homologues of FLT-1, of FLT-4, of Tie2 and of RYK in oocytes were observed. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the existence of PDGFRalpha, platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFA), FAK and FLT3 in oocytes at various stages of folliculogenesis. These results suggest that fluctuations in the expression of these PTK genes may be involved in follicle growth and maturation.",

Serum CSF-1 concentrations were assayed on day 3. Additional studies were performed in a private IVF clinic on 27 poor responders with low serum CSF-1 levels.Pregnancy rates (PR). In addition, number of mature follicles, cycle cancellations, amount of required gonadotropins were documented.Significantly more mature follicles, fewer cycle cancellations, and lower amounts of required gonadotropins were seen in the group treated with CSF-1. Five (16.7%) pregnancies were achieved. The CSF-1-effective patients displayed significantly lower serum CSF-1 concentrations. In a private IVF clinic, CSF-1 treatment increased the number of mature oocytes, fertilized eggs, and transferred embryos. Cycle cancellations decreased from 18.5%-3.7%; 11 pregnancies (40.7%) resulted from treatment.Concomitant administration of CSF-1 and hMG improved follicle developments, especially in patients with low serum CSF-1 levels in the early follicular phase.",

Histological examinations in all six patients revealed a typical EST pattern, and in one of them another germ cell tumor, a malignant teratoma, was also found. All patients were treated postoperatively with combination chemotherapy. The serum alpha FP concentrations before treatment, using radioimmunoassay, were abnormally high and ranged from 2500 to 100,000 ng/ml. One patient having Stage Ia neoplasm is living at 50 months after diagnosis with a normal alpha FP concentration and without clinical evidence of recurrence. The other five patients with Stage III disease died from 4 to 9 months after surgery, respectively, although the serum alpha FP in all these cases during chemotherapy decreased markedly but temporarily to a normal level (less than 20 ng/ml) or to 3000 ng/ml and was paralleled by a certain improvement in the conditions of the disease. These results suggest that serial serum determination of alpha FP may be useful as a marker and prognostic indicator of endodermal sinus tumor.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate a possible participation of the kinin-kallikrein system (KKS) in the pathophysiology of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Symptoms of hyperstimulation were produced in immature female rats using equine chorionic gonadotrophin followed by human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). At 48 h after the HCG injection, rats were injected s.c. with 100 microg/kg of HOE140, bradykinin-2 receptor antagonist. Capillary permeability was evaluated using peritoneal Evans blue dye (EB) concentrations 30 min after the i.v. injections. The EB concentrations in the hyperstimulated rats were significantly reduced 4 and 6 h after the HOE140 injection, compared with those injected with the vehicle as a control (4.58+/-0.80 versus 8.22+/-0.87 and 4.32+/-0.74 versus 8.35+/-1.03 microg respectively; P < 0.03), indicating the involvement of kinin in the pathophysiology of OHSS in this model. The administration of 10 IU aprotinin significantly reduced the peritoneal EB concentration when compared with the control (4.13+/-0.53 versus 7.95+/-1.06 microg; P < 0.01), implicating a possible role of kallikrein. Furthermore, pretreatment with RU486 (5 or 10 mg/kg) resulted in a significant reduction of ovarian kinin concentrations 48 h after the HCG injection, compared with the control (1.22+/-0.07 or 1.43+/-0.07 versus 1.94+/-0.10 pg/mg; P < 0.005 and P < 0.05 respectively). Similar results were obtained in the peritoneal EB concentrations. In addition, a significant correlation between the ovarian kinin and peritoneal EB concentrations was observed (P < 0.001, r = 0.539). Thus it was suggested that ovarian KKS plays an intermediary role in the progesterone-induced augmentation of capillary permeability in this experimental model, indicating the involvement of KKS in the pathophysiology of OHSS.",

        "abstract": "To determine whether angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression and tumor angiogenesis in human bladder cancer (BCa) specimens acquired by transurethral resection (TUR). It has recently been reported that AT1R is expressed in several tumors and is involved in tumor angiogenesis. However, no study has investigated AT1R expression in association with angiogenesis in clinical specimens of bladder cancer.Surgical specimens were obtained from 108 patients who had undergone TUR for bladder cancer. All specimens were pathologically diagnosed as urothelial carcinoma. AT1R expression and microvessel density (MVD) were determined by immunostaining. The clinical and pathologic characteristics were retrospectively reviewed.The MVD was greater in muscle-invasive BCa (MIBC; 29 cases, 34.4 \u00b1 4.1/0.25 mm(2)) than in non-MIBC (NMIBC; 79 cases, 17.4 \u00b1 1.1/0.25 mm(2), P < .0001). AT1R expression was greater in the MIBC (P = .0004) and high-grade (P = .0063) specimens than in the NMIBC and low-grade specimens. In addition, the greater expression of AT1R was significantly associated with MVD (P < .05). In NMIBC, the factors significantly affecting recurrence-free survival on univariate analysis were AT1R (P = .02), MVD (P < .0001), tumor multiplicity (P = .0007), and bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin intravesical instillation after TUR (P = .0026). Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor multiplicity and no BCG intravesical instillation after TUR were independent predictors of 5-year recurrence-free survival, and AT1R and MVD were independent predictors of 1-year recurrence-free survival (P < .01).AT1R expression and MVD were related to early intravesical recurrence in NMIBC. The results suggest that AT1R could become a new molecular target and a prognostic factor for NMIBC.",

        "abstract": "Patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer usually experience multiple instances of tumor recurrence until stage progression occurs. However, it has not yet been fully evaluated whether the timing and/or pattern of tumor recurrence could affect subsequent stage progression. We examined whether the frequency of tumor recurrence provides additional predictive information concerning stage progression.A total of 484 patients with initially diagnosed nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer were identified between 1985 and 2006 at our institution. Median followup was 7.2 years. Frequency of tumor recurrence was analyzed to determine if it affected subsequent stage progression.Of these patients 40 (8.3%) experienced stage progression during followup. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis subsequent stage progression could be most strongly predicted in patients with a recurrence rate of 1 or more per year during the first 2 years, although similar results were observed for various cutoff periods and recurrence rates. The 10-year progression-free survival rate was 58.0% in patients with a recurrence rate of 1 or more per year and 93.3% in their counterparts (p <0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the appearance of tumor grade 3 (p = 0.027, risk ratio 2.36), carcinoma in situ (p = 0.045, risk ratio 2.44) and a recurrence rate of 1 or more per year during the first 2 years (p <0.001, risk ratio 7.40) were independent risk factors for subsequent stage progression.Frequency of tumor recurrence is a strong predictor of subsequent stage progression in patients initially diagnosed with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. More appropriate followup and aggressive treatment due to a higher malignant potential for stage progression might be recommended in patients with a recurrence rate of 1 or more per year during the first 2 years.",

We investigated the prognostic impact of RAS inhibitors by analysing data from patients with upper-tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).A total of 279 patients who underwent nephroureterectomy for localised UTUC (pTa-3N0M0) were identified at our three institutions. We retrospectively investigated the prognostic outcomes following nephroureterectomy in patients administered or not administered ACEIs or ARBs.The median follow-up period was 3.4 years. RAS inhibitors were administered to 48 patients (17.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that the appearance of pathological T3, positive lymphovascular invasion, and no RAS inhibitor administration (P=0.027 HR=3.14) were independent risk factors for a decrease in subsequent metastasis-free survival. The 5-year metastasis-free survival rate was 93.0% in patients who administered RAS inhibitors, and 72.8% in their counterparts who did not (P=0.008).The absence of RAS inhibitor administration was an independent risk factor for subsequent tumour metastasis in patients with localised UTUC. We propose RAS inhibitors may be a potent choice as an effective treatment following nephroureterectomy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose We investigated whether smoking cessation could have preventative effects against tumor recurrence in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Methods Our study population comprised 634 patients with initially diagnosed NMIBC at Keio University Hospital, Saiseikai Central Hospital, and Saitama Medical University Hospital between 1995 and 2012. We analyzed the relationships between tumor recurrence in NMIBC and patient clinicopathological parameters, including smoking status. Results Overall, 181 patients (28.5 %) were classified as current smokers, 154 (24.3 %) as former smokers, and 299 (47.2 %) as non-smokers. Kaplan\u2013Meier curve analysis revealed that the tumor recurrence rate was significantly lower in the non-smoker group than in the current- and former-smoker groups (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). In the 154 former smokers, Kaplan\u2013Meier curve analysis revealed that smoking intensity and duration was not associated with tumor recurrence rate; however, patients with a smoking cessation period of 15 years or more had a significantly lower tumor recurrence rate than their counterparts (p < 0.001). A multivariate analysis identified a smoking cessation period of <15 years (hazard ratio [HR] 2.20; p = 0.003) and T1 tumors (HR 1.99; p = 0.013) as independent risk factors for tumor recurrence in the former-smokers subgroup. Conclusions A positive smoking history was identified as one of the independent risk factors for bladder tumor recurrence after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor. Furthermore, refraining from smoking for 15 years or more reduced the risk of tumor recurrence in former smokers with NMIBC regardless of the intensity or duration of smoking. Therefore, smoking cessation may reduce the risk of tumor recurrence in patients with NMIBC.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the recurrence and progression in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors who remained tumor-free for at least 5 years, which should assist in the development of schedules of their follow-up evaluations. Non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors that recur or progress at a late time point are not rare.Between 1985 and 2002, 814 cases diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer were treated with transurethral resection. Of these 814 cases, 262 patients with no tumor recurrence for more than 5 years were included in the study. The median follow-up interval was 10.0 years.During the follow-up period, 39 tumors (14.9%) showed tumor recurrence. The 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival rates were 81.6% and 76.0%, respectively. There was no significant difference in tumor recurrence among the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on the current clinical guideline. Only the use of intravesical mitomycin C was determined to be a significant unfavorable risk factor for late recurrence. Five patients (1.9%) experienced stage progression, 3 of whom did not have metastases at the time of diagnosis of the progression but died because of bladder cancer disease.After a 5-year tumor-free period, even in the low-risk group, recurrence occurred at a late time point to a degree that was the same as that for the intermediate- and high-risk groups. Finally, some of the high-risk patients experienced late progression with a high degree of malignant behavior, suggesting longer follow-up is needed for each patient.",

        "abstract": "Continued smoking is highly associated with not only a higher incidence but also greater risk of tumor recurrence, progression, and acquired chemoresistance of urothelial carcinoma. We investigated whether nicotine affects urothelial carcinoma, and the detailed mechanism by which nicotine could induce tumor growth and any associated chemoresistance. Cell viability was evaluated in the human bladder cancer cell line T24 exposed to nicotine with or without cisplatin (CDDP) and NVP-BEZ235 as a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor by WST-1 assay. Protein expression of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was investigated by Western blot or immunohistochemical analysis. The influence of nicotine on tumor growth was also evaluated with or without CDDP and/or NVP-BEZ235 in a subcutaneous bladder tumor model. The result demonstrated that cell proliferation was increased in T24 cells after exposure to nicotine. Phospho-specific Akt (pAkt) and phospho-specific p70 S6 kinase (pS6) were significantly up-regulated by nicotine exposure. Tumor growth in vivo was significantly induced by nicotine exposure in accordance with increased pS6 expression. Nicotine attenuated inhibition of T24 cell growth by CDDP and further up-regulated pS6 expression in vitro and in vivo. NVP-BZE235 inhibited T24 cell proliferation and pAkt and pS6 expression induced after exposure to nicotine and/or CDDP. In conclusion, nicotine increases tumor growth and induces acquired chemoresistance through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in bladder cancer.",

        "abstract": "Cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemotherapy is the gold standard treatment for many types of cancer. However, the phenotypic hallmark of tumors often changes after CDDP treatment, with the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and platinum resistance. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which cancer cells acquire EMT under the control of CDDP remain unclear. Following an investigation of urothelial carcinoma (UC) before and after the acquisition of platinum resistance, we offer the new target TNFAIP2, which led to EMT and tumor invasion in platinum-treated UC cells. TNFAIP2 expression in cancer was examined at the protein and transcriptional levels. A potential target for TNFAIP2 during EMT was assessed by microarray. Clinically, upregulated TNFAIP2 expression was identified as a significant predictor of mortality following surgery in three different cohorts of patients with UC (n\u2009=\u2009156, n\u2009=\u2009119, and n\u2009=\u200954). Knockdown of TNFAIP2 resulted in upregulation of E-cadherin expression and downregulation of TWIST1 expression, which decreased motile function in platinum-resistant UC cells. TNFAIP2 overexpression led to downregulation of E-cadherin expression and upregulation of TWIST1 expression in platinum-na\u00efve UC cells. Clinical investigation of matched pre- and post-CDDP-treated UC sections confirmed upregulation of TNFAIP2 expression in CDDP-treated tumors but downregulation of E-cadherin expression. Global gene expression analysis following TNFAIP2 knockdown identified MTDH as a positive regulator of TNFAIP2-derived EMT acquisition in cancer cells. The present results suggest a relationship between TNFAIP2 and EMT in cancers under the control of CDDP, in which MTDH expression levels in cancer cells are vital for promoting TNFAIP2-derived EMT acquisition.",

        "abstract": "We analyzed the prognostic impact of hydronephrosis grade on disease specific survival and evaluated whether hydronephrosis grade could preoperatively predict worse pathological outcomes in cases of upper tract urothelial carcinoma treated surgically.We identified and retrospectively reviewed the records of 91 patients who were evaluated by multidetector computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively, and treated with nephroureterectomy at our institution from 2000 to 2009. Ipsilateral hydronephrosis was graded 0 to 4 by 2 urological radiologists blinded to clinical outcomes. We analyzed the associations between hydronephrosis grade, and pathological findings and patient outcomes.Preoperatively 67 patients (73.6%) had ipsilateral hydronephrosis. Grade was 1 to 4 in 3 (3.3%), 17 (18.7%), 23 (25.3%) and 24 cases (26.4%), respectively. Higher hydronephrosis grade was significantly associated with a ureteral tumor (p = 0.0307), higher pT stage (p = 0.0002) and lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.0014). Higher hydronephrosis grade was not associated with disease specific or metastasis-free survival. On preoperative multivariate analysis high hydronephrosis grade predicted pathological T stage (T3 or greater) (HR 4.98, p = 0.0228), positive lymphovascular invasion (HR 6.37, p = 0.0022) and grade 3 (HR 2.98, p = 0.0311).On image analysis preoperative hydronephrosis grade was associated with features of aggressive disease and predicted an advanced pathological outcome in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. This information could prove useful to select candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and make decisions concerning surgical options.",

        "abstract": "Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is widely used in the clinic to effectively treat superficial urinary bladder cancer. However, a significant proportion of patients who fail to respond to BCG risk cystectomy or death. Though more than 3 million cancer treatments with BCG occur annually, surprisingly little is known about the initial signaling cascades activated by BCG. Here, we report that BCG induces a rapid intracellular Ca signal in bladder cancer cells that is essential for activating the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) and for synthesizing and secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 8 (IL-8). A similar Ca response was observed when cells were exposed to the supernatant of BCG. Studying cellular molecular mechanisms involved in the BCG signaling event, we found pivotal roles for phospholipase C and the Toll-like receptor 4. Further assessment revealed that this signaling pathway induces synthesis of IL-8, whereas exocytosis appeared to be controlled by global Ca signaling. These results shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying BCG treatment of bladder cancer, which can help in improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing adverse side effects.",

        "abstract": "Cancers acquire resistance to systemic treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (eg, cisplatin [CDDP]) as a result of a dynamic intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and clonal repopulation. However, little is known about the influence of chemotherapy on ITH at the single-cell level. Here, mapping the transcriptome of cancers treated with CDDP by scRNA-seq, we uncovered a novel gene, COX7B, associated with platinum-resistance, and surrogate marker, CD63. Knockdown of COX7B in cancer cells decreased the sensitivity of CDDP whereas overexpression recovered the sensitivity of CDDP. Low COX7B levels correlated with higher mortality rates in patients with various types of cancer and were significantly associated with poor response to chemotherapy in urinary bladder cancer. Tumor samples from patients, who underwent CDDP therapy, showed decreased COX7B protein levels after the treatment. Analyzing scRNA-seq data from platinum-na\u00efve cancer cells demonstrated a low-COX7B subclone that could be sorted out from bulk cancer cells by assaying CD63. This low-COX7B subclone behaved as cells with acquired platinum-resistance when challenged to CDDP. Our results offer a new transcriptome landscape of platinum-resistance that provides valuable insights into chemosensitivity and drug resistance in cancers, and we identify a novel platinum resistance gene, COX7B, and a surrogate marker, CD63.",

        "abstract": "To identify the molecules involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in urothelial carcinoma (UC) after acquisition of platinum resistance, here we examined the changes in global gene expression before and after platinum treatment. Four invasive UC cell lines, T24, 5637, and their corresponding sublines T24PR and 5637PR with acquired platinum resistance, were assessed by microarray, and the ubiquitin E3 ligase FBXO32 was newly identified as a negative regulator of EMT in UC tumors after acquisition of platinum resistance. In vitro and in vivo studies showed an intimate relationship between FBXO32 expression and EMT, demonstrating that FBXO32 dysregulation in T24PR cells results in elevated expression of the mesenchymal molecules SNAIL and vimentin and decreased expression of the epithelial molecule E-cadherin. The association between FBXO32 expression and EMT was further validated using clinical samples. Knockdown of MyoD expression, a specific target of FBXO32 polyubiquitination, revealed upregulation of E-cadherin expression and downregulation of SNAIL and vimentin expression in T24PR cells. Comparative genomic hybridization array analysis demonstrated loss of heterozygosity at 8q24.13 in T24PR cells, which harbors FBXO32. Our findings suggest the importance of the association between EMT and ubiquitin-proteasome regulation when tumors develop acquired platinum resistance.",

We identified 458 patients (937 ureters) who underwent open RC for bladder cancer at our 7 Japanese institutions between 2004 and 2015. Among these patients, 139 (284 ureters) received NAC before RC (NAC group), while 319 (653 ureters) underwent RC alone (non-NAC group). FSA was performed on 356 out of 937 (38.0%) ureters and 179 out of 458 (39.1%) patients. FSA was positive in 30 out of 356 (8.4%) ureters and its sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 89.3, 98.5, and 97.8%, respectively. In the NAC group, FSA was performed on 138 out of 284 (48.6%) ureters and 68 out of 139 (48.9%) patients. FSA was positive in 8 out of 138 ureters (5.8%), and its sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 77.8, 99.2, and 97.8%, respectively. In the non-NAC group, FSA was performed on 218 out of 653 (33.4%) ureters and 111 out of 319 (34.8%) patients. FSA was positive in 22 out of 218 (10.1%) ureters, and its sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 94.7, 98.0, and 97.7%, respectively. No correlation was observed between preoperative clinical factors and FSA positivity in the NAC group; however, in the non-NAC group, the incidence of FSA positivity in the ureters of patients with concomitant CIS in TUR-BT specimens was 8/41 (19.5%), which was significantly higher than that in their counterpart (14/177, 7.9%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.033). Even in the era of NAC in the management of bladder cancer patients, the performance of FSA does not change and FSA at the time of RC may provide useful diagnostic information.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Purpose  The International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk model has been designed for prognostification in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated with targeted therapy. One factor is neutrophil count; however, increasing evidence has suggested the superiority of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for predicting outcome. In this study, we evaluate the prognostic effect of NLR levels on patients with mRCC treated with targeted therapy, and then we compare the predictive accuracy of the IMDC risk model and its modified one by using NLR, instead of neutrophil count.    Patients and method  A total of 277 patients are included for the analysis. All patients underwent targeted therapies and associated outcome are assessed using multivariate analysis.    Results  Pretreatment NLR levels are elevated in 30.3% and 23.1% of patients in the first-line and subsequent second-line setting, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves reveal that elevated pretreatment NLR is significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) since first-line ( P  P     Conclusion  Changes in NLR levels could be predictive for prognosis in patients with mRCC treated with first-line and second-line targeted therapy. The addition of NLR significantly improves the predictive accuracy of the IMDC risk model in the first-line and subsequent second-line setting.",

        "title": "MP90-09 A NEW STRATEGY FOR THE TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER BY TARGETING VASOHIBIN-2",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Recently, we isolated a novel angiogenic molecule, vasohibin-2 (VASH2) which is an intrinsic factor specifically expressed in activated vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Previous studies found that the expression of VASH2 was restricted to ECs and tumor cells. Although VASH2 promoting the angiogenesis in several cancers have been investigated, it has not been fully characterized yet that the VASH2 reflects the activity of tumor and the predictor of progression in prostate cancer (Pca). The aim of this study was to address the role of VASH2 expression and the treatment by targeting VASH2 in Pca. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of patients with localized Pca performed radical prostatectomy and immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of VASH2. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of VASH2 in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVEC) and Pca cell lines. The cell viability of these cells treated with anti-VASH2 antibody (V2-Ab) was determined by using the WST-1 assay. DU145 was injected subcutaneously in BALB/c nude mice and then V2-Ab was injected intraperitoneally in mice. RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 5.6 years. The expression of VASH2 was observed to ECs of microvessels in the tumor stroma and Pca cells. The density of VASH2 positive vessels were significantly associated with Gleason score and pathological T stage (pu003c0.05). High VASH2 density was significantly associated with preoperative PSA (p1\u204440.012), T stage (p1\u204440.026), and the intensity of VASH2 positive tumor cells (p1\u204440.048). The PSA recurrence-free survival rate was significantly worse in high VASH2 group than in low VASH2 group (p1\u204440.019). We showed that the protein level of VASH2 in HUVEC and DU145 was higher than that of the Pca cell lines (LNCap, C4-2). WST-1 assay indicated that the treatment with V2-Ab caused a decreased cell proliferation of HUVEC (67%, pu003c0.001) and DU145 (80%, p1\u204440.017) at high dose. We examined time course changes in DU145 tumor growth in mice. The average tumor size in the V2-Ab treatment group and in the control group on day 27 was 85mm and 389mm, respectively (p1\u204440.007). CONCLUSIONS: The present study clearly demonstrates VASH2 have the cell apoptosis mediated by V2-Ab. The results suggest that VASH2 could become a new therapeutic target in patients with CRPC.",

Transferrin receptor (TfR) is expressed in proliferating\n cells and regarded as a tumor marker. In human carcinoma cell lines (HeLa cells, KB cells, and HSC-7 cells), significantly\n more microvilli were observed in the subconfluent phase than in the confluent phase. Also, TfR was found along the plasma\n membranes, especially well developed microvilli, coated pits, and coated vesicles in both phases by the immunoelectron microscopic\n method. These results indicate that the proliferative ability of the tumor cells might correlate with the development of microvilli.",

In patients with cervical metastasis, microvilli were developed and a small number of desmosomes were found, regardless of the width of the intercellular spaces. In patients without the metastasis, few microvilli were found in relatively wide intercellular spaces, or numerous microvilli were found in narrow intercellular spaces, and a large number of desmosomes were shown. However, these findings were different from those of tumors that had received radiotherapy, in which numerous microvilli and a small number of desmosomes were found in the nonmetastatic cases. Transferrin receptor, which is a marker of cell proliferation, was localized on the cell membrane, especially in microvilli. Ultrastructural similarity between the primary tumor and the metastatic tumor was recognized, however, the features of microvilli, desmosomes, and the intercellular spaces differed between them in most cases. It is suggested that microvilli might be related to the metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Immunohistochemically, the protein expression of p53 and pRb2/p130 was related to the clinical course of the patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma; the mechanism of the synthesis of these proteins should be investigated in order to understand the biological behavior of the tumor.",

Granular or globular structures and pyramid structures were found on the surface of the calculi, and in some cases a scaly structure corresponding to fiber and bacteria was recognized. X-ray microanalysis showed the main constitutes of the calculi to be Ca and P. Transmission electron microscopic examination revealed a fine fibrous structure near the degenerated organelles, and analyses of the structure by electron diffraction revealed hydroxyapatite. Calcification was found around the degenerative organelles in the form of lipid-like structures, mitochondria, lysosomes, and microbial structures. Judging from our results, as one of the processes leading to calculi formation, it is speculated that degenerative substances are emitted by saliva, by some phenomenon, and calcification around these substances then occurs, contributing to the formation of calculi.",

We studied the clinical and pathologic features of nine cases of this tumor to define diagnostic criteria and estimate prognoses for 2 different types of AOMM.Nine patients with 2 different types of primary AOMM were examined between 1970 and 2002. The histopathology of surgical specimens was studied, uncertain diagnoses were supported by immunohistochemical reactions, and electron microscopy and prognoses were reviewed retrospectively.AOMM without radial growth phase may be particularly difficult to diagnose correctly without immunohistochemical assistance. Tumors consisted of a mixture of polygonal and spindle cells in different ratios in tumors with and without radial growth phase. The life span ranged from 3 months to 6 years 3 months, and all 9 patients died of the tumor. In 7 of the 9 cases, distant metastases were found.AOMM without radial growth phase may be misdiagnosed as epulis or squamous cell carcinoma. Questionable lesions, particularly maxillary and palatal lesions, must be biopsied for histopathologic and possibly immunohistochemical examinations followed by rapid treatment. The prognosis of AOMM was poor.",

We did an immunohistochemical study of TfR in oral tissues and a quantitative analysis by flow cytometry of TfR in a cancer cell line after an anticancer drug treatment. TfR was found in the parabasal and basal layers of the normal epithelium, but rarely in benign tumors. Generally, in the malignant tumors, the poor prognostic cases showed strong staining regardless of the differentiation of the tumor. In the flow cytometric analysis, the amount of TfR decreased according to the reduction of the proliferative ability of cancer cells. These results suggest that TfR expression may be useful as a prognostic marker.",

Study design. Medical records of 105 patients less than 15 years of age who were treated for oral and maxillofacial tumors during the 20 years between 1976 and 1997 were retrieved and analyzed.Of the 105 cases, 102 (97.1%) involved tumors that were benign; only 3 patients (2.9%) had tumors that were malignant. With regard to benign soft tissue tumor, the most common type was hemangioma (25/69; 36.2%), the second most common type was papilloma (19/69; 27.5%), and the most common site was the tongue. With regard to bone tumor, the most common type was odontoma (14/33; 42.4%), the second most common type was ameloblastoma (11/33; 33.3%), and the most common site was the mandible. Most of the odontogenic tumors (25/28; 89.3%) developed in patients more than 6 years of age; these tumors may develop after dental crown formation. In each case of benign soft tissue tumor, resection was performed; 4 of these tumors (2 hemangiomas, 1 lymphangioma, and 1 papilloma) recurred, but after re-resection recurrence has not been found for more than 4 years. In the cases of benign jawbone tumor, resection and enucleation were the procedures principally performed; 3 ameloblastomas recurred after enucleation, but after relatively wide resection for these recurrent tumors there has been no recurrence for more than 17 years. With regard to the ameloblastomas, enucleation with preservation of the periosteum was effective and bone regeneration occurred rapidly.Most oral and maxillofacial tumors in children are benign. In any case of such benign tumor, including ameloblastoma, minimal surgical treatment should be the procedure of first choice.",

No difference of tumor size (T classification) or pathological findings between the metastatic group and the nonmetastatic group was found. The metastatic cases had numerous microvilli and a small number of desmosomes regardless of the width of the intercellular spaces. The nonmetastatic cases had few microvilli in relatively wide intercellular spaces, or, in the cases in which numerous microvilli were present in the narrow intercellular spaces, the tumor cells were connected by a large number of desmosomes. Transferrin receptor, which is a marker of cell proliferation, was localized in the cell membrane by immunohistochemistry and especially in microvilli by immunoelectron microscopy. It is suggested that microvilli might be related to the proliferation and the metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma cells.",

        "abstract": "The sternocleidomastoid (SCM) myocutaneous flap remains an important tool in head and neck reconstruction. This article retrospectively reviews 40 consecutive SCM myocutaneous flaps used for the reconstruction after resection of oral squamous cell carcinoma with respect to reliability and complications.From 1987 to 1997, 40 patients underwent SCM myocutaneous flap reconstruction of the oral cavity. The age and gender of the patients, site of primary tumor TNM stage, type of associated operation, and clinical course were analyzed.In 8 cases, partial epithelial loss over the skin paddle occurred with survival of the muscle and at least some of the dermis. Unilateral supraomohyoid neck dissection (SND) was performed in 11 cases, and unilateral functional neck dissection, which preserves SCM and/or internal jugular vein and/or accessory nerve, in 16 cases. Pathologically positive nodes were recognized in 14 of these 27 neck dissection cases; in 11 of these 14 cases, the neck lesion was controlled.The SCM myocutaneous flap appears to be simple to use and useful for reconstruction of the defect after resection of oral carcinoma, and the indications for this flap will be extended in accordance with the recent increases in the number of supraomohyoid and functional neck dissection cases.",

The number of different sports was 19, with the incidence of the fractures being most common in rugby and skiing, followed by baseball and soccer. The ratio of males to females was 5.5:1, and most of the patients were between 10 and 29 years of age. Total restriction from sports activity was between 8 and 12 weeks after initial treatment.The treatment for sports-related maxillofacial fractures is not different from that for fractures from other causes. However, it is important to establish some standard for deciding the time when it is possible to participate in sports after a fracture.",

        "abstract": "Cell-cycle checkpoints controlling the orderly progression through mitosis are frequently disrupted in human cancers. One such checkpoint, entry into metaphase, is regulated by the CHFR gene encoding a protein possessing forkhead-associated and RING finger domains as well as ubiquitin-ligase activity. Although defects in this checkpoint have been described, the molecular basis and prevalence of CHFR inactivation in human tumors are still not fully understood. To address this question, we analyzed the pattern of CHFR expression in a number of human cancer cell lines and primary tumors. We found CpG methylation-dependent silencing of CHFR expression in 45% of cancer cell lines, 40% of primary colorectal cancers, 53% of colorectal adenomas, and 30% of primary head and neck cancers. Expression of CHFR was precisely correlated with both CpG methylation and deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the CpG-rich regulatory region. Moreover, CpG methylation and thus silencing of CHFR depended on the activities of two DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3b, as their genetic inactivation restored CHFR expression. Finally, cells with CHFR methylation had an intrinsically high mitotic index when treated with microtubule inhibitor. This means that cells in which CHFR was epigenetically inactivated constitute loss-of-function alleles for mitotic checkpoint control. Taken together, these findings shed light on a pathway by which mitotic checkpoint is bypassed in cancer cells and suggest that inactivation of checkpoint genes is much more widespread than previously suspected.",

Three weeks after the implantation, mandibular sections containing the implants were retrieved with the use of a bone saw and investigated by light and electron microscopy, X-ray microanalyzer, and electron diffraction. Scanning electron microscopic observation showed titanium particles on the implant-bone interface, and investigation by microanalyzer revealed titanium not only on the implant-bone interface but also in the bone tissue. Transmission electron microscopic observation and investigation by electron diffraction showed titanium in the bone matrix and cells other than macrophages. In this study, titanium particles from the dental implant were recognized morphologically in the surrounding bone tissue.

To assess the prevalence of Wnt signaling, we examined beta-catenin mutation and its immunohistochemical protein expression in oral cancers. The results were linked with expression of cyclin D1, one of the target genes of Wnt signaling, expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) relevant to beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation, Ki-67 labeling index, clinicopathological features, and survival. In the analysis based on membranous expression of beta-catenin, 75 (68.2%) of 110 cases showed a reduced membranous pattern, and the remaining 35 (31.8%) had a preserved membranous pattern similar to that in oral epithelium. In the analysis of another category of beta-catenin expression, a cytoplasmic/nuclear pattern was observed in 21 (19.1%) of the 110 tumors. Most (19/21, 90.5%) of these tumors had a concomitant reduction of membranous expression of beta-catenin. The reduced membranous or cytoplasmic/nuclear pattern of beta-catenin was significantly associated with an invasive growth pattern, EGFR expression, an increased Ki-67 labeling index, and shorter survival but not with cyclin D1 expression. Mutational analyses of beta-catenin were performed for 39 cases, including the 21 tumors with a cytoplasmic/nuclear pattern, but no mutations in the beta-catenin gene exon 3 were detected in these samples. Our data indicate that altered expression of beta-catenin may play an important role in tumor progression through increased proliferation and invasiveness under EGFR activation. However, mutations of beta-catenin do not appear to be responsible for tumor development and abnormal expression of beta-catenin in oral cancers.",

        "abstract": "pRb2/p130 is one of the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene family and a suppressor oncogene. Immunohistochemically, the expression of pRb2/p130 was reported to be correlated inversely with the degree of malignancy in lung carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma. In the current study, the correlation between expression of pRb2/p130 and clinicopathologic factors in oral squamous cell carcinoma was investigated.One hundred twenty-two specimens from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma were investigated by staining with a polyclonal antibody against pRb2/p130. The correlation between the expression of pRb2/p130 and various clinicopathologic factors was studied.Positive staining for pRb2/p130 was observed in 61 of 122 cases (50.0%). pRb2/p130 expression was found to be correlated significantly with clinical stage (P = 0.050), cervical lymph node metastasis (P = 0.035), and tumor differentiation (P = 0.050). In the entire group a significantly reduced 5-year cumulative survival rate was observed in patients with pRb2/p130-negative tumors compared with patients whose tumors positively expressed pRb2/p130 (P = 0.0004). When tested with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the most significant independent prognostic factor for the entire group of 122 patients was found to be pRb2/p130 expression.Expression of pRb2/p130 may be a good prognostic indicator in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma and also may be utilized for the subclassification of tumors with the Grade 3 mode of carcinoma invasion.",

Survival curve of the cells was investigated by the colony formation assay. X-irradiation with 2, 4, and 8 Gy was performed against the cell line. Morphological changes of the cells at 6, 24, 72, and 120h after irradiation were examined by both light and electron microscopy. The survival curve of the SSM-1 cells showed higher radiosensitivity than that of cutaneous melanoma cell lines. Giant cells and multinucleated cells were found only 120h after 8Gy irradiation. Ultrastructural observation revealed changes in nucleus and melanosomes; melanosomes increased in number at 120h after 8Gy irradiation. Further alterations after irradiation were noticed primarily in the nucleus. Radiosensitivity of the SSM-1 cell line derived from oral malignant melanoma was higher than that of cutaneous melanoma cell lines. The results of this study may support the concept that radiotherapy is effective for oral malignant melanoma.",

        "abstract": "This retrospective review presents our experience of oral and maxillofacial tumours in children. The subjects were 250 children under the age of 15 years (out of a total of 2747 patients with oral and maxillofacial tumours), who were treated after histopathological confirmation of their diagnoses during the 28 years 1965-92. Diagnosis, incidence, and age at presentation were the main outcome measures and the results showed that 232 patients (93%) had benign tumours and 18 (7%) were malignant. The most common benign tumour was haemangioma (n = 69) and the most common malignant tumour sarcoma (n = 14). The most common odontogenic tumour was odontoma (n = 47) and non-odontogenic tumour ossifying fibroma (n = 5). The most common site of soft tissue tumours was the tongue (n = 65) and of bony tumours the mandible (n = 62). About a third of the tumours developed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years. Most of the angiomas developed in patients less than 6 years old, and most of the ameloblastomas in those over 12 years of age. Children accounted for 55% of patients with lymphangoma, 41% of those with odontoma, and 22% of those with haemangioma. It is concluded that most of these lesions were probably developmental malformations rather than neoplasms, and that the definition of oral and maxillofacial tumours in children should be reconsidered.",

        "abstract": "Sialolithiasis is one of the common diseases of the salivary glands. It was speculated that, in the process of calculi formation, degenerative substances are emitted by saliva and calcification then occurs around these substances, and finally calculi are formed. However, the exact mechanism of the formation of calculi is still unclear. In this study, we identify some possible etiologies of calculi formation in salivary glands through biophysical analysis. Calculi from 13 patients with submandibular sialolithiasis were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray microanalyzer, and electron diffraction. Transmission electron microscopic observation of calculi was performed in the submandibular gland (n = 13). In 3 of the 13 cases, a number of mitochondria-like structures and lysosomes were found near calcified materials. Scanning electron microscopic examination of these materials revealed that there were lamellar and concentric structures and that the degree of calcification was different among the calculi. X-ray microanalysis disclosed the component elements in the calculi to be Ca, P, S, Na, etc., and the main constituents were Ca and P. The calcium-to-phosphorus ratio was 1.60-1.89. Analysis of the area including mitochondria-like structures, lysosomes, and the fibrous structures by electron diffraction revealed the presence of hydroxyapatite and calcified materials. It is speculated that mitochondria and lysosomal bodies from the ductal system of the submandibular gland are an etiological source for calcification in the salivary gland.",

Clinically the melanomas were classified into five types; however, there were no histopathological differences according to these clinical types. Electron microscopic observation of the melanomas and primary culture cells derived from oral malignant melanoma revealed that, in patients whose prognoses were relatively good, many mature-stage melanosomes were found. Immunohistologically, there was a positive reaction for transferrin receptor and the expression of pRb2/p130 was found in only 2 of 13 patients, who are still alive after periods of over 14 years. The radiosensitivity of a cell line derived from human oral malignant melanoma was greater than that in cell lines derived from human cutaneous melanoma and with radiation, the number of melanosomes increased. There are very few clinical cases of oral malignant melanoma and very few cell lines derived from oral malignant melanoma, and so findings in these patients and these cell lines should be accumulated in order to clarify the biological behavior of oral malignant melanoma.",

        "abstract": "The ultrastructural features of calcification in a case of calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC) were studied. Scanning electron microscopic examination of the inner parts of the cyst wall revealed many short microvilli, and X-ray microanalysis of the high-density masses in the intercellular parts showed prominent calcium peaks, which meant that these masses were calcified materials. On transmission electron microscopic observations, many calcifications exhibited a distinctive ring formation around the periphery of a central core that consisted of an amorphous structure. These calcifications were observed with necrotic remnants of nuclear material and many identifiable mitochondria, thin fibers, and epithelial cells. The cytoplasm of ghost cells consisted of numerous short electron-dense tonofilament bundles. Needle-like structures were shown in the tonofilament bundles. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the needle-like crystals were hydroxyapatite. It is suggested that calcification in a COC may be related to degenerative mitochondria and tonofilament bundles of ghost cells.",

Differential scanning calorimetry, three-point bending tests and fastening tests were carried out to investigate basic properties of the wires. Transformation temperatures of the Ni-Ti alloy wires were in the range suitable for exhibiting super-elasticity at body temperature. The Ni-Ti alloy wires possessed enough bending flexibility to be used in the continuous wiring method and showed great recoverable displacement in the fastening test. With use of these properties, easy removal in an emergency and uniform fixation can be attained.",

In addition, we reviewed 140 cases reported in the Japanese literature since the last major review in 1974. The results of our study revealed that the clinical course of malignant melanoma in the oral region is worse than oral squamous cell carcinoma and that treatment by radiotherapy is effective in prolonging the life of these patients. Clinically, the tumors were classified into five types: (1) pigmented nodular type; (2) nonpigmented nodular type; (3) pigmented macular type; (4) pigmented mixed type; and (5) nonpigmented mixed type. We suggest that oral malignant melanoma might be different from cutaneous malignant melanoma and that new criteria for diagnosis and therapy for oral disease should be considered.",

Our results demonstrated that the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region, encompassing the src homology region 2 (SH2)-like subdomain, of the gamma chain is essential for association and activation of JAK3. Furthermore, IL-2-induced activation of JAK3 paralleled induction of the c-myc gene and DNA synthesis but not induction of the c-fos and c-jun genes. These results support the hypothesis that JAK3 plays a pivotal role in the IL-2 receptor-mediated signals for cell growth.",

In the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, viral entry is reported to require a low pH in intracytoplasmic vesicles; however, little is known about how SARS-CoV invades such compartments. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV mainly utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway for its entry to target cells by using infectious SARS-CoV, as well as a SARS-CoV pseudovirus packaged in the SARS-CoV envelope. The SARS-CoV entered caveolin-1-negative HepG2 cells, and the entry was significantly inhibited by treatment with chlorpromazine, an inhibitor for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and by small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing for the clathrin heavy chain. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV entered COS7 cells transfected with the mutant of ACE2 with the cytoplasmic tail deleted, SARS-CoV receptor, as well as the wild-type ACE2, and their entries were significantly inhibited by treatment with chlorpromazine. In addition, ACE2 translocated into EEA1-positive early endosomes immediately after the virus attachment to ACE2. These results suggest that when SARS-CoV binds ACE2 it is internalized and penetrates early endosomes in a clathrin-dependent manner and that the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 is not required for the penetration of SARS-CoV.",

        "abstract": "X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1, X-SCID) is a life-threatening disease caused by a mutated common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) gene. Although ex vivo gene therapy, i.e., transduction of the gammac gene into autologous CD34(+) cells, has been successful for treating SCID-X1, the retrovirus vector-mediated transfer allowed dysregulated integration, causing leukemias. Here, to explore an alternative gene transfer methodology that may offer less risk of insertional mutagenesis, we employed the phiC31 integrase-based integration system using human T-cell lines, including the gammac-deficient ED40515(-).A phiC31 integrase and a neo(r) gene expression plasmid containing the phiC31 attB sequence were co-delivered by electroporation into Jurkat cells. After G418 selection, integration site analyses were performed using linear amplification mediated-polymerase chain reaction (LAM-PCR). ED40515(-) cells were also transfected with a gammac expression plasmid containing attB, and the integration sites were determined. IL-2 stimulation was used to assess the functionality of the transduced gammac in an ED40515(-)-derived clone.Following co-introduction of the phiC31 integrase expression plasmid and the plasmid carrying attB, the efficiency of integration into the unmodified human genome was assessed. Several integration sites were characterized, including new integration sites in intergenic regions on chromosomes 13 and 18 that may be preferred in hematopoietic cells. An ED40515(-) line bearing the integrated gammac gene exhibited stable expression of the gammac protein, with normal IL-2 signaling, as assessed by STAT5 activation.This study supports the possible future use of this phiC31 integrase-mediated genomic integration strategy as an alternative gene therapy approach for treating SCID-X1.",

        "abstract": "Abnormally high signals from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are associated with carcinogenesis, and impaired deactivation of RTKs may also be a mechanism in cancer. Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) is one of the master regulators that sort activated receptors toward lysosomes and shut down their signals. Hrs contains a ubiquitin-interacting motif and is involved in the endosomal sorting of monoubiquitinated membrane proteins, such as growth factor receptor and E-cadherin. Here, we investigated the role of Hrs in determining the malignancy of cancer cells and discovered that the targeted disruption of Hrs by small interfering RNA effectively attenuated the proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenesis, and metastatic potential of HeLa cells in vitro and in vivo. The restoration of Hrs expression increased cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in a mouse embryonic fibroblast line established from a Hrs knockout mouse. Further analysis revealed that Hrs depletion was associated with the up-regulation of E-cadherin and reduced beta-catenin signaling. The aberrant accumulation of E-cadherin most likely resulted from impaired E-cadherin degradation in lysosomes. These results suggest that Hrs may play a critical role in determining the malignancy of cancer cells by regulating the degradation of E-cadherin.",

Here, we investigated MLV vector integration sites in human T-cells, since they are amenable to gene transfer studies, and have been used therapeutically in clinical trials. We mapped 340 MLV vector integration sites in the infected human T-cell clones we established. The data showed that MLV preferred integration near the transcription start sites (+/-5kb), near CpG islands (+/-1kb), and within the first intron of RefSeq genes. We also identified MLV integration hot spots that contained three or more integrations within a 100kb region. RT-PCR revealed that mRNA-levels of T-cell clones that contained MLV integrations near transcription start sites or introns were dysregulated compared to the uninfected cells. These studies help define the profile of MLV integration in T-cells and the risks associated with MLV-based gene therapy.",

        "abstract": "The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins form multimolecular complexes that control multivesicular body formation, endosomal sorting, and transport ubiquitinated membrane proteins (including cell-surface receptors) to the endosomes for degradation. There is accumulating evidence that endosomal dysfunction is linked to neural cell degeneration in vitro, but little is known about the relationship between neural disorders and ESCRT proteins in vivo. Here we specifically deleted the hrs gene, ESCRT-0, in the neurons of mice by crossing loxP-flanked hrs mice with transgenic mice expressing the synapsin-I Cre protein (SynI-cre). Histological analyses revealed that both apoptosis and a loss of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons occurred in the hrs(flox/flox);SynI-cre mice. Notably, the hrs(flox/flox);SynI-cre mice accumulated ubiquitinated proteins, such as glutamate receptors and an autophagy-regulating protein, p62. These molecules are particularly prominent in the hippocampal CA3 neurons and cerebral cortex with advancing age. Accordingly, we found that both locomotor activity and learning ability were severely reduced in the hrs(flox/flox);SynI-cre mice. These data suggest that Hrs plays an important role in neural cell survival in vivo and provide an animal model for neurodegenerative diseases that are known to be commonly affected by the generation of proteinaceous aggregates.",

IL-21 binds with its cognate receptor complex, which consists of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common gamma chain (gammac) receptor subunit. We identified novel IL-21R-binding molecule, WD-40 repeats containing SOCS-box-2, WSB-2. WSB-2 associated with the membrane-proximal intracytoplasmic region of IL-21R, including box1 and box2. Overexpression study of WSB-2 showed the reduction of IL-21R expression and IL-21-induced signal transduction. On the other hand, small interfering RNA for WSB-2 enhanced the expression level of IL-21R and IL-21-induced STAT3 activation, indicating that WSB-2 negatively controls the receptor expression. This report provides the first evidence that WSB-2 is a regulator of IL-21R expression and IL-21-induced signal transduction.",

In this report, we demonstrate the functional significance of STAM in cytokine-mediated signal transduction. STAM is associated with Jak3 and Jak2 tyrosine kinases via its ITAM region and phosphorylated by Jak3 and Jak2 upon stimulation with IL-2 and GM-CSF, respectively. An SH3 deletion mutant of STAM confers a dominant-negative effect on DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. Furthermore, the wild-type STAM, but not STAM mutants deleted of SH3 and ITAM, significantly enhances c-myc induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. These results strongly implicate STAM in the signaling pathways for cell growth and c-myc induction immediately downstream of the Jaks associated with the cytokine receptors.",

To examine the relative roles of these protein kinases in the mechanism of p38 MAP kinase activation in vivo, we examined the effect of disruption of the murine Mkk3, Mkk4, and Mkk6 genes on the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. We show that MKK3 and MKK6are essential for tumor necrosis factor-stimulated p38 MAPK activation. In contrast, ultraviolet radiation-stimulated p38 MAPK activation was mediated by MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6. Loss of p38 MAPK activation in the mutant cells was associated with defects in growth arrest and increased tumorigenesis. These data indicate that p38 MAPK is regulated by the coordinated and selective actions of three different protein kinases in response to cytokines and exposure to environmental stress.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin 2 (IL-2), a T cell-derived cytokine, targets a variety of cells to induce their growth, differentiation, and functional activation. IL-2 inserts signals into the cells through IL-2 receptors expressed on cell surfaces to induce such actions. In humans, the functional IL-2 receptor consists of the subunit complexes of the alpha, beta and gamma chains, or the beta and gamma chains. The third component, the gamma chain, of IL-2 receptor plays a pivotal role in formation of the full-fledged IL-2 receptor, together with the beta chain, the gamma chain participates in increasing the IL-2 binding affinity and intracellular signal transduction. Moreover, the cytokine receptors for at least IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 utilize the same gamma chain as an essential subunit. Interestingly, mutations of the gamma chain gene cause human X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) characterized by a complete or profound T cell defect. Among the cytokines sharing the gamma chain, at least IL-7 is essentially involved in early T cell development in the mouse organ culture system. The molecular identification of the gamma chain brought a grasp of the structures and functions of the cytokine receptor and an in-depth understanding of the cause of human XSCID. To investigate the mechanism of XSCID and development of gene therapy for XSCID, knockout mice for the gamma chain gene were produced that showed similar but not exactly the same phenotypes as human XSCID.",

        "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved system responsible for the degradation of cellular components and contributes to the increasing of amino acid pool, organelle turnover, and elimination of intracellular bacteria. The molecular process of autophagy is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that Hrs, a master regulator in endosomal protein sorting, plays critical roles for the autophagic degradation of non-specific proteins and Streptococcus pyogenes. We found that Hrs containing FYVE domain is localized to autophagosomes. Hrs depletion resulted in a significant decrease in the number of mature autophagosomes (autophagolysosomes) detected by the co-localization of autophagosome marker LC3 and lysosome marker LAMP-1. In contrast, formation of the primary autophagosome, detected by LC3 immunoblotting and lysosomal degradation of non-specific proteins, were not significantly altered by Hrs depletion. Based on these results, we propose a novel function of Hrs, as a crucial player in the maturation of autophagosomes.",

        "abstract": "We examined the biological function of a nonstructural regulatory protein, NS1, of human parvovirus B19. Because of the cytotoxic activity of NS1, human hematopoietic cell lines, K562, Raji, and THP-1, were established as transfectants which produce the viral NS1 protein upon induction by using bacterial lactose repressor/operator system. NS1 was significantly produced in the three transfectant cells in an inducer dose- and time-dependent manner. Surprisingly, these three transfectants secreted an inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in response to induction. However, no production of other related cytokines, IL-1beta, IL-8, or tumor necrosis factor alpha, was seen. Moreover, NS1-primed IL-6 induction was transiently demonstrated in primary human endothelial cells. Analysis with luciferase reporter plasmids carrying IL-6 promoter mutant fragments demonstrated that NS1 effect is mediated by a NF-kappaB binding site in the IL-6 promoter region, strongly implying that NS1 functions as a trans-acting transcriptional activator on the IL-6 promoter. Our novel finding, IL-6 induction by NS1, supports the possible relationship between parvovirus B19 infection and polyclonal activation of B cells in rheumatoid arthritis and indicates that NS1 protein may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of some B19-associated diseases by modulating the expression of host cellular genes.",

Being sorted to the MVB generally results in the lysosome-dependent degradation of cell-surface receptors, and defects in this machinery induce dysregulated receptor traffic and turnover. Recent lessons from gene targeting and silencing methodologies have implicated the ESCRT in normal development, cell differentiation, and growth, as well as in the budding of certain enveloped viruses. Furthermore, it is becoming apparent that the dysregulation of ESCRT proteins is involved in the development of various human diseases, including many types of cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we summarize the roles of ESCRT proteins in MVB sorting processes and the regulation of tumor cells, and we discuss some of their other functions that are unrelated to vesicular transport.",

They are activated by stimulation with IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, or IL-15, receptors of which share the gamma chain of the IL-2R. We have obtained direct evidence of Jak1 association with the alpha chains of receptors for IL-4, IL-7 and IL-9 and with the beta chain of IL-2R, which is also common to the IL-15R. Furthermore, we have prepared mutant IL-2R beta chains with a mutation in the box 1 region, which is conserved among the IL-2R beta chain and the alpha chains of the other cytokine receptors sharing the IL-2R gamma chain. Using MOLT-4 transfectants with the mutant beta chains, we found that two conserved proline residues within the box 1 region are essentially involved in association with Jak1. The MOLT-4 transfectants with the mutant beta chains lacking Jak1 association showed IL-2 responsiveness, in terms of activation of Jak3 and Stat5 and induction of cell growth, indicating that Jak1 is dispensable for IL-2-mediated cell growth signaling and that Jak1 activation is not required for activation of Jak3 and Stat5 in the MOLT-4 transfectants.",

        "abstract": "Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) but not HTLV-2 is associated with adult T-cell leukemia. We found that HTLV-2 Tax2 protein stimulated reporter gene expression regulated by the interleukin (IL)-2 promoter through the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in a human T-cell line (Jurkat). However, the activity of HTLV-1 Tax1 was minimal in this system. T-cell lines immortalized by HTLV-2 but not HTLV-1 constitutively exhibited activated NFAT in the nucleus and constitutively expressed IL-2 mRNA. Cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of NFAT activation, abrogated the induction of IL-2 mRNA in HTLV-2-immortalized T-cell lines and concomitantly inhibited cell growth. This growth inhibition was rescued by the addition of IL-2 to the culture. Furthermore, anti-IL-2 receptor antibodies significantly reduced the proliferation of HTLV-2-infected T-cell lines but not that of HTLV-1-infected cells. Our results suggest that Tax2 activates an IL-2 autocrine loop mediated through NFAT that supports the growth of HTLV-2-infected cells under low-IL-2 conditions. This mechanism would be especially important in vivo, where this autocrine mechanism establishes a nonleukemogenic life-long HTLV-2 infection. The results also suggest that differences in long-term cytokine production between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection are another factor for the differences in pathogenesis.",

The components of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) pathway are critical for the formation of MVBs, however the relationship between the ESCRT pathway and the secretion of exosomes remains unclear. We here demonstrate that Hrs, an ESCRT-0 protein, is required for fascilitating the secretion of exosomes in dendritic cells (DCs). Ultrastructural analyses showed typical saucer-shaped exosomes in the culture supernatant from both the control and Hrs-depleted DCs. However, the amount of exosome secretion was significantly decreased in Hrs-depleted DCs following stimulations with ovalbumin (OVA) as well as calcium ionophore. Antigen-presentation activity was also suppressed in exsosomes purified from Hrs-depleted DCs, while no alteration in OVA degradation was seen in Hrs-depleted DCs. These data indicated that Hrs is involved in the regulation of antigen-presentation activity through the exosome secretion.",

Expression of Grf40 is predominant in hematopoietic cells, particularly T cells. Grf40 binds to the SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76) via its SH3 domain more tightly than Grb2. Incidentally, Grf40 binds to linker for activation of T cells (LAT) possibly via its SH2 domain. Overexpression of wild-type Grf40 in Jurkat cells induced a significant increase of SLP-76-dependent interleukin (IL)-2 promoter and nuclear factor of activated T cell (NF-AT) activation upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, whereas the COOH-terminal SH3-deleted Grf40 mutant lacked any recognizable increase in IL-2 promoter activity. Furthermore, the SH2-deleted Grf40 mutant led to a marked inhibition of these regulatory activities, the effect of which is apparently stronger than that of the SH2-deleted Grb2 mutant. Our data suggest that Grf40 is an adaptor molecule involved in TCR-mediated signaling through a more efficient interaction than Grb2 with SLP-76 and LAT.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine, functions in cells through its interaction with its receptor complex, which consists of two ligand-binding alpha subunits and two signal-transducing subunits known as gp130. There is a wealth of studies on signals mediated by gp130, but its downregulation is less well understood. Here we found that IL-6 stimulation induced lysosome-dependent degradation of gp130, which correlated with an increase in the K63-linked polyubiquitination of gp130. The stimulation-dependent ubiquitination of gp130 was mediated by c-Cbl, an E3 ligase, which was recruited to gp130 in a tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP2-dependent manner. We also found that IL-6 induced a rapid translocation of gp130 from the cell surface to endosomal compartments. Furthermore, the vesicular sorting molecule Hrs contributed to the lysosomal degradation of gp130 by directly recognizing its ubiquitinated form. Deficiency of either Hrs or c-Cbl suppressed gp130 degradation, which leads to a prolonged and amplified IL-6 signal. Thus, our present report provides the first evidence for involvement of a c-Cbl/SHP2 complex in ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of gp130 upon IL-6 stimulation. The lysosomal degradation of gp130 is critical for cessation of IL-6-mediated signaling.",

Ubiquitinated cargo is targeted to endosomes and digested by lysosomal enzymes. We previously identified AMSH, a deubiquitination enzyme (DUB), to be involved in vesicular transport. Here, we purified an AMSH-binding protein, CHMP3, which is an ESCRT-III subunit. ESCRT-III functions on maturing endosomes, indicating AMSH might also play a role in MVB/late endosomes. Expression of an AMSH mutant lacking CHMP3-binding ability resulted in aberrant endosomes with accumulations of ubiquitinated cargo. Nevertheless, CHMP3-binding capability was not essential for AMSH's in vitro DUB activity or its endosomal localization, suggesting that, in vivo, the deubiquitination of endosomal cargo is CHMP3-dependent. Ubiquitinated cargo also accumulated on endosomes when catalytically inactive AMSH was expressed or AMSH was depleted. These results suggest that both the DUB activity of AMSH and its CHMP3-binding ability are required to clear ubiquitinated cargo from endosomes.",

        "abstract": "Infection of erythroid-lineage cells by human parvovirus B19 is characterized by a gradual cytocidal effect. Accumulating evidence now implicates the nonstructural (NS1) protein of the virus in cytotoxicity, but the mechanism underlying the NS1-induced cell death is not known. Using a stringent regulatory system, we demonstrate that NS1 cytotoxicity is closely related to apoptosis, as evidenced by cell morphology, genomic DNA fragmentation, and cell cycle analysis with the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and the erythropoietin-dependent megakaryocytic cell line UT-7/Epo. Apoptosis was significantly inhibited by an interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-converting enzyme (ICE)/CED-3 family protease inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO (CPP32; caspase 3), whereas a similar inhibitor of ICE (caspase 1), Ac-YVAD-CHO, had no effect. Furthermore, stable expression of the human Bcl-2 proto-oncogene resulted in near-total protection from cell death in response to NS1 induction. Mutations engineered into the nucleoside triphosphate-binding domain of NS1 significantly rescued cells from NS1-induced apoptosis without having any effect on NS1-induced activation of the IL-6 gene expression which is mediated by NF-kappaB. Furthermore, using pentoxifylline, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation, we demonstrate that the NF-kappaB-mediated IL-6 activation by NS1 is uncoupled from the apoptotic pathway. This functional dissection indicates a complexity underlying the biochemical function of human parvovirus NS1 in transcriptional activation and induction of apoptosis. Our findings indicate that NS1 of parvovirus B19 induces cell death by apoptosis in at least erythroid-lineage cells by a pathway that involves caspase 3, whose activation may be a key event during NS1-induced cell death.",

        "abstract": "The Keap1-Nrf2 system plays a pivotal role in the oxidative stress response by inducing a number of cytoprotective genes. Under stress, damaged epithelial cells release cytokines that activate type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), which mediate the allergic immune response. In this article, we investigated the role of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in ILC2 homeostasis and allergic inflammation using Nrf2 knockout mice. ILC2s from Nrf2-deficient mice showed a transient, upregulated IL-33 response and underwent hyperproliferation in response to a combined stimulation of IL-33 with IL-2, IL-7, or TSLP. This enhanced proliferation was correlated with an increased activation of downstream signals, including JAK1, Akt, and Erk1/2. In contrast, activating Nrf2 with a chemical inducer (CDDO-Im) decreased the viability of the wild-type but not of the Nrf2-deficient ILC2s. This effect on viability resembled that exerted by the corticosteroid dexamethasone; however, unlike the latter, the Nrf2-dependent cell death was mediated by neither caspase 3-dependent apoptosis nor necroptosis. Using a mouse intratracheal IL-33 administration allergy model, we found that the activation of Nrf2 by CDDO-Im in vivo decreased the number of pulmonary ILC2s and eosinophils. These findings indicated that Nrf2 is an important regulator of the allergic response by determining the survival and death of ILC2s, and these findings suggest that Nrf2 activation is a potential therapeutic strategy for steroid-resistant allergy alleviation.",

IL-21 binds with its cognate receptor complex, which consists of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common gamma chain. We identified a novel IL-21R-binding molecule, WSB-1, which contains WD-40 repeats and a SOCS-box domain. WSB-1 associates with the middle part of intracytoplasmic region of IL-21R and enhances the maturation of IL-21R from N-linked glycosylated form to fully glycosylated mature form. Furthermore, WSB-1 moderates IL-21R degradation. Taken together, our present study suggests that WSB-1 has a role in the tuning of the maturation and degradation of IL-21R.",

In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism of IL-2-induced growth suppression with two HTLV-I-infected T cell lines; TL-OmI expressing endogenously three subunits, i.e. a, b and g chains, of the IL-2 receptor, and an MT-1 transfectant expressing the endogenous a and g chains and exogenous b chain. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 induced apoptosis in both T cell lines. Experiments with inhibitors for the proteases responsible for apoptosis signals showed that caspase 1 (IL-1b-converting enzyme) was not involved in apoptosis induced by IL-2. Other MT-1 sublines introduced with mutant b chains demonstrated that IL-2-induced apoptosis required signals from both the serine-rich (S) region and acidic (A) region of the IL-2 receptor b chain, which are essential but not critical for IL-2-mediated cell growth respectively. Collectively, IL- 2 functions not only on growth promotion and prevention of apoptosis but also on induction of apoptosis, which may be implicated in physiological regulation of immune reactions by controlling growth and activation of T cells.",

Here, we provide the first evidence that mitochondrial autophagy is specifically found in the B19-infected cells. The protein expression ratio for LC3-II/LC3-I increased significantly in infected cells, indicating possible involvement of cellular autophagy in the infection process. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analyses revealed that B19 infection induced an intracellular autophagosome as judged by endogenous LC3 staining. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA significantly facilitated B19-infection-mediated cell death. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which B19-infected cells survive by cellular autophagy.",

To offset the side effect, we have incorporated a suicide gene into therapeutic retroviral vector for selective elimination of transduced cells. In this study, B-cell lines from two X-SCID patients were transduced with bicistronic retroviral vector carrying human gamma c chain cDNA and Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. After confirmation of functional reconstitution of the gamma c chain, the cells were treated with ganciclovir (GCV). The gamma c chain positive cells were eliminated under low concentration without cytotoxicity on untransduced cells and have not reappeared at least for 5 months. Furthermore, the gamma c chain transduced cells were still sensitive to GCV after five months. These results demonstrated the efficacy of the suicide gene therapy although further in vivo studies are required to assess feasibility of this approach in clinical trial.",

AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) is a deubiquitination enzyme that participates in the endosomal sorting of several cell-surface molecules. AMSH impairment results in missorted ubiquitinated cargoes in vitro and severe neurodegeneration in vivo, but it is not known how AMSH deficiency causes neuronal damage in the brain. Here, we demonstrate that AMSH(-/-) mice developed ubiquitinated protein accumulations as early as embryonic day 10 (E10), and that severe deposits were present in the brain at postnatal day 8 (P8) and P18. Interestingly, TDP-43 was found to accumulate and colocalize with glial marker-positive cells in the brain. Glutamate receptor and p62 accumulations were also found; these molecules colocalized with ubiquitinated aggregates in the brain. These data suggest that AMSH plays an important role in degrading ubiquitinated proteins and glutamate receptors in vivo. AMSH(-/-) mice provide an animal model for neurodegenerative diseases, which are commonly characterized by the generation of proteinaceous aggregates.",

        "abstract": "The transplantation of human cancer cells into immunodeficient NOD/SCID/IL-2R\u03b3c(null) (NOG) mice often causes highly malignant cell populations like cancer stem cells to emerge. Here, by serial transplantation in NOG mice, we established two highly tumorigenic adult T-cell leukemia-derived cell lines, ST1-N6 and TL-Om1-N8. When transplanted s.c., these cells formed tumors significantly earlier and from fewer initial cells than their parental lines ST1 and TL-Om1. We found that protein kinase B (AKT) signaling was upregulated in ST1-N6 and TL-Om1-N8 cells, and that this upregulation was due to the decreased expression of a negative regulator, INPP5D. Furthermore, the introduction of a constitutively active AKT mutant expression vector into ST1 cells augmented the tumorigenicity of the cells, whereas treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 attenuated the progression of tumors induced by ST1-N6 cells. Collectively, our results reveal that the AKT signaling pathway plays a critical role in the malignancy of adult T-cell leukemia-derived cells. ",

We evaluated SEMA3E and PLXND1 expression by quantitative RT-PCR in gastric tissues from 62\u00a0patients who underwent gastrectomy and analyzed the correlation between their expression and clinicopathological variables. To assess the function of SEMA3E, we generated human gastric cancer cell lines with suppressed or increased SEMA3E expression. The expression level of SEMA3E, but not PLXND1, was correlated with lymph node involvement and metastatic progression in gastric cancer. A significant association was observed between a high level of SEMA3E expression and poor differentiation or poor survival in the intestinal type of gastric cancer. SEMA3E knockdown in gastric cancer cells attenuated cell proliferation and metastatic ability in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, SEMA3E caused cell proliferation and anchorage-independent cell growth in the intestinal type of gastric cancer. These results suggested that SEMA3E is likely to be involved in the development of gastric cancer and might also be a therapeutic target for its treatment. ",

        "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) is a membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase that regulates cellular pH, is upregulated in various solid tumors, and is considered to be a therapeutic target. Here, we describe the essential role of CA9 in the tumorigenicity of cells derived from human adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). We previously established the highly tumorigenic ST1-N6 subline from the ATL-derived ST1 cell line by serial xenotransplantation in NOG mice. In the present study, we first show that CA9 expression is strongly enhanced in ST1-N6 cells. We then sorted ST1 cells by high or low CA9 expression and established ST1-CA9 and ST1-CA9 sublines. ST1-CA9 cells, like ST1-N6 cells, were more strongly tumorigenic than ST1-CA9 or parental ST1 cells when injected into NOG mice. Knockdown of CA9 with shRNAs suppressed the ability of ST1-CA9 cells to initiate tumors, and the tumorigenicity of ST1 cells was significantly enhanced by introducing wild-type CA9 or a CA9 mutant with deletion of an intracytoplasmic domain. However, a CA9 with point mutations in the catalytic site did not increase the tumorigenicity of ST1 cells. Furthermore, we detected a small population of CA9 CD25 cells in lymph nodes of ATL patients. These findings suggest that CA9, and particularly its carbonic anhydrase activity, promotes the tumorigenicity of ATL-derived cells and may be involved in malignant development of lymphoma-type ATL.",

We found that the CD271+ but not CD271- cell population sorted from xenotransplanted HPCs possesses tumor-initiating capability in immunodeficient mice. Tumors generated from the CD271+ cells contained both CD271+ and CD271- cells, indicating that the population could undergo differentiation. Immunohistological analyses of the tumors revealed that the CD271+ cells localized to a perivascular niche near CD34+ vasculature, to invasive fronts, and to the basal layer. In accordance with these characteristics, a stemness marker, Nanog, and matrix metaloproteinases (MMPs), which are implicated in cancer invasion, were significantly up-regulated in the CD271+ compared to the CD271- cell population. Furthermore, using primary HPC specimens, we demonstrated that high CD271 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis for patients. Furthermore, RNA interference of CD271 in CD271+ cells decreased efficiency of tumor initiation and migration phenotypes, suggesting that CD271 is indeed functional. Taken together, our findings indicate that CD271 is a novel marker for cancer initiating cells and for HPC prognosis.Citation Format: Nobuyuki Tanaka, Takayuki Imai, Mai Mochizuki, Keiichi Tamai, Kazunori Yamaguchi, Kennichi Satoh, Kazuto Matsuura, Ikuro Sato, Shigeru Saijo, Kazuo Sugamura.

In the present study, an efficient  method was applied to recapitulate lung carcinogenesis using mouse LE cells. A Matrigel-assisted three-dimensional culture was used to isolate and selectively expand LE cells from mouse lungs. Purified LE cells were passaged and expanded for at least 2 to 3 months while maintaining epidermal growth factor-dependence. LE cells were also easily transformed by genetic manipulations using retroviral vectors. A SV40 large-T antigen, suppressing p53 and pRB, plus an activated oncogene, such as Kras or EGFR, were required to transform LE cells. Transformed cells formed tumors resembling non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in allograft models and exhibited strong oncogene addiction. This experimental system provided a unique model system to study lung tumorigenesis and develop novel therapeutics against NSCLC.",

Instead of invasive biopsies, development of collecting biological data of the tumor from blood samples is expected. We conducted a prospective study to assess the feasibility of detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in plasma samples. Method. NSCLC patients harboring EGFR activating mutations, who were going to receive EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as first-line treatment, were enrolled in this study. Plasma EGFR activating mutations and the T790M resistance mutation were analyzed by an improved PNA-LNA PCR clamp method, characterized by a 10-fold or more sensitivity compared with the original methods. Result. Six patients with wild-type EGFR and 24 patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled in this study. Pretreatment plasma samples achieved sensitivity of 79%. The 6 patients with wild-type EGFR were all negative for plasma EGFR mutations. At the time of disease progression, plasma T790M mutation was detected in 8 of 16 cases. Absence of T790M before and during TKI treatment and disappearance of activating mutations during TKI treatment were considered as predictors of EGFR-TKIs efficacy. Conclusion. We were able to detect EGFR mutations in plasma samples by using an improved PNA-LNA PCR clamp method. ",

        "title": "Nrf2 suppresses macrophage inflammatory response by blocking proinflammatory cytokine transcription",
        "abstract": "Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) transcription factor regulates oxidative/xenobiotic stress response and also represses inflammation. However, the mechanisms how Nrf2 alleviates inflammation are still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Nrf2 interferes with lipopolysaccharide-induced transcriptional upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and ChIP-qPCR analyses revealed that Nrf2 binds to the proximity of these genes in macrophages and inhibits RNA Pol II recruitment. Further, we found that Nrf2-mediated inhibition is independent of the Nrf2-binding motif and reactive oxygen species level. Murine inflammatory models further demonstrated that Nrf2 interferes with IL6 induction and inflammatory phenotypes in vivo. Thus, contrary to the widely accepted view that Nrf2 suppresses inflammation through redox control, we demonstrate here that Nrf2 opposes transcriptional upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine genes. This study identifies Nrf2 as the upstream regulator of cytokine production and establishes a molecular basis for an Nrf2-mediated anti-inflammation approach. Controlling inflammation is critical in preventing various diseases, such as allergies, autoimmune diseases, cancer and metabolic syndromes1, 2. Transcription factor Nrf2, which is essential for protection against oxidative/xenobiotic stresses, has been known to attenuate inflammation3, 4. An Nrf2-deficiency causes an exacerbation of inflammation in a variety of murine models, such as sepsis, pleurisy and emphysema5, 6, 7, 8, and also causes autoimmune phenotypes in some murine strains9, 10. Consistently, Nrf2 activation in myeloid cells alleviates inflammation11. In human clinical studies, NRF2 inducer Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) has been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis12, 13, in part based on its anti-inflammatory function. These observations indicate that Nrf2 is essential for the control of inflammation. The regulatory system of Nrf2 activity has turned out as an attractive drug target due to its sophisticated mechanism14, 15. Under unstressed conditions, Nrf2 is constitutively degraded through binding to Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), an adapter protein of E3 ubiquitin ligase. In the presence of oxidative and xenobiotic stresses, Nrf2 degradation is stalled, leading to a rapid accumulation of Nrf2. Nrf2 then translocates into the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with one of the small Maf proteins. Nrf2 binds to the regulatory regions of target genes to upregulate their transcription. Notably, a number of small molecules have been found to disrupt the Keap1-mediated degradation of Nrf2 and cause Nrf2 accumulation, and some of these molecules are approved or being developed for Nrf2-inducing therapy. However, the mechanism underlying Nrf2-mediated anti-inflammation has not been clarified in detail. Since Nrf2 upregulates numerous antioxidant genes, elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been considered to be the molecular basis of Nrf2-mediated anti-inflammation. Indeed, recent reports suggest that elimination of ROS suppresses inflammation in Nrf2-deficient mice8, 16. On the other hand, Nrf2 regulates the expression of macrophage-specific genes that are not categorized as anti-oxidative stress-response genes. For example, genes encoding MARCO, a scavenger receptor required for bacteria phagocytosis17, and CD36, a receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein related to atherosclerosis, are targets of Nrf2 (ref. 18). These insights imply that Nrf2 may also act as an anti-inflammatory regulator in a ROS-independent manner. To address this issue, in this study we explored the Nrf2 target genes in the inflammatory state using proinflammatory (M1-) activated and anti-inflammatory (M2-) activated macrophages19. Microarray and Nrf2 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -seq analyses revealed that Nrf2 binds to the proximity of the proinflammatory cytokine genes, including IL6 and IL1b, and inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of these genes. This Nrf2-mediated transcriptional interference appears independent of ROS levels and independent of ARE (antioxidant responsive element). Notably, Nrf2 activation significantly disrupted the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to the IL6 and IL1b loci. In vivo imaging analysis further revealed that Nrf2 activation inhibits IL6 induction in murine inflammation model and alleviates inflammatory phenotypes. Thus, contrary to the current hypothesis that Nrf2 represses inflammation as a secondary consequence of anti-oxidation, these results unequivocally demonstrate that Nrf2 inhibits the induction of proinflammatory cytokine gene transcription. These findings indicate that Nrf2 is the key regulator for the two important cytoprotective pathways, anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. We first generated Nrf2-activated and Nrf2-depleted macrophages through conditional knockout of the Keap1 gene in myeloid cells (KpCKO) and general knockout of the Nrf2 gene (Nrf2-KO), respectively. The KpCKO mice were generated by crossing Keap1flox/flox mice and LysM-Cre mice20, 21. In KpCKO and Nrf2-KO mice, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were differentiated normally (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), and comparable amounts of BMDMs were harvested from both lines of mice (Supplementary Fig. 1c), indicating that Nrf2 activation or Nrf2-depletion does not affect the differentiation and maturation of BMDMs. The number of neutrophils was also comparable among these genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 1d). In KpCKO mouse-derived BMDMs, Nrf2 accumulated significantly (Fig. 1a). This accumulation of Nrf2 induced the expression of Nqo1 (NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1), a representative Nrf2 target gene. The extent of Nqo1 induction was similar in control BMDMs, LPS/interferon (IFN) \u03b3-treated M1-BMDMs, and IL-4-treated M2-BMDMs (Fig. 1b), indicating that accumulated Nrf2 functions equivalently in these BMDMs regardless of the polarization towards M1 and M2 macrophages. Microarray analyses revealed that the expression of 4,162 and 856 genes was upregulated by the M1 and M2 stimulation, respectively. Expression profiles of these genes showed a strong correlation between KpCKO and wild-type (WT) BMDMs (Fig. 1c), indicating that the genetic Nrf2 activation does not affect the polarization of macrophages. Surprisingly, upregulation of a subset of M1-induced genes (561 genes) was specifically inhibited in KpCKO BMDMs (Fig. 1d, blue bar). These genes included IL6, IL1b, IL1a, Nos2 and IL12b. The inhibition was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR analyses (Fig. 1e\u2013i). In contrast, expression levels of other M1-induced genes, such as Tnf and Irf1, and M2-induced genes, such as Arg1 and Ccl17, were not changed in KpCKO BMDMs (Fig. 1j\u2013m). These results indicate that Nrf2 inhibits the transcriptional induction of a subset of M1-induced genes. To examine whether Nrf2 directly binds to the M1-induced genes, we performed Nrf2 ChIP-seq analysis. In the M1-induced gene loci, Nrf2 binding was observed in the upstream regions of the IL6 and IL1b genes (Fig. 2a,b). Nrf2 binding was also detected in the downstream region of the IL1a gene (Fig. 2c), but this Nrf2-binding peak was far away from the IL1a gene TSS (transcription start site), so that the site may not be involved in the IL1a gene regulation. The expression of Ckap2l gene, located between the IL1a gene and the Nrf2 peak, was not changed upon both Nrf2 activation and M1 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Notably, Nrf2-binding peaks near the IL6 and IL1b genes were not observed in our previous Nrf2 ChIP-seq analysis with Hepa1 cells22 (Fig. 2a,b). This is in clear contrast to the Nrf2 binding near representative anti-oxidative Nrf2 target gene loci, Nqo1 (Fig. 2d) and Hmox1 (Supplementary Fig. 2b), in which Nrf2 binding was observed both in BMDMs and Hepa1 cells. In the Nrf2 peaks, ARE (TGAG/CnnnGC)23, 24 was enriched in their peak summits, consistent with the previous Nrf2 ChIP-seq study22 (Fig. 2e). When we examined phylogenetic conservation of ARE sequences, we found that the consensus motif is conserved among various mammalian genomes at the Nrf2 peak summit proximal to the IL6 gene (Fig. 2f). On the other hand, Nrf2-binding regions proximal to IL1b and IL1a genes did not contain conserved TGAG/CnnnGC motif at the peak summits. Therefore, we surmise that Nrf2 is recruited through the association with other proteins rather than direct binding to the TGAG/CnnnGC motif or ARE, at least at the IL1b and IL1a loci. The ARE localized in the proximity of IL6 gene has been reported to upregulate IL6 expression in hepatocytes25, suggesting that Nrf2 binds to the IL6 gene also in hepatic cells, but activates gene expression, in contrast to the repression in macrophages. Binding of Nrf2 was further confirmed by ChIP-qPCR analyses of BMDMs derived from KpCKO mice (Fig. 2g\u2013j). In the peak regions proximal to the IL6, IL1b, IL1a and Nqo1 genes, the Nrf2-binding signal was higher than the negative control loci, that is, Thromboxane synthase gene (Txs) intron and the non-peak regions proximal to the IL1b and IL1a genes (Fig. 2g\u2013j). Nrf2 binding to proinflammatory cytokine loci was observed in both untreated and M1-activated cells, although the most prominent was observed in M1-stimulated BMDMs at the IL6 and IL1a loci. We then conducted an association analysis of the microarray data and ChIP-seq data of M1-induced macrophage genes. The results indicate that of the 561 genes repressed by Nrf2, 203 genes had Nrf2-binding peaks in their proximal regions (Fig. 1d). We also conducted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis26 for these 203 genes and found that several important pathways were associated with these genes (Fig. 3a). The pathways related to the inflammatory diseases were enriched in these genes, supporting the notion that Nrf2 contributes to the resolution of inflammation. These 203 genes displayed expression profiles distinct from those of typical Nrf2 target genes, as the Nrf2 activation in KpCKO mice strongly repressed the expression of these 203 genes. Importantly, 132 out of these 203 Nrf2-repressed genes harboured macrophage-specific Nrf2-binding peaks in their proximal regions, as was the cases for the IL6, IL1b and IL1a genes (Fig. 3b). In contrast, some of the 203 genes retained Nrf2-binding peaks both in M1-macrophage and Hepa1 cells (Fig. 3b, blue dots). Collectively, these results imply that Nrf2 directly inhibits the M1-induced expression of various inflammation-related genes through binding to their proximal regulatory regions. To ascertain Nrf2 dependency of the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine gene induction, we tested the consequences of chemical induction of Nrf2. For the pharmacological activation of Nrf2, we used two small molecule inducers: diethylmaleate (DEM), an electrophilic reagent, and 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), an endogenous electrophilic lipid that is naturally generated in macrophages5. These inducers accumulated Nrf2 (Fig. 4a) and significantly upregulated the Nqo1 expression in an Nrf2-dependent manner (Fig. 4b). Showing a stark contrast, treatment with the inducers markedly inhibited the transcriptional induction of IL6, IL1b and IL1a in M1-induced macrophages (Fig. 4c\u2013e), as was the case for the genetic activation of Nrf2 in KpCKO. The inhibition was cancelled in Nrf2-KO BMDMs (Fig. 4c\u2013e), indicating direct contribution of Nrf2. DEM inhibited the IL6, IL1b and IL1a gene expression dose-dependently (Fig. 4f\u2013h). We then examined Nrf2 binding to the proximity of the IL6, IL1b and IL1a genes upon DEM treatment. The ChIP-qPCR results clearly indicated that Nrf2 binds to the proximity of these inflammatory cytokine genes (Fig. 4i\u2013k) and also to the Nqo1 gene (Fig. 4l) in the DEM-treated BMDMs, even without LPS treatment. Notably, the DEM treatment significantly inhibited the LPS-induced and LPS/alum-induced secretion of IL-6 (Fig. 4m) and IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 4n) into the culture media, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that Nrf2 binds to the regulatory regions of these inflammatory cytokine genes and reduces these cytokine productions. We then examined whether this negative regulation of the inflammatory cytokine genes by Nrf2 is also operative in human macrophage-related cells. To this end, we exploited human monocytic THP-1 cells27. Showing very good agreement with the results in mice, NRF2 activation by DEM inhibited the LPS-induced transcriptions of the IL6, IL1B and IL1A genes, but activated the NQO1 gene expression in the THP-1 cells (Fig. 4o\u2013r). These results indicate that the Nrf2-mediated inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine gene induction is conserved in human monocytic cells. Thus, consistent with the results of the genetic analyses, the pharmacological induction of Nrf2 also markedly inhibited the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes both in murine and human cells. Since Nrf2 regulates expression of numerous genes that participate in the control of ROS, we examined whether the Nrf2-mediated inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine gene induction depends on the ROS levels. For this purpose, we treated BMDMs with antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a precursor of glutathione. LPS treatment significantly upregulated the ROS levels, while both of DEM- and NAC-treatment reduced ROS to the basal level (Fig. 5a). However, the NAC-treatment did not affect the LPS-induced transcription of the IL6, IL1b and IL1a genes (Fig. 5b\u2013d), strongly supporting our contention that decrease of the ROS level does not provoke the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine genes. To gain further insights into the relation of anti-inflammation and activation of Nrf2, we next examined the temporal order of inhibition and activation of Nrf2 target genes. After the M1 stimulation, the expression of IL6, IL1b and IL1a mRNAs was quickly induced, as early as 3\u2009h after the stimulation (Fig. 5e\u2013g). Of note, simultaneous treatment with the Nrf2 inducer DEM almost completely suppressed the proinflammatory gene induction from the early time-points (Fig. 5e\u2013g). This immediate suppression occurred almost at the same timing as the DEM-mediated induction of the Nrf2 target genes, that is, Nqo1 (Fig. 5h), Hmox1 and Gclc (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). These results indicate that the transcriptional inhibition is a primary event provoked by Nrf2, rather than a secondary consequence of the elimination of ROS through the production of antioxidant enzymes and proteins. To clarify whether this Nrf2-mediated inhibition depends on the order of LPS treatment and Nrf2 activation by DEM, we changed the timing of the LPS and DEM additions. In an experiment shown in Supplementary Fig. 4a, macrophages were first treated with DEM for 3\u2009h and then treated with LPS for an additional 3\u2009h, while in an experiment shown in Supplementary Fig. 4b, the order was switched. The results clearly showed that DEM inhibited the proinflammatory cytokine gene expression regardless of the order of LPS and DEM treatment. In contrast to the widely accepted view that Nrf2 suppresses the inflammation through ROS elimination, our results thus far suggest that Nrf2 regulates the inflammation through transcriptional inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine IL6 and IL1b genes. To determine mechanisms how Nrf2 inhibits the induction of a subset of inflammatory cytokine genes, we examined changes that Nrf2 elicits in the transcription of these genes. We first conducted ChIP-qPCR analyses exploiting BMDMs and a Pol II-specific antibody to dissect the transcription initiation step. The results revealed that LPS-induced binding of Pol II to the proximity of TSSs of the IL6 and IL1b genes was significantly inhibited by concomitant DEM treatment (Fig. 6a,b), indicating that Nrf2 inhibits the transcriptional initiation of these proinflammatory cytokine genes through the interference with Pol II recruitment to the TSSs. Since expression of many cytokine genes are regulated at the post-transcriptional level28, we also examined stability of the cytokine mRNAs. However, the Nrf2 activation did not affect substantially the mRNA stability of IL6, IL1b and IL1a (Supplementary Fig. 5a). We also assessed pre-mRNA syntheses from the IL6, IL1b and IL1a genes and found that Nrf2 inhibited the pre-mRNA syntheses, and that the magnitudes of the inhibition were practically equivalent to those of the mature mRNA reduction (Supplementary Fig. 5b). These results thus indicate that Nrf2 regulates IL6 and IL1b gene expression at the transcription initiation step. It has been postulated that Pol II is recruited to the TSSs of inflammation-related genes through association with a group of inflammation-responding transcription factors19, and Nrf2 activation has been reported to inhibit NF-\u03baB signal11. In our survey of various ChIP-seq data, we found that transcription factors required for inflammation-induced expression of IL6 gene, p65 (NF-\u03baB) (ref. 29), C/EBP\u03b2 (ref. 30) and c-Jun (AP-1) (ref. 31), bind in close proximity of Nrf2-binding sites (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Therefore, we hypothesized that Nrf2 might inhibit the recruitment of these transcription factors. We tested this hypothesis by conducting ChIP-qPCR analyses exploiting BMDMs and p65-specific antibody and found that LPS markedly enhanced the recruitment of p65 to the proximity of the IL6 and IL1b genes. However, the recruitment of p65 was unchanged by the DEM treatment, indicating that NF-\u03baB was recruited normally to the IL6 and IL1b gene regulatory regions even under the Nrf2 activation (Fig. 6c). Similarly, recruitment of C/EBP\u03b2 was also unchanged upon the Nrf2 activation (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Furthermore, while LPS treatment provoked certain expected changes in the histone modifications, including decrease in tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and increase in H3K27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) and H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3), Nrf2 activation by DEM treatment did not change these modification substantially (Supplementary Fig. 6c\u2013e). We also found that Nrf2 normally associates with co-activator CBP (ref. 32) and the components of Mediator complex33, MED16 and MED24 (Supplementary Fig. 7) in the presence of DEM. These co-activator associations did not decrease, or rather increased, in the LPS-treated cells compared with LPS-untreated cells. Our results thus demonstrate that Nrf2 inhibits the transcription initiation and Pol II recruitment to the IL6 and IL1b TSSs without changing the recruitment of proinflammatory transcription factors. Changes in the co-activators and the histone modifications wait for further extensive and elaborate analyses. To further delineate the mechanisms how Nrf2 operates the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine gene induction, we next conducted a luciferase reporter assay using an ~1\u2009kb region upstream of the IL6 gene that includes ARE. In IL6-wt construct, upstream sequence of the IL6 gene was ligated to a luciferase expression vector, while in IL6-mARE construct, ARE motif in the region was mutated (Fig. 7a). Co-transfection of constitutive active form of NRF2 (NRF2T80R) in 293T cells moderately upregulated the luciferase reporter expression from IL6-wt, but not from IL6-mARE (Fig. 7b), indicating that Nrf2 functions as a transcriptional activator even at the IL6 locus. This result is consistent with the previous report using hepatoma cells25. In contrast, co-transfection of p65 markedly elevated the luciferase reporter expression, indicating that NF-\u03baB acts as the primary inducer of the IL6 gene. Importantly, NRF2T80R inhibited the reporter expression in a dose dependent manner and this inhibition was observed even in the absence of ARE (Fig. 7c). These results suggest that Nrf2 inhibits the IL6 gene expression by interfering with the p65-mediated transcriptional activation of the gene. Given that inflammation-responding transcription factors bind to the close proximity of Nrf2-binding region (Fig. 6a,c and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b), Nrf2 may interfere with the function of these transcription factors, such as p65, and/or co-factors required for inflammation-induced transcription. To ascertain the finding that ARE might not be required for the Nrf2-mediated inhibition of IL6 induction, we deleted the Nrf2-binding regions including the ARE in macrophage-derived Raw264.7 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 system (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). We analysed two clones, in which the centre region of ChIP Nrf2-binding peak including the ARE was deleted. As the proinflammatory transcription factor-binding sites are located in the close proximity of the ARE, there is a possibility that the deletion of this region may disrupt the recruitment of transcription factors required for induction of IL6 gene expression. Indeed this was the case and the deletion abolished the LPS-induced expression of IL6 gene (Fig. 7d). Thus, our aim to evaluate the ARE contribution to the Nrf2-mediated inhibition cannot be accomplished. In contrast, deletion of Nrf2-binding region proximal to the IL1b gene kept the LPS-induction, perhaps due to preservation of the binding sites of activating transcription factors (Fig. 7e). Importantly, the DEM-mediated induction of Nrf2 nicely inhibited the LPS-mediated upregulation of IL1b gene expression, and the deletion of Nrf2-binding region did not affect the Nrf2-mediated inhibition of the IL1b induction, indicating that Nrf2-binding region is not essential for the IL1b inhibition, as is the case for ARE in the IL6 upstream region. One plausible explanation for these observations is that Nrf2 may be recruited to the IL6 and IL1b gene regulatory regions through the association with other transcription factors or co-factors. Finally, we utilized the whole mount in vivo monitoring system with hIL6-luc reporter (WIM-6) to verify the Nrf2-mediated inhibition of IL6 gene induction in vivo (Fig. 8a). WIM-6 mice harbour firefly luciferase transgenes, which is homologously recombined to the human IL6 gene in a bacterial artificial chromosome vector34. Thus, WIM-6 mice emit luminescence under the IL6-inducing stimuli. In this study, we executed an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model known as a murine model of multiple sclerosis, because IL-6 has been shown to be responsible for EAE development35. After immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, WIM-6 mice on the C57BL/6 background exhibited intense IL6-luc luminescence in their brains and spinal cords due to autoimmunity against the myelin component (Fig. 8b, left). Time course of the increase in luminescence showed a maximum emission of luminescence after day 10 (Fig. 8c), simultaneously with an increase in the EAE score (Fig. 8d). In contrast, when we activated Nrf2 in WIM-6 mice through concomitant knockdown of Keap1 (Keap1-KD), the IL6-luc luminescence upon EAE induction was remarkably reduced (Fig. 8b, right) throughout the experimental period (Fig. 8c). The maximum IL6-luc luminescence in the observation period was lower in Keap1-KD::WIM-6 mice than in WT Keap1::WIM-6 mice, although a few Keap1-KD mice showed the increase of IL6-luc luminescence. The EAE clinical score was also reduced in Keap1-KD::WIM-6 mice (Fig. 8d). The maximum EAE score in the observation period was significantly reduced in Keap1-KD::WIM-6 mice compared with WT Keap1::WIM-6 mice (Fig. 8d, right). We also conducted similar analyses exploiting WIM-6 mice on the ICR/CD1 background, which were preferable for in vivo imaging due to their white fur coat, but they were low responders to EAE. Showing very good agreement with the results of C57BL/6 mice, Keap1-KD::WIM-6 mice on the ICR/CD1 background exhibited lower IL6-luc luminescence (Supplementary Fig. 9a\u2013c) and EAE score (Supplementary Fig. 9d,e) than WT Keap1::WIM-6 mice did. To further confirm the Nrf2-medited inhibition of IL6 gene induction in vivo, we utilized another inflammation model, that is, Staphylococcus aureus infection. Upon infection with S. aureus, WIM-6 mice with Nrf2 knockout showed much more intense IL6-luc luminescence on their back than the WIM-6 mice with normal Nrf2 expression showed (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b). This experiment was executed by using the WIM-6 mice on the ICR/CD1 background. These results clearly indicate that Nrf2 inhibits the IL6 expression and alleviates inflammatory symptoms in vivo. While contributions of Nrf2 to anti-inflammation have been recognized, molecular basis of the Nrf2 function has long been obscure. In this study, two important points have been clarified. First, we discovered that Nrf2 inhibits the LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes, including IL6 and IL1b, through the ROS-independent transcriptional inhibition. We believe that this finding will be a turning point in understanding the Nrf2 function related to inflammation, because we previously assumed that Nrf2 function was limited to oxidative stress control and that anti-inflammation was merely a consequence of ROS elimination. In contrast to this dogma, this study clearly unravels that Nrf2 is the key regulator of proinflammatory cytokine expression as well as intracellular ROS, as summarized in Fig. 8e. Second, while Nrf2 has been recognized as an activating transcription factor, our data clarify the presence of transcription-inhibiting function of Nrf2. The binding of Nrf2 in close proximity of the IL6 and IL1b genes implies that Nrf2 inhibits transcription through direct DNA binding. However, our analyses indicate that Nrf2-mediated inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine gene expression in M1 macrophages is ARE-independent. Furthermore, Nrf2 inhibits Pol II recruitment to the TSSs of the IL6 and IL1b genes without affecting the NF-\u03baB recruitment required for the expression of IL6 and IL1b genes. Although precise elucidation of the molecular basis how Nrf2 elicits the transcriptional inhibition is rather complicated and still needs to be elucidated, our present findings support the notion that the Nrf2 regulates negatively the target genes that encode inflammatory cytokines. Mechanisms how Nrf2 inhibits the transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes in M1 macrophages is intriguing. However, in contrast to the rich history of research on the transcriptional activation by Nrf2, the transcriptional inhibition by Nrf2 in proinflammatory macrophages is an emerging concept that are introduced in this study, so that elucidation of fine mechanisms for the Nrf2-mediated inhibition of transcription needs further studies. In this regard, it should be noted that results from luciferase reporter assay imply that whereas Nrf2 acts as a transcriptional activator at various loci, Nrf2 specifically inhibits the inflammation-induced transcription mediated by NF-\u03baB. Of note, our results suggest that Nrf2 interferes with the transcription-activating system optimized for inflammatory response. This notion coincides with the fact that Nrf2 binds to the IL6 and IL1b loci, but does not affect the binding of NF-\u03baB and C/EBP\u03b2 to the loci, in our ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR analyses. The binding machinery of Nrf2 to the IL6 and IL1b loci is an important part in the mechanism of Nrf2-mediated transcriptional inhibition. In contrast to the situation that Nrf2 directly binds to a number of detoxifying and antioxidant target genes through ARE and activates expression of these genes, IL6 gene appears to be regulated in an ARE-independent manner, and AREs near the IL1b gene are phylogenetically not conserved. In contrast, our results demonstrate that Nrf2 inhibits the NF-\u03baB-mediated transcription of these proinflammatory cytokine genes. Since the Nrf2-binding regions near the IL6 and IL1b genes correspond to the common binding regions of multiple proinflammatory transcription factors, such as p65, C/EBP\u03b2 and c-Jun, it seems likely that Nrf2 is recruited to this region through association with other factors. Although direct interaction of Nrf2 with these inflammatory transcription factors has not been reported, MafK, one of the obligatory partner molecules of Nrf2, is reported to associate with p65 (ref. 36). Consistent with the report, we observed that p65 resides in the Nrf2-based transcription factor complex in LPS-treated Raw264.7 cells (H.S. and H.M., unpublished observation). Our data further demonstrate that Nrf2 associates with co-activators, such as CBP and the component of Mediator complex, MED16 and MED24, even in the LPS-treated conditions32, 33. Thus, available lines of evidence suggest that in an inflammatory condition, Nrf2 is recruited to regulatory regions of proinflammatory cytokine genes in an ARE-independent manner and inhibits their transcription by interfering with the activity of proinflammatory transcription factors without losing CBP and mediators. Alternative possibility is that Nrf2 suppresses the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes indirectly by recruiting transcriptional repressors acting in trans to the transcription factor complex formed in the proximity of the inflammatory cytokine genes. We surmise that our current findings may account for the mechanisms in drug efficacy of the Nrf2 inducer Tecfidera, which is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis12, 13, because IL-6 and IL-1 are the key players in the development of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases. Loss-of-function model mice of IL-6 or IL-1 receptor are resistant to EAE, a murine model of multiple sclerosis35, 37. It has been demonstrated that Nrf2 activation by treatment with small molecule inducers, CDDO (2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid) derivatives and sulforaphane alleviates the EAE clinical score, while Nrf2-deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to EAE38, 39, 40. CDDO-treated EAE mice showed a significant reduction in Th1 and Th17 cytokines including IL-6 (ref. 38), implying that Nrf2 activation with small molecules alleviates EAE through the inhibition of IL6 gene expression. Our results strongly support the contention that the therapeutic effect of the Nrf2 inducer depends, at least in part, on the Nrf2-mediated inhibition of IL-6 and IL-1 induction. Of note, Nrf2-deficiency has been found to cause spontaneous autoimmune phenotypes in certain strains of mice9, 10, raising the possibility that Nrf2 inducers are applicable for the other autoimmune diseases. We surmise that some of the Nrf2 functions previously attributed to ROS elimination may depend on the repression of IL-6 and IL-1. One of the candidates for this is anti-tumour immunity. It has been shown that Nrf2 acts as a \u2018double-edged sword\u2019 in tumour development. Nrf2 inhibits carcinogenesis through ROS elimination and detoxification41. In contrast, Nrf2 stimulates tumour proliferation through anti-oxidation and metabolic reprogramming of the cells42. In this regard, we recently reported that Nrf2 supports anti-tumour immunity by reducing the ROS level in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), resulting in reduced tumour metastasis43, 44. Interestingly, a blockade of IL-6 secreted from MDSCs has been reported to support the anti-tumour immunity45. Thus, Nrf2 contributes to the anti-tumour immunity through dual pathways, the repression of IL-6/IL-1 and/or ROS elimination in MDSCs. Another candidate for the Nrf2 function downstream of the IL-6/IL-1 repression is diabetes prevention. We have reported that genetic Nrf2 activation by Keap1-knockdown suppress obesity-induced diabetes through the improvement of insulin secretion and insulin resistance, resulting in the prevention of hyperglycemia46. Of note, the blockade of an IL-1 signal with an IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra (Kineret) improves glycaemia and insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes47. Nrf2 activation provokes the alteration of diabetes-related gene expression, which includes anti-oxidation, energy consumption and glyconeogenesis46. It seems plausible that in addition to these genes, Nrf2-mediated inhibition of IL-6/IL-1 induction contributes to the prevention and improvement of diabetes. As IL-6/IL-1 signalling exacerbates a broad spectrum of diseases, an Nrf2 inducer could be beneficial in the treatment of these IL-6/IL-1-related diseases. Neutralizing antibodies and receptor antagonists for blocking IL-6/IL-1 signalling have been developed and approved, for instance, for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Efforts are underway to find new indications, such as diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease1, 2, 48. Whereas these antibody-based drugs need to be administered subcutaneously or intravenously, one of the advantages of the small molecule Nrf2 inducers is that they can be administered orally, lowering the burden on patients. Therefore, it should be noted that our present study has firmly established the concept that Nrf2 inducers retain the potential to act as alternative anti-inflammatory agents. Deletion of the floxed Keap1 gene in myeloid lineage cells was achieved by crossing Keap1 flox mice20 with heterozygous mice harbouring a Cre recombinase transgene under the regulation of the lysozyme M (LysM) locus21. WT, Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 (Nrf2-KO) (ref. 3) and Keap1flox/flox::LysM-Cre (KpCKO) mice were maintained in a C57BL6/J genetic background. WIM-6 (ref. 34), Nrf2-KO and Keap1-knockdown mice (Keap1flox/flox)49 were maintained in C57BL6/J and ICR background. Results were similar in both sexes. Mice were used for experiments at 8\u201315 weeks of age, with the exception of neutrophil count that was performed with mice <1 year old. All mice were treated according to the regulations of The Standards for Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan) and the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan. All animal experiments were executed with the approval of the Tohoku University Animal Care Committee. To obtain BMDMs, hemolyzed bone marrow cells from WT, Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 (Nrf2-KO) and Keap1flox/flox::LysM-Cre (KpCKO) mice were cultured for 7 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (fetal bovine serum), 20-ng\u2009ml\u22121 M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulation factor, PeproTech) and Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Life Technologies). At day 3, a half volume of fresh DMEM with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 20-ng\u2009ml\u22121 M-CSF was added. At day 7, BMDMs were depleted with M-CSF several hours before stimulation. Unless stated, data are presented as the mean\u00b1s.d. of three mice, and the significance was determined by Student\u2019s unpaired t-test. THP-1 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank, and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% (vol/vol) FBS. Data from THP-1 cells are presented as the mean\u00b1s.d. of three individual samplings, and the significance was determined by Student\u2019s unpaired t-test. Cells were left untreated (Con) or incubated with 5-ng\u2009ml\u22121 LPS and 10-ng\u2009ml\u22121 IFN\u03b3 (M1), 10-ng\u2009ml\u22121 IL-4 (M2), or 5-ng\u2009ml\u22121 LPS (LPS). LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 were from R&D Systems. For pharmacological Nrf2 activation, cells were treated with 100-\u03bcM diethylmaleate (DEM) or 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). These Nrf2 inducers were stored as the solutions dissolved in DMSO (vehicle). DEM was from Wako chemicals, and 15d-PGJ2 was from Sigma-Aldrich. For detection of ROS, BMDMs were treated with CellROX Deep red reagent (Thermo) during the last 30\u2009min of 4\u2009h stimulation with or without 5-ng\u2009ml\u22121 LPS concomitant treatment with 100-\u03bcM DEM or 1-mM NAC. CellROX signal was detected with flow cytometry analysis using FACS-Caliber (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (TOMY Digital Biology). For the evaluation of the mRNA stability, 5-\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to cell cultures pre-treated with LPS for 3\u2009h without removal of the LPS-containing media. Unless stated, cells were stimulated for 6\u2009h in microarray and qRT-PCR analyses, and for 4\u2009h in ChIP-seq, ChIP-qPCR and immunoblot analyses. Whole cells were lysed in a SDS-containing sampling buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis using Nrf2-specific antibody50 (clone 103, 1:200 dilution) and \u03b1-Tubulin-specific (Sigma-Aldrich; T9026, 1:5,000 dilution) antibodies. Immunoblot using \u03b1-Tubulin-specific antibody is used as a loading control. Images have been cropped for presentation. Full-size images are presented in Supplementary Fig. 11. Total RNA samples of BMDMs from two independent mice of each genotype were extracted using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) and used for the microarray analyses. The expression data were normalized using GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics), and analysed using an R/bioconductor (ver. 3.0.2, R Core Team (2014). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL http://www.R-project.org/). Pathway analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes26. Total RNA was isolated from cells using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with an ABI PRISM 7300 sequence detector system and StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems) using THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO). Data were normalized by the Gapdh mRNA level. Primer sequences are available on request. BMDMs were fixed with 1% (wt/vol) formaldehyde and subsequently quenched with glycine. After washing with PBS, the fixed samples were suspended in cell lysis buffer (5-mM PIPES-KCl pH8.0, 85-mM KCl, 0.5% (vol/vol) NP40), and collected nuclei were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C as nuclear pellets or nuclear lysates dissolved in nuclei lysis buffer (50-mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 10-mM EDTA, 1% (wt/vol) SDS). For Nrf2 ChIP, lysates were thawed and sonicated with Sonifier (BRANSON) to obtain chromatin fragments of 300\u20131,000\u2009bp, and 10-fold-diluted with ChIP dilution buffer (16.7-mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 1.2-mM EDTA, 0.01% (wt/vol) SDS, 1.1% (vol/vol) TrironX100, 167-mM NaCl). For Pol II, p65, C/EBP\u03b2, H3K27me3, H3K27Ac and H3K4me3 ChIP, nuclear pellets were thawed and suspended in buffer NUC (15-mM Hepes pH 7.5, 60-mM KCl, 15-mM NaCl, 0.32-mM sucrose, 3-\u03bcM CaCl2) and digested with MNase (New England Biolabs). After doubling-dilution with a sonication buffer (90-mM Hepes pH 7.9, 220-mM NaCl, 10-mM EDTA, 1% (vol/vol) NP-40, 0.2% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% (wt/vol) SDS), nuclei were homogenized with a Bioruptor (Tosho denki). After washing, a complex of nuclear proteins/DNAs and antibodies against Nrf2 (Cell Signaling technology; D1Z9C; 1:250 dilution), Pol II (Santa Cruz; sc-9001; 1:24 dilution), p65 (Cell Signaling technology; D14E12; 1:120 dilution), C/EBP\u03b2 (Santa Cruz; sc-150; 1:24 dilution), H3K27me3 (Cosmo Bio; MABI0323; 1:240 dilution), H3K27Ac (Cosmo Bio; MABI0309; 1:240 dilution) and H3K4me3 (Cosmo Bio; MABI0004; 1:240 dilutions) was retrieved with Protein A- and Protein G-Dynabeads (Life Technologies). After the cross-linking was reversed, chromatin fragments were treated with RNase A and proteinase K. DNA was purified with phenol-chloroform extraction or Ampure XP (Beckman Coulter). In the ChIP-qPCR analyses, the values from the immunoprecipitated samples were normalized to that from the input DNA. Primer sequences are available on request. ChIP-seq libraries were prepared from ~1\u2009ng each of ChIP and input samples using the Ovation Ultralow DR Multiplex System 1\u20138 (NuGEN, 0330-32). Libraries were clonally amplified in a flow cell and sequenced with Illumina Hiseq 2500 (Illumina) to generate paired-end sequences. BMDMs from two independent mice were used for the ChIP-seq, and the sum of sequenced reads from two samples was subjected to following analyses. Sequenced reads were mapped to the mouse genome51 (mm9) with bwa52 (ver. 0.6.2-r126). Paired reads uniquely mapped to the genome were extracted using samtools53 (ver. 0.1.18). The peaks were called using a model-based analysis of ChIP-seq (macs54, ver. 2.1.0) using P<0.0005 as a threshold. The Nrf2 ChIP-seq data of Hepa1 cells obtained in a previous study were re-peak called in the same manner. Peaks were annotated with BEDtools55 and a ChIPpeakAnno package56 (ver. 2.10.0). For the de novo motif discovery, the sequences of the \u221225-bp to +25-bp region from peak summits were analysed with a rGADEM package (ver. 2.0.10, Arnaud Droit, Raphael Gottardo, Gordon Robertson and Leiping Li (2014). rGADEM: de novo motif discovery). BMDMs were incubated with 5-ng\u2009ml\u22121 LPS and 100-\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 alum (Thermo Scientific; Imject Alum Adjuvant) with or without DEM for 24\u2009h. The concentration of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in the culture medium was measured using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Approximately 1\u2009kb upstream region of the IL6 gene TSS containing the WT ARE (GCTGAGTCA) or mutated ARE (AGATCTGAC) was conjugated to the translation start site of the NanoLuc gene in the pNL2.2 vector (Promega). 293T cells (2.0 \u00d7 103 cells per well) were plated in 96-well plates 24\u2009h before transfection. The NanoLuc reporter vectors were co-transfected with pQC-FLAG-hNRF2T80R plasmid33 and pcDNA3-p65 plasmid using Lipofectamin 3000 Reagent (Thermo) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 48\u2009h of the transfection, the luminescence was quantified and normalized using Nano-Glo Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega). Raw264.7 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Right before the treatment with DEM and LPS, the medium was changed to low-glucose-DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. An amount of 100-\u03bcM of DEM with or without 20-ng\u2009ml\u22121 LPS were added to the medium, and the cells were harvested after 4\u2009h. The cells were washed with PBS and crosslinked with 0.5-mM DTME and 0.5-mM DSP, which were quenched by 5-mM cysteine after 30\u2009min. The crosslinked cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the supernatant was collected and used for immunoprecipitation with 5-\u03bcg antibody specific for Nrf2 (Cell Signaling Technology; D1Z9C-XP) per sample. Precipitated samples together with input samples were analysed by immunoblot analysis, for which anti-Nrf2 (ref. 50) (1:100), anti-CBP (Santa Cruz; sc-1211, 1:2,000), anti-MED16 (Abcam; ab130996, 1:5,000) and anti-MED24 (Bethyl lab; A301-472A, 1:2,000) antibodies were used. The expression vector to express the guide RNA and Cas9 was produced using px330 plasmid. Raw264.7 cells were co-transduced with two types of px330 (ref. 57) those express guide RNAs specific for upstream and downstream regions of Nrf2-binding region, and selected with puromycin. Mice were subcutaneously administered with 150-\u03bcg myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35\u201355 peptide (AnaSpec) and complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Difco) containing 0.8-mg Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the abdomen. To support penetration of the blood\u2013brain barrier, 200-ng pertussis toxin was intraperitoneally administered on days 0 and 2. EAE clinical signs were scored as follows: 0, normal; 1, limp tail or hind limb weakness; 2, both of limp tail and hind limb weakness; 3, partial hind limb paralysis; and 4, complete hind limb paralysis. In vivo IL6-luc luminescence was measured with an IVIS SpectrumCT (PerkinElmer) after intraperitoneal injection of luciferin (Promega). For quantification, IL6-luc luminescence from the ventral midline area of EAE-induced mice was measured with Living Image version 4.3. Mice on the C57BL/6 background were shaved on their back at the day before imaging analysis. For the cutaneous S. aureus infection model, mice on the ICR background were shaved on their back and inoculated intra-dermally with mid-logarithmic growth phase S. aureus 834 strain (3 \u00d7 106 colony forming units) in 100-\u03bcl of sterile PBS using a 27-gauge syringe. In vivo bioluminescence was evaluated at 0, 2, 24 and 48\u2009h after inoculation.

        "abstract": "(a) Aim: The purpose of this study is to clarify an unknown function of Annexin A2-binding S100A proteins in tumor growth, cell cycle progression and invasion. Annexin A2 is a membrane bound protein originally identified as v-Src substrate, and often found to be overexpressed in many types of cancers. As a multicompartmental protein that orchestrates a spectrum of dynamic membrane-related events, it is associated with actin cytoskeleton control, vesicle formation and intercellular interaction.  (b) Methods and Results: During our proteomics analysis using solid tumor cell lines, we identified both Annexin A2 and S100A proteins in cancer stem cell-rich population. We next examined S100A proteins expression in several Head and Neck cancer PDX samples. Immunohistochemical data from in vivo specimens as well as western blots showed that S100A expression abundance was well associated with poor prognosis. Annexin A2 has been indicated to be involved in malignant phenotypes such as invasion and metastasis, and Annexin A2 and S100A form (S100-Annexin A2)x2 dimers, we next examined roles of S100A proteins in cancer, by using shRNA-mediated depletion experiments.  (c) New Findings: Depletion of S100A from PDX-derived cancer cells resulted in loss of both in vivo tumor formation and invasion. Furthermore, cell cycle progression was inhibited by the depletion, suggesting its potential role in proliferation controls. Similar to the mutant Ras-driven tumors, EGFR-overexpression increased S100A gene expresssion.  (d) Conclusion: These results strongly suggest that increases in S100A plays significant roles in cancer cell proliferation and invasion.   Note:  This abstract was not presented at the meeting.

However, no published studies have evaluated the frequency of vector integrations near exon 1 of the LMO2 locus. We identified a high incidence region (HIR) of vector integration using PCR techniques in the upstream region close to the LMO2 transcription start site in the TPA-Mat T cell line. The integration frequency of the HIR was one per 4.46 x 10(4) cells. This HIR was also found in Jurkat T cells but was absent from HeLa cells. Furthermore, using human cord blood-derived CD34+ cells we identified a HIR in a similar region as the TPA-Mat T cell line. One of the X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) patients that developed leukemia after gene therapy had a vector integration site in this HIR. Therefore, the descriptions of the location and the integration frequency of the HIR presented here may help us to better understand vector-induced leukemogenesis.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the appropriate volume of saline to obtain a beneficial effect of arthroscopic lavage and the prognostic factors related to the clinical effect in a refractory rheumatoid knee. Arthroscopic lavage or arthrocentesis was performed in a random manner in 142 patients with relapsing rheumatoid arthritis. All patients were followed up for 24 months. Intra-articular lavage with 5 l (p < 0.01) or 3 l (p < 0.05) of saline gave better clinical results than did arthrocentesis. There was no significant difference between the cumulative incidence of recurrence of knee synovitis in patients who underwent arthrocentesis and that in patients who underwent lavage with 1 l of saline. Cox regression analysis showed that patients with knee arthritis of more than 6 months in duration and with Larsen grade II or less were more responsive to lavage with 5 or 3 l of saline. The duration of the effect of lavage with 3 l of saline was increased 2.9-fold (p = 0.04) by injection of both steroids and high molecular weight hyaluronan. No bleeding or infectious complications occurred after those procedures. Arthroscopic lavage with 5 l of saline is safe and has good therapeutic effects for rheumatoid knees with mild destruction in which arthritis has persisted for more than 6 months. Lavage with 3 l of saline is recommended when intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and high molecular weight hyaluronan is performed after lavage.",

However, loss of motion occurs postoperatively in most cases. In our study of 59 rheumatoid patients, the results of the transposition of distal strips of retinaculum into the radiocarpal and ulnocarpal joints for interposition arthroplasty to maintain wrist motion (interposition group), and transposition below the extensors to provide a gliding surface (SK group) were evaluated. The distal end of the ulna was fixed to the radius with poly-L-lactic acid screws, and a proximal strip of retinaculum was placed above the extensors after synovectomy of the rheumatoid wrist. Clinical symptoms, radiographic changes, and postoperative complications were assessed 3-9 years (mean 5.9 years) postoperatively. Patients in the interposition group showed better postoperative results, including wrist motion, than those of patients in the SK group. Both procedures resulted in only minor complications such as superficial skin necrosis, hematoma, and superficial infection. We concluded that interposition arthroplasty combined with the S-K procedure using a distal strip of retinaculum might be a safe and appropriate method for wrist reconstruction following synovectomy of a rheumatoid wrist.",

All patients were followed up for 6 months.One hundred eighteen RA patients (80 knees in the arthrocentesis group, 81 knees in the no-arthrocentesis group) were included. The proportion of no relapses in the arthrocentesis group was higher than that in the no-arthrocentesis group. In the arthrocentesis group, regression analysis showed that duration of knee arthritis (<5 months), CRP (<4 mg/dl), and Larsen grade (<grade II) were the significant predictors.Arthrocentesis is effective in reducing the risk for arthritis relapse by intra-articular hyaluronan injection to rheumatoid knees with joint effusion. Predicting responders are duration of knee arthritis, CRP, and radiological scores.",

Duration of morning stiffness, number of swollen joints, serum rheumatoid factor (RF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and radiographs of hands and feet (Sharp/van der Heijde score) were assessed at each follow-up. Outcome was defined as damage seen on radiography.One hundred fourteen patients were followed up for 10 years. Logistic regression analysis showed that high MRI score, CRP, and RF positivity were associated with radiologic progression. The MRI score at baseline was a better predictor than CRP level and RF positivity at entry.The assessment of synovial membrane enhancement and bone erosion by MRI of the wrist in early RA is very helpful to predict erosive outcome.",

        "abstract": "The results of arthroscopic synovectomy in rheumatoid knees were examined. Forty-nine knees of 44 patients (17 knees of males\n and 32 knees of females) with an average age of 55.9 years at the time of operation were examined. The average postoperative\n observation period was 6.4 years. Arthroscopic synovectomy was carried out by using a shaver and a punch. In the final examination,\n 72% of the cases showed good or excellent results. The clinical results at the final examination were inferior in cases where\n the preoperative roentgenographic classification and the degree of cartilage damage were more than Larsen II and grade 2,\n respectively. The preoperative erythrocyte sedimentation rate was found to be correlated with the postoperative clinical results.\n Postoperative results were poor in cases with a preoperative flexion contracture of 15\u00b0 or more. A comparison of preoperative\n and postoperative X-ray findings showed aggravation in 47 of the 49 knees. The results indicate that arthroscopic synovectomy\n may be effective for early-stage cases, in which rheumatoid arthritis is well controlled and there is no flexion contracture.\n However, the results also suggest that this operation is not effective for stopping articular destruction.",

In group I, the degree of joint effusion and the serological values of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IgG-RF, and rheumatoid factor (RF) tended to be higher than those in the other groups at the time of our initial examination. The synovial fluid concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 and IgG-RF in group I were significantly higher than those in the other groups. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-determined stage and histological assessment of synovial inflammation also tended to be higher in group I than in the other groups. This study revealed that it might be possible to predict the outcome of cases of monoarthritis by examining IL-1\u03b2 and IgG-RF levels in the synovial fluid, in addition to various elevated inflammation signs in the knee joint.",

        "abstract": "Autophagy is a dynamic recycling system using lysosomal proteolysis that produces new proteins and energy for cellular renovation and homeostasis. Although macroautophagy is known to serve as a survival pathway in many cancer cells, the role of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective protein degradation system, in cancer is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated that lysosomal proteolysis, but not macroautophagy, attenuated apoptosis induced by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, crizotinib, in the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, EBC1. In EBC1 cells, crizotinib induced BIM-dependent apoptosis, which was enhanced by inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis. Moreover, degradation of the pro-survival protein, MCL1, by the ubiquitin-proteasome system was induced by inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis, and by inhibition of the expression of the CMA mediators, HSC70 (heat shock cognate protein 70\u00a0kDa) and LAMP2A (lysosome membrane protein type 2A), suggesting the existence of a CMA-mediated MCL1 stabilization system in cancer cells. Indeed, the same MCL1 stabilization system was also observed in several NSCLC cell lines; in these cells, their specific molecular-targeted drug or ABT-263 (Navitoclax), the specific inhibitor of BCL-2 and BCL-X, but not of MCL1, effectively induced apoptosis in combination with CMA inhibition. Therefore, our results indicate a novel mechanism of MCL1 stabilization in lung cancers by CMA, and a candidate efficient combination chemotherapy method against lung cancers.",

Accumulating evidence has shown that the tumor microenvironment, accompanied by inflammation and tissue remodeling, is important for cancer proliferation, metastasis, and maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that self-renew and generate the diverse cells comprising the tumor. Furthermore, p53 has been demonstrated to inhibit inflammatory responses, and functional loss of p53 causes excessive inflammatory reactions. Moreover, the generation and maintenance of CSCs are supported by the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Considering that the functions of p53 inhibit reprogramming of somatic cells to stem cells, p53 may have a major role in the inflammatory microenvironment as a tumor suppressor. Here, we review our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the roles of p53 in regulation of the inflammatory microenvironment, tumor microenvironment, and tumor suppression.",

However, the role of the HH-GLI1 pathway in cancer and the activation mechanism of GLI1 in HH signalling after dissociation from its inhibitor, SUFU, are not fully understood. Here, we found that GLI1 associated with the methylosome protein 50 (MEP50)/protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) complex and was methylated. Association of MEP50/PRMT5 with GLI1 was enhanced and expression of MEP50 and PRMT5 was activated by HH signals, suggesting their role in positive feedback regulation. Methylated GLI1 lost its ability to bind ubiquitin ligase ITCH/NUMB, resulting in nuclear accumulation and activation of GLI1. Moreover, protein expression of GLI1 was enhanced by MEP50/PRMT5 and expression of MEP50, PRMT5, and GLI1 target genes was upregulated in HH-expressing cancers. These results suggest that MEP50/PRMT5 is important for HH signal-induced GLI1 activation, especially in cancers.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is classified into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several gene mutations that contribute to aberrant cell proliferation have been identified in lung adenocarcinoma, a part of NSCLC. Various anticancer drugs that target these mutated molecules have been developed for NSCLC treatment. However, although molecularly targeted drugs are initially effective for patients, the 5-year survival rate remains low because of tumor relapse. Therefore, more effective drugs for lung cancer treatment should be developed. The hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway contributes to organ development and stem cell maintenance, and aberrant activation of this signaling pathway is observed in various cancers including lung cancer. In lung cancer, HH signaling pathway upregulates cancer cell proliferation and maintains cancer stem cells as well as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Furthermore, physical contact between CAFs and NSCLC cells induces HH signaling pathway activation in NSCLC cells to enhance their metastatic potential. Therefore, HH signaling pathway inhibitors could be a useful option for lung cancer therapy.",

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic devices provide advantages including precise positioning of cells and throughput, however device fabrication is time-consuming and requires specialised skills. Agarose pads are a popular alternative, however cells often clump together, which hinders single cell quantitation. Here, we imprint agarose pads with micro-patterned 'capsules', to trap individual cells and 'lines', to direct cellular growth outwards in a straight line. We implement this micro-patterning into multi-pad devices called CapsuleHotel and LineHotel for high-throughput imaging. CapsuleHotel provides ~65,000 capsule structures per mm that isolate individual Escherichia coli cells. In contrast, LineHotel provides ~300 line structures per mm that direct growth of micro-colonies. With CapsuleHotel, a quantitative single cell dataset of ~10,000 cells across 24 samples can be acquired and analysed in under 1\u2009hour. LineHotel allows tracking growth of\u2009>\u200910 micro-colonies across 24 samples simultaneously for up to 4 generations. These easy-to-use devices can be provided in kit format, and will accelerate discoveries in diverse fields ranging from microbiology to systems and synthetic biology.",

        "abstract": "The geometrical confinement of small cell colonies gives differential cues to cells sitting at the periphery versus the core. To utilize this effect, for example to create spatially graded differentiation patterns of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in vitro or to investigate underpinning mechanisms, the confinement needs to be robust for extended time periods. To create highly repeatable micro-fabricated structures for cellular patterning and high-throughput data mining, we employed here a simple casting method to fabricate more than 800 adhesive patches confined by agarose micro-walls. In addition, a machine learning based image processing software was developed (open code) to detect the differentiation patterns of the population of hMSCs automatically. Utilizing the agarose walls, the circular patterns of hMSCs were successfully maintained throughout 15 days of cell culture. After staining lipid droplets and alkaline phosphatase as the markers of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, respectively, the mega-pixels of RGB color images of hMSCs were processed by the software on a laptop PC within several minutes. The image analysis successfully showed that hMSCs sitting on the more central versus peripheral sections of the adhesive circles showed adipogenic versus osteogenic differentiation as reported previously, indicating the compatibility of patterned agarose walls to conventional microcontact printing. In addition, we found a considerable fraction of undifferentiated cells which are preferentially located at the peripheral part of the adhesive circles, even in differentiation-inducing culture media. In this study, we thus successfully demonstrated a simple framework for analyzing the patterned differentiation of hMSCs in confined microenvironments, which has a range of applications in biology, including stem cell biology.",

A simple method was developed to cast a hydrogel solution without external power sources using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold with micro-channels. This study employed \u201cthe accumulation of vacuum pressure\u201d in a degassed lump of PDMS as a driving force for introducing agarose solution into the micro-channels. Sufficient vacuum pressure could be accumulated within 1 h in the PDMS elastomer that was acting as a vacuum tank, and 2 w/v% agarose solution could be aspirated into the micro-channels with widths from 100 to 2000 \u03bcm and a height of 19 \u03bcm, fully filling them. After the gelation and dehydration of agarose solution in the micro-channels, the patterns of agarose gel on the channels were successfully cast with a 90%-width accuracy. By using the repellency of agarose gel toward cell adhesion, patterned cultures of myoblasts and cortical neurons were successfully prepared. This technique is expected to be useful in repellency-guided cell patterning for various types of cells, with applications to cell\u2013cell interactions and axon guidance.",

This study has developed a simple vapor-based immobilization method using a compound bearing a fluoro-functional group on a cell culture surface with micro/nanoscale patterns. The vapor of a silane coupling agent containing the fluoro-functional group was introduced into the micro-/nanochannels of polydimethylsiloxane elastomer placed on the target surface in a vacuum desiccator. The agent was immobilized with a pattern shown only on the areas of the channels on the surface. Although it is difficult to introduce the agent solution into a sub-micrometer-width channel via a conventional liquid-based approach, the vapor can be introduced into nanochannels with an exceptionally narrow width of 800 nm and an exceptionally low height of 700 nm. The fluoro-functional group area was clearly found to repel the adhesion of fluorescent-dye-conjugated fibronectin molecules. Four different types of cells, mouse skeletal myoblast cell line C2C12 cells, human cervix adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa cells, bovine artery endothelial cells HH, and mouse mammary gland epithelial cell line NMuMG cells, were prepared and each type was seeded onto the immobilized culture surfaces of glass and polystyrene dishes. The cells were adhered on the non-fluoro-functional group immobilized area and the cell pattern was maintained during atleast a 39 days of cultivation. This method is expected to be useful for simple and stable cell patterning in biological and medical fields.",

        "abstract": "High-throughput microscopy of bacterial cells elucidated fundamental cellular processes including cellular heterogeneity and cell division homeostasis. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic devices provide advantages including precise positioning of cells and throughput, however device fabrication is time-consuming and requires specialised skills. Agarose pads are a popular alternative, however cells often clump together, which hinders single cell quantitation. Here, we imprint agarose pads with micro-patterned 'capsules', to trap individual cells and 'lines', to direct cellular growth outwards in a straight line. We implement this micro-patterning into multi-pad devices called CapsuleHotel and LineHotel for high-throughput imaging. CapsuleHotel provides ~65,000 capsule structures per mm that isolate individual Escherichia coli cells. In contrast, LineHotel provides ~300 line structures per mm that direct growth of micro-colonies. With CapsuleHotel, a quantitative single cell dataset of ~10,000 cells across 24 samples can be acquired and analysed in under 1\u2009hour. LineHotel allows tracking growth of\u2009>\u200910 micro-colonies across 24 samples simultaneously for up to 4 generations. These easy-to-use devices can be provided in kit format, and will accelerate discoveries in diverse fields ranging from microbiology to systems and synthetic biology.",

        "abstract": "A biofilm has a unique structure composed of microorganisms, extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), etc., and it is layered on a substrate in water. In material science, it is important to detect the biofilm formed on a surface to prevent biofouling. EPSs, the major component of the biofilm, mainly consist of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Because these biomolecules have a variety of hydrophilicities or hydrophobicities, the substrate covered with the biofilm shows different wettability from the initial state. To detect the biofilm formation, this study employed a liquid-squeezing-based wettability assessment method with a simple wettability index: the liquid-squeezed diameter of a smaller value indicates higher wettability. The method is based on the liquid-squeezing behaviour of a liquid that covers sample surfaces when an air-jet is applied. To form the biofilm, polystyrene surfaces were immersed and incubated in a water-circulated bioreactor that had collected microorganisms in ambient air. After the 14-d incubation, good formation of the biofilm on the surfaces was confirmed by staining with crystal violet. Although the contact angles of captive bubbles on the surfaces with the biofilm were unmeasurable, the liquid-squeezing method could distinguish between hydrophilic and hydrophobic initial surfaces with and without biofilm formation using the diameter of the liquid-squeezed area. The surface wettability is expected to be a promising property for in-situ detection of biofilm formation on a macroscopic scale.",

        "abstract": "Among many thermochemical cycle hydrogen production methods, the iodine sulfur (IS) cycle, originally proposed by General Atomics is expected to be a clean, economical, and sustainable method of large-scale hydrogen production using nuclear heat at high temperature. However, there still exist some technical problems to be solved before realization of industrial hydrogen production using the IS process. One such problem is purification of Bunsen reaction products. The Bunsen reaction products in the IS cycle, H 2SO 4 and HIx phases, containing minor acids of HI and H 2SO 4, respectively, should be purified in order to avoid occurrence of side reactions. In this paper, simulation study on the purification of H 2SO 4 and HIx phases were carried out at pressure both higher and lower than 1 atm by a chemical process simulator ESP with the thermodynamic database based on the Mixed Solvent Electrolyte model. The results showed that purification of H 2SO 4 under subatmospheric pressure could increase the conversion of HI, improve the selectivity of SO 2, and promote I 2 and SO 2 conversion products distributing in the vapor phase. Although purification of HIx phase under subatmospheric pressure could also increase the conversion of H 2SO 4, it did not facilitate the occurrence of the reverse Bunsen reaction. \u00a9 2012 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Current Ru0026D on the thermochemical water splitting iodine-sulfur (IS) process in Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) is summarized. Reactors were fabricated with industrial materials and verified by test operations: a Bunsen reactor, a H 2 SO 4  decomposer, and a HI decomposer. Component materials of the reactors were stable in the operation environment. Small amount of H 2 SO 4  in the anolyte solution in an electro-electrodialysis (EED) cell had no negative impact on cell performance parameters. Relationship between cell solution composition and temperature and cell parameters was formulated by experimental data. Demonstration of the test facility with process design of 100\u00a0L/h hydrogen production is performed to verify integrity of process components and stability of hydrogen production. Tests of sections were first conducted individually to show material processing rates were controllable. Based on the result, an 8-h continuous operation of the total IS process was performed in February 2016 with H 2  production rate of 10\u00a0L/h. Demonstrations are planned for longer operation period and higher H 2  production rate after improvement of components to prevent troubles.",

The thermochemical water-splitting iodine-sulfur (IS) process uses heat from nuclear or solar power and thus is a promising next-generation thermochemical hydrogen production method that is independent of fossil fuels and can provide energy security. This paper presents the current state of research and development (Ru0026D) of the IS process based on membrane techniques using solar energy at a medium temperature of 600\u00a0\u00b0C. Membrane design strategies have the most potential for making the IS process using solar energy highly efficient and economical and are illustrated here in detail. Three aspects of membrane design proposed herein for the IS process have led to a considerable improvement of the total thermal efficiency of the process: membrane reactors, membranes, and reaction catalysts. Experimental studies in the applications of these membrane design techniques to the Bunsen reaction, sulfuric acid decomposition, and hydrogen iodide decomposition are discussed.",

Silica membranes, referred to here as HTMOS membranes, were prepared via counter-diffusion chemical vapor deposition on  \u03b3 -alumina-coated  \u03b1 -alumina support tubes with outer diameters of 10\u00a0mm. Special attention was devoted to obtain high H 2 /HI selectivity, high H 2  permeance, and good stability in the presence of corrosive HI gas. The effects of the deposition conditions, temperature, and period were investigated. The HTMOS membrane prepared at 450\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min exhibited high H 2 /HI selectivity (u003e175) with H 2  permeance on the order of 10 \u22127 \u00a0mol\u00a0Pa \u22121 \u00a0m \u22122 \u00a0s \u22121 .

        "abstract": "We previously proposed ParaBIT (parallel inter-board optical interconnection technology), and developed a prototype front-end module, called ParaBIT-0, with a total throughput of 28 Gb/s (700 Mb/s\u00d740 ch). Aiming at higher throughput, lower cost, and further miniaturization, we are now developing a version, called ParaBIT-1, which is designed to achieve a total throughput of 60 Gb/s (1.25 Gbit/s\u00d7480-ch). To achieve a compact and high-throughput module, we developed a new compact high-density packaging structure and cost-effective optical coupling system for ParaBIT-1. This packaging structure enabled us to reduce the volume of ParaBIT-1 to 9 cc, which is about one-third that of ParaBIT-0 (25 cc). The optical coupling system consists of a new structure 24-fiber BF (bare fiber) connector whose main parts are made of molded plastic and a 24-channel optical coupling component using new polymeric optical waveguide film. The optical coupling component is composed of a 24-ch waveguide film with 45\u00b0 mirrors and the 24-fiber BF connector interface, and can be assembled by passive alignment. The film has high thermal stability to allow soldering reflow processes, and is fabricated by direct photo-patterning. ParaBIT-1 met the design target of 1.25 Gb/s per channel",

        "abstract": "To estimate the combined effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on microalgae, three typical and worldwide freshwater species, the green alga Scenedesmus acuminatus, the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana, and the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, as well as mixes of these three species were continuously cultured in controlled environment chambers with CO2 at 390 and 1000\u00a0ppm and temperatures of 20, 25, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C. CO2 and temperature significantly affected the production of microalgae. The cell productivity increased under elevated CO2 and temperature. Although the green alga dominated in the mixed culture within all CO2 and temperature conditions, rising temperature and CO2 intensified the competition of the cyanobacterium with other microalgae. CO2 affected the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) characteristics of the green alga and the cyanobacterium. Elevated CO2 induced the generation of humic substances in the EPS fractions of the green alga, the cyanobacterium, and the mixed culture. The extracellular carbohydrates of the diatom and the extracellular proteins of the cyanobacterium increased with elevated CO2 and temperature, while the extracellular carbohydrates and proteins of the green alga and the mixes increased under elevated CO2 and temperature. There were synergistic effects of CO2 and temperature on the productivity and the EPS of microalgae. Climate change related CO2 and temperature increases will promote autochthonous organic carbon production in aquatic ecosystems and facilitate the proliferation of cyanobacteria, which potentially changes the carbon cycling and undermines the functioning of ecosystems.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Highly unsaturated fatty acids such as 20:5n3 (EPA) are both hormone precursors and cell membrane components, making them important nutrients for aquatic animals. Many animals must obtain EPA from their diets because they cannot synthesize enough EPA to meet their requirements, and algae are the main source of EPA in aquatic ecosystems. In a previous study, we detected EPA in the faeces of  Danio rerio , a freshwater fish, even though the fish consumed a green algae diet that did not contain EPA. The objective of this study was to determine why EPA was detected in fish faeces. A significant positive relationship was detected between the number of heterotrophic protozoa and the concentration of EPA in the faeces, which suggests that this EPA was of protozoan origin. In addition, another experiment showed that protozoa adhered to faeces far more than the green algal diet remnants, which indicates that protozoa preferred to swarm on faeces. Furthermore, we cultured protozoa in an EPA-free medium and fed them a bacterial diet also lacking EPA, and found that  Cyclidium  sp. synthesized EPA de novo. The results demonstrate that protozoa produce essential fatty acids and enhance the nutritional quality of animal faeces in detritus-based food webs in freshwater ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "An anaerobic membrane bioreactor was configured for methanogenic degradation of cellulose-containing sewage. The degradation performance and microbial changes were evaluated under five hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The results indicated the methane production was largely enhanced with 92.6% efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) converting to methane and 80% proportion of methane in produced biogas, meanwhile the biomass yield presented the fewest at the shortest HRT 8h. Enhanced methane production with decreased biomass yield was attributed to an association between fungi and methanogens. Microbial analysis showed fungi Basidiomycota and methanogen Methanoregula apparently established the association, especially Basidiomycota reaching 93% relative abundance at HRT 8h. Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) and biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests suggested the association was derived from H production by fungi and H consumption by methanogens, during the process of cellulose degradation. The methanogenic degradation of cellulose-containing sewage was markedly promoted via the fungi-methanogens syntrophic association.",

        "abstract": "It is essential to understand the combined effects of elevated CO and temperature on phytoplankton-zooplankton link when attempting to predict climate change responses of freshwater ecosystems. Phytoplankton species differ in stoichiometric and fatty acids composition, and this may result in phytoplankton-mediated effect on zooplankton at elevated CO and temperature. Beyond the isolated analysis of CO or temperature effect, few studies have assessed zooplankton growth under the phytoplankton-mediated effects of elevated CO and temperature. In this study, three algal species (green alga, diatom, cyanobacteria) were fed on zooplankton Daphnia magna, under the conditions of CO concentrations of ambient (390\u202fppm) and elevated (1000\u202fppm) levels and temperatures at 20, 25 and 30\u202f\u00b0C. Elevated CO increased the algal biomass, while it reduced the phosphorus (P) and \u03c93 polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c93 PUFAs) to carbon (C) ratios. Elevated temperature decreased the P/C ratios in all algal cultures and \u03c93 PUFAs/C ratios in the diatom and the cyanobacteria cultures. Phytoplankton-mediated effect of elevated CO reduced the growth of zooplankton fed on the green and the mixed three algae culture. The stimulation of zooplankton fed on the diatom and the cyanobacteria by elevated temperature can be offset by decreasing food P and \u03c93 PUFAs contents. The combined effects of elevated CO and temperature on the growth of daphnids were mainly mediated by \u03c93 PUFAs/C ratios in the phytoplankton. Rising temperature as a combined direct and indirectly phytoplankton-mediated effect on zooplankton may be able to ameliorate the negative effects of elevated CO. The results indicated that the combined effects of increased CO and temperature increased the fatty acid content of the green alga but not the other algae. This study highlighted that climate change with simultaneously increasing temperature and CO may entangle the carbon transfer in freshwater planktonic communities.",

Block copolymers composed of polystyrene and PIPAAm (St-IPAAms) having various chain lengths and compositions were synthesized by reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer radical polymerization. The St-IPAAm Langmuir film at an air\u2013water interface was horizontally transferred onto a hydrophobically modified glass substrate while regulating its density. Atomic force microscopy images clearly visualized nanoscaled sea\u2013island structures on the surface. By adjusting both the composition of St-IPAAms and the density of immobilized PIPAAms, a series of thermoresponsive surfaces was prepared to control the strength, rate, and quality of cell adhesion and detachment through changes in temperature across the lower critical solution temperature range of PIPAAm molecules. In addition, a two-dimensional cell structure (cell sheet) was more rapidly recovered on the optimized surfaces than on conventional PIPAAm surfaces. These unique PIPAAm surfaces are suggested to be useful for controlling the strength of cell adhesion and detachment.",

        "abstract": " Epidermal cell sheet (ECS) transplantation immediately after aggressive endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been shown to be safe and effective in the prevention of esophageal strictures. This study evaluated the feasibility of ECS transplantation after endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) in a porcine model.  Six pigs underwent circumferential esophageal ESD under general anesthesia. Two weeks later, two pigs underwent EBD and transplantation of an autologous ECS, two underwent EBD alone, and two underwent endoscopic observation only (control).  The two pigs in the transplantation group underwent six ECS transplants after EBD with five of the six (83\u200a%) being successful, as shown by engraftment of transplanted ECSs after 7 days. No adverse events were observed. Stricture rates were lower in the two transplanted pigs (55\u200a% and 60\u200a%) than in the control (92.2\u200a% and 87.7\u200a%) and EBD-treated (71.7\u200a% and 78.2\u200a%) pigs. Infiltration of inflammatory cells was significantly lower in the transplanted pigs than in the control and EBD-treated pigs.  Preliminary results indicate the stability of the ECS transplantation procedure and the engraftment of transplanted ECS in the tears after EBD. This proof-of-concept study suggests that covering tears with ECSs after EBD may avoid re-strictures.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory chemokine that is associated with induction of chemotaxis and degranulation of neutrophils. IL-8 is overexpressed in many tumors, including colon and lung cancer, and recent studies demonstrated essential roles for IL-8 in tumor progression within the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the functions of IL-8 in tumor progression is unclear. In this study, we found that IL-8 is overexpressed in colon and lung cancer cells with cancer stem cell (CSC)-like characteristics and is required for CSC properties, including tumor-initiating abilities. These findings suggest that IL-8 plays an essential role in the development of CSCs. We also showed that IL-8 stimulation of colon and lung cancer cells-induced glucose uptake and expressions of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) and glucosamine fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (GFAT), a regulator of glucose flux to the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, resulting in enhancement of protein O-GlcNAcylation. We demonstrated that these events are required for the generation and maintenance CSC-like characteristics of colon and lung cancer cells. Moreover, an O-GlcNAcylation inhibitor, OSMI1, reduced CSC number and tumor development in vivo. Together, these results reveal that IL-8-induced O-GlcNAcylation is required for generation and maintenance of CSCs of colon and lung cancer cells and suggests this regulatory pathway as a candidate therapeutic target of CSCs.",

        "abstract": "Caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, is known to affect sleep-awake cycles, the stress response, and learning and memory. It has been suggested that caffeine influences synaptic plasticity, but the effects of caffeine on synaptic plasticity in the human brain remain unexplored. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of caffeine on long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effects in the primary motor cortex of healthy humans. Twelve healthy participants (six women and six men; mean age: 44.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u00a0years) underwent quadripulse magnetic stimulation with an inter-stimulus interval of 5\u00a0ms (QPS5) to induce LTP-like effects, 2\u00a0h after administration of either a caffeine (200\u00a0mg) or placebo tablet in a double-blind crossover design. We recorded motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) before and after QPS5. The degree of MEP enhancement was compared between the placebo and caffeine conditions. Neither active nor resting motor thresholds were influenced by caffeine administration. Following caffeine administration, the degree of potentiation significantly decreased in \"significant responders\", whose average MEP ratios were greater than 1.24 in the placebo condition. The observed reduction in potentiation following caffeine administration is consistent with the A receptor antagonistic effect of caffeine. This is the first report of an effect of caffeine on neural synaptic plasticity in the human brain, which is consistent with the caffeine-induced plasticity reduction observed in primate studies. Because we studied only a small number of subjects, we cannot firmly conclude that caffeine reduces LTP in humans. The present results will, however, be helpful when considering further or new clinical uses of caffeine.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundIn recent years, a variety of clinical types of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have come to be recognized. As some patients present with oculomotor abnormalities both clinically and pathologically, the progressive supranuclear palsy variant of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been proposed.AimTo describe atypical cases of motor neuron disease with abnormal extraocular movements mimicking progressive supranuclear palsy.MethodsWe present three motor neuron disease patients with slow saccades, who were aged 57, 63 and 62 years. Neurological examinations found vertical gaze palsy in two patients. The two patients who presented extrapyramidal signs were regarded as motor neuron disease with parkinsonism, whereas the other was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Their saccades were investigated by visually-guided saccade and memory-guided saccade tasks, and were compared with those of 14 age-matched normal participants (60.3 \u00b1 1.9 years).ResultsIn all these patients, the visually-guided saccade latencies were significantly prolonged compared with normal participants, whereas the memory-guided saccade latencies were not. The velocity and amplitude of saccades of the patients were significantly reduced in visually-guided saccade and memory-guided saccade in comparison with normal participants.ConclusionThe patterns of saccadic abnormalities in the patients were similar to those of progressive supranuclear palsy patients, suggesting that some patients with motor neuron disease show saccade abnormalities similar to those of progressive supranuclear palsy patients from the clinical and physiological perspective. Motor neuron disease with slow saccades and parkinsonism, as reported here, suggest the existence of progressive supranuclear palsy-variant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Introduction  Zonisamide (ZNS) was reported to be effective for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). However, anti-Parkinsonian mechanisms of ZNS remain unclear. Some reports suggest that abnormal cortical plasticity is related to pathophysiology of PD. Previous study revealed that Levodopa, which is a crucial drug for PD treatment, enhances plasticity-like effects induced by rTMS in normal subjects, or restores LTP-like effects in PD patients.    Objectives  We studied the influence of ZNS on the motor cortical LTP-like effect induced by Quadripulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (QPS) in normal subjects.    Materials and methods  24 healthy volunteers (12 men and 12 women; 65.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0years old) participated in this study. The study design was a double-blinded, complete crossover and placebo-controlled form. The subject took either ZNS (25\u00a0mg) or a placebo in each session. Two hours after a capsule intake, QPS was given over the left M1 after measuring the motor thresholds (RMT/AMT) and the baseline MEP size. QPS consists of bursts of four monophasic TMS pulses separated by inter-stimulus intervals of 5\u00a0ms, which is the best interval for LTP induction, and was repeated every 5\u00a0s for 30\u00a0min. We measured the MEP amplitude at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25\u00a0min after the end of the QPS. We divided the subjects into \u201cresponders\u201d and \u201cnon-responders\u201d according to a previously reported definition and compared the time courses between the experimental conditions in each group of subjects separately.    Results  14 participants were defined as a responder, and the other 10 were as a non-responder. There were no significant differences in the RMT, AMT, baseline MEP, or the single pulse TMS intensity that was used between responders and non-responders. ZNS significantly enhanced the LTP in non-responders ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.008), but not in responders ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.48).    Conclusion  ZNS significantly enhanced LTP in non-responders, but had no influence in responders. The mild LTP enhancement by ZNS shown here may partly explain its anti-Parkinsonian mechanisms.",

However, the proportion of patients with cortical cerebellar atrophy of unknown etiology with autoimmune-associated cerebellar ataxia and the actual effectiveness of immunotherapy in these diseases remain unknown.We measured the level of autoantibodies (including anti-gliadin antibody, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, and anti-thyroid antibody) in 58 Japanese patients with cerebellar ataxia, excluding those with multiple system atrophy, hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia, cancer, or those who were receiving phenytoin, and the efficacy of immunotherapy was assessed.Thirty-one of 58 (53%) patients were positive for anti-GAD antibody, anti-gliadin antibody, or anti-thyroid antibody. Seven of the 12 anti-gliadin antibody-positive patients, three of the four anti-GAD antibody-positive patients, and three of the six anti-thyroid antibody-positive patients responded well to immunotherapy, indicating that 59% of patients with ataxia-associated antibody-positive cerebellar ataxia undergoing immunotherapy responded well.Some patients with cerebellar ataxia have autoimmune conditions and diagnosing autoimmune cerebellar ataxia is therefore an important component in the care of patients with this disease entity.",

The invariant mass method in inverse kinematics was employed to reconstruct the energy spectrum. A sharp resonance state was observed at 42(5) keV above the neutron threshold. A comparison of the differential cross section leading to this state with a microscopic DWBA calculation allowed a J \u03c0 assignment of 5/2+ for this state.",

The decay energy spectrum of O*24 was reconstructed from the momenta of O23 and the neutron. The spin parity of the first excited state, observed at E x=4.65\u00b10. 14MeV, was determined to be J\u03c0=2 + from the angular distribution of the cross section. Higher-lying states were also observed. The quadrupole transition parameter \u03b2 2 of the 21+ state was deduced, for the first time, to be 0.15\u00b10.04. The relatively high excitation energy and small \u03b2 2 value are indicative of the N=16 shell closure in O24. \u00a9 2012 American Physical Society.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a compressive sensing method for the phased array weather radar (PAWR), which is capable of three-dimensional observation with high spatial resolution in 30 seconds. Because of the large amount of observation data, which is more than 1 gigabyte per minute, data compression is an essential technology to operate PAWR in the real world. Even though many conventional studies applied compressive sensing (CS) to weather radar measurements, their reconstruction quality should be further improved. To this end, we define a new cost function that expresses prior knowledge about weather radar measurements, i.e., local similarities. Since the cost function is convex, we can derive an efficient algorithm based on the so-called convex optimization techniques, in particular simultaneous direction method of multipliers (SDMM). Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods for real observation data with improvement of 4% in the normalized error.",
