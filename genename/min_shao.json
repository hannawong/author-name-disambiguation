        "abstract": "Two novel metal\u2013organic frameworks, [Cu(tpt)(bdc) 1/2 ] n \u00b7 n H 2 O ( 1 ) and [Zn(tpt)(bdc) 1/2 I] n ( 2 ) (tpt = 2,4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine, H 2 bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid), have been prepared by hydrothermal reactions. In complex 1 , Cu(I) center is in a trigonal coordination environment with bidentate tpt coordinating Cu(I) atoms to form 1D zigzag chains, and bdc ligand links the zigzag chains to form a 2D layered structure. In complex 2 , Zn(II) center is in a trigonal\u2013pyramidal environment with bidentate tpt coordinating Zn(II) atoms to form zigzag chains, and bdc links the zigzag chains to form metal\u2013organic framework which contains interesting hexagonal nano-channels. Keywords Cu(I)/Zn(II) complex metal\u2013organic framework Crystal structure 2,4,6-Tris(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine 1,4-Benzenedicarboxylate The design and assembly of metal\u2013organic frameworks are of great interest due to their intriguing structural motifs and potential applications in functional materials [1\u20133] . Multipyridyl and polycarboxylate ligands have received considerable attention owing to the variety of their coordination modes and structures of metal complexes [4] . The trigonal ligand 2,4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tpt) is of specially interest in recent years, as this essentially planar ligand has already afforded a number of unusual and high symmetrical metal\u2013organic frameworks [5] . Usually tpt is an exo-tridentate ligand, and the N atoms of three pyridyl groups can bind to different metal atoms. Its rigidity and triangular geometry can lead to formation of porous frameworks enclosing nano-porous cages [6,7] , cavities [8,9] , chambers [10] , and channels [11\u201313] . Although considerable studies have been done on metal-tpt two-component frameworks, the mixed-ligand metal\u2013organic frameworks containing tpt and other bridging organic ligands are less reported until now. 1,4-Benzenedicarboxylate (bdc) can act as good building block in constructing metal\u2013organic frameworks [14,15] , which possesses two carboxylate groups and exhibit varied coordinate modes. This makes it very appealing for design of metal\u2013organic frameworks with interesting structures and properties. To assemble mixed-ligand metal\u2013organic frameworks of tpt and bdc, hydrothermal synthesis should be powerful method, because tpt and biscarboxylate complexes often exhibit poor solubility. We report here two interesting microporous metal\u2013organic frameworks constructed by Cu(I)/Zn(II), tpt and bdc. Hydrothermal reaction [16] of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 , tpt, H 2 bdc and piperidine in a molar ratio of 2:1:1:2 at 180 \u00b0C yields [Cu(tpt)(bdc) 1/2 ] n \u00b7 n H 2 O ( 1 ), while hydrothermal reaction of ZnI 2 , tpt, H 2 bdc and piperidine in a molar ratio of 2:1:1:2 at 160 \u00b0C yields [Zn(tpt)(bdc) 1/2 I] n ( 2 ). Here piperidine acts as organic base. The X-ray structure analysis [17] revealed that complex 1 has a two-dimensional layered framework. As shown in Fig. 1 , each asymmetric structure unit contains one crystallographically independent copper(I) atom, one tpt and half of bdc ligand. The Cu(1) atom is in a trigonal coordination environment and coordinates to two pyridyl N atoms from different tpt and one O atom of bdc. The bond angles of N(1)\u2013Cu(1)\u2013N(6A), N(1)\u2013Cu(1)\u2013O(1) and O(1)\u2013Cu(1)\u2013N(6A) are 153.01(12), 99.85(11), 106.69(11)\u00b0, respectively. Each tpt ligand binds to two copper(I) centers through two pyridyl N atoms, while the third pyridyl N atom is uncoordinated. The bond lengths of Cu(1)\u2013N(1) and Cu(1)\u2013N(6A) are 1.923(3), 1.908(3) \u00c5, respectively. Two carboxylate groups of bdc coordinate to two copper(I) centers in a monodentate mode. The Cu(1)\u2013O(1) bond length is 2.289(3) \u00c5. Generally, tpt shows exo-tridentate coordinate mode in coordination polymers. In complex 1 , tpt acting as bidentate ligand bridges Cu(I) atoms to form one-dimensional zigzag chains. 1,4-Benzenedicarboxylate links the zigzag chains to form 2D layered structure. This framework exhibits large irregular rings, each constructing from four tpt, two bdc ligands and six Cu(I) atoms. In recent decade, 4,4\u2032-bipyridine has been widely used as bidentate bridging ligand to construct one-dimensional linear chains [19] . While constructing 1D zigzag chains, bidentate tpt ligand may be a good molecular building block because of its 120\u00b0 rigid angle [20] . In complex 2 , the asymmetric structure unit contains one zinc(II) atom, one coordinated I \u2212 , one tpt and half of bdc ligand ( Fig. 2 ). Zn(1) atom locates at the core of a distorted trigonal\u2013pyramidal geometry. The basal plane is constructed by the coordination of N(1), O(1) and I(1). The bond lengths of Zn(1)\u2013N(1), Zn(1)\u2013O(1) and Zn(1)\u2013I(1) are 2.052(4), 1.933(3), 2.5314(7) \u00c5, respectively. The bond angles of N(1)\u2013Zn(1)\u2013O(1), N(1)\u2013Zn(1)\u2013I(1) and O(1)\u2013Zn(1)\u2013I(1) are 115.30(15), 114.58(10), 119.81(11)\u00b0, respectively. The axial position is occupied by N(5A) atom with the Zn(1)\u2013N(5A) bond length of 2.090(4) \u00c5. The bond angle of N(1)\u2013Zn(1)\u2013N(5A) is 100.31(14)\u00b0. Other bond lengths and angles are normal as expected. Analogous to the coordination mode of tpt in copper complex 1 , tpt binds to two Zn(II) centers through two pyridyl N atoms, while the third pyridyl N atom is free. Tpt acting as bidentate bridging ligand links Zn(II) atoms to form zigzag chains. Both carboxylate groups of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate coordinate to Zn(II) centers in a monodentate mode. The bdc ligand acting as \u03bc 2 -bridge links Zn(tpt)I zigzag chains to form microporous metal\u2013organic framework. Along the b -axis, the framework exhibits intriguing hexagonal nano-channels ( Fig. 3 ). In each hexagonal channel, two of the six edges are \u03c0 -faces of bdc units and the other four edges are built by tpt ligands. The approximate dimensions of the hexagonal channels are 1.23 nm \u00d7 1.63 nm. Comparing the structures of 1 and 2 , the former exhibits a trigonal coordination geometry around Cu(I) centers with 153.01\u00b0 bond angle of N(1)\u2013Cu(1)\u2013N(6A), while the latter shows a trigonal\u2013pyramidal geometry around Zn(II) centers with 100.31\u00b0 angle of N(1)\u2013Zn(1)\u2013N(5A). Such arrangements result in the structural difference of metal-tpt zigzag chains and metal\u2013organic frameworks. In conclusion, two novel microporous metal\u2013organic frameworks have been assembled by tpt and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate ligands. The frameworks consist of Cu(I)/Zn(II)-tpt zigzag chains and bdc bidentate bridges. The Zn(II) complex exhibits intriguing hexagonal nano-channels.

        "abstract": "Five new metal-organic frameworks based on 2,4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tpt) ligand have been hydrothermally synthesized. Reaction of tpt and AgNO 3 in an acidic solution at 180 degrees C yields {[Ag(Htpt)(NO3)]NO(3).4H2O}n (1).Ag(I) is trigonally coordinated by two pyridyl nitrogen and one nitrato oxygen to form a 1D zigzag chain. Reaction of tpt with CuSO4 affords {[Cu2(tpt)2(SO4)2(H2O)2].4H2O}n (2). Copper(II) is bonded to two pyridyl nitrogen, two sulfato oxygen, and two water oxygen atoms to form an elongated octahedral geometry. Each H2O ligand bridges two copper(II), whereas sulfate bridges copper(II) via micro-1,3 and micro-1,1 fashions. The copper(II)-sulfate-H2O2D layers are linked by bidentate tpt to form a 3D polymeric structure. Reaction of Cu(SO4)2, tpt, and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (H4btec) in the presence of piperidine gives [Cu(tpt)(H2btec)1/2]n (3). Copper(I) is located in a trigonal-pyramidal coordination environment and coordinated by three pyridyl nitrogen of tpt in a plane, whereas a carboxylate oxygen is coordinated to the copper(I) axially. The tpt-Cu forms a layer, and the layers are linked through H 2btec2- to form a 2D double-layered coordination polymer. Replacing CuSO4 with ZnI2 in the synthesis gives {[Zn(tpt)(btec)1/2].H2O}n (4). Zinc(II) is in a distorted tetrahedral geometry and linked through bidentate tpt and exotetradentate btec4- to form a 2D coordination grid. Reaction of tpt with CuCN leads to the assembly of a 3D metal-organic framework [Cu3(CN)3(tpt)]n (5). Copper(I) is trigonally coordinated by one pyridyl nitrogen and two cyanides to form an intriguing honeycomb architecture. Luminescence study shows that 1, 3, 4, and 5 have blue fluorescence, which can be assigned to be ligand-centered emissions. Thermal analysis shows that all of these complexes are quite stable, and especially for 4, the framework is stable up to 430 degrees C.",

Complex 1 exhibits an unusual polymeric network contains two molecular squares and a rectangle. Abstract Hydrothermal reaction of ZnSO 4 \u00b7 7H 2 O with 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H 3 btc) and 2,6-bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine (btp) afforded a novel metal\u2013organic network {[Zn 3 (btc) 2 (btp) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] \u00b7 4H 2 O} n ( 1 ) with a supramolecular cocrystal [H 3 btc \u00b7 btp \u00b7 H 2 O] n ( 2 ). The complex 1 exhibits an unusual network containing two molecular squares and a rectangle. The networks interpenetrate to make a 3D metal\u2013organic framework, which is quite thermal stable. Compound 2 shows a 2D supramolecular network assembled through strong hydrogen bonds. Keywords 1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid 2,6-Bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine Metal\u2013organic framework Crystal structure Porous metal\u2013organic frameworks are of great interest due to their intriguing structural motifs as well as potential applications in functional materials, such as catalysis, zeolite-like porous material, and hydrogen-storage material [1\u20133] . Much effort has been focused on the design and controlled synthesis of porous metal\u2013organic frameworks. The diversity in such framework structures greatly depends on the selection of metal ions, organic ligands and reaction pathways. Polycarboxylate, multipyridyl and triazolate ligands have received considerable attention in constructing metal\u2013organic frameworks owing to the variety of their coordination modes [4,5] . Our strategy has involved the use of mixed ligands such as polycarboxylate and N -heterocyclic ligands for creating novel framework structures [6] . The rigid trigonal ligand 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H 3 btc) is of specially interest in recent years, because this essentially planar ligand has already afforded a number of unusual multidimensional metal\u2013organic frameworks [7,8] . 1,2,4-Triazole and its derivatives are also of increasing interest in constructing coordination polymers. 2,6-Bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine (btp) possesses seven potential N -donor atoms, which makes it very appealing for design of coordination polymers with interesting structures and properties. However, only two btp complexes have been documented to date [9,10] . Herein, we report an unusual metal\u2013organic network {[Zn 3 (btc) 2 (btp) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] \u00b7 4H 2 O} n ( 1 ) and a supramolecular cocrystal [H 3 btc \u00b7 btp \u00b7 H 2 O] n ( 2 ). A mixture of ZnSO 4 \u00b7 7H 2 O (0.2 mmol), H 3 btc (0.2 mmol), btp (0.2 mmol) and water (10 mL) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel reactor, which was heated at 120 \u00b0C for 3 days under autogenous pressure. Upon cooling to room temperature at a rate of 10 \u00b0C h \u22121 , a mixture of colorless block crystals 1 and colorless stick-like crystals 2 were obtained. The yield for 1 is 30% based on Zn. Complex 1 : elemental anal. calcd for C 18 H 16 N 7 O 9 Zn 1.5 : C 37.77, H 2.82, N 17.13; found: C 38.37, H 2.73, N 17.27. IR (KBr, cm \u22121 ): 3417(m), 3153(w), 3083(m), 1609(s), 1575(s), 1529(s), 1473(s), 1438(s), 1361(s), 1059(m), 763(m), 732(s), 634(m). Compound 2 : IR (KBr, cm \u22121 ): 3609(m), 3535(m), 3119(m), 1708(s), 1608(m), 1513(m), 1467(m), 1238(s), 1053(m), 803(m), 747(m), 679(m), 633(w). Both complexes can be prepared alone. A mixture of ZnSO 4 \u00b7 7H 2 O (0.3 mmol), H 3 btc (0.2 mmol), btp (0.2 mmol) and water (10 mL) heated at 160 \u00b0C for 3 days afforded complex 1 with 65% yield, while the mixture of H 3 btc (0.2 mmol), btp (0.2 mmol) and water (10 mL) heated at 160 \u00b0C for 3 days afforded compound 2 with 60% yield. The characteristic strong vibration absorptions of carboxyl groups appear at 1609, 1708 cm \u22121 for 1 and 2 , respectively, which indicates that the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid is deprotonated in 1 and protonated in 2 . X-ray structural analysis [11] revealed that complex 1 is a 3D metal\u2013organic network constructed through mixed ligands. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the asymmetric unit contains one and half crystallographically independent zinc(II) ions, a btp and a btc 3\u2212 ligand, as well as a coordinated water and two lattice water molecules. Zn(1) atom sits on two-fold rotation axis. It is in a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment and coordinates to two triazole nitrogen atoms and two carboxylate oxygen atoms belong to different btp and btc ligands. The bond distances of Zn(1)\u2013O(6) and Zn(1)\u2013N(6A) are 1.960(2), 2.044(2) \u00c5, respectively. Zn(2) atom is in a distorted trigonal\u2013pyramidal coordination environment and coordinates to a triazole N, a water O(1w) and two carboxylate O atoms. The basal plane is constructed by the coordination of N(1), O(2) and O(4A). The bond angles of N(1)\u2013Zn(2)\u2013O(2), N(1)\u2013Zn(2)\u2013O(4A) and O(2)\u2013Zn(2)\u2013O(4A) are 98.73(9), 124.09(10), 134.46(11)\u00b0, respectively. The water O(1w) occupies the axial position with Zn(2)\u2013O(1w) bond length of 2.044(2) \u00c5 and the bond angle of O(1w)\u2013Zn(2)\u2013O(2) 93.85(10)\u00b0. Other bond lengths and angles are normal as expected. Three carboxyl groups of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid are all deprotonated and coordinated to three Zn(II) atoms in a monodentate mode. 2,6-Bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine acts as a bidentate bridging ligand links two Zn(II) atoms through two triazole N atoms. Both multidentate ligands assembled with Zn(II) atoms forms a polymeric network. Interestingly, this network contains two kinds of molecular squares and a rectangle ( Fig. 1 b). One square is constructed by four bpt edges (1.14 nm \u00d7 1.14 nm), the other square is constructed by four btc edges (0.95 nm \u00d7 0.95 nm). A rectangle is formed by two bpt edges and two btc edges (1.14 nm \u00d7 0.95 nm) and held between four squares. Although polymeric network consisting of sole molecular square is common, the network containing different molecular squares is quite rare [13] . To our knowledge, complex 1 is the first coordination network containing two molecular squares and a rectangle. In complex 1 , 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate is a tridentate linker with a central triangular unit which is linked to three Zn(II) atoms [14] . The bidentate 2,6-bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine ligand can be simplified as a rod-like linker. Thus the polymeric network of 1 can be described clearly through a topologic structure ( Fig. 1 c). There are two square tunnels and a rectangular tunnel in this topologic structure. Further research found that three such networks interpenetrate to each other, leading to the formation of a dense 3D metal\u2013organic framework ( Fig. 1 d). Compound 2 is a 1:1 cocrystal of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid with 2,6-bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine. In Fig. 2 , the asymmetric unit contains H 3 btc, btp and water molecule. Bond lengths and angles are normal as expected [15] . Btp is twisted with a dihedral angle of 21.03\u00b0 between two triazole groups and pyridyl plane. Different with the structure of 1 , the carboxyl groups of H 3 btc are all protonated in cocrystal compound of 2 . Three carboxyl groups of H 3 btc link three triazole nitrogen atoms through strong O\u2014H\u22efN hydrogen bonds (donor to acceptor distances from 2.654(2) to 2.733(2) \u00c5). Water molecule connects two carboxyl oxygen atoms through weak O(7)\u2014H\u22efO hydrogen bonds (average 2.934 \u00c5). The sixth carboxyl oxygen shows weak H-bonding interaction with triazole C(6) atom (C(6)\u2014H\u22efO(5) 3.20 \u00c5). Through these intermolecular hydrogen bonds interactions, the organic molecules and water are assembled into a two-dimensional supramolecular network as shown in Fig. 2 . TG-DTA curves of 1 were measured from 20 to 800 \u00b0C in air ( Fig. 3 ). The lattice water and coordinated water molecules were released in the temperature range of 140\u2013190 \u00b0C (found 10.33%, calcd. 9.43%). Dehydrated [Zn 3 (btc) 2 (btp) 2 ] n framework kept thermal stable until 340 \u00b0C. Two weight-loss steps appeared in 340\u2013370 \u00b0C and 380\u2013500 \u00b0C ranges, which indicated a complicated process of 2,6-bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine released and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate decomposed. This process may lead to the formation of intermediate product Zn(HCO 3 ) 2 (found 46.36%, calcd. 49.11%) [16] . The last weight-loss step (530\u2013800 \u00b0C) corresponded to a decomposed process of Zn(HCO 3 ) 2 with the final residue ZnO left (found 26.73%, calcd. 21.33%). In conclusion, a novel metal\u2013organic network {[Zn 3 (btc) 2 (btp) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] \u00b7 4H 2 O} n ( 1 ) with a supramolecular cocrystal [H 3 btc \u00b7 btp \u00b7 H 2 O] n ( 2 ) have been prepared hydrothermally. Complex 1 exhibits unusual network containing two molecular squares and a rectangle. The result has proven that 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and 2,6-bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine are good molecular building blocks in constructing porous metal\u2013organic frameworks and supramolecular compounds.

        "abstract": "Hydrothermal reactions of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 with 2,6-bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine (btp) and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H 3 btc) or 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (H 4 btec) in base aqueous solution afford two novel complexes [Cu 2 (btp)(btc)(H 2 O)(OH)] n ( 1 ) and [Cu 2 (btp)(Hbtec)] n \u00b7 n H 2 O ( 2 ). Complex 1 is a coordination polymer where a carboxylate and a hydroxyl are bound to Cu(II) ions to form (\u03bc-OH)(\u03bc-O 2 CR)Cu 2 core, which is ferromagnetic couple with 2 J = 21.30 cm \u22121 . Complex 2 is a 3-D coordination polymer. Bond valence sum (BVS) analysis indicates it is a mixed-valence compound. Cu(I) is three-coordinated by triazole N-donors, while Cu(II) is four-coordinated by a triazole N and three carboxyl O-donors. Both complexes are quite thermal stable. Keywords Copper complex Crystal structure 2,6-Bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine 1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid 1,2,4,5-Benzenetetracarboxylic acid Mixed-valence Magnetism The molecular self-assembly, crystal structure and functional property of coordination polymers containing multidentate ligands are of considerable interest to inorganic and material chemists [1] . The diversity in the structure and topology of coordination polymers is attributed to the selection of metal centers and organic ligands as well as reaction pathways. Much effort has been focused on the design and controlled synthesis of copper complexes due to their attractive magnetic properties [2] , mixed-valence oxidation-state pairs [3] , luminescence and novel structural features. Polycarboxylate complexes have received considerable attention in recent decade. Numerous complexes with polycarboxylate ligands, such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate, have been prepared and structurally characterized [4] . Recently, 1,2,4-triazole and its derivatives are of increasing interest in constructing coordination polymers. 2,6-Bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine ( Scheme 1 ) possesses seven nitrogen atoms, which is a potential valuable N-heterocyclic ligand. Three btp complexes have been documented up to date [5\u20137] . In the course of our investigation for coordination polymers, a ferromagnetic copper complex and a mixed-valence copper complex were prepared unexpected by combining polycarboxylate and btp with copper ion. Herein, we report their synthesis, crystal structures and thermal stabilities as well as magnetic property of 1 . Ligand btp was synthesized according to the literature method [8] . Complex 1 was prepared by hydrothermal reaction of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 3H 2 O (0.3 mmol), btp (0.2 mmol), H 3 btc (0.2 mmol) and NaOH (0.6 mmol) in 8 mL water at 140 \u00b0C for 3 days, afforded blue rhombic crystals in 60% yield based on btp. Elemental anal. calcd for C 18 H 13 Cu 2 N 7 O 8 (%): C 37.13, H 2.23, N 16.83; found: C 37.40, H 2.29, N 16.59. IR (KBr, cm \u22121 ): 3515 m, 3093w, 1615 s, 1583 m, 1514 m, 1379 s, 1348 s, 1046 m, 724 m. Complex 2 was prepared by hydrothermal reaction of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 3H 2 O (0.2 mmol), btp (0.1 mmol), H 4 btec (0.1 mmol) and NaOH (0.4 mmol) in 8 mL water at 140 \u00b0C for 3 days, afforded green block crystals in 40% yield based on btp. Elemental anal. calcd for C 19 H 12 Cu 2 N 7 O 9 (%): C 37.41, H 1.98, N 16.08; found: C 36.30, H 1.93, N 15.20. IR (KBr, cm \u22121 ): 3445 m, 3130 w, 1698 m, 1608 s, 1529 m, 1467 m, 1387 s, 1262 m, 1062 m, 634 m. X-ray structural analysis [9] revealed the complex 1 is a 3-D coordination polymer. As shown in Fig. 1 , the asymmetric unit contains two independent Cu(II) ions, btp ligand, btc 3\u2212 anion, OH \u2212 group and a coordinated H 2 O. Btp acts as a bidentate bridging ligand binds to Cu(II) ions using two triazole N-terminals with average Cu\u2013N bond length of 2.006 \u00c5. Other triazole N atoms and the pyridyl N atom are free. H 3 btc is completely deprotonated and acts as a tetradentate ligand bound to three Cu(II) ions. The Cu\u2013O bond lengths vary from 1.917(2) to 1.971(2) \u00c5. Cu(1) is five-coordinated, with a square\u2013pyramidal geometry. The basal position is occupied by triazole N(1), hydroxyl O(1H), carboxyl O(1) and O(6A) with bond angle N(1)\u2013Cu(1)\u2013O(6A) 171.01(11)\u00b0 and O(1)\u2013Cu(1)\u2013O(1H) 159.08(10)\u00b0. In the apical position, water molecule O(2W) is coordinated to Cu(1) with a distance of 2.514 \u00c5. Hydroxyl O(1H) is tridentate. It bridges Cu(1) and Cu(2A) with bond lengths 1.917(2) and 1.934(2) \u00c5, while coordinates weakly to Cu(2) with a distance 2.411(2) \u00c5. Therefore Cu(2) is also square-pyramidal five-coordinated. The basal position is occupied by N(6A), O(3A), O(5B) and O(1HA) with N(6A)\u2013Cu(2)\u2013O(5B) 173.97(10)\u00b0 and O(1HA)\u2013Cu(2)\u2013O(3A) 176.4(1)\u00b0. The apical position is occupied by O(1H) with a distance of 2.411(2) \u00c5. Amongst three carboxylate groups of btc 3\u2212 , two carboxylates are monodentate and coordinate to Cu(1), Cu(2). A bidentate carboxylate and a OH \u2212 group are bound to Cu(1) and Cu(2A) to form a triply bridged dicopper unit (\u03bc-OH)(\u03bc-O 2 CR)Cu 2 with a Cu(1)\u22efCu(2A) separation of 3.2170(7) \u00c5. The bond angle Cu(1)\u2013O(1H)\u2013Cu(2A) is 113.31(12)\u00b0. Two (\u03bc-OH)(\u03bc-O 2 CR)Cu 2 units are connected together by weak Cu(2)\u2013O(1H) bond to form a tetranuclear structure with butterfly. Such Cu 4 aggregates are further linked by btp and btc 3\u2212 to form a 3-D polymeric framework. In addition, there exist some hydrogen-bonding interactions involving H 2 O, OH \u2212 with N(2), N(7), O(4) and O(5) atoms. Complex 2 is a 3-D coordination polymer. The asymmetric unit consists of two independent copper ions, Hbtec 3\u2212 anion, dtp ligand and a lattice H 2 O. As shown in Fig. 2 , Cu(1) is in a square four-coordinated environment and surrounded by triazole N(1) and three carboxyl O-donors from different Hbtec 3\u2212 . Cu(1)\u2013N(1) bond length is 2.003(3) \u00c5, and average Cu(1)\u2013O bond length is 1.933 \u00c5. Cu(2) is in a trigonal geometry surrounded by three triazole N-donors from three btp ligands. Average Cu(2)\u2013N bond length is 2.003 \u00c5. Interestingly, the complex is a Cu I /Cu II mixed-valence compound, although Cu II salt was used in the preparation reaction. Using the bond valence sum (BVS) analysis method [11] , we calculate the BVS value of Cu(1), which is 1.90 and consistent with a Cu 2+ oxidation state. The BVS value of Cu(2) is 1.00, which is exactly consistent with a Cu + oxidation state [12] . Although complex 2 contains Cu(I) ions, however it is quite stable in air. Unlike the structure of 1 , btp ligand is tetradentate in 2 , which coordinates to three Cu(I) and a Cu(II) through four triazole N-donors. The pyridyl plane has a dihedral angle of 22.36\u00b0 with the triazole N(6)N(7)C(19)N(5)C(18) plane, while has a dihedral angle of 9.02\u00b0 with another triazole plane. H 4 btec is partially deprotonated and formed a Hbtec 3\u2212 anion, which coordinates to three Cu(II) through three monodentate carboxylate groups. The carboxyl O(4) has H-bonding interaction with lattice water. Through Btp and Hbtec 3\u2212 multidentate bridging ligands, Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions are connected to form a 3-D metal-organic framework as shown in packing diagram. The thermogravimetric analysis measurements of 1 , 2 were performed in the temperature range of 20\u2013800 \u00b0C in air. Complex 1 was a little efflorescent and lost lattice water slowly when the crystal sample kept at room temperature. The resulting powder sample of 1 was heated to 280 \u00b0C without weight change. A rapid weight-loss step occurred in the range 280\u2013330 \u00b0C with a strong exothermic peak at 296.1 \u00b0C, indicated a mixed process of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate decomposed and bridging OH \u2212 groups dehydrated. This process might lead to an intermediate product [Cu 2 O(btp)(CO 3 )] (found 70.29%; calcd 73.76%) [13,14] . The intermediate decomposed further to form CuO residue at 800 \u00b0C (found 30.82%; calcd 28.19%). Complex 2 lost lattice water near 140 \u00b0C (found 1.14%; calcd 2.95%). The Hbtec 3\u2212 ligand decomposed rapidly in the range 280\u2013310 \u00b0C (found 23.19%; calcd 21.51%), which might lead to the formation of intermediate product [Cu 2 (btp)(CO 3 ) 2 ] (found 75.67%; calcd 75.52%). The intermediate decomposed further to form CuO residue at high temperature. The magnetic susceptibilities of complex 1 were measured in the range 4\u2013310 K on a Quantum Design PPMS-9 magnetometer at a magnetic field of 5000 Oe. Diamagnetic correction was made with Pascal\u2019s constants. The variation of \u03c7 M and \u03c7 M T versus T for dicopper unit is plotted in Fig. 3 . By lowering the temperature from 310 to 4 K, the \u03c7 M T value increased continuously from 1.11 to 1.52 cm 3 K mol \u22121 . This result indicates the presence of ferromagnetic interaction between Cu(II) ions. Considering the dicopper cores isolated by larger dtp and btc 3\u2212 ligands, the appropriate magnetic exchange pathway in (\u03bc-OH)(\u03bc-O 2 CR)Cu 2 core is through the hydroxyl and bidentate carboxylate bridges. Due to the magnetic couple is located at dicopper unit. Bleaney\u2013Bowers expression based on spin Hamiltonian ( H = \u22122 J S 1 \u00b7 S 2 ) is employed to evaluated the magnetic exchange constant by fitting the magnetic susceptibility data [15] . This gives the singlet-triplet energy separation value 2 J = 21.30 cm \u22121 , g = 2.43, and an agreement factor R of 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Most of carboxylato-bridging dinuclear Cu(II) complexes are antiferromagnetic couple, while the magnetic interactions of hydroxyl-bridging dicopper complexes strongly depend on the Cu\u2013O\u2013Cu angles [16] . A series of triply bridged dicopper(II) complexes containing carboxylate and hydroxyl bridges exhibit ferromagnetic couples where Cu(II) ions are square-pyramidal coordination and the Cu\u2013O(H)\u2013Cu angles are from 101 to 107\u00b0 [17] . In complex 1 , the Cu\u2013O(H)\u2013Cu angle is 113.31(12)\u00b0, which shows a ferromagnetic interaction. The hydroxyl plays an important role in propagating magnetic exchange interaction between the Cu(II) ions. This phenomenon were also observed in several (\u03bc-OH)(\u03bc-O 2 CR)Cu 2 cores where the magnetic interactions primarily depend upon the Cu\u2013O\u2013Cu angle [18,19] . The complex 2 contains non-magnetic Cu(I) ion and paramagnetic Cu(II) ion which are isolated by large 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate ligand. Its magnetic interaction should be weak and has not been further investigated. In conclusion, two novel copper coordination polymers have been assembled by polycarboxylate and 2,6-bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine ligands. They present interesting structures and properties, one is a ferromagnetic Cu II complex, and the other one is a Cu I /Cu II mixed-valence complex.

The one-pot four-component process consists of an initial Michael addition, and a subsequent intramolecular cyclization. The effect of solvents on the reaction efficiency and yield is briefly investigated. The structure of product is further confirmed by XRD analysis. Meanwhile, the further transformation of hemi-aminal moiety to the corresponding dehydrated product is also achieved under the mild reaction conditions. The possible mechanism for the formation of product is presented.",

        "abstract": "Solvothermal reactions of CuSCN with 4-amine-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,2,4- triazole (3-Abpt), 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole (4-Ptz), and 2-(n-pyridyl) benzimidazole (n-PyHBIm, n = 4, 3, 2) in acetonitrile afford six novel coordination polymers: [Cu5(SCN)5(3-Abpt) 2]n (1), [Cu(SCN)(3-Abpt)]n (2), [Cu(SCN)(4-Ptz)]n (3), [Cu2(SCN)2(4-PyHBIm)] n (4), [Cu2(SCN)2(3-PyHBIm)]n (5), and [Cu2(SCN)2(2-PyBIm)(2-PyHBIm)]n (6). All these complexes were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. 1 is the first example of a 1,1,1,3-\u03bc4-tetradentate thiocyanate complex which displays a three-dimensional (3D) polymeric framework constructed from thiocyanate and tetradentate 3-Abpt. 2 exhibits a two-dimensional (2D) 4.82 network constructed from unidentate thiocyanate and tridentate 3-Abpt. 3 is a one-dimensional (1D) ladder-like double-chain polymer assembled by bidentate thiocyanate and 4-Ptz ligands. 4 shows a 2D 1,1,3-\u03bc3- thiocyanate copper 4.82 network where bidentate 4-PyHBIm locates at both sides of the 2D layer. 5 displays a 2D 63 network constructing from 1,3-\u03bc3-thiocyanate and bidentate 3-PyHBIm. 6 is a ID 2 1 helical chain polymer constructing from 1,3-\u03bc2- thiocyanate and 2-PyBIm anion. Bond valence sum (BVS) analysis and magnetic susceptibility indicate that 6 is a mixed-valence compound. The coordinate diversity of thiocyanate is discussed. 1-6 are all thermally stable up to 230-290 \u00b0C. They exhibit yellow or blue luminescence originating from ligandto-metal charge transfer or ligand-centered emission. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

Three novel coordination polymers {[Zn2(\u03b76-ao2btc)(\u03b72-2, 2\u2032-bpy)2(H2O)2]\u00b72H 2O}1 n (1), {[Zn2(\u03b78- aobtc)(\u03b72-phen)(H2O)]\u00b7DMF}3 n (2), and {(Hap)2[Zn3(\u03b79-aobtc) 2]\u00b72H2O}3 n (3) (2,2\u2032-bpy = 2,2\u2032-bipyridine, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, ap = 4-aminopyridine, ao2btc4- and aobtc4- are two oxidized forms of H4abtc ligand) were prepared under hydrothermal conditions. The structures of 1-3 were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 is a 1D chain polymer, while 2 and 3 are porous 3D metal-organic frameworks with a cavity size of 9 \u00c5 diameter and 7 \u00d7 15 \u00c5 rectangular cavities, respectively. In 1, ao2btc 4- links four mononuclear ZnO6 chromophores. Ligand aobtc4- in 2 links four dinuclear Zn2(CO2) 4(H2O)N2, while aobtc4- in 3 bridges four trinuclear Zn3(CO2)8. From a topology point of view, ao2btc4- or aobtc4- are all 4-connected linkers in 1-3, while the mononuclear ZnO6 in 1, dinuclear Zn2(CO2)4(H2O)N 2 in 2 and trinuclear Zn3(CO2)8 in 3 are 2, 4 and 8 connected nodes, respectively. Zn(ii) in complex 2 can be replaced by Cu(ii), Ni(ii) and Co(ii) with simultaneous loss of crystallinity. The metal ion exchange rate decrease in the order Co(ii) < Ni(ii) < Cu(ii). 2 can encapsulate iodine (I2) in cyclohexane solution to form 2\u22830.1I2. The encapsulated I2 can be released completely in ethanol. The Hap+ in 3 can be replaced by methylene blue in aqueous solution to form 3\u22830.1methylene blue. The insignificant replacement is an indication that the guest molecule in the cavity channel is immobile, which prevents further substitution. With a bis-oxo group in the azo moiety, the framework of 1 is so unstable that it will decompose at \u223c150 \u00b0C with simultaneous release of NO. Complexes 2 and 3 are stable at 330 \u00b0C. IR and fluorescence spectra were also discussed. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

These complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectra, luminescent spectra, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and single crystal structure. Complex 1 adopted a straight Zn 4(\u03bc 4-O) linked by TATB 3- subunit to form an adamantane structure with a fully empty tetrahedral cavity. Two naked protons floated in the complex. This structure supports the existence of naked protons in nature. In complexes 2-3, the six deprotonated carboxylic oxygen of TATB 3- coordinated to eight metal ions to form a 3D close-packed structure. Its density of 1.837 mg m -3 made complex 2 one of the most closely packed structure based on H 3TATB ever determined. Coordination polyhedral linked each other to form a diamondoid metal-oxygen framework in 2 and 3. All the coordination polymers were thermally stable up to 470\u00b0C. These were the most thermally stable coordination polymers. A high-resolution transmission electron microscope indicated that the metal oxide is porous with pore diameters of \u223c 2 nm. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The reaction of 4,4\u2032-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)biphenyl (btmb) with silver(I) salts of BF 4 -, NO 3 - and N 3 - led to the formation of four new silver(I) coordination polymers {[Ag(btmb)]BF 4} n (1), {[Ag 2(btmb) 3](NO 3) 2(H 2O) 5} n (2), [Ag 2(btmb)(N 3) 2] n (3), and [Ag(btmb)(N 3)] n (4). Their coordination number varies from 2 (in 1) to 3 (in 2), 4 (in 3), and 5 (in 4). Different from the single chain structure of 1, complex 2 displays a 1D ladder-like double chain framework, whereas complex 3 exhibits a 2D layered architecture. Complex 4 has the same anion as complex 3 but shows a different metal-to-ligand ratio and a 1D double-zigzag chain structure. Both 3 and 4 have Ag\u22efAg argentophilic interactions. The ligand btmb adopts both cis or trans configuration in the studied complexes. A trans- or cis-btmb ligand link silver ions with Ag\u22efAg distances of \u224818 and 13 \u00c5, respectively. BF 4 - and NO 3 - are non-coordinating anions in 1 and 2. N 3 - is the bridging anion in 3 (1,3-bridging fashion) and 4 (1,1-bridging fashion). These findings suggest that the coordination numbers around the Ag I ion correlate to the coordination abilities of anions and the btmb to silver ratio. In addition, the influence of anions on thermal stability were also investigated. This work is a good example that nicely supports the less explored field of anion-dependent structures of complexes with non-pyridyl ligands. \u00a9 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",

In complex 1 , both Cu(II) ions are five-coordinated with square-pyramidal geometry and water molecules occupy the apical position. The Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distance is 5.344(7) \u00c5. Complex 2 adopts the same coordination geometry as that in 1 . The Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distance is 7.812(5) \u00c5. Complex 1 exhibits hydroxylation of the xylyl linker of the supporting ligand in the presence of H 2 O 2 in aqueous solution. No observable reaction took place under the identical conditions for complex 2 . Proximity effect of the metal center is responsible for the hydroxylation. Keywords Copper Polycarboxylate Imidazole H 2 O 2 Hydroxylation Supramolecular chemistry based on transition metals and multifunctional organic ligands currently have received considerable interests owing to their novel structural topologies and potential applications in host\u2013guest chemistry, catalysis and magnetic materials [1] . Apart from the fundamental metal\u2013ligand coordination covalent bond, the hydrogen bond is the most familiar organizing force in supramolecular assembly due to its moderately directional intermolecular interaction that may control short-range packing [2] . Multidentate carboxylate ligands can act as hydrogen-bond acceptors and hydrogen-bond donors, which make them good candidates to construct supramolecular networks. Although a number of supramolecular complexes have been obtained via self-assembly of the metal ions and rigid aromatic polycarboxylate ligands such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid [3\u20134] . The investigation on supramolecular frameworks constructed from the flexible polycarboxylate ligands containing aromatic ring are rare and the effect of geometry of the ligands on the structure and reactivity remains unexplored. Keeping in mind the aforementioned points, two new flexible polycarboxylate ligands were designed and synthesized ( Scheme 1 ), in which the m -xylene and p -xylene were utilized to link two flexible iminodiacetic groups. On the other hand, dioxygen activation is a very hot topic in current chemistry research [5] . Dinuclear copper complexes are often served as bioinorganic model compounds to mimic metalloprotein such as hemocyanin and tyrosinase that activate dioxygen. For instance, Karlin and co-works have first demonstrated that the copper(I) complex, [Cu 2 ( m -XYLpy 2 )](PF 6 ) 2 ( m -XYLpy 2 = N , N , N \u2032, N \u2032-tetra-(2-pyridylethyl)- m -xylylene diamine) is capable of performing hydroxylation of the xylyl linkers of the supporting ligands in the presence of dioxygen [6] . Imidazole group also plays important roles in biological systems and copper\u2013imidazole bonding is widely known in biological systems [7] . Otherwise, copper(II) complexes with imidazole ligands have recently also been reported to achieve highly ordered supramolecular assemblies [8\u20139] . Thus, in this work, two dinuclear copper(II) complexes, [Cu 2 L1(imH) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] \u00b7 4H 2 O ( 1 ) and [Cu 2 L2(imH) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] \u00b7 2H 2 O ( 2 ) (L1H 4 = N , N , N \u2032, N \u2032- m -xylylenediamine tetraacetic acid, L2H 4 = N , N , N \u2032, N \u2032- p -xylylenediamine tetraacetic acid, imH = imidazole) have been prepared and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, IR, element analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The reaction of copper(II) complexes with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) have also been studied by UV\u2013vis spectra. The flexible chelating ligands L1H 4 and L2H 4 were prepared following a reported procedure for synthesizing 1,3,5-benzenemethyltriiminodiacetic acid [10,11] . Complexes 1 and 2 were achieved by reaction of the ligand L1H 4 or L2H 4 and imidazole with copper nitrate hexahydrate in the molar ratio of 1:2:2 in aqueous solution, respectively [12] . The detailed description of the IR spectra and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results of 1 and 2 see the supporting information . Due to the presence of methylene groups between the central benzene ring and terminal iminodiacetic group in L1H 4 and L2H 4 , there can be two conformations when they coordinate with metal ions, namely, cis , cis -conformation ( V -form) and trans , trans -conformation ( Z -form) ( Chart S1 ). Crystallographic analysis reveals that the two iminodiacetate groups in complex 1 and 2 are all in opposite directions to the central benzene ring ( Fig. 1 ). Therefore, the conformations of the resulting complex 1 and 2 are in Z -form. Complex 1 crystallizes in space group P \u22121 and there is a neutral dinuclear copper(II) complex and four guest water molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit [13] . As shown in Fig. 1 a, each Cu(II) ion in 1 has a N 2 O 3 coordination environment that can be described as distorted square-pyramidal geometry (type 4 + 1, \u03c4 = 0.05) according to the Addison\u2013Reedijk geometric criterion [14] . The basal plane defined by one nitrogen atom from imidazole and one nitrogen atom and two oxygen atoms from iminodiacetate group. The Cu\u2013O distance range from 1.950(3) to 1.966(3) \u00c5. Bond lengths of Cu\u2013N(imidazole) and Cu\u2013N(iminodiacetate) are 1.950(3) and 2.009(3) \u00c5, respectively. These bond lengths are comparable to those reported values [15] . Water molecules occupied the apical position with a longer distances of 2.319 \u00c5 (Cu1\u2013O1W) and 2.334 \u00c5 (Cu2\u2013O2W). The Cu1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu2 separation is 5.344 \u00c5. Each iminodiacetate group coordinates to Cu1 or Cu2 ion in mer -NO2 tridentate chelating mode, which led to the formation of two five-member rings of CuNC 2 O with a dihedral angle of 14\u00b0 for Cu1 and 15\u00b0 for Cu2. The two imidazolyl rings are on the opposite side of the benzene plane and inclined to the phenyl ring at angles of 61.4\u00b0 for Cu1 and 60.3\u00b0 for Cu2, while the dihedral angle of the two imidazole plane is 73.5\u00b0, which indicates that they fall nearly perpendicular to each other. Complex 2 crystallizes in space group P 2(1)/ n and features a dinuclear single-stranded helical arrangement ( Fig. 1 b) similar to the pentanuclear helicate reported by Pan et al. [16] , which possesses an inversion center with only half of the atoms being crystallographically independent. The Cu(II) center in 2 has the same N 2 O 3 coordination environment with that in 1 described as slightly distorted square-pyramidal ( \u03c4 = 0.08) geometry. Accordingly, the iminodiacetate group gives two nearly coplanar five-membered chelated ring of CuNC 2 O with a dihedral angle of 13.5\u00b0, and the Cu\u2013N(imidazole) distance is 1.952(2) \u00c5 and Cu\u2013N(iminodiacetate group) distance is 2.009(2) \u00c5, which also agreed well with the reported values [15] . The other bond lengths are slightly different from complex 1 , particularly the distance of Cu1\u2013O1 and Cu1\u2013O3 bond in basal plane are 1.972(2) \u00c5 and 1.979(2) \u00c5, which are longer than that of 1 , while the apical Cu1\u2013O1W bond has a shorter distance with 2.259 \u00c5 compared to 2.319 or 2.334 \u00c5 in 1 . The Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distance in 2 is 7.812 \u00c5, which is much longer than that in 1 . Again, the two imidazolyl rings in 2 are on the opposite side of the benzene plane, but different from 1 , the two imidazole planes are not only parallel to each other but also almost parallel to the phenyl ring with the dihedral angle of 16.9\u00b0. Analysis of the crystal packing of the complex 1 shows that the basic building units [Cu 2 L1(imH) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] are connected into a one-dimensional tube-like polymeric chain running parallel to the a direction by the weak C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen-bond interactions [17] (C10\u2013H10\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O6, C21\u2013H21\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O8) ( Fig S1a ). One-dimensional tube-like chains are further linked into a three-dimensional structure through the O(W)\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen-bonding interactions in b direction and the N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen-bonding interactions in c direction ( Fig. S2 ). Complex 2 stacked into a one-dimensional helical structure by the N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen-bonding interactions ( Fig. S1b ), and the one-dimensional helical chains further assembly into 2D layer supramolecular framework through O(W)\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen-bonding interactions ( Fig. S3 ). A structural comparison of compound 1 and 2 suggests that the delicate difference of the geometry of ligands L1H 4 and L2H 4 can led to remarkable differences in the crystal packing of their copper(II) complexes. It is reported that the diiron(III) complex of L1 4\u2212 could hydroxylate the xylyl linker in the presence of H 2 O 2 [18] . Whether copper(II) complex of this ligand can do the same work is not clear. Some other copper(I) complexes with similar structure (pyridine or pyrazole instead of carboxylate) can activate dioxygen and hydrolylate the supporting ligands in organic solvents [6,19] , which stimulated us to investigate the reactions of complex 1 and 2 with H 2 O 2 by UV\u2013vis spectra. As can be seen from Fig. 2 , the electronic absorption spectra of complex 1 and 2 are very similar due to the fact that they have almost the same chromophores, both exhibit a weak absorption feature at \u223c650 nm ( \u03b5 < 100) which was attributed to the d \u2013 d transition of the copper(II) center. Addition of 80 equiv of H 2 O 2 into the blue aqueous solution of complex 1 at room temperature resulted in a rapid color change from blue to yellow. Meanwhile, a new absorption band appeared at \u223c380 nm ( \u03b5 = 2500) and the reaction quickly proceeds and no detectable intermediate is observed at present stage. Although all attempts to crystallize this oxidized species was in vain so far, we can assign that the oxidized product is the hydroxylation of the xylyl linker in L1 4\u2212 by complex 1 /H 2 O 2 system ( Scheme 2 ) similar to its iron(II) complex [19] according to the similarity of 380 nm absorption to that of the phenol\u2013copper(II) complex in both wavelength and absorption coefficient [20] . Additionally, the negative ion ESI-TOF/MS spectrum of the aqueous solution of 1 by addition of 80 equiv H 2 O 2 show a signal at m /z 641.0 attributable to the hydroxylated specie [Cu 2 (L1\u2013O)(imH) 2 ] \u2212 , and its isotopic distribution patterns are almost identical to the corresponding simulated ones given by Isopro 3.0 ( Fig. S4) . Contrarily, there was no observable electronic spectral change for complex 2 under the same conditions. The significant difference of the reaction with H 2 O 2 by complex 1 and 2 can be explained from their crystal structures. In complex 1 , the distances of the Cu1 and Cu2 ions and the hydroxylated carbon atom (C2) of the xylyl linker in L1 are 3.070(6) and 3.114(5) \u00c5, respectively, and the distance of dicopper core and the C2 atom is 1.557 \u00c5. These distances are close to ensure hydroxylation take place. However the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distance in complex 2 is 7.812 \u00c5 and the central benzene ring of L2 4\u2212 lies in the center of the two copper centers, which disfavor the formation of a reactive oxygen intermediate for the hydroxylation. Thus, the selective hydroxylation occurred at the 2-position of the xylyl linker in ligand appears to be mostly due to the proximity effect of the metal center ( meta - or para -position). In summary, we have designed and synthesized two new flexible dinuclear copper complexes in which the two coordination metal centers situate the meta - or para -position, respectively. The copper(II) ions in both complexes adopt a distort square-pyramidal geometry. The X-ray structural analysis clearly show that the delicate difference of the geometry of ligands can led to remarkable differences in the crystal packing of their copper(II) complexes. The present study offers important insights into geometric effects of ligands on the structure of supramolecular networks. Additionally, complex 1 may hydroxylate the xylyl linker in the ligand by reaction with H 2 O 2 while no ligand hydroxylation take place for complex 2 , and the proximity effect of the metal center seems to be responsible for the hydroxylation.

        "abstract": "Reactions of metal acetates with 4-amino-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (3-abpt) and co-ligands gave rise to four new complexes, namely [Zn 2 (3-abpt)(beta)(DMF) (H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b7 n H 2 O ( 1 ), [Zn(3-abpt)(ip)] n \u00b73 n H 2 O ( 2 ), [Zn(3-abpt)(ip)(H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b72 n H 2 O ( 3 ), and [Cu 2 (3-abpt) 2 (C 6 H 5 COO) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b72 n H 2 O ( 4 ) (ip = isophthalate, beta = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate). Compound 1 is a 3D coordination polymer with uncommon 3,4-connected (6 2 .8) 2 (6 2 .8 2 .10 2 ) network. Compounds 2 \u2013 4 are all 1D coordination polymers, which exhibit diversity structures. Compound 2 is a tubular-like chain, 3 is a ring-like network, and 4 is a zigzag chain. Their thermal stabilities and the photoluminescence of 1 have also been investigated. Keywords 4-Amino-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole Coordination polymer Crystal structure Thermal analysis 1 Introduction Considerable attention has been paid to the study of metal coordination polymers because of their intriguing structural architectures and potential applications as functional materials [1\u20136] . However, it is still a challenging task to explore successful synthetic strategies for the preparation of coordination polymers with predictable structures and applications. Their preparations are highly influenced by reaction conditions such as pH value, solvent system, and temperature [7,8] . N-heterocyclic and polycarboxylate species have been extensively explored to obtain a series of materials due to their rich coordination mode. Currently, triazole ligands and their derivatives, known for their versatile coordination ability and wide applications as multidentate bridging ligands, are of considerable interest in constructing coordination polymers [9\u201313] . 4-Amino-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (3-abpt), an angular bridging ligand, can serve as a good candidate for the construction of molecular cages, rings, grids, and ladders [14\u201326] . While polycarboxylic acids also present a high structural effect in assembling coordination polymers due to their diverse binding modes [27\u201331] . On the other hand, with the aid of special intermolecular contacts, hydrogen bonding, and aromatic stacking force might play important roles in molecular recognition and assembly [32,33] . To illustrate these effects on the construction of supramolecular assembly, in the contribution, we will present four new complexes, namely [Zn 2 (3-abpt)(beta)(DMF)(H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b7 n H 2 O ( 1 ), [Zn(3-abpt)(ip)] n \u00b73 n H 2 O ( 2 ), [Zn(3-abpt)(ip)(H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b72 n H 2 O ( 3 ), and [Cu 2 (3-abpt) 2 (C 6 H 5 COO) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b72 n H 2 O ( 4 ) (ip = isophthalate, beta = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate). We can find their structural discrepancy is dependent on many factors, such as subtle interplay of metal coordination preferences, ligand type, spatial extension, and steric constraints. Besides, hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking force also play important roles in the formation of these polymeric materials. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods The ligand 4-amino-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole was prepared according to the literature method [34] . Other chemicals were of reagent grade and used as purchased without further purification. Elemental analyses (EA) were performed on a Vario EL III analyzer. Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded with a Nicolet A370 FT-IR spectrometer by KBr pellets in the range 400\u20134000 cm \u22121 . Thermogravimetric analyses (TG-DSC) were completed on a Netzsch STA 449C thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min in air. The fluorescent data were collected on an Edinburgh FL-FS920 TCSPC system. 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 [Zn 2 (3-abpt)(beta)(DMF)(H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b7 n H 2 O ( 1 ) An aqueous (5 mL) solution of Zn(OAc) 2 \u00b72H 2 O (0.024 g, 0.11 mmol) was mixed with a solution of 3-abpt (0.024 g, 0.10 mmol) in methanol (10 mL) with stirring.

Empirical absorption corrections were applied using sadabs program. The structures were solved by direct methods with shelxs -97 program and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F 2 with shelxl -97 program [35] . All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were located and included at their calculated positions. The crystal data and structure refinement results are summarized in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2 . 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Structural description of [Zn 2 (3-abpt)(beta)(DMF)(H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b7 n H 2 O ( 1 ) Compound 1 is a three-dimensional (3D) coordination polymer based on 3-abpt and H 4 beta. There are two independent Zn(II) ions in the asymmetric unit. As shown in Fig. S1 , Zn1 center is octahedrally coordinated by one pyridyl nitrogen donor of 3-abpt and three oxygen atoms from one chelating and one monodentate carboxylate groups in the equatorial plane, and two oxygen atoms from coordinated water molecules at the axis positions with O1\u2013Zn1\u2013O2 angle of 171.8(2)\u00b0. With respect to Zn2, the distorted tetrahedral sphere is provided by one pyridyl nitrogen from 3-abpt, two oxygen atoms from different beta 4\u2212 anions in monodentate mode, and one oxygen donor from DMF molecule. The beta ligand acts as a \u03bc 4 -bridge to link four metal ions, but present different coordination modes with Zn1 and Zn2 centers. The carboxylate groups in opposite position from beta 4\u2212 ligands adopt chelate and monodentate bridging modes to link Zn1 centers to form a 2D layer with Zn1 \u22ef Zn1 distance of 6.084 and 9.259 \u00c5 ( Fig. S2a ), while only adopt monodentate bridging mode as tetradentate ligand to link Zn2 centers to form the same 2D (4,4) network with Zn2 \u22ef Zn2 distance of 5.853 and 9.339 \u00c5 ( Fig. S2b ). In 1 , 3-abpt ligand acts as bidentate ligand in cis -fashion bridging Zn1 and Zn2 atoms ( Scheme S1 ). As shown in Fig. 1 a, the beta-Zn1 and beta-Zn2 layers are further connected by 3-abpt ligand to generate a 3D structure. Exclude the solvent molecule, a computation of voids by using the platon program [36] suggests a value of 223.6 \u00c5 3 , corresponding to 7.8% of the unit-cell volume. In addition, some intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds including O1\u2013H1B \u22ef N3 (\u2212 x + 1, \u2212 y + 2, \u2212 z + 1), O1\u2013H1C \u22ef O6 ( x , \u2212 y + 5/2, z + 1/2), O2\u2013H2B \u22ef O4, O2\u2013H2B \u22ef O3, O1W\u2013H1WA \u22ef O3 (\u2212 x + 1, y + 1/2, \u2212 z + 1/2), O1W\u2013H1WB \u22ef N2 ( x , \u2212 y + 5/2, z \u2212 1/2), and some aromatic stacking interactions further stabilize its structure. Within the framework, the pyridyl ring N6 \u223c C5 of 3-abpt ligand is parallel to the phenyl ring C14 \u223c C16a of beta at ( x , 1/2 + y , 1/2 \u2212 z ), and the perpendicular distance between the two ring planes is 3.171(2) \u00c5, with the distance between ring centroids is 3.818(3) \u00c5. From the viewpoint of network topology, the complex 1 can be simplified as a 3,4 two-nodal net as shown in Fig. 1 b. The beta ligands can be treated as a 4-connected node, then, the Zn1 and Zn2 centers become 3-connected node. The Schafli symbol for this 3,4-connected uniform network is (6 2 .8) 2 (6 2 .8 2 .10 2 ) [37] , while the long vertex symbol is [6.6.8 2 ] [6.6.8.8.10 2 .10 2 ]. Comparing with reported 3,4-connected examples [38] , we find two cases that contain 6 2 .8 net, namely hst and tfi nets. However, hst and tfi nets are characterized by six- and eight-membered rings whereas the present one features six-, eight-, and ten-membered rings. Then, it is clear that the present case is different from the reported cases and presents a new type of 3,4-connected topology, but has been theoretically known as a derived net from the 4,4-connected bbf net by following the approach described by Blatov [39] . 3.2 Structural description of [Zn(3-abpt)(ip)] n \u00b73 n H 2 O ( 2 ) Compound 2 is a 1D tubular-like chain structure, in which Zn(II) centers are interlinked by ip 2\u2212 and 3-abpt ligands. Each Zn(II) atom is in a disordered tetrahedral coordination environment, surrounded by two pyridyl nitrogen atoms from different 3-abpt ligands and two oxygen atoms from monodentate bridging carboxylate groups of two ip ligands. The zinc atom is also weakly coordinated by the additional oxygen atoms of the carboxylate groups (drawn as fragmented bonds in Fig. S3 ). They are 2.561(3) \u00c5 from the zinc atom, which is significantly less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of 2.91 \u00c5 [40] . Two 3-abpt ligands take the cis -fashion to connect two Zn(II) atoms to get a {Zn 2 (3-abpt) 2 } bimetallic ring with a Zn \u22ef Zn distances of 10.347(2) \u00c5. These units are further linked by ip bridge to afford a tubular-like chain ( Fig. 2 a), in which Zn \u22ef Zn separation by ip ligands is 10.152(3) \u00c5. In addition, the hydrogen bonds like O3W\u2013H3C \u22ef N2 (3\u2212 x , \u22121 \u2212 y , 1 \u2212 z ) between 1D tubular-like chains and some aromatic stacking interactions further connect these chains into a 3D network. There exists the interchain \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction between two phenyl rings of ip, with perpendicular and centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.554(2) \u00c5 and 3.889(4) \u00c5, as shown in Fig. 2 b. 3.3 Structural description of [Zn(3-abpt)(ip)(H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b72 n H 2 O ( 3 ) Compound 3 features a 1D ring-like infinite chain coordination structure in which Zn(II) centers are interlinked by ip and 3-abpt bridges. As shown in Fig. S4 , each Zn(II) atom is surrounded by two oxygen donors from different ip, two pyridyl nitrogen atoms from a pair of 3-abpt in cis -arrangement, and two oxygen atoms from coordinated water molecules to display a octahedral coordination geometry. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the Zn(II) centers are bridged by ip and 3-abpt ligands to yield a 1D ring-like chain with Zn \u22ef Zn separation of 9.8539(9) \u00c5. The dihedral angle between the C(1) \u223c N(1) and C(8) \u223c N(6) planes in 3-abpt ligand is 29.74(1)\u00b0, showing some distortion. These polymeric chains are further linked through interchain O6\u2013H6A \u22ef O4 (\u2212 x + 2, \u2212 y + 1, \u2212 z + 1) and O5\u2013H5C \u22ef O4 (\u2212 x + 3/2, y \u2212 1/2, \u2212 z + 1/2) interactions to form 2D layer. Furthermore, these layers connect by hydrogen bonds between lattice water molecules and carboxylate groups to generate a 3D architecture ( Fig. 3 b). 3.4 Structural description of [Cu 2 (3-abpt) 2 (C 6 H 5 COO) 4 (HO 2 ) 2 ] n \u00b72 n H 2 O ( 4 ) Compound 4 shows 1D zigzag chain structure. As shown in Fig. S5 , Cu1 shows a disordered octahedral sphere, coordinated by two pyridyl nitrogen atoms from different 3-abpt ligands, four carboxylate oxygen donors from two benzoic acids in chelate coordination mode. It should be pointed out that the distance of Cu1\u2013O2 (2.566(2) \u00c5) is longer than Cu1\u2013O1 (1.957(2) \u00c5). So we can conclude that the latter one have stronger coordination ability with Cu than the former one. Besides, weak coordination nature could be assigned to the former bond [41] . Cu2 is coordinated by two pyridyl nitrogen atoms from distinct 3-abpt molecules, two carboxylate oxygen atoms from different benzoic acids in unidentate mode, and two oxygen atoms from two water molecules in octahedral geometry. Similarity, Cu2\u2013O5 (2.530(3) \u00c5) is longer than Cu2\u2013O3 (1.957(2) \u00c5), suggesting its weak coordination. The bidentate 3-abpt ligands with cis -fashion link the Cu centers to furnish a zigzag chain with Cu \u22ef Cu distances of 9.4014(9) \u00c5, as shown in Fig. 4 a. Furthermore, these adjacent chains are linked by hydrogen bonds such as O(1W)\u2013H(1D) \u22ef O(2), O(1W)\u2013H(1E) \u22ef N(5), and O(5)\u2013H(5D) \u22ef O(4) (\u2212 x , \u2212 y + 1, \u2212 z + 1) to display a 2D (4,4) grid layer as sql topology (see Fig. S6 ). Finally, these layers are stacked into a 3D framework by interlayer \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction between two phenyl rings of adjacent benzoic acids, as well as two triazole rings of 3-abpt ligands with perpendicular and centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.357(2), 3.739(8) \u00c5 and 3.429(2), 3.868(5) \u00c5, respectively ( Fig. 4 b). A computation of these layer voids by using the platon program suggests a value of 518.1 \u00c5 3 , corresponding to 30.4% of the unit-cell volume. 3.5 Synthesis Four new 3-abpt-metal-polycarboxylate coordination polymers have been isolated by using different reactive routes, namely, (i) direct assembly in water/methanol/DMF solution under the ambient condition and crystallization via solvent evaporation for compound 1 and 4 ; (ii) hydrothermal synthesis at 140 \u00b0C for compound 2 and 3 . We also tried to prepare compound 1 by hydrothermal synthesis. But it failed. During the reaction process, we found the metal-to-ligand ratio is a key factor for the preparation of these crystalline materials. 3.6 Infrared spectra The compounds 1 \u2013 4 contain 3-abpt, carboxylate, coordinated water, and lattice water, which are in agreement with their IR spectra. The broad absorption bands from 3400 to 3200 cm \u22121 are assigned to coordinated or lattice water with strong hydrogen-bonding interactions. In the IR spectrum of 1 , the asymmetric stretching vibration \u03bd as (COO \u2212 ) was observed at 1564 cm \u22121 , and the symmetric stretching vibration \u03bd s (COO \u2212 ) was at 1367 cm \u22121 . These peaks were shifted to lower values compared with the carbonyl frequencies of free 1,2,4,5-H 4 beta. The absence of the band around 1730 cm \u22121 for a protonated carboxylic group shows that the carboxyl groups of the organic acid are completely deprotonated. In compound 2 and 3 , the ip ligand exhibits \u03bd as (COO \u2212 ) strong absorptions at 1614, 1599 cm \u22121 and \u03bd s (COO \u2212 ) strong absorptions at 1383, 1373 cm \u22121 , respectively. The compound 4 shows \u03bd as (COO \u2212 ) absorption at 1558 cm \u22121 and \u03bd s (COO \u2212 ) absorption at 1383 cm \u22121 . Their formulas have been confirmed by elemental analysis data and X-ray structural analysis. 3.7 Thermal stability As shown in Fig. S7 for TGA curves, compound 1 loses lattice water and coordination water in the range 100\u2013150 \u00b0C with an endothermic peak at 126 \u00b0C (found: 7.81%, calc.: 7.24%). The remaining substance is thermally stable upon heating to 300 \u00b0C. Over the temperature of 350 \u00b0C, the observed weight loss of 32.56% is attributed to the elimination of beta ligands (calc.: 33.52%). The final residue should be ZnO. Compound 2 releases all lattice water in the range 110\u2013180 \u00b0C with an endothermic peak at 154 \u00b0C (found: 11.75%, calc.: 10.36%). The remaining substance is thermally stable upon heating to 200 \u00b0C, following by a series of weight losses, until possibly a final residue ZnO formed. In the TGA curve of 3 , the first weight loss of 13.59% in 100\u2013140 \u00b0C corresponds to the removal of lattice and coordination water (calc.: 13.35%), with an endothermic peak at 117 \u00b0C. The remaining substance is thermally stable upon heating to 300 \u00b0C. Further heating to 750 \u00b0C reveals a continuous weight loss of the sample. The TGA curve of 4 is analogous to the curves of others, showing the first weight loss of 2.99% in 90\u2013110 \u00b0C that refers to lose of two lattice water molecules. The second weight loss of 3.47% in 100\u2013150 \u00b0C corresponds to the removal of remaining water molecules that have some weak coordination interaction with Cu2 center. Further heating to 750 \u00b0C possibly led to the final residue CuO formed. 3.8 Photoluminescent properties The luminescent properties of several 3-abpt-metal-polycarboxylate coordination polymers explored by others indicate that emission colors of organic spacers were remarkably affected by their incorporation into metal-containing coordination compounds [14\u201321] . Thus, we reported herein the photoluminescence of compound 1 in the solid state under room temperature. As shown in Fig. S8 , upon excitation of the solid sample at 360 nm, intense band in the emission spectrum is observed at 440 nm. To understand more thoroughly the nature of this emission band, the luminescence of 3-abpt ligand was also investigated. For 3-abpt, the emission maximum is present at 388 nm. Even though there is a significant shift in the emission wavelength for the bound ligand, it probably come from intraligand \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transitions. 4 Conclusions In this work, phenyl-polycarboxylic acids from monodentate to polydentate are introduced to construct with versatile building block 3-abpt obtaining four diversity configuration. Compound 1 is 3D structure with bbf-3,4-Cccm topology. Compounds 2 \u2013 4 are all 1D chains, but exhibit a variety of structures. In contrast to the three different 1D chains mentioned above, although using the same ligand and metal, two different structures of compounds 2 and 3 appear. One is tubular-like chain and the other one is ring-like network. It can be seen that the diverse coordination number of zinc center result in the difference. In compound 2 , Zn(II) atom is in a disorder tetrahedron coordination environment. While in compound 3 , Zn(II) centers display an octahedral geometry. Steric hindrance and spatial effect might effect the arrangement of the same ligand at the same time. When we using the benzoic acid ligand instead of isophthalic acid, 1D zigzag chain of 4 is obtained, in which benzoic acids serve in terminating roles, restricting the spatial extensions of structure. However, when using the \u03bc 4 -bridging beta ligands, we found 3D compound 1 , in which beta ligands exhibit two different coordination modes. Comparing with other compounds, the \u03bc 4 -bridging beta ligands result in the high dimensionalities of 1 . From above, we can see the structural discrepancy is depended on many factors, such as subtle interplay of metal coordination preferences, ligand type, spatial extension, and steric constraints. They play important roles in the formation of these framework materials. This result undoubtedly discovers the tectonic effect of ligands in metal\u2013organic frameworks. As expected, subtle interplay of metal coordination preferences, spatial extension, and steric constraints also effect on the construction of coordination networks. On the other hand, hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking force in these four compounds might play important roles in molecular recognition and assembly. This work prompts us to achieve more functional materials by employing a bent ligand 3-abpt and other angular, linear or polydentate ligands, and further efforts on this perspective are underway.

Abstract Reaction of 2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032-biphenyltetracarboxylic acid (2,4-H 4 bptc), Zn(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 6H 2 O in the presence of NaOH hydrothermally at 180 \u00b0C affords the first 2,4-H 4 bptc complex [Zn 3 (\u03bc 3 -OH) 2 (2,4-bptc)] n \u00b7 2nH 2 O (1). Crystal structure indicates that 1 is Zn 2 (OH) 2 diamond-core chains linked through 2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032-biphenyltetracarboxylate. 1 was characterized by TG, IR and fluorescence spectra. 1 is the first example of 2,4-H 4 bptc complex and also first neat Zn 2 (OH) 2 diamond-core chains. Keywords 2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032-Biphenyltetracarboxylic acid Zn 2 (OH) 2 diamond-core chains Crystal structure Hydrothermal synthesis The crystal engineering of supramolecular architectures based on metal and organic building blocks has been rapidly expanding in recent years owing to their novel and diverse topologies and potential applications in host\u2013guest chemistry, catalysis, electrical conductivity, and magnetism [1] . Multicarboxylate ligands have been proven to be good candidates because they can be regarded not only as hydrogen-bonding acceptors but also as hydrogen-bonding donors, depending upon the number of deprotonated carboxylic groups [2] . Of the aromatic carboxylates, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate, 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate have been studied extensively. More recently, porous coordination polymers assembled from larger carboxylates, such as biphenyldicarboxylate, biphenyl-3,5,3\u2032,5\u2032-tetracarboxylic acid(3,5-H 4 bptc) complexes [3\u20136] and 3,4-H 4 bptc complexes have been reported ( Scheme 1 ) [2,7,8] . On the other hand, molecular metal oxide complexes can serve as valuable models in various areas, including surface\u2013substrate interactions in heterogeneous catalysis, metal oxide/hydroxide particles in porous solids, deposition, precipitation, and condensation reactions that lead to M x O y framework structures [9] . High oxidation-state metal hydroxide/oxide complexes exhibit a variety of frameworks, in which the metal centers are shielded by anionic organic ligands. Complex hydroxide/oxides of +I and +II metal ions bearing more than two hydroxide/oxide centers are rare [9,10] . Oxygen bridged dimetal complexes M 2 (\u03bc-X ) 2 (X = O, OH, or OH 2 ) is called diamond-core. Diamond-core structure play an important role in a number of important enzyme and metalloprotein systems, such as methane monooxygenase [11\u201313] . Maggard reported a pillared hybrid solids with access to coordinatively unsaturated metal sites [14] . Zn\u2013(\u03bc 3 -OH)\u2013Zn diamond-core linked through a octahedral Zn has been reported by Loiseau et al. [15] . Phosphate bridged Zn\u2013O chain also been reported [16] . To our knowledge, Zn 2 (OH) 2 diamond-core chain is still unknown. Here we report the first coordination polymer assembled from 2,4-H 4 bptc. It is a neat Zn 2 (OH) 2 diamond-core chains linked through bptc 4\u2212 . This is the first coordination polymer of 2,4-H 4 bptc. Compound [Zn 3 (\u03bc 3 -OH) 2 (2,4-bptc)] n \u00b7 2nH 2 O ( 1 ) resulted from Zn(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 6H 2 O, 2,4-H 4 bptc and 1 mol/L NaOH hydrothermally at 180 \u00b0C for 3 days [17] . Crystal structure analysis [18] shows that there are three Zn ions in asymmetric unit ( Fig. 1 a). Zn1 coordinated to three carboxylate oxygens and one hydroxido oxygen to form a tetrahedron coordination environment. Zn2 and Zn3 ate both coordinated to five oxygen atoms. Zn2 coordination to two three carboxylate oxygen and two hydroxido oxygen while Zn3 coordinate to two carboxylate oxygen and three hydroxido oxygen atoms. The \u03c4 value for Zn2 and Zn3 are 0.14 and 0.36, respectively, which indicates that Zn2 is essentially square-pyramidal and Zn3 in a distorted square-pyramidal [19] . Each L 4\u2212 coordinates to six Zn(II) ions. Interestingly, Zn 2 (OH) 2 forms diamond-core and the diamond-core is linked via O10\u2013Zn3 to form a neat diamond-core chain as shown in Fig. 1 b. Zn1 binds to the diamond-core chain via hydroxido O9. The diamond-core has a dihedral angle 65.55(23)\u00b0. The Zn\u2013O\u2013Zn angles in the diamond-core are 99.36(11) and 97.72(11), while the O\u2013Zn\u2013O angles are 80.64(11) and 82.28(11), respectively. The Zn3\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Zn3 and Zn2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Zn2 distances in the diamond-core are 3.152(2) and 3.132(2) \u00c5, respectively. All other Zn\u2013O\u2013Zn angles out side the diamond-core, ranges from 111.36(13) to 136.54(15), are larger than that in the diamond-core chain. The two benzene rings in the L 4\u2212 have a dihedral angle of 76.91(55), which is almost perpendicular to each other. The O2 and O5 of 2- and 2\u2032-carboxylate oxygen coordinate to Zn2 simultaneously to form a 9-membered ring ( Fig. 1 b). Therefore, the 2- and 2\u2032-carboxylate can be considered in cis -conformation. The O5\u2013C9\u2013O6 carboxylate is almost perpendicular to the benzene ring (98.04\u00b0). The other 2-carboxylate has a dihedral angle (with benzene ring) of 36.81(53)\u00b0. Both of the 4-carboxylates, O4\u2013C8\u2013O3 and O7\u2013C16\u2013O8 are almost coplanar to the benzene ring (2.18\u20135.27\u00b0 torsion angle). It can clearly see that the complex is composed of Zn 2 (OH) 2 chains linked through fully deprotonated 2,4-bptc 4\u2212 . As shown in Fig. 1 c, each 2,4-bptc 4\u2212 binds to three Zn 2 ( OH ) 2 2 + diamond-core chains. The 2- and 2\u2032-carboxylate binds one Zn 2 ( OH ) 2 2 + chain. One the 4-carboxylate binds a Zn 2 ( OH ) 2 2 + diamond-core chain via O3 and O4, the other 4-carboxylate binds third Zn 2 (OH) 2 2+ chain via O7 ( Fig. 1 d). The distances between adjacent chains are 9.94, 11.43 and 16.97 \u00c5, respectively ( Fig. 1 d). The thermal stability has also been examined by TGA analysis and is shown in Fig. s1 . The crystal easily lost crystalline water molecules. Two crystalline water molecules completely lost at 202 \u00b0C (obs. 5.6%; calcd. 6.0%). The complex further lose 7.1% corresponding to CO 2 (7.4%) [20] . Further increase temperature leads to completely decompose of the framework. The IR spectra of the zinc complex ( Fig. s2 ) shows characteristic bands of carboxylate groups at 1617 cm \u22121 for the asymmetric stretching and at 1434 cm \u22121 and 1404 cm \u22121 for symmetric stretching. The separation ( \u0394 ) between \u03bd asym (COO) and \u03bd sym (COO) are 183 cm \u22121 and 216 cm \u22121 , respectively, indicating that carboxylate is coordinated with Zn atoms not only in a monodentate fashion, but also in a 1, 3-bidentate bridging fashion. The 1002 cm \u22121 peak can be attributed to the bending vibration of OH \u2212 in the complex. [21] These data are consistent with the crystal structure. Solid state emission/excitation spectra at room temperature shows significant red-shift in complex 1 compared free ligand 2,4-H 4 bptc due to deprotonation of the ligand in complex ( Fig. 2 ). Free 2, 4-H 4 bptc has an emission maximum at 423 nm (excited at 358 nm); while in complex this maximum is 442 nm (388 nm excitation). Excitation spectra in free ligand shows two peaks at 351 nm and 358 nm, while in complex, these maximum shifted to 391 nm and 409 nm ( Fig. s3 ). Due to Zn(II) is not a redoxable ion, we attribute all the fluorescence to ligand emission/excitation.

Complexes 1 and 2 are homochiral coordination polymers. 1 is a 1D left-handed helical chain coordination polymer constructed from tri- and tetra-dentate camphorate. 2 exhibits a 2D polymeric network assembled by tri-dentate camphorate, which belongs to 3-connected {4.82} topology. 3 is a 2D achiral coordination polymer assembled by left-and right-handed 1D Co-camphorate helical chains. It is rarely observed that D-cam ligand changes to L-cam under hydrothermal condition. Three complexes are all thermally stable up to 316-425 \u00b0C. 1 and 2 show violet luminescence originating from ligand-centered emission. 3 exhibits an antiferromagnetic interaction in Co II 2 dimer withJ = -4.34 cm 1. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Complex 2 is a 2-D coordination polymer assembled by bis-monodentate pam and 4,4\u2032-bipyridine, where acetonitrile is filled in the rectangle channels. Both 2-D coordination polymers display undulated (4,4) grid layers as sql topology. Complex 3 displays a 1-D polymeric chain using chelating bis-bidentate pam as bridging ligand. Complex 4 exhibits an interesting bis-monodentate pam-Mn(II) 1-D polymeric chain, in which exist two-type six-coordinated manganese centers. Mn(1) is bound to four pyridine ligands, whereas Mn(2) is combined to two pyridine and two H 2 O molecules. Their thermal stabilities have been investigated.

Keywords Coordination polymer Pamoic acid 4,4\u2032-Bipyridine Crystal structure Thermal analysis Luminescence 1 Introduction The construction of coordination polymers has evoked considerable attention and become a quite active research field due to their diverse and intriguing polymeric structures with potential applications as functional materials [1\u20134] . The final structures of coordination polymers are dependent mainly upon the geometrical and electronic properties of ligands and metal ions, and also strongly influenced by other factors such as counter-ion, solvent, pH value, temperature, and metal-to-ligand ratio [5,6] . In particular, aromatic polycarboxylate and N-heterocyclic ligands have been shown to be good building blocks in the design of coordination polymers with desired topologies owing to their rich coordination modes and H-bonding interactions. 4,4\u2032-Methylenebis(3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid) (pamoic acid, Scheme 1 ) is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a counter ion to obtain long-acting formulations of certain basic drugs [7,8] . In spite of pamoic acid is a common industrial precursor, its coordination behavior is not very clear to date. Pamoic acid is a multifunctional ligand containing both carboxylic and phenoxy groups, which has one half-molecule in the asymmetric unit and the two naphthyl rings are linked with a methylene bridge. H 2 pam as a bridging ligand possesses both flexibility and rigidity, since two napthyl rings can freely rotate at different degrees across the methylene (\u2013CH 2 \u2013) group, which can potentially exhibit various coordinate modes and diverse frameworks. Several H 2 pam complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized [9\u201312] . Most of them contain chelating phen and 2,2\u2032-bipy as co-ligands. With the aim of further understanding the coordination behavior of pamoic acid, we have prepared four new H 2 pam coordination polymers. Herein, we report their synthesis, crystal structures, thermal stabilities and luminescence. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods All chemicals were analytical grade and obtained from commercial sources without further purification. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were carried out with a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Nicolet A370 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr pellets in the 4000\u2013400 cm \u22121 region. The powder X-ray diffraction data were recorded on a Rigaku DLMAX-2550 diffractometer. Thermal analyses were completed on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA85e thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 in nitrogen. Luminescent spectrum was recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5301 spectrophotometer. 2.2 Synthesis of complexes 2.2.1 [Co(pam)(4,4\u2032-bipy)] n \u00b7 n H 2 O ( 1 ) A mixture of Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O (0.117 g, 0.4 mmol), pamoic acid (0.077 g, 0.2 mmol), 4,4\u2032-bipyridine (0.031 g, 0.2 mmol) and NaOH (0.016 g, 0.4 mmol) in 10 mL ethanol/H 2 O (v/v = 4:1) was placed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor, which was sealed and heated in an oven at 140 \u00b0C for 72 h.

Determinations of the crystal system, orientation matrix, and cell dimensions were performed according to the established procedures. Lorentz polarization and absorption correction were applied. The structures were solved by the direct methods and refined on F 2 by full-matrix least-squares techniques with SHELXTL -2000 program [13] . All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were placed geometrically and refined using the riding model. The crystal data and structural refinements are summarized in Table 1 . Selected bond distances and angles are given in Table 2 . The measured and simulated powder X-ray diffraction patterns of coordination polymers 1 \u2013 4 are shown in Fig. S2 ( supplementary data ). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and infrared spectra Pamoic acid has poor solubility in many common solvents at room temperature. Complexes 1 and 2 were prepared by solvothermal reactions of H 2 pam and metal nitrates in the presence of 4,4\u2032-bipyridine and NaOH in mixed solvent systems. The 4,4\u2032-bipyridine and pam dianion play bridging ligands in the resulting coordination polymers. Complexes 3 and 4 were prepared by solvent evaporating method involved H 2 pam and metal salts in a pyridine-water mixed solvent system. The pyridine can act as an organic base and monodentate ligand in the reactions. Although 1,10-phenanthroline and 4,4\u2032-bipyridine were respectively added to the reaction mixtures of 3 and 4 , however, both complexes contain none of them. Only pam dianion and pyridine coordinate to metal ions to form polymers. The absence of characteristic absorption of \u03bd as (COOH) near 1700 cm \u22121 indicates that pamoic acid is completely deprotoned in 1\u20134 . The \u03bd as (COO \u2212 ) vibrations of carboxylate groups occur at 1637, 1638, 1638, and 1639 cm \u22121 for 1\u20134 , respectively. While those of \u03bd s (COO \u2212 ) occur at 1402, 1343, 1395, and 1351 cm \u22121 , respectively. The \u0394(\u03bd as \u2212 \u03bd s ) different values of 235 cm \u22121 for 1 and 243 cm \u22121 for 3 are much smaller than those of 295 cm \u22121 for 2 and 288 cm \u22121 for 4 , which are consistent with the chelating bis-bidentate carboxyl coordinate mode in 1 , 3 , and the bis-monodentate mode in 2 , 4 ( Scheme 1 ) [14,15] . Their formulas have been confirmed by elemental analysis and X-ray structural analysis. 3.2 Description of crystal structures 3.2.1 [Co(pam)(4,4\u2032-bipy)] n \u00b7 n H 2 O ( 1 ) X-ray structural analysis revealed that complex 1 is a two-dimensional coordination polymer formed by 4,4\u2032-bipyridine and pam bridging ligands. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the cobalt center adopts a distorted octahedral geometry, coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from different 4,4\u2032-bipyridine and four oxygen atoms from two pam ligands. Both 4,4\u2032-bipyridine ligands are arranged in cis conformation with a N(1)\u2013Co(1)\u2013N(2) angle of 101.1(2)\u00b0. Average Co\u2013N bond distance is 2.080 \u00c5. It is obviously less than the Cd\u2013N distance of 2.335(3) \u00c5 in a 3-D coordination polymer [Cd 5 (OAc) 4 (OH) 2 (pam) 2 (4,4\u2032-bipy) 2 ] n [14] . Both carboxyl groups of pam adopt the chelating bis-bidentate coordination mode ( Scheme 1 a). The Co\u2013O bond distances vary from 2.026(4) to 2.424(5) \u00c5. Previously, Du et al. have structurally characterized two 2-D coordination polymer [Cu(pam)(4,4\u2032-bipy)(dmf) 2 ] n and [Cd(pam)(4,4\u2032-bipy) 2 ] n \u00b7 n H 2 O, in which 4,4\u2032-bipyridine ligands coordinate to metal ions in trans conformation [10] . The V-shaped pam dianion acts as a tetradentate ligand to link up two cobalt ions to form a 1-D zigzag chain. The dihedral angle between both naphthyl rings is 84.1\u00b0. The adjacent 1-D chains are further connected by 4,4\u2032-bipyridine linkers to form a 2-D double-layered polymeric network ( Fig. 1 b). It displays an undulated 2-D (4,4) grid layer as sql topology ( Fig. 1 c). Both hydroxide groups of pam are uncoordinated and bound to carboxyl O(2) and O(4) with strong hydrogen bonds of O(3)\u2013H(3)\u22efO(2) 2.547(5) \u00c5 and O(6)\u2013H(6)\u22efO(4) 2.594(5) \u00c5. The packing diagram is shown in Fig. 1 d, which is porous and incorporated lattice water in the channels. 3.2.2 [Ni(pam)(4,4\u2032-bipy)(H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b72 n CH 3 CN ( 2 ) Complex 2 is a two-dimensional coordination polymer formed by 4,4\u2032-bipyridine and pam bridging ligands. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the nickel center is six-coordinated by two nitrogen and four oxygen atoms, forming a distorted octahedral geometry. On the equatorial plane, two 4,4\u2032-bipyridine ligands are arranged in cis conformation with a N(1)\u2013Ni(1)\u2013N(1A) angle of 91.5(1)\u00b0. The Ni\u2013N bond distance is 2.073(2) \u00c5. Two aqua molecules coordinate to nickel ion with Ni\u2013O bond distance 2.064(2) \u00c5. The pam dianion exhibits the bis-monodentate coordination mode ( Scheme 1 b). Two monodentate carboxyl groups occupy the axial positions with Ni\u2013O bond distance 2.083(2) \u00c5. This is obviously different with the coordination structure of 1 . Each pam bidentate ligand links two Ni(II) centers to form an infinite polymeric chain along a axis ( Fig. 2 b). The dihedral angle between both naphthyl rings is 77.8\u00b0. Such 1-D chains are further linked by 4,4\u2032-bipyridine to form a 2-D polymeric network. It also displays an undulated 2-D (4,4) grid layer as sql topology ( Fig. 2 c). The 2-D layered networks are arranged in a parallel fashion to afford 1-D rectangle channels, in which the guest CH 3 CN molecules filled ( Fig. 2 d). Both hydroxide groups of pam are uncoordinated, and bound to carboxyl O(1) with strong intramolecular hydrogen bond of O(3)\u2013H(3)\u22efO(1) 2.514(3) \u00c5. The carboxyl O(2) combines O(1W) through H-bond of O(1W)\u2013H(1WA)\u22efO(2) 2.635(3) \u00c5. 3.2.3 [Cd(pam)(py) 2 ] n \u00b7 n py ( 3 ) Complex 3 is a one-dimensional coordination polymer. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the cadmium center is in a distorted octahedral geometry, coordinated by two pyridyl nitrogen and four oxygen atoms from two chelating carboxyl groups. Average Cd\u2013N bond distance is 2.29 \u00c5. Cd\u2013O bond distances vary from 2.321(6) to 2.348(7) \u00c5. The pam dianion adopts the chelating bis-bidentate coordination mode. Each pam tetradentate ligand links two Cd(II) ions to form a 1-D infinite chain along a axis ( Fig. 3 b). The Cd\u22efCd separation is 11.755(3) \u00c5. Every Cd(II) center is bound by two pyridine ligands in cis fashion. The N(1)\u2013Cd(1)\u2013N(2) bond angle is 88.7(2)\u00b0. The 1-D polymeric chains are parallel stacked as shown in Fig. 3 c. There exist uncoordinated pyridine molecules in the crystal lattice. Both hydroxide groups of pam are uncoordinated and bound to carboxyl O(2) and O(5) with strong hydrogen bonds of O(3)\u2013H(3)\u22efO(2) 2.560(7) \u00c5 and O(4)\u2013H(4)\u22efO(5) 2.557(7) \u00c5. The flexible skeleton of pam is twisted and the hydroxy and carboxyl groups adopt a trans conformation to minimize the steric hindrance. The dihedral angle between both naphthyl rings is 82.6\u00b0. The uncommon cis conformation of pam was observed in [Zn(pam)(phen)] n [12] . Comparing the structures of 1 and 3 , both metal centers are cis six-coordinated by two pyridyl groups and two chelating carboxyl groups. Two 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoate pieces of pam are arranged in similar trans conformation. Different with the 1-D polymeric chain of 3 , the complex 1 displays a 2-D polymeric layer by introducing bridging 4,4\u2032-bipyridine ligand. 3.2.4 [Mn 2 (pam) 2 (py) 6 (H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b72 n py ( 4 ) Complex 4 displays an interesting 1-D polymeric chain, in which exist two-type manganese coordination centers. As shown in Fig. 4 , each asymmetric unit contains two independent Mn(II) ions, two pam ligands, two coordinated aqua molecules, and six coordinated pyridine as well as two lattice pyridine molecules. The Mn(1) center adopts a centro-symmetric octahedral coordination geometry, being surrounded by four pyridine and two monodentate carboxylic groups in trans configuration. Mn(1)\u2013N bond distances vary from 2.279(4) to 2.316(4) \u00c5. Mn(1)\u2013O distance is 2.156(3) \u00c5. The Mn(2) center is also in a centro-symmetric octahedral geometry, but coordinated by two pyridine [Mn(2)\u2013N 2.318(5) \u00c5], two H 2 O molecules [Mn(2)\u2013O 2.160(5) \u00c5], and two monodentate carboxyl groups [Mn(2)\u2013O 2.150(3) \u00c5] in trans configuration. Each pam dianion adopts the bis-monodentate coordination mode to bridge Mn(1) and Mn(2) ions. This leads to the formation of a 1-D polymeric chain. The Mn(1)\u22efMn(2) separation is 15.419(4) \u00c5, which is obviously longer than the Cd\u22efCd separation in 3 . The dihedral angle between both naphthyl rings is 86.1\u00b0. The 1-D polymeric chains are arranged in a parallel fashion as shown in packing diagram. Uncoordinated pyridine is incorporated in the crystal lattice. Both hydroxide groups of pam are uncoordinated and bound to carboxyl O(2) and O(5) with strong hydrogen bonds of O(3)\u2013H(3)\u22efO(2) 2.537(5) \u00c5 and O(6)\u2013H(6)\u22efO(5) 2.532(5) \u00c5. Unlike the well-known 2,2\u2032-dihydroxy-1,1\u2032-binaphthyl (binol) ligand which contains coordinated hydroxide groups, the hydroxide groups of pam are free in all reported pam compounds. Pam prefers to form 1-D polymeric chains with the metal ions, which can be extended to 2-D coordination polymers by introducing bridging ligands such as 4,4\u2032-bipyridine. 3.3 Thermal stabilities and luminescence Thermal analyses for coordination polymers 1\u20134 were performed in the temperature range of 20\u2013800 \u00b0C. Their TGA curves are shown in Fig. S3 . Complex 1 lost 2.86% lattice water near 50 \u00b0C (calc. 2.90%). [Co(4,4\u2032-bipy)(pam)] n is stable up to 350 \u00b0C, and then released 4,4\u2032-bipy and pam ligands. The resulting residue is Co 2 O 3 (found 13.59%, calc. 13.40%). Complex 2 lost two lattice acetonitrile molecules in 150\u2013200 \u00b0C (found 11.32%, calc. 11.41%). The 4,4\u2032-bipy and pam ligands released after 350 \u00b0C. The final residue is NiO (found 12.61%, calc. 10.10%). Complex 3 released lattice pyridine before 150 \u00b0C (found 11.63%, calc. 10.75%). Two coordinated pyridine molecules released in 170\u2013270 \u00b0C (found 22.49%, calc. 21.50%). Pam ligand decomposed in the temperature range of 300\u2013600 \u00b0C (found 49.75%, calc. 50.32%). The final, thermal stable residue is CdO (found 16.13%, calc. 17.45%). Complex 4 lost coordinated water near 110 \u00b0C (found 2.24%, calc. 2.32%). In the range of 120\u2013320 \u00b0C, the complex 4 lost two lattice pyridine and six coordinated pyridine molecules with a total weight-loss of 42.48% (calc. 40.78%). Pam ligand decomposed in 320\u2013800 \u00b0C (found 49.75%, calc. 50.32%). The final residue is MnO 2 (found 13.71%, calc. 11.21%). Comparing the structures and thermal stabilities of above four pam coordination polymers, pam adopts chelating and bridging coordinate mode, which leads to higher thermal stability. Usually, pam ligand starts to decompose after 320 \u00b0C [17] . Generally, d 10 transition metal complexes display varied luminescence in the solid state. Organic ligands and their coordination modes obviously affect their emission wavelengths and luminescent mechanisms. We have determined the luminescence of cadmium complex 3 . Upon excitation at 378 nm, this compound exhibits strong green luminescence with maximum emission peak at 543 nm ( Fig. S4 ). The free pamoic acid shows a weak emission peak at 473 nm. Generally, ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) is the most common assignment for the luminescence of cadmium complexes [16] . Most of naphthyl carboxylate\u2013cadmium(II) complexes exhibit green luminescence [9,17] . So we assign the luminescent mechanism of 3 to a LMCT mechanism, where the electron is transferred from pam ligand to Cd(II). 4 Conclusions Four novel coordination polymers containing flexible pamoic acid ligand were synthesized. They possess 1-D and 2-D polymeric structures. Both carboxyl groups of pamoic acid adopt bis-monodentate and bis-bidentate coordination modes. This study demonstrates that pamoic acid is capable of coordinating metal centers through bifunctional carboxyl groups. Hydroxide groups of pam trend to form hydrogen bonds with carboxyl group or coordinated water. The pamoic acid is a valuable bridging ligand in constructing coordination polymers. Photoluminescence experiment shows that the pam cadmium complex is a good candidate for green emission material.

Their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and further characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectra, powder X-ray diffraction, circular dichroism, and thermogravimetric analysis. Complex 1 features a 3D porous metal-organic framework, which is a rare example to obtain a homochiral compound from achiral components. Complex 2 exhibits a 2D polymeric network constructed from \u03bc2-cyanide, \u03bc2-4-abpt, and monodentate 4-abpt ligands. Complex 3 is a homochiral 1D helical chain polymer. Complex 4 displays a 1D ladder-like polymeric structure in which cptpy- is tetradentate and D-Hcam- acts as a side arm. Complex 5 displays a homochiral 2D network with (4,4) topology. Complex 6 shows a [Cd2(D-cam)(L-cam)] n (4,4)-connected network with a paddle-wheel Cd2(COO) 4 as node, which is further pillared by a btmbb spacer into a 3D metal-organic framework. d-Camphoric acid underwent racemization under hydrothermal conditions. Cd(II) complexes 1, 3, and 5 crystallize in chiral space groups, and their circular dichroism spectra exhibit obvious positive or negative Cotton effects. Moreover, 1, 3, and 5 are SHG-active, and the SHG efficiency, respectively, is 0.15, 0.4, and 0.4 times as much as that of KH 2PO4. All the complexes exhibit relatively high thermal stability. 1, 3, 5, and 6 emit violet luminescence originating from ligand-centered emission. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "title": "A two-dimensional copper polymer constructed from rod-shaped ferromagnetic secondary building units",
        "abstract": "Rod-shaped magnetic Cu 3 SUBs with S = 3/2 are bridged by end\u2013end azide ligands to form a 2D coordination polymer. Magnetic investigation shows the ferromagnetic coupling between Cu II ions and very weak antiferromagnetic interaction between clusters. Abstract On the basis of rod-shaped secondary building units (SBUs), a novel two-dimensional (2D) azide\u2013copper polymer, [Cu 3 (N 3 ) 4 (anol) 2 ] \u221e ( 1 ; anol = aminoethanol), was synthesized and structurally characterized. Complex 1 is a neutral 2D coordination network consisting of trinuclear copper(II) clusters [Cu 3 (N 3 ) 4 (anol) 2 ] connected with the bridge of end-end (EE) azide group. Magnetic data analysis shows that a metamagnetic behavior is observed for 1 which is associated with significant ferromagnetic coupling intracluster over 4 K. Keywords Azide\u2013copper Crystal structure Magnetic properties SBUs The coordination polymers construction of secondary building units (SBUs) have drawn more attention due to their various topologies of structures and fascinating properties, such as porosity, nonlinear optical property, and magnetism [1\u20135] . Since the SBUs have triangular, square, tetrahedral, and octahedral building-block geometries, which can show different spatial configurations and maintain their structural integrity throughout the self-assembly process, a variety of multi-dimensional coordination geometries can be found in the crystal structure of their complexes, i.e., one-dimensional (1D) [6] , 2D [7\u201311] , and 3D [12\u201317] . Thus it was implicated that the design of high-dimensional magnetic systems might be realized starting from magnetic SBUs. Indeed, Miyasaka group obtained a long-range ferrimagnetic ordering 3D polymers used Mn4 single-molecule magnet as the SBUs [18] and a few of magnetic compounds constructed from well-defined ferromagnetic precursors were subsequently reported [19,20] . Consequently, this strategy may provide new insights to the design of new magnetic materials by using magnetic SBUs to create bulk magnets. As we have known, some derivatives of aminoethanol reacting with copper(II) ions may easily produce ferromagnetic copper clusters [21\u201324] . In addition, azide ligand has been playing an important role in the design and synthesis of magnetic materials because azide bridge can mediate strong coupling between magnetic centres [25\u201329] . Therefore, in order to obtain the compounds with strong magnetic exchange between copper clusters, a two-dimensional polymer composed of rod-shaped Cu 3 SBUs directly linked by the azide ligands, [Cu 3 (N 3 ) 4 (anol) 2 ] \u221e ( 1 ; anol = aminoethanol) was prepared. Herein, we reported the synthesis, crystal structure and magnetic properties of 1 . The complex 1 was prepared by reaction of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 3H 2 O (48.5 mg, 0.2 mmol), aminoethanol (6.1 mg, 0.1 mmol) and NaN 3 (130.4 mg, 2 mmol) in methanol and water mixture for one month, giving brown crystals in a yield of 40% (based on Cu). Anal. Calcd (%) for C 4 H 12 Cu 3 N 14 O 2 : C, 10.03; H, 2.53; N, 40.95. Found: C, 10.00; H, 2.65; N, 40.89. Selected IR data (KBr, cm \u22121 ): \u03bd = 2012, 2031 and 2102 for the azide group. X-ray structural analysis [30] revealed that complex 1 is a neutral, two-dimensional coordination network based on trinuclear copper clusters [Cu 3 (N 3 ) 4 (anol) 2 ] joined by end-end (EE) azide groups. As shown in Fig. 1 , the basic unit contains three Cu(II) metal centres arranged in linear that are bridged by two end-on (EO) azide ligands and two \u03bc 2 -oxygen atom of two aminoethanol. In the unit, the Cu1 is five-coordination with a distorted square-pyramidal geometry, where one \u03bc 2 -oxygen atoms and a nitrogen atom of two aminoethanol with two nitrogen atom of two EO azide groups form the basal plane, while a nitrogen atom of one EE azide bridge occupies the apical position. The Cu2 is four-coordination described as distorted square planar. The basal Cu\u2013N bond lengths are in the range of 1.972\u20132.005 \u00c5 which is identical to Cu\u2013azide compounds [32\u201335] , and the apical Cu\u2013N bond lengths is 2.442(3) \u00c5. The Cu\u2013O bond lengths are 1.9535(19) \u00c5 and 1.9412(18) \u00c5, respectively. As the key parameter for magnetic coupling between metal centres, the Cu(1)\u2013N(1)\u2013Cu(2) and Cu(1)\u2013O(1)\u2013Cu(2) bond angles are 96.79(10)\u00b0 and 100.49(8)\u00b0. The central copper(II) atom Cu2 connected the two terminal copper(II) (Cu1 and Cu1A) by double bridges of EO azide and \u03bc 2 -O atoms to generate a linear trinuclear clusters. The clusters act as rod-shaped SBUs and are joined into a 2D network by the EE azide groups in the bc plane ( Fig. 2 ). Each rod-shaped unit is directly connected to four neighboring rods through four EE azide bridges. The Cu\u22efCu separation through the EO azide bridges is 2.994 \u00c5, and through the EE bridges is 5.011 \u00c5. In the solid state, the 2D network extend to three-dimension architecture by four hydrogen bonds of N7\u2013H7A\u22efO1 (symmetry: x , \u2212 y + 3/2, z \u2212 1/2), N7\u2013H7B\u22efN4 (symmetry: \u2212 x + 2, \u2212 y + 1, \u2212 z ), C2\u2013H2A\u22efN3 (symmetry: x \u2212 1, y , z \u2212 1), and C2\u2013H2B\u22efN3 (symmetry: x \u2212 1, \u2212 y + 3/2, z \u2212 1/2). Magnetic susceptibility measurements of the crystalline sample of 1 was carried out on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 SQUID magnetometer in an applied magnetic field of 2 KOe over the temperature range 1.8\u2013300 K. For 1 , the \u03c7 M T versus T plot is shown in Fig. 3 . At room-temperature \u03c7 M T value is 1.36 emu K mol \u22121 , slightly larger than the spin-only value of 1.24 emu K mol \u22121 based on uncoupled Cu 3 unit ( S Cu = 1/2 and assuming g Cu = 2.1). When the system is cooled, the \u03c7 M T value gradually increases and then rapidly below 50 K up to a maximum of 3.16 emu K mol \u22121 at 4 K, indicating ferromagnetic coupling between Cu II ions with a ground state spin S T = 3/2. Below 4 K, \u03c7 M T shows a sharp drop to 0.96 emu K mol \u22121 at 1.8 K, suggesting antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu 3 units. An additional evidence of S T = 3/2 is observed from the field dependence of magnetization at 1.8 K ( Fig. 4 ), where the saturation magnetization is 3.04 N\u03b2 mol \u22121 at 7 T. The sigmoidal shape of the magnetization curve is the signature of metamagnetic behavior [36,37] which is confirmed by the low-temperature M versus T plots at various fields in the inset of Fig. 4 . To estimate the magnetic coupling interaction between Cu II ions and the intermolecular interaction, the magnetic data can be simulated by the isotropic spin Hamiltonian H = \u22122 J ( S Cu1 S Cu2 + S Cu2 S Cu1A ), where J is the coupling constants mediated by double bridges of EO azide and \u03bc 2 -O atoms in cluster. When mean field correction was taken into account, the van Vleck equation can be written as follows: (1) \u03c7 = Ng 2 \u03b2 2 4 kT \u00d7 1 + e 2 J / kT + 10 e 3 J / kT 1 + e 2 J / kT + 2 e 3 J / kT , (2) \u03c7 M = \u03c7 / [ 1 - ( 2 zj \u2032 / Ng 2 \u03b2 2 ) \u03c7 ] . With this rough model, the calculated results in the temperature range from 5 to 300 K give: g = 2.18(5), J = 10.6(4) cm \u22121 , and zj \u2032 = 0.38(1) cm \u22121 with R = \u2211[( \u03c7 M T ) calc \u2212 ( \u03c7 M T ) obs ] 2 /\u2211( \u03c7 M T ) obs 2 = 5.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . The magnetic data are reasonable and can be rationalized in light of the structure. In compound 1 , Cu1 and Cu2 provide their d ( x 2 \u2212 y 2 ) magnetic orbitals extended along the basal plane of the copper ions. The N1 atom of EO bridges occupies equatorial coordination position to form ferromagnetic couplings. According to the density functional calculations, the coupling parameter J is involved in the structural parameters, such as the Cu(1)\u2013N(1)\u2013Cu(2) angle and the bond length of Cu\u2013N azide . At the same time, the oxygen bridges in the basal planes mediate the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction due to the Cu(1)\u2013O(1)\u2013Cu(2) bond angles larger than 98\u00b0 [38\u201340] . So the J value is actually a sum of two contributions from EO azide bridge and oxygen bridge, respectively, which has also been reported [41] . Because the axial Cu\u2013N bonds between trinuclear entities are long with 2.442(3) \u00c5, the mean field correction (zJ\u2032) is very weak. In summary, we have described the syntheses, single crystal structure and low-temperature magnetic behavior of the azide\u2013copper complex 1 . Complex 1 is a novel 2D azide\u2013copper polymer constructed by end-end model azide bridges between rod-shaped Cu 3 SBUs. A metamagnetic behavior is observed for 1 which is associated with significant ferromagnetic coupling intracluster over 4 K.

This one-pot multi-component process comprises an initial Michael addition and a subsequent intramolecular cyclization reaction. The effect of catalysts and solvents on the reaction efficiency and the yield were investigated. The structure of product 4f was further confirmed by XRD analysis. Meanwhile, further transformation of hemi-ketal moiety to the corresponding dehydrated product is also studied. In addition, a possible mechanism of this reaction is proposed herein. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Complex 1 is a one-dimension coordination polymer in which 2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole is deprotonated and adopts a bridging tridentate coordination mode. Complex 2 has ladder-like structure in which 2-(3-pyridyl)benzimidazole does not deprotonate and acts as a bidentate bridge. Complex 3 displays a saddle-shaped helical chain constructed through \u03bc 2 -cyanide group and the outstretched neutral 2-(4-pyridyl)benzimidazole monodentate ligand. Complex 4 shows two-dimension layer polymeric structure in which deprotonated 2-(4-pyridyl)benzimidazole acts as a tridentate bridging ligand. The cyanide groups in four complexes all act as bidentate bridging ligands. These complexes are thermal stable and display luminescence in the solid states.

        "abstract": "Eight coordination polymers {[Co 3(L) 2(H 2O) 6Cl 6]\u00b74H 2O} n (1), {[Co(L) 2Cl 2]\u00b713H 2O} n (2), {[Cu 3(L) 2(H 2O) 6Cl 6]\u00b74H 2O} n (3), {[Cu(L) 2Cl 2]\u00b712H 2O} n (4), {[Zn(L) 2(H 2O) 2](NO 3) 2\u00b74H 2O} n (5), {[Zn(L) 2(H 2O) 2](PF 6) 2\u00b76H 2O} n (6), {[ZnL(mal)] \u00b73H 2O} n (7), and {[Zn 3(L) 2(fum) 3(H 2O) 6]\u00b72H 2O} n (8) were synthesized by reactions of the flexible tripodal ligand 1,3,5-tris(triazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6- trimethylbenzene (L) and/or fumaric acid (H 2fum)/malonic acid (H 2mal), with corresponding metal salts, respectively. The structures of these polymers were established by elemental analysis, IR, powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Complexes 1 and 3 had an infinite two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb network. L as a cis-tridentate ligand coordinated to metal ions up and down alternatively. Complexes 2 and 4 possessed a one-dimensional (1D) chain hinged structure. L was a cis-bidentate ligand. Complexes 5 and 6 had a 2D network structure with (4,4) topology. L was a trans-bidentate ligand in 5, while in 6, L adopted a cis-configuration coordinated to metal ion bidentately. Complex 7 had a wavy 2D structure. L adopted a trans-configuration coordinated ion in the c-direction, while the malonate anion coordinated to metal ions in the b-direction in left- and right-helix alternatively. Complex 8 had an unusual 2D to three-dimensional (3D) interpenetration network structure. L was in trans-configuration coordinated to metal ions tridentately in the bc plane to form a ladder structure, and fumarate anion bridged the ladder in the a-axis to form a porous 2D coordination polymer. Adjacent 2D coordination polymers penetrated each other in the c-direction to form a 3D coordination with void dimensions consisting of 11 \u00c5 rhombic channels. The structures of 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4) indicate ligand/metal ratios had a significant influence on the structures of coordination polymers. The distinct structures of all these complexes demonstrated that the counteranions played an important role in the construction of coordination polymers. The isostructure between complexes 1 and 3, 2 and 4, and 5 indicate that the metal centers did not affect the structure of the complexes. Complex 8 with the characteristic of hydrophilic carboxylate groups and hydrophobic L was capable of absorbing water reversibly under 50 \u00b0C and encapsulating guest molecules, such as curcumin, diphenylcarbonohydrazide, and phenylfluorone, to form {(guest molecule) x \u2282 8} n. (where x = 0.2-0.4). The encapsulation behavior of 8 had been studied by elemental analysis, IR, thermogravimetric analysis (TG), and X-ray powder diffraction patterns (PXRD). Complex 8 could heterogeneously catalyze the oxidation of diphenylcarbonohydrazide in the presence of H 2O 2 in ethanol effectively. The oxidation process was facile, efficient, and environmental friendly. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

        "title": "Novel hexanuclear zinc(II) complex of 1,3,5-benzenemethyltriiminodiacetate",
        "abstract": "The titled cyclic dimer of a trinuclear zinc complex, {[Zn 3 (bmtac)(H 2 O) 8 ] \u00b7 6H 2 O} 2 , based on the flexible 1,3,5-benzenemethyltriiminodiacetic acid (H 6 bmtac) ligand not only is the first reported crystal structure of complex of H 6 bmtac, but also is possibly one of the largest hexanuclear zinc(II) complex. Abstract A novel cyclic dimer of a trinuclear zinc complex, {[Zn 3 (bmtac)(H 2 O) 8 ] \u00b7 6H 2 O} 2 , with very long Zn\u2013Zn distances, was synthesized in aqueous solution by adopting a new type of flexible multicarboxylate ligand, H 6 bmtac (H 6 bmtac = 1,3,5-benzenemethyltriiminodiacetic acid). The X-ray crystal structure of {[Zn 3 (bmtac)(H 2 O) 8 ] \u00b7 6H 2 O} 2 reveals that all Zn(II) ions are six-coordinated with octahedral geometry. The dimer as basic building units assembled into a three-dimensional supramolecular framework through the multiple intermolecular O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds interactions. The complex shows a blue fluorescent emission band at 428 nm as the result of the intraligand (\u03c0\u2013\u03c0 \u2217 ) fluorescent emission. Keywords Hexanuclear zinc complex Polycarboxylate Dimer Flexility There is continuing interest in crystal engineering of metal involved supramolecular architectures due to the novel structure topologies and potential applications, such as host-guest chemistry, catalysis and optical materials [1] . Polycarboxylate ligands are widely used to assembly supramolecular network organized by coordination bonds or hydrogen bonds and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction, not only for their greater thermal stability and versatile coordination mode, but also for the ability of serving as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. The rigid 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H 3 btc) is one of the most prevalent research subject and many supramolecular complexes have been obtained via self-assembly of the H 3 btc [2\u20136] . However, the rigid of the carboxyl groups on the molecule to some degree limit the outspread in 3D direction of metal organic frameworks and hinder the assembly of certain crystalline products [7] . Hence, Sun et al. have introduced a methylene group between benzene ring and terminal carboxylic group on H 3 btc and obtained cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes with the flexible 1,3,5-benzenetriacetic acid (H 3 bta) [8] . In addition, Hong et al. utilized a flexible iminodiacetic group to displace one of three carboxylic groups on the H 3 btc, and three coordination polymers involved Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) ions assembled from this ligand were reported [9] . To have a better understanding of the effects of flexibility on the structure and properties of the complexes with multicarboxylate ligands, we have synthesized a much more flexible ligand (1,3,5-benzenemethyltriiminodiacetic acid, H 6 bmtac). In this ligand, three iminodiacetic groups were introduced to benzene through mesitylene spacer ( Chart 1 ). It is known that iminodiacetic moiety is a very good tridentate chelating group when coordinating to most transition metal ions. To our knowledge, the copper(II) complex of H 6 bmtac has been used for surface recognition of protein [10] , but there has no any crystal structure of complexes based on H 6 bmtac been reported yet. Herein, we describe a novel cyclic hexanuclear zinc(II) complex with very long Zn\u2013Zn distance assembled from this new flexible ligand. A 3D supramolecular structure was constructed by multiple intermolecular O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen-bonding interactions. The flexible H 6 bmtac ligand was prepared by reacting 1,3,5-tri-(bromomethyl)-benzene with diethyliminodiacetate in dry CH 3 CN following a reported procedure [10] . The compound, [Zn 6 (bmtac) 2 (H 2 O) 16 ] \u00b7 12H 2 O was readily achieved by reaction of the ligand with zinc nitrate hexahydrate in the molar ratio of 1:3 in hot water [11] . Colorless crystals of the zinc complex were obtained directly from the reaction solution upon slow cooling. The crystal structure was determined by X-ray crystallography [12] . Due to the presence of methylene group between the central benzene ring and terminal iminodiacetic group in the flexible H 6 bmtac, the ligand can adopt different conformations according to the relative position of the coordination groups. For example cis , cis , cis and cis , trans , trans have been observed in 1,3,5- tris (imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene complexes [13,14] . Crystallographic analysis reveals that all the three iminodiacetate groups in the ligand are in the same direction toward the central benzene ring ( Fig. 1 ). Therefore, the conformation of the resulting zinc complex is cis , cis , cis , which is differ from the cis , trans , trans conformation of the Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes with 1,3,5-benzenetriacetate reported by Sun et al. [8] . The zinc complex crystallizes in triclinic system with space group P 1 \u00af , and the asymmetric unit [Zn 3 (bmtac)(H 2 O) 8 ] \u00b7 6H 2 O is composed of a bmtac 6\u2212 unit, eight coordination water and six lattice water molecules. With the symmetry elements of space group, the cyclic zinc dimer is generated by bridging Zn(2) and Zn(3) through carboxylic group O(9)\u2013C(19)\u2013O(10) as shown in Fig. 1 , which represents a rare example of the dimer containing six Zn(II) coordination centers. In contrast to all reported hexanuclear zinc complexes with a coordination number of 4-,5- and/or 4-,5-,6- mixture [15,16] , the Zn(II) ions in [Zn 6 (bmtac) 2 (H 2 O) 16 ] \u00b7 12H 2 O are all six-coordinated with distorted octahedral geometry, and there are two types of coordination environment for Zn(II) center. Both Zn(1) and Zn(3) bind one nitrogen atom and three oxygen atoms (one from aminodiacetic group and two from water molecules) in the equatorial plane and two oxygen atoms (one from aminodiacetic group and the other from water molecule) in the apical positions. The Zn(2) center is somewhat different from that of Zn(1) and Zn(3). The difference is that one oxygen atom from water molecule in the equatorial plane is replaced by one oxygen atom from aminodiacetic group in a neighboring molecule, whereas the apical position still remains the same as Zn(1) and Zn(3). Each iminodiacetate group coordinates to a Zn(II) ion in tridentate chelating mode, which leads to the formation of two five-member rings of ZnNC 2 O with a dihedral angle of 76.9\u00b0 to 100.1\u00b0. Furthermore, the acetic group in bmtac 6\u2212 anion exhibits two type of coordination fashion, ie. monodentate mode and 1,3-\u03bc 2 bidentate bridging mode. The bond lengths of Zn\u2013O in the range of 2.040(4)\u20132.156(4) \u00c5 and Zn\u2013N distances range from 2.198(4) to 2.245(4) \u00c5. As expected, the sphere d orbital will be used by the six-coordinated Zn(II), therefore, the Zn\u2013O and Zn\u2013N distances are longer than corresponding 4- and 5-coordinated analogs [16] but similar to those in 6-coordinated analogs [9,16] . It is noted that all assembled hexanuclear zinc complexes reported are bridged via oxo and/or 1,3-carboxylic oxygen atoms. The nearest Zn\u2013Zn distances range from 3.4 to 4.4 \u00c5 [15,16] . While in [Zn 6 (bmtac) 2 (H 2 O) 16 ] \u00b7 12H 2 O, the zinc(II) ions were linked by 1,3,5-substituted benzene. The Zn\u2013Zn distances within the ligand are Zn(1)\u2013Zn(3A) of 9.720(6), Zn(1)\u2013Zn(2) of 10.006(4) and Zn(2)\u2013Zn(3A) 10.400(5) \u00c5, while the shortest Zn\u2013Zn distances between adjacent ligands is Zn(2)\u2013Zn(3) of 5.976(3) \u00c5, which is bridged via 1,3-coordinating carboxylic oxygen atom. Hence, [Zn 6 (bmtac) 2 (H 2 O) 16 ] \u00b7 12H 2 O is possibly the largest hexanuclear zinc(II) complex except in hexameric wheel of porphyrins [17] . On the other hand, the Zn\u2013Zn distances are obviously shorter than the Cu\u2013Cu distances of 12 \u00c5 estimated by molecular modeling in Cu 3 (bmtac)(H 2 O) 3 complex [10] . Analysis of the crystal packing of the zinc complex shows that extensive O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen-bonding interactions exist, which result in a three-dimensional (3D) supermolecular hydrogen-bonding network. As shown in Fig. 2 , each [Zn 6 (bmtac) 2 (H 2 O) 16 ] building block is connected to adjacent molecules by multiple intermolecular O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds to give a one-dimensional polymeric chain. The typical hydrogen bonds are O1W\u22efO12 of 2.715(5) \u00c5, O2W\u22efO11 of 2.870(5) \u00c5 and O6W\u22efO3 of 2.679(5) \u00c5. The polymeric chains are further linked each other to form 2D supermolecular structure through hydrogen bonds (O7W\u22efO6 of 2.722(6) \u00c5) ( Fig. S1 ). In addition, the two-dimensional layers further assemble into a complicated three-dimensional network through the other intermolecular O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds between coordination water molecules and iminodiacetic oxygen atoms ( Fig. S2 ). Meanwhile, some of the oxygen atoms from lattice water molecules also formed intermolecular hydrogen-bonding with the coordination water molecules (O5W\u22efO9W of 2.690(5) \u00c5, O4W\u22efO10W of 2.813(5) \u00c5, O3W\u22efO11W of 2.725(7) \u00c5), which further stabilize its 3D structure. The IR spectra of the zinc complex shows characteristic bands of carboxylate groups at 1590 cm \u22121 for the asymmetric stretching and at 1444 cm \u22121 and 1404 cm \u22121 for symmetric stretching. The separation ( \u0394 ) between \u03c5 asym (COO) and \u03c5 sym (COO) are 146 cm \u22121 and 186 cm \u22121 , respectively, indicating that carboxylate is coordinated with Zn atoms not only in a monodentate fashion, but also in a 1,3-bidentate bridging fashion, which are consistent with the crystal structure [18] . The absence of the expected characteristic bands at 1730\u20131690 cm \u22121 indicates the complete deprotonation of H 6 bmtac on the reaction with Zn(II) ions. Thermogravimetric analyses (TG) were conducted to determine the thermal stability of the Zn complex. The TG curve of this Zn complex exhibits a continuous weight loss, hence it is difficult to give the exact weight loss percentage for each weight loss step in the TG curve, which is somewhat similar to that of the [Zn 7 (adip) 4 (H 2 O) 10 K 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] n \u00b7 4 n H 2 O compound [9] . However, it is still clear that the collapse of the framework occurred at 389 \u00b0C. The emission spectra of the free ligand and the Zn complex were investigated in the solid state at room temperature (see Fig. 3 ). Upon excitation at 357 nm, a broad strong blue fluorescent emission around 428 nm for the Zn complex is observed, which may derive from the intraligand (\u03c0\u2013\u03c0 \u2217 ) fluorescent emission considering similar emissions are observed at ca. 450 nm for the ligand. Additionally, the enhancement of the emissions for the Zn complex compared with those of the free ligand may be ascribed to the increase in the ligand conformational rigidity due to its coordination to Zn(II) ions resulting in a decrease in the non-radioactive decay of intraligand excited states. In conclusion, a novel cyclic hexanuclear zinc(II) complex with a flexible multicarboxylate ligand has been synthesized by the mild aqueous solution synthesis. The hexanuclear complex as a basic building units assemble into a three-dimensional structure through the multiple intermolecular O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds interactions. The complex shows a blue fluorescent emission band at 428 nm as the result of the intraligand (\u03c0\u2013\u03c0 \u2217 ) fluorescent emission.

The thermal stability and fluorescent property of 1 have also been investigated. Keywords 4-Amino-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole Azide Coordination polymer Crystal structure Topology Fluorescence The design and construction of coordination polymers are of great current interest, which results from their intriguing motifs and potential applications [1\u20133] . In particular, much attention has been paid to the development of crystal materials by using azide ligand because of its rich coordination fashions and magnetic properties [4] . This versatile ligand can act as a monodentate ligand as well as bridging ligand adopting the end-on (EO) or end-to-end (EE) modes. A huge number of complexes with various structures have been obtained by introducing co-bridging ligands to the metal-azide system [5,6] . While 1,2,4-triazole and its derivatives are also good candidates for the construction of various metal coordination polymers [7\u201310] . 4-Amino-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (3-abpt) is a rigid angular multifunctional ligand containing one triazole and two pyridyl groups, which can be served as monodentate [11] , bidentate [12,13] , and multidentate ligand [14] ( Fig. S1 ). Especially, it may provide three typical conformations owing to nitrogen atom occupying at 3-position of pyridyl ring [15] . Now we have concentrated on the construction of mixed-ligand coordination polymers based on azide and 3-abpt ligands, expecting to obtain remarkable class of materials with novel architectures and functions. On the other hand, multi-dimensional metal\u2013organic frameworks are closely related to various topological networks. It is mainly depended on the geometry of the ligands and central metal ions [16] . Particular attention has been attracted to the 2D topologies that contain three-, four-, or six-sided polygons with the features as (3, 6), (4, 4) and (6, 3) nets and so on [17\u201319] . However, the networks that consist of mixed nodes in 2D arrangement are rarely observed. Herein we present two compounds [Cd 2 (3-abpt)(N 3 ) 4 ] n ( 1 ) and [Cu(3-abpt) 2 (N 3 ) 2 ] ( 2 ). To the best of our knowledge, the complex 1 is the first example of 3,7-connected (3 2 ;4)(3 4 ;4 6 ;5 6 ;6 5 ) topological 2D network. The ligand 3-abpt was prepared according to the literature method [20] . Solution reaction of Cd(NO 3 ) 2 , 3-abpt and NaN 3 in a molar ratio of 1:2:2 afforded complex 1 , while hydrothermal reaction of Cu(OAc) 2 , 3-abpt and NaN 3 in a molar ratio of 2:2:1 afforded complex 2 [21] . X-ray structural analysis [22,23] revealed that complex 1 contains one crystallographically independent Cd(II) center, two azide groups and one half a 3-abpt ligand as shown in Fig. 1 . The Cd(II) ion is in an octahedral geometry, coordinated by two end-on (EO) azides, two end-to-end (EE) azides and two 3-abpt ligands. The 3-abpt ligand adopts tetradendate coordination mode and nitrogen atoms on the pyridyl rings show cis-fashion. They are connected to four Cd(II) ions through two N pyridyl and two N triazole donors. The bond distances of Cd\u2212N vary from 2.246(3) to 2.410(3) \u00c5. The dihedral angle between the pyridyl ring planes of 3-abpt is 58.10(2)\u00b0. Each Cd(II) ion is linked by 3-abpt and azide ligands to form a 2D coordination polymer. There exists a kind of three-bridged {Cd 2 N 4 } dimer made by two end-on (EO) azides and one 3-abpt ligand with the Cd\u22efCd distance of 3.4499(4) \u00c5. The 3-abpt tetradentate ligand gives rise to a 2D Cd(II)/3-abpt framework with (4, 4) grid ( Fig. S2 ). From the viewpoint of network topology, the complex 1 can be simplified as a 3, 7 two-nodal net as shown in Fig. 2 a. The center of two Cd atoms bridged by two azides and one 1,2,4-triazole ligand can be treated as a 7-connected node. The 3-abpt ligand becomes a 3-connected node. The Schafli symbol for this 3,7-connected uniform network is (3 2 ;4)(3 4 ;4 6 ;5 6 ;6 5 ), while the long vertex symbol is [3.3.3.3.4.4.4.4.4 2 .4 2 .5.5.5.5.5 2 .5 2 .6 2 .6 2 .6 2 .6 4 .6 4 ]. It is noteworthy that topology of 1 first exists in the 2D structure. The 3-abpt ligands align above the 2D sheet and protrude into the cavities of neighboring networks, but in a staggered manner to each other along the c -direction. This arrangement ultimately leads to an ABAB repeat pattern of packing layers ( Fig. 2 b). In addition, these 2D layers are interlinked via hydrogen-bonding interactions (C1\u2212H1A\u22efN6(\u2212 x , \u2212 y , \u22121/2 + z ), C3\u2013H3A\u22efN3( x , \u2212 y + 1, \u22121/2 + z)) to finally produce a 3D structure. Complex 2 is mononuclear. It contains one crystallographically independent Cu(II) center, two 3-abpt ligands and two azide groups ( Fig. 3 ). The Cu(II) ion is in a square-planar geometry and coordinated by two N pyridyl atoms from two monodentate 3-abpt ligands and two monodentate azide groups. Interestingly, except the normal Cu\u2212N6 bond with the distance of 2.046(4) \u00c5, there exist weak interactions between metal center and pyridyl N1 atom [Cu\u2212N1 (1 + x , 1/2 \u2212 y , \u22121/2 + z ) = 2.742(6) \u00c5]. Both N pyridyl atoms of 3-abpt adopt trans -fashion. The dihedral angle between the pyridyl ring planes of 3-abpt ligand is 26.93(2)\u00b0. The 3-abpt ligands are connected to Cu(II) ions, which gives rise to a 2D (4, 4) rectangle-like layer ( Fig. S3 ). In each grid constructed by four 3-abpt ligands, the Cu\u22efCu distances are 11.405(4) and 23.097(6) \u00c5. In this layer, owing to the steric hindrance of four 3-abpt ligands connected to the same metal center, they adopt cross-arrangement to form a 2D layered structure. The complex 2 also has an ABAB repeat pattern of packing layers ( Fig. S4 ), and appears to have some intra and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds including C12\u2212H12A\u22efN5, C12\u2212H12A\u22efN8, C3\u2212H3A\u22efN2, C11\u2212H11A\u22efN7, C5\u2212H5A\u22efN4 (\u2212 x \u2212 1, y , \u2212 z + 1) and some \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interactions, which further stabilizes its structure into a three-dimension supramolecular. Within the framework, the triazole ring (N3C6N4N5C7) is parallel to the pyridyl ring N1C1C2C5C4C3 at (\u2212 X , 1 \u2212 Y , 1 \u2212 Z ), and the perpendicular distance between the two ring planes is 3.468 (5) \u00c5, with the distance between ring centroids is 3.598 (2) \u00c5. Both 1 and 2 are new azide complexes based on 3-abpt ligand. However, they show different structures, one is 3, 7-connected net and the other is mononuclear. Comparing the different structures between them, we find that 3-abpt ligand acts as a tetradendate ligand in 1 and monodentate ligand in 2 . The rich coordination fashions of azide ligand are also shown in both complexes. Azide groups adopt end-on (EO) and end-to-end (EE) bridging modes in 1 , but show monodentate mode in 2 . Various coordination modes of triazole and azide ligands are the main factors to result in the difference in both compounds. On the other hand, the steric hindrance of 3-abpt ligand results in aligning them above and below the 2D sheet. Two adjacent grids are stacked parallel but in a staggered manner to each other. This arrangement ultimately leads to an ABAB repeat pattern of packing layers in both complexes. The complex 1 shows an explosive decomposition with an exothermal peak at 343 \u00b0C, corresponding to loss of 3-abpt and azide ligands (found 65.08%, calcd. 64.38%) ( Fig. S5 ). Therefore, only a small amount of azido complexes should be handled with care. We also investigated the photoluminescent property of 3-abpt ligand and cadmium complex 1 . Their emission spectrum in the solid state at room temperature is shown in Fig. S6 . It can be seen that complex 1 exhibits an intense blue photoluminescence upon photoexcitation at 360 nm. The emission peak is located at 469 nm (3-abpt ligand at 388 nm), which probably due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). This suggests that complex 1 might be used as a new blue-light-emitting material. In conclusion, we have synthesized two new azide complexes based on 3-abpt ligand under solution and hydrothermal condition. Various coordination modes of triazole and azide ligands exist in both complexes. Complex 1 shows structural evidence of an uncommon 3, 7-connected (3 2 ;4)(3 4 ;4 6 ;5 6 ;6 5 ) topological network, which also exhibits blue fluorescent emission at 469 nm. Further studies on metal-azide coordination polymers are underway in our research work.

        "abstract": "A highly efficient and simple route for the first synthesis of CF3-substututed pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinolines from quinolines, terminal alkynes, and methyl 4,4,4-trifluorobut-2-ynoate is reported. The noteworthy feature of this report is that the method involves a two-step protocol to synthesize tricyclic heterocycles in a one-pot fashion through CuI-catalyzed C\u2013H alkynylation for the formation of alkynyl-substituted 1,2-dihydroquinolines, followed by a CuII-assisted intramolecular cyclization under air. This strategy tolerates a wide range of substrates with a variety of functional groups under mild conditions, and gives the products in good to excellent yields.",

The structure of the compound was confirmed by means of elemental analysis and X-ray diffraction. The solvent extraction of U(VI) from nitric acid solution by HMEBMPPT in toluene was studied. The results show that the distribution ratio of U(VI) increased with the increasing of the aqueous phase pH. When the concentration of HMeBMPPT increases, the distribution ratio of U(VI) also increases rapidly. Meanwhile, the chemical composition of extracted complex and the mechanism of extraction were also discussed.",

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that complex  1  is an interesting 2D double-layered network constructing from eight distinct Cu(I) centers, eight \u03bc 2 -cyanides and two tetradentate  cis -btmb ligands. Complex  2  is a ladder-like coordination polymer assembled by CuCN linear chain and bidentate  trans -btmb linker. Complex  3  has a 2D wave-like network constructing from CuCN zigzag chain and V-shape dpa spacer. These coordination polymers are thermally stable up to 270\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C. They emit blue luminescence originating from ligand-centered emission.",

The two compounds exhibit a 3D structure with rectangle channels encapsulating [Me 2 NH 2 ] +  cations. The microporous structure as well as the confinement of cations inside the MOFs pores allows  1  and  2  to act as dual-functional luminescent materials to detect nitroaromatics and metal ions. The experiments show that the luminescence of sample  1  in DMF solution was quenched when the nitrobenzene (NB) content reached 2.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22122 \u00a0mol/L and concentration of Fe 3+  reached 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22124 \u00a0mol/L.",

Temperature and solvent play crucial roles in the preparation of the coordination polymers. Complexes  1 \u2013 3  were prepared in a H 2 O-DMF (6:2) solvent system at slightly different temperature (85, 100 and 120\u00a0\u00b0C). Complexes  4 \u2013 6  were prepared in different H 2 O-DMF solvents (6:3 and 8:2) and H 2 O-MeCN (3:6) solvent. These complexes possess different coordinated and/or lattice water molecules, and exhibit structural diversity and various topology nets. Complex  1  is a 2D double-layered coordination polymer. Complex  2  features a 3D porous framework with  irl  topology. Complex  3  displays a 2D double-layered network. Complex  4  is a 3D coordination polymer with  sra  topology. Complex  5  exhibits a 3D wave-like framework with  sra  topology. Complex  6  is a 3D coordination polymer with self-catenated  hxg-d  topology. 5-(3-Pyridylmethoxy)isophthalate adopts three types of coordination modes. These complexes exhibit higher thermal stability and emit strong luminescence.",

Complex  1  is a mixed-valence 1D ribbon Cu(I,II)-cyanide coordination polymer. One Cu(II) center linearly links two Cu(I) ions  via  two \u03bc 2 -CN bridges. XPS spectrum and bond valence sum (BVS) analysis have confirmed the mixed-valence characteristics. Cu(II) ion adopts a centrosymmetric square-planar geometry surrounded by two cyanides and two pyridyl groups. Cu(I) ions adopt a trigonal geometry coordinated by cyanide, imidazole group and Cl \u2212  anion. The cyanide ligand is  in situ  generated from the cleavage of acetonitrile solvent, which indicates that acetonitrile is an environmentally friend cyanating agent. The mechanism of acetonitrile  in situ  cleavage under solvothermal condition is explained. Complex  2  is a centrosymmetric mononuclear Cu(II) compound. Four equivalent Cl \u2212  anions lie on the equatorial plane. The protonated PyH 2 BIm +  cation as a monodentate ligand coordinates to Cu(II) center  via  pyridyl terminal.",

Several receptor models have been developed to apportion sources, but an intercomparison of these models had not been performed for VOCs in China. In the present study, we compared VOC sources based on chemical mass balance (CMB), UNMIX, and positive matrix factorization (PMF) models. Gasoline-related sources, petrochemical production, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were identified by all three models as the major contributors, with UNMIX and PMF producing quite similar results. The contributions of gasoline-related sources and LPG estimated by the CMB model were higher, and petrochemical emissions were lower than in the UNMIX and PMF results, possibly because the VOC profiles used in the CMB model were for fresh emissions and the profiles extracted from ambient measurements by the two-factor analysis models were \"aged\".",

To understand the chemical speciation of VOCs in Beijing, nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were measured in summer in Beijing and nearby provinces (VOCs in this work means NMHCs+OVOCs). A variation of VOC mixing ratios and chemical speciation from 2004 to 2006 was observed at an urban site in Beijing. The typical VOC species, e.g., propane, propene, and toluene, had comparable or lower mixing ratios than levels found in other cities that previously hosted the Olympic Games, while the mixing ratios for isoprene were higher. The chemical compositions of VOCs within Beijing were heavily influenced by vehicular emissions and differed from those obtained in Tianjin and Hebei Province. OVOCs were an important component, accounting for 54% and 37% in the VOC mixing ratio in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and about 40% of the OH loss rates. The main reactive VOC compounds were aldehydes and alkenes. By using isoprene chemistry and the ratio of ethylbenzene to mp-xylene, the initial mixing ratios of VOCs wereestimated.TheVOCshadsimilarvariationpatternstoambientozoneandperoxyacetyl nitrate(PAN)concentrations.Thecorrelationbetweendailymaximumozoneconcentrations and initial VOCs revealed that ozone formation was sensitive to VOCs for both urban (PekingUniversity,PKU)andrural(Yufa)sites.AreductioninNOxwouldleadtoadecrease in ozone at Yufa, but would cause increased ozone at the PKU site.",

The various VOC species showed different diurnal variations. Alkanes and alkenes had two peaks in the morning and evening, corresponding to the local traffic rush hours, indicating these species were mainly due to vehicular emissions. The morning peaks of aromatics appeared later than traffic rush hour, suggesting that the concentrations of aromatics was affected by both traffic emissions and solvent evaporation. The peak of isoprene appeared around noon, showing that the major sources of isoprene were biogenic emissions. In this work, the ratios of ethylbenzene to m, p-xylene were used as an indicator for photochemical processing. And the measured results showed that the ratios of ethylbenzene to m, p-xylene had close correlation with the ground-level ozone concentrations.",

Two of the sites, Guangzhou (GZ) and Xinken (XK), were intensive sites at which we collected multiple daily canister samples. The observations reported here provide a look at the VOC distribution, speciation, and photochemical implications in the PRD region. Alkanes constituted the largest percentage (>40%) in mixing ratios of the quantified VOCs at six sites; the exception was one major industrial site that was domi- nated by aromatics (about 52%). Highly elevated VOC lev- els occurred at GZ during two pollution episodes; however, the chemical composition of VOCs did not exhibit notice- able changes during these episodes. We calculated the OH loss rate to estimate the chemical reactivity of all VOCs. Of the anthropogenic VOCs, alkenes played a predominant role in VOC reactivity at GZ, whereas the contributions of reac- tive aromatics were more important at XK. Our preliminary analysis of the VOC correlations suggests that the ambient VOCs at GZ came directly from local sources (i.e., automo- biles); those at XK were influenced by both local emissions and transportation of air mass from upwind areas. and a population of about 45.5 million. It has been the most economically dynamic region of mainland China over the last two decades, with a per capita GDP of US$ 6583 in 2004. The average annual rate of GDP growth in the PRD from 2000 to 2004 was 13.6%, which is well above the na- tional GDP growth rate (8.6%) (China Yearbook of Statistics, 2004). Guangzhou (GZ), the capital of Guangdong Province, had the highest GDP value (US $ 496 billion) in the PRD re- gion in 2004. Dongguan (DG) is the city with the fastest growth rate GDP (18.7% per year from 2002-2006); it is a major manufacturing base for a wide range of products, including electronics, communication, paper, garments and textiles, food, shoes, and plastic.",

Biomass burning plumes are identified by using acetonitrile as tracer, and enhancement ratios (ERs) of nine VOCs species relative to acetonitrile are obtained from linear regression analysis and the source-tracer-ratio method. Enhancement ratios determined by the two different methods show good agreement for most VOCs species. Biomass burning contributions are investigated by using the source-tracer-ratio method. Biomass burning contributed 9.5%-17.7% to mixing ratios of the nine VOCs. The estimated biomass burning contributions are compared with local emission inventories. Large discrepancies are observed between our results and the estimates in two emission inventories. Though biomass burning emissions in TRACE-P inventory agree well with our results, the VOCs speciation for aromatic compounds may be not appropriate for Guangdong.",

Source apportionments of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are precursors of ground-level ozone formation, can be helpful to the further study of tropospheric ozone formation. In this study, ambient concentrations of VOCs were continuously measured with a time resolution of 30 min in August 2005 in Beijing. By using positive matrix factorization (PMF), eight sources for the selected VOC species were extracted. Gasoline-related emissions (the combination of gasoline exhaust and gas vapor), petrochemicals, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) contributed 52, 20, and 11%, respectively, to total ambient VOCs. VOC emissions from natural gas (5%), painting (5%), diesel vehicles (3%), and biogenic emissions (2%) were also identified. The gasoline-related, petrochemical, and biogenic sources were estimated to be the major contributors to ozone formation potentials in Beijing.",

        "abstract": "Ambient measurements of 108 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and halogenated hydrocarbons, were conducted from 2002 to 2003 at six sites in Beijing city. The mean mass concentration of total VOCs was 132.6 +/- 52.2 microg/m3, with alkanes, aromatics, and alkenes accounting for 35%, 22%, and 17%, respectively. The concentrations of most VOC species showed a seasonal pattern, with higher values in November, mildly lower in March, and much lower in July. In winter and spring, apparent diurnal variations of reactive compounds such as 1,3-butadiene and isoprene were observed, whereas those were not distinct in summer. The propylene equivalent concentration was used to evaluate the contribution of individual VOCs in ozone formation. Reactive olefins from anthropogenic emissions dominated the reactions with OH at each season. In summer, isoprene became the largest contributor, followed by 1-butene and propene. The source profiles in Beijing, including vehicle exhaust, gasoline vapor, painting operations, and asphalt pavement, were investigated. Based on the measurement of source profiles and ambient concentrations of VOCs in Beijing, chemical mass balance receptor model was applied to estimate contributions of several potential VOCs sources in Beijing. The results indicated that vehicle exhaust contributed on average 57.7%, followed by painting operations, gasoline vapor, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at 12.4%, 11.3%, and 5.8%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) exerts profound impacts on air quality and climate because of its high absorption cross-section over a broad range of electromagnetic spectra, but the current results on absorption enhancement of BC particles during atmospheric aging remain conflicting. Here, we quantified the aging and variation in the optical properties of BC particles under ambient conditions in Beijing, China, and Houston, United States, using a novel environmental chamber approach. BC aging exhibits two distinct stages, i.e., initial transformation from a fractal to spherical morphology with little absorption variation and subsequent growth of fully compact particles with a large absorption enhancement. The timescales to achieve complete morphology modification and an absorption amplification factor of 2.4 for BC particles are estimated to be 2.3 h and 4.6 h, respectively, in Beijing, compared with 9 h and 18 h, respectively, in Houston. Our findings indicate that BC under polluted urban environments could play an essential role in pollution development and contribute importantly to large positive radiative forcing. The variation in direct radiative forcing is dependent on the rate and timescale of BC aging, with a clear distinction between urban cities in developed and developing countries, i.e., a higher climatic impact in more polluted environments. We suggest that mediation in BC emissions achieves a cobenefit in simultaneously controlling air pollution and protecting climate, especially for developing countries.",

Atmospheric models consistently underpredict sulfate levels under diverse environmental conditions. From atmospheric measurements in two Chinese megacities and complementary laboratory experiments, we show that the aqueous oxidation of SO2 by NO2 is key to efficient sulfate formation but is only feasible under two atmospheric conditions: on fine aerosols with high relative humidity and NH3 neutralization or under cloud conditions. Under polluted environments, this SO2 oxidation process leads to large sulfate production rates and promotes formation of nitrate and organic matter on aqueous particles, exacerbating severe haze development. Effective haze mitigation is achievable by intervening in the sulfate formation process with enforced NH3 and NO2 control measures. In addition to explaining the polluted episodes currently occurring in China and during the 1952 London Fog, this sulfate production mechanism is widespread, and our results suggest a way to tackle this growing problem in China and much of the developing world.",

        "abstract": "Molecular chlorine (Cl) and nitryl chloride (ClNO) concentrations were measured using chemical ionization mass spectrometry at a rural site over the North China Plain during June 2014. High levels of daytime Cl up to \u223c450 pptv were observed. The average diurnal Cl mixing ratios showed a maximum around noon at \u223c100 pptv. ClNO exhibited a strong diurnal variation with early morning maxima reaching ppbv levels and afternoon minima sustained above 60 pptv. A moderate correlation (R = 0.31) between Cl and sulfur dioxide was observed, perhaps indicating a role for power plant emissions in the generation of the observed chlorine. We also observed a strong correlation (R = 0.83) between daytime (10:00-20:00) Cl and ClNO, which implies that both of them were formed from a similar mechanism. In addition, Cl production is likely associated with a photochemical mechanism as Cl concentrations varied with ozone (O) levels. The impact of Cl and ClNO as Cl atom sources is investigated using a photochemical box model. We estimated that the produced Cl atoms oxidized slightly more alkanes than OH radicals and enhanced the daily concentrations of peroxy radicals by 15% and the O production rate by 19%.",

        "abstract": "Light-duty gasoline vehicles have drawn public attention in China due to their significant primary emissions of particulate matter and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, little information on secondary aerosol formation from exhaust for Chinese vehicles and fuel conditions is available. In this study, chamber experiments were conducted to quantify the potential of secondary aerosol formation from the exhaust of a port fuel injection gasoline engine. The engine and fuel used are common in the Chinese market, and the fuel satisfies the China V gasoline fuel standard. Substantial secondary aerosol formation was observed during a 4-5hr simulation, which was estimated to represent more than 10days of equivalent atmospheric photo-oxidation in Beijing. As a consequence, the extreme case secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production was 426\u00b185mg/kg-fuel, with high levels of precursors and OH exposure. The low hygroscopicity of the aerosols formed inside the chamber suggests that SOA was the dominant chemical composition. Fourteen percent of SOA measured in the chamber experiments could be explained through the oxidation of speciated single-ring aromatics. Unspeciated precursors, such as intermediate-volatility organic compounds and semi-volatile organic compounds, might be significant for SOA formation from gasoline VOCs. We concluded that reductions of emissions of aerosol precursor gases from vehicles are essential to mediate pollution in China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Measurements of ageing and hygroscopicity variation of black carbon (BC) particles in Beijing were conducted using a 1.2  m 3  quasi-atmospheric aerosol evolution study (QUALITY) chamber, which consisted of a bottom flow chamber through which ambient air was pulled continuously and an upper reaction chamber where ageing of BC particles occurred. Within the reaction chamber, transmission of the solar ultraviolet irradiation was approximately 50\u201360  %, wall loss of primary gaseous pollutants was negligible, and BC exhibited a half-lifetime of about 3\u20137  h. Typically, equilibrium for the primary gases, temperature and relative humidity between the reaction chamber and ambient air was established within 1  h. Rapid growth of BC particles occurred, with an average total growth of 77  \u00b1  33  nm and average growth rate of 26  \u00b1  11  nm  h \u22121 . Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) accounted for more than 90  % of the coating mass. The O  \u2215  C ratio of SOA was 0.5, lower than the ambient level. The hygroscopic growth factor of BC particles decreased slightly with an initial thin coating layer because of BC reconstruction, but subsequently increased to 1.06\u20131.08 upon further ageing. The  \u03ba  (kappa) values for BC particles and coating materials were calculated as 0.035 and 0.040 at the subsaturation and supersaturation conditions, respectively, indicating low hygroscopicity of coated SOA on BC particles. Hence, our results indicate that initial photochemical ageing of BC particles leads to considerable modifications to morphology and optical properties but does not appreciably alter the particle hygroscopicity in Beijing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A chemical box model was used to study nitrate radical (NO 3 ), dinitrogen pentoxide (N 2 O 5 ) and nitryl chloride (ClNO 2 ) in a rural site during the Campaign of Air Quality Research in Beijing 2006 (CAREBeijing-2006). The model was based on regional atmospheric chemistry mechanism version 2 (RACM2) with the heterogeneous uptake of N 2 O 5  and the simplified chloride radical (Cl) chemistry mechanism. A high production rate of NO 3  with a mean value of 0.8\u00a0ppbv/h and low mixing ratios of NO 3  and N 2 O 5  (peak values of 17 pptv and 480 pptv, respectively) existed in this site. Budget analysis showed that NO emission suppressed the NO 3  chemistry at the surface layer, the reaction of NO 3  with VOCs made a similar contribution to NO 3  loss as N 2 O 5  heterogeneous uptake. The NO 3  chemistry was predominantly controlled by isoprene, and NO 3  oxidation produced organic nitrate with a mean value of 0.06\u00a0ppbv/h during nighttime. The organic nitrate production initiated by NO 3  was equal to that initiated by OH, implying the importance of nighttime chemistry for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. We confirmed that the N 2 O 5  heterogeneous reaction accounted for nighttime particle NO 3  \u2212  enhancement, with a large day to day variability, and made less of a contribution to NOx loss compared to that of OH reacting with NO 2 . Additionally, abundant ClNO 2 , up to 5.0 ppbv, was formed by N 2 O 5  heterogeneous uptake. ClNO 2  was sustained at a high level until noon in spite of the gradually increasing photolysis of ClNO 2  after sunrise. Chlorine activation caused by N 2 O 5  heterogeneous uptake increased primary ROx formation by 5% and accounted for 8% of the net ozone production enhancement in the morning.",

        "abstract": "Gasoline vehicles greatly contribute importantly to urban particulate matter (PM) pollution. Gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, known as their higher fuel efficiency than that of port fuel injection (PFI) engines, have been increasingly employed in new gasoline vehicles. However, the impact of this trend on air quality is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated both primary emissions and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from GDI and PFI vehicles under urban-like condition, using combined approaches involving chassis dynamometer measurement and environmental chamber simulation. The PFI vehicle emits slightly more volatile organic compounds, e.g., benzene and toluene, whereas the GDI vehicle emits more particulate components, e.g., the total PM, elemental carbon, primary organic aerosols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Strikingly, a much higher SOA production (by a factor of approximately 2.7) is found from the exhaust of the GDI vehicle than that of the PFI vehicle under the same conditions. More importantly, the higher SOA production found in the GDI vehicle exhaust occurs concurrently with lower concentrations of traditional SOA precursors, e.g., benzene and toluene, indicating a greater contribution of intermediate volatility organic compounds and semivolatile organic compounds in the GDI vehicle exhaust to the SOA formation. Our results highlight the considerable potential contribution of GDI vehicles to urban air pollution in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Gasoline vehicles significantly contribute to urban particulatematter (PM) pollution. Gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, known fortheir higher fuel efficiency than that of port fuel injection (PFI) engines,have been increasingly employed in new gasoline vehicles. However, the impactof this trend on air quality is still poorly understood. Here, weinvestigated both primary emissions and secondary organic aerosol (SOA)formation from a GDI and a PFI vehicle under an urban-like driving condition,using combined approaches involving chassis dynamometer measurements andan environmental chamber simulation. The PFI vehicle emits slightly morevolatile organic compounds, e.g., benzene and toluene, whereas the GDIvehicle emits more particulate components, e.g., total PM, elementalcarbon, primary organic aerosols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.Strikingly, we found a much higher SOA production (by a factor ofapproximately 2.7) from the exhaust of the GDI vehicle than that of the PFIvehicle under the same conditions. More importantly, the higher SOAproduction found in the GDI vehicle exhaust occurs concurrently with lowerconcentrations of traditional SOA precursors, e.g., benzene and toluene,indicating a greater contribution of intermediate volatility organiccompounds and semi-volatile organic compounds in the GDI vehicle exhaust tothe SOA formation. Our results highlight the considerable potentialcontribution of GDI vehicles to urban air pollution in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the troposphere, ozone is a harmful gas compound to both human health and vegetation. Ozone is produced from the reaction of NO x  ( NO\u202f+\u202fNO 2 ) and VOCs (volatile organic compounds) with light. Due to the highly nonlinear relationships between ozone and its precursors, proper ozone mitigation relies on the knowledge of chemical mechanisms. In this study, an observation-based method is used to simulate ozone formation and elucidate its controlling factors for a rural site on the North China Plain. The instantaneous ozone production rate is calculated utilizing a box model using the dataset obtained from the Wangdu campaign. First, the model was operated in a time-dependent mode to calculate the ozone production rate at each time stamp. The calculated ozone formation rate showed a diurnal average maximum value of 17\u202fppbv/h (1-h diurnal averaged). The contribution of individual peroxy radicals to ozone production was analyzed. In addition, the functional dependence of calculated P(O 3 ) reveals that ozone production was in a NO x -limited regime during the campaign. Furthermore, the missing peroxy radical source will further extend NO x -limited conditions to earlier in the day, making NO x  limitation dominate more of a day than the current chemical model predicts. Finally, a multiple scenarios mode, also known as EKMA (empirical kinetic modeling approach), was used to simulate the response of P(O 3 ) to the imaginary change in precursor concentrations. We found that ozone production was in the NO x -limited region. However, the use of NO 2  measured by the molybdenum converter and/or the absence of a peroxy radical source in the current chemical model could over-emphasize the VOC-limited effect on ozone production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  During the period 2012\u20132015, the photolysis frequencies were measured at the Peking University site (PKUERS), a representative site of urban Beijing. We present a study of the effects of aerosols on two key photolysis frequencies, j(O 1 D) and j(NO 2 ). Both j(O 1 D) and j(NO 2 ) display significant dependence on AOD with a nonlinear negative correlation. With the increase in AOD, the slopes of photolysis frequencies vs AOD decrease, which indicates that the capacity of aerosols to reduce the actinic flux decreases with AOD. In addition, the slopes are equal to 4.21\u20136.93\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22126 \u2009s \u22121  and 3.20\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22123 \u2009s \u22121  per AOD unit for j(O 1 D) and j(NO 2 ) respectively at SZA of 60\u00b0, both of which are larger than those observed in the Mediterranean. This indicates that the aerosols in urban Beijing have a stronger extinction on actinic flux than absorptive dust aerosols in the Mediterranean. Since the photolysis frequencies strongly depended on the AOD and the solar zenith angle (SZA), we established a parametric equation to quantitatively evaluate the effect of aerosols on photolysis frequencies in Beijing. According to the parametric equation, aerosols lead to a decrease in j(NO 2 ) by 24.2\u2009% and 30.4\u2009% for summer and winter, respectively, and the corresponding decrease in j(O 1 D) by 27.3\u2009% and 32.6\u2009% respectively, compared to an aerosol-free atmosphere. Based on an observation campaign in August 2012, we used the photochemical box model to simulate the ozone production rate (P(O 3 )). The simulation results shows that the monthly average net ozone production rate is reduced by up to 25\u2009% due to the light extinction of aerosols. Through further in-depth analysis, it was found that particulate matter concentrations maintain high level under the condition of high concentrations of ozone precursors (VOCs and NO x ), which inhibits the production of ozone to a large extent. This phenomenon implies a negative feedback mechanism in the atmospheric environment of urban Beijing.",

        "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play important roles in the atmosphere via three main pathways: photochemical ozone formation, secondary organic aerosol production, and direct toxicity to humans. Few studies have integrated these effects to prioritize control measures for VOCs sources. In this study, we developed a multi-effects evaluation methodology based on updated emission inventories and source profiles, by combining the ozone formation potential (OFP), secondary organic aerosol potential (SOAP), and VOC toxicity data. We derived species-specific emission inventories for 152 sources. The OFPs, SOAPs, and toxicity of each source were estimated, the contribution and sharing of source to each of these adverse effects were calculated. Weightings were given to the three adverse effects by expert scoring, and then the integrated effect was determined. Taking 2012 as the base year, solvent use and industrial process were found to be the most important anthropogenic sources, accounting for 24.2% and 23.1% of the integrated effect, respectively, followed by biomass burning, transportation, and fossil fuel combustion, each had a similar contribution ranging from 16.7% to 18.6%. The top five industrial sources, including plastic products, rubber products, chemical fiber products, the chemical industry, and oil refining, accounted for nearly 70.0% of industrial emissions. Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Guangdong were the five provinces contributing the largest integrated effects. For the VOC species from emissions showed the largest contributions were styrene, toluene, ethylene, benzene, and m/p-xylene.",

        "abstract": "Carbonyl compounds are important intermediates in atmospheric photochemistry, but their primary sources are still not understood well. In this work, carbonyls, hydrocarbons, and alkyl nitrates were continuously measured during November 2011 at a rural site in the Yangtze River Delta region of China. Mixing ratios of carbonyls and hydrocarbons showed large fluctuations during the entire measurement. The average level for total measured volatile organic compounds during the pollution episode from 25th to 27th November, 2011 was 91.6ppb, about 7 times the value for the clean period of 7th-8th, November, 2011. To preliminarily identify toluene sources at this site, the emission ratio of toluene to benzene (T/B) during the pollution episode was determined based on photochemical ages derived from the relationship of alkyl nitrates to their parent alkanes. The calculated T/B was 5.8ppb/ppb, significantly higher than the values of 0.2-1.7ppb/ppb for vehicular exhaust and other combustion sources, indicating the dominant influence of industrial emissions on ambient toluene. The contributions of industrial sources to ambient carbonyls were then calculated using a multiple linear regression fit model that used toluene and alkyl nitrates as respective tracers for industrial emission and secondary production. During the pollution episode, 18.5%, 69.0%, and 52.9% of measured formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone were considered to be attributable to industrial emissions. The emission ratios relative to toluene for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone were determined to be 0.10, 0.20 and 0.40ppb/ppb, respectively. More research on industrial carbonyl emission characteristics is needed to understand carbonyl sources better.",

To better understand the formation of the regional O problem in the North China Plain (NCP), intensive field measurements of O and related parameters were conducted at a rural site downwind of Ji'nan, the capital city of Shandong province, in the summer of 2013. Markedly severe O pollution was recorded, with the O mixing ratios exceeding the Chinese national ambient air quality standard on 28\u202fdays (a frequency of 78%) and with a maximum hourly value of 198 ppbv. Extensive regional transport of well-processed urban plumes to the site was identified. An observation-constrained chemical box model was deployed to evaluate in situ photochemical O production on two episodes. The results show that the in situ formation accounted for approximately 46% of the observed O accumulation, while the remainder (~54%) was contributed by regional transport of the O-laden urban plumes. The in situ ozone production was in a mixed controlled regime that reducing either NOx or VOCs would lead to a reduction of ozone formation. Biogenic VOCs played an important role in the local ozone formation. This study demonstrates the significant mixed effects of both anthropogenic pollution from urban zones and biogenic emission in rural areas on the regional O pollution in the NCP region, and may have general applicability in facilitating the understanding of the formation of secondary pollution over China.",

        "abstract": "In order to obtain VOCs emission characteristics and emission factors from vehicle, a tunnel experiment was conducted in the Fu Gui Mountain Tunnel in Nanjing, China. The tunnel is located in the middle of city, with total length of 480m and speed limit of 50km/h. The studied vehicle fleet was composed of 87% light duty vehicles and 13% heavy duty vehicles (liquefied natural gas bus, LNGB). The emerging radio frequency identification (RFID) technology was used to divide fine vehicles type including China I, China II, China III, China IV, China V and LNGB. Ambient air samples (4-h averages) were collected inside the tunnel using 3.2L stainless-steel canisters. Samples collected in the canisters were analyzed for 97 individual VOCs using high-resolution GC-MS in the laboratory. The average tunnel emission factor for the collective light-duty vehicles was 160.79\u00b165.94mg/(km\u2217veh), and for the China I, China II, China III, China IV and China V vehicles, it was 632.07\u00b1259.44, 450.35\u00b1184.85, 205.42\u00b184.32, 118.51\u00b148.65, and 110.61\u00b145.4mg/(km\u2217veh), respectively. The average emission factor for heavy-duty vehicles was 358.02\u00b1124.86mg/(km\u2217veh). Ethane, isopentane, propane, ethylene, toluene, propylene and 2,3-dimethylbutane were the most common VOC species in vehicle emissions. The total O formation potential was 373.88mg\u2217O/(km\u2217veh) in the tunnel. Ethylene, propylene, m/p-xylene, toluene, and isopentane were the largest contributors to O production. Compared with previous studies, fuel quality increased from China II-FQ to China IV-FQ levels, while the BTEX emission levels exhibited a decreasing trend.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have an important influence on the formation of photochemical smog and secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. In this paper, we investigated 104 VOCs in Heshan from 22 October to 22 November 2014 to identify the sources and abatement mechanisms of VOCs in southern China. Weather conditions, species correlations, daytime and nighttime abatement mechanisms, secondary pollutant transformations, air-mass origins and source apportionments were studied. During the observation period, the average concentration of VOCs in the atmosphere of Heshan was 61.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f35.5\u202fppbv, and the wind speed played a pivotal role in the diffusion and dilution of VOCs. The study on the rates of OH, O 3  and NO 3  radicals found that alkenes, aromatics, hydrocarbons and carbonyl compounds were the most active volatile organic compounds in Heshan. For alkanes, alkynes, and aromatics, removal is determined by their reactions with OH radicals. For highly reactive alkenes and styrene, nighttime removal via O 3  and NO 3  radicals was also significant. The backward-trajectory cluster analysis of air masses indicated that pollution mainly derived from the east-northeast. The paint solvent usage, paint solvent usage\u00a0+\u00a0liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) usage, biomass burning, coal burning\u00a0+\u00a0industrial combustion sources, gasoline vehicle exhaust, diesel vehicle exhaust, industrial sources, and fuel evaporation (gasoline) contributed 11%, 22%, 13%, 17%, 12%, 8%, 11%, and 6% to VOCs during the observation period, respectively.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive field campaign was carried out in summer 2014 in Wangdu, located in the North China Plain. A month of continuous OH, HO2 and RO2 measurements was achieved. Observations of radicals by the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique revealed daily maximum concentrations between (5-15)\u00d7106 cm-3, (3-14) \u00d7108 cm-3 and (3-15) \u00d7108 cm-3 for OH, HO2 and RO2, respectively. Measured OH reactivities (inverse OH lifetime) were 10 to 20 s-1 during daytime. The chemical box model RACM 2, including the Leuven isoprene mechanism (LIM), was used to interpret the observed radical concentrations. As in previous field campaigns in China, modeled and measured OH concentrations agree for NO mixing ratios higher than 1 ppbv, but systematic discrepancies are observed in the afternoon for NO mixing ratios of less than 300 pptv (the model-measurement ratio is between 1.4 and 2 in this case). If additional OH recycling equivalent to 100 pptv NO is assumed, the model is capable of reproducing the observed OH, HO2 and RO2 concentrations for conditions of high volatile organic compound (VOC) and low NOx concentrations. For HO2, good agreement is found between modeled and observed concentrations during day and night. In the case of RO2, the agreement between model calculations and measurements is good in the late afternoon when NO concentrations are below 0.3 ppbv. A significant model underprediction of RO2 by a factor of 3 to 5 is found in the morning at NO concentrations higher than 1 ppbv, which can be explained by a missing RO2 source of 2 ppbvh-1. As a consequence, the model underpredicts the photochemical net ozone production by 20 ppbv per day, which is a significant portion of the daily integrated ozone production (110 ppbv) derived from the measured HO2 and RO2. The additional RO2 production from the photolysis of ClNO2 and missing reactivity can explain about 10% and 20% of the discrepancy, respectively. The underprediction of the photochemical ozone production at high NOx found in this study is consistent with the results from other field campaigns in urban environments, which underlines the need for better understanding of the peroxy radical chemistry for high NOx conditions. \u00a9 Author(s) 2017.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Source profiles are essential for quantifying the role of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in air pollution. This study compiled a database of VOC source profiles in China, with 75 species drawn from five major categories: transportation, solvent use, biomass burning, fossil fuel burning, and industrial processes. Source profiles were updated for diesel vehicles, biomass burning, and residential coal burning by measuring both hydrocarbons and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), while other source profiles were derived from the available literature. The OVOCs contributed 53.8% of total VOCs in the profiles of heavy - duty diesel vehicle exhaust and 12.4%\u201346.3% in biomass and residential coal burning, which indicated the importance of primary OVOCs emissions from combustion-related sources. Taking the national emission inventory from 2008 as an example, we established an approach for assigning source profiles to develop a speciation-specific VOC and OVOC emission inventory. The results showed that aromatics contributed 30% of the total 26\u00a0Tg VOCs, followed by alkanes (24%), alkenes (19%) and OVOCs (12%). Aromatics (7.9\u00a0Tg) were much higher than in previous results (1.1\u00a0Tg and 3.4\u00a0Tg), while OVOCs (3.1\u00a0Tg) were comparable with the 3.3\u00a0Tg and 4.3\u00a0Tg reported in studies using profiles from the US. The current emission inventories were built based on emission factors from non-methane hydrocarbon measurements, and therefore the proportions from OVOC emissions was neglected, leading to up to 30% underestimation of total VOC emissions. As a result, there is a need to deploy appropriate emission factors and source profiles that include OVOC measurements to reduce the uncertainty of estimated emissions and chemical reactivity potential.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Ammonia (NH 3 ) can interact in the atmosphere with other trace chemical species, which can lead to detrimental environmental consequences, such as the formation of fine particulates and ultimately global climate change. China is a major agricultural country, and livestock numbers and nitrogen fertilizer use have increased drastically since 1978, following the rapid economic and industrial development experienced by the country. In this study, comprehensive NH 3  emissions inventories were compiled for China for 1980\u20132012. In a previous study, we parameterized emissions factors (EFs) considering ambient temperature, soil acidity, and the method and rate of fertilizer application. In this study, we refined these EFs by adding the effects of wind speed and new data from field experiments of NH 3  flux in cropland in northern China. We found that total NH 3  emissions in China increased from 5.9 to 11.1 Tg from 1980 to 1996, and then decreased to 9.7 Tg in 2012. The two major contributors were livestock manure and synthetic fertilizer application, which contributed 80\u201390 % of the total emissions. Emissions from livestock manure rose from 2.86 Tg (1980) to 6.16 Tg (2005), and then decreased to 5.0 Tg (2012); beef cattle were the largest source followed by laying hens and pigs. The remarkable downward trend in livestock emissions that occurred in 2007 was attributed to a decrease in the numbers of various livestock animals, including beef cattle, goats, and sheep. Meanwhile, emissions from synthetic fertilizer ranged from 2.1 Tg (1980) to 4.7 Tg (1996), and then declined to 2.8 Tg (2012). Urea and ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) dominated this category of emissions, and a decline in ABC application led to the decrease in emissions that took place from the mid-1990s onwards. High emissions were concentrated in eastern and southwestern China. Seasonally, peak NH 3  emissions occurred in spring and summer. The inventories had a monthly temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 1000 m, and thus are suitable for global and regional air-quality modeling.",

We demonstrate a periodic cycle of PM episodes in Beijing that is governed by meteorological conditions and characterized by two distinct aerosol formation processes of nucleation and growth, but with a small contribution from primary emissions and regional transport of particles. Nucleation consistently precedes a polluted period, producing a high number concentration of nano-sized particles under clean conditions. Accumulation of the particle mass concentration exceeding several hundred micrograms per cubic meter is accompanied by a continuous size growth from the nucleation-mode particles over multiple days to yield numerous larger particles, distinctive from the aerosol formation typically observed in other regions worldwide. The particle compositions in Beijing, on the other hand, exhibit a similarity to those commonly measured in many global areas, consistent with the chemical constituents dominated by secondary aerosol formation. Our results highlight that regulatory controls of gaseous emissions for volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides from local transportation and sulfur dioxide from regional industrial sources represent the key steps to reduce the urban PM level in China.",

In one of these regions, the Pearl River Delta, the variations of ground-level ozone and its precursors were investigated. Overall, the ambient concentrations of NO(2) increased quickly between 1995 and 1996, but then slightly decreased due to stringent nitrogen oxide (NO(x)) emission controls. Nonetheless, ambient NO(2) levels in the Pearl River Delta remained high. The regional average concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were 290 ppbC in summer and 190 ppbC in autumn. Local emissions and long-distance transportation of pollutants play important roles in the regional distribution of VOCs. Ambient O(3) production is significant in urban areas and also downwind of cities. The relative incremental reactivities (RIRs), determined by an observation-based model, showed that ground-level ozone formation in the Guangzhou urban area is generally limited by the concentrations of VOCs, but there are also measurable impacts of NO(x).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed in the gas phase and total suspended particulate (TSP) from summer 2014 to spring 2015 in Taiyuan, northern China. Taiyuan is an area with some of the highest atmospheric PAH levels in the world, and the total PAHs was highest in winter, followed by autumn, spring and summer. Low air temperature and a southern wind with low speed often led to higher PAH levels in Taiyuan. Although less than a half fraction, the benzo[ a ]pyrene equivalent concentration (BEQ) of particulate PAHs was almost equal to that of the total PAHs. Four sources, coal combustion, vehicle emissions, coke processing and biomass burning, were determined by positive matrix factorization (PMF), with contributions of 41.36%, 24.74%, 19.71% and 14.18% to the total PAHs in Taiyuan, respectively. Compared with the total PAHs, the particulate PAH solution underestimated the contribution of the coke processing, especially in winter, and overestimated vehicle emissions. The coke processing had a greater contribution to atmospheric PAHs with a southern wind at low speeds in winter in Taiyuan. Ultimately, the coke plants distributed in the Taiyuan-Linfen-Yuncheng basin should receive greater attention for air quality improvement in Taiyuan.",

        "abstract": "Over the past fifty years, considerable efforts have been devoted to measuring the concentration and chemical speciation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ambient air and emissions. Recently, it has become possible to directly determine the overall effect of atmospheric trace gases on the oxidant hydroxyl radicals (OH), by measuring OH reactivity (OH loss frequency). Quantifying total OH reactivity is one way to characterize the roles of VOCs in formation of ground-level ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Approaches for measuring total OH reactivity in both emissions and ambient air have been progressing and have been applied in a wide range of studies. Here we evaluate the main techniques used to measure OH reactivity, including two methods directly measuring OH decay and one comparative reactivity method (CRM), and summarize the existing experimental and modeling studies. Total OH reactivity varies significantly on spatial, diurnal, seasonal and vertical bases. Comparison with individually detected OH sinks often reveals a significant missing reactivity, ranging from 20% to over 80% in some environments. Missing reactivity has also been determined in most source emission studies. These source measurements, as well as numerical models, have indicated that both undetected primary emissions and unmeasured secondary products could contribute to missing reactivity. A quantitative understanding of total OH reactivity of various sources and ambient environments will enhance our understanding of the suite of compounds found in emissions as well as chemical processes, and will also provide an opportunity for the improvement of atmospheric chemical mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Atmospheric transport of black carbon (BC) from surrounding areas has been shown to impact the Tibetan environment, and clarifying the geographical source and receptor regions is crucial for providing guidance for mitigation actions. In this study, 10 trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sampled across Tibet are chosen as proxies to diagnose source regions and related transport of pollutants to Tibet. The levels of these VOCs in Tibet are higher than those in the Arctic and Antarctic regions but much lower than those observed at many remote and background sites in Asia. The highest VOC level is observed in the eastern region, followed by the southern region and the northern region. A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model found that three factors\u2014industry, biomass burning, and traffic\u2014present different spatial distributions, which indicates that different zones of Tibet are influenced by different VOC sources. The average age of the air masses in the northern and eastern regions is estimated to be 3.5 and 2.8 days using the ratio of toluene to benzene, respectively, which indicates the foreign transport of VOC species to those regions. Back-trajectory analyses show that the Afghanistan-Pakistan-Tajikistan region, Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), and Meghalaya-Myanmar region could transport industrial VOCs to different zones of Tibet from west to east. The agricultural bases in northern India could transport biomass burning-related VOCs to the middle-northern and eastern zones of Tibet. High traffic along the unique national roads in Tibet is associated with emissions from local sources and neighboring areas. Our study proposes international joint-control efforts and targeted actions to mitigate the climatic changes and effects associated with VOCs in Tibet, which is a climate sensitive region and an important source of global water.",

        "abstract": "In many regions of China, very rapid economic growth has been accompanied by air pollution caused by vehicle emissions. In one of these regions, the Pearl River Delta, the variations of ground-level ozone and its precursors were investigated. Overall, the ambient concentrations of NO 2 increased quickly between 1995 and 1996, but then slightly decreased due to stringent nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emission controls. Nonetheless, ambient NO 2 levels in the Pearl River Delta remained high. The regional average concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were 290 ppbC in summer and 190 ppbC in autumn. Local emissions and long-distance transportation of pollutants play important roles in the regional distribution of VOCs. Ambient O 3 production is significant in urban areas and also downwind of cities. The relative incremental reactivities (RIRs), determined by an observation-based model, showed that ground-level ozone formation in the Guangzhou urban area is generally limited by the concentrations of VOCs, but there are also measurable impacts of NO x .

Knowledge of the sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is essential for ozone chemistry. In this work, a speciated VOC emission inventory was established on the basis of updated emissions and local VOC source profiles. The top 10 species, in terms of ozone formation potentials (OFPs), consisted of isoprene, mp-xylene, toluene, ethylene, propene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 2-methyl-2-butene, 1-butene, and alpha-pinene. These species contributed only 35.9% to VOCs emissions but accounted for 64.1% of the OFP in the region. The spatial patterns of the VOC source inventory agreed well with city-based source apportionment results, especially for vehicle emissions and industry plus VOC product-related emissions. Mapping of the OFPs and measured ozone concentrations indicated that the formation of higher ozone in the south and southeast of the PRD region differed from that in the Conghua area, a remote area in the north of the PRD. We recommend that the priorities for the control of VOC sources include motorcycles, gasoline vehicles, and solvent use because of their larger OFP contributions.",

        "abstract": "The dicarbonyls glyoxal (Gly) and methylglyoxal (Mgly) are key tracers for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere, but their atmospheric chemistry in remote forest environments is not well understood. A study was carried out during Jul. 31\u2013Nov. 5 of 2016 at the summit of Mt. Tianjing (1690 m.a.s.l.), a remote mountaintop site in southern China, to measure the levels of Gly and Mgly and explore their sources and fate. During the study period, the average mixing ratios of Gly and Mgly were 509 \u00b1 31 pptv and 340 \u00b1 32 pptv, respectively, with the Gly/Mgly ratios averaging 1.8 \u00b1 0.2. Both the dicarbonyl concentrations and the Gly/Mgly ratios were significantly higher than those observed in other background sites. Production yield calculations and meteorological data analysis indicate that high levels of Gly and Mgly observed at the study site were largely a combined result of rapid in-situ formation and regional transport by prevailing winds. On average, in-situ formation from precursors is estimated to account for 67% of the observed Mgly and about 9% of the observed Gly. There were significant changes in Gly and Mgly mixing ratios among different time periods when air masses from different source regions dominated, indicating contribution of regional transport to the observed dicarbonyl mixing ratios at the study site. Biogenic emissions in eastern China and anthropogenic emissions in the Pearl River Delta region were the two main sources responsible for the dicarbonyls observed at the site during most of the sampling period, but large-scale biomass burning in central China was also important in the late autumn, as supported by a backward trajectory analysis of fire spot data and the identification of biomass burning tracers. This study provides insights into the background atmospheric chemistry and the impact of biogenic and anthropogenic sources on the dicarbonyls speciation. \u00a9 2019",

        "abstract": "Ningbo is a highly industrialized city in the coastal area of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China. Large emissions and transport of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) may contribute to regional ozone (O) and particulate matter (PM) pollution; however, the concentrations and sources of ambient NMHCs have not yet been investigated in Ningbo. In this study, ambient NMHCs were measured at two residential (SZ and CX) and two industrial (ZH and BL) sites and one suburban (XS) site over ten consecutive days in each season (10-20 December 2012 in winter, 14-23 April 2013 in spring, 15-24 July 2013 in summer, 22-31 October 2013, in autumn). A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model using multiple site data was deployed to explore the source contributions and their spatial and seasonal characteristics. The measurement results showed obvious seasonal variations in ambient NMHC concentrations (ranging from 17.89-28.48ppbv); chemical compositions were similar among the five sampling sites. PMF analysis showed that the petrochemical industry was the largest contributor (an average of 35.64%) to ambient NMHCs, while contributions of smaller sources (i.e., chemical and paint industries [14.34%], fuel and tank evaporation [16.02%], and residential solvent usage [7.24%]) showed spatial variations. Liquefied petroleum gas and fuel and tank evaporation contributed more in summer and autumn, while the contribution of the chemical and paint industries was greater in spring and winter. An evaluation of the ozone formation potential and secondary organic aerosol potential suggested that petrochemical and solvent-related sources were key parameters in mitigation of secondary pollutant formation. Seasonal variations in source contributions should be considered when formulating an effective NMHC abatement strategy.",

Species-specified VOC emissions, source contributions, and spatial distributions are determined based on regional-scale gridded measurements between September 2008 to December 2009 in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. The most prevalent anthropogenic species in the PRD was toluene estimated by the box model to be annual emissions of 167.8\u2009\u00b1\u2009100.5 Gg, followed by m,p-xylene (68.0\u2009\u00b1\u200945.0 Gg), i-pentane (49.2\u2009\u00b1\u200940.0 Gg), ethene (47.6\u2009\u00b1\u200927.6 Gg), n-butane (47.5\u2009\u00b1\u200940.7 Gg), and benzene (46.8\u2009\u00b1\u200929.0 Gg). Alkanes such as propane, i-butane, and n-pentane were 2-8 times higher in box model than emission inventories (EI). Species with fewer emissions were highly variable between EI and box model results. Hotspots of VOC emissions were identified in southwestern PRD and port areas, which were not reflected by bottom-up EI. This suggests more research is needed for VOC emissions in the EI, especially for fuel evaporation, industrial operations and marine vessels. The species-specified top-down method can help improve the quality of these emission inventories.",

        "abstract": "This study employs a mass balance technique-box model to calculate the biogenic isoprene emissions based on the ground-level measurements between October 2009 and September 2010 in Beijing. The annual magnitude, monthly variations and diurnal patterns of isoprene emissions are estimated. The annual emissions of isoprene were estimated to be 23.2Gg with an uncertainty of 120%. This falls within the range of previous emission inventories (EI; 3.8Gg to 36.3Gg between 1990 and 2010). Strong isoprene emissions were observed between May and September. The biggest difference was the isoprene emissions in May, with contributions of 23.3% to total annual emissions using box model estimates compared with 3.7% in EI. The diurnal profiles of isoprene emissions estimated in this study were generally similar to those in the EI, with the highest emissions occurring during mid-day (11:00-13:00). However, obvious differences were found for the growth rates and decreasing rates of isoprene emissions in the morning and afternoon respectively. Compared to anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the isoprene emissions contributed half (49.5%) of the total ozone formation potential (OFP) at 13:00 in August, which highlights the importance of isoprene in ozone formation. This study helps bound the isoprene emissions estimated by EI despite the inherent large uncertainty.",

        "title": "Emission inventory of semi-volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds and theireffectson SOA over the Pearl River Delta region",
        "abstract": "Abstract.  Semi-volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds (S/IVOCs) are considered as critical precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which is an important component of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ). However, the knowledge on the contributions of S/IVOCs to SOA is still poorly understood in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, southern China. Therefore, in this study, an emission inventory of S/IVOCs in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region was developed for the first time for the year 2010. The S/IVOCs emission was calculated based on a parameterization method involving the emissions factors of POA (primary organic aerosol), emission ratios of S/IVOCs to POA, and domestic activity data. The total emission of S/IVOCs was estimated to be 323.4\u2009Gg, with major emissions from central cities in PRD, i.e., Guangzhou, Foshan, and Shenzhen. On-road mobile sources and industries were the two major contributors of S/IVOC emissions, with contributions of ~\u200942\u2009% and ~\u200935\u2009%, respectively. Furthermore, uncertainties of the emission inventory were evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation. The uncertainties ranged from \u221279\u2009% to 229\u2009%, which could be mainly attributed to mass fractions of OC (organic compound) to PM 2.5  from on-road mobile emissions and emission ratios of IVOCs/POA. The developed S/IVOC emission inventory was further incorporated into the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model with a volatility basis-set (VBS) approach to improve the performance of SOA simulation and to evaluate the influence of S/IVOCs on SOA formation at a receptor site (Wan Qing Sha (WQS) site) of PRD. The following results could be obtained: (1) The model could resolve about 34\u2009% on average of observed SOA concentrations at WQS after considering the emissions of S/IVOCs, and 18\u2009%\u201377\u2009% with the uncertainties of the S/IVOC emission inventory considered. (2) The simulated SOA over the PRD region was increased by 161\u2009% with the input of S/IVOC emissions, and it could be decreased to 126\u2009% after the reaction coefficient of S/IVOCs with OH radical was improved. (3) Among all anthropogenic sources of S/IVOCs, industrial emission was the most significant contributor of S/IVOCs for SOA formation, followed by on-road mobile, dust, biomass burning, residential, and off-road mobile emissions. Overall, this study firstly quantified emissions of S/IVOCs and evaluated their roles in SOA formation over PRD, which contribute towards significantly improving SOA simulation and better understanding of SOA formation mechanisms in PRD and other regions in China.",

        "abstract": "Emissions from burning major agricultural residue were measured through laboratory simulations using a self-designed dilution chamber system. Emission factors of CO2, CO, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), PM10, PM2.5, OC and EC in PM2.5 were measured for burning rice straw in flaming and smoldering combustion, and for burning of sugarcane leaves. NMHCs emitted from crop straw open burning were dominated by C2 hydrocarbons (ethene, ethane, ethyne), contributing (53.4\u00b14.6)% in volume in rice straw burning emissions and 41.8% in sugarcane burning emissions, respectively. Acetone and aldehyde were major OVOCs species in open straw burning emissions. A survey was conducted to determine the fraction of field crop biomass burned during harvesting season and the amounts of household firewood and crop residue consumption in 2008. Information obtained from the survey, together with measured EFs for field burning of rice straw and sugarcane, and EFs from literatures for field burning of other agricultural residues, biofuel combustion and forest fires, were used in developing the source inventories of carbonaceous pollutants in the PRD region. The annual emissions of CO, VOCs (including NMHCs and OVOCs), NOx, PM2.5, OC and EC from burning biomass were estimated to be 186.38, 15.94, 4.93, 15.56, 7.10, 2.25kt in the year 2008, respectively. These estimates are lower than previously published estimates by 23-63%. Open burning patterns (flaming and smoldering) and rural biofuel use contribute to the differences. Field burning ofstraw contributed mainly to VOCs, PM2.5 and OC emissions while the residential sector was the dominant source of EC, CO and NOx. The contributions of biomass burning to entire PRD emissions are estimated as 3.37-6.53%, respectively, for PM, and 1.82-3.17%, respectively, for VOCs, and 0.52-2.77%, respectively, for NOx. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is one of the most industrialized, urbanized and populated regions in China, and thus has been long suffering from severe air pollutions. Space data provide a unique perspective for investigating the atmospheric environment at a regional scale. By utilizing multiple satellite retrievals from 2005 to 2013, this study presented, for the first time, the spatial patterns and temporal trends of typical air pollutants over PRD and its vicinity. As viewed from space, aerosol optical depth (AOD), NO2 and SO2 all had their higher values at the central part of PRD, and showed clear descending gradients as moving to the outskirt of this region. As to the inter-annual variation, all these pollutants had decreasing trends in PRD during the study period, which generally agreed with the relevant in situ measurements. However, the satellite retrievals differed from ground measurements when addressing NO2 and SO2 in the vicinity of PRD. This work also provides the inter-comparison among PRD and three other metropolitan clusters in China: PRD had relatively high AOD, moderate NO2 and low SO2 levels, and it was the only region achieving the effective reduction of NO2 and SO2 during last decade. Unlike the previous three pollutants, HCHO observed by satellite showed very special patterns: it had a relatively homogeneous spatial distribution over both of PRD and its vicinity, and presented an opposite increasing trend from 2005 to 2010. Moreover, PRD had the highest HCHO level among all the metropolitan clusters, hinting a considerable contribution of biogenic origins of HCHO in PRD.",

        "abstract": "As a major source of secondary organic aerosol, open crop residue burning (OCB) emits a large number of trace gases and particulates to the atmosphere. Extensive OCB is detected during harvest seasons in most regions of China. Emissions from OCB have been widely investigated in China, but few studies have focused on regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations with a long timescale. In this study, emissions from OCB in three typical regions of China, including Northeast China, Chengdu-Chongqing and Guangdong, from 2003 to 2016, were estimated using a combination of statistical data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, and regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations and driving forces were analyzed in detail. The results showed that OCB emissions of CO and PM in 2016 were 3.63\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 and 6.96\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 tons in Northeast China, 9.77\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 and 1.36\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 tons in Chengdu-Chongqing, and 1.24\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 and 1.19\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 tons in Guangdong, respectively. The OCB emissions in Northeast China maintained an overall increasing trend, which were mainly dominated by rural economic development and agricultural modernization, with great potential for reduction. In Chengdu-Chongqing, emissions increased until 2013 and then decreased, due to the impact of policies prohibiting OCB. In Guangdong, emissions showed annual fluctuations with a slightly decreasing trend influenced by metrological conditions and related policies. The analysis of the driving forces behind the regional discrepancies among these typical regions indicated that OCB emissions in China were characterized by uneven rural economic development, control policies, and natural conditions, suggesting that region-dependent control measures are needed for reducing OCB emissions. This study provided a better understanding of OCB emission characteristics in the three typical regions and revealed the diversity of OCB emission characteristics in China.",

How to interpret the mixed results they provide, however, were less studied. In this study, a cross-validation study was conducted in one of China's fast-developing and highly populated city cluster- the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. By utilizing a highly resolved speciated regional EI and a region-wide gridded volatile organic compounds (VOCs) speciation measurement campaign, we elucidated underlying factors for discrepancies between EI and RM and proposed ways for their interpretations with the aim to achieve a scientifically plausible source identification. Results showed that numbers of species, temporal and spatial resolutions used for comparison, photochemical loss of reactive species, potential missing sources in EI and tracers used in RM were important factors contributed to the discrepancies. Ensuring the consensus of species used in EIs and RMs, utilizing a larger spatial coverage and longer time span, addressing the impacts of photochemical losses, and supplementing emissions from missing sources could help reconcile the discrepancies in VOC source characterizations acquired using both approaches. By leveraging the advantages and circumventing the disadvantages in both methods, the EI and RM could play synergistic roles to obtain robust SAs to improve air quality management practices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Guangdong province (GD), one of the most prosperous and populous regions in China, still experiences haze events and growing ozone pollution, although it has seen substantial air quality improvement in recent years. Co-control of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and ozone in GD calls for a systematic review of historical emission patterns. In this study, emission trends, spatial variations, source-contribution variations, and reduction potentials of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), PM 2.5 , inhalable particles (PM 10 ), carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH 3 ), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in GD from 2006 to 2015 are revealed using a dynamic methodology, taking into account economic development, technology penetration, and emission controls. The relative change rates of anthropogenic emissions in GD during 2006\u20132015 were \u221248% for SO 2 , \u22120.5\u2009% for NO x , \u221216\u2009% for PM 2.5 , \u221222\u2009% for PM 10 , 13\u2009% for CO, 3\u2009% for NH 3 , and 13\u2009% for VOCs. The declines of SO 2 , NO x , PM 2.5 , and PM 10  emissions are mainly attributed to the control-driven emission reductions in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, especially from power plants, industrial combustion, on-road mobile sources, and fugitive dust, and partly to the shift of industries from the PRD to the non-PRD (NPRD) region in GD. NPRD also contributed to part of the emission decline, but it was only effective until 2011 when GD\u2019s Clean Air Action of 12th Five-Year was implemented. Due to the growth of solvent use and the absence of effective control measures, VOC emissions in PRD and NPRD both steadily increased, and this might be one of the reasons that led to the slight upward trends of ozone concentrations in GD. To further reduce emissions, future work should focus on power plants and industrial combustion in GD and industrial process source in NPRD for emissions of SO 2 , NO x , and particulate matter, and on solvent use and on-road mobile sources for VOC emissions. This study provides solid scientific support for further air quality improvement in GD. In addition, it provides robust data to quantify the impact of emission and meteorology variations on air quality and unveil the primary cause of significant air quality change in the PRD region in recent decade.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key precursors of photochemical smog. Quantitatively evaluating the contributions of VOCs sources to ozone (O 3 ) formation could provide valuable information for emissions control and photochemical pollution abatement. This study analysed the continuously measured VOCs during the photochemical season in 2014 at a receptor site (Heshan site, HS) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, where photochemical pollution has been a long-standing issue. The averaged mixing ratio of measure VOCs was 34\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009ppbv, with the largest contribution from alkanes (17\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009ppbv, 49\u2009%), followed by aromatics, alkenes, and acetylene. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was applied to resolve the anthropogenic sources of VOCs, coupled with a photochemical-aged-based parameterization that better considers the photochemical processing effects. Four anthropogenic emission sources were identified and quantified, with gasoline vehicular emission as the most significant contributor to the observed VOCs, followed by diesel vehicular emissions, biomass burning, and solvent usage. The O 3  photochemical formation regime at HS was identified as VOCs-limited by a photochemical box model with the master chemical mechanism (PBM-MCM). The PBM-MCM model results also suggested that vehicular emission was the most important source to the O 3  formation, followed by biomass burning and solvent usage. Sensitivity analysis indicated that in order to prevent the increment of O 3  concentration, the abatement ratios of the individual VOC source vs. NO  x   should be higher than 3.8, 4.6, 4.6, and 3.3, respectively, for diesel vehicular emission, solvent usage, biomass burning, and gasoline vehicular emission, respectively. Based on the above results, a brief review on the policies on the controlling of vehicular emissions and biomass burning in the PRD region from a regional perspective were also provided in this study. It reveals that different policies have been/being implemented and formulated could help to alleviate the photochemical pollution in the PRD. Nevertheless, evaluation on the cost-benefit of each policy is still needed to improve the air quality.",

The average mixing ratios of total carbonyl compounds in Beijing were (16.38 +/- 6.03) x 10(-9) and (8.50 +/- 5.27) x 10(-9) in summer and winter; and the average mixing ratios in surrounding cites were (13.19 +/- 5.71) x 10(-9) and (13.05 +/- 2.44) x 10(-9) in summer and winter, respectively. The most abundant carbonyl compound was formaldehyde, followed by acetaldehyde and acetone, the sum of these 3 species accounted for 78% to 91% of the total mixing ratio of carbonyl compounds. The average mixing ratio in summer was significant higher than that in winter, and higher in morning (09:00-12:00) hours than in afternoon (13:00-16:00). The spatial distributions for carbonyl compounds showed that: in summer, high mixing ratios were typically found in city center; while in winter, a building-up trend was found from northwest to southeast, driving by the prevailing northwest wind. In summer, vehicular exhaust had important contributions to ambient carbonyls, and combined with the adverse weather conditions and the strong photochemical production, resulted in carbonyls pollutions; in winter, directly emissions were the main sources of carbonyls, such as vehicular exhaust and coal burning.",

And the toxic VOCs for children's health were identified. The study illuminates that the concentration level of total VOCs were higher in indoor air than in outdoor air. Alkanes were most abundant VOCs species accounting for 32.8% of total measured VOCs on average. The chemical speciation of VOCs in indoor air was similar to the outdoor, and the dominant species were isopentane, benzene, toluene, propanal, propene and dichloromethane. In the indoor air, m/p-dichlorobenzene and cyclohexane likely came from indoor sources, proved by the indoor/outdoor concentration ratios of p-dichlorobenzene (65.8) and cyclohexane (10.5), and the large distance between the concentrations of m-dichlorobenzene in indoor air (2.02 \u00d7 10 -9) and outdoor (lower than the detected limit) air. 1, 3-butadiene, chloride vinyl, benzene and chloromethane, whose average cancer risk values were 1.3 \u00d7 10 -5, 6.4 \u00d7 10 -6, 5.1 \u00d7 10 -6 and 3.3 \u00d7 10 -6 respectively, exceeded the cancer risk value 1 \u00d7 10 -6 in all samples sites. The cumulative cancer risk in indoor air, outdoor air and children house were 24-39 times bigger than 1 \u00d7 10 -6. Acrolein was the only non-carcinogenic hazardous species which exceeded its benchmark concentration by 13-72 times in all sites.",

        "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a very important portion in mass concentration of ambient fine particles (PM2.5), and the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are one of the most important precursors for SOA formation. Considering the complexity of the processes from the VOCs conversion to SOA production, the parameterization is a practical approach in estimating SOA formation potential, and hence in identifying the relative contributions of various VOC species to fine particles. Two estimation methods were introduced in this study, namely 2-products method and the volatility basis-set method, and the estimation results from recent literatures were compared. This work also discussed the existing problems in current parameterization methods. More attentions and detailed investigations should be paid in accurate quantification of VOC-to-SOA transformation in future atmospheric chemistry studies.",

In the urban areas formaldehyde comes mainly from primary sources such as vehicular emissions and photochemical oxidation progresses. However, there are very limited researches on sources of ambient formaldehyde. Recently, source apportionment of ambient formaldehyde based on the statistical analysis by using tracers, is of increasing concern. The authors introduce the possible tracers for formaldehyde sources in cities. The results from several case studies indicate the significance of secondary sources to ambient formaldehyde. The feasibility of using various tracers for primary and secondary formaldehyde sources is discussed.",

The sampled flue gas and clean air were fully mixed in the dilution cavity, the Reynolds number in the dilution cavity was 10000 typically. The resident time was 90 second and it provided enough time for the growth and nucleation of particles. The system was applied to measure some stationary sources in China, including 9 coal-fired and oil-fired boilers. These boilers were observed to investigate the mass concentration, the emission factor of PM10 and PM2.5, OC/EC makeup during the combustion.",

        "abstract": "An intensive field campaign including measurements from the environmental monitoring network and from two super sites took\n place in the Pearl River Delta region in summer 2006. Using routinely measured O3 and NOx concentrations, the spatial and temporal variation of O3 and of the total oxidant concentrations was characterized. According to the spatial variability of NO2/NO, the two super sites were found to be representative of polluted urban and downwind suburban conditions. In addition,\n both sites were located in high O3 regions. In-depth diagnostic of photochemical ozone production processes and their key controlling factors are achieved with\n an observation-based model (OBM) to gain regional perspectives. Budget analysis and sensitivity model runs show that aldehyde\n and HONO chemistry had significant impacts on local photochemical ozone production rates. The analysis of calculated Relative\n Incremental Reactivities shows that photochemical ozone production rates are mainly sensitive to anthropogenic hydrocarbons\n (HCs) in the polluted urban areas. In the suburban areas, sensitivity to nitrogen oxide (NO) concentrations dominated. Key\n anthropogenic HCs in both areas are alkenes and aromatics. Significant differences of ozone production efficiencies are identified\n between the urban and suburban regions, consistent with the OBM diagnosed results.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that DNA oxidative damage be related to the chemical constituents of ambient particles. The purpose of this study was to examine whether particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and quinone-structure chemicals increase body burden of oxidative stress in human exposed to heavy traffic volume. We recruited two nonsmoking security guards who worked at a university campus gate near a heavily trafficked road. Each subject wore a personal air sampler for 24h per day to estimate exposures to 24 PAHs and anthraquinone (AnQ) in PM(2.5). Daily pre- and post-work shift spot urines were collected for 29d from each subject. Urine samples were analyzed for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Additionally, using 19 organic tracers other than 24 PAHs and AnQ, a receptor source apportionment model of chemical mass balance was applied to determine the contributions of sources on the PM: gasoline vehicle, diesel vehicle, coal burning, vegetable debris, cooking, natural gas and biomass burning. The relationship among urinary 8-OHdG, individual PAH, and AnQ was demonstrated as follows: the average urinary concentration of 8-OHdG was increased more than three times after 8-h work-shift than those before the work shift. All the 24 PAH and AnQ levels were positively and significantly associated with the post-work urinary 8-OHdG. The results from source apportionment suggest vehicular emission to be the dominant source of personal exposure to PM(2.5). Our finding indicates that personal air exposures to 24 individual PAHs and AnQ originating from traffic emissions are important in increasing oxidative burdens in human body.",

        "title": "Observation and modelling of OH and HO2 concentrations in the Pearl River Delta 2006: A missing OH source in a VOC rich atmosphere",
        "abstract": "Ambient OH and HO2 concentrations were measured by laser induced fluorescence (LIF) during the PRIDE-PRD2006 (Program of Regional Integrated Experiments of Air Quality over the Pearl River Delta, 2006) campaign at a rural site downwind of the megacity of Guangzhou in Southern China. The observed OH concentrations reached daily peak values of (15-26) \u00d7 106 cm-3 which are among the highest values so far reported for urban and suburban areas. The observed OH shows a consistent high correlation with j(O1D) over a broad range of NOx conditions. The correlation cannot be reproduced by model simulations, indicating that OH stabilizing processes are missing in current models. The observed OH exhibited a weak dependence on NOx in contrast to model predictions. While modelled and measured OH agree well at NO mixing ratios above 1 ppb, a continuously increasing underprediction of the observed OH is found towards lower NO concentrations, reaching a factor of 8 at 0.02 ppb NO. A dependence of the modelled-to-measured OH ratio on isoprene cannot be concluded from the PRD data. However, the magnitude of the ratio fits into the isoprene dependent trend that was reported from other campaigns in forested regions. Hofzumahaus et al. (2009) proposed an unknown OH recycling process without NO, in order to explain the high OH levels at PRD in the presence of high VOC reactivity and low NO. Taking a recently discovered interference in the LIF measurement of HO2 into account, the need for an additional HO2 \u2192 OH recycling process persists, but the required source strength may be up to 20% larger than previously determined. Recently postulated isoprene mechanisms by Lelieveld et al. (2008) and Peeters and M\u00fcller (2010) lead to significant enhancements of OH expected for PRD, but an underprediction of the observed OH by a factor of two remains at low NO (0.1-0.2 ppb). If the photolysis of hydroperoxy aldehydes from isoprene is as efficient as proposed by Peeters and M\u00fcller (2010), the corresponding OH formation at PRD would be more important than the primary OH production from ozone and HONO. While the new isoprene mechanisms need to be confirmed by laboratory experiments, there is probably need for other, so far unidentified chemical processes to explain entirely the high OH levels observed in Southern China. \u00a9 2012 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured online at an urban site in Beijing in August-September 2010. Diurnal variations of various VOC species indicate that VOCs concentrations were influenced by photochemical removal with OH radicals for reactive species and secondary formation for oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs). A photochemical age-based parameterization method was applied to characterize VOCs chemistry. A large part of the variability in concentrations of both hydrocarbons and OVOCs was explained by this method. The determined emission ratios of hydrocarbons to acetylene agreed within a factor of two between 2005 and 2010 measurements. However, large differences were found for emission ratios of some alkanes and C8 aromatics between Beijing and northeastern United States secondary formation from anthropogenic VOCs generally contributed higher percentages to concentrations of reactive aldehydes than those of inert ketones and alcohols. Anthropogenic primary emissions accounted for the majority of ketones and alcohols concentrations. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was also used to identify emission sources from this VOCs data set. The four resolved factors were three anthropogenic factors and a biogenic factor. However, the anthropogenic factors are attributed here to a common source at different stages of photochemical processing rather than three independent sources. Anthropogenic and biogenic sources of VOCs concentrations were not separated completely in PMF. This study indicates that photochemistry of VOCs in the atmosphere complicates the information about separated sources that can be extracted from PMF and the influence of photochemical processing must be carefully considered in the interpretation of source apportionment studies based upon PMF. \u00a9 2012.

        "title": "Missing OH source in a suburban environment near Beijing: Observed and modelled OH and HO2 concentrations in summer 2006",
        "abstract": "Measurements of ambient OH and HO2 radicals were performed by laser induced fluorescence (LIF) during CAREBeijing2006 (Campaigns of Air Quality Research in Beijing and Surrounding Region 2006) at the suburban site Yufa in the south of Beijing in summer 2006. On most days, local air chemistry was influenced by aged air pollution that was advected by a slow, almost stagnant wind from southern regions. Observed daily concentration maxima were in the range of (4-17) \u00d7 106 cm-3 for OH and (2-24) \u00d7 108 cm-3 for HO2 (including an estimated interference of 25% from RO2). During daytime, OH reactivities were generally high (10-30 s-1) and mainly contributed by observed VOCs and their calculated oxidation products. The comparison of modelled and measured HOx concentrations reveals a systematic underprediction of OH as a function of NO. A large discrepancy of a factor 2.6 is found at the lowest NO concentration encountered (0.1 ppb), whereas the discrepancy becomes insignificant above 1 ppb NO. This study extends similar observations from the Pearl-River Delta (PRD) in South China to a more urban environment. The OH discrepancy at Yufa can be resolved, if NO-independent additional OH recycling is assumed in the model. The postulated Leuven Isoprene Mechanism (LIM) has the potential to explain the gap between modelled and measured OH at Beijing taking into account conservative error estimates, but lacks experimental confirmation. This and the hereby unresolved discrepancy at PRD suggest that other VOCs besides isoprene might be involved in the required, additional OH recycling. Fast primary production of ROx radicals up to 7 ppb h-1 was determined at Beijing which was dominated by the photolysis of O3, HONO, HCHO, and dicarbonyls. For a special case, 20 August, when the plume of Beijing city was encountered, a missing primary HOx source (about 3 ppb h-1) was determined under high NOx conditions similar to other urban areas like Mexico City. CAREBeijing2006 emphasizes the important role of OVOCs as a radical source and sink, and the need for further investigation of the chemical degradation of VOCs in order to better understand radical chemistry in VOC-rich air. \u00a9 2013 Author(s).",

        "title": "VOC emissions, evolutions and contributions to SOA formation at a receptor site in eastern China",
        "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured by two online instruments (GC-FID/MS and PTR-MS) at a receptor site on Changdao Island (37.99 N, 120.70 E) in eastern China. Reaction with OH radical dominated chemical losses of most VOC species during the Changdao campaign. A photochemical-age-based parameterization method is used to calculate VOC emission ratios and to quantify the evolution of ambient VOCs. The calculated emission ratios of most hydrocarbons agree well with those obtained from emission inventory data, but determined emission ratios of oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) are significantly higher than those from emission inventory data. The photochemical-age-based parameterization method is also used to investigate primary emissions and secondary formation of organic aerosol. The primary emission ratio of organic aerosol (OA) to CO is determined to be 14.9 \u03bcg m-3 ppm-1, and secondary organic aeorosols (SOA) are produced at an enhancement ratio of 18.8 \u03bcg m-3 ppm-1 to CO after 50 h of photochemical processing in the atmosphere. SOA formation is significantly higher than the level determined from VOC oxidation under both high-NOx (2.0 \u03bcg m-3 ppm-1 CO) and low-NOx conditions (6.5 \u03bcg m-3 ppm-1 CO). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and higher alkanes (> C10) account for as high as 17.4% of SOA formation, which suggests semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) may be a large contributor to SOA formation during the Changdao campaign. The SOA formation potential of primary VOC emissions determined from field campaigns in Beijing and Pearl River Delta (PRD) is lower than the measured SOA levels reported in the two regions, indicating SOA formation is also beyond explainable by VOC oxidation in the two city clusters. \u00a9 2013 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Ambient alkyl nitrates (RONO2) are important byproducts of O3 formation. Although concern about O3 pollution has increased recently, few studies have investigated RONO2 chemistry and distributions in China. In this study, ambient levels of C1-C4 RONO2 were measured in Chinese cities, and their relationships with parent hydrocarbons (RH), carbonyls, and total oxidant (Ox=O3+NO2) were investigated. Our measurements showed that 2-butyl nitrate (2-BuONO2) was the most abundant RONO2 species, with mixing ratios of 48-88pptv, followed by 2-propyl nitrate (2-PrONO2), ethyl nitrate (EtONO2), methyl nitrate (MeONO2), and 1-propyl nitrate (1-PrONO2). The measured RONO2 species exhibited maximum levels in the early afternoon (13:00-14:00) of summer, suggesting the importance of RONO2 photochemical production. Relative to 2-BuONO2/n-butane, the measured 1-PrONO2/propane agreed well with the modeled ratio based on laboratory kinetic data, suggesting that propane was the dominant precursor of ambient 1-PrONO2. However, the measured ratios for MeONO2/methane, EtONO2/ethane, and summertime 2-PrONO2/propane showed significant positive deviations from the predicted values, indicating the existence of additional sources other than OH oxidation of the parent hydrocarbons. Initial mixing ratios of C1-C3 carbonyls during 08:00-12:00 in summer at the PKU site exhibited significant correlations with RONO2 levels, suggesting the importance of secondary sources for ambient carbonyls. The measured ratios of formaldehyde/MeONO2 were close to the theoretical ratio, whereas the derived ratios for acetaldehyde/EtONO2, propanal/1-PrONO2, and acetone/2-PrONO2 were higher than the kinetic ratios, indicating that these carbonyls might be produced from sources other than the reaction of alkoxy radicals with O2. Carbonyls are important precursors of Ox, but their photochemical reactions do not result in RONO2 production. Therefore, Ox/RONO2 could indicate the relative importance of carbonyls to Ox formation. On the basis of the measured ratios of Ox/2-BuONO2, we estimated the maximum contributions of secondary carbonyls to Ox at the PKU site to be 25-32% during 12:00-16:00 in summer. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Experiments were performed to measure the emission factors (EFs) of gaseous carbonaceous species, such as CO2, CO, CH4, and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), from the combustion of five types of coal of varying organic maturity and two types of biomass briquettes under residential burning conditions. Samples were collected in stainless steel canisters and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) cartridges and were analyzed by GC-FID/MS and HPLC, respectively. The EFs from crop residue briquette burning were generally higher than those from coals, with the exception of CO2. The dominant NMVOC species identified in coal smoke were carbonyls (41. 7%), followed by C2 unsaturated hydrocarbons (29. 1%) and aromatics (12. 1%), while C2 unsaturated hydrocarbons were the dominant species (68. 9%) emitted from the combustion of crop residue briquettes, followed by aromatics (14. 4%). A comparison of burning normal crop residues in stoves and the open field indicated that briquettes emitted a larger proportion of ethene and acetylene. Both combustion efficiency and coal organic maturity had a significant impact on NMVOC EFs from burning coal: NMVOC emissions increased with increasing coal organic maturity but decreased as the combustion efficiency improved. Emissions from the combustion of crop residue briquettes from stoves occurred mainly during the smoldering process, with low combustion efficiency. Therefore, an improved stove design to allow higher combustion efficiency would be beneficial for reducing emissions of carbonaceous air pollutants. \u00a9 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

The air from the exhaust was sampled by 2,4-dinitrophenyhydrazine cartridge and 23 carbonyl compounds were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The average emission factor of carbonyls was 97.2 mg/km, higher than that of light-duty diesel vehicles and gasoline-powered vehicles. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone and propionaldehyde were the species with the highest emission factors. Main influencing factors for carbonyl emissions were vehicle type, average speed and regulated emission standard, and the impact of vehicle loading was not evident in this study. National emission of carbonyls from diesel vehicles exhaust was calculated for China, 2011, based on both vehicle miles traveled and fuel consumption. Carbonyl emission of diesel vehicle was estimated to be 45.8 Gg, and was comparable to gasoline-powered vehicles (58.4 Gg). The emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone were 12.6, 6.9, 3.8 Gg, respectively. The ozone formation potential of carbonyls from diesel vehicles exhaust was 537 mg O3/km, higher than 497 mg O3/km of none-methane hydrocarbons emitted from diesel vehicles.",

The results showed that 1) MTBE could be prevalently checked in atmosphere of traffic area, industrial area, residential area and commercial area of the PRD, and its range of hourly average concentration in the long-term observation was from 0 - 1.250 microg m(-3), the summer had more serious pollution than the spring, and urban was the central area of high MTBE concentration, and suburban in the downwind was obviously polluted by the urban air. 2) During the enhanced observation in summertime, the diurnal average concentration of Guangzhou urban site was (1.520 +/- 0.370) microg m(-3), which was about 7 times of Huadou site in the downwind of Guangzhou and over 100 times of Conghua site in the background of Guangzhou. In urban, 2 peak values appeared in the period of 10:00 - 12:00 and 16:00 - 18:00 respectively, and the nighttime had the lowest average concentration, but the suburban in the downwind had the peak value in the nighttime. 3) During the enhanced observation in wintertime, the diurnal average concentration of Guangzhou urban site was (0.950 +/- 0.240) microg m(-3), which was 3.6 times of Xinken site in the downwind of Guangzhou. Several peak values appeared on the diurnal variation, the high concentration period of urban was in 18:00 - 22:00, and that of suburban was in 04:00 - 10:00 of the next day. 4) When it was weak sunshine, the concentration of MTBE beside the urban traffic roadside was decreasing with the height increasing, but when it was strong sunshine, it was increasing with the height increasing. So, except the original emission from the automobiles, MTBE still had the secondary pollution sources formed by air photochemical reaction.",

However,the roles of carbonyls in air chemistry are not well understood due to the measurement difficulties.This work improved the method of PF PH derivatization-thermal desorption followed by GC/MS analy-sis by using SIM (selected ion monitoring) mode. 23 carbonyls in the atmosphere were measured and QA/QC procedure of this method was established. Relative errors of these carbonyls were checked by using TO-15 standard gas from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The method detection limits ranged between 0.01 and 0.25nmol,the relative errors of ambient carbonyls concentrations were -7.8%\u2014-40.2%.

The vertical distributions of NO2, HCHO, and CHOCHO were independently retrieved by an automated iteration method. The NO2 mixing ratios measured by MAX-DOAS showed reasonable agreement with the simultaneous, ground based in-situ data. The tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) observed by OMI on board EOS-Aura satellite were higher than with those by MAX-DOAS. The 3-D chemical transport model CMAQ overestimated the NO2 VCDs as well as the surface concentrations by about 65%. From this observation, a reduction of NOx emission strength in CMAQ seems to be necessary in order to well reproduce the NO2 observations. The average mixing ratios of HCHO and CHOCHO were 7 ppb and 0.4 ppb, respectively, higher than in other rural or semirural environments. The high ratio of 0.062 between CHOCHO and HCHO corresponds to the high VOCs reactivity and high HOx turnover rate consistent with other observations during the campaign. \u00a9 2013 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "We analyze summertime photochemistry near the surface in Beijing, China, using a 1-D photochemical model (Regional chEmical and trAnsport Model, REAM-1D) constrained by in situ observations, focusing on the budgets of RO x (OH + HO 2 + RO 2) radicals and O3 formation. While the modeling analysis focuses on near-surface photochemical budgets, the implications for the budget of O 3 in the planetary boundary layer are also discussed. In terms of daytime average, the total RO x primary production rate near the surface in Beijing is 6.6 ppbv per hour (ppbv h -1, among the highest found in urban atmospheres. The largest primary RO x source in Beijing is photolysis of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), which produces HO 2 and RO 2 at 2.5 ppbv h -1 and 1.7 ppbv h -1, respectively. Photolysis of excess HONO from an unknown heterogeneous source is the predominant primary OH source at 2.2 ppbv h -1, much larger than that of O1D+H2O (0.4 ppbv h -1). The largest RO x sink is via OH + NO 2 reaction (1.6 ppbv h -1), followed by formation of RO 2NO 2 (1.0 ppbv h -1) and RONO 2 (0.7 ppbv h -1). Due to the large aerosol surface area, aerosol uptake of HO 2 appears to be another important radical sink, although the estimate of its magnitude is highly variable depending on the uptake coefficient value used. The daytime average O 3 production and loss rates near the surface are 32 ppbv h -1 and 6.2 ppbv h -1, respectively. Assuming NO 2 to be the source of excess HONO, the NO 2 to HONO transformation leads to considerable O 3 loss and reduction of its lifetime. Our observation-constrained modeling analysis suggests that oxidation of VOCs (especially aromatics) and heterogeneous reactions (e.g. HONO formation and aerosol uptake HO 2) play potentially critical roles in the primary radical budget and O 3 formation in Beijing. One important ramification is that O 3 production is neither NOx nor VOC limited, but in a transition regime where reduction of either NOx or VOCs could result in reduction of O 3 production. The transition regime implies more flexibility in the O 3 control strategies than a binary system of either NO x or VOC limited regime. The co-benefit of concurrent reduction of both NO x and VOCs in reducing column O 3 production integrated in the planetary boundary layer is significant. Further research on the spatial extent of the transition regime over the polluted eastern China is critically important for controlling regional O 3 pollution. \u00a9 2012 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Ambient air measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) were conducted and characterised during a two-year grid study in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of southern China. The present grid study pioneered the systematic investigation of the nature and characteristics of complex VOC and OVOC sources at a regional scale. The largest contributing VOCs, accounting over 80% of the total VOCs mixing ratio, were toluene, ethane, ethyne, propane, ethene, butane, benzene, pentane, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. Sub-regional VOC spatial characteristics were identified, namely: i) relatively fresh pollutants, consistent with elevated vehicular and industrial activities, around the PRD estuary; and ii) a concentration gradient with higher mixing ratios of VOCs in the west as compared with the eastern part of PRD. Based on alkyl nitrate aging determination, a high hydroxyl radical (OH) concentration favoured fast hydrocarbon reactions and formation of locally produced ozone. The photochemical reactivity analysis showed aromatic hydrocarbons and alkenes together consisted of around 80% of the ozone formation potential (OFP) among the key VOCs. We also found that the OFP from OVOCs should not be neglected since their OFP contribution was more than one-third of that from VOCs alone. These findings support the choice of current air pollution control policy which focuses on vehicular sources but warrants further controls. Industrial emissions and VOCs emitted by solvents should be the next targets for ground-level ozone abatement. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

In most cities, the ambient mixing ratios of CFCs were within 20% enhancements of the background values, while the levels of HCFCs and HFCs were significantly higher than the background values (P<. 0.01). Compared with the results of previous research conducted in 2001 and other single-city studies, the levels of CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-113 have decreased since then, while the levels of HCFCs and HFCs have increased rapidly.

        "abstract": "Recent comparisons between satellite observed and global model simulated glyoxal (CHOCHO) have consistently revealed a large unknown source of CHOCHO over China. We examine this missing CHOCHO source by analyzing SCIAMACHY observed CHOCHO vertical column densities (VCDs) using a Regional chEmical trAnsport Model (REAM). This missing source is first quantified by the difference between SCIAMACHY observed and REAM simulated CHOCHO VCDs (C CHOCHO), which have little overlap with high biogenic isoprene emissions but are collocated with dense population and high anthropogenic NO x and VOC emissions. We then apply inverse modeling to constrain CHOCHO precursor emissions based on SCIAMACHY CHOCHO and find that this missing source is most likely caused by substantially underestimated aromatics emissions (by a factor of 4-10, varying spatially) in the VOC emission inventories over China used in current regional and global models. Comparison with in situ observations in Beijing, Shanghai, and a site in the Pearl River Delta shows that the large model biases in aromatics concentrations are greatly reduced after the inversion. The top-down estimated aromatics emission is 13.4 Tg yr -1 in total, about 6 times the bottom-up estimate (2.4 Tg yr -1). The resulting impact on regional oxidant levels is large (e.g., \u223c100% increase of PAN in the afternoon). Furthermore, since aromatics are important precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), such an increase of aromatics could lead to \u223c50% increase of global aromatic SOA production and thereby help to reduce the low bias of simulated organic aerosols over the region in previous modeling studies. \u00a9 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.",

        "abstract": "We performed measurements of nitrous acid (HONO) during the PRIDE-PRD2006 campaign in the Pearl River Delta region 60 km north of Guangzhou, China, for 4 weeks in June 2006. HONO was measured by a LOPAP in-situ instrument which was setup in one of the campaign supersites along with a variety of instruments measuring hydroxyl radicals, trace gases, aerosols, and meteorological parameters. Maximum diurnal HONO mixing ratios of 1-5 ppb were observed during the nights. We found that the nighttime build-up of HONO can be attributed to the heterogeneous NO2 to HONO conversion on ground surfaces and the OH + NO reaction. In addition to elevated nighttime mixing ratios, measured noontime values of \u2248200 ppt indicate the existence of a daytime source higher than the OH + NO\u2192HONO reaction. Using the simultaneously recorded OH, NO, and HONO photolysis frequency, a daytime additional source strength of HONO (Pm) was calculated to be 0.77 ppb h-1 on average. This value compares well to previous measurements in other environments. Our analysis of Pm provides evidence that the photolysis of HNO3 adsorbed on ground surfaces contributes to the HONO formation. \u00a9 2012 Author(s).",

CO emission is estimated through integration of observations data obtained from 25 sites in Beijing and surrounding areas of which 13 sites selected as assimilation sites are used to perform a joint adjustment of both CO concentrations and emissions with hourly surface CO observations, and 12 other sites selected to validate the inversion emission inventory. As a result, estimated CO emissions (Tgyear-1) for Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan and Baoding are 4.11, 3.75, 3.17 and 4.08, respectively; higher than the a priori estimates in the Regional Emission inventory in Asia Version 1.1 (REAS V1.1) by 50%, 80%, 120% and 150% respectively. Obviously, the regional CO emissions are underestimated in REAS1.1, especially over Beijing and surrounding areas. Use of the inverse emission inventory reduces the bias of CO simulation by 64% at assimilation sites and 48% at validation sites. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

In this study, gridded field observations by passive air sampling at 90 sites were undertaken to determine the levels, spatial distributions, and sources of PCNs in the atmosphere of North China. A median concentration of 48 pg m(-3) (range: 10-2460 pg m(-3)) for \u221129PCNs indicated heavy PCN pollution. The compositional profile indicated that nearly 90% of PCNs observed were from thermal processes rather than from commercial mixtures. Regarding the source type, a quantitative apportionment suggested that local non-point emissions contributed two-thirds of the total PCNs observed in the study, whereas a point source of electronic-waste recycling site contributed a quarter of total PCNs. The estimated toxic equivalent quantity for dioxin-like PCNs ranged from 0.97 to 687 fg TEQ m(-3), with the electronic-waste recycling site with the highest risk.",

        "title": "Size-resolved measurement of the mixing state of soot in the megacity Beijing, China: Diurnal cycle, aging and parameterization",
        "abstract": "Soot particles are the most efficient light absorbing aerosol species in the atmosphere, playing an important role as a driver of global warming. Their climate effects strongly depend on their mixing state, which significantly changes their light absorbing capability and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity. Therefore, knowledge about the mixing state of soot and its aging mechanism becomes an important topic in the atmospheric sciences. The size-resolved (30-320 nm diameter) mixing state of soot particles in polluted megacity air was measured at a suburban site (Yufa) during the CAREBeijing 2006 campaign in Beijing, using a volatility tandem differential mobility analyzer (VTDMA). Particles in this size range with non-volatile residuals at 300 \u00b0C were considered to be soot particles. On average, the number fraction of internally mixed soot in total soot particles (F in), decreased from 0.80 to 0.57 when initial D p increased from 30 to 320 nm. Further analysis reveals that: (1) F in was well correlated with the aerosol hygroscopic mixing state measured by a CCN counter. More externally mixed soot particles were observed when particles showed more heterogeneous features with regard to hygroscopicity. (2) F in had pronounced diurnal cycles. For particles in the accumulation mode (D p at 100-320 nm), largest F in were observed at noon time, with apparent turnover rates (k ex\u2192 in) up to 7.8% hg -1. (3)F in was subject to competing effects of both aging and emissions. While aging increases F in by converting externally mixed soot particles into internally mixed ones, emissions tend to reduce F in by emitting more fresh and externally mixed soot particles. Similar competing effects were also found with air mass age indicators. (4) Under the estimated emission intensities, actual turnover rates of soot (k ex\u2192 in) up to 20% hg -1 were derived, which showed a pronounced diurnal cycle peaking around noon time. This result confirms that (soot) particles are undergoing fast aging/coating with the existing high levels of condensable vapors in the megacity Beijing. (5) Diurnal cycles of F in were different between Aitken and accumulation mode particles, which could be explained by the faster growth of smaller Aitken mode particles into larger size bins. To improve the F in prediction in regional/global models, we suggest parameterizing F in by an air mass aging indicator, i.e., F in Combining double low line, where and are empirical coefficients determined from observations, and x is the value of an air mass age indicator. At the Yufa site in the North China Plain, fitted coefficients (a) were determined as (0.57, 0.21), (0.47, 0.21), and (0.52, 0.0088) for x i (indicators) as [NOz]/[NOy], [E]/[X] ([ethylbenzene]/[m,p-xylene]) and ([IM] + [OM])/[EC] ([inorganic + organic matter]/[elemental carbon]), respectively. Such a parameterization consumes little additional computing time, but yields a more realistic description of F in compared with the simple treatment of soot mixing state in regional/global models. \u00a9 2012 Author(s).",

The PM2.5 levels in Beijing were very high, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2001 was 7 times of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards proposed by US EPA. The major chemical compositions were organics, sulfate, crustals and nitrate. It was found that the mass concentrations of PM2.5 were influenced by meteorological conditions. The correlation between the mass concentrations of PM2.5 and the relative humidity was found. And the correlation became closer at higher relative humidity. And the mass concentrations of PM2.5 were negtive-correlated to wind speeds, but the correlation between the mass concentration of PM2.5 and wind speed was not good at stronger wind.",

        "abstract": "The pollution of PM2.5 is a serious environmental problem in Beijing. The annual average concentration of PM2.5 in 2001 from seasonal monitor results was more than six times that of the US national ambient air quality standards proposed by US EPA. The major contributors to mass of PM2.5 were organics, crustal elements and sulfate. The chemical composition of PM2.5 varied largely with season, but was similar at different monitor stations in the same season. The fine particles (PM2.5) cause atmospheric visibility deterioration through light extinction. The mass concentrations of PM2.5 were anti-correlated to the visibility, the best fits between atmospheric visibility and the mass concentrations of PM2.5 varied throughout the year: following a power law in spring, exponential in summer, logarithmic in autumn, and power or exponential in winter. As in each season the meteorological parameters such as air temperature and relative humidity change from day to day, the reason for the above correlations between PM2.5 and visibility obtained at different seasons probably come from the differences in chemical compositions of PM2.5.",

The results show that fugitive PM10 emission from construction activities was up to 416 tons, accounting for 4% of all PM10 source emissions in the urban area of Guiyang. Construction fugitive dust showed great impact on the ambient PM10 level in Guiyang, and contributed 12% to the annual mean concentration of PM10 over the urban area.

        "abstract": "Using a GC/FID/MS system, we analyzed the mixing ratio of 16 halocarbon species in more than 100 air samples collected in 2004 from the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of southern China. The results revealed that there are elevated mixing ratios for most of halocarbons, especially for HClC Combining double low line CCl2 (trichloroethylene, TCE), CH2Cl 2 (dichloromethane, DCM), CH3 Br (bromomethane), HCFC-22, CHCl3 (trichloromethane), CCl4 (tetrachloromethane), Cl2C Combining double low line CCl2 (perchloroethylene, PCE), CH3CCl3 (methyl chloroform, MCF), and CFC-12. Comparisons were done with the data from TRACE-P and ALE/GAGE/AGAGE experiments, we found that the large variability in mixing ratios (relative standard deviation ranged from 9.31 % to 96.55 %) of the halocarbons suggested substantial local emissions from the PRD region in 2004. Correlations between the mixing ratio of each species and carbon monoxide (CO) was examined, and then the emission of each halocarbon was quantified based on scaling the optimized CO emission inventory with the slope of the regression line fitted to each species relative to CO. The calculated results revealed that mass of CH2Cl 2 (7.0 Gg), CH3CCl3 (6.7 Gg), and Cl2C Combining double low line CCl2 (2.3 Gg) accounted for about 62.9 % of total halocarbon emissions, it suggested a significant contribution from solvent use in the PRD region. Emissions of HCFC-22 (3.5 Gg), an alternative refrigerant to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), were about 2.3 times greater than those of CFC-12 (1.6 Gg). CFC-12 and HCFC-22 accounted for 21.5 % of total emissions of halocarbons, so that the refrigerant would be the second largest source of halocarbons. However, the ratio approach found only minor emissions of CFCs, such as CFC-11, and the emission of CFC-114 and CFC-113 were close to zero. Emissions of other anthropogenic halocarbons, such as CCl4, CHCl3, CH3Br, and CH3Cl, were also estimated. Where possible, the emissions estimated from the measured ratios were compared with results from source inventory techniques, we found that both approaches gave emissions at similar magnitude for most of the halocarbons, except CFC-11. The comparison suggested that the ratio method may be a useful tool for assessing regional halocarbon emissions, and emission uncertainty could be further reduced by incorporating both longer-term and higher-frequency observations, as well as improving the accuracy of the CO inventory. \u00a9 2011 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Previous studies suggested that certain constituents of ambient PM2.5 can induce or increase oxidative stress in biological systems. The present study is designed to examine whether exposure to traffic generated particles increases the burden of oxidative stress in humans and to identify specific PM2.5 constituents responsible for pollution-induced oxidative stress. We recruited two nonsmoking security guards who worked at a university campus gate by a heavily trafficked road. Pre- and post-workshift spot urines were collected on each of the 29 days of measurement. Concentrations of PM2.5 mass and 126 chemical species were measured at the worksite and a campus background site simultaneously. Urine samples were analyzed for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Factor analysis and linear mixed-effects regression models were used in statistical analyses. Three clusters of PM2.5 species were identified, including PAHs, metals, and polar organic compounds. Urinary concentrations of 8-OHdG increased by > 3 times following an eight-hour workshift in participants. Pre-workshift urinary concentrations of 8-OHdG were associated with PM2.5 concentrations at the background site. Post-workshift 8-OHdG concentrations were significantly and positively associated with PM2.5 mass, PAHs, and metals, but not polar organic species, measured at the worksite. Our findings provide direct evidence in humans that PM compositions are important in increasing oxidative stress burdens. Our results support that PAHs and metals are biologically active constituents of PM2.5 with regards to the induction of oxidative DNA damages in the human body.",

This large-scale manmade experiment provided an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to reduce the reactivity of hydrocarbons (HCs) from emission sources, which is important for ground-level ozone abatement. Photochemical initial concentrations (PICs), i.e., the levels of HCs from sources before undergoing chemical reactions, were calculated from ambient measurements. PICs obtained using the ratio method for HCs and the sequential reaction model for alkyl nitrates were in good agreement. Propene, 1-butene, iso-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-pentene, and m,p-xylene were identified as key reactive species in terms of their photochemical consumptions and correspondent ozone formation potentials (OFPs). During the Olympics and Paralympics, the PICs of these seven species were reduced by 27-66%, contributing 20% to the reduction in total PICs and 60% to the reduction in total OFP compared with June levels. Source apportionments from the chemical mass balance model indicated that gasoline vehicle exhaust was the predominant contributor to the key reactive species (45-78%). Reductions of gasoline vehicle exhaust during the Olympics and Paralympics explained 53-77% and 59-68% of the reductions in PICs of the key reactive HCs and total OFP, respectively.",

The experimental result shows that black carbon and elemental carbon have a good agreement with a high correlation coefficient (R2=0.80), so does organic carbon and elemental carbon (R2=0.82). The ratio of OC to EC is higher in the daytime than at night and higher at normal day than at temperature inversion day. In addition, there is no significant difference of OC to EC ratio between day and night at temperature inversion day. The average ratio of OC to EC is 4.76. It is also proved that ratio of OC to EC larger than 2 is not the exact index for secondary pollution.",

        "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosol particles serving as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are key elements of the hydrological cycle and climate. CCN properties were measured and characterized during the CAREBeijing-2006 campaign at a regional site south of the megacity of Beijing, China. Size-resolved CCN efficiency spectra recorded for a supersaturation range of S Combining double low line0.07% to 0.86% yielded average activation diameters in the range of 190 nm to 45 nm. The corresponding effective hygroscopicity parameters (\u03ba) exhibited a strong size dependence ranging from \u223c0.25 in the Aitken size range to \u223c0.45 in the accumulation size range. The campaign average value (\u03ba = 0.3 \u00b1 0.1) was similar to the values observed and modeled for other populated continental regions. The hygroscopicity parameters derived from the CCN measurements were consistent with chemical composition data recorded by an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and thermo-optical measurements of apparent elemental and organic carbon (EC and OC). The CCN hygroscopicity and its size dependence could be parameterized as a function of only AMS based organic and inorganic mass fractions (forg, finorg) using the simple mixing rule \u03bap \u2248 0.1 \u2022 forg + 0.7 \u2022 inorg. When the measured air masses originated from the north and passed rapidly over the center of Beijing (fresh city pollution), the average particle hygroscopicity was reduced (\u03ba = 0.2 \u00b1 0.1), which is consistent with enhanced mass fractions of organic compounds (\u223c50%) and EC (\u223c30%) in the fine particulate matter (PM1). Moreover, substantial fractions of externally mixed weakly CCN-active particles were observed at low supersaturation (S = 0.07%), which can be explained by the presence of freshly emitted soot particles with very low hygroscopicity (\u03ba < 0.1). Particles in stagnant air from the industrialized region south of Beijing (aged regional pollution) were on average larger and more hygroscopic, which is consistent with enhanced mass fractions (\u223c60%) of soluble inorganic ions (mostly sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate). Accordingly, the number concentration of CCN in aged air from the megacity region was higher than in fresh city outflow ((2.5-9.9) \u00d7 103 cm-3 vs. (0.4-8.3) \u00d7 103 cm-3for S = 0.07-0.86%) although the total aerosol particle number concentration was lower (1.2 \u00d7 104 cm -3 vs. 2.3 104 -3). A comparison with related studies suggests that the fresh outflow from Chinese urban centers generally may contain more, but smaller and less hygroscopic aerosol particles and thus fewer CCN than the aged outflow from megacity regions. \u00a9 2011 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "We applied a daily assimilated inversion method to estimate NO x (NO + NO 2) emissions for June-September 2007 and 2008 on the basis of the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and model simulations using the Regional chEmistry and trAnsport Model (REAM). This method allows for estimating emission changes with a finer temporal resolution than previous studies and shows that the progression of the emission reduction corresponds roughly to the scheduled implementation of emission controls over Beijing. OMI column NO 2 reductions are approximately 45%, 33%, and 14% over urban Beijing, rural Beijing, and the Huabei Plain, respectively, while the corresponding anthropogenic NO x emission reductions are only 28%, 24%, and 6%, during the full emission control period (July 20-Sep 20, 2008). Meteorological changes from summer 2007 to 2008 are the main factor contributing to the column NO 2 decreases not accounted for by the emission reduction. The surface ozone changes due to NO x emission reduction are negligible using a standard VOC emission inventory. When using enhanced VOC (particularly aromatics) emissions derived from in situ observations, urban Beijing shifted O 3 production from the VOC-limited regime toward the NO x-limited regime resulting in a more substantial ozone decrease (up to 10 ppbv). \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

To evaluate the effectiveness of air quality control measures in Beijing in 2008, NMVOC emission inventories were compiled for June, July, August, and September with emission factors and updated activity data. Total NMVOC emissions were 22.6, 20.2, 14.9, and 14.6 Gg in June, July, August, and September, respectively. Anthropogenic NMVOC emissions were 45% lower in August than June; vehicles, solvent utilization, industrial processing, and miscellaneous sources declined by 66, 48, 15, and 75%, respectively. Anthropogenic NMVOC emissions increased in September compared with August. NMVOC emissions from petroleum storage and transport varied little during these months because of the installation of low-fugitive facilities. Reduced emissions from vehicles, industrial processing, and petroleum storage and transport contributed to the total anthropogenic reduction. Inventory uncertainties were evaluated to be [-51%, +126%], [-56%, +146%], [-58%, +161%], and [-52%, +133%] in June, July, August, and September, respectively, at the 95% confidence level. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Spatial distributions of NOx, SO2 and O3 were obtained by Kriging interpolation method. The results were compared with emission inventories and modeling results. The transportations of O3 were evaluated by using backward trajectories of air parcels. During the sampling period, the mean concentrations of NOx, SO2 and O3 were 75.9 \u03bcg/m3, 37.3 \u03bcg/m3 and 36.2 \u03bcg/m3, respectively. And the highest concentrations of NOx, SO2 and O3 were 195.7 \u03bcg/m3, 95.9 \u03bcg/m3 and 81.8 \u03bcg/m3. Comparing with routine measurements from the regional monitoring network in PRD, the results by passive method were 18.6%, 33.5% and 37.5% lower for NOx, SO2 and O3, respectively. The spatial patterns demonstrated that higher NOx concentrations often appeared in cities such as Guangzhou, Foshan and Shenzhen. SO2 concentrations were higher in west and lower in east. High SO2 concentrations are mainly from emission of power plants and industrial sources. Concentrations of O3 showed the highest levels in the south of PRD. Backward trajectory analysis for higher ozone areas indicated that 53% of the air masses were from the region with high concentration of NOx. The horizontal transportation caused higher ozone in the south while lower in north in PRD.",

Results were shown as follows, acetone was found to be the most predominant carbonyls followed by formaldehyde, 2-butone and acetaldehyde, with the 24 h average concentrations of 10.84, 9.29, 8.35, 8.0 microg x m(-3) respectively, which accounted for 72.29% of total carbonyl compounds in the atmosphere. Among the four sites, the highest level of total carbonyl compounds was 59.66 microg x m(-3) at the urban site of Guangdong Provincial Centre of Environmental Monitor, the lowest was 43.51 microg x m(-3) at the rural site of Conghua. Different variation characterizations of each carbonyl compounds at there different height sites were found, and the diurnal variation was shown that the total concentration of carbonyl compounds in daytime was much higher than that of nighttime. Good correlations between formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone indicated that they mainly derived from the same sources, and the value that C1/C2 and C2/C3 ratios were 1.12 and 7.51 respectively implied that the important pollution sources of carbonyl compounds was vehicular exhaust in Guangzhou.",

        "title": "Volatile organic compounds at a rural site in Beijing: influence of temporary emission control and wintertime heating",
        "abstract": "Abstract.  While residential coal/biomass burning might be a major and underappreciatedemission source for PM  2.5  , especially during winter, it is notwell constrained whether burning solid fuels contributes substantially toambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are precursors to secondaryorganic aerosols (SOAs) that typically have a higher contribution toparticulate matter during winter haze events. In this study, ambient airsamples were collected in 2014 from 25\u00a0October to 31\u00a0December at a ruralsite on the campus of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)in northeastern Beijing for the analysis of VOCs. Since temporaryintervention measures were implemented on 3\u201312\u00a0November to improve the airquality for the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit held on5\u201311\u00a0November in Beijing, and wintertime central heating started on 15\u00a0November in Beijing after the APEC summit, this sample collection periodprovided a good opportunity to study the influence of temporary controlmeasures and wintertime heating on ambient VOCs. As a result of thetemporary intervention measures implemented during 3\u201312\u00a0November (periodII), the total mixing ratios of non-methane hydrocarbons averaged 11.25\u202fppb,approximately 50\u202f% lower than the values of 23.41\u202fppb in period I (25\u00a0October\u20132\u00a0November) and 21.71\u202fppb in period III (13\u00a0November\u201331\u00a0December).The ozone and SOA formation potentials decreased by  \u223c50 \u202f%and  \u223c70 \u202f%, respectively, during period II relative toperiod I, with the larger decrease in SOA formation potentials attributed tomore effective control over aromatic hydrocarbons mainly from solvent use.Back trajectory analysis revealed that the average mixing ratios of VOCs insoutherly air masses were 2.3, 2.3 and 2.9 times those in northerly airmasses during periods I, II and III, respectively; all VOC episodes occurredunder the influence of southerly winds, suggesting much stronger emissionsin the southern urbanized regions than in the northern rural areas. Based ona positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model, the alteredcontributions from traffic emissions and solvent use could explain 47.9\u202f%and 37.6\u202f% of the reduction in ambient VOCs, respectively, during periodII relative to period I, indicating that the temporary control measures onvehicle emissions and solvent use were effective at lowering the ambientlevels of VOCs. Coal/biomass burning, gasoline exhaust and industrialemissions were among the major sources, and they altogether contributed60.3\u202f%, 78.6\u202f% and 78.7\u202f% of the VOCs during periods I, II andIII, respectively. Coal/biomass burning, mostly residential coal burning,became the dominant source, accounting for 45.1\u202f% of the VOCs during thewintertime heating period, with a specifically lower average contributionpercentage in southerly air masses (38.2\u202f%) than in northerly air  masses(48.8\u202f%). The results suggest that emission control in the industry andtraffic sectors is more effective in lowering ambient reactive VOCs innon-heating seasons; however, during the winter heating season reducingemissions from residential burning of solid fuels would be of greaterimportance and would have health co-benefits from lowering both indoor andoutdoor air pollution.",

        "title": "Chemical composition, sources, and aging process of submicron aerosols in Beijing: Contrast between summer and winter",
        "abstract": "To investigate the seasonal characteristics of submicron aerosol (PM1) in Beijing urban areas, a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol-mass-spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) was utilized at an urban site in summer (August to September 2011) and winter (November to December 2010), coupled with multiple state of the art online instruments. The average mass concentrations of PM1 (60\u201384\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123) and its chemical compositions in different campaigns of Beijing were relatively consistent in recent years. In summer, the daily variations of PM1 mass concentrations were stable and repeatable. Eighty-two percent of the PM1 mass concentration on average was composed of secondary species, where 62% is secondary inorganic aerosol and 20% secondary organic aerosol (SOA). In winter, PM1 mass concentrations changed dramatically because of the different meteorological conditions. The high average fraction (58%) of primary species in PM1 including primary organic aerosol (POA), black carbon, and chloride indicates primary emissions usually played a more important role in the winter. However, aqueous chemistry resulting in efficient secondary formation during occasional periods with high relative humidity may also contribute substantially to haze in winter. Results of past OA source apportionment studies in Beijing show 45\u201367% of OA in summer and 22\u201350% of OA in winter can be composed of SOA. Based on the source apportionment results, we found 45% POA in winter and 61% POA in summer are from nonfossil sources, contributed by cooking OA in both seasons and biomass burning OA (BBOA) in winter. Cooking OA, accounting for 13\u201324% of OA, is an important nonfossil carbon source in all years of Beijing and should not be neglected. The fossil sources of POA include hydrocarbon-like OA from vehicle emissions in both seasons and coal combustion OA (CCOA) in winter. The CCOA and BBOA were the two main contributors (57% of OA) for the highest OA concentrations (u003e100\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123) in winter. The POA/\u0394CO ratios in winter and summer are 11 and 16\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123\u2009ppm\u22121, respectively, similar to ratios from western cities. Higher OOA/Ox (=\u2009NO2\u2009+\u2009O3) ratio (0.49\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123\u2009ppb\u22121) in winter study than these ratios from western cities (0.03\u20130.16\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123\u2009ppb\u22121) was observed, which may be due to the aqueous reaction or extra SOA formation contributed by semivolatile organic compounds from various primary sources (e.g., BBOA or CCOA) in Beijing. The evolution of oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) with photochemical age allows to estimate an equivalent rate constant for chemical aging of OA in summer as kOH\u2009~\u20094.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221212\u2009cm3\u2009molecule\u22121\u2009s\u22121, which is of the same order as obtained in other anthropogenic influenced areas and may be useful for OA modeling.",

        "abstract": "This paper applies advance receptor model positive matrix factorization (PMF) source analysis to 1-h resolution VOC data collected at Yufa (rural site) and Peking University, or PKU (urban site), in Beijing. A range of major VOC sources was identified, including vehicle emissions, liquefied petroleum gas, coal combustion, and biogenic emissions. Vehicle activities contributed approximately 62% of VOC loading and 55% of ozone forming potential at the PKU site, compared to 38% of VOC loading and 42% of ozone forming potential at Yufa. These results indicate that the control of vehicle emissions is essential to alleviating VOC pollution, particularly in urban Beijing. We found that VOC emission strengths are relatively consistent throughout the day in the rural area; variation of mixing height therefore is a controlling factor for ground-level VOC concentration. In the urban area, both vehicle activity and variation of mixing height strongly impact VOC levels. Local sources within Beijing appeared to contribute most of the VOCs recorded at both urban and rural areas. However, as some of the VOC species are quite reactive, VOC emitted from distant sources would have been depleted during transportation, concurrent with the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone and sulfate. Such depletion would mean that this source apportionment analysis would tend to overestimate the ozone forming capacity of local VOC sources compared to emissions from distant sources. Nevertheless, this study illustrates that high-resolution VOC measurements, especially those with a sampling frequency on the scale of less than 1 day, combined with PMF, can make a strong contribution to our understanding of pollutant emissions and transport characteristics and is a useful tool with which to formulate effective pollution control strategies.",

        "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOC) ratios in urban atmosphere could provide important information on VOC data quality, sources, and options for removal processes. Based on seven VOC measurement datasets, useful VOC ratios were calculated using four methods, including orthogonal distance(ODR), linear regression, geometric mean, mean, and frequency distribution. Ambient levels of -xylene and -xylene from the seven datasets showed good correlation with  ranging from 0.975 to 0.997, and their ratios (-xylene/-xylene) were close, with values of 2.78-3.05, indicating therefore that the ratio of -xylene/-xylene could be used to evaluate the quality of ambient measurement data in urban atmospheres. In addition, ratios of toluene  benzene (T/B) and propane  ethane (P/E) in different cities were compared, to investigate VOC sources in China. The highest T/B ratios were found in Shanghai and Guangzhou City, with values of 2.37 and 1.78, respectively, higher than the result from a tunnel study (1.52), suggesting the important influence of paint and solvent use. The T/B value for Beijing City during summer was close to that from the tunnel study, while the T/B ratios for Chengdu, Beijing during winter, and Chongqing were lower, with values ranging from 0.744 to 1.36, suggesting possible influences from biomass burning and coal combustion. The P/E value in Guangzhou was 1.27, significantly higher than the range of 0.270 to 0.645 found in other cities. The OH exposure in different cities were calculated based on -xylene/ethylbenzene (X/E), with values ranging from 2.70\u00d710 to 4.45\u00d710 molecule\u00b7cm\u00b7s.",

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a key role in atmospheric chemistry.Emission and deposition on soilhave been suggested as important sources and sinks of atmospheric tracegases.

We used a newly designed differentialcoated-wall flow tube system to investigate the long-term variability ofbidirectional air\u2013soil exchange of 13 VOCs under ambient air conditions ofan urban background site in Beijing. Sterilized soil was investigated toaddress physicochemical processes and heterogeneous/multiphase reactionsindependently from biological activity. Most VOCs revealed net depositionwith average uptake coefficients (  \u03b3  ) in the range of10  \u22127  \u201310  \u22126   (referring to the geometric soil surface area),corresponding to deposition velocities (  V  d  ) of0.0013\u20130.01\u2009cm\u2009s  \u22121   and soil surface resistances (  R   c   ) of98\u2013745\u2009s\u2009cm  \u22121  , respectively.

The soil\u2013atmosphere exchange of one individual VOC species canbe affected by both its surface degradation/depletion caused by surfacereactions and by competitive uptake or heterogeneous formation/accommodationof other VOC species. Overall, the results show that physicochemicalprocessing and heterogeneous oxidation on soil and soil-derived dust can actas a sink or as a source of atmospheric VOCs, depending on molecularproperties and environmental conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Nitryl chloride (ClNO 2 ) is a dominant source of chlorine radical in polluted environment, and can significantly affect the atmospheric oxidative chemistry. However, the abundance of ClNO 2  and its exact role are not fully understood under different environmental conditions. During the summer of 2014, we deployed a chemical ionization mass spectrometer to measure ClNO 2  and dinitrogen pentoxide (N 2 O 5 ) at a rural site in the polluted North China Plain. Elevated mixing ratios of ClNO 2  (u003e  350  pptv) were observed at most of the nights with low levels of N 2 O 5  (  200  pptv). The highest ClNO 2  mixing ratio of 2070  pptv (1  min average) was observed in a plume from a megacity (Tianjin), and was characterized with a faster N 2 O 5  heterogeneous loss rate and ClNO 2  production rate compared to average conditions. The abundant ClNO 2  concentration kept increasing even after sunrise, and reached a peak 4  h later. Such highly sustained ClNO 2  peaks after sunrise are discrepant from the previously observed typical diurnal pattern. Meteorological and chemical analysis shows that the sustained ClNO 2  morning peaks are caused by significant ClNO 2  production in the residual layer at night followed by downward mixing after breakup of the nocturnal inversion layer in the morning. We estimated that \u2009\u223c\u2009  1.7\u20134.0  ppbv of ClNO 2  would exist in the residual layer in order to maintain the observed morning ClNO 2  peaks at the surface site. Observation-based box model analysis show that photolysis of ClNO 2  produced chlorine radical with a rate up to 1.12  ppbv  h \u22121 , accounting for 10\u201330  % of primary RO  x   production in the morning hours. The perturbation in total radical production leads to an increase of integrated daytime net ozone production by 3  % (4.3  ppbv) on average, and with a larger increase of 13  % (11  ppbv) in megacity outflow that was characterized with higher ClNO 2  and a relatively lower oxygenated hydrocarbon (OVOC) to non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) ratio.",

The field campaign \u201cBeijing winter finE particle STudy \u2013 Oxidation, Nucleation and light Extinctions\u201d (BEST-ONE) was conducted at the suburban site Huairou near Beijing from January to March 2016. It aimed to understand oxidative capacity during wintertime and to elucidate the secondary pollutants formation mechanism in the North China Plain (NCP). OH radical concentrations at noontime ranged from 2.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6 \u2009cm \u22123  in severely polluted air ( k  OH \u2009~\u200927\u2009s \u22121 ) to 3.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6 \u2009cm \u22123  in relatively clean air ( k  OH \u2009~\u20095\u2009s \u22121 ). These values are nearly two-fold larger than OH concentrations observed in previous winter campaign in Birmingham, Tokyo, and New York City. During this campaign, the total primary production rate of RO x  radicals was dominated by the photolysis of nitrous acid accounting for 46\u2009% of the identified primary production pathways for RO x  radicals. Other important radical sources were alkene ozonolysis (28\u2009%) and photolysis of oxygenated organic compounds (24\u2009%). A box model was used to simulate the OH, HO 2  and RO 2  concentrations based on the observations of their long-lived precursors. The model was capable of reproducing the observed diurnal variation of the OH and peroxy radicals during clean days with a factor of 1.5. However, it largely underestimated HO 2  and RO 2  concentrations by factors up to 5 during pollution episodes. The HO 2  and RO 2  observed-to-modeled ratios increased with increasing NO concentrations, indicating a deficit in our understanding of the gas-phase chemistry in the high NO x  regime. The OH concentrations observed in the presence of large OH reactivities indicate that atmospheric trace gas oxidation by photochemical processes can be highly effective even during wintertime, thereby facilitating the vigorous formation of secondary pollutants.",

        "title": "Experimental budgets of OH, HO 2 and RO 2 radicals and implications for ozone formation in the Pearl River Delta in China 2014",
        "abstract": "Abstract.  Hydroxyl (OH) and peroxy radicals (HO 2 , RO 2 ) were measured in the Pearl River Delta which is one of the most polluted areas in China, in autumn 2014. The radical observations were complemented by measurements of OH reactivity (inverse OH lifetime) and a comprehensive set of trace gases including CO, NO  x   and VOCs. OH reactivity was in the range between 15  s \u22121  and 80  s \u22121 , of which about 50  % was unexplained by the measured OH reactants. In the three weeks of the campaign, maximum median radical concentrations were 4.5  \u00d7  10 6   cm \u22123  for OH at noon, and 3  \u00d7  10 8   cm \u22123  and 2.0  \u00d7  10 8   cm \u22123  for HO 2  and RO 2 , respectively, in the early afternoon. The completeness of the daytime radical measurements made it possible to carry out experimental budget analyses for all radicals (OH, HO 2 , and RO 2 ) and their sum (RO  x  ). The maximum loss rates for OH, HO 2 , and RO 2  reached values between 10  ppbv/h and 15  ppbv/h during daytime. The largest fraction of this can be attributed to radical interconveresio reactions while the real loss rate of RO  x   remained below 3  ppbv/h. Within experimental uncertainties, the destruction rates of HO 2  and the sum of OH, HO 2 , and RO 2  are balanced by their respective production rates. In case of RO 2 , the budget can only be closed when the missing OH reactivity is attributed to unmeasured VOCs. Thus, the existence of unmeasured VOCs is directly confirmed by RO 2  measurements. Although the closure of the RO 2  budget is greatly improved by the additional unmeasured VOCs, a significant imbalance in the afternoon remains indicating a missing RO 2  sink. In case of OH, the destruction in the morning is compensated by the quantified OH sources from photolysis (HONO, O 3 ), ozonolysis of alkenes and OH recycling (HO 2   +  NO). In the afternoon, however, the OH budget indicates a missing OH source of (4\u20136)  ppbv/h. The diurnal variation of the missing OH source shows a similar pattern as that of the missing RO 2  sink so that both largely compensate each other in the RO  x   budget. These observations suggest the existence of a chemical mechanism that converts RO 2  to OH without the involvement of NO. The photochemical net ozone production rate calculated from the reaction of HO 2  and RO 2  with NO yields a daily integrated amount of 102  ppbv ozone with daily integrated RO  x   primary sources being 22  ppbv in this campaign. This value can be attributed to the oxidation of measured (18  %) and unmeasured (60  %) hydrocarbons, formaldehyde (14  %) and CO (8  %). An even larger integrated net ozone production of 140  ppbv would be calculated from the oxidation rate of VOCs with OH, if HO 2  and all RO 2  radicals would react with NO. However, the unknown RO 2  loss (evident in the RO 2  budget) causes 30  % less ozone production than would be expected from the VOC oxidation rate.",

        "abstract": "Total OH reactivity measurements were conducted on the Peking University campus (Beijing) in August 2013 and in Heshan (Guangdong province) from October to November 2014. The daily median OH reactivity was 20\u202f\u00b1\u202f11\u202fs^(\u22121) in Beijing and 31\u202f\u00b1\u202f20\u202fs^(\u22121) in Heshan, respectively. The data in Beijing showed a distinct diurnal pattern with the maxima over 27\u202fs^(\u22121) in the early morning and minima below 16\u202fs^(\u22121) in the afternoon. The diurnal pattern in Heshan was not as evident as in Beijing. Missing reactivity, defined as the difference between measured and calculated OH reactivity, was observed at both sites, with 21\u202f% missing reactivity in Beijing and 32\u202f% missing reactivity in Heshan. Unmeasured primary species, such as branched alkenes, could contribute to missing reactivity in Beijing, especially during morning rush hours. An observation-based model with the RACM2 (Regional Atmospheric Chemical Mechanism version 2) was used to understand the daytime missing reactivity in Beijing by adding unmeasured oxygenated volatile organic compounds and simulated intermediates of the degradation from primary volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the model could not find a convincing explanation for the missing reactivity in Heshan, where the ambient air was found to be more aged, and the missing reactivity was presumably attributed to oxidized species, such as unmeasured aldehydes, acids and dicarbonyls. The ozone production efficiency was 21\u202f% higher in Beijing and 30\u202f% higher in Heshan when the model was constrained by the measured reactivity, compared to the calculations with measured and modeled species included, indicating the importance of quantifying the OH reactivity for better understanding ozone chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The current state of quantifying uncertainty in chemical transport models (CTM) is often limited and insufficient due to numerous uncertainty sources and inefficient or inaccurate uncertainty propagation methods. In this study, we proposed a feasible methodological framework for CTM uncertainty analysis, featuring sensitivity analysis to filter for important model inputs and a new reduced-form model (RFM) that couples the High-order Decoupled Direct Method (HDDM) and the Stochastic Response Surface Model (SRSM) to boost uncertainty propagation. Compared with the SRSM, the new RFM approach is 64% more computationally efficient while maintaining high accuracy. The framework was applied to PM2.5 simulations in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, and found five precursor emissions, two species in lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) and three meteorological inputs out of 203 model inputs to be important model inputs based on sensitivity analysis. Among these selected inputs, primary PM2.5 emissions, PM2.5 concentrations of LBCs and wind speed were identified as key uncertainty sources, which contributed to 81.4% of the total uncertainty in PM2.5 simulations when combined. Also, when evaluated against observations, we found that there were systematic underestimates in PM2.5 simulations, which can be attributed to the two-product method that describes the formation of secondary organic aerosol.",

        "abstract": "Particulate matter emissions from a series of different Chinese coal combustion systems were collected and analyzed for elemental and organic carbon (EC, OC), and molecular markers. Emissions from both industrial boilers and residential stoves were investigated. The coal used in this study included anthracite, bituminite, and brown coal, as well as commonly used coal briquettes produced in China for residential coal combustion. Results show significant differences in the contribution of carbonaceous species to particulate mass emissions. Industrial boilers had much higher burn out of carbon yielding particulate matter emissions with much lower levels of OC, EC, and speciated organic compounds, while residential stoves had significantly higher emissions of carbonaceous particulate matter with emission rates of approximately 100 times higher than that of industrial boilers. Quantified organic compounds emitted from industrial boilers were dominated by oxygenated compounds, of which 46-68% were organic acids, whereas the dominate species quantified in the emissions from residential stoves were PAHs (38%) and n-alkanes (20%). An important observation was the fact that emission factors of PAHs and the distribution of hopanoids were different among the emissions from industrial and residential coal combustion even using the same coal for combustion. Although particulate matter emissions from industrial and residential combustion were different in many regards, picene was detected in all samples with detectable OC mass concentrations, which supports the use of this organic tracer for OC from all types of coal combustion. 17alpha(H),21beta(H)-29-norhopane was the predominant hopanoid in coal combustion emissions, which is different from mobile source emissions and may be used to distinguish emissions from these different fossil fuel sources.",

        "abstract": "We analyze the observations of near-surface peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) and its precursors in Beijing, China in August of 2007. The levels of PAN are remarkably high (up to 14 ppbv), surpassing those measured over other urban regions in recent years. Analyses employing a 1-D version of a chemical transport model (Regional chEmical and trAnsport Model, REAM) indicate that aromatic non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) are the dominant (55-75%) PAN source. The major oxidation product of aromatics that produces acetyl peroxy radicals is methylglyoxal (MGLY). PAN and O(3) in the observations are correlated at daytime; aromatic NMHCs appear to play an important role in O(3) photochemistry. Previous NMHC measurements indicate the presence of reactive aromatics at high levels over broad polluted regions of China. Aromatics are often ignored in global and (to a lesser degree) regional 3D photochemical transport models; their emissions over China as well as photochemistry are quite uncertain. Our findings suggest that critical assessments of aromatics emissions and chemistry (such as the yields of MGLY) are necessary to understand and assess ozone photochemistry and regional pollution export in China.",

        "abstract": "Naphthalene (Nap) and methylnaphthalene (MN) are the most abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in atmosphere, and have been proposed to be important precursors of anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) derived from laboratory chamber experiments. In this study, atmospheric Nap/MN and their gas-phase photooxidation products were quantified by a Proton Transfer Reaction-Quadrupole interface Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-QiTOF) during the 2016 winter in Beijing. Phthalic anhydride, a late generation product from Nap under high-NOx conditions, appeared to be more prominent than 2-formylcinnamaldehyde (early generation product), possibly due to more sufficient oxidation during the haze. 1,2-phthalic acid (1,2-PhA), the hydrated form of phthalic anhydride, was capable of partitioning into aerosol phase and served as a tracer to explore the contribution of Nap to ambient SOA. The measured fraction in particle phase (Fp) of 1,2-PhA averaged at 73\u00b113% with OA mass loadings of 52.5-87.8 \u03bcg/m3, lower than the value predicted by the absorptive partitioning model (100%). Using tracer product-based and precursor consumption-based methods, 2-ring PAHs (Nap and MN) were estimated to produce 14.9% (an upper limit) of the SOA formed in the afternoon during the wintertime haze, suggesting a comparable contribution of Nap and MN with monocyclic-aromatics on urban SOA formation.",

Then chemical mass balance model was run to calculate their source apportionment in the atmosphere of PRD. The results showed that there didn't exist the profile with single molecular mark at all in PRD, but the complex multi-linearity emission sources could be identified by the VOCs characteristic profiles with consideration on the uncertainty of atmospheric chemical reactions, pollutants diffusion and deposition and sources loss, etc. The sources apportionment of VOCs in PRD were mobile sources 15.0%, stationary industries 29.4%, area sources 25.7% and unidentified sources 29.9% . In 2002, stationary sources and mobile sources were the most important to be controlled by government, however, area sources was troublesome.",

In this work, VOCs source characteristics of ship container, shipbuilding, wood, and automobile painting industry were measured using canister-GC-MS/FID analysis system. The results showed that VOCs emitted from these industrial sectors were mainly aromatics, such as toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene, accounting for 79%-99% of total VOCs. The VOCs treatment facilities of activated carbon adsorption had little impact on changing the composition patterns of VOCs, while catalytic combustion treatments produced more alkenes. The combustion treatment of VOCs changed the maximum increment reactivity (MIR) of the VOCs emissions, and was thus very likely to change the ozone formation potentials.",

Up to 50 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) species were quantified by using GC-FID/MS. Vertical profiles of VOCs and their chemical speciation were analyzed and influence of local emissions and regional transport on the measured VOCs was studied. VOCs concentration decreased significantly with the increase of altitude. The different vertical patterns of VOCs species were due to their atmospheric chemical reactivities, while atmospheric diffusion and long range transport might also affect the vertical distribution of VOCs. By investigating the backward trajectories and the variation of the relative abundance of long-lived VOCs species, the airborne VOCs were found to be mainly from the diffusion of local emissions, and also influenced by the plume transported from eastern and southern regions, e.g. Tianjin and Langfang cities, under some conditions.",

        "abstract": "In China, fast increase in passenger cars and gasoline consumption with yet quite limited vapor recovery during gasoline distribution has procured growing concern about gasoline evaporation as an important emission source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particularly in megacities hard-hit by air quality problems. This study presents VOC species profiles related to major pathways of gasoline evaporative loss in China, including headspace displacement, refueling operations and spillage/leakage. Apart from liquid gasoline and headspace vapors, gasoline vapors emitted when refueling cars in service stations or tank trucks in oil marketing depots were also sampled in situ with vapor recovery units (VRUs) turning on/off. Alkanes, alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons accounted for 55-66, 21-35 and 4-8% in refueling vapors, 59-72, 18-28 and 4-10% in headspace vapors and 33-51, 8-15 and 38-48% in liquid gasoline samples, respectively. During refueling with VRUs turning on, total VOCs in vapors were less than one fifth of that with VRUs turning off, and aromatic hydrocarbons had higher weight percentages of about 8% in contrast with that of about 4% during refueling with VRUs turning off. Refueling vapors, especially for that with VRUs turning off, showed a larger fraction of light hydrocarbons including C3-C5 light alkenes when compared to headspace vapors, probably due to splashing and disturbance during filling operation. In refueling or headspace vapors the ratios of i-pentane/benzene, i-pentane/toluene, and MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether)/benzene ranged 8.7-57, 2.7-4.8, and 1.9-6.6, respectively; and they are distinctively much higher than those previously reported in vehicle exhausts. Calculated normalized reactivity or ozone formation potential of the gasoline vapors in China ranged 3.3-4.4g O3g-1 VOC, about twice that of gasoline headspace vapors reported in USA as a result of larger fractions of alkenes in China's gasoline vapors. The results suggested that reducing VOC emission from gasoline distribution sector would particularly benefit ground-level ozone control in China. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "title": "Estimating halocarbon emissions using measured ratio relative to tracers in China",
        "abstract": "China is one of the most important halocarbons emitters in the world. However, differences exist in the compiled national emissions inventories (bottom-up) with those derived from ambient measurements (top-down). In this study, CO and 15 halocarbon species including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), CCl4, CH3CCl3 and other halogenated solvents were measured in 47 cities and using aircraft over Shandong Peninsula during 2010-2011 for China. Halocarbon species with concentrations 20% higher than that of global background levels were considered to have their local emissions; these species were chosen for developing emissions estimates using tracer ratios method. Three tracers namely CO, HCFC-22 and benzene were used to examine correlations with halocarbons in this work; HCFC-22 combined with benzene as multi-tracers showed better correlations than CO did. Halocarbon emissions were estimated using tracer emission multiplied by Halo/Tracer obtained from measured data. The calculated results revealed that HCFC-22 emission based on CO tracer was the largest ozone depletion substance (ODS) at 129.3Gg/year; Solvent halocarbon species such as CH3Cl, CHCl3, CH2Cl2, C2HCl3, C2Cl4, etc., mainly used as solvents but not under control accounted for 79% in total halocarbon emissions. Comparisons of the tracer ratio emission estimates have been made with other emissions inventories. Results from this study showed our emission estimates for CFC-11 and CFC-12 were 80%~85% and 120%~430% of emission inventories respectively. Also the recently phased-out species of CCl4 and CH3CCl3 were 586%-1173% and 330%-660% of the emission inventories respectively. The estimated emissions from the different studies for China during 2000-2010 were summarized. It was shown that HCFC-22 increased by 49.1% accompanied with CFC-12 decreasing by 48.9% during 2007-2010 and a significant decrease trend in CH3CCl3 emission which dropped from 6.5Gg/year in 2001 to 2.1Gg/year in 2010. ? 2014.",

        "abstract": "For CareBeijing-2006, two sites were established in urban and suburban regions of Beijing in summer 2006. Observations of O3 and its precursors together with meteorological parameters at both sites are presented. Gross ozone production rate P(O3) and sensitivity to nitric oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were investigated using an observation-based photochemical box model (OBM). P(O3) varied from nearly zero to 120 and 50 ppb h\u22121 for urban and suburban sites, respectively. These rates were greater than the accumulation rates of the observed oxidant (O3 + NO2) concentrations. The O3 episodes typically appeared under southerly wind conditions with high P(O3), especially at the urban site. Sensitivity studies with and without measured nitrous acid (HONO) as a model constraint suggested that the estimated P(O3) at both sites was strongly enhanced by radical production from HONO photolysis. Both NOx- and VOC-sensitive chemistries existed over time scales from hours to days at the two sites. The variation in O3-sensitive chemistry was relatively well explained by the ratio of the average daytime total VOC reactivity (kTVOC) to NO, with the transition chemistry corresponding to a kTVOC/NO value of 2\u20134 s\u22121 ppb\u22121. Pronounced diurnal variations in the O3 production regime were found. In the morning, conditions were always strongly VOC-limited, while in the afternoon, conditions were variable for different days and different sites. The model-calculated results were tested by measurements of H2O2, HNO3, total OH reactivity, and HOx radicals. The OBM was generally capable of correctly simulating the levels of P(O3), although it might tend to overpredict the VOC-sensitive chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The Parties to the Montreal Protocol are informed by three Panels of experts. One of these is the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP), which deals with two focal issues. The first focus is the effects of UV radiation on human health, animals, plants, biogeochemistry, air quality, and materials. The second focus is on interactions between UV radiation and global climate change and how these may affect humans and the environment. When considering the effects of climate change, it has become clear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously believed. As a result of this, human health and environmental issues will be longer-lasting and more regionally variable. Like the other Panels, the EEAP produces a detailed report every four years; the most recent was published as a series of seven papers in 2015 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2015, 14, 1-184). In the years in between, the EEAP produces less detailed and shorter Progress Reports of the relevant scientific findings. The most recent of these was for 2015 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2016, 15, 141-147). The present Progress Report for 2016 assesses some of the highlights and new insights with regard to the interactive nature of the direct and indirect effects of UV radiation, atmospheric processes, and climate change. The more detailed Quadrennial Assessment will be made available in 2018.",

        "abstract": "High HONO level during daytime was observed at a rural site Xinken in southeastern China during the 2004 Program of Regional Integrated Experiments of Air Quality over Pear River Delta (PRIDE-PRD). The high HONO concentration led to a daytime (9:00\u201315:00) OH formation up to three times faster than that from O3 photolysis. An unexplained daytime HONO source, approximately four times faster than the reaction of OH with NO, has been derived from the HONO budget estimation. According to current understanding, this unknown source was attributed to heterogeneous reactions of NO2 on ground and aerosol surfaces. The good correlation between the unknown source and J values is consistent with the photolytic HONO source observed in laboratory studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Air pollution associated with atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5, i.e., particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5mm or less) is a serious problem in Beijing, China. To provide a better understanding of the sources contributing to PM2.5, 24-h samples were collected at 6-day intervals in January, April, July, and October in 2000 at five locations in the Beijing metropolitan,area. Both backward,trajectory and elemental analyses identified two dust storm events; the distinctly low value of Ca:Si (o0.2) and,high Al:Ca (41.7) in Beijing PM2.5 appear,indicative of contributions,from,dust storms. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to apportion sources of PM2.5, and eight sources were identified: biomass burning (11%), secondary sulfates (17%), secondary nitrates (14%), coal combustion (19%), industry (6%), motor vehicles (6%), road dust (9%), and yellow dust. The lower organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), SO4 2\ufffd , and Ca values of yellow dust enable it to be distinguished,from,road,dust. The PMF method,resolved 82% of PM2.5 mass concentrations,and,showed,excellent agreement,with a previous,calculation using organic,tracers in a chemical,mass balance (CMB) model. The present study is the first reported,comparison,between,a PMF source apportionment,model and,a molecular,marker-based,CMB in Beijing. r,2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

        "abstract": "To investigate the atmospheric oxidizing capacity in certain polluted isoprene-rich environments, such as the forests surrounding megacities. Here we present online observations of isoprene and its first-stage oxidation products methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR) in summer 2016 at a remote, high-altitude mountain forest site (1690\u2009m\u2009a.s.l.) to the north of the air-polluted Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in southern China. The observed isoprene level was found to be significantly lower in comparison with other forest sites either in China or around the world, although the sampling site was surrounded with subtropical evergreen broad-leaved trees which are strong isoprene emitters. Also, high (MVK+MACR)/isoprene ratio was observed. Based on the observations, we hypothesized that the lower isoprene levels in the study forest might be attributable to a strong atmospheric oxidative capacity in relation to the elevated regional complex air pollution. High daytime OH and nighttime NO 3  radical concentrations estimated by using a photochemical box model incorporating Master Chemical Mechanism (PBM-MCM), as well as calculated short atmospheric reaction times of isoprene and long photochemical age, indicated that the isoprene was rapidly and fully oxidized at this aged atmospheric environment, which confirmed our hypothesis. The study suggests that the complex air pollution in the PRD region has significantly elevated the background atmospheric oxidative capacity of the adjacent forests, and most likely does would probably affect the regional air quality and ecological environment in the long term. The feedback of forest ecosystems to the increasing atmospheric oxidation capacity warrants further studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  To investigate the atmospheric oxidative capacity (AOC) in forested highmountain areas adjacent to the photochemistry-active Pearl River Delta (PRD)region in southern China, one-month online observations of isoprene and itsoxidation products methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR) wereconducted at a national background station in Nanling Mountains in summer2016. The results showed that the observed daytime isoprene levels ( 377\u00b146   pptv) were significantly lower in comparison with other forest siteswithin and outside China, although the sampling site was surrounded withsubtropical evergreen broad-leaved trees which are strong isoprene emitters.Also, high daytime (MVK   +   MACR)   \u2215   isoprene ratios ( 1.9\u00b10.5 )were observed. Based on the observations, we hypothesized that the lowerisoprene levels in the study forest might be attributable to a strong AOC inrelation to the elevated regional complex air pollution. In further dataanalyses, high site-level concentrations of daytime OH (    7.3  \u00b1  0.5  \u00d7   10  6            molecules  cm  \u22123 )  and nighttime  NO 3   radicals (    6.0  \u00b1  0.5  \u00d7   10  8            molecules  cm  \u22123 )  were estimated by using aphotochemical box model incorporating the master chemical mechanism(PBM-MCM), and high regional mixing ratios of OH (    19.7  \u00b1  2.3  \u00d7   10  6            molecules  cm  \u22123 )  during 09:00\u201315:00  LT were also obtained byapplying a parameterization method with measured aromatic hydrocarbons. Andbesides, high initial mixing ratios ( 1213\u00b1108   pptv) and shortatmospheric reaction time (0.27  h) of isoprene during the day were derivedby a sequential reaction approach. All these indicate that isoprene wasrapidly and highly oxidized in this forest, which supports our hypothesis.The study suggests that the complex air pollution in the PRD may havesignificantly elevated the background AOC of the adjacent forests, andprobably affects the regional air quality and ecological environment in thelong term. The feedback of forest ecosystems to the increasing AOC insouthern China warrants further studies.",

        "abstract": "In this letter, the surface climate temperature trends for the land and the oceans (land\u2013ocean warming contrast) have been examined and compared based on five data sets. The five data sets included three reconstructed data sets of surface temperature observations and two data sets derived using the satellite microwave sounding unit retrieval products in the lower troposphere (LT) for the period from January 1980 to December 2014. Unlike previous studies, the current study shows that the warming trends significantly decreased over both the land and ocean since 1992 and reached their minimum (near zero) in the early 2000s, which is consistent with the occurrence of the warming hiatus. However, due to the sharp decrease in the surface warming trend over the land (1992 to 2007) in conjunction with an increase in the ocean surface warming trend after 2002, the combined trend carries an overall positive sign (between 2005 and 2007) due to the greater ocean warming trend. The rate of warming increase in the ocean, which began in 2002, is surprisingly fast and is approaching the highest warming trends observed over the land since 1980. These basic land and ocean trend results are confirmed by all five data sets with slightly different values due to the various techniques used in compiling the data sets. However, there is consistency in the overall trend pattern results.",

        "abstract": "The decadal variability of sea surface temperature SST and sea level pressure SLP anomalies, as well as the response of global land vegetation and marine fisheries, are investigated for three periods: 1982\u20131988, 1989\u20131998, and 1999\u20132008, separated by the 1988\u201389 and 1998\u201399 regime shifts. The goal is to develop a global-scale ecosystem concept to support an improved understanding of the corresponding changes in atmospheric, oceanic, and biological responses. The analysis is based on global SST, SLP, precipitable water content PWC, land vegetation condition index VCI, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s FAO fish capture data. The results show that SST and SLP displayed significant decadal variability. The decadal variability of sea surface temperature anomalies SSTA associated with sea level pressure anomalies SLPA has an influence on the land vegetation moisture condition VCI. Positive SSTA tends to be associated with negative SLPA, and vice versa, in the corresponding ocean areas and most land areas. Consequently, clearly opposing distributions of SSTA and SLPA are observed in the periods 1982\u20131988 and 1999\u20132008. With positive SSTA and negative SLPA, VCI tends to increase in value representing more favourable vegetation conditions. Negative SSTA and positive SLPA is generally unfavourable for global vegetation development. The decadal variability of SSTA is closely related to the number of fish species NFS doing better or worse based on normalized fish landing data. However, the fishery responses show different yet consistent trends in the three ocean basins. When SSTA is negative, it appears more beneficial for the number of fish species with improved landings in the Atlantic Ocean. However, positive SSTA leads to more fish species with improved landings in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.",

        "abstract": "The thermal and dynamical causes of boundary layer low-level jets (LLJs) over the southeast coast of China (a very complex terrain) are explored using a very high-resolution diagnostic model CALMET along with the advanced weather research and forecasting (WRF-ARW) model, combined with observations. Both diurnal and seasonal variations in LLJs are investigated using simulations during two observational periods and four months in 2011. Two configurations, with different vertical and horizontal resolutions, are compared. The results show that the use of higher vertical and horizontal resolutions (including land cover/use) in the diagnostic model CALMET leads to large improvements in simulating boundary layer LLJs over complex terrain as compared with using lower vertical and horizontal resolutions in both WRF-ARW and CALMET models. The simulations using the diagnostic model CALMET better reproduced the observations, in that both LLJ events occur in the night (nocturnal LLJs) and in the afternoon (afternoon LLJs) are noticed. Compared to the nocturnal LLJs, the afternoon LLJs have larger wind speeds and occur at lower heights. The afternoon LLJ characteristics are closely associated with local thermodynamic circulations including the mountain\u2013valley breeze and land\u2013ocean breeze, which are regulated by the thermal contrasts between the ocean and mountains, and diurnal cycle of boundary layer friction. A comprehensive analysis of an afternoon LLJ and nocturnal LLJ indicates that there are large differences in wind field, vertical motions, and water vapor distributions between them. The local thermodynamic circulations also strongly affect vertical motions; even under a relatively stable atmosphere, the vertical motions during LLJs are stronger than the monthly average. Afternoon LLJ events, associated with the southeasterly land\u2013ocean breeze in summer, occur more frequently than in winter; in contrast, nocturnal LLJ events, occur in summer less frequently than in winter. The seasonal variation analysis shows that land\u2013ocean breezes have significant effects on the wind speed, wind direction and heights of the afternoon LLJs; local thermal contrast forcing is believed to be the main factor that affects the LLJs during the daytime especially in warm seasons.",

Four experiments were designed: a control experiment and three data assimilation experiments with different data sets injected: conventional data only, a combination of conventional and ATMS satellite data, and a combination of conventional and CrIS satellite data. The results showed that the monthly mean of precipitation is shifted northward in the simulations and showed an orographic bias described as an overestimation upwind of the mountains and an underestimation in the south of the rain belt. The rain shadow mainly influenced prediction of the quantity of precipitation, although the main rainfall pattern was well simulated. For the first 24\u202fh and last 24\u202fh of accumulated daily precipitation, the model generally overestimated the amount of precipitation, but it was underestimated in the heavy-rainfall periods of 3\u20135, 13\u201316, and 22\u201325\u00a0July. The observed water vapor conveyance from the southeastern Tibetan Plateau was larger than in the model simulations, which induced inaccuracies in the forecast of heavy rain on 3\u20135\u00a0July. The data assimilation experiments, particularly the ATMS assimilation, were closer to the observations for the heavy-rainfall process than the control. Overall, based on the experiments in July 2015, the satellite data assimilation improved to some extent the prediction of the precipitation pattern over the Tibetan Plateau, although the simulation of the rain belt without data assimilation shows the regional shifting.",

        "title": "Characterization and source apportionment of submicron aerosol with aerosol mass spectrometer during the PRIDE-PRD 2006 campaign",
        "abstract": "Size-resolved chemical compositions of non-refractory submicron aerosol were measured using an Aerodyne quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometer (Q-AMS) at the rural site Back Garden (BG), located \u223c50 km northwest of Guangzhou in July 2006. This paper characterized the submicron aerosol particles of regional air pollution in Pearl River Delta (PRD) in the southern China. Organics and sulfate dominated the submicron aerosol compositions, with average mass concentrations of 11.8 \u00b1 8.4 \u03bcmg-3 and 13.5 \u00b1 8.7 \u03bc-3, respectively. Unlike other air masses, the air masses originated from Southeast-South and passing through the PRD urban areas exhibited distinct bimodal size distribution characteristics for both organics and sulfate: the first mode peaked at vacuum aerodynamic diameters (D va) &sim;200 nm and the second mode occurred at Dva from 300-700 nm. With the information from AMS, it was found from this study that the first mode of organics in PRD regional air masses was contributed by both secondary organic aerosol formation and combustion-related emissions, which is different from most findings in other urban areas (first mode of organics primarily from combustion-related emissions). The analysis of AMS mass spectra data by positive matrix factorization (PMF) model identified three sources of submicron organic aerosol including hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA), low volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LV-OOA) and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SV-OOA). The strong correlation between HOA and EC indicated primary combustion emissions as the major source of HOA while a close correlation between SV-OOA and semi-volatile secondary species nitrate as well as between LV-OOA and nonvolatile secondary species sulfate suggested secondary aerosol formation as the major source of SV-OOA and LV-OOA at the BG site. However, LV-OOA was more aged than SV-OOA as its spectra was highly correlated with the reference spectra of fulvic acid, an indicator of aged and oxygenated aerosol. The origin of HOA and OOA (the sum of LV-OOA and SV-OOA) has been further confirmed by the statistics that primary organic carbon (POC) and secondary organic carbon (SOC), estimated by the EC tracer method, were closely correlated with HOA and OOA, respectively. The results of the EC tracer method and of the PMF model revealed that primary organic aerosol (POA) constituted \u223c34-47 % of OA mass and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) constituted \u223c53-66 % of regional organic aerosol in PRD during summer season. The presence of abundant SOA was consistent with water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) results (accounting for \u223c60 % of OC on average) by Miyazaki et al. (2009) for the same campaign. OOA correlated well with WSOC at the BG site, indicating that most OOA were water soluble. More specifically, approximately 86 % of LV-OOA and 61 % of SV-OOA were estimated as water soluble species on the basis of carbon content comparison. \u00a9 2011 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Although it has long been recognized that significant amounts of nitrogen, typically in the form of ammonia (NH(3)) applied as fertilizer, are lost to the atmosphere, accurate estimates are lacking for many locations. In this study, a detailed, bottom-up method for estimating NH(3) emissions from synthetic fertilizers in China was used. The total amount emitted in 2005 in China was estimated to be 3.55 Tg NH(3)-N, with an uncertainty of \u00b1 50%. This estimate was considerably lower than previously published values. Emissions from urea and ammonium bicarbonate accounted for 64.3% and 26.5%, respectively, of the 2005 total. The NH(3) emission inventory incorporated 2448 county-level data points, categorized on a monthly basis, and was developed with more accurate activity levels and emission factors than had been used in previous assessments. There was considerable variability in the emissions within a province. The NH(3) emissions generally peaked in the spring and summer, accounting for 30.1% and 48.8%, respectively, of total emissions in 2005. The peaks correlated with crop planting and fertilization schedules. The NH(3) regional distribution pattern showed strong correspondence with planting techniques and local arable land areas. The regions with the highest atmospheric losses are located in eastern China, especially the North China Plain and the Taihu region.",

        "abstract": "Concentrations of NO(x), SO2 and O3 were measured by passive sampling within 200km x 200km grid in Pearl River Delta (PRD). Sampling period was two weeks in November, 2009. Spatial distributions of NO(x), SO2 and O3 were obtained by Kriging interpolation method. The results were compared with emission inventories and modeling results. The transportations of O3 were evaluated by using backward trajectories of air parcels. During the sampling period, the mean concentrations of NO(x), SO2 and O3 were 75.9 microg/m3, 37.3 microg/m3 and 36.2 microg/m3, respectively. And the highest concentrations of NO(x), SO2 and O3 were 195.7 microg/m3, 95.9 microg/m3 and 81.8 microg/m3. Comparing with routine measurements from the regional monitoring network in PRD, the results by passive method were 18.6%, 33.5% and 37.5% lower for NO(x), SO2 and O3, respectively. The spatial patterns demonstrated that higher NO(x) concentrations often appeared in cities such as Guangzhou, Foshan and Shenzhen. SO2 concentrations were higher in west and lower in east. High SO2 concentrations are mainly from emission of power plants and industrial sources. Concentrations of O3 showed the highest levels in the south of PRD. Backward trajectory analysis for higher ozone areas indicated that 53% of the air masses were from the region with high concentration of NO(x). The horizontal transportation caused higher ozone in the south while lower in north in PRD.",

        "abstract": "Methacrolein (MACR) and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) are two major intermediate products from the photochemical oxidation of isoprene, the most important biogenic volatile organic compound. In addition, MACR and MVK have primary emissions. Investigating the sources and evolution of MACR and MVK could provide helpful information for the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. In this study, hourly measurements of isoprene, MACR, and MVK were conducted at a receptor site in the Pearl River Delta region (PRD), i.e., the Heshan site (HS), from 22 October to 20 November, 2014. The average mixing ratios of isoprene, MACR and MVK were 151\u202f\u00b1\u202f17, 91\u202f\u00b1\u202f6 and 79\u202f\u00b1\u202f6\u202fpptv, respectively. The daily variations and the ratios of MVK/MACR during daytime and nighttime suggested that other sources besides isoprene photooxidation influenced the MACR and MVK abundances at the HS. Positive matrix factorization was utilized to resolve the sources of MACR and MVK. Five sources were identified and quantified, including biogenic emissions, biomass burning, secondary formation, diesel, and gasoline vehicular emissions. Among them, secondary formation made the greatest contribution to observed MACR and MVK with average contributions of ~45% and ~70%, respectively. Through the yields of secondary products from the oxidation of MACR and MVK by the OH radical and the concentrations of MACR and MVK, it was found that methylglyoxal and formaldehyde were the main oxidation products of MACR and MVK at the HS site. Overall, this study evaluated the roles of primary emissions on ambient levels of MACR and MVK and advanced the understanding of photochemical oxidation of MACR and MVK in the PRD.",

        "abstract": "Acetone emission from pine plants (pinus sylvestris) is measured by continuously stirred tank reactor. Under a constant light intensity, acetone emission rates increase exponentially\n with leaf temperature. When leaf temperature is kept constant, acetone emission increases with light intensity. And acetone\n emission in darkness is also detected. Acetone emitted from pine is quickly labeled by 13C when the plants are exposed to air with 630 mg/m3\n 13CO2. However, no more than 20% of acetone is 13C labeled. Acetone emission from pine may be due to both leaf temperature-controlled process and light intensity-controlled\n process. Based on these understandings, an algorithm is used to describe the short term acetone emission rates from pine.",

The dry deposition\n loads of sulphur, calcium and nitrogen are estimated by using a canopy throughfall approach. The results indicate that the\n annual dry deposition loads of sulphur and calcium at Tieshanping site are much higher than those measured in forestry areas\n in other countries, while the dry deposition flux of nitrogen is at a comparable level.

The accelerometer contains four parts, compliant cylinder, FBG, inertial mass, shell. In this design, the FBG is placed along the axis of the compliant cylinder, the material of the compliant cylinder is two-component vulcanized silicone rubber. The principle of the FBG accelerometer was analyzed theoretically. The amplitude\u2013frequency responsivity, linear response and temperature characteristics of the sensor were studied by experiment. Experimental results show that the sensor has a broad flat frequency range from 30 to 300 Hz, and the sensitivity of the accelerometer is 42.7 pm/G with a linearity of 0.999. The applicable temperature range of the acceleration sensor at least more than 150.0 \u00b0C, and the dynamic range is 76 dB, making it as a good candidate for the downhole seismic signal measurement.",

        "abstract": "Optical fiber sensing technology is one of the very promising techniques in sensing fields. A high sensitivity high temperature sensor based on inline optical fiber Mach-Zehnder(M-Z) interferometer by using standard single mode fiber with two waist-enlarged bitapers is proposed in the present paper. The waist-enlarged bitapers are considered as couplers, the distance between the two bitapers is the sensing arm. The light in the lead-in fiber core couples into the sensing arms' fiber core and cladding by the first bitaper, and then propagate in them. The phase difference between core mode and cladding mode is produced when the light reaches the second bitaper. Then the second bitaper couples the light into the lead-out single-mode fiber to get the interference spectrum. The sensors with different length were fabricated. The relationship between the sensor length and interference period, and the temperature response of the.sensor were studied by experiments. The results show that the 35 mm long sensor has a high sensitivity of 0.115 nm x degrees C(-1) in the range of 30-400 degrees C. The transmission spectrum of the sensor was also analyzed by the fast Fourier transform. It shows that only LP01 mode and LP08 mode propagate in the sensor. Thesensor has advantages of small size, high precision, and immunity to electromagnetic inteference. In addition, it is of easy fabrication, high signal-to-noise ratio, light weight, and high sensitivity, and could be operated under high temperature. This kind of sensor is a good candidate for high temperature measurement of hot gas, oil and gas well logging and other areas.",

The experiment shows that the eight packaged FBG sensors have good linearity which is above 0.999 and the waveform hasn't any chirp. The average temperature sensitivity coefficient of the packaged FBG is 2.05\u00d710-5/\u00b0C which is close to the theoretical value, and the average deviation is 0.04\u00d710-5/\u00b0C.

        "abstract": "Abstract   A dual-parameter fiber-optic sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) cascaded with Fabry\u2013Perot interferometer (FPI) structure is described and demonstrated to measure temperature and gas pressure simultaneously. The proposed sensing structure consists of an extrinsic FPI in the form of hemispherical ultraviolet (UV) curing glue capped on a FBG end face. The spectral interference peak produced by the UV glue FPI is sensitive to ambient temperature and gas pressure variations, whereas the reflection spectrum of FBG only depends on temperature and insensitive to pressure change, therefore, the temperature and gas pressure can be simultaneously measured by this cascaded sensor. Experimental results show that the sensor has higher temperature and gas pressure sensitivities of 223.4 pm/   \u00b0    C and 24.99 nm/MPa in a range from 30        \u2218     C to 110        \u2218     C and from 0.1 MPa to 0.7 MPa. Utilizing the temperature-dependent sensitivity of FBG, a constructed sensitivity matrix is used to distinguish measurement of temperature and gas pressure, and the measurement resolutions are determined to be 0.086        \u2218     C and 0.730 KPa. This sensing architecture is not only an effective method for single-point multi-parameter measurement, but also has merits of high sensitivity, compactness, ease of fabrication and low cost, which make it valuable for biosensors and medical applications.",

        "abstract": "A fiber humidity sensor based on Fiber-Bragg Grating (FBG) sandwiched in single-mode-multimode fiber core-single mode (SMS) fiber structure is proposed and demonstrated. When the surrounding humidity changes, the central wavelength of FBG remains unchanged for it is insensitive to humidity, while the interference spectrum of SMS fiber structure will shift for it is sensitive to the surrounding humidity. Hence, the shift of the SMS fiber structure interference spectrum with humidity could modulate the FBG core mode. Through measuring the reflected power of the FBG core mode the detection of humidity can be realized. The beam propagation of the SMS fiber structure with different lengths of multimode fiber core (MMFC), diameters of MMFC, and surrounding refractive indices are theoretically simulated with beam propagation method. Theoretical simulation indicates that the output core mode power coefficients shift with surrounding humidity of the SMS fiber structure. Experimental results show that the sensor has a linear response to humidity with enhanced sensitivity of 0.06 dBm\u00b7(%RH)-1 in the humidity range of 45%~95%RH with length of 35 mm and diameter of 85 \u03bcm. The temperature effect of the sensor is also discussed, the temperature sensitivity is 0.008 nm\u00b7\u2103-1 in the temperature range of 20~80 \u2103 and the measurement error of temperature is 0.047% RH\u00b7\u2103-1. Such cost-effective, high sensitive, and reflective power detection based optical fiber humidity sensor could be used in humidity sensing applications.",

        "abstract": "In order to understand the aging and processing of organic aerosols (OA), an intensive field campaign (<b>C</b>ampaign of <b>A</ b>ir <b>P</b>ollution at <b>T</b>ypical <b>C</b>oastal <b>A</b>reas <b>IN</b> Eastern China, CAPTAIN) was conducted March-April at a receptor site (a Changdao island) in central eastern China. Multiple fast aerosol and gas measurement instruments were used during the campaign, including a high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) that was applied to measure mass concentrations and non-refractory chemical components of submicron particles (PM1nr). The average mass concentration of PM1(PM1nr+black carbon) was 47 \u00b1 36 \u03bcg m-3 during the campaign and showed distinct variation, depending on back trajectories and their overlap with source regions. Organic aerosol (OA) is the largest component of PM1 (30%), followed by nitrate (28%), sulfate (19%), ammonium (15%), black carbon (6%), and chloride (3%). Four OA components were resolved by positive matrix factorization (PMF) of the high-resolution spectra, including low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LV-OOA), semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and a coal combustion OA (CCOA). The mass spectrum of CCOA had high abundance of fragments from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (<i>m/z</i> 128, 152, 178, etc.). The average atomic ratio of oxygen to carbon in OA (O / C) at Changdao was 0.59, which is comparable to other field studies reported at locations downwind of large pollution sources, indicating the oxidized nature of most OA during the campaign. The evolution of OA elemental composition in the van Krevelen diagram (H / C vs. O / C) showed a slope of -0.63; however, the OA influenced by coal combustion exhibits a completely different evolution that appears dominated by physical mixing. The aging of organic aerosols vs. photochemical age was investigated. It was shown that OA / \u0394CO, as well as LV-OOA / \u0394CO and SV-OOA / \u0394CO, positively correlated with photochemical age. LV-OOA accounted for 73% of the OA secondary formation (SOA) in the oldest plumes (photochemical age of 25 h). The <i>k</i>OH at Changdao, by assuming SOA formation and aging as a first-order process proportional to OH, was calculated to be 5.2 &times; 10&minus;12 cm3 molec.-1 s-1, which is similar to those determined in recent studies of polluted air in other continents. \u00a9 Author(s) 2013.

        "abstract": "The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in South China is one of the most economically developed regions in China, but it is also noted for its severe air pollution due to industrial/metropolitan emissions. In order to continuously improve the understanding and quantification of air pollution in this region, an intensive campaign was executed in PRD during October-November 2008. Here, we report and analyze Aerodyne High-Resolution Aerosol Mass Spectrometer measurements at Kaiping, a rural site downwind of the highly-polluted central PRD area, to characterize the general features of submicron particulate pollution in the regional air. The mean measured PMsub>1 mass concentration was 33.1 plusmn;18.1 m-3 during the campaign and composed of organic matter (33.8%), sulfate (33.7%), ammonium (14.0%), nitrate (10.7%), black carbon (6.7%), and chloride (1.1%), which is characterized by high fractions of inorganic ions due to huge emissions of SO2 and NOx in PRD. The average size distributions of the species (except BC) were all dominated by an accumulation mode peaking at \u223c450 nm in vacuum aerodynamic diameter. Calculations based on high-resolution organic mass spectra indicate that C, H, O, and N on average contributed 56.6, 7.0, 35.1, and 1.3% to the total organic mass, respectively, corresponding to an organic matter mass to organic carbon mass ratio (OM/OC) of 1.77&plusmn;0.08. Based on the high-resolution organic mass spectral dataset observed, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis differentiated the organic aerosol into three components, i.e., biomass burning (BBOA) and two oxygenated (LV-OOA and SV-OOA) organic aerosols, which on average accounted for 24.5, 39.6 and 35.8% of the total organic mass, respectively. The BBOA showed strong features of biomass burning emissions and has been mainly attributed to the open field burning of crop residues after the harvest in PRD rural areas. The LV-OOA and SV-OOA were found to correspond to more aged (and thus less-volatile) and fresher (and semi-volatile) secondary organic aerosol (SOA), respectively. Analysis of meteorological influence supported that regional transport from the central PRD area was the major origin of the PM1 observed at the Kaiping site. \u00a9 2011 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "The mechanism of \u03b2-sheet crystallization in silk fibroin remains unclear, due to the incomplete information of protein assembly and structural state. The emerging terahertz (THz) spectroscopy (<10\u2009THz) has been taken as an important tool to detect new aspects of biomolecular structure and is used for the first time to analyze the methanol-water (MeOH) induced structural changes of Bombyx mori silk fibroin. Mid-infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that silk fibroin initially exists in a typical silk I form and reassemble into a predominant silk II (antiparallel \u03b2-sheet crystal) structure after MeOH treatment. The samples treated with MeOH-HO mixed solutions show a predominant silk I structure without any silk-II-related peaks. As the MeOH concentration approaches 40\u2009vol%, the absorbance of the \u03b2-sheet-related IR bands and the XRD peaks gradually increase, indicating a formation of \u03b2-sheet crystal during this process.\u2009THz spectrum shows the absorption capacity below 3\u2009THz as well as the absorbance at 5.1\u2009THz and 7.9\u2009THz is indeed affected by the MeOH-HO treatment, implying a MeOH-HO-dependent change of intermolecular H-bonds in silk fibroin. The THz spectrum for silk fibroin gives additional information to the existing studies on the MeOH-HO induced \u03b2-sheet crystallization of silk fibroin, which may help us understanding the structural changes of natural silk.",

        "abstract": "Here we investigated the structural changes of silk fibroin during Bombyx mori silkworm spinning and reconstitution process. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, polarized optical microscopy, and terahertz (THz) spectroscopy were applied to monitor the structural features of silk fibroin from posterior, middle silk glands, to cocoons, and then to reconstituted silk. Results show that from silk gland to cocoon, fibroin experiences a significant transformation in crystal structure from a typical silk I, to a silk I-rich mixed structure, and finally to a typical silk II state, accompanied with a change in secondary structure from \u03b1-helix and random coil structures to preferential orientation \u03b2-sheets. Compared with natural silk fibroins, the reconstituted silk fibroin lacks \u03b2-sheet conformation and orientation crystallization. Terahertz spectroscopy readily follows these silk fibroin structural changes. Two characteristic peaks for silk fibroin is observed in 2-10 THz. Their strength ratio is strongly correlated with the \u03b2-sheet conformation. The absorbance properties in 0.2-2.0THz also significantly change as a function of changing their crystal structures caused by diverse sources. All of these observations will help in the study of overall structure in silk fibroin to understand more completely the fibroin assembly process in natural spinning and reconstitution process.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the risk factors of exacerbation of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) in early stage, in order to formulate therapeutic strategies including minimally invasive intervention and organ support, and to finalize an individualized and comprehensive therapy for the SAP in early stage to decrease the mortality.Fifty-three patients with SAP admitted from 1995 to 1999 was categorized as group 1, and 57 patients admitted from 2000 to 2005 as group 2, were analyzed retrospectively. Ranson's score, acute physiological and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, Balthazar CT grade, presence or absence of biliary tract obstruction, hypoxia, lung infection, shock, abdomen compartment syndrome (ACS), hyperlipemia, pleural effusion were analysed logistically. Mortality following different treatments and incidence rate of complications were also evaluated.In the two groups, 13 patients of the group 1 and 14 of group 2 were complicated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in the early stage. There was difference in Ranson's score, APACHE II, Balthazar CT grade, between the groups with and without MODS (all P<0.05). Higher incidences of shock, biliary tract obstruction, ACS, hyperlipemia, pleural effusion were seen in group with MODS (P<0.01). Mortality of group 2 patients was lowered after receiving a comprehensive therapy including bedside hemodialysis (CBP) and artificial liver support (P<0.01).Development of MODS in SAP and its mortality are related to strategies of treatment, and adoption of an individualized and comprehensive therapy for the SAP in early stage can decrease the complications and the mortality.",

Methods We recruited 36 patients with MODS treated in ICU during the period of April 2008 to Sept. 2009. Patients were randomly asigned into continuous normal-volume hemofiltration group (group A,n=16) or daytime high-volume hemofiltration group (group B,n=36). Mortality rate,critical care score,the days staying in ICU,and the days without organ failure within 28 days were compared between the 2 groups. Result There were no difference in mortality rate within 28 days between the 2 groups (25.0% in group A,and 31.25% in group B; \u03c72=0.173,P=0.667). In group A,however,the days without organ failure were longer (18\u00b18 days in group A,and 11\u00b18 days in group B; t=2.21,P=0.036),and the days staying in ICU were shorter (8\u00b15 days in group A and 11\u00b15 days in group B; t=2.30,P=0.029). Conclu-sion Daytime continuous high-volume hemofiltration is a safe and efficient method for the treatment of MODS in ICU.",

Methods 56 patients with septic shock admitted to our ICU from 2004-12 to 2007-12 were studied. Patients with septic shock who had renal failure or required the dialysis prior to hospitalization were excluded. After successful fluid resuscitation by early goal-directed therapy, patients were randomly divided into two groups (limited fluid input and unlimited fluid input) to compare some data including mortality, the days of weaning respirator, the days in ICU and the days without organ failure within 28 days. Result There were no differences in the mortality and the days without organs failure between two groups (P>0.05), but there were obvious differences in the days of weaning respirator and the days in ICU(P<0.05).

Methods: One hundred and seven SAP patients served as A group, who admitted from Janurary 1995 to December 1999. One hundred and thirty patients served as B group who admilted from Janurary 2000 to 2005. Age, sex, Ranson' score, APACHE II, CT score, biliary tract obstruction, hypoxia, lung infection, shock, abdomen compartment syndrome, hyperlipemia, pleural effusion, and mortality were analyzed. Results: Twenty-five in the A group and 28 in B group two were complicated with MODS at the early stage. There existed difference in Ranson's score, APACHE II, CT score between patients with and without MODS (P < 0.05). Shock, biliary tract obstruction, abdomen compartment syndrome, hyperlipemia, pleural effusion were more severe in patients with MODS (P < 0.01). Mortality in B group was decreased because of receiving such therapy as bedside CBP, artificial liver support. Conclusion: Biliary tract obstruction, hypoxia, lung infection, shock, abdomen compartment syndrome, hyperlipemia, pleural effusion and clinical treatments are connected with SAP complicated with MODS at the early stage. The incidence rate of MODS can be reduced by effective treatment.",

        "abstract": "To study the level and significance of T helper 17 (Th17) and CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) in peripheral blood of patients with sepsis and to evaluate the effects of Xuebijing injection on them.\u00b9 Sixty-four patients with sepsis in intensive care unit (ICU) of Anhui Provincial Hospital were divided into three groups: sepsis group (n=26), severe sepsis group (n=21), and septic shock group (n=17). Eighteen healthy individuals served as controls. The comparison in the expression of Th17 and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg within groups and the correlation between their levels and the severity of sepsis was made. \u00b2 Sixty-four patients were also randomly divided into two groups: routine group (n=25, received routine bundle treatment) and Xuebijing treatment group (n=39, received bundle treatment + Xuebijing treatment). Patients in Xuebijing treated group were given 50 ml Xuebijing injection two times per day in addition to routine bundle treatment. Seven days constituted one course of treatment. The expressions of Th17 and CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg of 64 patients on the 1 day and 7 days after treatment were detected by flow cytometry. The effects of Xuebijing injection on the patients were evaluated.\u00b9 The expression rate of Th17 and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg was (0.84 \u00b1 0.29)% and (0.43 \u00b1 0.20)% respectively in control group, and they were lower than that of patients with sepsis (P<0.05). The expression rate of Th17 was higher in severe sepsis group [(3.18 \u00b1 0.84)%] than that of other two groups (P <0.05). Moreover , The expression rate of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg was highest [(3.28 \u00b1 0.76)%] in septic shock group (P<0.05) , and it was positive correlated with acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII) score and blood lactate (r(1)=0.519, r(2)=0.451, both P =0.01) in all 64 patients. \u00b2 Compared with routine group, our study indicated that Xuebijing injection could reduce the abnormal expression of Th17 [(1.72 \u00b1 0.69)% vs. (2.35 \u00b1 0.81)%,P<0.05] and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg [(1.78 \u00b1 1.00)% vs. (2.30 \u00b1 0.85)%,P<0.05] and decrease length of stay in ICU [(4.7 \u00b1 2.6) days vs. (7.5 \u00b1 4.3) days,P=0.002]. It also lowered 28-day mortality of patients with sepsis, but the difference between two groups was not significant (20.5% vs. 28.0%,P>0.05).The expression of Th17 and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg was increased in sepsis patients and was positively correlated with severity of sepsis, suggesting that they may play an important role in pathogenesis of sepsis. Xuebijing injection could decrease the abnormal expression of Th17 and CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg and tend to decrease the fatality rate of sepsis.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the possible mechanism of natural killer cells (NK cells) in immune dysfunction in sepsis by monitoring the phenotype and function of periphery NK cells in patients with sepsis.A retrospective study was conducted. The patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS, n=59) or sepsis (n=65) admitted to Department of Critical Care Medicine of Anhui Provincial Hospital from August 2011 to August 2013 were enrolled. Blood samples were collected within 48 hours after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, the phenotype and function of periphery NK cells were determined by flow cytometry. Twenty-eight healthy people served as controls.The proportion and number of peripheral blood CD3\u207b CD56\u207a NK cells in SIRS and sepsis groups were normal, and no statistical difference was found when compared with those of the healthy control group [cell proportion: 0.102 \u00b1 0.019, 0.102 \u00b1 0.108 vs. 0.106 \u00b1 0.018, F = 0.018, P = 0.982; cell number (\u00d7 10\u2076/L): 182.46 \u00b1 65.98, 172.97 \u00b1 63.51 vs. 179.25 \u00b1 60.44, F=0.349, P=0.706]. It was shown by NK cell degranulation detection that there was no significant difference in the expression of CD107 and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) secretion [CD107: 0.135 \u00b1 0.050, 0.140 \u00b1 0.058, 0.128 \u00b1 0.070, F = 0.583, P = 0.560; IFN-\u03b3 (kU/L): 14.36 \u00b1 4.74, 12.49 \u00b1 4.21, 13.45 \u00b1 5.04, F=1.616, P=0.202] among healthy control group, SIRS group, and sepsis group. It was shown by antibody dependent cytotoxic effect (ADCC) test that there was no difference in the expression of CD107 among healthy control group, SIRS group, and sepsis group (0.574 \u00b1 0.166, 0.643 \u00b1 0.165, 0.581 \u00b1 0.157, F = 0.808, P = 0.448). When compared with healthy controls, the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 was increased in SIRS patients (kU/L: 40.5 \u00b1 13.2 vs. 28.4 \u00b1 9.6, P = 0.001), while reduced in sepsis patients (kU/L: 19.8 \u00b1 6.7 vs. 28.4 \u00b1 9.6, P<0.01). Compared with SIRS group, only NK cell surface inhibitory receptors CD158e (KIR 3DL1) expression in sepsis group was significantly increased (0.203 \u00b1 0.057 vs. 0.079 \u00b1 0.021, t = 15.762, P<0.001), and there were no significant differences in the other phenotype between the two groups. Compared with SIRS group, the IFN-\u03b3 production of the sepsis group was significantly lowered (kU/L: 0.280 \u00b1 0.040 vs. 0.310 \u00b1 0.038, t = 3.390, P = 0.009), and the level of IL-12 was also significantly decreased (ng/L: 0.15 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 0.30 \u00b1 0.08, t = 32.832, P < 0.001).It was showed by NK cell phenotype and function assay that the function of NK cells in patients with sepsis was impaired and led to a poor production of IFN-\u03b3. The IFN-\u03b3 mediated immune dysfunction may be a main reason for the disorder of NK cell function, which laid the foundation of the clinical immune intervention practice to improve to NK cell function.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the influence of different hemoperfusion ( HP ) intensity on 7-day and 28-day mortality for patients with paraquat ( PQ ) poisoning, and examine the factors that may affect the decision of the clinicians to prescribe a high intensity HP.A retrospective cohort study was conducted. The patients admitted to the department of critical care medicine of Anhui Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Anhui Medical University with the diagnosis of PQ poisoning from August 2012 to August 2014, fulfilling the following criteria were enrolled in the study: older than 18 years, interval from ingestion PQ to hospital admission shorter than 12 hours, and receiving HP treatment within 24 hours, and expecting surviving time exceeding 24 hours after admission, and data of the patients available for at least 28 days after admission. Depending on the intensity of HP, patients were assigned to either lower intensity HP group ( LHP, defined as receiving HP for less than 4 hours, 2 columns ) or higher intensity HP group ( HHP, defined as receiving HP longer than 6 hours, 3 columns ). Patients' data were retrieved from hospital's electronic database after hospital admission, and the results at 7th day and 28th day were recorded. Multiple logistic regression model was used to determine factors with which the clinician decided to choose the intensity of HP for the patients, and Cox regression model was used to evaluate 7-day and 28-day mortality.Data of 60 patients was finally available for this study. LHP group consisted of 28 patients, with a 7-day mortality of 53.6% ( 15 patients ) and 28-day mortality of 64.3% ( 28 patients ); 32 patients were assigned to HHP group with 7-day mortality of 43.8% ( 14 patients ) and 28-day mortality of 62.5% ( 20 patients ). Twenty-eight patients constituted as the HHP group, with higher PQ concentration in plasma, higher incidence of respiratory alkalosis and acute kidney injury ( AKI ), and higher level of lactate ( Lac ) compared with LHP group. However, a lower 7-day mortality was observed in the HHP group. Multiple logistic regression model indicated that at admission, interval from ingestion PQ to hospital admission longer than 4 hours [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.461, 95% confidence interval ( 95%CI ) = 1.132-1.435, P < 0.001 ], younger than 50 years old ( 40-49 years old: OR = 1.397, 95%CI = 1.251-1.703, P = 0.002; < 40 years old: OR = 1.701, 95%CI = 1.253-1.836, P < 0.001 ), PQ plasma concentration \u2265 2 mg/L ( OR = 3.140, 95%CI = 1.511-3.091, P < 0.001 ), white blood cell ( WBC ) > 10\u00d710(9)/L ( OR = 1.222, 95%CI = 1.032-1.275, P = 0.018 ), Lac > 2.0 mmol/L ( OR = 2.392, 95%CI = 2.090-2.734, P < 0.001 ), AKI on admission ( stage 2: OR = 2.350, 95%CI = 2.160-3.910, P < 0.001; stage 3: OR = 2.821, 95%CI = 1.932-3.651, P < 0.001 ), accompanying hypoxia ( OR = 2.420, 95%CI = 2.131-2.662, P = 0.003 ) were more likely to receive higher intensity of HP. Furthermore when compared with patients survived for 28 days, patients who were older, with higher levels of PQ concentration at admission or after 4 hours of HP, accompanied by AKI, increased serum creatinine ( SCr ), WBC, Lac, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II ( APACHEII) score, lower arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( PaCO2 ) and lower pH value were more likely to die. After adjusted for con-variables in COX regression model, HHP was associated with lower 7-day mortality after admission [ hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.843, 95%CI = 0.732-0.971, P = 0.032 ], but devoid of lowering effect on 28-day mortality rate ( HR = 0.930, 95%CI = 0.632-1.411, P = 0.423 ). In addition, age > 50 years old ( HR = 1.282, 95%CI = 1.050-1.530, P = 0.043 ), PQ concentration increased by 1 mg/L ( HR = 2.521, 95%CI = 2.371-3.825, P = 0.012 ), AKI on admission ( HR = 3.850, 95%CI = 2.071-5.391, P < 0.001 ), WBC>10\u00d7109/L ( HR = 1.932, 95%CI = 1.782-2.171, P = 0.006 ), Lac > 2.0 mmol/L ( HR = 2.981, 95%CI = 2.210-3.792, P = 0.002 ), and PaCO2 < 35 mmHg ( HR = 1.772, 95%CI = 1.483-2.516, P = 0.008; 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa ) were independent risk factors for 28-day mortality.Though HHP was helpful in lowering mortality rate in patients with PQ poisoning within 7 days, it did not influence on 28-day mortality. Clinicians' decisions on HP intensity need further investigation, and more perfect clinical evaluation system is required for reasonable use of expensive medical resources such as HP.",

        "abstract": "This paper seeks to identify the causal effect of export on wage inequality.We firstly decompose the changes of the wage inequality in China's industrial sector during the period of 2002-2007,and then introduce the impact of export into the decomposition framework.The main finding is that changes in wage inequality in industrial sector are mainly caused by technological progress within sectors.Increase in the export intensity would cause a relatively more skill-biased technological progress,and then an upward change in the wage inequality.We establish an econometric model and estimate it to test the main decomposition findings with industrial level data.Our estimation results suggest that export intensity is significantly positively related with wage inequality,which is not the result of reverse causality.During the sample period,changes in export intensity account for 17.32%~22.51% of the changes in wage inequality in industrial sector.On the whole,the skill-bias of technological change can actually explain 51.13% of the change in wage inequality.Based on the empirical analysis,this paper suggests that government should focus on improving the technical level of export,and should also create conditions for strengthening the \"learning by doing\" effect of export behavior.",

Through calculating the anti-dumping index of the five product cate gories in India, it discovers that the index is positively related with the competition between the export products and the domestic industry in India. Finally, it analyzes the trade diversion effects of India-to-China antidumping based on the former product classification. It concludes that the sizes of the trade diversion effects are different among different products, and there are smaller effects on the export of our products which have more comparative advantages.",

We focus our study on the new exporters. We first adopt a matching method to select the non-exporters and construct our comparison group for the 456 newly export firms. Then a Difference-in Difference (DID) is employed to investigate the causal effect of firms\u2019 export decision on their employees\u2019 earnings. This paper finds that after controlling for firm size, firm age, ownership and geographic location etc., there is no significant improvement in the firm\u2019s employee wages after it started to export. Such conclusion remains the same for various robustness tests, like using different matching criteria and various matching methods, considering firms\u2019 ownership, export intensity, delayed wage response as well as using a longer period sample (2000\u20142006). Based on these findings, we conclude that despite the fact that exports play an ever increasing role in China\u2019s total economic growth, there is no strong evidence that supports the positive role of export in improving employees\u2019 earnings.",

        "abstract": "The article asserts that foreign investment may affect the skill premiums via two kinds of approaches.On the one hand,foreign investment may act on the relative demand of skilled labor by technology spillovers and further on the skill premiums.On the other hand,foreign investment could influence the skill premiums through its effect on the relative supply of skilled labor.Then we test the two channels empirically by a simultaneous estimation.Our main estimations show that foreign investment may generalize a significant negative effect on the relative demand of skilled labor through a technology spillover biased towards unskilled labor.Furthermore,we fail to detect any discernable effect of foreign investment on the relative supply of skilled labor,which may due to the exit of reverse flow concerning skilled labor.To sum up,China\u2032s FDI technology spillovers tend to be more unskilled-bias,and thus reduce the skill premiums in China.The foreign investment in China is averagely in high-end industry but low-end chain.",

Expressing hrf1 in rice enhanced the resistance to ZC3,ZD1 and ZG1 races of M. grisea,and only a few lesions developed on leaves of transgenic plants infested with ZB13 races,showing that the expression of hrf1 confers nonspecific resistance in rice to M. grisea. Transgenic plants and their T1,T3,T5 and T7 progenies were highly resistant to major M. grisea groups in rice-growing areas. The expression of several key plant defense genes (OsPR1a,OsPR1b,PAL,and Chia4a) and signal transduction gene NPR1 (non-expressor of PR genes) were enhanced in transgenic lines which were resistant to rice blast. Silicon content,which often correlates with resistance to M. grisea,was increased in transgenic lines. The results indicated that expressing harpin-encoding gene in rice exhibited stable nonspecific resistance,suggesting that the expression of harpin-encoding genes may provide effective controls on rice blast and offer new hope for generating broad spectrum resistance in other crops.",

In this work, we overexpressed and purified Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae harpin, harpin(Xoo), in Escherichia coli BL21/pGEX-hpa1. Harpin(Xoo) was fused to the C-terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and purified using the Bulk GST purification module and thrombin cleavage capture kit. Purified harpin(Xoo) protein was sensitive to protease K and stable to heat treatment, and could not induce a hypersensitive response after treatment with various plant metabolic inhibitors; these characteristics were similar to harpin(Ea) of Erwinia amylovora. The purified harpin(Xoo) showed a similar ability to induce tobacco mosaic virus resistance in tobacco as harpin(Ea). Its antibody worked well in detecting the purified harpin(Xoo), harpin(Xoo) in the total protein of E. coli BL21/pGEX-hpa1 and an hpa1 transgenic rice.",

        "abstract": "Three hrfA (hypersensitive response-functioning faction A) homologues (hrfl, hrf2 and hrf3) are cloned from 12 strains of Xanthomonas oryzae using PCR based techniques. Hrf1, hrf2 and hrf3 are derived from strains belonging to X. o. pv. oryzae, X. o. pv. oryzicola and X. o. pv. oryzae respectively. Sequence analysis shows that all three genes encode glycine-rich proteins with various numbers of GGG-GG motifs. They all share a conserved cysteine residue at position 45 or 47. Hrf1 and hrf3 encode Harpin(xoo) while hrf2 encodes Harpin(xooc) Hrf1 and hrf3 encodes two different types of Harpin(xoo) proteins. Hrf1 from X. o. pv. oryzae strains (JxoIII, JxoIV, Jxov, Pxo61, Pxo76, Pxo79, Pxo99, Pxo99 and Pxo124) encodes a 15.6 kD Harpin(xoo) with 3 GGG-GG motifs while Hrf3 from strain Pxo86 and Pxo112 encodes a 15.9 kD Harpin(xoo) with 4 GGG-GG motifs. Harpin(xooc) encoded by hrf2 from X. o. pv. oryzicola (strain RS105) has the molecular weight of 15.3 kD and contains 2 GGG-GG motifs. Cluster analysis is performed using deduced sequences of hrf1, hrf2 and hrf3 as well as previously reported Hpa1 and Xopl protein sequence. The results indicated that Harpin(xoo) and Harpin(xooc) belong to two closely related subgroups. Hrf, hrf2 and hrf3 are expressed in E. coli strain BL21 successfully. Under the same condition, hrf1, hrf2 and hrf3 are expressed at the level of 0.389, 0.530 and 0.083 mg/mL respectively. All expressed hrf1, hrf2 and hrf3 proteins (Harpins) are shown to be able to induce hypersensitive reaction and TMV resistance on tobacco. Among the three proteins, Hrf2 has the highest activity while Hrf3 has the lowest activity.",

The homologies of hpfr1 compared with hrf1 are 92% and inferred homologies of amino acid from hpfr1 compared with that from hrf1 are 74.8%. Hpfr1 gene was ligated into expression vector pET30a(+) which has T7 promoter to construct recombinant plasmid pHOSJ4. The function of this protein is similar to harpinXoo and causes HR in non-host plant. The seguences of hpfr1 and hrf1 are the same from the initiation code ATG to 225 bp site. The sequences from ATG to 225 bp site were cloned and constructed expression vector pHOSJ4-225. The crude recombinant proteins also cause HR in Xanthi tobacco. Sprays of the proteins onto Xanthi tobacco induce the resistance of tobacco to TMV remarkably. The contrast analyses of LSD indicate that the protein extraction of BL21 (DE3)/pHOSJ4 and BL21(DE3)/pHOSJ4-225 can dramatically enhance tobacco resistance to TMV.",

The pPIC9K-hscIL-12 was linearized with SacI and then transformed into the Pichia pastoris GS115 by PEG1000. Recombinant strains were screened by G418 resistant, and further confirmed by colony PCR. The hscIL-12 was induced to express in yeast by methano1. Western blot analysis showed that the relative molecular weight of the expressed product was about 70kDa, the expression protein could bind to IL-12 monoclonal antibody specifically. Quantitative analysis showed that the target protein was in a level of 26% of the total protein of the culture supernatant,with a yield of 40mg/L. Bioactivity assay showed that the recombinant hscIL-12 could stimulate the lymphocyte proliferation. The successful expression of the rhscIL-12 in Pichia pastoris can be potentially used in cancer gene therapy.",

        "abstract": "Objective To observe the 2 years therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese medicine GuKang Oral Liquid (GOL) in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (POP). Methods Using dual energy X-ray densitometer,based on the criteria of osteoporosis,98 cases of POP were included. All cases were with normal function of liver and kidney and without diseases of rheumatism and kidney,hyperparathyroidism,hyperthyroidism,gastric cancer and gastritis. The subjects were divided randomly into two groups:GOL group(50 cases) and control group(48 cases). GOL group was treated with GOL 10ml three times daily,control group were treated with alendronate sodium 10mg once daily. Before and after the treatment,the serum levels of E2,IL-6,BGP and ALP were determined,the U-Hop/Cr and U-Ca/Cr and BMD were measured too.Results In GOL treatment group,BMD increased and showed significant difference before and after treatment; In control group there is also BMD increase but with no significant difference; In both groups,there were no significant difference in serum E2 level before and after treatment; but the GOL group showed increase trends; there were no significant difference in serum IL-6 level before and after treatment in both groups,but the level of serum IL-6 in GOL group showed decrease and there was significant difference; In both groups,the serum ALP and BGP level show slim decrease with no significant difference; U-Hop/Cr and U-Ca/Cr level in both groups after treatment showed obvious decrease,with no significant difference between them; From the statistics difference before and after treatment,GOL group showed markedly better effect in the increase of BMD and serum E2 level and restricting IL-6 secretion than control group. Conclusion The results showed that GOL increased the BMD and the serum E2 level,and decreased the level of serum IL-6 and U-Hop/Cr and U-Ca/Cr. This result suggests that GOL has the effect of decreasing bone resorption. This may be related with its increase of E2 level. The increase of E2 may lead to the inhibition of the cells that secrete IL-6 and thus the decrease of IL-6 secretion,and inhibit the increased bone resorption caused by increase of IL-6 secretion.",

In order to develop a sensitively electrochemical biosensor of FKN, pSC 4 -AuNPs self-assembled multilayer film on the gold electrode surface was utilized to immobilize anti-FKN as a biorecognition surface. A novel porous  para -sulfonatocalix[4]arene-coated gold nanoparticles-functionalized metal-organic frameworks (pSC 4 -AuNPs/Cu-MOFs) was fabricated to recognize FKN by FKN aptamer and as signal tags for H 2 O 2  catalysis. pSC 4 -AuNPs multilayer displayed good biocompatibility and high electronic transmission. Combing with the good catalysis ability of Cu-MOFs, the quantitative FKN detection was achieved by the sensitive electrochemical immunosensor with the detection limit of 7.4\u2009pg/mL. With this design, the signal amplification strategy of the pSC 4 -AuNPs/Cu-MOFs composite offers a potential application of clinical detection of FKN.",

        "abstract": "Peptides, as the simplest biological recognition elements have been developed as probes to capture multitudinous targets. One important factor in fabricating peptide biochips is to immobilize peptides without losing their activity on a solid phase. To keep them functional, it is necessary to immobilize peptide in an oriented way. Calix[4]arene crown ether (CC) has been used as a protein linker molecule on the solid surface. In this study, calix[4]arene crown ether was self-assembled and modified on a gold surface. The calix[4]arene crown ether monolayer was characterized by EIS and SPR. An elaborately designed peptide probe Ac-CCPGCAAAARRRR-NH2 is employed here for the assay of Zn2+. This tridecapeptide consists of a binding part (CCPGC), spacer (AAAA) and immobilization part (RRRR) to interact with a CC SAM. We compared the sensitivity and the specificity of the linker molecules with those of common attachment agents using a zinc ion binding peptide. The fabricated chip showed a superior sensitivity and a much lower detection limit than those chips prepared by other methods. Thus, the calix[4]arene crown ether chip can be used as a powerful peptide linker with a wide range of applications, including peptide\u2013drug interaction, peptide\u2013cell interaction, and an enzyme activity assay.",

This scheme can greatly reduce sampling frequency, eliminate the effect of the parasitic amplitude modulation and overcome the carrier frequency drift. At the same time, a multi-quantum well laser is used as laser LED, which makes the carrier frequency have a wide range (0-20 MHz), and so enhances the frequency bandwidth and dynamical range of PGC demodulation. Experiment shows that it meets the demodulation requirement. Besides, because of its lower sampling frequency, this scheme can be well applied to the time division multiplexing optical sensor array.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the risk factor distributions in ischemic stroke patients of community hospitals and three-A hospitals. Methods The demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, and unhealthy life styles of 1 770 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke were investigated in the stroke clinics in Shanghai Renji Hospital (a three-A hospital of large scale) and 7 community health service centers in Shanghai Pudong and Putuo districts. The prevalence of each risk factor was calculated; the cumulative number and combination of risk factors were also assessed. Results The prevalences of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and stroke histories were significantly higher in the community hospital patients (all P<0.01) than those in Ruijin Hospital. The prevalences of hyperlipidemia, smoke, alcohol drinking and lack of exercise were significantly higher in patients from Ruijin Hospital compared with those from the community hospitals (all P<0.01); patients from the Ruijin Hospital were more liable to have multiple risk factors (P<0.001). However, the combination of hypertension with diabetes was more prevalent in community hospital patients (P<0.001). Conclusion For secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, the screening of risk factors should be strengthened. Community hospital patients should be strictly treated to control the vascular risk factors, while the patients from three-A hospitals should be given more education to improve their lifestyle.",

Methods A total of 2 201 successive patients with cerebrovascular diseases, who visited the stroke departments of Renji Hospital and 7 community health service centers in Pudong and Putuo districts in Shanghai, were included in the present study. The data of demographic characteristics,individual history and unhealthy life style were recorded. The percentages of each risk factor and the cumulative number of risk factors were analyzed. Results Among the 2 201 patients, 1 770(80.4%) had ischemic stroke and 431(19.6%) had hemorrhagic stroke; the mean age of onset was (67.2\u00b111.6) years old. The most common risk factors included hypertension (76.9%), dyslipidemia (55.0%), lack of exercise (47.7%), cigarette smoking (33.9%), stroke history (28.8%), heart disease (24.1%), diabetes (22.9%), alcohol drinking (22.7%), and family history of stroke (21.7%). We found that 90.8% of the patients had two or more risk factors, and each patient had a mean of 3.4 risk factors. Conclusion Most patients with cerebrovascular disease in Shanghai are elderly, and most of them have two or more risk factors. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lack of exercise are the most frequent risk factors. More attention should be paid to extensive screening of risk factors and change of life style for the secondary prevention of cerebrovascular disease.",

We evaluated population-based trends of AKI over the course of nine years, using a validated electronic health record tool to detect AKI. All adult residents (18 years of age and older) of Olmsted County, Minnesota (MN), admitted to the Mayo Clinic Hospital between 2006 and 2014 were included. The incidence rate of AKI was calculated and temporal trends in\u00a0the annual AKI incident rates assessed. During the nine-year study period, 10,283, and 41,847 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit or general ward, with 1,740 and 2,811 developing AKI, respectively. The unadjusted incidence rates were 186 and 287 per 100,000 person years in 2006 and reached 179 and 317 per 100,000 person years in 2014. Following adjustment for age and sex, there was no significant change in the annual AKI incidence rate during the study period with a Relative Risk of 0.99 per year (95% confidence interval 0.97-1.01) for intensive care unit patients and 0.993 per year (0.98-1.01) for the general ward patients. Similar results were obtained when the ICD-9 codes or administrative data for dialysis-requiring AKI was utilized to determine incident cases. Thus, despite the current literature that suggests an epidemic of AKI, we found that after adjusting for age and sex the incidence of AKI in the general population remained relatively stable over the last decade.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   MicroRNA-126(miR-126) targets involved in inflammation need to be identified. In this study, we aim to investigate whether high-mobility group box 1(HMGB1), an inflammation-related gene, is the target of miR-126 in diabetic vascular endothelium. The diabetic apoE \u2212/\u2212  mice model, a classical diabetic atherosclerosis model, was established. The aorta of diabetic apoE \u2212/\u2212  mice showed decrease of miR-126 and elevation of HMGB1 and inflammation. Next, we employed several in vitro experiments to address the role of miRNA-126 on the regulation of HMGB1 in endothelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory conditions. Manipulation of miRNA levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was achieved by transfecting cells with miR-126 mimic and antagomir. Overexpression of miR-126 could decrease the expression of downstream components of HMGB1 including TNF-\u03b1, ROS, and NADPH oxidase activity in HUVECs under hyperglycemic condition. Nevertheless, such phenomenon was completely reversed by miR-126 antagomir. The expression of HMGB1 protein rather than HMGB1 mRNA was down-regulated after transfection with miR-126 mimic, which indicated the modulation of HMGB1 mediated by miR-126 was at the posttranslational level. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed the 3\u2032-UTR of HMGB1 gene was a direct target of miR-126. Western blot analysis also indicated that overexpression of miR-126 contributed to the elevation of p-eNOS, eNOS and p-AKT expressions, respectively. In summary, our findings suggest that miR-126 may suppress inflammation and ROS production in endothelial cells treated by high glucose through modulating the expression of HMGB1. Our study provides a novel pathogenic link between dysregulated miRNA expression and inflammation in diabetic vascular endothelium.",

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a form of osteolytic disease caused by an imbalance in bone homeostasis, with reductions in osteoblast bone formation, and augmented osteoclast formation and resorption resulting in reduced bone mass. Cajaninstilbene acid (CSA) is a natural compound derived from pigeon pea leaves. CSA possesses beneficial properties as an anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antihepatitis, and anticancer agent; however, its potential to modulate bone homeostasis and osteoporosis has not been studied. We observed that CSA has the ability to suppress RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast marker gene expression, and bone resorption in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, it was revealed that CSA attenuates RANKL-activated NF-\u03baB and nuclear factor of activated T-cell pathways and inhibited phosphorylation of key signaling mediators c-Fos, V-ATPase-d2, and ERK. Moreover, in osteoclasts, CSA blocked RANKL-induced ROS activity as well as calcium oscillations. We further evaluated the therapeutic effect of CSA in a preclinical mouse model and showed that in vivo treatment of ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice with CSA protects the mice from osteoporotic bone loss. Thus, this study demonstrates that osteolytic bone diseases can potentially be treated by CSA.",

The optical components deliver laser energy and TRUS is used for photoacoustic signal detection. Compared to the previously reported probe, the new photoacoustic probe utilizes an optimized light illumination scheme to enhance the utilization-efficiency of the laser energy, thus improving the imaging sensitivity of the probe. In addition, the new probe is compact and easy to handle for clinicians. We validated the use of this photoacoustic probe for prostate cancer imaging through both phantom studies and  canine model study, which mimics the prostate cancer conditions. The results showed that the probe is suitable for clinical use and can be used in the clinics for several potential clinical applications, including early diagnosis of prostate cancer, targeted image-guided biopsy, and image-guided intra-operative procedure.",

        "abstract": "Mesoderm development is a finely tuned process initiated by the differentiation of pluripotent epiblast cells. Serine/threonine kinase 40 (STK40) controls the development of several mesoderm-derived cell types, its overexpression induces differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) towards the extraembryonic endoderm, and  knockout (KO) results in multiple organ failure and is lethal at the perinatal stage in mice. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological functions of STK40 in the mesoderm differentiation remain elusive. Here, we report that  ablation impairs mesoderm differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, STK40 interacts with both the E3 ubiquitin ligase mammalian constitutive photomorphogenesis protein 1 (COP1) and the transcriptional regulator proto-oncogene c-Jun (c-JUN), promoting c-JUN protein degradation. Consequently,  knockout leads to c-JUN protein accumulation, which, in turn, apparently suppresses the WNT signaling activity and impairs the mesoderm differentiation process. Overall, this study reveals that STK40, together with COP1, represents a previously unknown regulatory axis that modulates the c-JUN protein level within an appropriate range during mesoderm differentiation from mESCs. Our findings provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the c-JUN protein level and may have potential implications for managing cellular disorders arising from c-JUN dysfunction.",

Herein, mass spectrometric experiments and quantum-chemical calculations have identified that ScNH+ reacts quite efficiently with CO2 under thermal collision conditions to exclusively yields ScO+ and isocyanic acid (HNCO). This is a novel reaction type in CO2 activation reactions mediated by gas-phase ions. In this reaction, the C=N double bond has also been firstly formed in gas phase. The mechanism of \"migratory insertion\" is proposed. Coupled with the previously reported reaction of Sc+ with NH3, HNCO can be synthesized under mild conditions from NH3 and CO2 in quite simple reactions. The mechanistic information gained in this gas-phase model reaction can offer fundamental insights relevant to corresponding processes, and further guide how to design brand new catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Dinitrogen activation and reduction is one of the most challenging and important subjects in chemistry. Herein, we report the N2 binding and reduction at the well-defined Ta3N3H- and Ta3N3- gas-phase clusters by using mass spec-trometry (MS), anion photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), and quantum-chemical calculations. The PES and calculation results show clear evidence that N2 can be adsorbed and completely activated by Ta3N3H- and Ta3N3- clusters, yielding to the products Ta3N5H- and Ta3N5-, but the reactivity of Ta3N3H- is five times higher than that of the dehydrogenated Ta3N3- clusters. The Detailed mechanistic investigations further indicate that a dissociative mechanism dominates the N2 activation reactions mediated by Ta3N3H- and Ta3N3-; two and three Ta atoms are active sites and also electron do-nors for the N2 reduction, respectively. Although the hydrogen atom in Ta3N3H- is not directly involved in the reaction, its very presence modifies the charge distribution and the geometry of Ta3N3H-, which is crucial to increase the reactiv-ity. The mechanisms revealed in this gas-phase study stress the fundamental rules for N2 activation and important role of transition metals as active sites as well as the new significant role of metal hydride bonds in the process of N2 reduc-tion, which provides molecular-level insights into the rational design of tantalum nitride-based catalysts for N2 fixa-tion and activation or NH3 synthesis.",

The laser ablation generated ScNH+ cations have been mass-selected using a quadrupole mass filter and reacted with H2O in a linear ion trap reactor under thermal collision conditions. Through the mass spectrometry in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, we found that ammonia is released as the product in the reaction of ScNH+ with H2O, and this reaction is with high efficiency and selectivity, and the rate constant for the reaction is (1.14 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 10-10 cm3 molecule-1s-1, corresponding to the reaction efficiency of 15%. Metal imido complexes (*MNH) is one important intermediate in the current reported NH3 synthetic reactions. The gas-phase ScNH+ cation can be a simplified model of *MNH over catalysts of NH3 synthesis, and the obtained facile proton transfer mechanism obtained in this model system may offer fundamental mechanistic insights on how to design catalysts of ammonia production by using water as hydrogen source under ambient conditions.",

        "abstract": "The mass-selected copper oxide cluster cations Cu2O2+ are successfully prepared by laser ablation and reacted with benzene in a linear ion trap reactor. The cluster reaction is characterized by reflectron mass spectrometry in conjunction with density functional theory calculations. Four types of reaction channels are observed: (1) Cu2OH+ + C6H5O\u02d9, (2) Cu2C6H6+ + O2, (3) Cu(C6H6)2+ + Cu and (4) Cu2O2C6H6+, in which the first one is the major product. Observation of the products Cu2OH+ indicates that oxygen atom transfer (OAT) accompanying hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) occurs, and the oxygen-centered radical (O-\u02d9) in Cu2O2+ is crucial to the cleavages of C-H and Cu-O bonds. It is interesting that HAT and OAT occur in a single reaction channel to form C6H5O\u02d9, which has not been reported in the reactions of gas-phase ions with benzene. The calculated results are in agreement with the experimental observations, and no two-state reactivity scenario is present in the potential energy surface of channel 1. This work can provide useful insights into the nature of active sites over copper oxides and reaction mechanisms in the corresponding heterogeneous reactions.",

The congruent evaporation provides good film stoichiometry and the use of multiple targets facilitates heterojunction fabrication in a single vacuum chamber. Polycrystalline films were grown on alkali-free glass and on SnO2-coated glass from pressed powder targets in a vacuum of ~5\u00d710-6 torr. Optimum growth occurred near 280\u00b0C with growth rates of ~0.5 \u00c5/pulse. Devices were fabricated on the films after post-growth annealing and characterized by I-V and spectral quantum efficiency measurements",

        "abstract": "Abstract The utility and commercial potential of genetically engineered (GE) plants would benefit from the use of site-specific recombination systems that enable efficient excision of the marker genes used to identify transformants. Although wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world, GE varieties have yet to be put into commercial production. To develop the Bxb1 recombination system (derived from the Mycobacterium smegmati bacteriophage Bxb1) for site-specific marker gene removal in transgenic wheat, we used biolistics to introduce into the wheat genome a codon optimized Bxb1 recombinase gene (BxbNom) under the control of the maize ubiquitin-1 promoter (Ubi1). Recombinase activity was monitored using a GUSPlus reporter gene activation assay. BxbNom recombinase-mediated excision of an att site-flanked stuffer DNA fragment activated \u03b2-glucuronidase reporter activity in callus, endosperm, and leaves in transient assays. The system also detected activity in leaves and endosperm of progeny of multiple independent transgenic wheat lines stably expressing BxbNom. Our results demonstrate that the Bxb1 recombinase is heritable in transgenic wheat plants and performs site-specific excision, providing a useful tool for generating marker-free GE plants. Establishment of wheat lines capable of efficiently excising unneeded marker genes removes one potential barrier to commercial deployment of GE wheat.",

In this study, we demonstrate the use of the small serine recombination systems, ParA-MRS and CinH-RS2, to precisely excise a marker gene from the plastid genome of tobacco. Transplastomic plants transformed with the pTCH-MRS and pTCH-RS2 vectors, containing the visual reporter gene DsRed flanked by directly oriented MRS and RS2 recognition sites, respectively, were crossed with nuclear-genome transformed tobacco plants expressing plastid-targeted ParA and CinH recombinases, respectively. One hundred per cent of both types of F hybrids exhibited excision of the DsRed marker gene. PCR and Southern blot analyses of DNA from F plants showed that approximately 30% (CinH-RS2) or 40% (ParA-MRS) had lost the recombinase genes by segregation. The postexcision transformed plastid genomes were stable and the excision events heritable. The ParA-MRS and CinH-RS2 recombination systems will be useful tools for site-specific manipulation of the plastid genome and for generating marker-free plants, an essential step for reuse of SMG and for addressing concerns about the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in transgenic plants.",

        "abstract": "Genetic transformation is a powerful means for the improvement of crop plants, but requires labor- and resource-intensive methods. An efficient method for identifying single-copy transgene insertion events from a population of independent transgenic lines is desirable. Currently, transgene copy number is estimated by either Southern blot hybridization analyses or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments. Southern hybridization is a convincing and reliable method, but it also is expensive, time-consuming and often requires a large amount of genomic DNA and radioactively labeled probes. Alternatively, qPCR requires less DNA and is potentially simpler to perform, but its results can lack the accuracy and precision needed to confidently distinguish between one- and two-copy events in transgenic plants with large genomes. To address this need, we developed a droplet digital PCR-based method for transgene copy number measurement in an array of crops: rice, citrus, potato, maize, tomato and wheat. The method utilizes specific primers to amplify target transgenes, and endogenous reference genes in a single duplexed reaction containing thousands of droplets. Endpoint amplicon production in the droplets is detected and quantified using sequence-specific fluorescently labeled probes. The results demonstrate that this approach can generate confident copy number measurements in independent transgenic lines in these crop species. This method and the compendium of probes and primers will be a useful resource for the plant research community, enabling the simple and accurate determination of transgene copy number in these six important crop species.",
