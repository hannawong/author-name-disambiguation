First, the embedding region of watermark is selected via the human visual system model and local characteris- tics of image; then the round-off errors is analysed during the quantization step of JPEG compression; at the third phase, several simple formulas are assumed to embed several watermarks that are generated by bit-spreading and binary random sequences modulation. The watermark is detected without any reference to the original image. Experimental results show that the embedded watermark is invisible; while at the same time the algorithm is robust to some typical kinds of image processing such as scaling, salt & pepper noise, filtering, especially, JPEG compression and cropping attacks.",

Theoretical analysis and simulation result both show that the algorithm is remarkably superior to the Elhadef-Ayeb's diagnosis algorithm in terms of the number of iterations.The initial popula- tion production process proposed by Elhadef and Ayeb is also justified.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Systemic erythematosus lupus (SLE) is closely associated with activity of dendritic cells (DCs) function. DCs derive from hematopoietic precursor cells (HPCs) in vivo and many factors might affect the differentiation and maturation of DCs. The cytokine network was in disturbance and the levels of various cytokines were anomalous in SLE serum. Previous studies mainly addressed effects of single factors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of joint action of serum interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 in the serum of SLE patients on the differentiation and maturation of DCs derived from CD34+ HPCs. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The grouping, controlled and completely random designed study was performed at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Nanjing Medical University from May 2006 to October 2008. MATERIALS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 50 SLE patients from the Department of Rheumatology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University and 30 healthy volunteers from Nanjing Medical University. Cord blood samples were collected from 15 full-term normal delivery neonates from Nanjing Maternity and Children Health Care Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and their family members. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from SLE patients and healthy volunteers. According to serum IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 concentrations of normal person, 95% reference value range of serum IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 concentrations were calculated by the method of percentiles. Above this range represented abnormal increase. Cord blood mononuclear cells were harvested by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. CD34+HPCs were purified from cord blood by magnetic cell sorting system (MACS), and cultured to differentiate to DCs. There were 6 groups in this study. Normal serum, SLE serum with elevated levels of IFN-\u03b1, SLE serum with elevated levels of IL-6, SLE serum with elevated levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6, SLE serum with anti-IFN-\u03b1 and anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies, or normal serum with exogenous IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 were respectively added to the culture medium in each group. 10% volume fraction serum was used in each group, for totally 14 days incubation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The phenotype of DCs was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). Cytokine production was assessed by ELISA. The capacity of DCs to stimulate allogenic T lymphocyte proliferation and to regulate T cell differentiation was evaluated in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). RESULTS: Compared with normal serum, HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 expression was significantly increased in the medium containing SLE serum with elevated levels of IFN-\u03b1, SLE serum with elevated levels of IL-6, SLE serum with elevated levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 and normal serum with exogenous IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 (P < 0.05), whereas IL-12 levels were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and capacity of DCs to stimulate allogenic T lymphocyte proliferation was significantly enhanced (P < 0.05). Above-mentioned indexes recovered to a normal level in the medium containing SLE serum with anti-IFN-\u03b1 and anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies. Compared with normal serum, proportion of both CD3+CD8?IFN-\u03b3+ and CD3+CD8+IFN-\u03b3+ T cell subsets was significantly reduced in the medium containing SLE serum with elevated levels of IL-6 (P < 0.05). However, proportion of both CD3+CD8?IFN-\u03b3+ and CD3+CD8+IFN-\u03b3+ T cell subsets was significantly increased in the medium containing SLE serum with elevated levels of IFN-\u03b1, SLE serum with elevated levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6, normal serum with exogenous IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The joint action of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 in SLE serum promotes the differentiation and maturation of DCs derived from CD34+HPCs and affects the DC-mediated T cell differentiation, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE.",

Methods:CD34+HPCs were isolated and purified from cord blood by magnetic cell sorting system(MACS), and cultured with GM-CSF+IL-4+TNF-\u03b1. Normal serum or SLE serum with high level of IL-6 was added into culture medium respectively. The phenotypes of DCs(HLA-DR,CD80,CD86,CD83 and CD1a) were analyzed by FCM. Their abilities of stimulating allogenic T lymphocytes proliferation were examined by CCK-8, and ELISA was used to assess the IL-12, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 concentration in the culture supernatant. Results:The serum level of IL-6 was significantly higher in SLE patients than in controls. When cultured in SLE serum with high level of IL-6, CD34+HPCs could be induced to differentiate into DCs which produced little IL-10, little IFN-\u03b3 and lower IL-12, but expressed higher levels of HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86, and showed increased abilities of stimulating allogenic T lymphocytes proliferation compared with those cultured in normal serum. Conclusion: The high level of IL-6 in SLE serum has abnormal impacts on the differentiation and maturation of DCs and alters their characteristics, which may be involved in the initiation and maintenance of SLE.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the influential factors and provide improved method for inducing functional dendritic cells (DCs) derived from cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells (HPC) in vitro. Methods: CD34+HPC were isolated and purified from umbilical cord blood by using a high-gradient magnetic cell sorting system (MACS). CD34+ cells were cultured with different inducing medium which contained different cytokines: GM-CSF and TNF-\u03b1 (GT) or GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-4 (GTI) ,in order to differentiate into DCs. DCs derived from CD34+HPC were identified according to their morphology, phenotypes by FACS and laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. Their abilities of inducing proliferation of allogenic T cells were assessed by 3H-TdR incorporation assay. Results: The purity of selected CD34+ cells with MACS was more than 90%. DCs could be obtained from CD34+ HPC by the culture in presence of GM-CSF and TNF-\u03b1 or GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-4. DCs induced with GTI expressed higher level of surface antigen of CD80, CD86, CD83, CD1a and lower level of CD14 than those induced with GT. DCs showed typical morphology and property when they were induced with proper cytokines of GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1 added at 0 h and IL-4 added at 48 h. Conclusion:DCs could be generated from CD34+HPC by proper culture system. The culture system of GM-CSF + TNF-\u03b1 + IL-4 (GM-CSF and TNF-\u03b1 were added at 0 h, and IL-4 was added at 48 h) is preferred.",

        "abstract": "Background: Blood stem cells (BSCs) are the most primitive cells in the immune system and can be differentiated into many kinds of cells. As the regulatory cells of immune response, dendritic cells (DCs) have been attracted more and more attention in the field of autoimmune diseases. Due to different resources of precursor cells, DCs have different cytokines, ideal cytokine matching, applying orders, and experimental cultured conditions. Furthermore, development, phenotypic expression, and mature degree are still different. Objective: To investigate the influence of tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) on the culture system and provide improved method for inducing functional DCs in vitro, derived from cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells (HPC). Design, time and setting: Observational study, which was performed in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Nanjing Medical University from March 2005 to November 2005. Materials: The cord blood was collected from neonatal umbilical cord in the 81 Hospital of Nanjing City. CD34 monoclonal antibody coated magnetic bead system (MACS) was provided by Miltenyi Biotec Company, Germany; human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), human recombinant interleukin-4 (rhIL-4), and human recombinant tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 (rhTNF- \u03b1) by Pepro Tech Company, USA. Methods: CD34+HPC were isolated and purified from umbilical cord blood by using a high-gradient magnetic cell sorting system (MACS). Then the cells were cultured with different culture medium which contained different combinations of cytokines: GM-CSF and TNF- \u03b1 (GT) or GM-CSF, TNF- \u03b1 and IL-4 (GTI) in order to be induced to differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs). The DCs derived from CD34+HPC were identified for their morphology and phenotype by FACS and laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy, and also for their abilities of inducing proliferation of allogenic T cells by 3H-TdR incorporation assay. Results: The purity of selected CD34+ cells with MACS was more than 90%. DCs could be obtained from CD34+HPC by the culture in presence of GM-CSF and TNF- \u03b1 or GM-CSF, TNF- \u03b1 and IL-4. With the time of culture lasting, the cells expressed lower level surface antigen of CD34 and HLA-DR (P < 0.05), and possessed the phenotypes of DCs characterized by higher expression of CD80, CD86, CD83 and CD1a. At 13-15 days, the cells possessed higher level of phenotypes of DCs compared to 7-9 days and 10-12 days. DCs induced with GTI culture system expressed higher levels of surface antigen CD80, CD86, CD83, CD1a and a lower level of CD14 than those induced with GT culture system. DCs displayed typical morphology and property and expressed higher level surface antigen of CD86 and CD80, especially expressed CD86 when they were induced with proper cytokines of GM-CSF and TNF- \u03b1 added at 0 hour, and of IL-4 added at 48 hours. Conclusion: DCs can be generated from CD34+HPC by proper culture system, the design of GM-CSF + TNF- \u03b1 + IL-4 (GM-CSF and TNF- \u03b1 were added at 0 hour, IL-4 was added at 48 hours) is preferred.",

SLE serum was used to culture the PBMCs to show how the cytokine IL-10 in SLE serum influenced the production of IL-12. Results: The experiments showed that there were elevated IL-10 and IL-12 levels in the serum and cultured PBMCs supernatants of SLE patients. Furthermore, increased serum IL-10 had positive association with SLEDAI, and the correlation between IL-12 level in serum, cultured supernatants and disease activity were also found. When cultured with serum from SLE patients with high level of IL-10, PBMCs produced less IL-12 than control. If IL-10 neutralizing antibody was added into the culture system, decreased IL-12 could be restored.Conclusion: Increased IL-10 and IL-12 in serum of patients with SLE is positively correlated with SLEDAI. IL-10 could inhibit the production of IL-12 by PBMCs.",

        "abstract": "To study the apoptosis of lymphocyte subpopulations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and the possible role of IL-10 in this apoptosis involved in the pathogenesis of SLE, three color fluorescence and flow cytometry were used to investigate the early apoptosis of lymphocyte subsets from freshly separated or cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). ELISA was employed to detect the levels of IL-10 in serum and the levels of sFas and sFasL in cultured PBMC supernatants, and the results of sFas and sFasL were confirmed by real-time PCR of Fas and FasL mRNA. The results showed that in cells from SLE patients, the apoptosis of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells was distinctly increased, and the percentage of CD4+ cells and the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly decreased, as compared with normal controls. The apoptosis of T lymphocytes cultured with SLE serum was markedly higher than that of cells cultured with control's serum. Blockade of interleukin-10 (IL-10) activation by an anti-IL-10 antibody reduced the SLE serum induced apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The levels of sFas and sFasL in the culture supernatant and Fas and FasL mRNA expressions in cultured cells were significantly higher in the SLE serum-cultured groups, but decreased evidently in the presence of the anti-IL-10 antibody. Above findings suggested that SLE cells showed abnormally high apoptosis of T lymphocytes, especially of the CD4+ subpopulation, resulting in a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio. The high percentage of apoptotic T cells in SLE patients may be related to the high levels of IL-10 in SLE serum, as IL-10 may induce the abnormally activated T cells to trigger apoptosis via the Fas-FasL pathway.",

It is widely used as an immunosuppressive drug for treating rheumatic and arthritic diseases. In our previous studies, we found that sinomenine reduced cellular infiltration within the spinal cord and alleviated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats. In this study, we further investigated the mechanisms of sinomenine treatment in EAE rats. In EAE rats, treatment with sinomenine exerted an anti-inducible NO synthase (anti-iNOS) effect, which is related to the reductions of Th1 cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and its transcription factor, T-bet, in spinal cords. Moreover, sinomenine treatment of splenocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody and recombinant rat interleukin 12 reduced the expression of T-bet and IFN-\u03b3 in vitro and also reduced the capability of supernatants of splenocyte culture to induce iNOS expression by primary astrocytes. However, sinomenine had no direct inhibitory effect on iNOS produced by astrocytes cultured with IFN-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 in vitro. In conclusion, the anti-iNOS effect of sinomenine on EAE is mediated via the suppression of T-bet /IFN-\u03b3 pathway.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To study the effect of interferon-alpha IFN-\u03b1 in the serum of SLE patients on the differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) derived from CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells (HPCs). Methods: Serum samples from SLE patients and normal controls were collected and the concentration of IFN-\u03b1 detected by ELISA. CD34+HPCs were purified from cord blood by a magnetic cell sorting system (MACS), and cultured to differentiate to DCs. Normal serum, normal serum with exogenous IFN-\u03b1, SLE serum with raised levels of IFN-\u03b1, or SLE serum with anti-IFN-\u03b1 neutralizing antibody was added to the culture medium. The phenotype of DCs was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) and the capacity of DCs to stimulate allogenic T lymphocyte proliferation was evaluated in a mixed lymphocyte reaction by the Cell Counting Kit-8. Cytokine production was assessed by ELISA. Results: Serum levels of IFN-\u03b1 were significantly higher in SLE patients than in normal controls and this correlated positively with disease activity. Cultured in SLE serum with raised levels of IFN-\u03b1, CD34+ HPCs could differentiate into DCs that expressed higher levels of HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86, and showed an enhanced allogenic T-cell stimulatory capacity, while producing lower levels of IL-12 and higher amounts of IL-10 compared with those DCs cultured in normal serum. Conclusion: Increased levels of IFN-\u03b1 in SLE serum promotes the differentiation and maturation of DCs derived from CD34+ HPCs and could contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE.",

CD34(+) HPCs cultured in SLE serum containing elevated levels of IFN-alpha or IL-6 differentiated into DCs showing an increased expression of HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86, decreased IL-12 secretion along with increased IL-10 production, and an increased ability to stimulate allogenic T-cell proliferation, compared with DCs cultured in normal serum. DCs cultured with high levels of IFN-alpha increased the proportion of both CD3(+)CD8(-)IFN-gamma(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+)IFN-gamma(+) T-cell subsets, and increased the production of IFN-gamma in the allogenic MLR. DCs cultured with high levels of IL-6 decreased the proportion of both IFN-gamma(+) T-cell subsets, and decreased the secretion of IFN-gamma, but increased the production of IL-10. The IL-10 present in SLE serum did not significantly alter the phenotype or function of the DCs. IFN-alpha and IL-6 present in SLE serum induce CD34(+) HPCs to differentiate into DCs with different regulatory effects on T-cell differentiation, which might be involved in the initiation and maintenance of SLE.",

This study was aimed to investigate the immuno-modulatory function of candiate lactobacilli on T cells. Lactobacilli were isolated from healthy human feces and the microbiological characteristics were identified by API 50 CHL and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assays. Anti-CD3 antibody activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were treated by viable, heat-killed lactobacilli and genomic DNA of lactobacilli, and cytokine profiles were tested by ELISA. Isolated lactobacilli C44 and C48 were identified as L. acidophilus and L. paracacei, which have properties of acid and bile tolerance and inhibitor effects on pathogens. Viable and heat-killed C44 and C48 induced low levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8) and high levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12p70 in PBMCs. In anti-CD3 antibody activated PBMCs, viable and heat-killed C44 increased Th2 cytokine levels (IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10), and simultaneously enhanced Th1 responses by inducing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12p70 production. Different from that of lactabacillus strains, their genomic DNA induced low levels of IL-12p70, IFN-\u03b3 and proinflammatory cytokines in PBMCs with or without anti-CD3 antibody activation. These results provided in vitro evidence that the genomic DNA of strains of C44 and C48, especially C44, induced weaker inflammation, and may be potentially applied for treating allergic diseases.",

Serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are generally elevated in SLE patients, which might modulate the differentiation of DCs. In this study, DCs were induced from monocytes either by transendothelial trafficking or by culture with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) + IL-4 + tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Both systems were used to investigate the effects of elevated serum IL-10 level on DC differentiation in SLE patients. The results showed that monocyte-derived DCs induced by either SLE serum or exogenous IL-10 reduced the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR and CD80, decreased IL-12p40 level, and increased IL-10 level, and exhibited an impaired capacity to stimulate allogenic T-cell proliferation. These results indicate that serum IL-10 may be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE by modulating the differentiation and function of DCs.",

Many typical image encryption techniques take the direct way of scrambling the transmitted image itself, which may limit the scrambling effect that is achievable. A new image encryption algorithm is proposed in this paper. This algorithm uses various knight-tours on the chessboard as the basic tool for image scrambling, and scrambles the wavelet coefficients of the transmitted image instead of the image itself. Experimental results show that the algorithm can achieve better scrambling effect. Some useful conclusions are obtained through the analysis and explanation of the experimental data, which lay a solid foundation for further research.",

It includes two stages: (1) the wavelet coefficients in a frame are quantized by the threshold formed by the eye's sensitivity to their subband.

        "title": "A Bi-Virus Competing Spreading Model with Generic Infection Rates.",
        "abstract": "Due to widespread applications, the multi-virus competing spreading dynamics has recently aroused considerable interests. To our knowledge, all previous competing spreading models assume infection rates that are each linear in the virus occupancy probabilities of the individuals in a population. As linear infection rates are overestimation of real infection rates, in some situations these models cannot accurately predict the spreading process of multiple competing viruses. This work takes the first step toward enhancing the accuracy of multi-virus competing spreading models. A continuous-time bilayer-network-based bi-virus competing spreading model with generic infection rates is proposed. Criteria for the extinction of both viruses and for the survival of only one virus are presented, respectively. Numerical examples show that (1) if the generic bi-virus spreading model with linear infection rates predicts that the fraction of nodes infected with some virus would approach zero, the prediction of the fraction is accurate, and (2) if the scenario-relevant generic infection rates could be estimated accurately, the resulting model would be able to accurately forecast the evolutionary process of a pair of competing viruses.",

        "abstract": "Biological computing provides a promising approach to attacking computationally intractable problems. The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper addresses the problem of how to solve QAP under the Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model. A theoretically efficient DNA algorithm for solving QAP is proposed, which is executed by performing O( Kn 4 ) operations on test tubes of DNA molecular strands with n 2 + K + 1 bit regions, where n is the number of facilities, and K is the length of the binary representation of an upper bound on the objective function. With the rapid progress of molecular biology techniques, the proposed algorithm might be of practical use in treating medium-sized instances of QAP. Keywords Biological computing DNA algorithm Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model Quadratic assignment problem NP-hardness 1 Introduction In 1994, Adleman [1] experimentally demonstrated that modern molecular biology techniques could be employed to solve combinatorial problems involving large amount of searches. Due to appealing features such as high parallelism, huge memory storage and very low energy consumption, biological computing has become a new research field, and a number of biological computational models have been established and studied (for instances, the Adleman\u2013Lipton model [15] , the restriction-enzyme model [19] , the sticker model [20] , the surface-based model [16,24] , the self-assembly model [18,26] , the hairpin model [22] and the RNA model [8] ). It is known that the sticker model makes use of single-stranded DNA molecules with annealed stickers to represent binary strings [20] , while the Adleman\u2013Lipton model specifies a powerful set of operations on test tube of DNA molecules [15] . As a combination of these two models, the Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model has recently been applied to treat a diversity of hard combinatorial problems [2,5,6,11,12,27,28] . The quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which was introduced by Koopmans and Beckman [14] to model a facilities location problem, can be loosely described as follows. Given a set of n locations and n facilities, it is required that each facility be assigned to a location so that the total cost, which is defined as the sum of the cost between each pair of facilities multiplied by the distance between their assigned locations, is minimized. QAP has been well studied and has been used to model a large number of application as well as theoretical problems [3,7] . Sahni and Gonzalez [21] showed that finding a \u03b5 -approximate solution to QAP is NP-hard, which implies that QAP is one of the computationally hardest problems [10,25] . Indeed, the fastest-known (digital computer based) algorithms for solving QAP require an exponentially increasing time cost in instance size. As opposed to this, biological computing provides a potentially effective approach to tackling QAP. This paper addresses the problem of how to solve QAP under the Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model. A theoretically efficient DNA algorithm for solving QAP is proposed, which is executed in O( Kn 4 ) operations on test tubes of DNA molecule strands with n 2 + K + 1 bit regions, where n is the number of facilities (equivalently, the number of locations), and K is the length of the binary representation of an upper bound on the objective function. With the progress of molecular biology techniques, the proposed algorithm might be of practical use in treating medium-sized instances of QAP. The materials of this paper are organized in this fashion: Section 2 defines QAP and describes the Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model; Section 3 proposes a DNA algorithm for QAP, followed by a performance analysis; and Section 4 closes this work. 2 Preliminary knowledge This section is composed of two parts: the first part gives a formal description of QAP, while the second part explains the Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model. 2.1 Formal description of QAP A standard QAP is formulated as follows. ( QAP ) min \u2211 i = 1 n \u2211 j = 1 n \u2211 k = 1 n \u2211 l = 1 n c i , j d k , l x i , k x j , l s.t. \u2211 i = 1 n x i , j = 1 , j = 1 , \u2026 , n ; \u2211 j = 1 n x i , j = 1 , i = 1 , \u2026 , n ; x i , j \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , i , j = 1 , \u2026 , n ; where c i , j and d k , l are all nonnegative integers. Let C = ( c i , j ) n \u00d7 n , D = ( d i , j ) n \u00d7 n , X = ( x i , j ) n \u00d7 n , A = ( a i , j , k , l ) n \u00d7 n \u00d7 n \u00d7 n , where a i , j , k , l = c i , j \u00d7 d k , l . Then an instance of QAP can be described by the matrix-pair ( C , D ) or by the 4th-rank tensor A . Let K \u2254 log 2 \u2211 i = 1 n \u2211 j = 1 n K i , j + 1 , where K i , j \u2254 max { a i , j , k , l : 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d n , 1 \u2a7d l \u2a7d n } . It can be seen that K is the length of the binary representation of an upper bound on the objective function. Given an instance ( C , D ) of QAP, the calculations of tensor A and parameter K require only O( n 4 ) execution time on a digital computer and, hence, is regarded as the preprocessing stage of our DNA algorithm. For convenience, in what follows we assume that an instance of QAP takes the form ( A , K ). 2.2 The Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model The Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model is a biological computational model, under which a typical DNA algorithm uses single-stranded DNA molecules with annealed stickers as information carrier and performs a series of operations on test tubes of DNA strands. A detailed description of this model is given below. 2.2.1 Information representation A single-stranded DNA molecule is a sequence of nucleotides with four different bases (adenine (A), cytosine(C), guanine (G) and thymine (T)) strung together by covalent bonds. Under the Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model, the representation of a binary string involves two kinds of single-stranded DNA molecules: the longer memory strands and the shorter sticker strands ( stickers ). A typical memory strand is divided into L nonoverlapping regions (known as bits ) with B bases each (typically, B \u2254 20). A sticker is B -base long and is complementary to one and only one of the L bits according to the Watson\u2013Crick matching rule (A to T, G to C). A bit of a given memory strand assumes value 1 or 0 depending on whether there is a sticker annealed to this region or not. So, a memory strand can be regarded as a random access memory (RAM) from the viewpoint of computer science. Errors are inevitable in biochemical operations and, hence, an error-tolerant DNA algorithm is desired. Under the Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model, the error-resistant ability of a DNA algorithm is heavily dependent on the DNA code of the memory strand. For more information in the design of DNA codes, refer to [9,17,23] . Henceforth, let code [ L ] stand for the DNA code of an L -bit memory strand. When taking as input an instance ( A , K ) of QAP, our DNA algorithm will operates by performing operations on test tubes of ( n 2 + K + 1)-bit DNA strands, where every DNA strand is partitioned into two spaces ( Fig. 1 ): \u2022 Memory space , which is composed of the 1st through n 2 th bits. For 1 \u2a7d i , j \u2a7d n , the (( i \u2212 1) n + j )th bit in the strand will be logically viewed as bit M( i , j ) because it will record the value of x i , j of a quadratic assignment candidate. \u2022 Work space , which is composed of the ( n 2 + 1)th through ( n 2 + K + 1)th bits. For n 2 + 1 \u2a7d i \u2a7d n 2 + K + 1, the i th bit in the strand will be logically viewed as bit W( i ). Bits W(1) \u223c W( K ) will be used to calculate and store the value of the objective function, and bit W( K + 1) will be used to store the carry information. Such a DNA strand is called as an ( n 2 , K + 1) strand. Given such a strand s , we let s (M( i , j )) denote the value stored in bit M( i , j ), s (W( i )) the value in bit W( i ), s (M(1, 1): M( n , n )) the binary integer formed by the values in bit M(1, 1) through bit M( n , n ), and s (W(1):W( K )) the binary integer formed by the values stored in bit W(1) through bit W( K ). 2.2.2 Operations The Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model defines four principal operations on test tubes of DNA strands: merge , extract , set and clear . All of these operations have reasonable mathematical interpretations. \u2022 T \u2254 merge( T 1 , T 2 ). Given two test tubes T 1 and T 2 , get a test tube T containing all strands in T 1 and all strands in T 2 . \u2022 ( T 1 , T 0 ) \u2254 extract( T , i ). Given a test tube T and a bit index i , get two test tubes T 1 and T 0 , where T 1 and T 0 contain all those strands in T with value 1 and 0 in the i th bit, respectively. \u2022 T \u2254 set( T 0 , i ). Given a test tube T 0 and a bit index i , get a test tube T by setting bit i of all strands in T 0 as 1. \u2022 T \u2254 clear( T 0 , i ). Given a test tube T 0 and a bit index i , get a test tube T by setting bit i of all strands in T 0 as 0. During the preparation of the initial test tube, three additional operations are necessary: make , amplify and separate . \u2022 T \u2254 make( co ). Given the code co of a DNA sequence, get a test tube T of exactly one single-stranded DNA molecule that is encoded with co . \u2022 T \u2254 amplify( T 0 , p ). Given a test tube T 0 and a positive integer p , get a test tube T that contains p copies of every DNA strand in T 0 . \u2022 ( T 1 , T 0 ) \u2254 separate( T ). Given a test tube T , get two test tubes T 1 and T 0 , each of which contains one half of the contents in T . For the purpose of obtaining the final result, we need two more operations: detect and read . \u2022 bool \u2254 detect( T ): Given a test tube T , get a Boolean variable bool , which assumes value yes or no according as there exists a DNA strand in T or not. \u2022 s \u2254 read( T ): Given a test tube T of at least one DNA strand, get a strand s in T . For the implementation details of these biochemical operations, refer to [20] . 3 A DNA algorithm for QAP This section starts with an explanation of the basic idea of the DNA algorithm. 3.1 The basic idea of the algorithm The basic idea behind our DNA algorithm for solving QAP is to find an optimal solution by checking all possible solution candidates by brute force. Specifically, this algorithm consists of four stages: \u2022 Prepare the set T of all possible quadratic assignment candidates. \u2022 Determine the set T of all feasible quadratic assignments by excluding all those unfeasible quadratic assignments from T . \u2022 Evaluate the objective function for all feasible quadratic assignments in T . \u2022 Pick out a quadratic assignment in T so that the objective function is minimized. For our purpose, the code of an ( n 2 + K + 1)-bit memory strand is assumed to be known. On this basis, let us develop five DNA routines and analyze the numbers of test tube operations involved in them. 3.2 DNA initialization Procedure T \u2254 dna _ init ( n , K , r ) Input: n , K , r : three positive integers. Output: T : a test tube that contains r copies of each ( n 2 , K + 1) strand that has 1 or 0 in each bit of the memory space and has 0 in each bit of the work space. begin 1.

Output: a binary string x 1,1 , x 1,2 , \u2026 , x n , n such that X = ( x i , j ) n \u00d7 n is an optimal solution to this instance. begin 1. T \u2254 init( n 2 , K + 1, r ); 2. T \u2254 dna-check( T ); 3. T \u2254 dna-sum( T , A ); 4. s \u2254 dna-opt( T ); 5. return( s (M(1, 1): M( n , n ))); end By combining Lemmas 1\u20135 , we get Theorem\u00a06 Algorithm dna _ qap is executed in (9K + 3) n 4 + 2n 3 + 5n 2 + 2K + 4 = (Kn 4 ) test tube operations. 4 Summary Under the Adleman\u2013Lipton-sticker model, a DNA algorithm for the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) has been proposed. This algorithm is executed in O( Kn 4 ) operations on test tubes of ( n 2 + K + 1)-bit DNA strands, where n is the number of facilities, and K is the length of the binary representation of an upper bound on the objective function. With the progress of biochemical techniques, the proposed algorithm may be of practical use in tackling medium-sized instances of QAP. Our current work is to explore the possibility of solving QAP under other biological computational models such as the hairpin model [22] and the RNA model [8] .

        "title": "A lower bound on the size of k-neighborhood in generalized cubes",
        "abstract": "The determination of the minimum size of a k -neighborhood (i.e., a neighborhood of a set of k nodes) in a given graph is essential in the analysis of diagnosability and fault tolerance of multicomputer systems. The generalized cubes include the hypercube and most hypercube variants as special cases. In this paper, we present a lower bound on the size of a k -neighborhood in n -dimensional generalized cubes, where 2 n + 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3 n \u2212 2. This lower bound is tight in that it is met by the n -dimensional hypercube. Our result is an extension of two previously known results. Keywords Interconnection network Hypercube Generalized cube k -neighborhood 1 Introduction The hypercube structure has long been adopted as the topology of interconnection networks in multicomputer systems [12] . The hypercube, however, does not enjoy the smallest diameter for its resources, which implies it may suffer from longer communication delay. To achieve smaller diameter with the same numbers of nodes and links, a number of hypercube variants were proposed [2,4,6,7,14,20] . As a generalization of hypercube networks, the hypercube-like networks have received considerable attention [5,8,11,15,17] . Park and Chwa [13] and Fan and Lin [9] studied a special class of hypercube-like networks named as the BC graphs , which include most hypercube variants [2,4,6,7,14,20] as special cases. In this paper, we referred to the BC graphs as the generalized cubes to stress their similarity to hypercube. In this paper, we consider the following problem: Minimum neighborhood problem (MNP): Let \u03b8 G ( k ) denote the minimum size of a k -neighborhood (i.e, a neighborhood of a set of k nodes) in graph G . Determine \u03b8 G ( k ). The MNP is not only of interest in its own right, but the obtained result is useful in system-level fault diagnosis [3,9,11,16] and in the analysis of fault tolerance of interconnection networks [18,19] . For the n -dimensional hypercube Q n , Somani and Peleg [16] showed that, for 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d n + 1, \u03b8 Q n ( k ) = - 1 2 k 2 + ( n - 1 2 ) k + 1 . For any n -dimensional generalized cube G , Fan and Lin [9] found that, for 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d n + 1, \u03b8 G ( k ) \u2a7e - 1 2 k 2 + ( n - 1 2 ) k + 1 . Recently, Yang et al. [22] reported that, for any n -dimensional generalized cube G and n + 2 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 2 n , \u03b8 G ( k ) \u2a7e - 1 2 k 2 + ( 2 n - 3 2 ) k - n 2 + 2 . For other related work the reader is referred to Refs. [1,21] . This paper addresses the MNP for n -dimensional generalized cubes. The main contribution of this paper is to prove that, for any n -dimensional generalized cube G and 2 n + 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3 n \u2212 2, \u03b8 G ( k ) \u2a7e - 1 2 k 2 + 3 n - 7 2 k - 3 n 2 + 4 n + 2 . This inequality is optimal in that the hypercube meets this bound. Clearly, our result is an extension of the aforementioned two results. As a byproduct, our result applies to various hypercube variants, including the twisted cube [2] , the crossed cube [7] , the M\u00f6bius cube [6] , and the locally twisted cube [20] . The remaining materials are organized in this fashion: Preliminary knowledge is provided in Section 2 . The main result is formulated and proved in Section 3 . Some remarks are made in Section 4 . 2 Preliminaries In this paper, we use a graph G = ( V ( G ), E ( G )) to represent an interconnection network, where the nodes and edges represent the processors and communication links, respectively. For a set S of nodes in graph G , let N G ( S ) = { v \u2208 V ( G ) \u2212 S : there is u \u2208 S such that ( u , v ) \u2208 E ( G )}, N G [ S ] = N G ( S ) \u222a S . For our purpose, let us introduce the following notation: \u03b8 G ( k ) = min { | N G ( S ) | : S is a set of k nodes in graph G } . An n -dimensional hypercube, denoted Q n , is a graph on 2 n nodes in which the nodes can be one-to-one labeled with binary sequences of length n so that two nodes are adjacent if and only if their labels differ in exactly one bit position. For other fundamental graph-theoretic terminology the reader is referred to Ref. [10] . Definition\u00a02.1 [9,13] An n -dimensional generalized cube is defined recursively in the following fashion: (1) A one-dimensional generalized cube is a graph on a single node. (2) For n \u2a7e 2, an n -dimensional generalized cube G is built from two disjoint ( n \u2212 1)-dimensional generalized cubes G 1 and G 2 by adding a set of edges M \u03d5 = {( u , \u03d5 ( u )) : u \u2208 V ( G 1 )}, where \u03d5 is a bijective mapping from V ( G 1 ) to V ( G 2 ). A generalized cube G so constructed is denoted by G = ( G 1 , G 2 ; M \u03d5 ). For an edge ( u , v ) \u2208 M \u03d5 , u is called as the \u03d5 -neighbor of v , and vice versa. In the sense of isomorphism, the length-4 cycle is the unique two-dimensional generalized cube. In the sense of isomorphism, there are only two three-dimensional generalized cubes, which are shown in Fig. 2.1 . Fig. 2.2 shows five typical four-dimensional generalized cubes. In order to estimate \u03b8 G ( k ) for n -dimensional generalized cubes, three families of quadratic functions, { p n ( x )} n \u2a7e1 , { q n ( x )} n \u2a7e1 and { r n ( x )} n \u2a7e1 are necessary, which are defined as p n ( x ) = - 1 2 x 2 + n - 1 2 x + 1 , q n ( x ) = - 1 2 x 2 + 2 n - 3 2 x - n 2 + 2 , r n ( x ) = - 1 2 x 2 + 3 n - 7 2 x - 3 n 2 + 4 n + 2 . Lemma\u00a02.1 Lemma 4 in [9] , Lemma 5 in [16] Let G be an n-dimensional generalized cube. Then \u03b8 G (k) \u2a7e p n (k) for 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d n + 1. Moreover, this inequality is optimal in that \u03b8 Q n ( k ) = p n ( k ) for 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d n + 1. Lemma\u00a02.2 Theorem 3.1 in [22] Let G be an n-dimensional generalized cube. Then \u03b8 G (k) \u2a7e q n (k) for n + 2 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 2n. Moreover, this inequality is optimal in that \u03b8 Q n ( k ) = q n ( k ) for n + 2 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 2n. For our purpose, the following properties of p n ( x ), q n ( x ) and r n ( x ) are necessary. Their proofs are straightforward and are omitted. Lemma\u00a02.3 r n ( x ) = r n +1 ( x ) \u2212 3 x + 6 n \u2212 1. Lemma\u00a02.4 r n (x) = r n+1 (x + 1) \u2212 2x + 3n. Lemma\u00a02.5 r n (x) = r n+1 (x + 2) \u2212 x + 2. Lemma\u00a02.6 r n (x) = r n+1 (x + 3) \u2212 3n + 5. Lemma\u00a02.7 p n (x) + q n (y) = r n+1 (x + y) + (x \u2212 n \u2212 1)(y \u2212 2n). Lemma\u00a02.8 p n (x) + r n (y) = r n+1 (x + y) + (x \u2212 3)(y \u2212 2n). Lemma\u00a02.9 q n (x) + q n (y) = r n+1 (x + y) + (x \u2212 n \u2212 1)(y \u2212 n \u2212 1). 3 Main result The main result of this paper is formulated below. Theorem\u00a03.1 Let G be an n-dimensional generalized cube. Then \u03b8 G (k) \u2a7e r n (k) for 2n + 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3n \u2212 2. Moreover, this inequality is optimal in that \u03b8 Q n ( k ) = r n ( k ) for 2n + 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3n \u2212 2. In order to prove this theorem, we need the following three lemmas. Lemma\u00a03.2 Let G be a graph on N nodes. Then \u03b8 G (k + 1) \u2a7e \u03b8 G (k) \u2212 1 for 0 \u2a7d k \u2a7d N \u2212 1. Proof Let S be an arbitrary set of ( k + 1) nodes in G . It suffices to show that \u2223 N G ( S )\u2223 \u2a7e \u03b8 G ( k ) \u2212 1. Let u be a node in S . We have \u2223 N G ( S \u2212 { u })\u2223 \u2a7e \u03b8 G ( k ). Let f ( u ) = | { v \u2208 N G ( u ) : v \u2208\u0338 N G [ S - { u } ] } | , g ( u ) = 1 , u is adjacent to some node in S - { u } ; 0 , otherwise . Then \u2223 N G ( S )\u2223 = \u2223 N G ( S \u2212 { u })\u2223 + f ( u ) \u2212 g ( u ) \u2a7e \u2223 N G ( S \u2212 { u })\u2223 \u2212 1 \u2a7e \u03b8 G ( k ) \u2212 1. \u25a1 Lemma\u00a03.3 Let G be an n-dimensional generalized cube. Then \u03b8 G (k) \u2a7e r n (k) for 2n + 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3n \u2212 2. Proof We argue by induction on the dimensionality of the generalized cubes. This claim is obviously true for the two three-dimensional generalized cubes shown in Fig. 2.1 . Suppose that this claim is true for all the m -dimensional generalized cubes, where m \u2a7e 3 is any given integer. Now, consider an arbitrary ( m + 1)-dimensional generalized cube G = ( G 1 , G 2 ; M \u03d5 ). Let S be an arbitrary set of k nodes in G , where 2 m + 3 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3 m + 1. We need to show \u2223 N G ( S )\u2223 \u2a7e r m +1 ( k ). To this end, we let S 1 = S \u2229 V ( G 1 ), k 1 = \u2223 S 1 \u2223, S 2 = S \u2229 V ( G 2 ), k 2 = \u2223 S 2 \u2223. Without loss of generality, we may assume k 1 \u2a7d k 2 . Then k 1 \u2a7d \u230a k /2\u230b \u2a7d \u230a(3 m + 1)/2\u230b \u2a7d 2 m . Let T denote the set of the \u03d5 -neighbors of all the nodes in S 2 . We proceed by distinguishing among five possibilities. Case 1. k 1 = 0. We further consider four subcases. Subcase 1.1. 2 m + 3 \u2a7d k 2 \u2a7d 3 m \u2212 2. It follows from the inductive hypothesis and Lemma 2.3 that | N G ( S ) | = | T | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e k 2 + \u03b8 G 2 ( k 2 ) \u2a7e k 2 + r m ( k 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k 2 ) - 2 k 2 + 6 m - 1 \u2a7e r m + 1 ( k 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Subcase 1.2. k 2 = 3 m \u2212 1. It follows from Lemma 3.2 , the inductive hypothesis and Lemma 2.4 that | N G ( S ) | = | T | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e ( 3 m - 1 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m - 1 ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 2 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m - 2 ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 2 ) + r m ( 3 m - 2 ) = r m + 1 ( 3 m - 1 ) + 2 \u2a7e r m + 1 ( 3 m - 1 ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Subcase 1.3. k 2 = 3 m . It follows from Lemma 3.2 , the inductive hypothesis and Lemma 2.5 that | N G ( S ) | = | T | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e 3 m + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 2 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m - 2 ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 2 ) + r m ( 3 m - 2 ) = r m + 1 ( 3 m ) + 2 \u2a7e r m + 1 ( 3 m ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Subcase 1.4. k 2 = 3 m + 1. It follows from Lemma 3.2 , the inductive hypothesis and Lemma 2.6 that | N G ( S ) | = | T | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e ( 3 m + 1 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m + 1 ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 2 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m - 2 ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 2 ) + r m ( 3 m - 2 ) = r m + 1 ( 3 m + 1 ) + 3 \u2a7e r m + 1 ( 3 m + 1 ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Case 2. k 1 = 1. We further consider three subcases. Subcase 2.1. 2 m + 2 \u2a7d k 2 \u2a7d 3 m \u2212 2. It follows from the inductive hypothesis and Lemma 2.4 that | N G ( S ) | \u2a7e | T - S 1 | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e ( k 2 - 1 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( k 2 ) \u2a7e ( k 2 - 1 ) + r m ( k 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k 2 + 1 ) - k 2 + 3 m - 1 \u2a7e r m + 1 ( k 2 + 1 ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Subcase 2.2. k 2 = 3 m \u2212 1. It follows from Lemma 3.2 , the inductive hypothesis and Lemma 2.5 that | N G ( S ) | = | T - S 1 | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e ( 3 m - 2 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m - 1 ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 3 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m - 2 ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 3 ) + r m ( 3 m - 2 ) = r m + 1 ( 3 m ) + 1 \u2a7e r m + 1 ( 3 m ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Subcase 2.3 . k 2 = 3 m . It follows from Lemma 3.2 , the inductive hypothesis and Lemma 2.6 that | N G ( S ) | = | T - S 1 | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e ( 3 m - 1 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 3 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m - 2 ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 3 ) + r m ( 3 m - 2 ) = r m + 1 ( 3 m + 1 ) + 2 \u2a7e r m + 1 ( 3 m + 1 ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Case 3. k 1 = 2. We further consider two subcases. Subcase 3.1. 2 m + 1 \u2a7d k 2 \u2a7d 3 m \u2212 2. It follows from the inductive hypothesis and Lemma 2.5 that | N G ( S ) | = | T - S 1 | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e ( k 2 - 2 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( k 2 ) \u2a7e ( k 2 - 2 ) + r m ( k 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k 2 + 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Subcase 3.2. k 2 = 3 m \u2212 1. It follows from Lemma 3.2 , the inductive hypothesis and Lemma 2.6 that | N G ( S ) | = | T - S 1 | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e ( 3 m - 3 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m - 1 ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 4 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( 3 m - 2 ) \u2a7e ( 3 m - 4 ) + r m ( 3 m - 2 ) = r m + 1 ( 3 m + 1 ) + 1 \u2a7e r m + 1 ( 3 m + 1 ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Case 4. 3 \u2a7d k 1 \u2a7d m + 1. Then m + 2 = ( 2 m + 3 ) - ( m + 1 ) \u2a7d k - ( m + 1 ) \u2a7d k 2 \u2a7d k - 3 \u2a7d ( 3 m + 1 ) - 3 = 3 m - 2 . We have two possibilities. Subcase 4.1. m + 2 \u2a7d k 2 \u2a7d 2 m . From Lemmas 2.1, 2.2 and 2.7 , we get | N G ( S ) | \u2a7e | N G 1 ( S 1 ) | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e \u03b8 G 1 ( k 1 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( k 2 ) \u2a7e p m ( k 1 ) + q m ( k 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k 1 + k 2 ) + ( k 1 - m - 1 ) ( k 2 - 2 m ) \u2a7e r m + 1 ( k 1 + k 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Subcase 4.2. 2 m + 1 \u2a7d k 2 \u2a7d 3 m \u2212 2. From Lemma 2.1 , the inductive hypothesis and Lemma 2.8 , we get | N G ( S ) | \u2a7e | N G 1 ( S 1 ) | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e \u03b8 G 1 ( k 1 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( k 2 ) \u2a7e p m ( k 1 ) + r m ( k 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k 1 + k 2 ) + ( k 1 - 3 ) ( k 2 - 2 m ) \u2a7e r m + 1 ( k 1 + k 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . Case 5 . m + 2 \u2a7d k 1 \u2a7d 2 m . Then m + 2 \u2a7d k 1 \u2a7d k 2 \u2a7d k - ( m + 2 ) \u2a7d ( 3 m + 1 ) - ( m + 2 ) = 2 m - 1 . From Lemmas 2.2 and 2.9 , we get | N G ( S ) | \u2a7e | N G 1 ( S 1 ) | + | N G 2 ( S 2 ) | \u2a7e \u03b8 G 1 ( k 1 ) + \u03b8 G 2 ( k 2 ) \u2a7e q m ( k 1 ) + q m ( k 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k 1 + k 2 ) + ( k 1 - m - 1 ) ( k 2 - m - 1 ) \u2a7e r m + 1 ( k 1 + k 2 ) = r m + 1 ( k ) . From the previous discussions, we induce that the claim is true for all the ( m + 1)-dimensional generalized cubes. This completes the inductive proof of the lemma. \u25a1 Lemma\u00a03.4 \u03b8 Q n ( k ) = r n ( k ) for 2n + 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3n \u2212 2. Proof From Lemma 3.3 , we have \u03b8 Q n ( k ) \u2a7e r n ( k ) for 2n + 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3 n \u2212 2. On the other hand, we choose a set S of k nodes from Q n by employing the following breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: ALGORITHM CHOOSE_NODE INPUT: An integer n \u2a7e 1; an integer k satisfying 0 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 2 n . OUTPUT: A set S of k nodes in Q n . BEGIN /* Whenever all of the nodes in Q n need to be scanned, the scanning proceeds from node 0 n to node 1 n in the lexical order; */ FOR each node u in Q n Label u with \u201cunelected\u201d; Let Q be an initially empty queue; Let S be an initially empty set; IF k > 0 THEN BEGIN Add node 0 n to Q ; Label node 0 n with \u201celected\u201d; END; WHILE \u2223 S \u2223 < k DO BEGIN Let u be the first node in Q ; Remove u from Q ; Add u to S ; FOR each node v in Q n IF ( v is adjacent to u ) & ( v is \u201cunelected\u201d) THEN BEGIN Add v to Q ; Label v with \u201celected\u201d; END; END; END. For example, when running on n = 4 and k = 9, algorithm CHOOSE_NODE will return S = {0000, 0001, 0010, 0100, 1000, 0011, 0101, 1001, 0110} (see Fig. 3.1 ). Given any integer n \u2a7e 3 and any integer k satisfying 2 n + 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3 n \u2212 2, let S n , k denote the node subset obtained by running algorithm CHOOSE_NODE on n and k . It is easily verified that | N Q n ( S n , k ) | = n + [ ( n - 2 ) + ( n - 3 ) + \u22ef + ( - 1 ) ] + [ ( n - 3 ) + ( n - 4 ) + \u22ef + ( - 1 ) ] + { ( n - 4 ) + ( n - 5 ) + \u22ef + [ n - ( k - 2 n ) - 3 ] } = - 1 2 k 2 + 3 n - 7 2 k - 3 n 2 + 4 n + 2 = r n ( k ) . This implies \u03b8 Q n ( k ) \u2a7d r n ( k ) . \u25a1 We are ready to complete the proof of Theorem 3.1 . Proof of Theorem\u00a03.1 It follows from Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 . \u25a1 4 Conclusions The minimum k -neighborhood problem is not only of theoretic interest, but the obtained result is useful in the evaluation of fault tolerance and diagnosability of multiprocessor systems. In this paper, we have presented a tight lower bound on the size of a k -neighborhood in any n -dimensional generalized cube, where 2 n + 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3 n \u2212 2. When 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 3 n \u2212 2, the result presented in this paper and those given in [9,22] jointly give a tight lower bound on the size of a k -neighborhood in an n -dimensional generalized cube. When 3 n \u2212 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 2 n , the minimum k -neighborhood problem remains open for n -dimensional generalized cubes.

This paper focuses on the issue of efficiently executing a parallel algorithm with bidirectional/unidirectional ternary n-cube communication pattern on a ring-connected WDM optical network.

        "abstract": "Unlike new medical procedures, new antivirus software can be disseminated rapidly through the Internet and takes effect immediately after it is run. As a result, a considerable number of infected computers can be cured almost simultaneously. Consequently, it is of practical importance to understand how pulse treatment affects the spread of computer viruses. For this purpose, an impulsive malware propagation model is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer virus model that takes into account the effect of pulse treatment. The dynamic properties of this model are investigated comprehensively. Specifically, it is found that (a) the virus-free periodic solution is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction ratio (BRR) is less than unity, (b) infections are permanent when the BRR exceeds unity, and (c) a locally asymptotically stable viral periodic solution bifurcates from the virus-free periodic solution when the BRR goes through unity. A close inspection of the influence of different model parameters on the BRR allows us to suggest some feasible measures of eradicating electronic infections.",

Two computer compartments with different infection rate are established. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviors of this model are investigated by stability theory and numerical simulations. It is found that the dynamical properties of this model are determined by basic reproductive rate. Specifically, virus-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproductive rate is less than or equal to one , whereas the local asymptotical stability of the viral equilibrium is guaranteed if basic reproductive rate is bigger than one, followed by a conjecture on its global stability. Then the sensitivity analysis of basic reproductive rate to the system parameters is investigated and a collection of policies is advised to control the spread of computer virus over the Internet.",

NMR data of this diamagnetic product indicate C 2 v symmetry, which is contradicted by the X-ray structure, which shows it to be nonplanar at Ni, with a geometry intermediate between planar and tetrahedral; the planar geometry is thus the transition state for fluxionality giving time-averaged C 2 v symmetry. The X-ray structure, together with DFT calculations, reveals that the \"half-bent\" NiNO unit and the intermediate coordination geometry result from a Ni --> NO charge transfer, which has a nonintegral value, resulting in a continuum between NO (+) (hence Ni (0)) and NO (-) (hence Ni (II)). This is related to the nonaxially symmetric character of the Ni --> NO back-donation caused by the (PNP) environment on Ni. Steric effects of ( t )Bu and even chelate constraints are ruled out as the cause of the unusual electronic and structural features.",

The proposed watermarking algorithm scrambles the binary image watermark that may protect copyright and embeds it into the low frequency wavelet coefficients of the host image. The human visual system (HVS) characteristics are taken into consideration during the watermark embedding process so as to keep the watermark invisible. Then an RBF neural network is used to learn the characteristics of the embedded watermark related to the watermarked image. With the aid of the learning and adaptive capabilities of neural networks, the trained neural network can exactly recover the watermark from the watermarked image. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm has a good imperceptibility and high robustness to various common image processing attacks.",

Firms must persuade consumers, through their personal network and with the support of the Internet to become the vehicles which can disseminate the positive information. This paper addresses the modeling and analysis of the viral marketing for a consistent set of items. We develop a node-level positive comments mixed spreading model with positive comments and discount pricing mechanism, and thereby we measure the profit of the marketing. Next, we show that the model admits an optimal control, and we present the optimality system for solving the model.

        "abstract": "Although there are only a few known examples of supported single-atom catalysts, they are unique because they bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report the CO oxidation activity of monodisperse single Pt atoms supported on an inert substrate, \u03b8-alumina (Al2O3), in the presence of stoichiometric oxygen. Since CO oxidation on single Pt atoms cannot occur via a conventional Langmuir-Hinshelwood scheme (L-H scheme) which requires at least one Pt-Pt bond, we carried out a first-principles density functional theoretical study of a proposed pathway which is a variation on the conventional L-H scheme and inspired by the organometallic chemistry of platinum. We find that a single supported Pt atom prefers to bond to O2 over CO. CO then bonds with the oxygenated Pt atom and forms a carbonate which dissociates to liberate CO2, leaving an oxygen atom on Pt. Subsequent reaction with another CO molecule regenerates the single-atom catalyst. The energetics of the proposed mechanism suggests that the single Pt atoms will get covered with CO3 unless the temperature is raised to eliminate CO2. We find evidence for CO3 coverage at room temperature supporting the proposed mechanism in an in situ diffuse reflectance infrared study of CO adsorption on the catalyst's supported single atoms. Thus, our results clearly show that supported Pt single atoms are catalytically active and that this catalytic activity can occur without involving the substrate. Characterization by electron microscopy and X-ray absorption studies of the monodisperse Pt/\u03b8-Al2O3 are also presented.",

Chia, Siew-Hui Ong, Generalized knight's tours on rectangular chessboards, Discrete Applied Mathematics 150 (2005) 80-98], Chia and Ong proposed the notion of the generalized knight's tour problem (GKTP). In this paper, we address the 3D GKTP, that is, the GKTP on 3D chessboards of size LxMxN, where L@?M@?N. We begin by presenting several sufficient conditions for a 3D chessboard not to admit a closed or open generalized knight's tour (GKT) with given move patterns. Then, we turn our attention to the 3D GKTP with (1, 2, 2) move. First, we show that a chessboard of size LxMxN does not have a closed GKT if either (a) L@?2 or L=4, or (b) L=3 and M@?7. Then, we constructively prove that a chessboard of size 3x4sx4t with s=2and t=2 must contain a closed GKT.",

For the purpose of accurately evaluating the performance of the decentralized patch distribution mechanism and based on the exact SIPS model that accurately captures the average dynamics of the interaction between viruses and patches, a new virus-patch interacting model, which is known as the generic SIPS model, is proposed. This model subsumes the linear SIPS model. The dynamics of the generic SIPS model is studied comprehensively. In particular, a set of criteria for the final extinction or/and long-term survival of viruses or/and patches are presented. Some conditions for the linear SIPS model to accurately capture the average dynamics of the virus-patch interaction are empirically found. As a consequence, the linear SIPS model can be adopted as a standard model for assessing the performance of the distributed patch distribution mechanism, provided the proper conditions are satisfied.",

Under the Maeng\u2013Malek comparison model (MM* model), Sengupta and Dahbura proposed an O( N 5 ) diagnosis algorithm for general diagnosable systems with N nodes. Thanks to lower diameter and better graph embedding capability as compared with a hypercube of the same size, the crossed cube has been a promising candidate for interconnection networks. In this paper, we propose a fault diagnosis algorithm tailored for crossed cube connected multicomputer systems under the MM* model. By introducing appropriate data structures, this algorithm runs in O ( N log 2 2 N ) time, which is linear in the size of the input. As a result, this algorithm is significantly superior to the Sengupta\u2013Dahbura's algorithm when applied to crossed cube systems.",

We present a necessary and sufficient condition for an m \u00d7 n mesh ( m \u2a7e 4 and n \u2a7e 4 are even) with two faulty nodes to have a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle, which generalizes a result owing to Kim and Yoon [J.S. Kim, S.H. Yoon, Embedding of rings in 2-D meshes and tori with faulty nodes, Journal of Systems Architecture 43 (9) (1997) 643\u2013654]. We also describe an efficient scheme for constructing such a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle, if there is. Keywords Mesh Hamiltonian cycle Fault tolerance 1 Introduction A two-dimensional (2D) rectangular mesh can be laid out on a VLSI chip in an area that increases linearly with the number of processors (nodes). Because of the short, local connections between nodes, the area consumed by the wires is negligible, and the signal propagation delay between adjacent nodes is quite small. Due to these advantages, 2D meshes have received considerable attention from parallel processing community, and a number of mesh-connected parallel computers are commercially available [9] . In the design of parallel algorithms, linear arrays and rings are two typical communication schemes between processes. In order to efficiently implement a linear-array-based or ring-based parallel algorithm on a mesh-connected parallel computer, one needs to find a long path/cycle within the mesh network. Chen et al. [2] presented a fast sequential algorithm as well as its parallelized version for constructing Hamiltonian paths between two nodes in a mesh. Collins and Krompart [4] and Stoyan and Strehl [11] studied the number of Hamiltonian paths and Hamiltonian cycles in a mesh, respectively. The growing size of mesh-connected computer systems increases the probability of the event that there exist failing nodes in such systems. To maintain system\u2019s high availability, it is crucial to locate the faulty nodes therein by means of system-level fault diagnosis [1] . Once the failing nodes are identified, the next work is to identify a long fault-free path/cycle. Itai et al. [6] proved that it is NP-complete to determine whether a 2D-mesh with arbitrary fault nodes possesses a Hamiltonian cycle; so no polynomial-time algorithm exists for this problem unless P = NP. Hedetniemi et al. [5] proposed a ring embedding method in a mesh with a single faulty node. Kim and Yoon [7] found a necessary and sufficient condition for a Hamiltonian m \u00d7 n mesh ( m and n are multiples of four) in the presence of two faulty nodes; they also devised an algorithm for constructing such a Hamiltonian cycle, if there is, by partitioning the original mesh into 4 \u00d7 4 submeshes, building an appropriate fault-free Hamiltonian path for each submesh, and merging these short paths to yield a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle of the original mesh. For some related work the reader is referred to [3,8,10] . This paper addresses the Hamiltonian properties of an m \u00d7 n mesh ( m \u2a7e 4 and n \u2a7e 4 are even) in the presence of two failing nodes. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for such a faulty mesh to have a Hamiltonian cycle; our condition generalizes a result owing to Kim and Yoon [7] . Furthermore, we describe a systematic method for constructing such a Hamiltonian cycle, if there is; our method is different from the one used by Kim and Yoon in that the original mesh is partitioned into atmost five submeshes instead of a large number of 4 \u00d7 4 submeshes. The materials of this work are organized as follows. Section 2 provides the preliminary knowledge. The Hamiltonian properties of some typical (complete or incomplete) meshes are explored in Section 3 . Based on this, the main theorem of this work is established in Section 4 . We make some remarks in Section 5 to close our work. 2 Preliminaries An m \u00d7 n (rectangular) mesh is a graph of m \u00d7 n nodes arranged in m rows and n columns, where the node lying in the i th row and j th column is identified with an ordered pair ( i , j ), and two nodes ( i , j ), ( k , l ) are adjacent if and only if either (a) i = k , \u2223 j \u2212 l \u2223 = 1, or (b) j = l , \u2223 i \u2212 k \u2223 = 1. Fig. 2.1 shows a 6 \u00d7 8 mesh. An m \u00d7 n mesh is a bipartite graph with the bipartition ( U 0 , U 1 ), where U 0 = { ( i , j ) : 1 \u2a7d i \u2a7d m , 1 \u2a7d j \u2a7d n , i + j is even } , U 1 = { ( i , j ) : 1 \u2a7d i \u2a7d m , 1 \u2a7d j \u2a7d n , i + j is odd } . A mesh possesses multiple submeshes; each of such submeshes can be uniquely determined by its top-left corner node and bottom-right corner node. In what follows we use the symbol M (( i , j ), ( k , l )) to denote the submesh with ( i , j ) and ( k , l ) as the top-left corner and bottom-right corner nodes, respectively. Fig. 2.2 gives two illustrative submeshes in a 6 \u00d7 8 mesh. Especially, an m \u00d7 n mesh is denoted by M ((1, 1), ( m , n )). An m \u00d7 n torus is obtained from an m \u00d7 n mesh by adding all the edges \u3008(1, i ), ( m , i )\u3009 (1 \u2a7d i \u2a7d n ) and \u3008( j , 1), ( j , n )\u3009 (1 \u2a7d j \u2a7d m ), which is denoted by T ((1, 1), ( m , n )). Fig. 2.3 shows a 6 \u00d7 8 torus. 3 Hamiltonian properties of some complete and incomplete meshes In this section, the Hamiltonian properties of some typical complete and incomplete meshes are explored, which will be useful for the establishment of the main result of this paper. Lemma\u00a03.1 Let m \u2a7e 1 be an integer, n \u2a7e 2 an even number. Then the mesh M((1, 1), (m, n)) has a Hamiltonian path from node (1, 1) to node (1, n). Proof We can build a Hamiltonian path of M ((1, 1), ( m , n )) as follows: ( 1 , 1 ) \u2192 along the first column ( m , 1 ) \u2192 ( m , 2 ) \u2192 along the second column ( 1 , 2 ) \u2192 ( 1 , 3 ) \u2192 \u22ef \u2192 ( 1 , n - 1 ) \u2192 along the ( n - 1 ) th column ( m , n - 1 ) \u2192 ( m , n ) \u2192 along the n th column ( 1 , n ) . Fig. 3.1 shows such a Hamiltonian path of M ((1, 1), (5, 8)). \u25a1 In what follows we refer to such a Hamiltonian path of M ((1, 1), ( m , n )) as a ladder - shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, 1) to node (1, n ). Lemma\u00a03.2 Let m \u2a7e 2 be an integer, n \u2a7e 2 an even number. Then the mesh M((1, 1), (m, n)) has a Hamiltonian cycle. Proof We can build a Hamiltonian cycle as follows. First, we construct a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path of the submesh M ((2, 1), ( m , n )) from node (2, 1) to node (2, n ). Second, we build a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path of the submesh M ((1, 1), (1, n )) from node (1, 1) to node (1, n ). Then we have a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), ( m , n )) from these two paths by adding two edges \u3008(1, 1), (2, 1)\u3009 and \u3008(1, n ), (2, n )\u3009. Fig. 3.2 shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (5, 8)). \u25a1 In what follows we refer to such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), ( m , n )) as a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the first row as reference . Lemma\u00a03.3 Let m \u2a7e 3 be an odd number, n \u2a7e 4 an even number. Let G = M((1, 1), (m, n)) \u2212 { (1, 1), (m, n) } . Then G admits a Hamiltonian cycle. Proof There are two possibilities. Case 1 : n = 4. Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), ( m , 2)) \u2212 (1, 1), G 2 = M ((1, 3), ( m , 4)) \u2212 ( m , 4). Clearly, G 1 has a unique Hamiltonian path from node (1, 2) to node ( m , 2), G 2 has a unique Hamiltonian path from node (1, 3) to node ( m , 3). We then obtain a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these two paths by adding two edges \u3008(1, 2), (1, 3)\u3009 and \u3008( m , 2), ( m , 3)\u3009. Fig. 3.3 (a) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (5, 4)) \u2212 {(1, 1), (5, 4)}. Case 2 : n \u2a7e 6. Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), ( m , 2)) \u2212 (1, 1), G 2 = M ((1, n \u2212 1), ( m , n )) \u2212 ( m , n ), G 3 = M ((1, 3), ( m \u2212 1, n \u2212 2)), G 4 = M (( m , 3), ( m , n \u2212 2)). Clearly, G 1 has a unique Hamiltonian path from node (1, 2) to node ( m , 2), G 2 has a unique Hamiltonian path from node (1, n \u2212 1) to node ( m , n \u2212 1). From Lemma 3.1 , G 3 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, 3) to node (1, n \u2212 2), G 4 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node ( m , 3) to node ( m , n \u2212 2). We can obtain a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these four paths by adding four edges \u3008(1, 2), (1, 3)\u3009, \u3008(1, n \u2212 2), (1, n \u2212 1)\u3009, \u3008( m , 2), ( m , 3)\u3009, \u3008( m , n \u2212 2), ( m , n \u2212 1)\u3009. Fig. 3.3 (b) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (7, 8)) \u2212 {(1, 1), (7,8)}. \u25a1 Lemma\u00a03.4 Let m \u2a7e 4 and n \u2a7e 4 be a pair of even numbers. Let P(p 1 , p 2 ), and Q(q 1 , q 2 ) be a pair of nodes of M((1, 1), (m, n)) such that 2 \u2a7d p 1 \u2a7d q 1 \u2a7d m \u2212 1, 2 \u2a7d p 2 \u2a7d q 2 \u2a7d n \u2212 1, q 2 \u2212 p 2 is odd. Let G = M((1, 1), (m, n)) \u2212 M(P, Q). Then G admits a Hamiltonian cycle. Proof Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), ( m , p 2 \u2212 1)), G 2 = M ((1, q 2 + 1), ( m , n )), G 3 = M ((1, p 2 ), ( p 1 \u2212 1, q 2 )), G 4 = M (( q 1 + 1, p 2 ),( m , q 2 )). From Lemma 3.1 , G 1 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, p 2 \u2212 1) to node ( m , p 2 \u2212 1), G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, q 2 + 1) to node ( m , q 2 + 1), G 3 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, p 2 ) to node (1, q 2 ), G 4 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node ( m , p 2 ) to node ( m , q 2 ). We then obtain a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these four paths by adding four edges \u3008(1, p 2 \u2212 1), (1, p 2 )\u3009, \u3008(1, q 2 ), (1, q 2 + 1)\u3009, \u3008( m , p 2 \u2212 1), ( m , p 2 )\u3009, \u3008( m , q 2 ), ( m , q 2 + 1)\u3009. Fig. 3.4 shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (10, 10)) \u2212 {(3, 2), (7, 7)}. \u25a1 Lemma\u00a03.5 Let m \u2a7e 4 and n \u2a7e 2 be a pair of even numbers. Let P = (1, 1) and Q = (q, n) be a pair of nodes of M((1, 1), (m, n)), where q is odd. Let G = M((1, 1), (m, n)) \u2212 { P, Q } . Then G admits a Hamiltonian path from node (1, n) to node (m, n). Proof The affirmation is obvious for the case where n = 2. Fig. 3.5 (a) gives such a Hamiltonian path of M ((1, 1), (8, 2)) \u2212 {(1, 1), (5, 2)}. We now assume n \u2a7e 4. Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), ( q \u2212 1, 2)) \u2212 P , G 2 = M (( q , n \u2212 1), ( m , n )) \u2212 Q , G 3 = M ((1, 3), ( q \u2212 1, n )), G 4 = M (( q , 1),( m , n \u2212 2)). Clearly, G 1 has a unique Hamiltonian path from node (1, 2) to node ( q \u2212 1, 1), G 2 has a unique Hamiltonian path from node ( q , n \u2212 1) to node ( m , n ). From Lemma 3.1 , G 3 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, 3) to node (1, n ), G 4 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node ( q , 1) to node ( q , n \u2212 2). From these four paths and by adding three edges \u3008(1, 2), (1, 3)\u3009, \u3008( q \u2212 1, 1), ( q , 1)\u3009, \u3008( q , n \u2212 2), ( q , n \u2212 1)\u3009, we get a Hamiltonian path of G from node (1, n ) to node ( m , n ). Fig. 3.5 (b) shows such a Hamiltonian path of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(1, 1), (5, 8)}. \u25a1 Lemma\u00a03.6 Let n \u2a7e 4 be an even number. Let P = (2, p) and Q = (3, q) be a pair of nodes of M((1, 1), (4, n)), where 2 \u2a7d p < q \u2a7d n \u2212 1, q \u2212 p is even. Let G = M((1, 1), (4, n)) \u2212 { P, Q } . Then G admits a Hamiltonian cycle. Proof We may assume p is odd; otherwise we can rotate the mesh by 180\u00b0 and view Q as P instead. Let G 1 = M ((1, p ), (2, n )) \u2212 P , G 2 = M ((3, p ), (4, n )) \u2212 Q , G 3 = ((1, 1), (4, p \u2212 1)). Clearly, G 1 has a unique Hamiltonian path from node (1, p ) to node (2, n ), G 2 has a unique Hamiltonian path from node (4, p ) to node (3, n ), G 3 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, p \u2212 1) to node (4, p \u2212 1). We obtain a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these three paths by adding three edges \u3008(1, p \u2212 1), (1, p )\u3009, \u3008(4, p \u2212 1), (4, p )\u3009, \u3008(2, n ), (3, n )\u3009. Fig. 3.6 gives such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (4, 10)) \u2212 {(2, 3), (3, 7)}. \u25a1 Lemma\u00a03.7 Let n \u2a7e 4 be an even integer. Let P = (3, p) and Q = (4, q) be a pair of nodes of M((1, 1), (4, n)), where 2 \u2a7d p < q \u2a7d n \u2212 2, q \u2212 p is even. Let G = M((1, 1), (4, n)) \u2212 { P, Q } . Then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. Proof Let G 1 = M ((3, p ), (4, q + 1)) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, p ), (2, q + 1)), G 3 = ((1, 1), (4, p \u2212 1)), G 4 = ((1, q + 2), (4, n )). Clearly, G 1 possesses a unique Hamiltonian path from node (4, p ) to node (4, q + 1), G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, p ) to node (1, q + 1), G 3 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, p \u2212 1) to node (4, p \u2212 1), G 4 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, q + 2) to node (4, q + 2). We have a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these four paths by adding four edges \u3008(1, p \u2212 1), (1, p )\u3009, \u3008(4, p \u2212 1), (4, p )\u3009, \u3008(1, q + 1), (1, q + 2)\u3009, \u3008(4, q + 1), (4, q + 2)\u3009. Fig. 3.7 shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (4, 10)) \u2212 {(3, 3), (4, 7)}. \u25a1 Lemma\u00a03.8 Let m \u2a7e 3 be an integer, n \u2a7e 4 be an even number. Let G = M((1, 1), (m, n)) \u2212 { (1, 1), (1, n) } . Then G admits a Hamiltonian cycle. Proof Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), (2, n )) \u2212 {(1, 1), (1, n )}, G 2 = M ((3, 1), ( m , n )). Clearly, G 1 has a unique Hamiltonian path from node (2, 1) to node (2, n ), G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (3, 1) to node (3, n ). From these two paths and by adding two edges \u3008(2, 1), (3, 1)\u3009 and \u3008(2, n ), (3, n )\u3009, we obtain a Hamiltonian cycle of G . Fig. 3.8 gives such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (5, 6)) \u2212 {(1, 1), (1, 6)}. \u25a1 Lemma\u00a03.9 Let n \u2a7e 4 be an even number. Let P = (2, p) and Q = (2, q) be a pair of nodes of M((1, 1), (4, n)), where 2 \u2a7d p < q \u2a7d n \u2212 1, q \u2212 p is odd. Let G = M((1, 1), (4, n)) \u2212 { P, Q } . Then G admits a Hamiltonian cycle. Proof Let G 1 = M ((1, p ), (2, q )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((3, p ), (4, q )), G 3 = M ((1, 1), (4, p \u2212 1)), G 4 = M ((1, q + 1), (4, n )). Clearly, G 1 possesses a unique Hamiltonian path from node (1, p ) to node (1, q ), G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (4, p ) to node (4, q ), G 3 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, p \u2212 1) to node (4, p \u2212 1), G 4 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, q + 1) to node (4, q + 1). A Hamiltonian cycle of G is formed from these four paths by adding four edges \u3008(1, p \u2212 1), (1, p )\u3009, \u3008(4, p \u2212 1), (4, p )\u3009, \u3008(1, q ), (1, q + 1)\u3009, \u3008(4, q ), (4, q + 1)\u3009. Fig. 3.9 gives such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (4, 10)) \u2212 {(2, 2), (2, 7)}. \u25a1 4 Main result The main result of this paper is formulated below. Theorem\u00a04.1 Let m \u2a7e 4 and n \u2a7e 4 be a pair of even numbers. Let P and Q be a pair of nodes of the mesh M((1, 1), (m, n)). Let U 0 = { (i, j) : 1 \u2a7d i \u2a7d m, 1 \u2a7d j \u2a7d n, i + j is even } , U 1 = { (i, j) : 1 \u2a7d i \u2a7d m, 1 \u2a7d j \u2a7d n, i + j is odd } . Then the faulty mesh M((1, 1), (m, n)) \u2212 { P, Q } does not admit a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if either of the following two conditions is satisfied: ( C 1) Either both P and Q belong to U 0 , or both belong to U 1 . ( C 2) One of P and Q is next to some corner node of the original mesh, but the other is not this corner node. Proof If either of the two conditions is satisfied, the nonexistence of a Hamiltonian cycle of the faulty mesh is obvious. We now assume neither of these two conditions holds. It suffices to build a Hamiltonian cycle of the faulty mesh. To this end, let P = ( p 1 , p 2 ) and Q = ( q 1 , q 2 ). Then p 1 + p 2 is different from q 1 + q 2 in parity. In view of the symmetry of 2D meshes, we may assume p 1 \u2a7d q 1 , p 2 \u2a7d q 2 , q 1 \u2212 p 1 is even, q 2 \u2212 p 2 is odd. Let G = M ((1, 1), ( m , n )) \u2212 { P , Q }. We consider the following three possible positional relationships of P and Q . Case 1 : q 1 \u2a7e p 1 + 2, q 2 \u2a7e p 2 + 3. Case 2 : q 1 \u2a7e p 1 + 2, q 2 = p 2 + 1. Case 3 : q 1 = p 1 . Next, these three possibilities are treated, respectively. Case 1 : q 1 \u2a7e p 1 + 2, q 2 \u2a7e p 2 + 3. Then P cannot lie on the bottom or right border of the original mesh, Q cannot lie on the top or left border of the original mesh. Subcase 1.1 . Neither P nor Q lies on the border of the mesh. That is, p 1 \u2a7e 2, p 2 \u2a7e 2, q 1 \u2a7d m \u2212 1, q 2 \u2a7d n \u2212 1. Let G 1 = M ( P , Q ) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, 1), ( m , n )) \u2212 M ( P , Q ). Let e 1 = \u3008( p 1 , q 2 \u2212 1), ( p 1 , q 2 )\u3009, e 2 = \u3008( p 1 \u2212 1, q 2 \u2212 1), ( p 1 \u2212 1, q 2 )\u3009. From Lemma 3.3 , G 1 has a Hamiltonian cycle, which traverses edge e 1 . From Lemma 3.4 , G 2 has a Hamiltonian cycle, which traverses edge e 2 . Thus, a Hamiltonian cycle of G can be obtained from these two cycles by removing two edges e 1 , e 2 , and adding two edges \u3008( p 1 \u2212 1, q 2 \u2212 1), ( p 1 , q 2 \u2212 1)\u3009, \u3008( p 1 \u2212 1, q 2 ), ( p 1 , q 2 )\u3009. Fig. 4.1 (a) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (10, 10)) \u2212 {(3, 3), (7, 8)}. Subcase 1.2 . P is the top-left corner node of the original mesh. (The argument for the case where Q lies on the bottom-right corner of the original mesh is similar.) Subcase 1.2.1 . Q is on the right border of the original mesh. Clearly, q 1 \u2a7d m \u2212 2. Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), ( q 1 , n )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M (( q 1 + 1, 1), ( m , n )). Let e 1 = \u3008( q 1 , 1), ( q 1 , 2)\u3009, e 2 = \u3008( q 1 + 1, 1), ( q 1 + 1, 2)\u3009. From Lemma 3.3 , G 1 contains a Hamiltonian cycle, which traverses e 1 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( q 1 + 1)th row as reference, which traverses e 2 . We then have a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these two cycles by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding two edges \u3008( q 1 , 1), ( q 1 + 1, 1)\u3009, \u3008( q 1 , 2), ( q 1 + 1, 2)\u3009. Fig. 4.1 (b) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(1, 1), (5, 8)}. Subcase 1.2.2 . Q is not on the right border of the original mesh. Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), ( m , q 2 )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, q 2 + 1), ( m , n )). According to Lemma 3.5 , G 1 has a Hamiltonian path from node (1, q 2 ) to node ( m , q 2 ). From Lemma 3.1 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, q 2 + 1) to node ( m , q 2 + 1). From these two paths and by adding two edges \u3008(1, q 2 ), (1, q 2 + 1)\u3009 and \u3008( m , q 2 ), ( m , q 2 + 1)\u3009, we get a Hamiltonian cycle of G . Fig. 4.1 (c) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(1, 1), (5, 6)}. Subcase 1.3 . P is on the top border of the original mesh but is not the top-left corner node. (The argument for the case where Q is on the bottom border of the mesh but is not the bottom-right corner node is similar.) Clearly, p 2 \u2a7e 3. Let G 1 = M ((1, p 2 ), ( m , n )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, 1), ( m , p 2 \u2212 1)). Let e 1 = \u3008(2, p 2 ), (3, p 2 )\u3009, e 2 = \u3008(2, p 2 \u2212 1), (3, p 2 \u2212 1)\u3009. Similarly to Subcase 1.2, we can build a Hamiltonian cycle of G 1 , which traverses edge e 1 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( p 2 \u2212 1)th column as reference, which traverses edge e 2 . Thus, we can construct a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these two cycles by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding two edges \u3008(2, p 2 \u2212 1), (2, p 2 )\u3009 and \u3008(3, p 2 \u2212 1), (3, p 2 )\u3009. Fig. 4.1 (d) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(1, 4), (5, 7)}. Subcase 1.4 . P is on the left border of the original mesh but is not the top-left corner node. (The argument for the case where Q lies on the right border of the mesh but is not the bottom-right corner node is similar.) Clearly, p 1 \u2a7e 3. If Q is on the bottom border of the original mesh, the argument will be analogous to Case 1.3. We now assume Q is not on the bottom border of the original mesh. Then there are two possibilities. Subcase 1.4.1 . q 1 is odd. Let G 1 = M (( p 1 , 1), ( m , n )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, 1), ( p 1 \u2212 1, n )). Let e 1 = \u3008( p 1 , 2), ( p 1 , 3)\u3009, e 2 = \u3008( p 1 \u2212 1, 2), ( p 1 \u2212 1, 3)\u3009. Similarly to Subcase 1.2, we can build a Hamiltonian cycle of G 1 , which traverses edge e 1 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( p 1 \u2212 1)th row as reference, which traverses edge e 2 . We obtain a Hamiltonian cycle of G from the two cycles by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding two edges \u3008( p 1 \u2212 1, 2), ( p 1 , 2)\u3009, \u3008( p 1 \u2212 1, 3), ( p 1 , 3)\u3009. Fig. 4.1 (e) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(3, 1), (5, 6)}. Subcase 1.4.2 . q 1 is even. Then q 1 \u2a7d m \u2212 2. We proceed by further considering two possible cases. Subcase 1.4.2.1 . Q is on the right border of the original mesh. Let G 1 = M (( p 1 , 1), ( q 1 , n )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, 1), ( p 1 \u2212 1, n )), G 3 = M (( q 1 + 1, 1), ( m , n )). Let e 1 = \u3008( p 1 , 2), ( p 1 , 3)\u3009, e 2 = \u3008( q 1 , 1), ( q 1 , 2)\u3009, e 3 = \u3008( p 1 \u2212 1, 2), ( p 1 \u2212 1, 3)\u3009, e 4 = \u3008( q 1 + 1, 1), ( q 1 + 1, 2)\u3009. From Lemma 3.3 , G 1 admits a Hamiltonian cycle, which traverses edges e 1 and e 2 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( p 1 \u2212 1)th row as reference, which traverses edge e 3 ; G 3 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( q 1 + 1)th row as reference, which traverses edge e 4 . We obtain a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these three cycles by removing four edges e i (1 \u2a7d i \u2a7d 4) and adding four edges \u3008( p 1 \u2212 1, 2), ( p 1 , 2)\u3009, \u3008( p 1 \u2212 1, 3), ( p 1 , 3)\u3009, \u3008( q 1 , 1), ( q 1 + 1, 1)\u3009, \u3008( q 1 , 2), ( q 1 + 1, 2)\u3009. Fig. 4.1 (f) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(4, 1), (6, 8)}. Subcase 1.4.2.2 . Q is not on the right border of the original mesh. Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), ( m , q 2 )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, q 2 + 1), ( m , n )). Let e 1 = \u3008(1, q 2 ), (2, q 2 )\u3009, e 2 = \u3008(1, q 2 + 1), (2, q 2 + 1)\u3009. Similarly to Subcase 1.4.2.1, we can build a Hamiltonian cycle of G 1 , which traverses edge e 1 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( q 2 + 1)th column as reference, which traverses edge e 2 . We obtain a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these two cycles by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding two edges \u3008(1, q 2 ), (1, q 2 + 1)\u3009 and \u3008(2, q 2 ), (2, q 2 + 1)\u3009. Fig. 4.1 (g) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(4, 1), (6, 6)}. Case 2 : q 1 \u2a7e p 1 + 2, q 2 = p 2 + 1. Without loss of generality, we assume p 1 is odd; otherwise we can rotate the mesh by 180\u00b0 and view Q as P . Next, we examine three possibilities. Subcase 2.1 . p 2 = 1. Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), ( m , 2)), G 2 = M ((1, 3), ( m , n )). Clearly, G 1 has a unique Hamiltonian path from node (1, 2) to node ( m , 2). From Lemma 3.1 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from node (1, 3) to node ( m , 3). We obtain a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these two paths by adding two edges \u3008(1, 2), (1, 3)\u3009, \u3008( m , 2), ( m , 3)\u3009. Fig. 4.2 (a) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(3, 1), (5, 2)}. Subcase 2.2 . p 2 = 2. Then p 1 \u2260 1. When n = 4, it follows from Lemma 3.6 that G has a Hamiltonian cycle. We now assume n \u2a7e 6. Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), ( m , 4)) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = ((1, 5), ( m , n )). Let e 1 = \u3008(1, 4), (2, 4)\u3009, e 2 = \u3008(1, 5), (2, 5)\u3009. From Lemma 3.6 , G 1 has a Hamiltonian cycle, which traverses edge e 1 . According to Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the fifth column as reference, which traverses edge e 2 . We get a Hamiltonian cycle of G from the two cycles by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding two edges \u3008(1, 4), (1, 5)\u3009, \u3008(2, 4), (2, 5)\u3009. Fig. 4.2 (b) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(3, 2), (5, 3)}. Subcase 2.3. p 2 \u2a7e 3. If n = 4, it follows from Lemma 3.7 that G admits a Hamiltonian cycle. Next, we assume n \u2a7e 6. Subcase 2.3.1 . q 2 = n . Then p 2 = n \u2212 1. Let G 1 = M ((1, n \u2212 3), ( m , n )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, 1), ( m , n \u2212 4)). Let e 1 = \u3008(1, n \u2212 3), (2, n \u2212 3)\u3009, e 2 = \u3008(1, n \u2212 4), (2, n \u2212 4)\u3009. According to Lemma 3.7 , G 1 has a Hamiltonian cycle, which traverses edge e 1 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( n \u2212 4)th column as reference, which traverses edge e 2 . We get a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these two cycles by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding two edges \u3008(1, n \u2212 4), (1, n \u2212 3)\u3009, \u3008(2, n \u2212 4), (2, n \u2212 3)\u3009. Fig. 4.2 (c) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1),(8, 8)) \u2212 {(3, 7),(5, 8)}. Subcase 2.3.2 . q 2 \u2a7d n \u2212 1. Let G 1 = M ((1, p 2 ), ( m , n )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, 1), ( m , p 2 \u2212 1)). Let e 1 = \u3008( p 1 + 1, p 2 ), ( p 1 + 2, p 2 )\u3009, e 2 = \u3008( p 1 + 1, p 2 \u2212 1), ( p 1 + 2, p 2 \u2212 1)\u3009. Similarly to Subcase 2.1, G 1 has a Hamiltonian cycle, which traverses edge e 1 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( p 2 \u2212 1)th column as reference, which traverses edge e 2 . We can form a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these two cycles by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding two edges \u3008( p 1 + 1, p 2 \u2212 1), ( p 1 + 1, p 2 )\u3009, \u3008( p 1 + 2, p 2 \u2212 1), ( p 1 + 2, p 2 )\u3009. Fig. 4.2 (d) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(3, 3), (5, 4)}. Case 3 : q 1 = p 1 . Next we consider the value of p 1 . Subcase 3.1 . p 1 = 1. (The case where p 1 = m can be discussed similarly.) When q 1 = 1, q 2 = n , it follows from Lemma 3.8 that G has a Hamiltonian cycle. So there remain three subcases. Subcase 3.1.1 . p 2 = 1, q 2 \u2a7d n \u2212 2. Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), ( m , q 2 )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, q 2 + 1), ( m , n )). Let e 1 = \u3008(2, q 2 ), (3, q 2 )\u3009, e 2 = \u3008(2, q 2 + 1), (3, q 2 + 1)\u3009. From Lemma 3.8 , G 1 has a Hamiltonian cycle, which traverses edge e 1 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( q 2 + 1)th column as reference, which traverses edge e 2 . From these two cycles by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding two edges \u3008(2, q 2 ), (2, q 2 + 1)\u3009 and \u3008(3, q 2 ), (3, q 2 + 1)\u3009, we obtain a Hamiltonian cycle of G . Fig. 4.3 (a) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(1, 1), (1, 4)}. Subcase 3.1.2 . p 2 \u2a7e 3, q 2 = n . The argument is analogous to Subcase 3.1.1. Subcase 3.1.3. p 2 \u2a7e 3, q 2 \u2a7d n \u2212 2. Let G 1 = M ((1, p 2 ), ( m , n )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, 1), ( m , p 2 \u2212 1)). Let e 1 = \u3008(2, p 2 ), (3, p 2 )\u3009, e 2 = \u3008(2, p 2 \u2212 1), (3, p 2 \u2212 1)\u3009. Similarly to Subcase 3.1.1, G 1 has a Hamiltonian cycle, which traverses edge e 1 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( p 1 \u2212 1)th column as reference, which traverses edge e 2 . From these two cycles by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding two edges \u3008(2, p 2 \u2212 1), (2, p 2 )\u3009 and \u3008(3, p 2 \u2212 1), (3, p 2 )\u3009, we form a Hamiltonian cycle of G . Fig. 4.3 (b) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(1, 3), (1, 6)}. Subcase 3.2 . p 1 = 2. (The argument for the case where p 1 = m \u2212 1 is similar.) When m = 4, it follows from Lemma 3.9 that G admits a Hamiltonian cycle. Now assume m \u2a7e 6. Let G 1 = M ((1, 1), (4, n )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((5, 1), ( m , n )). Let e 1 = \u3008(4, 1), (4, 2)\u3009, e 2 = \u3008(5, 1), (5, 2)\u3009. According to Lemma 3.9 , G 1 admits a Hamiltonian cycle, which traverses edge e 1 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the fifth row as reference, which traverses e 2 . From the two cycles by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding two edges \u3008(4, 1), (5, 1)\u3009 and \u3008(4, 2), (5, 2)\u3009, we get a Hamiltonian cycle of G . Fig. 4.3 (c) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(2, 3), (2, 6)}. Subcase 3.3. 3 \u2a7d p 1 \u2a7d m \u2212 2. Subcase 3.3.1 . p 2 \u2260 2, q 2 \u2260 n \u2212 1. Let G 1 = M (( p 1 , 1), ( m , n )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, 1), ( p 1 \u2212 1, n )). Similarly to Subcase 3.1, G 1 has a Hamiltonian cycle. From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( p 1 \u2212 1)th row as reference. We can get a Hamiltonian cycle of G from the two cycles by removing two edges and adding two new edges. Fig. 4.3 (d) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(3, 3), (3, 6)}. Subcase 3.3.2 . p 2 = 2. Then q 2 \u2260 n . We may assume p 1 \u2a7e 4 (otherwise we can rotate the mesh by 180\u00b0). Let G 1 = M (( p 1 \u2212 1, 1), ( p 1 , n )) \u2212 { P , Q }, G 2 = M ((1, 1), ( p 1 \u2212 2, n )), G 3 = M (( p 1 + 1, 1), ( m , n )). Let e 1 = \u3008( p 1 \u2212 1, 1), ( p 1 \u2212 1, 2)\u3009, e 2 = \u3008( p 1 \u2212 2, 1), ( p 1 \u2212 2, 2)\u3009. Clearly, G 1 has a Hamiltonian path from ( p 1 , 1) to ( p 1 , n ), which traverses edge e 1 . From Lemma 3.2 , G 2 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian cycle with the ( p 1 \u2212 2)th row as reference, which traverses edge e 2 . From Lemma 3.1 , G 3 has a ladder-shape Hamiltonian path from ( p 1 + 1, 1) to ( p 1 + 1, n ). We can form a Hamiltonian cycle of G from these two paths and this cycle by removing two edges e 1 and e 2 and adding four edges \u3008( p 1 \u2212 2, 1), ( p 1 \u2212 1, 1)\u3009, \u3008( p 1 \u2212 2, 2), ( p 1 \u2212 1, 2)\u3009, \u3008( p 1 , 1), ( p 1 + 1, 1)\u3009, \u3008( p 1 , n ), ( p 1 + 1, n )\u3009. Fig. 4.3 (e) shows such a Hamiltonian cycle of M ((1, 1), (8, 8)) \u2212 {(4, 2), (4, 5)}. Subcase 3.3.3 . q 2 = n \u2212 1. The argument is similar to Subcase 3.3.2. The proof has been completed. \u25a1 Remark The proof of Theorem 4.1 provides an efficient scheme for constructing a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle in a faulty m \u00d7 n mesh ( m \u2a7e 4 and n \u2a7e 4 are even), if there is. As a byproduct of Theorem 4.1 , we have Theorem\u00a04.2 Let m \u2a7e 4 and n \u2a7e 4 be a pair of even numbers. Let P and Q be a pair of faulty nodes within the torus T((1, 1), (m, n)). Then the faulty torus T((1, 1), (m, n)) \u2212 { P, Q } admits a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle if and only if exactly one node in {P, Q } falls into U 0 . 5 Concluding remarks This paper deals with the Hamiltonian properties of faulty meshes. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a Hamiltonian m \u00d7 n mesh ( m \u2a7e 4 and n \u2a7e 4 are even) at the presence of two faulty nodes. Our conclusion generalizes a result owing to Kim and Yoon [7] . The Hamiltonian properties of faulty meshes need further investigation. It is worthwhile to determine Hamiltonian meshes in the presence of more than two faulty nodes. The work of this paper should be extended to the situation of higher-dimensional meshes.

The algorithm is based on the PMC model and can isolate all faulty processors to within a set that contains at most one fault-free processor.

        "abstract": "The dominating majority of previous computer virus epidemic models assume a bilinear infection rate. This assumption, however, ignores the fact that, due to reasons such as overcrowded infected nodes and active protection measures taken at a high level of viral prevalence, the infection rate typically rises in a nonlinear fashion. This paper is devoted to understanding the impact of nonlinear infection rate on the propagation of computer infections. For that purpose, a new computer virus epidemic model is proposed by introducing a generic nonlinear infection rate into a traditional SLBS model. Theoretical analysis shows that, under moderate conditions, the proposed model admits a (viral) globally asymptotically stable equilibrium, fully demonstrating the robustness of stability of the equilibrium to the details of infections. The new model is justified through simulation experiments. We also determine the influence of some model parameters on the viral equilibrium. Our results extend some previously known results.",

The ultimate objective of our work, which is based on mathematical modeling and is verified by computer simulation, is to explore behavior characteristics of computer viruses during their propagation. We find that, without considering super-infection, the process of virus evolution tends to maximize the basic reproductive ratio. After taking super-infection into account, we analyzed the special case and the general case respectively and formulated the equilibrium solutions of the virulence model under certain assumptions. The two virulence models indicate some inherent features presented by computer viruses, instead of infected computers in the network, which is original to our knowledge.

This paper addresses the APT defense problem, that is, the problem of how to effectively defend against an APT campaign. Based on a novel APT attack-defense model, the effectiveness of an APT defense strategy is quantified. Thereby, the APT defense problem is modeled as an optimal control problem, in which an optimal control stands for a most effective APT defense strategy. The existence of an optimal control is proved, and an optimality system is derived. Consequently, an optimal control can be figured out by solving the optimality system. Some examples of the optimal control are given. Finally, the influence of some factors on the effectiveness of an optimal control is examined through computer experiments. These findings help organizations to work out policies of defending against APTs.",

We prove that an HHM of order t\u22653 admits a cycle of length l for each even number l such that l=6 or 10\u2264l\u22646t2-2. We also describe a systematic method for building these cycles.",

        "abstract": "Due to the high dimensionality of an epidemic model of computer viruses over a general scale-free network, it is difficult to make a close study of its dynamics. In particular, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prove the global stability of its viral equilibrium, if any. To overcome this difficulty, we suggest to simplify a general scale-free network by partitioning all of its nodes into two classes: higher-degree nodes and lower-degree nodes, and then equating the degrees of all higher-degree nodes and all lower-degree nodes, respectively, yielding a reduced scale-free network. We then propose an epidemic model of computer viruses over a reduced scale-free network. A theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed model is bound to have a globally stable viral equilibrium, implying that any attempt to eradicate network viruses would prove unavailing. As a result, the next best thing we can do is to restrain virus prevalence. Based on an analysis of the impact of different model parameters on virus prevalence, some practicable measures are recommended to contain virus spreading. The work in this paper adequately justifies the idea of reduced scale-free networks. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

By incorporating a vaccination probability in the SIRS model with generalized nonlinear incidence rate, a novel epidemic model of computer viruses is established. A thorough analysis of this model shows that, depending on the value of the basic reproduction number, either the virus-free equilibrium or the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Simulation results not only justify the proposed model, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination. Based on a parameter analysis for the model, some effective strategies for inhibiting the virus prevalence are posed.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism of the catalytic oxidation of water by cis,cis-[(bpy)(2)Ru(OH(2))](2)O(4+) to give molecular dioxygen was investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT). A series of four oxidation and four deprotonation events generate the catalytically competent species cis,cis-[(bpy)(2)Ru(V)O](2)O(4+), which breaks the H-OH bond homolytically at the rate determining transition state to give a hydroperoxo intermediate. Our calculations predict a rate determining activation barrier of 25.9 kcal/mol in solution phase, which is in reasonable agreement with the previously reported experimental estimate of 18.7-23.3 kcal/mol. A number of plausible coupling schemes of the two metal sites including strong coupling, weak ferromagnetic and weak antiferromagnetic coupling have been considered. In addition, both high-spin and low-spin states at each of the Ru(V)-d(3) centers were explored and we found that the high-spin states play an important mechanistic role. Our calculations suggest that cis,cis-[(bpy)(2)Ru(V)O](2)O(4+) performs formally an intramolecular ligand-to-metal charge transfer when reacting with water to formally give a cis,cis-[(bpy)(2)Ru(IV)O*](2)O(4+) complex. We propose that the key characteristic of the diruthenium catalyst that allows it to accomplish the most difficult first two oxidations of the overall four-electron redox reaction is directly associated with this in situ generation of two radicaloid oxo moieties that promote the water splitting reaction. A proton coupled metal-to-metal charge transfer follows to yield a Ru(V)/Ru(III) peroxo/aqua mixed valence complex, which performs the third redox reaction to give the superoxo/aqua complex. Finally, intersystem crossing to a ferromagnetically coupled Ru(IV)/Ru(III) superoxo/aqua species is predicted, which will then promote the last redox event to release triplet dioxygen as the final product. A number of key features of the computed mechanism are explored in detail to derive a conceptual understanding of the catalytic mechanism.",

The qualitative properties of this model are fully studied. First, the basic reproduction number, R0, for this model is determined. Second, by introducing appropriate Lyapunov functions, it is proved that the virus-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R0\u22641, whereas the viral equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if 1< R0\u22644. Next, the sensitivity analysis of R0 to three system parameters is conducted, and the dependence of R0 on the remaining system parameters is investigated. On this basis, a set of policies is recommended for eradicating viruses spreading across the Internet effectively. \u00a9 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

This paper addresses the issue of maximizing the overall profit of a WOM marketing campaign. A marketing process with both positive and negative WOM is modeled as a dynamical model knwn as the SIPNS model, and the profit maximization problem is modeled as a constrained optimization problem. The influence of different factors on the dynamics of the SIPNS model is revealed experimentally. Also, the impact of different factors on the expected overall profit of a WOM marketing campaign is uncovered experimentally. On this basis, some promotion strategies are suggested. To our knowledge, this is the first time a WOM marketing campaign is treated this way.",

However, nearly all previous epidemiological models of viruses considered only the Internet route of spread of viruses, neglecting the removable device route at all. In this paper, a new spread model of viruses, which incorporates the effect of removable devices, is suggested. Different from previous models, the epidemic threshold for this model vanishes. Moreover, the model admits a unique virose equilibrium, which is shown to be globally asymptotically stable. This result implies that any effort in eradicating viruses cannot succeed. By analyzing the respective influences of system parameters, a number of policies are recommended so as to restrict the density of infected computers to below an acceptable threshold. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.

One striking advantage of our method is that the differential operator, boundary conditions and numerical fluxes involved in the elementwise computation can be done with lower time cost. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of this method. Furthermore, this paper generalizes the DLWE method to the general elliptic equations defined on a bounded domain and describes the possibilities of constructing optimal adaptive algorithm. The proposed method and its generalizations are also applicable to some other kinds of partial differential equations. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "An interconnection network with n nodes is four-pancyclic if it contains a cycle of length l for each integer l with 4\u2264 l \u2264 n . An interconnection network is fault-tolerant four-pancyclic if the surviving network is four-pancyclic in the presence of faults. The fault-tolerant four-pancyclicity of interconnection networks is a desired property because many classical parallel algorithms can be mapped onto such networks in a communication-efficient fashion, even in the presence of failing nodes or edges. Due to some attractive properties as compared with its hypercube counterpart of the same size, the M\u00f6bius cube has been proposed as a promising candidate for interconnection topology. Hsieh and Chen [S.Y. Hsieh, C.H. Chen, Pancyclicity on M\u00f6bius cubes with maximal edge faults, Parallel Computing, 30(3) (2004) 407\u2013421.] showed that an n -dimensional M\u00f6bius cube is four-pancyclic in the presence of up to n \u22122 faulty edges. In this paper, we show that an n -dimensional M\u00f6bius cube is four-pancyclic in the presence of up to n -2 faulty nodes. The obtained result is optimal in that, if n \u22121 nodes are removed, the surviving network may not be four-pancyclic.",

However, how to study these components? This paper addresses the construction of morphological wavelets by combining wavelet with mathematical morphology. First, the multidimensional multi-channel lifting scheme, a general framework of multidimensional morphological wavelet construction, is presented. Then one-dimensional and multi-dimensional multi-channel median morphological wavelets are constructed with median operator.",

According to the difference of sex conception in western and oriental nations, we construct the Barabsi Albert-Barabsi Albert (BA-BA) model and Barabsi-Albert Homogeneity (BA-HO) model for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Applying the rate equation approach, the positive equilibria of both models are given analytically. We find that the ratio between infected females and infected males is distinctly different in both models and the infected density in the BA-HO model is much less than that in the BA-BA model. These results explain that the countries with small ratio have less infected density than those with large ratio. Our numerical simulations verify these theoretical results. \u00a9 2009 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In order to make a full evaluation of an interconnection network, it is essential to estimate the minimum size of a largest connected component of this network provided the faulty vertices in the network may break its connectedness. Star graphs are recognized as promising candidates for interconnection networks. This article addresses the size of a largest connected component of a faulty star graph. We prove that, in an n-star graph (n\u22653) with up to 2n-4 faulty vertices, all fault-free vertices but at most two form a connected component. Moreover, all fault-free vertices but exactly two form a connected component if and only if the set of all faulty vertices is equal to the neighbourhood of a pair of fault-free adjacent vertices. These results show that star graphs exhibit excellent fault-tolerant abilities in the sense that there exists a large functional network in a faulty star graph.",

        "abstract": "All the known models describing the propagation of virus codes were based on the assumption that a computer is uninfected at the time it is being connected to the Internet. In reality, however, it is much likely that infected computers are connected to the Internet. This paper is intended to investigate the propagation behavior of virus programs provided infected computers are connected to the Internet with positive probability. For that purpose, a new model characterizing the spread of computer virus is proposed. Theoretical analysis of this model indicates that (1) there is a unique (viral) equilibrium, and (2) this equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Further study shows that, by taking active measures, the percentage of infected computers can be made below an acceptable threshold value. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lu-Xing Yang and Xiaofan Yang.",

The M\u00f6bius cube is a variant of the hypercube, which possesses some features desirable for parallel processing. This paper addresses the fault diagnosis of the M\u00f6bius cube under the MM* comparison model. By employing the distributed property of cycles over a M\u00f6bius cube, the authors present a new diagnosis algorithm. With elaborately organized data, this algorithm can operate in O(Nlog2 2 N) time, where N stands for the total number of nodes. In comparison, the classical Sengupta-Dahbura diagnosis algorithm takes as much as O(N5) time to achieve the same goal. As a consequence, the proposed algorithm is remarkably superior to the Sengupta-Dahbura algorithm in terms of the time overhead.",

Torus networks are a class of regular networks that have witnessed widespread applications. This paper addresses three subproblems of the OLR problem for torus networks, where two or three or four edges are removed. For either of the three subproblems, a link-removing scheme is described. Exhaustive searches show that, for small-sized tori, each of the proposed schemes produces an optimal solution to the corresponding subproblem. Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that, for medium-sized tori, each of the three schemes produces a solution to the corresponding subproblem, which is optimal when compared to a large set of randomly produced link-removing schemes. Consequently, it is speculated that each of the three schemes produces an optimal solution to the corresponding subproblem for all torus networks. The set of links produced by each of our schemes is evenly distributed over a network, which may be a common feature of an optimal solution to the OLR problem for regular networks.",

The influences of different model parameters as well as the network topology on virus spreading are also analyzed.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the behavior of the positive solutions of the system of two difference equations x n = A + 1 y n - p , y n = A + y n - 1 x n - r y n - s , n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , where p \u2a7e 1, r \u2a7e 1, s \u2a7e 1, A \u2a7e 0, and x 1\u2212 r , x 2\u2212 r , \u2026 , x 0 , y 1\u2212max{p, s } , y 2\u2212max{p, s } , \u2026 , y 0 are positive real numbers. Keywords Difference equation system Boundedness Periodicity Global asymptotic stability 1 Introduction Recently there has been a lot of work concerning the behavior of positive solutions of system of difference equations [1\u20138] . These researches are not only valuable in their own right, but they can provide insight into differential equation systems. In particular, Cinar [2] studied the periodicity of the positive solutions of the system of difference equations (1.1) x n = 1 y n - 1 , y n = y n - 1 x n - 2 y n - 2 , n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 On the other hand, Papaschinopolous and Schinas [6] and Yang [7] examined the dynamics of the following two difference equation systems, respectively. (1.2) x n = A + y n - 1 x n - p , y n = A + x n - 1 y n - q , n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , (1.3) x n = A + y n - 1 x n - p y n - q , y n = A + x n - 1 x n - r y n - s , n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 Motivated by the previous work, this paper addresses the system of rational difference equations (1.4) x n = A + 1 y n - p , y n = A + y n - 1 x n - r y n - s , n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , where p \u2a7e 1, r \u2a7e 1, s \u2a7e 1, A \u2a7e 0, and x 1\u2212 r , x 2\u2212 r , \u2026 , x 0 , y 1\u2212max{p, s } , y 2\u2212max{p, s } , \u2026 , y 0 are positive real numbers. Clearly, (1.4) includes (1.1) as special case. Obviously, system (1.4) has the unique positive equilibrium ( c , c ) = A + A 2 + 4 2 , A + A 2 + 4 2 for the case A > 0 and has an infinite number of positive equilibrium solutions ( x , y ) with x , y \u2208 (0, \u221e) that satisfy the equation xy = 1 for the case A = 0. The materials are organized in this fashion. Section 2 examines the boundedness of the positive solutions of (1.4) for the case A > 0. The periodic nature of the positive solutions of (1.4) for A = 0 is presented in Section 3 . Section 4 is focused on the global asymptotic behavior of all positive solutions of (1.4) for A > 0. 2 Boundedness This section is concerned with the boundedness of positive solutions to (1.4) in the case where A > 0. Theorem\u00a02.1 Let A > 0 and {(x n , y n ) } be a positive solution of ( 1.4 ) . Then the following three statements hold. (a) x n > A and y n > A for n \u2a7e 1. (b) x n < A + 1/A for n \u2a7e 2. (c) y n < \u2211 i = 0 s A - ( 2 i - 1 ) for n \u2a7e max{ r + s, 2s } . Proof Assertions (a) and (b) are obviously true. We now prove assertion (c). Inductively applying (1.4) , we obtain for n \u2a7e max{ r + s , 2 s } (2.1) y n = A + y n - 1 x n - r y n - s = A + A x n - r y n - s + y n - 2 x n - r x n - r - 1 y n - s y n - s - 1 = A + A x n - r y n - s + \u22ef + A x n - r x n - r - 1 \u22ef x n - r - s + 2 y n - s y n - s - 1 \u22ef y n - 2 s + 2 + 1 x n - r x n - r - 1 \u22ef x n - r - s + 1 y n - s - 1 \u22ef y n - 2 s + 1 . It follows from assertion (a) and (2.1) that (2.2) y n < A + 1 A + 1 A 3 + \u22ef + 1 A 2 s - 3 + 1 A 2 s - 1 = \u2211 i = 0 s A - ( 2 i - 1 ) . This implies the boundedness of the sequence { y n }. \u25a1 3 Periodicity When A = 0, System (1.4) reduces to (3.1) x n = 1 y n - p , y n = y n - 1 x n - r y n - s , n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 In this section, we will discuss the periodicity of (3.1) . Theorem\u00a03.1 Let {(x n , y n ) } be a positive solution of ( 3.1 ) . Then the following three statements hold. (a) When s = 1, all positive solutions of ( 3.1 ) are periodic with period (p + r). (b) When p + r = s > 1, all positive solutions of ( 3.1 ) are trivial solutions of the form (a, 1/a) for some a > 0. (c) When p + r \u2212 1 = s > 1, all positive solutions of ( 3.1 ) are periodic with period 2s. Proof (a) System (3.1) degenerates to x n = 1 y n - p , y n = 1 x n - r , n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , which imply x n + p + r = x n and y n + p + r = y n . (b) The assertion follows from the observations that y n + p + r = y n + p + r - 1 x n + p y n = y n + p + r - 1 , x n + p + r = 1 y n + r = 1 y n + r - 1 = x n + p + r - 1 . (c) From (3.1) we have x n + 2 s = 1 y n + 2 s - p = x n + 2 s - p - r y n + s - p y n + 2 s - p - 1 = x n + 2 s - p - r y n + s - p x n + 2 s - p - r - 1 y n + s - p - 1 y n + 2 s - p - 2 = y n + s - p x n + 2 s - p - r - 1 y n + 2 s - p - 2 . Working inductively, we get x n + 2 s = y n + s - p x n + 2 s - p - r - 1 y n + 2 s - p - 2 = y n + s - p x n + 2 s - p - r - 1 x n + 2 s - p - r - 2 y n + s - p - 2 y n + 2 s - p - 3 = y n + s - p x n + 2 s - p - r - 2 y n + 2 s - p - 3 = \u22ef = y n + s - p x n + s - p - r + 1 y n + s - p = x n . The proof is complete. \u25a1 Remark\u00a03.2 In particular, all positive solutions of system (3.1) with p = 1, r = 2 and s = 2 are periodic with period 4, this is proved in [2] . 4 Global attractivity In this section, we give some results about the stability of the positive solutions of (1.4) . Theorem\u00a04.1 Assume A > 2 / 3 and max{ p, r, s } \u2a7e 2. Then the positive equilibrium (c, c) of ( 1.4 ) is locally asymptotically stable. Proof Let M = max{ p , r , s }. System (1.4) can be formulated as the following system of first order recurrence equations: (4.1) w n ( 1 ) = x n - 1 , w n ( 2 ) = w n - 1 ( 1 ) , \u2026 , w n ( M - 1 ) = w n - 1 ( M - 2 ) , z n ( 1 ) = y n - 1 , z n ( 2 ) = z n - 1 ( 1 ) , \u2026 , z n ( M - 1 ) = z n - 1 ( M - 2 ) , x n = A + 1 z n - 1 ( p - 1 ) , y n = A + y n - 1 w n - 1 ( r - 1 ) z n - 1 ( s - 1 ) . Let v n = ( w n ( 1 ) , w n ( 2 ) , \u2026 , w n ( M - 1 ) , z n ( 1 ) , z n ( 2 ) , \u2026 , z n ( M - 1 ) , x n , y n ) T . Then the linearized system associated with (4.1) about the equilibrium ( c , c , \u2026 , c ) T is v n = \u03a6v n \u22121 , where \u03a6 = 1 2 3 \u22ee \u22ee M - 1 M M + 1 \u22ee \u22ee \u22ee 2 M - 2 2 M - 1 2 M 1 1 1 \u22f1 \u22f1 1 1 1 1 \u22f1 \u22f1 1 - c - 2 - c - 2 - c - 2 c - 2 , the \u2212 c 2 terms in the (2 M \u2212 1)st row of \u03a6 lie on the ( M \u2212 1 + p \u2212 1)st column; while the two \u2212 c 2 terms in the (2 M )th row lie on the ( r \u2212 1)st column and the ( M \u2212 1 + s \u2212 1)st column, respectively. Let P = diag( d 1 , d 2 , \u2026 , d 2 M ) be a diagonal matrix, where d 2 M \u22121 = d 2 M = 1, d k = d M \u22121+ k = 1 \u2212 k\u03b5 for each 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d M \u2212 1, and \u03b5 < min 1 M - 1 , c 2 - 3 ( M - 1 ) c 2 is a positive number. (Note that A > 2 / 3 implies c 2 > 3.) Simple calculations lead to P \u03a6 P - 1 = d 1 d 2 M - 1 - 1 d 2 d 1 - 1 d 3 d 2 - 1 \u22f1 \u22f1 d M - 1 d M - 2 - 1 d M d 2 M - 1 d M + 1 d M - 1 d M + 2 d M + 1 - 1 \u22f1 \u22f1 d 2 M - 2 d 2 M - 3 - 1 - d 2 M - 1 c - 2 d M + p - 2 - 1 - d 2 M c - 2 d r - 1 - 1 - d 2 M c - 2 d M + s - 2 - 1 d 2 M c - 2 d 2 M - 1 . The two chains of inequalities d 2 M - 1 > d 1 > d 2 > \u22ef > d M - 1 > 0 , d 2 M > d M > d M + 1 > \u22ef > d 2 M - 2 > 0 imply that d 1 d 2 M - 1 - 1 < 1 , d 2 d 1 - 1 < 1 , d 3 d 2 - 1 < 1 , \u2026 , d M - 1 d M - 2 - 1 < 1 , d M d 2 M - 1 < 1 , d M + 1 d M - 1 < 1 , d M + 2 d M + 1 - 1 < 1 , \u2026 , d 2 M - 2 d 2 M - 3 - 1 < 1 . Furthermore, d 2 M - 1 c - 2 d M + p - 2 - 1 = c - 2 1 1 - ( p - 1 ) \u03b5 < c - 2 1 1 - ( M - 1 ) \u03b5 < 1 , d 2 M c - 2 d r - 1 - 1 + d 2 M c - 2 d M + s - 2 - 1 + d 2 M c - 2 d 2 M - 1 = d 2 M c - 2 ( d r - 1 - 1 + d M + s - 2 - 1 + d 2 M - 1 ) = c - 2 1 1 - ( r - 1 ) \u03b5 + 1 1 - ( s - 1 ) \u03b5 + 1 < c - 2 3 1 - ( M - 1 ) \u03b5 < 1 . Let \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , \u2026 , \u03bb 2 M denote the 2 M eigenvalues of matrix \u03a6 . Since \u03a6 has the same set of eigenvalues as P\u03a6P \u22121 , we obtain max 1 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 2 M | \u03bb k | \u2a7d \u2016 P \u03a6 P - 1 \u2016 \u221e = max d 1 d 2 M - 1 - 1 , d M d 2 M - 1 , d 2 M - 1 c - 2 d M + p - 2 - 1 , d 2 M c - 2 ( d r - 1 - 1 + d M + s - 2 - 1 + d 2 M - 1 ) , max 2 \u2a7d k \u2a7d M - 1 { d k d k - 1 - 1 , d M + k - 1 d M + k - 2 - 1 } < 1 . So the equilibrium ( c , c , \u2026 , c ) T of (4.1) is locally asymptotically stable, which implies that the equilibrium ( c , c ) of (1.4) is locally asymptotically stable. \u25a1 Theorem\u00a04.2 Assume A > 2 . Then every positive solution of ( 1.4 ) converges to (c, c). Proof Let l 1 = lim n \u2192 \u221e inf { x n } , L 1 = lim n \u2192 \u221e sup { x n } , l 2 = lim n \u2192 \u221e inf { y n } , L 2 = lim n \u2192 \u221e sup { y n } . From Theorem 2.1 , we have 0 < A \u2a7d \u03bb 1 \u2a7d \u039b 1 < \u221e and 0 < A \u2a7d \u03bb 2 \u2a7d \u039b 2 < \u221e. This and (1.4) lead to (4.2) L 1 \u2a7d A + 1 l 2 , l 1 \u2a7e A + 1 L 2 , L 2 \u2a7d A + L 2 l 1 l 2 , l 2 \u2a7e A + l 2 L 1 L 2 , which can be written as L 1 L 2 l 2 \u2a7d AL 2 l 2 + L 2 , L 2 l 1 l 2 \u2a7e AL 2 l 2 + l 2 , L 2 l 1 l 2 \u2a7d Al 1 l 2 + L 2 , L 1 L 2 l 2 \u2a7e AL 1 L 2 + l 2 . Based on these relations, we derive AL 1 L 2 + l 2 \u2a7d AL 2 l 2 + L 2 and AL 2 l 2 + l 2 \u2a7d Al 1 l 2 + L 2 , which yield AL 1 L 2 + 2 l 2 \u2a7d Al 1 l 2 + 2 L 2 . Rearranging the terms, we obtain L 2 ( AL 1 \u2212 2) \u2a7d l 2 ( Al 1 \u2212 2). It follows from the condition A > 2 that AL 1 \u2212 2 \u2a7e Al 1 \u2212 2 \u2a7e A 2 \u2212 2 > 0, which imply L 1 = l 1 and L 2 = l 2 . Thus, the two limits lim n \u2192 \u221e x n and lim n \u2192 \u221e y n exist. From the uniqueness of the positive equilibrium ( c , c ) of (1.4) , we conclude that lim n \u2192 \u221e x n = c and lim n \u2192 \u221e y n = c . \u25a1 From Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 , we establish the following result related to the asymptotic behavior of the positive solutions of (1.4) . Theorem\u00a04.3 Assume A > 2 and max{ p, r, s } \u2a7e 2. Then the positive equilibrium (c, c) of ( 1.4 ) is globally asymptotically stable for all positive solutions.

        "abstract": "The new cyber attack pattern of advanced persistent threat (APT) has posed a serious threat to modern society. This paper addresses the APT defense problem, i.e., the problem of how to effectively defend against an APT campaign. Based on a novel APT attack-defense model, the effectiveness of an APT defense strategy is quantified. Thereby, the APT defense problem is modeled as an optimal control problem, in which an optimal control stands for a most effective APT defense strategy. The existence of an optimal control is proved, and an optimality system is derived. Consequently, an optimal control can be figured out by solving the optimality system. Some examples of the optimal control are given. Finally, the influence of some factors on the effectiveness of an optimal control is examined through computer experiments. These findings help organizations to work out policies of defending against APTs.",

This paper addresses the patch injection problem, i.e., the problem of developing a patch injection strategy to mitigate the negative impact of virus attacks. As the impact of an attack depends on not only the patch injection strategy but the unknown virus injection strategy, the patch injection problem is very complicated. This paper initiates the study of the patch injection problem by means of security economics and differential game theory. First, based on a novel virus-patch mixed propagation model, we model the original problem as a differential game. Second, we develop a method for finding a candidate for the Nash equilibrium of the game, examine the structure of the candidate, and give some examples of the candidate. Furthermore, we demonstrate through comparative experiments that the candidate is better in terms of the Nash equilibrium solution concept. Therefore, we recommend the patch injection strategy in the candidate. Finally, we examine the effects of some factors on the performance of the recommended patch injection strategy. Overall, these findings undoubtedly have guiding significance to defense against virus infections.",

        "abstract": "Li and Zhu [Applied Mathematics and Computation, 150 (2004) 481] studied the difference equation x n = x n - 1 x n - 2 + x n - 3 + a x n - 1 + x n - 2 x n - 3 + a , n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 where a \u2a7e 0. They claimed that the unique positive equilibrium of the equation is globally asymptotically stable. Unfortunately, there is a subtle mistake in their proof. In this paper, we present a correct proof for this claim. Keywords Difference equation Global asymptotic stability Semicycle 1 Introduction Qualitative analysis of difference equations is not only interesting in its own right, but it can provide insights into their continuous counterparts, namely, differential equations. Amleh et al. [1] proved the global asymptotic stability of the unique positive equilibrium of the difference equation (1.1) x n = x n - 1 + x n - 2 x n - 3 x n - 1 x n - 2 + x n - 3 , n \u2a7e 1 . Nesemann [5] argued the global asymptotic stability of the unique positive equilibrium of the difference equation (1.2) x n = x n - 2 + x n - 1 x n - 3 x n - 1 x n - 2 + x n - 3 , n \u2a7e 1 is globally asymptotically stable. Motivated by these work, Li and Zhu [4] studied the difference equation (1.3) x n = x n - 1 x n - 2 + x n - 3 + a x n - 1 + x n - 2 x n - 3 + a , n \u2a7e 1 , where a \u2a7e 0. They claimed that the unique positive equilibrium x \u00af = 1 of Eq. (1.3) is globally asymptotically stable. For other related work see [2,3,6] and the references cited therein. Unfortunately, there exists a subtle mistake in the argument provided in [4] . In this paper, we present a correct proof for the claim. 2 The global asymptotic stability of the positive equilibrium of Eq. (1.3) In this section, we establish the following result. Theorem\u00a02.1 The positive equilibrium x \u00af = 1 of Eq. ( 1.3 ) is globally asymptotically stable. To prove this result, we need the following three equivalent expressions of Eq. (1.3) : (2.1) x n - 1 = ( x n - 2 - 1 ) ( x n - 1 - x n - 3 ) x n - 1 + x n - 2 x n - 3 + a , n \u2a7e 1 , (2.2) x n - x n - 2 = ( 1 - x n - 2 ) ( x n - 2 x n - 3 + x n - 3 + a ) x n - 1 + x n - 2 x n - 3 + a , n \u2a7e 1 , (2.3) x n - 1 x n - 2 = ( x n - 2 - 1 ) ( x n - 1 x n - 2 + x n - 1 + a ) x n - 2 ( x n - 1 + x n - 2 x n - 3 + a ) , n \u2a7e 1 . From Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) one can obtain Lemma\u00a02.2 [4, Lemma 2.4] Consider a positive solution of Eq. ( 1.2 ) with (x 0 \u2212 1)(x \u2212 1 \u2212 1)(x 0 \u2212 x \u2212 2 ) \u2260 0. Then with the possible exception of the first semicycle the following affirmations are valid: (a) Every negative semicycle consists of one or two terms, and every positive semicycle consists of one or three terms. (b) Every negative semicycle of length one is followed by a positive semicycle of length three, and every negative semicycle of length two is followed by a positive semicycle of length one. (c) Every positive semicycle of length one is followed by a negative semicycle of length one, and every positive semicycle of length three is followed by a negative semicycle of length two. The following lemma, which is useful for the proof of Theorem 2.1 , is an immediate consequence of Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) . Lemma\u00a02.3 Let {x n } be a positive solution of Eq. ( 1.2 ) with (x 0 \u2212 1)(x \u2212 1 \u2212 1)(x 0 \u2212 x \u2212 2 ) \u2260 0. Let p \u2a7e 1 be an integer. (a) x p \u2212 2 < x p when x p \u2212 2 < 1, and x p \u2212 2 > x p when x p \u2212 2 > 1. (b) x p - 2 < 1 x p when x p \u2212 2 < 1, and x p - 2 > 1 x p when x p \u2212 2 > 1. We are now in a position to prove Theorem 2.1 . Proof of Theorem\u00a02.1 Let { x n } be a positive solution of Eq. (1.3) . If ( x 0 - 1 ) ( x - 1 - 1 ) ( x 0 - x - 2 ) = 0 , it is easily proved that lim n \u2192\u221e x n = 1 (see [4] ). We now assume ( x 0 \u2212 1)( x \u22121 \u2212 1)( x 0 \u2212 x \u22122 ) \u2260 0. Let ( x p ) be a positive semicycle (other than the first semicycle) of { x n }. As was indicated by Li and Zhu [4] , Lemma 2.2 implies that for each nonnegative integer n , ( x p +7 n ) is a positive semicycle, ( x p +7 n + 1 ) is a negative semicycle, ( x p +7 n +2 , x p +7 n +3 , x p +7 n +4 ) is a positive semicycle, and ( x p +7 n +5 , x p +7 n +6 ) is a negative semicycle. It follows by repeatedly applying Lemma 2.3 that (2.4) x p + 14 n > x p + 14 n + 2 > x p + 14 n + 4 > 1 x p + 14 n + 6 > 1 x p + 14 n + 8 > x p + 14 n + 10 > 1 x p + 14 n + 12 > x p + 14 n + 14 . From (2.4) we can see that the subsequence { x p +14 n } is strictly monotonically decreasing and bounded below by 1. So the limit lim n \u2192\u221e x p +14 n exists. Let \u03b1 = lim n \u2192\u221e x p +14 n . Again from (2.4) we conclude that (2.5) lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 2 = lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 4 = lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 10 = \u03b1 , (2.6) lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 6 = lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 8 = lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 12 = 1 \u03b1 . Similarly, by repeatedly applying Lemma 2.3 , we have (2.7) x p + 14 n + 7 > x p + 14 n + 9 > x p + 14 n + 11 > 1 x p + 14 n + 13 > 1 x p + 14 n + 15 > x p + 14 n + 17 > 1 x p + 14 n + 19 > x p + 14 n + 21 . From (2.7) we know that the subsequence { x p +14 n +7 } is strictly monotonically decreasing and bounded below by 1. So the limit lim n \u2192\u221e x p +14 n +7 exists. Let \u03b2 = lim n \u2192\u221e x p +14 n +7 . Again from (2.7) we conclude that (2.8) lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 9 = lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 11 = lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 3 = \u03b2 , (2.9) lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 13 = lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 1 = lim n \u2192 \u221e x p + 14 n + 5 = 1 \u03b2 . Consider Eq. (1.3) where n is replaced with p + 14 n +10. That is, (2.10) x p + 14 n + 10 = x p + 14 n + 9 x p + 14 n + 8 + x p + 14 n + 7 + a x p + 14 n + 9 + x p + 14 n + 8 x p + 14 n + 7 + a . Taking the limits on both sides of Eq. (2.10) and in view of (2.5), (2.6), (2.8), and (2.9) , we obtain \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u00d7 1 \u03b1 + \u03b2 + a \u03b2 + 1 \u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b2 + a = 1 . Consider Eq. (1.3) where n is replaced with p + 14 n +3. That is, (2.11) x p + 14 n + 3 = x p + 14 n + 2 x p + 14 n + 1 + x p + 14 n + a x p + 14 n + 2 + x p + 14 n + 1 x p + 14 n + a . Taking the limits on both sides of Eq. (2.11) and in view of (2.5),(2.6),(2.8), and (2.9) , we have \u03b2 = \u03b1 \u00d7 1 \u03b2 + \u03b1 + a \u03b1 + 1 \u03b2 \u00d7 \u03b1 + a = 1 . The previous discussions lead to lim n \u2192\u221e x n = 1. Hence the positive equilibrium x \u00af = 1 of Eq. (1.3) is globally asymptotically stable. \u25a1 Remark In the Li and Zhu\u2019s proof, they claimed that (2.12) x p + 7 n + 4 < x p + 7 n + 3 < x p + 7 n + 2 and x p + 7 n + 6 > x p + 7 n + 5 ( [4] , page 489, line 6) from which they derived that the subsequence { x p +7 n +1 } is strictly monotonically increasing with an upper bound of 1 and hence the limit lim n \u2192\u221e x p +7 n +1 exists ( [4] , page 489, lines 2\u20133 from below). The two chains of inequalities in (2.12) , however, are not necessarily valid. As a result, their proof is not valid.

In practice, a tradeoff between the two strategies, which is known as the TSRB strategy, may achieve a better cost-effectiveness. This paper is devoted to assessing the effectiveness of the TSRB strategy. For that purpose, an individual-level spreading model (the generic URQT model) capturing the interaction between a rumor and the truth is established. Under the model, a set of criteria for the dying out of a rumor is presented. These criteria capture the combined influence of the basic parameters and the network structures on the effectiveness of the TSRB strategy. Experimental results show that, when the rumor dies out, the dynamics of a simplified URQT model (the linear URQT model) fits well with the actual rumor-truth interacting process. Therefore, the generic URQT model and sometimes the linear URQT model provide a proper basis for assessing the effectiveness of the TSRB strategy.",

This paper is concerned with the problem of embedding meshes/tori in faulty crossed cubes. We reduce this mesh/tori embedding problem to the problem of embedding paths/cycles in faulty crossed cubes. Then, by exploiting the fault-tolerant pancyclicity of crossed cubes of lower dimension, several schemes for embedding 2D or 3D meshes/tori in faulty crossed cubes are proposed. All of these embeddings have small dilations and small congestions. The obtained results show that the parallel algorithms with mesh/torus task graphs can be efficiently executed on faulty crossed cubes.",

The oxidation products 3a-c have been structurally characterized and display an unusual parallel stacked arrangement of the disq- ligands in the solid state, with a separation of approximately 3 A. Density functional calculations show a bonding-type interaction between the SOMOs of the disq- ligands to form a unique HOMO while the antibonding linear combination forms a unique LUMO. This orbital configuration leads to a closed-shell-singlet ground-state electron configuration (S = 0). Temperature-dependent magnetism measurements indicate a low-lying triplet excited state at approximately 750 cm-1. In solution, 3a-c show strong disq--based absorption bands that are invariant across the halide series. Taken together these spectroscopic measurements provide experimental values for the one- and two-electron energies that characterize the pi-stacked bonding interaction between the two disq- ligands.",

We find that the ratio of infected female density to infected male density is determined by the topology of the network and the proportion between infection rates of females and males. This demonstrates the importance of the topology of network. Finally, we present numerical simulation results that support the analytic results.",

This Ru(I) dimer with two bridging chlorides shows no reactivity towards H(2), N(2), N(2)O or methyl triflate, but does add HCl to form (Cym)(2)Ru(2)HCl(3). Attempts to form a monomeric monovalent ruthenium complex with dppm, Ph(2)PCH(2)PPh(2), gives disproportionation to (Cym)RuCl(2)(eta(1)-dppm) and (Cym)Ru(eta(2)-dppm). With terpyridyl, the analogous disproportionation behavior is observed, to form Ru(terpy)(2)(2+) and a zero valent product, which decomposed before it could be isolated. The molecular orbitals, from a DFT calculation, of [(Cym)RuCl](2) show the LUMO to be in a sterically crowded region of the molecule, and thus helps to account for the reactivity targeted for small and more nucleophilic reagents, while the HOMO is accessible to reaction with HCl.",

        "abstract": "The resting state of the recently reported water oxidation catalyst [tpyRu(II)-OH(2)](2)L(3+) (tpy = terpyridine; L = bipyridylpyrazolylic anion) ([2,2](3+)) must be activated by a series of proton-coupled oxidations in which four protons and four electrons are removed overall to afford the catalytically competent species [tpyRu(IV)O](2)L(3+) ([4,4](3+)). We have examined all of the plausible redox intermediates utilizing density functional theory coupled to a continuum solvation model. Our calculations reproduce well the first three redox potentials under pH = 1 conditions, and a reasonable correlation between theory and experiment is found for the fourth irreversible redox process that accompanies O(2) generation. The computed oxidation potentials to access [5,4](4+) and [5,5](5+), 1.875 and 2.032 V vs NHE, respectively, exclude the otherwise plausible possibilities of the catalytically active species having a higher oxidation state. [4,4](3+) has an antiferromagnetically coupled ground state in which one ruthenium has two unpaired electrons antiparallel to those of the other ruthenium. As we found in our previous work, two radicaloid terminal oxygen moieties with different spin orientations that are induced by spin polarization from the electron-deficient Ru(IV) centers are found. Two mechanistic scenarios are relevant and interesting for the key O-O bond formation event: intramolecular oxo-oxo coupling and coupling between one terminal oxo and the oxygen atom of the incoming water substrate. The intramolecular oxo-oxo coupling is facile, with a low barrier of 13.9 kcal mol(-1), yielding a peroxo intermediate. The necessary subsequent addition of water in an associative substitution mechanism to cleave one of the Ru-peroxo bonds, however, is found to be impractical at room temperature, with a barrier of DeltaG(double dagger) = 30.9 kcal mol(-1). Thus, while plausible, the intramolecular oxo-oxo coupling is unproductive for generating molecular dioxygen. The intermolecular O-O coupling is associated with a high barrier (DeltaG(double dagger) = 40.2 kcal mol(-1)) and requires the assistance of an additional proton, which lowers the barrier dramatically to 24.5 kcal mol(-1).",

        "abstract": "Radiance coming from the interior of an uncooled infrared camera has a significant effect on the measured value of the temperature\n of the object. This paper presents a three-phase compensation scheme for coping with this effect. The first phase acquires\n the calibration data and forms the calibration function by least square fitting. Likewise, the second phase obtains the compensation\n data and builds the compensation function by fitting. With the aid of these functions, the third phase determines the temperature\n of the object in concern from any given ambient temperature.\n \n It is known that acquiring the compensation data of a camera is very time-consuming. For the purpose of getting the compensation\n data at a reasonable time cost, we propose a transplantable scheme. The idea of this scheme is to calculate the ratio between\n the central pixel\u2019s responsivity of the child camera to the radiance from the interior and that of the mother camera, followed\n by determining the compensation data of the child camera using this ratio and the compensation data of the mother camera\n \n \n \n Experimental results show that either of the child camera and the mother camera can measure the temperature of the object\n with an error of no more than 2C.",

One striking advantage of our method is that the differential operator, boundary conditions and numerical fluxes involved in the elementwise computation can be done with lower time cost.

        "abstract": "Sonar images are usually highly corrupted by reverberations caused by the complex generation mechanism. In order to prepare the image for further segmentation, recognition or other processing, certain suppression and enhancement should be applied in advance. A wavelet domain solution combined with spatial correlation and fuzzy logic method for reverberation suppression and contrast enhancement was proposed. This algorithm adopts a new local correlation coefficient matrix considering local property in the next scale, which increased the ability of edge detection. Meanwhile, a fuzzy theory based algorithm was used to enhance the useful information in sonar images. Experiments show that this method significantly decreases the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), while increase the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Compared with other methods, this method is suitable for sonar image pre-processing.",

First, we give the threshold value R0 determining whether the virus dies out completely. Second, we study the local asymptotic stability of the equilibria of this model and it is found that, depending on the time delays, a Hopf bifurcation may occur in the model. Next, we prove that, if R0 = 1, the virus-free equilibrium is globally attractive; and when R0 < 1, it is globally asymptotically stable. Finally, a sufficient criterion for the global stability of the virus equilibrium is obtained. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The shortest path routing in FCCNs is an open problem. In this paper, we present an oblivious routing algorithm for n-level FCCN with N = 8n nodes, and prove that this algorithm creates a shortest path from the source to the destination. At the costs of both an O(N)-parallel-step off-line preprocessing phase and a list of size N stored at each node, the proposed algorithm is carried out at each related node in O(n) time. In some cases the proposed algorithm is superior to the one proposed by Chang and Wang in terms of the length of the routing path. This justifies the utility of our routing strategy.",

One demerit of this algorithm is that this fitness function takes only one syndrome from many possible candidates, leading to a high probability of incorrect diagnosis. In the present paper, the authors describe a set of equations that govern the statuses of the units in a system. Based on this, the authors present a new genetic algorithm for the fault diagnosis of diagnosable systems by designing a novel fitness function. Theoretical analysis and simulation result both show that the algorithm is remarkably superior to the Elhadef-Ayeb's diagnosis algorithm in terms of the number of iterations. The initial population production process proposed by Elhadef and Ayeb is also justified.",

This paper is concerned with the fault-tolerant cycle embedding ability of a subclass of hypercube-like networks, called restricted hypercube-like networks (RHLNs, for short), which include most of the well-known hypercube variants, such as the twisted cubes, the crossed cubes, the locally twisted cubes, and the M\u00f6bius cubes. We show that for n \u2265 5 and f \u2264 2n - 7, a fault-free cycle of length at least 2 n - f - (n - 5) can be embedded in an n-dimensional RHLN with f faulty nodes. Our work extends the previous known result in the sense of maximum number of faulty nodes tolerable in an RHLN.",

Secondly, a novel color image segmentation method based on graph-cut, whose seeds can be auto-marked, is proposed, and with the method, paint bubbles are extracted from image. Finally, with camera calibrated parameter, the size of segmented paint bubbles is figured out.

In this context, we give the threshold for determining whether the virus dies out completely. Then, we study the existence of equilibria, and analyze their local and global asymptotic stability. Next, we find that, depending on the anti-virus ability, a backward bifurcation or a Hopf bifurcation may occur. Finally, we show that under appropriate conditions, bistable states may be around. Numerical results illustrate some typical phenomena that may occur in the virus propagation over computer network. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Circulating the truth and quarantining a subset of rumor spreaders are two major rumor-quelling strategies. In practice, a mixture of the two strategies may be more effective than any one of the two strategies. This paper focuses on effectiveness analysis of the mixed strategy. For this purpose, we are going to establish a rumor-truth competing model on two-layer network. First, we introduce a Markov model characterizing the stochastic dynamics of the rumor-truth competing process, and write the corresponding Kolmogorov model capturing the expected dynamics of the rumor-truth competing process. Second, we give a bilinear model as the first approximation to the Kolmogorov model, and suggest a generic model as a more accurate approximation to the Kolmogorov model. The two models are the focus of concern in this work. For ease in treatment, we describe a limit system of the generic model. By studying the limit model, we present a criterion for the rumor to subside, a criterion for the rumor not necessarily to subside, and a criterion for the rumor to persist, respectively. These findings are instructive to the quelling of false rumors. Finally, through computer experiments we find that when a rumor subsides, the bilinear model is a good approximation to the Kolmogorov model.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the asymptotic behavior of positive solutions to the difference equation x n = max 1 x n - 1 \u03b1 , A x n - 2 , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , where 0 < \u03b1 < 1, A > 0. We prove that every positive solution of this equation approaches x \u2217 = 1 or is eventually periodic with period 4 according as A \u2a7d 1 or A > 1. Keywords Difference equation Global attractivity Eventual periodicity 1 Introduction Ladas [6] initiated the study of the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the difference equation (1.1) x n = max A 1 x n - 1 , A 2 x n - 2 , \u2026 , A p x n - p , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 Specifically, the following two conjectures were proposed: Conjecture\u00a01 If A 1 , A 2 , \u2026 , A p are nonnegative real numbers with A 1 + A 2 + \u22ef + A p > 0, then every positive solution to ( 1.1 ) is eventually periodic with period T \u2208 { 2, 3, \u2026 , 2p } . Conjecture\u00a02 If A 1 , A 2 , \u2026 , A p are nonnegative real numbers with A 1 + A 2 + \u22ef + A p > 0, A q > max{ A j : 1 \u2a7d j \u2a7d p, j \u2260 q } , then every positive solution to ( 1.1 ) is eventually periodic with period T = 2q. These conjectures were partially confirmed by Amleh et al. [1] , Mishev et al. [7] and Voulov [10,11] . In particular, Amleh et al. [1] considered the difference equation. (1.2) x n = max 1 x n - 1 , A x n - 2 , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , where A > 0. They proved that every positive solution to (1.2) is eventually periodic with period T , where T is defined by T = 2 if 0 < A < 1 , 3 if A = 1 , 4 if A > 1 . Recently, Bidwell [2] proved the following result: Theorem\u00a01.1 If A 1 , A 2 , \u2026 , A p are nonnegative real numbers with A 1 + A 2 + \u22ef + A p > 0, then (i) every positive solution to ( 1.1 ) is eventually periodic, and (ii) the maximum prime period grows exponentially with the system size. As a result of this theorem, Conjecture 1 is half-proved and half-disproved. To our knowledge, Conjecture 2 remains yet to be solved. When some of the coefficients in (1.1) are negative, the asymptotic behavior of solutions was examined by Amleh et al. [1] , Bidwell [2] and Szalkai [9] . Also some variants of (1.1) with periodic coefficients were investigated [3\u20135,8] . Motivated by the aforementioned work and by computer simulations, this paper addresses the asymptotic behavior of positive solutions to the difference equation (1.3) x n = max 1 x n - 1 \u03b1 , A x n - 2 , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , where 0 < \u03b1 < 1, A > 0. We prove that every positive solution to this equation approaches x \u2217 = 1 or is eventually periodic with period 4 according as A \u2a7d 1 or A > 1. 2 The case A = 1 In this section, we consider the difference equation (2.1) x n = max 1 / x n - 1 \u03b1 , 1 / x n - 2 , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , where 0 < \u03b1 < 1. Theorem\u00a02.1 Let {x n } be a positive solution to ( 2.1 ) . Then x n \u2192 1. Proof Choose a number B so that 0 < B < 1, Let x n = B y n , n \u2a7e - 2 . Then { y n } is a solution to the difference equation (2.2) y n = min { - \u03b1 y n - 1 , - y n - 2 } , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 To prove x n \u2192 1, it suffices to prove y n \u2192 0. Observe that there is a positive integer N such that for all n \u2a7e 0, y 3 n + N \u2a7e 0, y 3 n + N +1 \u2a7d 0, y 3 n + N +2 \u2a7d 0. By simple computation, we get that, for all n \u2a7e 0, y 3 n + N + 2 = - y 3 n + N , y 3 n + N + 4 = - \u03b1 y 3 n + N + 3 , 0 < y 3 n + N + 3 \u2a7d \u03b1 y 3 n + N . So, y 3 n + N \u2192 0, y 3 n + N +2 \u2192 0, y 3 n + N +1 \u2192 0. This implies y n \u2192 0. \u25a1 3 The case 0 < A < 1 In this section, we consider the difference equation (3.1) x n = max 1 / x n - 1 \u03b1 , A / x n - 2 , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , where 0 < \u03b1 < 1, 0 < A < 1. Theorem\u00a03.1 Let {x n } be a positive solution to ( 3.1 ) . Then x n \u2192 1. Proof Let x n = A y n , n \u2a7e - 2 . Then { y n } is a solution to the difference equation (3.2) y n = min { - \u03b1 y n - 1 , 1 - y n - 2 } , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 To prove x n \u2192 1, it suffices to prove y n \u2192 0. If y \u22121 = 0, y \u22122 = 0, then we have y n = 0 for all n \u2a7e \u22122. Next, we assume either y \u22121 \u2260 0 or y \u22122 \u2260 0. The following four claims are obviously true. Claim I: If y n \u22121 \u2a7e 0 and y n \u22122 \u2a7e 0 for some n , then \u2223 y n \u2223 \u2a7d max{ \u03b1 \u2223 y n \u22121 \u2223,\u2223 y n \u22122 \u2223 \u2212 1}. Claim II: If y n \u22121 \u2a7d 0 and y n \u22122 \u2a7d 0 for some n , then \u2223 y n \u2223 \u2a7d \u03b1 \u2223 y n \u22121 \u2223. Claim III: If y n \u22121 \u2a7e 0 and y n \u22122 \u2a7d 0 for some n , then \u2223 y n \u2223 = \u03b1 \u2223 y n \u22121 \u2223. Claim IV: If y n \u22121 \u2a7d 0 and y n \u22122 \u2a7e 0 for some n , then \u2223 y n \u2223 \u2a7d max{ \u03b1 \u2223 y n \u22121 \u2223,\u2223 y n \u22122 \u2223 \u2212 1}. In general, we have (3.3) | y n | \u2a7d max { \u03b1 | y n - 1 | , | y n - 2 | - 1 } , n \u2a7e 0 . A direct consequence of (3.3) is (3.4) | y n | \u2a7d max { | y n - 1 | , | y n - 2 | } , n \u2a7e 0 . From (3.4) and by induction, we get (3.5) | y n | \u2a7d max { | y - 1 | , | y - 2 | } , n \u2a7e 0 . Choose a number \u03b2 so that 1 - 1 max { | y - 1 | , | y - 2 | } \u2a7d \u03b2 < 1 . Then (3.6) | y - 1 | \u2a7d 1 1 - \u03b2 , | y - 2 | \u2a7d 1 1 - \u03b2 . (3.5) and (3.6) yield (3.7) | y n | - 1 \u2a7d \u03b2 | y n | , n \u2a7e - 2 . Let \u03b3 = max{ \u03b1 , \u03b2 }. Then 0 < \u03b3 < 1, and (3.3) and (3.7) lead to (3.8) | y n | \u2a7d \u03b3 max { | y n - 1 | , | y n - 2 | } , n \u2a7e 0 . From (3.8) and by induction, we get (3.9) | y n | \u2a7d \u03b3 \u2308 n / 2 \u2309 max { | y n - 2 \u2308 n / 2 \u2309 + 1 | , | y n - 2 \u2308 n / 2 \u2309 | } , n \u2a7e 0 . This implies y n \u2192 0. \u25a1 4 The case A > 1 In this section, we consider the difference equation (4.1) x n = max { 1 / x n - 1 \u03b1 , A / x n - 2 } , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , where A > 1. Theorem\u00a04.1 Let {x n } be a positive solution to ( 4.1 ) . Then there is an integer N such that x n+2 = \u2212 x n for all n \u2a7e N. Proof Let x n = A y n + 1 / 2 , n \u2a7e \u22122. Then { y n } is a solution to the difference equation. (4.2) y n = max - \u03b1 y n - 1 - 1 + \u03b1 2 , - y n - 2 , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 To prove the desired result, it suffices to show that there is an integer N such that y n +2 = \u2212 y n for all n \u2a7e N . By computation, we get Claim I: If for some integer N , we have max 1 \u03b1 y N - 1 + \u03b1 2 \u03b1 , - \u03b1 y N - 1 + \u03b1 2 \u2a7d y N + 1 \u2a7d min 1 \u03b1 y N + 1 + \u03b1 2 \u03b1 , - \u03b1 y N + 1 + \u03b1 2 , then y n +2 = \u2212 y n for all n \u2a7e N . From Claim I, we immediately obtain Claim II: If for some integer N , we have - ( 1 + \u03b1 ) 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) \u2a7d y N \u2a7d 1 - \u03b1 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) , y N + 1 = - \u03b1 y N - 1 + \u03b1 2 , then y n +2 = \u2212 y n for all n \u2a7e N . From (4.2) , we can assume that y N +1 = \u2212 \u03b1y N \u2212 (1 + \u03b1 )/2 holds for some integer N ; otherwise the desired result is already proven. If - ( 1 + \u03b1 ) 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) \u2a7d y N \u2a7d 1 - \u03b1 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) , the desired result follows from Claim II. Below we examine the two remaining cases. Case 1: y N < - ( 1 + \u03b1 ) 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) , y N + 1 = - \u03b1 y N - 1 + \u03b1 2 . By computation, we get y N + 2 = - y N , y N + 3 = - y N + 1 . Observe that y N + 3 < 1 - \u03b1 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) and y N + 3 - y N = ( \u03b1 - 1 ) y N + 1 + \u03b1 2 > 1 + \u03b1 2 . We proceed by checking two possibilities. Case 1.1: - ( 1 + \u03b1 ) 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) \u2a7d y N + 3 < 1 - \u03b1 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) . Observe that y N + 4 = - \u03b1 y N + 3 - 1 + \u03b1 2 , the desired result follows from Claim II. Case 1.2: y N + 3 < - ( 1 + \u03b1 ) 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) . By computation, we can derive y N + 4 = - \u03b1 y N + 3 - 1 + \u03b1 2 , y N + 5 = - y N + 3 , y N + 6 = - y N + 4 . Likewise, there are two possibilities: - ( 1 + \u03b1 ) 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) \u2a7d y N + 6 < 1 - \u03b1 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) or y N + 6 < - ( 1 + \u03b1 ) 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) . Observe that y N + 3 - y N = ( \u03b1 - 1 ) y N + 1 + \u03b1 2 > 1 + \u03b1 2 , y N + 6 - y N + 3 = ( \u03b1 - 1 ) y N + 3 + 1 + \u03b1 2 > 1 + \u03b1 2 , \u2026 This process will continue until there is a positive integer M such that - ( 1 + \u03b1 ) 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) \u2a7d y 3 M + N < 1 - \u03b1 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) . Then y 3 M + N + 1 = - \u03b1 y 3 M + N - 1 + \u03b1 2 , and the desired result follows from Claim II. Case 2: y N > 1 - \u03b1 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) , y N + 1 = - \u03b1 y N - 1 + \u03b1 2 . By computation, we get y N + 2 = - \u03b1 y N + 1 - 1 + \u03b1 2 . Observe that y N + 1 < - ( 1 + \u03b1 ) 2 2 ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) . The subsequent argument is analogous to that for Case 1. \u25a1 As a direct consequence of Theorem 4.1 , we get Theorem\u00a04.2 Let {x n } be a positive solution to ( 4.1 ) . Then x n is eventually periodic with period 4. 5 Conclusions and remarks This paper has examined the asymptotic behavior of positive solutions to the difference Eq. (1.3) with 0 < \u03b1 < 1, A > 0. The method used in this work may provide insight into the asymptotic behavior of positive solutions to the generic difference equation (5.1) x n = max A 1 x n - 1 \u03b1 1 , A 2 x n - 2 \u03b1 2 , \u2026 , A p x n - p \u03b1 p , n = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , where A 1 \u2a7e 0, A 2 \u2a7e 0, \u2026 , A p \u2a7e 0, 0 < \u03b1 1 \u2a7d 1, 0 < \u03b1 2 \u2a7d 1, \u2026 , 0 < \u03b1 p \u2a7d 1, max{ \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , \u2026 , \u03b1 p } = 1. We close this work by presenting the following conjecture: Conjecture\u00a05.1 Let \u03b1 q = 1. If A q > max{ A j : 1 \u2a7d j \u2a7d p, j \u2260 q } , then every positive solution to ( 5.1 ) is eventually periodic with period T = 2q. Clearly, this conjecture includes Conjecture 2 given in the first section of this paper as special case.

The proposed condition and estimate are easily checkable and applicable, because they are phrased only in terms of the network parameters, the nonlinearities of the neurons, and the relevant equilibrium point.

In the case k=2, to our knowledge, there is no known t/k diagnosis algorithm for general diagnosable system or for any specific system. Hypercube is a popular topology for interconnecting processors of multicomputers. It is known that an n-dimensional cube is (4n-9)/3-diagnosable. This paper addresses the (4n-9)/3 diagnosis of n-dimensional cube. By exploring the relationship between a largest connected component of the 0-test subgraph of a faulty hypercube and the distribution of the faulty nodes over the network, the fault diagnosis of an n-dimensional cube can be reduced to those of two constituent (n-1)-dimensional cubes. On this basis, a diagnosis algorithm is presented. Given that there are no more than 4n-9 faulty nodes, this algorithm can isolate all faulty nodes to within a set in which at most three nodes are fault-free. The proposed algorithm can operate in O(Nlog\"2N) time, where N=2^n is the total number of nodes of the hypercube. The work of this paper provides insight into developing efficient t/k diagnosis algorithms for larger k value and for other types of interconnection networks.",

        "abstract": "There are quite a number of different metrics of network robustness. This paper addresses the rationality of four metrics of network robustness (the algebraic connectivity, the effective resistance, the average edge betweenness, and the efficiency) by investigating the robust growth of generalized meshes (GMs). First, a heuristic growth algorithm (the Proximity-Growth algorithm) is proposed. The resulting proximity-optimal GMs are intuitively robust and hence are adopted as the benchmark. Then, a generalized mesh (GM) is grown up by stepwise optimizing a given measure of network robustness. The following findings are presented: (1) The algebraic connectivity-optimal GMs deviate quickly from the proximity-optimal GMs, yielding a number of less robust GMs. This hints that the rationality of the algebraic connectivity as a measure of network robustness is still in doubt. (2) The effective resistace-optimal GMs and the average edge betweenness-optimal GMs are in line with the proximity-optimal GMs. This partly justifies the two quantities as metrics of network robustness. (3) The efficiency-optimal GMs deviate gradually from the proximity-optimal GMs, yielding some less robust GMs. This suggests the limited utility of the efficiency as a measure of network robustness.

        "abstract": "Viral marketing has been one of the main marketing modes. However, theoretical study of viral marketing is still lacking. This paper focuses on the problem of developing a cost-effective dynamic discount pricing strategy for a viral marketing campaign. First, based on a novel word-of-mouth propagation model, we model the original problem as an optimal control problem. Second, we show that the optimal control problem admits an optimal control and present the optimality system for solving the optimal control problem. Next, we solve some optimal control models to get their respective optimal dynamic discount pricing strategies. Finally, we examine the effect of some factors on the maximum marketing profit. These results contribute to gaining insight into viral marketing.",

This paper focuses on the modeling and analysis of the WOM marketing. A dynamic model, known as the SIPNS model, capturing the WOM marketing processes with both positive and negative comments is established. On this basis, a measure of the overall profit of a WOM marketing campaign is proposed. The SIPNS model is shown to admit a unique equilibrium, and the equilibrium is determined. The impact of different factors on the equilibrium of the SIPNS model is illuminated through theoretical analysis. Extensive experimental results suggest that the equilibrium is much likely to be globally attracting. Finally, the influence of different factors on the expected overall profit of a WOM marketing campaign is ascertained both theoretically and experimentally. Thereby, some promotion strategies are recommended. To our knowledge, this is the first time the WOM marketing is treated in this way.",

Based on a dynamic model characterizing the time evolution of the state of an organization, the organizationu0027s risk is defined as its maximum possible expected loss, and the risk assessment problem is modeled as a constrained optimization problem. The influence of different factors on an organizationu0027s risk is uncovered through theoretical analysis. Based on extensive experiments, we speculate that the attack strategy obtained by applying the hill-climbing method to the proposed optimization problem, which we call the HC strategy, always leads to the maximum possible expected loss. We then present a set of five heuristic attack strategies and, through comparative experiments, show that the HC strategy causes a higher risk than all these heuristic strategies do, which supports our conjecture. Finally, the impact of two factors on the attackeru0027s HC cost profit is determined through computer simulations. These findings help understand the risk of APTs in a quantitative manner.",

First, we propose a novel discount strategy we refer to as the Influence-Based Discount (IBD) strategy, in which each buyer would enjoy a discount that is linearly proportional to his/her influence in the WOM network. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of an IBD strategy, we model the associated WOM spreading process as a higher-dimensional nonlinear differential dynamical system we refer to as the Dormant-Potential-Adopting (DPA) model. Next, we examine the dynamics of a DPA model through computer experiments. Thereby, we estimate the expected net profit of an IBD strategy and inspect how different factors influence this profit through numerical experiments.

Isolating some rumor spreaders is an effective approach to limiting the spread of the rumor, at the cost of violating human rights. This paper focuses on developing an isolation\u2013conversion strategy to minimize the impact of the rumor. Based on a novel rumor\u2013truth mixed spreading model, we measure the impact of the rumor. On this basis, we model the isolation\u2013conversion problem as an optimal control problem. We show that the optimal control problem admits an optimal control, and we present the optimality system for solving the optimal control problem. We give some optimal isolation\u2013conversion strategies by solving the corresponding optimality systems. To our knowledge, this is the first time the isolation\u2013conversion problem is treated in this way.",

This paper addresses the optimal dynamical immunization under the widely accepted SIRS assumption. First, based on a controlled heterogeneous node-based SIRS model, an optimal control problem capturing the optimal dynamical immunization is formulated. Second, the existence of an optimal dynamical immunization scheme is shown, and the corresponding optimality system is derived. Next, some numerical examples are given to show that an optimal immunization strategy can be worked out by numerically solving the optimality system, from which it is found that the network topology has a complex impact on the optimal immunization strategy. Finally, the difference between a payoff and the minimum payoff is estimated in terms of the deviation of the corresponding immunization strategy from the optimal immunization strategy. The proposed optimal immunization scheme is justified, because it can achieve a low level of infections at a low cost.",

This paper aims to theoretically assess the impact of patch forwarding on the prevalence of computer virus. For that purpose, a new malware epidemic model, which takes into full account the influence of patch forwarding, is proposed. The dynamics of the model is revealed. Specifically, besides the permanent susceptible equilibrium, this model may admit an infected or a patched or a mixed equilibrium. Criteria for the global stability of the four equilibria are given, respectively, accompanied with numerical examples. The obtained results show that the spectral radii of the patch-forwarding network and the virus-spreading network both have a marked impact on the prevalence of computer virus. The influence of some key factors on the prevalence of virus is also revealed. Based on these findings, some strategies of containing electronic virus are recommended.",

        "abstract": "Advanced persistent threat (APT) is a new kind of cyberattack that poses a serious threat to modern society. When an APT campaign on an organization has been identified, the available repair resources must be reasonably allocated to the potentially insecure hosts to mitigate the potential loss of the organization. We refer to the feasible repair resource allocation strategies as repair strategies. This paper focuses on the APT repair problem, i.e., the problem of developing effective repair strategies for organizations. First, for an organization with time-varying communication relationship, we establish an evolution model of the organization\u2019s expected state, in which the impact of lateral movement of APT is accommodated. On this basis, we model the APT repair problem as a differential Nash game problem (the APT repair game) in which the attacker attempts to maximize his potential benefit, and the organization manages to minimize its potential loss. Second, we derive a system (the potential system) for calculating a potential Nash equilibrium of an APT repair game, and we examine the structure of the potential attack and repair strategies in a potential Nash equilibrium. Next, we solve some potential systems to get the corresponding potential Nash equilibria. Finally, by comparison with a large number of randomly generated attack and repair strategies, we conclude that the potential Nash equilibrium of each APT repair game is a Nash equilibrium of the game. Therefore, we recommend to organizations their respective potential repair strategies. Our findings help to better understand and effectively defend against APT.",

The locally twisted cube is a newly introduced hypercube variant, which not only possesses lower diameter and better graph embedding capability as compared with a hypercube of the same size, but retains some nice properties of hypercubes. This paper addresses the fault diagnosis of locally twisted cubes under the MM^* comparison model. By utilizing the existence of abundant cycles within a locally twisted cube, we present a new diagnosis algorithm. With elaborately organized data, this algorithm can run in O(Nlog\"2^2N) time, where N stands for the total number of nodes. In comparison, the classical Sengupta-Dahbura diagnosis algorithm takes as much as O(N^5) time to achieve the same goal. As a consequence, the proposed algorithm is remarkably superior to the Sengupta-Dahbura algorithm in terms of the time overhead.",

        "abstract": "Inevitably, there exist infected computers outside of the Internet. This paper aims to understand how infected external computers affect the spread of computer viruses. For that purpose, a new virus-antivirus spreading model, which takes into account the effect of infected/immune external computers, is established. A systematic study shows that, unlike most previous models, the proposed model admits no virus-free equilibrium and admits a globally asymptotically stable viral equilibrium. This result implies that it would be practically impossible to eradicate viruses on the Internet. As a result, inhibiting the virus prevalence to below an acceptable level would be the next best thing. A theoretical study reveals the effect of different parameters on the steady virus prevalence. On this basis, a number of suggestions are made so as to contain virus spreading. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

By incorporating the effect of removable storage media, considering the possibility of connecting infected computers to the Internet, and removing the conservative restriction on the total number of computers connected to the Internet, a new epidemic model is proposed.

With the aid of the theory of asymptotically autonomous systems as well as the generalized Poincare-Bendixson theorem, the endemic equilibrium is shown to be globally asymptotically stable. By analyzing the influence of different system parameters on the steady number of infected computers, a collection of policies is recommended to prohibit the virus prevalence. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

In addition, our results neither depend on monotonicity of the activation functions nor on coupling conditions between the neurons.

As compared to the classical precise diagnosis strategy, the t/k-diagnosis strategy can significantly improve the self-diagnosing capability of multiprocessor system. The generalised cube network (GCN), or equivalently the BC graphs, is a regular topology, which provides a unified view of the hypercube and some of its variants. This paper addressed the t/k-diagnosis of GCNs. By exploring the relationship between the size of a largest connected component of the 0-test subgraph of a faulty GCN and the distribution of the faulty nodes over the network, an [image omitted]\u00a0 time (4n\u00a0-\u00a09)/3 diagnosis algorithm on an n-dimensional GCN is presented, where N\u00a0=\u00a02n is the total number of the nodes of the network being diagnosed.

For that purpose, a novel computer virus propagation model, which incorporates a nonlinear vaccination probability, is proposed.

The results of simulation experiments not only demonstrate the validity of our model, but also show the effectiveness of nonlinear vaccination strategies.

Then K-SV algorithm is theoretically proved to be better than the MV algorithm. Finally, through computer simulations, the K-SV algorithm is shown to be much superior to the MV algorithm when run on hypercube systems.",

The diode was designed and fabricated by millimeter technology group, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. The mixer circuit is fully integrated with the microstrip circuit and the flip-chipped diode on suspended 50\u03bcm thick quartz substrate, its circuit configuration and cavity block are detailed in the paper. Based on ANSOFT's three-dimensional full-wave electromagnetic simulation software HFSS and AGILENT's circuit simulation software ADS, the 380 GHz sub-harmonically pumped mixer's system level modeling is studied. The simulation investigation shows state-of-the-art results obtained. A best conversion loss of 6.5dB is achieved with 3mW LO power at 383 GHz. At that best working frequency, the RF and LO port reflection loss are -14dB and -7dB, respectively. Over RF band of 365-395 GHz, the conversion loss is below 10 dB. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

The bandpass characteristics of the SRW and two BPFs with a concise transition operated at millimeter wave atmospheric window frequency are studied. The SRW has the advantages of remarkable simplicity and completely closed environment without energy leaking. Besides, energy transmission mode in SRW is a quasi TE10 mode which is similar to that in rectangular waveguide, which means that a SRW can easily get transition to a rectangular waveguide. So, compared to the traditional waveguide cavity BPF using metal diaphragm, printed circuit substrate or complex cross section, the SRW can be directly connected to a standard waveguide without additional metal diaphragm or substrate. To verify the bandpass characteristics of SRW, Ka band SRW BPF was designed and fabricated. Experimental results show low insertion loss (< 0.2 dB) in the whole Ka passband and sharp, wide rejection in the stopband (below-20 dB), with good agreement with simulated results. Therefore, the SRW will have wide potential applications in millimeter wave frequency range. \u00a9 2011 VSP.",

The GaAs Gunn oscillator is used as the local-oscillator (LO) and this paper also found an innovative nonlinear circuit model for GaAs Gunn diode in oscillator based on the physical mechanism. Its equivalent nonlinear circuit can assist the design of the Gunn LO. A best double-sideband-mixer loss of 6.4dB was achieved with 7mW of LO power at 224GHz.

In the field of space exploration, THz has important application prospects. Up to now, the atmospheric absorption attenuation model of THz wave is mostly horizontal transmission attenuation model. However, most aircraft ground detection is under slant path, not horizontal.

Algorithm based on finite difference method is developed to solve the Poisson equation, drift-diffusion equations, and current continuity equations. Charge transfer effect in the proposed solar cell is not significant due to light doping in the Si thin film. The open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current can be tuned by gate bias. As the magnitude of negative bias increases, both the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current increase due to the increase of Schottky barrier height and depletion width. Thin oxide thickness leads to high modulation efficiency. Optimization of the solar cell is achieved by introducing back field layer to increase carrier collection efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Modeling and simulation of Si/PEDOT:PSS planar heterojunction solar cell is performed by using the finite element method to solve Poisson equation, drift-diffusion equations and current continuity equations. PEDOT:PSS is a hole-rich organic semiconductor, which can be treated as highly p-type doped semiconductor. While, the 2\u03bcm silicon thin film is n-type doped. The Si/PEDOT:PSS heterojunction behaves like a pn junction rather than a Schottky junction as clarified in previous study and the PEDOT : PSS is much highly doped, the hole diffusion current in Si is the dominant current component. The simulated J-V characteristics of the Si/PEDOT:PSS planar heterojunction are obtained and compared with experiments.",

In order to make use of the advantages of Differentially Coherent Integration and reduce computational complexity, the paper optimizes the detection of Differentially Coherent Integration and proposes the algorithm of Envelope Replaced Differentially Coherent Integration (ERDCI). Through the analysis of its detection probability and false alarm probability, the proposed algorithm is superior to the original algorithm. The new algorithm is less dependent on hardware and is suitable for use scenarios with limited hardware conditions.",

        "abstract": "We have produced a superconducting binary-elements intercalated graphite, CaSrC, with the intercalation of Sr and Ca in highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite; the superconducting transition temperature, T , was ~3\u2009K. The superconducting CaSrC sample was fabricated with the nominal x value of 0.8, i.e., CaSrC. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy provided the stoichiometry of CaSrC for this sample, and the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern showed that CaSrC took the SrC-type hexagonal-structure rather than CaC-type rhombohedral-structure. Consequently, the chemical formula of CaSrC sample could be expressed as 'CaSrC'. The XRD pattern of CaSrC was measured at 0-31\u2009GPa, showing that the lattice shrank monotonically with increasing pressure up to 8.6\u2009GPa, with the structural phase transition occurring above 8.6\u2009GPa. The pressure dependence of T  was determined from the DC magnetic susceptibility and resistance up to 15\u2009GPa, which exhibited a positive pressure dependence of T  up to 8.3\u2009GPa, as in YbC, SrC, KC, CaC and CaKC. The further application of pressure caused the rapid decrease of T . In this study, the fabrication and superconducting properties of new binary-elements intercalated graphite, CaSrC, are fully investigated, and suitable combinations of elements are suggested for binary-elements intercalated graphite.",

The superconducting transition temperatures (T(c)s) of metal-doped FeSe and metal-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5, i.e., (EDA)(y)MxFeSe and (EDA)(y)MxFeSe0.5Te0.5 (M: Li, Na, and K), were 31-45 K and 19-25 K, respectively. The stoichiometry of each sample was clarified by energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and the x-ray powder diffraction pattern indicated a large expansion of lattice constant c, indicating the cointercalation of metal atoms and EDA. The pressure dependence of superconductivity in (EDA)(y)NaxFeSe0.5Te0.5 has been investigated at a pressure of 0-0.8GPa, showing negative pressure dependence in the same manner as (NH3)(y)NaxFeSe0.5Te0.5. The T-c-c phase diagrams of MxFeSe and MxFeSe0.5Te0.5 were drawn afresh from the T-c and c of (EDA)(y)MxFeSe and (EDA)(y)MxFeSe0.5Te0.5, showing that the T-c increases with increasing c but that extreme expansion of c reverses the T-c trend.",

        "abstract": "We have produced a superconducting binary-elements intercalated graphite, CaxSr1\u2212xCy, with the intercalation of Sr and Ca in highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite; the superconducting transition temperature, T                        c, was ~3\u2009K. The superconducting CaxSr1\u2212xCy sample was fabricated with the nominal x value of 0.8, i.e., Ca0.8Sr0.2Cy. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy provided the stoichiometry of Ca0.5(2)Sr0.5(2)Cy for this sample, and the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern showed that Ca0.5(2)Sr0.5(2)Cy took the SrC6-type hexagonal-structure rather than CaC6-type rhombohedral-structure. Consequently, the chemical formula of CaxSr1\u2212xCy sample could be expressed as \u2018Ca0.5(2)Sr0.5(2)C6\u2019. The XRD pattern of Ca0.5(2)Sr0.5(2)C6 was measured at 0\u201331\u2009GPa, showing that the lattice shrank monotonically with increasing pressure up to 8.6\u2009GPa, with the structural phase transition occurring above 8.6\u2009GPa. The pressure dependence of T                        c was determined from the DC magnetic susceptibility and resistance up to 15\u2009GPa, which exhibited a positive pressure dependence of T                        c up to 8.3\u2009GPa, as in YbC6, SrC6, KC8, CaC6 and Ca0.6K0.4C8. The further application of pressure caused the rapid decrease of T                        c. In this study, the fabrication and superconducting properties of new binary-elements intercalated graphite, CaxSr1\u2212xCy, are fully investigated, and suitable combinations of elements are suggested for binary-elements intercalated graphite.",

X-ray diffraction patterns of Ag0.05Bi1.95Se3 measured at 0\u201330 GPa showed three different structural phases, with rhombohedral, monoclinic, and tetragonal structures forming in turn as pressure increased, and structural phase transitions at 8.8 and 24 GPa. Ag0.05Bi1.95Se3 showed no superconductivity down to 2.0 K at 0 GPa, but under pressure, superconductivity suddenly appeared at 11 GPa. The magnetic field (H) dependence of the superconducting transition temperature Tc was measured at 11 and 20.5 GPa, in order to investigate whether the pressure-induced superconducting phase is explained by either p-wave polar model or s-wave model.",

        "abstract": "VOC emissions from refueling operations are in urgent need of control in China. As one of the precursors of O3 and fine particles, VOC emissions have great impacts on urban air quality. Due to the huge amount of VOC emitted through the refueling process, policies and measures to control refueling emissions should be developed by the government. The two major methods to control refueling VOC emissions are Stage II and onboard refueling vapor recovery (ORVR). The efficiency and costs of implementing these two approaches in China are projected. Each of these two approaches has advantages and disadvantages. The Stage II approach has more direct and rapid effect on urban air quality while the installation cost at the beginning is relatively large. The ORVR approach has the advantage of better control efficiency in the long term, but with increasing new vehicle population, the cost continues to rise. A combination approach is more cost effective to control Chinas VOC refueling emissions. Stage II installed in gas stations in urban areas, especially those cities suffering from photochemical smog, would be effective to control O3 in a shorter time period. The implementation of ORVR would ensure lower VOC emissions in the long term future.

        "abstract": "The estimation of PM-related mortality is becoming increasingly important. The accuracy of results is largely dependent on the selection of methods for PM exposure assessment and Concentration-Response (C-R) function. In this study, PM observed data from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center, satellite-derived estimation, widely collected geographic and socioeconomic information variables were applied to develop a national satellite-based Land Use Regression model and evaluate PM exposure concentrations within 2013-2015 with the resolution of 1\u202fkm\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fkm. Population weighted concentration declined from 72.52\u202f\u03bcg/m in 2013 to 57.18\u202f\u03bcg/m in 2015. C-R function is another important section of health effect assessment, but most previous studies used the Integrated Exposure Regression (IER) function which may currently underestimate the excess relative risk of exceeding the exposure range in China. A new Shape Constrained Health Impact Function (SCHIF) method, which was developed from a national cohort of 189,793 Chinese men, was adopted to estimate the PM-related premature deaths in China. Results showed that 2.19 million (2013), 1.94 million (2014), 1.65 million (2015) premature deaths were attributed to PM long-term exposure, different from previous understanding around 1.1-1.7 million. The top three provinces of the highest premature deaths were Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, while the least ones were Tibet, Hainan, Qinghai. The proportions of premature deaths caused by specific diseases were 53.2% for stroke, 20.5% for ischemic heart disease, 16.8% for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 9.5% for lung cancer. IER function was also used to calculate PM-related premature deaths with the same exposed level used in SCHIF method, and the comparison of results indicated that IER had made a much lower estimation with less annual amounts around 0.15-0.5 million premature deaths within 2013-2015.",

Currently, none of the single technologies used to measure or estimate concentrations of pollutants can provide sufficient resolved exposure data. Land use regression (LUR) models were developed to combine ground-based measurements, satellite remote sensing (SRS) and air quality model (AQM), together with geographic and local source related spatial inputs, to generate high resolution pollution maps for both PM and NO in Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. Four sets of LUR models (LUR without SRS or AQM, with SRS only, with AQM only, and with both SRS and AQM), all including local traffic emissions and land use variables, were compared to evaluate the contribution of SRS and AQM data to the performance of LUR models in PRD region. For NO, the annual model with SRS estimate performed best, explaining 60.5% of the spatial variation. For PM, the annual model with traditional predictor variables without SRS or AQM estimates showed the best performance, explaining 88.4% of the spatial variation. Pollution surfaces at 200\u00a0m*200\u00a0m resolution were generated according to the best performed models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   After having implemented numerous regulations, e.g., coercive policies on vehicle use and purchase, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find further potential to control vehicle emissions in Beijing, as the air quality is still poor. This research provides a different approach for policy-makers to reduce vehicle emissions by managing demand. We found that parents ferrying their children to and from school is an important but long-neglected contributor to traffic congestion and vehicle emissions. This phenomenon is very common in China because of the social culture. In this research, parallel tests during both the school season and the non-school season were adopted, and emissions in both seasons were calculated based on travel demand and emission models. The results revealed that emissions factors (in g/km) for criteria pollutants and CO 2  increased by over 10% during rush hours during the school season due to traffic condition deterioration compared with non-school season. Daily HC, CO, NO x , PM and CO 2  emissions from the passenger car fleet were 8.3%, 7.8%, 6.4%, 6.3% and 6.5% higher compared with those during the non-school season, respectively. These differences are greater than the total vehicular emission reduction by other control measures in 2014 in Beijing. For policy makers, providing safe and efficient ways to ferry children would be a useful and harmonious strategy for future vehicle emission control.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Currently, the emission inventory of vehicular volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is one of those with the largest errors and uncertainties due to suboptimal estimation methods and the lack of first-hand basic data. In this study, an updated speciated emission inventory of VOCs and an estimation of intermediate-volatility\u00a0organic\u00a0compounds (IVOCs) from vehicles in China at the provincial level for the year of 2015 are developed based on a set of state-of-the-art methods and an abundance of local measurement data. Activity data for light-duty vehicles are derived from trajectories of more than 70  000 cars for 1\u00a0year. The annual mileage of trucks are calculated from reported data by more than 2\u00a0million trucks in China. The emission profiles are updated using measurement data. Vehicular tailpipe emissions (VTEs) and four types of vehicular evaporation emissions (VEEs), including refueling, hot soak, diurnal and running loss, are taken into account. Results show that the total vehicular VOC emissions in China are 4.21  Tg (with a 95  % confidence interval range from 2.90 to 6.54  Tg) and the IVOC emissions are 200.37  Gg in 2015. VTEs are still the predominant contributor, while VEEs are responsible for 39.20  % of VOC emissions. The control of VEEs is yet to be optimized in China. Among VTEs, passenger vehicles emissions have the largest share (49.86  %), followed by trucks (28.15  %) and motorcycles (21.99  %). Among VEEs, running loss is the largest contributor (81.05  %). For both VTEs and VEEs, Guangdong, Shandong and Jiangsu province are three of the highest, with a respective contribution of 10.66, 8.85 and 6.54  % to the total amounts of VOCs from vehicles. 97 VOC species are analyzed in this VOC emission inventory.  i -Pentane, toluene and formaldehyde are found to be the most abundant species in Chinau0027s vehicular VOC emissions. The estimated IVOCs are another  inconvenient truth , concluding that precursor emissions for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from vehicles are much larger than previously estimated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In recent years, ground-level ozone pollution in China has become an increasingly prominent problem. This study simulated and analyzed spatiotemporal distribution of ozone and exposure level by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models and monitoring data from 1516 national air quality monitoring stations in China during 2015. The simulation results show that the Sichuan Basin, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region had relatively high average annual concentrations of ozone. The regions with more than 10% nonattainment days of 160\u00a0\u03bcg/m 3  (daily maximum 8-h) are mainly concentrated in BTH, Shandong Peninsula and YRD, where large seasonal variations were also found. Exposure levels were calculated based on population data and simulated ozone concentrations. The cumulative population exposed to daily maximum 8-h concentration greater than or equal to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/m 3  was 816.04 million, 61.17% of the total. Three methods were used to estimate the mortality of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) attributable to ozone. A comparative study using different exposure concentrations and threshold concentrations found large variations among these methods, although they were all peer-reviewed methods. The estimated mortality of COPD caused by ozone in China in 2015 ranged from 55341 to 80280, which mainly distributed in Beijing, Shandong, Henan, Hubei and Sichuan Province, the YRD and PRD region.",

The molecular morphology of GPP \u2162 -a was observed under an atomic force microscope (AFM). The results showed that the GPP \u2162 -a molecules were of irregular \"peak\"-like aggregates in solution which were changed to \"ring\"-like aggregates with different diameters after heat; the \"peak\"- and \"ring\"-shaped structure was associated with external factors including temperature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Holey graphene/polypyrrole hybrid aerogels (HGPAs) with three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure have been fabricated by freeze-drying holey graphene/polypyrrole hydrogels, which are assembled by using holey graphene (HG) nanosheets and polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles as assembling primitives. The as-prepared HGPAs materials show an interconnected and stable 3D porous network, and PPy nanoparticles uniformly embedded in the aerogel prevent the restacking of holey graphene (HG) nanosheets. The unique hierarchical porous structure and synergistic effect between PPy nanoparticles and HG nanosheets make HGPA hybrid aerogel electrode with a mass ratio of PPy/HGO\u00a0=\u00a00.75 exhibits high specific capacitance (418\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121 ) at a current density of 0.5\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 , extremely outstanding rate capability (80%) at various current densities from 0.5 to 20\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121  and good cycling performance (74%) after 2000 cycles in 1.0\u00a0M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the effect of the PPy nanoparticle sizes in HGPAs on their electrochemical properties is also investigated, and PPy nanoparticles with relatively larger sizes are favorable of the good capacitive performance for the obtained electrodes. The facile and efficient preparation method for HGPAs electrodes may be developed for preparing other holey graphene-based hybrid aerogels with structure-controllable nanostructures.",

HRGO-650 was obtained by soaking graphene oxide in a 0.5 M H3PO4 solution for 12 h followed by calcining it at 650 \u00b0C for 2 h in N2. The loose curling manganese oxide nanosheets are reassembled on the surface of the HRGO-650 fiber freely, causing the close contact between the manganese oxide nanosheets and the graphene nanosheets. The prepared \u03b4-MnO2(4.0)/HRGO fiber electrode shows a larger specific capacitance (245 F g\u22121) at a current density of 1 A g\u22121 in the 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. An all-solid-state fiber supercapacitor was assembled by two intertwined \u03b4-MnO2(4.0)/HRGO fiber electrodes, both of which are solidified in a H3PO4\u2013polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel electrolyte. This all-solid-state \u03b4-MnO2(4.0)/HRGO fiber supercapacitor not only shows good flexibility, but also gives enhanced capacitive performance. The optimal all-solid-state \u03b4-MnO2(4.0)/HRGO fiber supercapacitor obtains a high area-specific capacitance (16.3\u201316.7 mF cm\u22122) at a current density of 0.05 mA cm\u22122, enhanced rate capability (64% capacitance retention from 0.05\u20130.6 mA cm\u22122), and relative good stability (80% of initial capacitance values after 1000 cycles). This method is expected to improve the conductivity and capacitance for all-solid-state carbon-based fiber supercapacitor with good flexibility and light weight.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Plant roots play a critical role in plant-soil-microbe interactions that occur in the rhizosphere. X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) has been proven to be an effective tool for non-invasive root imaging and analysis. A combination of XCT, open-source software, and in-house developed code was used to non-invasively image a prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis) specimen, segment the root data to obtain a 3D image of the root structure, and extract quantitative information from the 3D data, respectively. Based on the explicitly-resolved root structure, pore-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were applied to numerically investigate the root-soil-groundwater system. The plant root conductivity, soil hydraulic conductivity and transpiration rate were shown to control the groundwater distribution. The coupled imaging-modeling approach demonstrates a realistic platform to investigate rhizosphere flow processes and would be feasible to provide useful information linked to upscaled models.",

In the present study, we found that GCs decreased LPS-mediated TBK1 activation and the expression of IFN-\u03b2, RANTES and CXCL-10; however, poly(dA:dT)-induced TBK1 activity and cytokine expression were not affected by GCs treatment. Furthermore, GCs decreased the expression of key autophagy-related genes (ATGs), including ATG5, ATG7 and ATG12, and inhibited autophagy in macrophages after LPS stimulation. However, GCs had no effect on poly(dA:dT)-mediated autophagy and ATG expression in macrophages. Collectively, this study demonstrates that GCs inhibit the TLR4-mediated innate immune response, but do not affect the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway. This provides new insights into the immunomodulatory mechanisms of GCs in macrophages, which may provide useful information for the clinical use of GCs in treating chronic inflammatory disorders.",

We identified three HLA-DRB1*09:01-restricted CD4+ T-cell epitopes derived from the dominant secreted MTB antigens 38kDa (Rv3804c) and Ag85A (Rv0934). The antigens were screened for epitopes by in silico prediction programs and analysis of IFN-\u03b3 induction in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from TB patients. In response to three of the high-affinity predicted epitopes derived from 38kDa and Ag85A, CD4+ T cells from HLA-DRB1*09:01 TB patients were stimulated to produce IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. The three epitopes were also found to induce the proliferation of CD4+ T cells by CFSE diluted assays. These HLA-DRB1*09:01-restricted CD4+ T-cell epitopes facilitate analysis of the role of 38kDa- and Ag85A-specific T cells in MTB infection and pave way for the design of vaccines against tuberculosis.This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Chronic administration of glucocorticoids has been shown to render individuals highly susceptible to mycobacterial infection and lead to reactivation of latent bacilli. However, the effect of glucocorticoids on innate anti-mycobacterial defense, especially in macrophages remains largely unknown. Here, we found that glucocorticoids inhibited the innate immune response, antimicrobial nitric oxide production and autophagy in mycobacteria-challenged macrophages. Meanwhile, maturation and acidification of mycobacterial phagosomes were attenuated in RAW264.7 cells after glucocorticoids treatment. Consequently, we observed a glucocorticoid-induced increase in the survival of intracellular mycobacteria in both primary macrophages and cell lines. Glucocorticoids treatment decreased the activation of TBK1 kinase, which promotes the maturation of autophagosomes. Inhibition of TBK1 also decreased the production of nitric oxide. Furthermore, several autophagy-related genes were down-regulated, while activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was increased after glucocorticoids treatment, which may account for autophagy inhibition during mycobacterial infection. Restoration of autophagy with the agonist rapamycin abolished glucocorticoid-mediated enhancement of mycobacterial survival, suggesting that glucocorticoids blocked anti-mycobacterial defense via autophagy inhibition. Collectively, this study demonstrates that glucocorticoids impair innate antimicrobial autophagy and promote mycobacterial survival in macrophages, which is a novel mechanism for glucocorticoid-mediated immunosuppression. Our findings may provide important clues for tuberculosis prevention.",

        "abstract": "The tight linkage between photosynthesis (A) and soil respiration (R) has been verified in many terrestrial ecosystems. However, it remains unclear whether this linkage occurs in desert ecosystems, where water is considered an important trigger of carbon cycling. A field experiment was performed under seven simulated rainfall amounts (0, 3, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 40\u202fmm) with two co-existing desert plants (Reaumuria soongorica and Nitraria sphaerocarpa) in June (early growing season, EGS) and August (middle growing season, MGS) in 2016. A, R, predawn water potential (\u03a8), soil temperature (T) and soil moisture (S) were measured for each treatment or control plot for 3\u202fweeks. Our objective was to examine the effects of rainfall pattern on R and physiological responses of the two plants and the relationships between R and biotic and abiotic factors. No obvious variations in \u03a8 or A were found under small rainfall events. However, when the rainfall amount exceeded 10\u202fmm, both plants responded strongly, and the response patterns of R showed trends similar to those of A, which varied between species and seasons. Moreover, rain additions of 3-40\u202fmm significantly increased R, and the relative changes in R (\u0394R) of both species were much larger in the EGS than in the MGS. Importantly, abiotic factors may have controlled the variations in R under small rain events while A played a more important role in regulating the variations in R when the rainfall amount exceeded 10\u202fmm for both species, suggest that the rainfall pattern-driven changes in R composition interact with physiological activity and abiotic factors to regulate the response of R to rainfall variability in desert ecosystems. Thus, climate change in the coming decades may lead to carbon sequestration by desert plants, which may cause desert ecosystems to act as carbon sinks.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing temperature and intensified drought, global climate change has profound impacts on tree growth in temperate regions, which consequently regulates terrestrial-atmosphere biogeochemical processes and biophysical feedbacks. Thus, increasing numbers of studies have addressed the long-term annual trends in tree growth and their response to climate change at diverse spatial scales. However, the potential divergence in tree growth trends and growth variability (represented by coefficient of variance) in different seasons across large-scale climate gradients remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the tree growth trends and growth variability in different seasons across diverse drought conditions in forested regions over northeastern China during the period 1982\u20132015, using both remote sensing observations and in situ tree-ring measurements. We found clear seasonal divergence in tree growth trends during 1982\u20132015, and the apparent increase was mainly observed in spring and autumn, attributed mainly to the increase in spring temperature and autumn solar radiation, respectively, but not in summer. The magnitudes of increasing trends in tree growth decrease with the increase of the multi-year average dryness index (MAI) in semi-arid areas (1.5 u003c MAI u003c 4.0) in all seasons. We further revealed that the interannual variability in tree growth was much larger in the semi-arid regions than in the humid and semi-humid regions in all seasons, and tree growth variability was significantly and negatively correlated with the variations in temperature and water deficit. Our findings improve our understanding of seasonal divergence in tree growth trends and provide new insights into spatial patterns in forest vulnerability in a warmer and drier climate.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Canopy conductance (G c ) largely regulates carbon/water cycling and land\u2013atmosphere interactions, but quantifying G c  using eddy flux data is limited by the difficulty of partitioning plant transpiration (T) and surface evaporation (E). We introduced an underlying water use efficiency (uWUE) method to partition evapotranspiration (ET) in an oasis maize ecosystem, and cross\u2013compared with the Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) model, the lysimeter and isotope measurements. We then estimated surface conductance (G s ) by ET and G c  by T partitioned using the uWUE method, followed by a performance evaluation on the Jarvis model parameterized with both G s  and G c . The results showed that T/ET estimated by the uWUE method was close to the isotope method in the peak growing season of 2012, it showed similar seasonal variations with the lysimeter/eddy covariance method and the SW model throughout this growing season. Daily T partitioned by the uWUE method was in good agreement with the SW model from 2012 to 2015 (r 2 \u2009=\u20090.91). Additionally, G c  had more significant seasonal variations than G s . The Jarvis model parameterized with G c  exhibited superior performance than those with G s . Our study suggests that the uWUE method can exclude influences of nonstomatal conductances, and will have great potential to provide more reasonable parameterization for simulation of plant stomata.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  The alpine region is important in riverine and watershed ecosystems as a contributor of freshwater, providing and stimulating specific habitats for biodiversity. In parallel, recent climate change, human activities and other perturbations may disturb hydrological processes and eco-functions, creating the need for next-generation observational and modeling approaches to advance a predictive understanding of such processes in the alpine region. However, several formidable challenges, including the cold and harsh climate, high altitude and complex topography, inhibit complete and consistent data collection where/when needed, which hinders the development of remote sensing technologies and alpine hydrological models. The current study presents a suite of datasets consisting of long-term hydrometeorological, snow cover and frozen ground data for investigating watershed science and functions from an integrated, distributed and multiscale observation network in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in China. Gap-free meteorological and hydrological data were monitored from an observation network connecting a group of automatic meteorological stations (AMSs). In addition, to capture snow accumulation and ablation processes, snow cover properties were collected from a snow observation superstation using state-of-the-art techniques and instruments. High-resolution soil physics datasets were also obtained to capture the freeze-thaw processes from a frozen ground observation superstation. The updated datasets were released to scientists with multidisciplinary backgrounds ( i.e. , cryosphere science, hydrology, and meteorology), and they are expected to serve as a testing platform to provide accurate forcing data and validate and evaluate remote sensing products and hydrological models for a broader community. The datasets are available from the Cold and Arid Regions Science Data Center at Lanzhou  https://doi.org/10.3972/hiwater.001.2019.db .",

        "abstract": "KCl-extractable sediment dissolved organic nitrogen (KS-DON) extracted from sediments near drinking water intakes of six drinking water sources in Taihu Lake in China was partitioned into hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions and high/low molecular weight fractions. The results showed that the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) contents of the extracts ranged from 67.78 to 128.27 mg/kg. KS-DON was the main TDN species, accounting for more than 50%, with NH\u2084\u207a-N and NO\u2083-N averaging 30% and 20%, respectively. The molecular weight fractions of <1 kDa accounted for almost half of KS-DON. Hydrophilic compounds accounted for more than 75% of KS-DON. Three fluorescence peaks were identified: soluble microbial byproducts (A); protein-like substances (B); and humic acid-like substances (C). It is concluded that the KS-DON in Taihu Lake sources has higher bioavailability and higher risk of endogenous release. Ecological dredging and establishment of constructed wetlands are possible measures to reduce the release of endogenous nitrogen.",

To assess their ecotoxicity, the effects of these three pharmaceuticals and their mixture on AChE (acetylcholinesterase) activity in the brain, and EROD (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) and SOD (superoxide dismutase) activities in the liver of the freshwater crucian carp  were tested after exposure for 1, 2, 4 and 7 days. The results showed that treatments with 0.002\u207b0.01 mg/L ofloxacin and 0.0008\u207b0.004 mg/L sulfamethoxazole did not significantly change AChE, EROD and SOD activities. AChE activity was significantly inhibited in response to treatment with 0.05mg/L ofloxacin and 0.02mg/L sulfamethoxazole. All three biomarkers were induced significantly in treatments with ibuprofen and the mixture of the three pharmaceuticals at all the tested concentrations. The combined effects of ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen were compared with their isolated effects on the three biomarkers, and the results indicated that exposure to ibuprofen and the mixture at environmentally relevant concentrations could trigger adverse impacts on .

        "abstract": "Batch experiments were completed to assess the sludge reduction of the metabolic uncoupler 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCS). The effects of various TCS concentrations on sludge yield were evaluated and the mechanisms associated with sludge reduction were assessed. We discovered that TCS addition resulted in a reduction in sludge. Furthermore, a low dose of TCS (\u22643 mg/L) resulted in a slight reduction in the efficiency of the wastewater treatment system, while >3 mg/L TCS reduced matrix removal efficiency, with an especially remarkable inhibition effect on ammonia removal. An increase in TCS addition was associated with a gradual decrease in both the electron transport system (ETS) activity and the specific cellular ATP (SATP) in the TCS system. It was demonstrated that TCS plays an important role in metabolic uncoupling. However, with the addition of TCS, both contents and compositions were increased, and the protein content increased more than polysaccharide production in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). At TCS concentrations of \u22643 mg/L, DNA content was stable, but it increased rapidly from 4.97 mg/L to 15.34 mg/L as the TCS concentration was elevated from 6 mg/L to 12 mg/L. This implied that the mechanisms of sludge reduction were different for different TCS concentrations, including uncoupling metabolism, maintenance metabolism and lysis-cryptic growth.",

        "abstract": "This study focusses on the novel synthesis of silver and strontium modified TiO2 nanocomposite through a sol\u2013gel method, which was then utilized for visible light degradation of EE2 and hydrogen production for the first time. Results indicated that co-doping of strontium and silver in the lattice of TiO2 could remarkably narrow the band gap (2.89 eV) for efficient visible light activity, as indicated by UV-DRS, PL and photocurrent experiment results. The obtained nanocomposite was further characterized by various techniques including XRD, TEM, and XPS analysis. Furthermore, the well characterized photocatalyst was investigated for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. The hydrogen production rate of double atom doped TiO2 (Sr/Ag\u2013TiO2, 49.4 \u03bcmol h\u22121) is 2.6 times higher than that of single atom dopant (Ag\u2013TiO2, 19.6 \u03bcmol h\u22121) nanocomposite. The plausible degradation pathway of EE2 during the photocatalytic process was investigated by LC-ESI/MS analysis. Additionally, to understand the toxicity of degraded metabolites and EE2, phytotoxicity testing was carried out on two common seeds, V. radiata and P. vulgaris., and 30% and 40% germination rate was noticed for seeds exposed to 50 ppm concentration of EE2 in V. radiata and P. vulgaris respectively, while 100% was noticed in seeds exposed to degraded metabolites, which revealed the less toxic nature of degraded metabolites compared to pure EE2. In addition, substantial growth rate was also observed in the roots and shoots of the seeds treated with the degraded metabolites compared to pure EE2. Therefore, the present study demonstrates the detoxification of EE2 and evolution of hydrogen under visible light, and would greatly help in evaluation and extenuation of the environmental risk of EE2 for water reuse and the generation of clean energy.",

        "abstract": "Background: It is difficult to heal when damage or pathological changes occurred due to the limited self-repair ability. Recently, researchers have paid close attention to thymosin \u03b2 4 (T \u03b2 4) in promoting wound healing, which designates a direction for the pharmaprojects on wound healing. Objective: To study the mechanisms of recombinant T \u03b2 4 accelerates skin wound healing in rats by regulation expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Design, Time and Setting: The randomized controlled animal study based on genes was performed at the Anatomy Department Nankai University School of Medicine from March 2007 to January 2008. Materials: T\u03b2 4 was supplied by Beijing Northland Biotech.Co., Ltd. Methods: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were selected and prepared for full thickness skin defect animal models by using self-made puncher with 8 mm diameter on the each side of vertebral column at the costovertebral angle, then divided into the control and T \u03b2 4 40, 120, 360 mg/L groups randomly (n=15). 50 \u03bc L T\u03b2 4 saline were injected on the surface of wound immediately at 7:00 am and 7:00 pm every day after models preparation. Main Outcome Measures: Histological changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and Marson staining at 2, 4, 7 days after models preparation, VEGF and bFGF expression were detected by immunohistochemical method. Results: Immunohistochemistry staining showed that compared with the control group, capillaries, VEGF, collagen fiber and reticular fiber were increased with regular arrangements in T \u03b2 4 groups, especially that of 120 mg/L T \u03b2 4 group. The expression of VEGF reached a peak level at 4 days after treating with T \u03b2 4, and decreased at 7 days, however, the expression of VEGF remained higher in the 120 mg/L T \u03b2 4 group than 40 and 360 mg/L T \u03b2 4 groups (P < 0.05-0.01). The bFGF expression elevated at 2 days after modeling, and then gradually decreased at 4, 7 days in the 120 mg/L T\u03b2 4 group (P < 0.01). Conclusion: 120 mg/L T \u03b2 4 can regulate the high expression of VEGF and bFGF sustainable and stablely, which can accelerate skin wound healing by the promoting vascular regeneration and proliferation of granulation tissue and bFGF at early stage, and down-regulated the expression of VEGF, inhibit over-expression of bFGF at the later stage of healing.",

Aimed at the defect of Carbide Twist Drillbit (CTD) when drilling on CFRP, a new type of drillbit, which is called Drilling-Reaming Composite Drillbit (DRCD), was designed and used to drill holes on a plate of CFRP. Through experimental study and analysis, and compared with CTD, we found that drilling with DRCD have higher dimension accuracy and better surface quality when drilling on CFRP, and it has minor wear on its cutting edges and its tool life at least ten times that of CTD. So we draw conclusion that DRCD with high wear resistance and good stability is more suitable for drilling CFRP. \u00a9 (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

AChE activity was significantly inhibited by caffeine (\u22650.4 mg/l), sulfamethoxazole (\u22650.4 mg/l) and their mixtures (\u22650.048 mg/l) during all exposure periods, and obvious concentration-response and time-response relationships were obtained. EROD, GST and SOD activities were significantly increased by individual compounds and mixtures in most cases. GST induction exhibited bell-shaped concentration-response curves. Serum VTG was significantly induced by 2 mg/l of caffeine, 10 mg/l of sulfamethoxazole and the mixtures at concentrations \u22651.2 mg/l. In general, the two pharmaceuticals induced similar biological responses. The joint effect of caffeine/sulfamethoxazole was additive with regard to AChE and GST activity variation and was antagonistic with regard to EROD and SOD induction. The results indicated that multiple biomarker response method might be a useful tool for describing an integrated toxicological effect of chemicals. VTG induction suggested that caffeine and sulfamethoxazole may cause a slightly feminization effect.",

Active biomonitoring was conducted in Taihu Lake using transplanted goldfish (Carassius auratus) to determine the contamination by pharmaceuticals and metals and to assess the potential ecological risk. A suite of biomarkers including acetylcholinesterase, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities in fish after 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of exposure in situ, as well as pharmaceuticals and metals in water, were determined during the field exposure period. The results indicate that pharmaceuticals exist mainly in Zhushan Bay and Meiliang Bay, while metals are present mainly in Gong Bay. An integrated biomarker response (IBR) was calculated and used to evaluate the ecological risk of the polluted area of Taihu Lake. It was found that Zhushan Bay might present higher risk to fish, followed by Meiliang Bay. IBR values were in good agreement with copper and caffeine concentrations.",

Nine out of sixteen target compounds were detected in most sampling points at comparable concentrations (1.58-206.95 ng/L). Simultaneously, changes in multi-biomarkers were measured in caged fish for 28 days. The 0HQ results preliminarily indicated that most water areas were at significant risk for adverse effects to aquatic organisms (HQ>10). The prioritisation was then ranked and 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol and 17\u03b2-estradiol were regarded as the greatest hazards. The EIBR, covering multi-biomarkers and their weighting, was applied to field study, and Zhushan Bay was suggested as the most stressful place, followed by Meiliang Bay. The HQ showed significant positive linear correlation with the EIBR (r=0.848, P<0.001), suggesting mutual consistency between the two approaches based on laboratory and field study in ecotoxicological risk assessment.",

The ROX content in different tissues was quantified using UPLC/MS/MS. The liver exhibited the highest ROX concentration followed by the bile, gills, and muscle tissues. After 15d of exposure to different concentrations of ROX, the bioconcentration factors were 2.15-38.0 in the liver, 0.950-20.7 in the bile, 0.0506-19.7 in the gill, and 0.0439-13.8 in the muscle; these results were comparable to the estimated BCF values. The metabolites formed in the bile were identified based on metabolic identification in human bile. Additionally, the biomarkers, including acetylcholinesterase in the brain, as well as 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and superoxide dismutase in the liver changed significantly after 5, 10, 15, and 20d of exposure (P<0.05). Our results suggest that ROX can accumulate and be metabolized in fish; therefore, interactions between ROX or its metabolites and the biological systems may induce biochemical disturbances in fish.",

        "abstract": "Inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are increasingly used as therapy for pediatric patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The uncertainty over the efficacy and safety of mTOR inhibitor therapy for the treatment of pediatric patients with TSC emphasizes the necessity for a synthesis of existing evidence. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of mTOR inhibitor therapy for the treatment of pediatric patients with TSC. The PubMed, EmBase and Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched, and studies of mTOR inhibitor therapy and non-mTOR inhibitor therapy in pediatric patients with TSC (&amp;lt;18 years old) were selected. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. There was evidence of a significantly increased response rate in pediatric patients with TSC treated with mTOR inhibitor therapy compared with those treated with non-mTOR inhibitor therapy (odds ratio, 24.71; 95% confidence interval, 7.46-81.72; P&amp;lt;0.001). The majority of studies reported few adverse events. There was an increased incidence of mouth ulceration, stomatitis, convulsion and pyrexia in pediatric patients with TSC treated with mTOR inhibitor therapy. In conclusion, mTOR inhibitor therapy is an efficacious and safe treatment for pediatric patients with TSC.",

Animal behavior, morphological changes, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression levels, and CO content in rat cortex cells were determined. Results demonstrated that EA treatment decreased the slope behavior and increased the overhang behavior of perinatal rats. The treatment also decreased the number of positive cells. The activator and inhibitor of CBS aggravated and remitted the hypoxic damage in cortex cells, respectively. EA treatment decreased CBS expression level and increased HO-1 and HIF-1\u03b1 expression levels in perinatal rat cortex cells. Compared with the control groups, the CO content of cortex cells in the EA treatment group significantly increased (**p < 0.01). We hypothesized that EA treatment increases cortical CO content to protect against hypoxic damage via the hydrogen sulfide/CBS-CO/HO-1-HIF-1\u03b1 system. This study provided a significant reference for EA therapy and cued a novel protective mechanism for cerebral palsy.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the therapeutic effect and safety of rapamycin in treatment of children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) complicated with epilepsy.This was an open-label, prospective, self-controlled study. From Sep. 2011 to Sep. 2013, 52 patients with the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complicated with epilepsy receiving rapamycin treatment for at least 24 weeks were enrolled.Of the 52 children, 34 were male and 18 female. The median age at onset of epilepsy was 4.8 months (4 days-49 months), the median age for treatment with rapamycin was 27 months (4.5-172.5 months). Ten children had a family history of TSC. In 24 children TSC gene detection was carried out, among whom TSC1 mutation was detected in 4 cases and TSC2 mutation in 20. Before rapamycin therapy, 59.62%, (31/52) patients took more than 3 antiepileptic drugs, of whom 10 cases even took more than 5 kinds of antiepileptic drugs. Fifty-two patients received rapamycin treatment for 24 weeks, seizure free rate was 25.00% (13 cases), the total effective rate was 73.08% (38 cases); 31 cases received treatment for 48 weeks, seizure free 6 cases, total effective 23 cases; 17 cases accepted treatment for 72 weeks, seizure free 5 cases, total effective 13 cases; 12 cases received treatment for 96 weeks, seizure free 3 cases, total effective 9 cases. With the decrease of seizure attacks, use of antiepileptic drug types were reduced simultaneously, they had a negative correlation. Before rapamycin therapy, the average frequency of seizures was 70.27 times/d, the number of antiepileptic drug kinds was 1.30. After 24, 48, 72, 96 weeks' treatment, the average seizure frequency was reduced to 1.94-2.80 times /d and the antiepileptic drugs were reduced to 0.83-0.97 kinds. On every visit during the follow-up, blood and urine routine tests, liver and kidney function test showed no abnormality in the 52 cases. The drug dosage was 1 mg/(m(2)\u00d7d), average 0.7 mg/d (0.35-1.20 mg/d). Blood concentrations of rapamycin remained below 10 \u00b5g/L (average 6.5 \u00b5g/L). The main side effect was oral ulcer which happened in 23.08% (12/52). The oral ulcer would disappeared 2-3 days later. 17.31% (9/52 cases) had upper respiratory infection.Rapamycin was effective in children with tuberous sclerosis and epilepsy with few adverse reactions. The daily dose of rapamycin for children patients is 1 mg/m(2), which has a certain effect on seizures and a good safety profile.",

In the present study, the clinical history and auxiliary examination results of 18 patients who developed infantile spasms several months after neonatal hypoglycemia were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 666 patients with infantile spasms admitted to two pediatric centers between January 2008 and October 2012, 18 patients developed infantile spasms after being diagnosed with neonatal hypoglycemia, defined as a whole blood glucose concentration of <2.6 mmol/l. These patients developed infantile spasms from between 2 and 10 months (mean, 4.9 months) following the diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia. All 18 patients had abnormal electroencephalographic findings with either classical or modified hypsarrhythmia. Upon examination using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 10 patients (55.6%) exhibited abnormalities. The MRI results principally showed a disproportional involvement of parietal and occipital cortices and sub-cortical white matter lesions. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that neonatal hypoglycemic brain injury is associated with the subsequent development of infantile spasms.",

Genetic testing is crucial in clarifying and diagnosing different types of MPS diseases. In this paper we report a novel IDS nonsense mutation resulting in MPS II in several patients from a Chinese family.IDS enzyme activity, polymerase chain reaction, and DNA sequencing were performed to confirm the diagnosis of MPS II.Three patients had no detectable IDS activity. Two genetic tests revealed a novel IDS nonsense mutation (c.1030G>T, p.E344X) inherited from their mothers. The nonsense mutation shortened the peptide chain from 550 to 344 amino acids, which is believed to be a disease-causing mutation.MPS II is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs depends on the carrier status of the mother. Genetic testing is necessary to identify disease-causing mutation. With this information, carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk become possible.",

        "abstract": "Hyperventilation can cause respiratory alkalosis by exhaling CO2, and is often used to confirm diagnosis of absence epilepsy. CO2 has long been known for its anticonvulsant properties since the 1920s. In this pilot study, we aimed to determine whether inhaling medical carbogen containing 5% CO2 and 95% O2 can suppress hyperventilation-induced absence seizures and spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs). We examined 12 patients whose absence seizures were induced by hyperventilation using video electroencephalographic recording for at least 4h. The patients were asked to hyperventilate for 3 min while breathing the following gases: (1) room air (12 patients); (2) carbogen (12 patients); and (3) 100% O2 (8 patients). Eight out of twelve patients were also examined in room air through pretreatment with carbogen for 3 min before the 3 min hyperventilation. Compared with hyperventilation in room air, hyperventilation supplemented with 5% CO2 had the following effects: (a) decrease in the number and duration of seizures; (b) prolonged appearance of epileptic discharges; and (c) reduction in the number and duration of SWDs (P<0.001). However, pretreatment with 5% CO2 and 100% O2 supplement did not yield similar effects. We demonstrated that 5% CO2 could suppress hyperventilation-induced absence seizures and SWDs, supporting the claim that 5% CO2 is an effective anticonvulsant agent. Our pilot study provides clinical basis that 5% CO2 inhalation could be a therapeutic approach for hyperventilation-related seizures.",

However, few studies reported the effect of combined application of RY10-4 and chemotherapeutic drugs against cancer cells with multidrug resistance (MDR). In this study, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is reported to mediate MDR to anti-cancer drugs, was proved to be overexpressed in the adriamycin (ADR)-resistant human breast cancer cells, namely MCF-7/ADR cells. Furthermore, RY10-4 application resulted in a downregulation of P-gp in MCF-7/ADR cells, thus leading to higher chemosensitivity to ADR. Our study further demonstrated that the MDR phenomenon was under the control of the PI3K/Akt/NF-\u03baB pathway, which was suppressed by RY10-4, leading to MDR reversal effects in MCF-7/ADR cells. In vivo, MCF-7/ADR cells were effectively suppressed by the combined ADR/RY10-4 treatment compared with the ADR-alone treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrated that RY10-4 reverses the MDR phenotype in MCF-7/ADR cells by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/NF-\u03baB pathway.",

Autologous nerve transplantation is considered as the gold standard repair technique when primary suture is impossible; nevertheless, this method is far from ideal. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a 5\u03b1-reduced derivative of testosterone, on the recovery of peripheral nerve injury treated with autologous nerve transplantation. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 10-mm right side sciatic nerve reversed autologous nerve transplantation and randomly divided into groups that received DHT or DHT\u2009+\u2009flutamide (an androgen receptor blocker) daily for 8 weeks after operation. Our results demonstrated that DHT could speed up the rate of axonal regeneration and increase the expression of myelin protein zero (P0) in autograft reversal sciatic nerves. Thus, our study provided new insights into improving the prognosis of patients with long gap peripheral nerve defects.",

The most common approved cause of MDR in cancer tissues is the over-expression of P-gp. At present, a novel potent anti-tumor compound RY10-4 has been synthesized by our team, which has a similar structure close to protoapigenone. We chose MCF-7/ADR cells, an adriamycin (ADR) - selected human breast tumor cell line with the MDR phenotype, to study the anticancer features of this novel compound in our experiments. In cytotoxicity and apoptosis tests, it was shown that RY10-4 significantly inhibited cell growth, induced apoptosis, potentiated ADR cytotoxicity and restored chemotherapy sensitivity in the MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, our results suggested that RY10-4 reversed MDR partially by down-regulation of P-gp and MDR1 expressions in the MCF-7/ADR cell line. Besides, it is seen that RY10-4 could reduce the intracellular ATP level. Our studies give the theoretical basis for the possible clinical applications of RY10-4 alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of MDR tumors.",

Low temperature reactions are important for the partially premixed combustion. In the current study, a self-adaptive strategy is introduced to predict the motoring pressure by means of an equivalent isentropic index. The start of the low temperature reactions is detected when the pressure difference between the measured pressure and the predicted pressure is higher than a threshold value. Experimental results show that the maximum variation between the measured and the predicted motoring pressure before the top dead center is less than 0.02\u202fbar. It is also demonstrated that the presented detection method is able to detect the start of the low temperature reactions under different engine operating conditions with varying injection timing, injection duration, number of injections and exhaust gas recirculation rate.",

        "abstract": "Partially premixed combustion with low octane fuel aims to reduce NOx and soot emission simultaneously without fuel consumption penalty. Cylinder pressure based combustion phase control is an essential technology for partially premixed combustion. A novel closed-loop combustion phase control strategy for multiple combustion modes is proposed in the current study. The combustion modes are classified into three basic categories based on injection patterns and heat release stages: (1) with only one heat release stage; (2) with two separated heat release stages; (3) with two overlapped heat release stages. Crank angle when 50% fuel is consumed (CA50) is chosen as the combustion phase indicator for the first case. Start of combustion (SOC) of each heat release stage is the combustion phase indicator for the second case. Both SOC and CA50 are the combustion phase indicators for the third case. Each combustion phase is closed-loop controlled by a proportional\u2013integral (PI) controller with the timing adjustments of the corresponding injection. The control strategy is verified under different operating conditions in a 1.9 L light duty diesel engine fueled by gasoline-diesel mixture (volumetric 70% gasoline, 30% diesel). The experimental results show that the control strategy is able to control the combustion phase, reduce cylinder to cylinder variations as well as cycle to cycle variations under the operating conditions with exhaust gas circulation (EGR) rates of 10% and 15%.

        "abstract": "Partially premixed combustion aims to reduce NOx and particulate matter emission without fuel consumption penalty. Low temperature heat release (LTHR) is an important process to be investigated. A novel motoring pressure prediction algorithm based on variable polytropic exponents was introduced and utilized to estimate average heat transfer coefficient as well as heat dissipation for real-time applications. A series of parameters, such as start of combustion (SOC) of LTHR, crank angle of 50% heat released (CA50) during LTHR, duration of LTHR and heat amount of LTHR, were further analyzed under different engine operation conditions. The results demonstrated that: (1) the absolute motoring pressure prediction error was below 0.5\u202fbar with a relative error below 4%; (2) the average heat released during LTHR was about 40\u201365\u202fJ, and the mass burned was about 1\u20133% of the total mass burned; (3) CA50 of LTHR was more stable than SOC of LTHR, and was a better indicator for real-time combustion phase control; (4) similar combustion phase and heat amount of LTHR could be reached by adjusting the timing of the third injection regardless the difference in timing of the second injection; (5) the combustion phase and heat amount of LTHR could be controlled by the duration of the second injection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The behaviors of livestock on farms are the primary representatives of animal welfare, health conditions and social interactions. Measuring behavior quantitatively in an automatic detection system on computer vision provides valuable behavioral information in an efficient and noninvasive way compared with manual observations or sensing techniques. Lactating sow postures, which are the crucial indicator of maternal evaluation, provide fundamental information for studying the maternal behavioral characteristics and regularities. We introduce a detector, Faster R-CNN, on deep learning framework to identify five postures (standing, sitting, sternal recumbency, ventral recumbency and lateral recumbency) and obtain sows accurate location in loose pens. The detection system consists of a Kinect v2 sensor that acquires depth images and a program that identifies sow postures and locates its bounding-boxes. The depth images of testing dataset of a sow were acquired at 5 frames per second in 24\u202fh on the 15th day of postpartum, and training dataset were collected by some different sows. Since the identification performance from RGB images are impacted by the color and illumination variations caused by in-situ heat lamp and day-night cycle, we show that the automatic detection from depth images could avoid disturbances of the light. We find that the sow spent greater amount of time in recumbency (92.9% at night and 84.1% during the daytime) as compared with standing (0.4% at night and 10.5% during the daytime) and sitting (0.55% at night and 3.4% during the daytime). Statistically, the sow\u2019s activity level is non-uniform in 24-h of a day, and her preferred lying positions is accordant with the pen\u2019s floor design. The posture\u2019s change frequency and average duration are presented. From the estimated general manner of posture change, we find that the sow takes more time in descending body than ascending, which could be a favorable indication of maternal ability with a slow-motion falling to avoid crushing piglets.",

        "abstract": "The aim is to develop a computer vision-based method for automatic recognition of nursing interactions under commercial farm conditions by using spatial and temporal information of nursing behaviour. For spatial information extraction, the spatial distribution between the mother sow and her piglets during nursing was used to detect the possible nursing episodes. Sows were segmented accurately by a fully convolutional network, and udder zones were calculated dynamically by the geometrical properties of the nursing sow and the piglet length. Spatial information from piglets was extracted in the self-adaptive udder zones. For temporal information extraction, to distinguish behaviours similar to nursing, temporal motion information about the intensity of motion and the occupation index was extracted from optical flow of the udder zones. Six sows with 64 piglets, each on different days postpartum, were captured on videos. From these videos, 507 episodes of videos of two sows were selected as training set and 502 episodes of another two sows were used as test set. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity achieved 96.4%, 92.0% and 98.5%, respectively. In addition, our method was used to recognise the nursing behaviour in four extended videos of the two remaining sows. The accuracy achieved reached 97.6% with a sensitivity of 90.9% and with a specificity of 99.2%. The results show that the recognition method designed represents a significant step forward in automatically identifying nursing behaviour in commercial pig farms.",

The first step is the segmentation of the lactating sows from the top-view images using a fully convolutional network (FCN). The second step is the refinement of the coarse output of the FCN using the probability map from the final layer of the FCN and Otsuu0027s thresholding from the hue, saturation, and value colour information. Our segmentation model was trained using 3811 images which were randomly selected from the images of seven pens, and tested on 1085 images which were randomly selected from the images of the remaining 21 pens. The present method provided improved segmentation results compared with SDS, Otsu, MoG, and traditional FCNs. Our method attained a 96.6% mean accuracy rate and 93.0% mean intersection over union. The experiment revealed that our method was suitable for accurate and fast-image segmentation for lactating sows, laying a foundation for the precision husbandry of individual lactating sows.",

Density functional theory calculations are used to construct a complete catalytic cycle of this process paying special attention to the coordination geometries and redox states of copper.

Our calculations also suggest that the reoxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) requires the addition of both NO and O2. The production of a second equivalent of N2 during the oxidation half-cycle proceeds through a peroxynitrite intermediate to form a Cu\u2013nitrite intermediate, which may react with an acid, either HNO2 or NH4+ to close the catalytic cycle.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Elastic modulus and hardness of human cortical bones and cancellous bones that contained different moisture levels (20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60%) were measured with nanoindentation with different peak loads and loading rates. Cortical bones with 20% and 60% moisture were tested with 30 nm, 40 nm, and 50 nm peak loads at 6 nm/s, 8 nm/s, and 10 nm/s loading rates, respectively. Cancellous bones with 5% or 40% moisture percentages were tested with 600 \u03bcN, 750 \u03bcN, and 1000 \u03bcN peak loads at 200 \u03bcN/s, 250 \u03bcN/s, and 333 \u03bcN/s loading rates, respectively. RESULTS Under the same loading condition, specimens with higher moisture contents showed decreased elastic modulus and hardness. Under different loading conditions, the loading modes had little influence on elastic modulus and hardness of cortical bone and cancellous bone with low moisture, but had significant influence on specimens with higher moistures. CONCLUSIONS The elastic modulus and bone hardness were affected by the moisture content and the loading conditions in cortical and cancellous bones with high hydration condition but not in those with low hydration condition.",

The calculated adsorption energies (E) of short peptides on the clean Mg(0001) surface are in the range of -1.73 to -2.80 eV per dipeptide, and -3.24 eV for RGD. The short peptides prefer to bond to Mg atoms at the surface by the O and N anions in their functional groups. For the clean Mg(0001) surface, the E of the short peptides are exclusively dominated by the number of functional groups binding to the surface. However, for the surface of the Mg-Zn alloy (1% Zn), the adsorption of the peptides is clearly enhanced (by about 0.3 eV per peptide) due to the enhanced N-Mg bond and the electrostatic interactions between the doped Zn at the surface and the backbone chains of the peptides. Furthermore, the attractive interactions are increased with the increase of doped Zn contents (up to 3%). In contrast, for the surfaces of Mg-Y (1% Y) and Mg-Nd (1% Nd) alloys, the adsorption of the peptides is slightly weakened compared to that on the clean Mg(0001) surfaces. Our results provide useful guidance in understanding the interactions between peptides and the Mg-based biomedical alloy surfaces at the atomic scale in the biomimetic coating fields.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Studying the adsorption behaviors of biomolecules on the surface of Mg and Mg-based alloy has a fundamental and important role for related applications in biotechnology. In the present work, we systematically investigate and compare the adsorption properties of three typical amino acids,  i.e. , Arg (arginine), Gly (glycine) and Asp (aspartic acid), which form RGD tripeptide, on the Mg (0\u00a00\u00a00\u00a01) surface with various doping (Zn, Y, and Nd), and aim to realize proper binding between biomolecules and Mg and Mg-based biomedical materials. Our results show that flat adsorption configurations of the functional groups binding to the surfaces are favored in energy for all the three selected amino acids. In specific, for the amino acids adsorped on clean Mg (0\u00a00\u00a00\u00a01) surface, the adsorption energy ( E   ads  ) of Arg is found to be \u22121.67\u00a0eV for the most stable configuration, with amino and guanidyl groups binding with the surface. However, Gly (Asp) is found to binding with the surface through amino and carboxyl groups, with a \u22121.16\u00a0eV (\u22121.15\u00a0eV) binding energy. On the 2% Zn doped Mg (0\u00a00\u00a00\u00a01) alloy surface (Mg\u2013Zn (2%)), the  E   ads   are significantly increased to be \u22121.91\u00a0eV, \u22121.32\u00a0eV and \u22121.35\u00a0eV for Arg, Gly and Asp, respectively. While the Mg\u2013Y (1%) and Mg\u2013Nd (1%) slightly weaken the adsorption of three amino acids. Moreover, we have performed detail discussions of the binding properties between amino acids and surfaces by projected density of states (PDOS) combined with charge transfer analyses. Our studies provide a comprehensive understanding on the interactions between amino acids and Mg and Mg-based alloy surfaces, with respect to facilitate the applications of Mg and Mg-based biomedical alloys in biosensing, drug delivery, biomolecule coating and other fields in biotechnology.",

        "abstract": "The chive gnat, Bradysia odoriphaga, is a notorious pest of Allium species in China. Colour trapping is an established method for monitoring and control of Bradysia species. In order to clarify the effect of colour preference of B. odoriphaga for the perched substrate, multiple-choice tests were used to assess the response of the chive gnat to different colour hues and brightness levels under different intensities of white illumination and two spectrally different illuminations. Given the choice among four colours differing in hue under different intensities of white illumination and two spectrally different illuminations, chive gnat adults significant preferred the black substrate, a lesser preference to brown and green substrates, and the least preference to orange substrate irrespective of illumination. Given the choice among four levels of brightness under the same illumination conditions as those in the previous experiment (different intensities of white illumination and two spectrally different illuminations), chive gnats preferred black substrate over dark grey, light grey and white substrates. Meanwhile, both virgin and mated adults significantly preferred black over other colour hues and brightness. Based on our results, we conclude that the chive gnat adults significantly prefer black substrates irrespective of colour hues and brightness. This behaviour does not alter with ambient light condition changes. No difference observed between choices of female and male adults. Our results provide new insight for understanding the colour choice behaviour in chive gnat and pave a way to improve monitoring and control of chive gnats and management.",

        "abstract": "Influenza (flu) pandemics have posed a great threat to human health in the last century. However, current vaccination strategies and antiviral drugs provide limited protection. RNA interference (RNAi) is an effective means of suppressing influenza virus replication. PB1 is the critical protein subunit of the influenza virus RNA polymerase. The gene encoding this protein, PB1, is highly conserved among different subtypes of IAV and was therefore chosen as the target in this study. The oligonucleotide, PB1-shRNA, contains a 21-bp siRNA corresponding to nucleotides 1,632 to 1,652 of PB1 linear vRNA with BamHI or EcoRI restriction enzyme sites incorporated at the ends. The PB1-shRNA oligonucleotide was directionally cloned into the RNAi-ready pSIREN-shuttle vector. The correct structure of the resulting pSIREN/PB1 plasmid was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were transfected with pSIREN/PB1 and subsequently infected with IAV at an MOI of 0.1 (A/PR/8/34, H1N1). The virus titer in cell culture supernatants was determined 48\u00a0hours later, and it was found that virus growth was inhibited by more than 50-fold relative to controls. Furthermore, embryonated eggs and mice were inoculated with liposome-encapsulated pSIREN/PB1 and then challenged with the A/PR/8/34 virus. The results showed at least a 100-fold inhibition in virus replication in egg allantoic fluid and a survival rate of between 50% and 100% in experimental mice. This study demonstrates that PB1-shRNA expressed by the recombinant plasmid pSIREN/PB1 inhibits influenza A virus replication both in vitro and in vivo. These observations provide a foundation for the development of a new and efficient treatment of influenza infections.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella enteritidis infection occurs in enterogenous diseases, such as gastroenteritis and parenteral focal infection, which often involve inflammation of intestinal epithelial cells. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway participates in the innate immune response to many gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and initiates inflammation in epithelial cells. KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) is a multi-domain RNA-binding protein that recruits the exosome-containing mRNA degradation complex to mRNAs coding for inflammatory response factors. However, it remains unclear whether KSRP is regulated by NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in response to S. enteritidis infection and affects the development of inflammation. Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the role of KSRP in mediating the response to S. enteritidis in Caco-2 cells. The data revealed that S. enteritidis infection decreased KSRP expression, which was suppressed by blocking the NF-\u03baB pathway. Additionally, S. enteritidis infection significantly increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. Overexpression of KSRP reduced the expression levels of inflammatory factors in Caco-2 cells. KSRP was regulated by the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and participated in mediating the innate immune response to S. enteritidis infection in Caco-2 cells, and KSRP acted as a negative regulator of inflammatory gene expression.",
