In this paper, design principle of portable protective gaps for live working on 1000kV AC line was determined; Electrode structure of portable protective gaps for live working on 1000kV AC line was provided; Power frequency breakdown test, power frequency withstand voltage test and switching impulse flashover test of portable protective gaps for live working on 1000kV AC line had been performed, and the maximum portable protective gaps correlated to different altitude elevation were calculated according to the test results; Various actual work conditions are simulated in 1:1 tower window, and switching impulse discharge test concerning insulation matching between portable protective gaps and working gap is carried out by means of fluctuation method, additionally risk of live working with portable protective gaps on 1000kV AC line is calculated. Finally it is proved that live working with portable protective gaps not only improves the safety of the working but also decreases the size of tower. So it is essential that research on live working method with portable protective gaps on 1000kV AC transmission line be carried out and corresponding operation instructions be drawn up. Additionally the research results can provide experiences for live working on 1000kV optimized designed lines, compact lines, and multi-circuit on one tower lines to be constructed in China.",

Degradation of the Pentachiorophenol by bipolar pulsed discharge in Glass-sphere/Water/Air Columns was investigated and the active species formed during discharge process was tested. Experimental results show that PCP can be quickly degraded during the bipolar pulsed discharge process. Almost all the PCP can be converted into other intermediates after 6 min discharge treatment,while all the benzene rings are broken for a 60 min treatment. Hydrogen peroxide and ozone can be formed during the discharge process,which is zero-ordered reaction. Rate constant k increases with the applied voltage and the gas flow rate.",

Because of the high voltage and strong space electrical field intensity of the 1000 kV Ultra High Voltage transmission lines, it is very important and necessary to do research on the safety protection for live working on 750 kV transmission lines. In this paper, according to the practical conditions of the lines, suitable full set screening clothes were developed, and then characteristics of material that the screening clothes made of and the ready-to-wear were tested following corresponding national standards of GB 6568. 1-2000 and GB 6568. 2-2000. In response to the line condition, measuring of electrical field intensity in and outside of screening clothes at different part of body while climbing tower and during equal-potential process, and arc test and impulse current measuring while during equal-potential process are also taken. The tests' results indicated that the screening clothes developed had good performances on electrical field screening, current splitting and voltage sharing, thus met the requirements for the safety protection of human body while live working on 750 kV transmission lines. Based on the research work, conclusions can be drawn that to ensure the safety of live working, persons doing live working should wear full set screening clothes and use potential rod during equal-potential process.",

In order to ensure the safety of the live working and the facility of running and operation under the 1000 AC, It's very important to analyze the impact of a strong electric field on live working workers and the protective measures .It is the first time in the domestic to systemic measure the electric field intensity on human-body surface through 1:1 ratio scale simulated tower at earth working and potential working two operations for 1000kV AC transmission line, and the surface field distribution of live working person have been acquired. The results show that the surface electric field of the earth worker's head, hand-sharp and toe-sharp is about 2000\ue5f2kV/m. The climbing worker should dress in the full set screening clothing, and the potential worker must wear screening helmet besides full set screening clothing at live working for 1000\ue5f2kV AC transmission line. When wearing screening helmet, The maximum electric field intensity of live working people's face is 137kV/m, which is lower than the human perception of AC electric field. The results can give a technology support to the safety running and operation of the living work of 1000kV AC transmission line.",

Static adsorption experiments were carried out to study the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics of citric acid on RCM. The results indicated that the adsorption of citric acid followed the Langmuir isotherm. The Langmuir equilibrium constant (Kb) increased with increasing temperature. The adsorption was a non-spontaneous endothermic process of entropy increasing in thermodynamics of adsorption. The adsorption potential decreased gradually as citric acid concentration increased at the same temperature, and it increased as temperature increased at the same initial concentration of citric acid. The saturated adsorption capacities of citric acid on RCM were 77.0, 80.5 and 84.7 mg/g at 298, 308 and 318 K. The adsorption followed a second-order kinetic equation. The adsorption rate was controlled by the intraparticle diffusion, and the intraparticle diffusion rate constant (K) increased with increasing temperature.",

The effects of sodium chloride (NaCl) preincubation on the cadmium tolerance and removal ability of Pichia kudriavzevii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated in this study. NaCl preincubation improved the biomass of P. kudriavzevii under cadmium stress, while no obvious effect was observed in S. cerevisiae. The improved activities of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) after NaCl preincubation might be an important reason for the decrease of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, cell death, and oxidative damage of proteins and lipids induced by cadmium, contributing to the improvement of the yeast growth. The cadmium bioaccumulation capacity of P. kudriavzevii decreased significantly after NaCl preincubation, which played an important role in mitigating the cadmium toxicity to the yeast. The cadmium removal rate of P. kudriavzevii was obviously higher than S. cerevisiae and was significantly enhanced after NaCl preincubation. The results suggested that NaCl preincubation improved the cadmium tolerance and removal ability of P. kudriavzevii.",

Some physicochemical properties, including structure, monosaccharide composition, and molecular weight distribution, as well as the 4 in vitro antioxidant activities and inhibitory effects on \u03b1-glucosidase of above polysaccharides before and after removing metal ions were investigated. By comparing TTPS and TPSII, we found that they exhibited different antioxidant activities and inhibitory actions against \u03b1-glucosidase after their metal ions were removed. However, the in vitro antioxidant activities and inhibitory effects on \u03b1-glucosidase of TPSI were substantially improved. The study can be a certain reference for tea and soil selection. At the same time, we suggested that pruning leaves of tea plant could be treated as a potential resource for the development of polysaccharide antioxidants and hypoglycemic products.",

        "abstract": "Patulin contamination of fruit- and vegetable-based products had become a major challenge for the food industry. Biological methods of patulin control can play an important role due to their safety and high efficiency. In this study, a strain of marine yeast with high patulin degradation ability was screened. The yeast was identified as Kodameae ohmeri by the BioLog identification system and partial 26S rRNA gene sequencing. The degradation products of patulin were identified as (E)- and (Z)-ascladiol through HPLC and LC-TOF/MS. High patulin tolerance at 100 \u03bcg ml(-1) and a high degradation rate at 35\u00b0C at a pH between 3 and 6 indicates the potential application of K. ohmeri for patulin detoxification of apple-derived products.",

        "abstract": "A Gram-negative, aerobic, short rod-shaped and non-motile bacterium, designated SWA25(T), was isolated from Chinese fermented fish sauce in Shantou, Guangdong Province, China. Strain SWA25(T) was moderately halophilic, formed colourless colonies and grew at 10-45 \u00b0C (optimum, 37 \u00b0C) and pH 4-9 (optimum, 6-7) in the presence of 0.5-22.5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 3 %). The major cellular fatty acids (&amp;gt;10 %) were identified as C18:1 \u03c97C, C16:0, C16:1 \u03c97c, and C19:0 cyclo \u03c98c, and the predominant respiratory ubiquinone was Q-9. The genomic DNA G+C content was 61.3 \u00b1 2.1 mol %. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain SWA25(T) belonged to the genus Halomonas in the family Halomonadaceae. The closest relatives were Halomonas xianhensis A-1(T) (96.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), H. lutea DSM 23508(T) (96.5 %) and H. muralis LMG 20969(T) (96.1 %). DNA-DNA hybridization assays showed 30.7 \u00b1 2.6 % relatedness between strain SWA25(T) and H. xianhensis A-1(T), and 39.4 \u00b1 4.1 % between strain SWA25(T) and H. lutea DSM 23508(T). On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic features, strain SWA25(T) should be placed in the genus Halomonas as a representative of a novel species. The name Halomonas shantousis sp. nov. is proposed, with SWA25(T)(=CCTCC AB 2013151(T) = JCM 19368(T)) as the type strain.",

        "abstract": "This paper described the fluoride removal from water using a new adsorbent namely mixed rare earths modified chitosan (CR). Mixed rare earths mainly contained La followed by Ce which was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). La(III)-modified chitosan (CL) was also prepared as control. For the batch technique, the effects of various parameters such as contact time, pH, adsorbent dose, initial fluoride concentration and co-ions on fluoride adsorption were studied. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize adsorbents. It was observed that the fluoride adsorption capacity of CR (3.72 mgF-/g) was higher than CL (3.16 mgF-/g) at 2 h. The presence of co-ions such as bicarbonate and carbonate greatly affected the fluoride adsorption from water. Characterization experiments indicated the successful chelation between mixed rare earths and chitosan. The possible fluoride adsorption mechanism of CR was explained by a chemical reaction. \u00a9 2013 The Chinese Society of Rare Earths.",

The effects of temperature,initial pH and contact time on the rate of removal of Cu2+ from aqueous solution were measured in a batch system. The biosorption kinetics and isotherm models were also studied. The results showed that temperature (25~40\u2103) had an insignificant effect on Cu2+ biosorption onto the biomass,while initial pH affected the Cu2+ removal rate significantly. The optimum initial pH for the biosorption was 4~6 and decreased as the pH dropped to 2. During the treatment process,the pH of the solution changed from an initial pH range of 4.00 to 6.99 to the natural pH of CuCl2 with the same concentration. The 89.2% of its maximum Cu2+ biosorption capability was achieved during the first 5 min and the Cu2+ biosorption equilibrium was attained within 30 min. The kinetics data fit well with the pseudo-second-order equation. The Freundlich isotherm model described the experimental data of the biosorption of Cu2+ onto Z. rouxii CICC1379 biomass perfectly,followed by the Langmuir isotherm model.",

The effect of the cross-linking with samples on different degrees of hydrolysis on the particle size distribution,the mean diameter per particle surface area and the centrifugal creaming rate of the emulsions were analyzed. The effect of different store conditions,such as room temperature storage,cold storage and freeze storage,on the flocculation stability and coalescence stability of samples were also studied. The result showed that:in the range of degree of hydrolysis(DH 2%~10%),the emulsifying activity of papain hydrolyzed SPI improved with the increase of DH. TGase cross-linking improved the emulsifying stability effectively,especially the cross-linked hydrolyzed SPI with lower DH. The optimum emulsifying stability was obtained when cross-linked the hydrolyzed SPI in DH 10%. During room temperature,the flocculation stability could improve effectively by TGase cross-linking of papain hydrolyzed SPI(DH 6%~10%). Freeze-thaw process would decrease the coalescence stability of emulsion stabilized with SPI,and the emulsions stabilized with cross-linking of the hydrolyzed SPI(DH 6%~10%) could improve the coalescence stability. Thus,these modified samples could be used in some frozen food.",

        "abstract": "A biodegradable composite film without water solubility was made from chitosan and gellan,glycerin as plasticizers,cross-linked by 4% sodium citrate and 2% calcium chloride. Effect of cross-linking time and pH on the mechanical properties and water resistance of composite film were investigated. Besides,infrared spectrum(FT-IR),X-ray diffraction(X-RD),scanning electron microscopy(SEM)and differential scanning calorimetry(DSC)were used to characterize and analyze the structure and thermal stability of the film. The results showed that sodium citrate and calcium chloride cross-linked composite film,and the cross-linking decreased the crystallinity of chitosan and gellan,and then improved thermal stability of composite film. The composite film had the best properties under a cross-linking time of 5min and pH6. 0,tensile strength 91. 45MPa,water solubility 7. 28%,swelling ratio 416. 63%,water vapor permeability 0. 68\u00d710-10g/(Pa\u00b7s\u00b7m2),compounding and ion crosslinking improved mechanical properties and water resistance of single film.",

The relationship between setting times (including initial and final setting time) and the characteristic points of the electrodeless resistance is studied, aiming to establish a rapid testing method which could predict the setting time of MKPC. Moreover, a linear relationship between the standard compressive strength at 28 days and the resistivity at 24 h of MKPC is also established, and demonstrates that the resistivity and the standard compressive strength have a compact corresponding relationship. Therefore, the standard compressive strength of magnesium potassium phosphate cement could be predicted by electrodeless resistivity parameters. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

However, there are currently no published experimental results of it. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on the use of fiber optic based technique for early detection of delamination at the web/flange junction of a GFRP I-beam. A PZT transmitter was employed to create the stress waves in the beam element, and an optical fiber interferometric sensor with high sensitivity and long sensing arm was attached to the surface of the beam to serve as an ultrasonic receiver. From the laboratory validation, the proposed technique successfully captures the presence of delamination. Additional frequency component was observed at the delamination location and at the resonant frequency relating to the defect depth. The results also show a close correlation between the experiment and the theory. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Berberine is one of the main alkaloids of Rhizoma coptidis which has been used as a folk medicine to treat diabetes mellitus for more than 1400 years in China. To investigate the chronic effect of berberine on diabetic hyperlipidemic rats, fasted rats were intraperitoneally injected 35 mg/kg streptozotocin. Diabetic rats were admitted after 2 weeks and given a high-carbohydrate/high-fat diet to induce hyperlipidemia. The rats were divided into 7 groups at the end of week 16: normal and diabetic rats received no drug, 5 treatment groups were administered with either 75, 150, 300 mg/kg berberine, 100 mg/kg fenofibrate or 4 mg/kg rosiglitazone per day for 16 weeks, respectively. The blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, lipid metabolic parameters and hepatic glycogen and triglyceride were measured, and histopathology and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) alpha/delta/gamma expression of liver were determined by hematoxylin eosin and immunohistochemical staining. Berberine reduced diabetic rats' body weight, liver weight and liver to body weight ratio. Berberine restored the increased blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and the decreased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI levels in diabetic rats to near the control ones. Berberine alleviated the pathological progression of liver and reverted the increased hepatic glycogen and triglyceride to near the control levels. Berberine increased PPARalpha/delta expression and reduced PPARgamma expression in liver of diabetic rat to near the control ones. Berberine improved glucolipid metabolism both in blood and liver in diabetic rats possibly through modulating the metabolic related PPARalpha/delta/gamma protein expression in liver.",

        "abstract": "AIM:To investigate the protective effect of berberine on the diabetic CA3 region of hippocampus injury and the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) \u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b3 and positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in this process. METHODS: Diabetic rats were induced by an injection of 35 mg/kg streptozotocin and a high-carbohydrate/high-fat diet for 16 weeks. At the end of week 16, the rats were divided into 7 groups: the control group rats and the diabetic model group rats were treated with no drugs, diabetic rats of the other five groups were given low-dose, middle-dose, high-dose berberine (75, 150, 300 mg/kg), fenofibrate (100 mg/kg) and rosiglitazone (4 mg/kg) every day, respectively. The CA3 region of hippocampus morphology was observed with HE staining, and PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b3 and P-TEFb (Cdk9 and cyclin T1) expression were detected by immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULTS: Pyramidal cells were lost in the CA3 region of diabetic rat hippocampus with the shape and arrangement of cells less organized, 16-week treatment with middle-dose, high-dose berberine restored the damaged pyramidal cells to near control. PPAR\u03b3 protein expression was barely detectable in the CA3 region of hippocampus, middle-dose, high-dose berberine and fenofibrate strikingly increased both PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b4 expression in diabetic (P<0.01); middle-dose, high-dose berberine and rosiglitazone markedly took the decreased Cdk9 and cyclin T1 expression back to control level (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Berberine modulates PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4 and P-TEFb (Cdk9 and cyclin T1) protein expression in the CA3 region of diabetic rat hippocampus which may contribute to ameliorate pyramidal cells damage.",

Methods Thirty SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups with six rats in every group. A was normal group; B was high-lipids and high-sucrose feeding group; C was high-lipids and high-sucrose feeding+streptozotocin (STZ) group; D was high-lipids and high-sucrose feeding+doxorubicin hydrochloride+STZ group; E was high-lipids and high-sucrose feeding+mono-nephrectomy+STZ group. The body weight, food-intake, water-intake volume, blood sugar, microprotein in urine were detected in every two weeks. Twelve weeks later after model establishment, the rats were put to death, then heart blood were prepared and kidney was weighed. Results Although taking more food and water, the rats of group E were more emaciated, of higher blood sugar and microprotein in urine, and increased kidney/body weight ratio. There was significant difference between the rats in group E and groups A, B, C, D. Conclusion The rat model established by first high-lipids and high-sucrose feeding for 4 weeks, then mono-nephrectomy, and 2 weeks later intraperitoneal administration of STZ is ideal.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the distribution characteristics of microcapsulated carboplatin in mice. Methods A total of 135 KM mice were used in this study. Five mice underwent sham treatment as controls. Twenty-seven groups (n=5 in each group) were injected of carboplatin poly (D,L lactide/glycolide) microcapsules at the dose of 32.5 mg\u00b7kg -1 or carboplatin into candal vein, and from 0.083 to 48 h after injection, the mice were killed and the carboplatin concentration in the kidney, lungs, spleen, liver and heart were measured respectively by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Results The peak value of carboplatin poly (D, L lactide/glycolide) microcapsules in lungs were 1.76 times as much as that of carboplatin group, and the carboplatin amount distributed in lungs maintained from 31.97% to 45.59% after the injection of carboplatin poly (D,L lactide/glycolide) microcapsules, higher than that after carboplatin injection (12.22% to 18.15%). On the contrary, the peak value and area under the drug-time curve of carboplatin poly (D, L lactide/glycolide) microcapsules in the kidney and the heart were less than that of carboplatin group. Conclusion The higher carboplatin concentration and distribution in lungs can be achieved after the injection of microcapsulated carboplatin than carboplatin injection, which showed remarkable lung-targeted and slow release effects of carboplatin poly (D, L lactide/glycolide) microcapsules.",

Excepted the Ctrl group, neurons were induced to oxidative stress by 20 gmolLAbeta25-35. The MTT and fluorescent probes labeling were used to observe the effect of GBE50 with different concentrations on the cell viability and the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurons. Furthermore, Western blot was used to detect the cytoplasmic/total cytochrome C (Cyto C) ratio and total intracytoplasmal Cyto C, and the effect of the expression of oxidative stress-related protein Cyto C and activated Caspase-3 in three GBE50 concentrations groups (25, 50, and 100 microg/mL).Compared with the Ctrl group, the cell vitality was obviously lowered and intracellular ROS generation significantly increased after induction of 20 micromol/L Abeta25-35 (both P < 0.05). Compared with the Abeta group, the cell vitality was evidently improved after treated with different GBE50 doses. Except for 10 microg/mL, the cell vitality could be obviously elevated along with increased drug concentrations (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the intracellular ROS generation decreased significantly in each GBE50 dose groups (P < 0.05). Abeta could increase the cytoplasmic/total Cyto C ratio and enhance the activated Caspase-3 expression significantly (P < 0.05). Compared with the Abeta group, among the three concentrations of GBE50, the Cyto C ratio was obviously lowered in the 100 microg/mL GBE50 group (P < 0.05), and the expression of activated Caspase-3 significantly decreased in 50 microg/mL and 100 microg/mL GBE50 groups (P < 0.05).20 micromol/L Abeta25-35 could induce the generation of intracellular ROS in hippocampal neurons. GBE50 could inhibit Abeta induced intracellular oxidative stress of neurons through lowering the cytoplasmic/total Cyto C ratio and inhibiting the activation of apoptosis protein Caspase-3 expression.",

        "abstract": "To study the effects of Ginkgo biloba extract 50 (GBE50) on inflammatory cytokines and glia cell injury in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of aging rats and its probable mechanism. Methods Totally 45 male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups, i.e., the normal control group (n=12), the model group (n=11), the low dose GBE50 group (n=10), and the high dose GBE50 group (n=12). The aging rat model was intraperitoneally injected with D-galactose to establish the aging model for 42 days. Starting from the 22nd day of modeling, rats in the low dose GBE50 group and the high dose GBE50 group were administered by gastrogavage with 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg respectively. The protein contents and mRNA expressions of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-a in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of rats were detected by radioimmunoassay and Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR assay respectively. The ultrastructural changes of glia cells in the hippocampal CA1 region were observed by transmission electron microscope. Results The protein contents and mRNA expressions of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus of aging rats obviously increased when compared with the normal control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The content of IL-6 in the hippocampus of aging rats obviously decreased (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the protein content and mRNA expression of IL-1beta in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus were obviously downregulated in the low and high dose GBE50 groups. The content of TNF-alpha in the prefrontal cortex was obviously downregulated in the low and high dose GBE50 groups, the content of TNF-alpha in the hippocampus was obviously downregulated in the low dose GBE50 group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The content of IL-6 in the prefrontal cortex of the low dose GBE50 group was up-regulated. The content of IL-6 in the hippocampus of the high dose GBE50 group was also upregulated. The mRNA expression of IL-6 in the prefrontal cortex of the low and high dose GBE50 groups obviously increased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Low and high dose GBE50 showed obvious recovery on the ultrastructural damage of glia cells in the hippocampal CA1 region.GBE50 showed inhibitive effects on the inflammatory reaction of nerves of aging rats. Its mechanism might be possibly correlated with its regulatory effects on the cytokines in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, as well as the ultrastructures of glia cells in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus to some degree.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To observe the effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE50) on learning and memory impairment induced by D-galactose and contents of IL-1\u03b2,IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in hippocampus of senile rats,in an attempt to study its mechanisms in improving learning and memory. Methods: SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group,model group and treatment group. In modeling,D-galactose was injected into abdomen according to 100mg/kg in the morning for 42 days. From the 21st day after modeling,GBE50 was given through gastric perfusion according to 150mg/kg in treatment group every day,and continuously for 21 days. Distilled water containing 1% CMC-Na was given in control and model groups. After treatment,Morris water maze tests were used to detect the change of rat behavior and the contents of IL-1\u03b2,IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in hippocampus in all groups by radioimmunoassay. Results: The escape latency of the rats in model group was significantly longer than that in control group; the percentage of distance was lower(P < 0.05,P < 0.01); however,the escape latency of the rats in treatment group was significantly shorter than that in model group,and the percentage of distance was higher(P < 0.05,P < 0.01). The contents of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in hippocampus of model group were significantly higher than those of control group,but contents of IL-6 were lower (P < 0.05,P < 0.01). Compared with model group,the contents of IL-1\u03b2 in treatment group were significantly decreased; and the contents of IL-6 were significantly increased (P < 0.05,P < 0.01). Conclusion: GBE50 can improve the impaired learning and memory of senile rats induced by D-galactose by regulating the contents of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in hippocampus,and inhibiting immune inflammatory reaction in central nerve system induced by D-galactose.",

        "abstract": "Overactivated microglia contribute to a variety of pathological conditions in the central nervous system. The major goal of the present study is to evaluate the potential suppressing effects of a new type of Ginko biloba extract, GBE50, on activated microglia which causes proinflammatory responses and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Murine BV2 microglia cells, with or without pretreatmentof GBE50 at various concentrations, were activated by incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A series of biochemical and microscopic assays were performed to measure cell viability, cell morphology, release of tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1 ) and interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1 \u03b2 ), and signal transduction via the p38 MAPK and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- \u03ba B) p65 pathways. We found that GBE50 pretreatment suppressed LPS-induced morphological changes in BV2 cells. Moreover, GBE50 treatment significantly reduced the release of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF- \u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2 , and inhibited the associated signal transduction through the p38 MAPK and NF- \u03ba B p65 pathways. These results demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of GBE50 on LPS-activated BV2 microglia cells, and indicated that GBE50 reduced the LPS-induced proinflammatory TNF- \u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2 release by inhibiting signal transduction through the NF- \u03ba B p65 and p38 MAPK pathways. Our findings reveal, at least in part, the molecular basis underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of GBE50.",

The SiNWs possess desirable axial orientation and controllable doping characteristics. Based on this method, large-area SiNW p-n junction diode arrays also were successfully prepared. Optical reflection measurements show that the obtained SiNW arrays could drastically suppress the optical reflection over a wide spectral bandwidth. Because of the remarkable optical antireflection performance, a prototype SiNW-based cell with a conversion efficiency of 9.23% was achieved. Main factors affecting the improvement of conversion efficiency also were studied, which will pave the way for the following work.",

VA-SiNW array solar cells and SA-SiNW array solar cells exhibit a highest power conversion efficiency of 9.31% and 11.37% respectively. Lower series resistance of SA-SiNW array solar cells than that of VA-SiNW array solar cells benefits a higher fill factor and thus improves the cell performance. Electrical loss from high surface recombination in SiNW arrays is dominant in our SiNW array cells and therefore suppresses the cell performance.",

A cheaper solution of Na_ 2 SiO_ 3 is used instead of the conventional solution of NaOH+IPA (isopropyl alcohol) in the c-Si wafer etching process. A wafer with a suede structure and a mean reflectivity of about 12.56% was obtained after corrosion with 5%(in mass)Na_ 2 SiO_ 3 solution at 80 \u2103 for 120 min without mechanical de-bubbling. The reflectivity and uniformity on the surface of wafers corroded by using Na_ 2 SiO_ 3 solution only are not as good as those corroded by using the NaOH +IPA solution. Furthermore, the addition of a small quantity of Na_ 2 SiO_ 3 into a conventional sodium solution of NaOH +IPA can greatly promote the etching reaction in the process and obtain a more homogeneous anti-reflection texture.",

For comparison, the annealing of czochralski (CZ) silicon was also carried out under the same conditions. The results revealed that oxygen and carbon concentration of mc-Si had a greater decrease than that of CZ-Si, which means the more oxygen precipitates in mc-Si were generated. High density defects of mc-Si such as grain boundaries, dislocations improve formation of oxygen precipitates. Bulk lifetime of mc-Si and CZ-Si greatly increased. The reason of lifetime increase is probably attributed to the fact that lots of oxygen precipitates and defect complex compound generated after three step annealing, which could be suction centers of defect. The reduced carrier decentralized recombination centers resulted in improvement of lifetime of wafer. Tendency difference of lifetime was correlated with interior structure of crystalline silicon.",

In this article, a finite element method (FEM) of filament-wound composites is developed which is based on the micro stiffness model of a filament-wound composite. The micro stiffness model is based on Fourier series. The micro stiffness is brought into FEM through a mapping relation between the micro stiffness field and macro structure. Anisotropic element is used in this method. No complicated treatment on geometrical modeling and meshing is needed. The flow chart of this method is first established, and MATLAB is used for developing a program for the micro stiffness model. The APDL language is used for developing the program of geometrical modeling, meshing, and inputting material properties, etc. Finally a numerical example is analyzed. The result of the example shows that the stress and strain of every layer is in periodical distribution, and that the local stress is amplified by the undulation of the fiber. Direction shifting of the fiber causes shear stress shifting, and the reduction of local stiffness causes the local strain to be larger than the average strain. Compared with traditional methods, the application of micro stiffness in FEM can better indicate the effect of micro structure on stress and strain.",

The multi-axial fatigue parameter based on the critical plane was used to predict the fretting fatigue life. On the basis of calculating determinate life, the randomicity of modulus of elasticity, friction coefficient and material constant in the life model were considered, and the fretting fatigue life reliability model was obtained by Monte-Carlo simulation method along with the response surface method. Finally, the method was applied to analyze fretting fatigue life reliability of dovetail joint, proving the feasibility and validity of this method.",

Modified Hashin failure criterion was used to fatigue damage analysis. The rules of sudden degradation and gradual degradation were applied in material property degradation technique for modifying element stiffness and strength. Simulation results show that this progressive fatigue damage method is competent for simulating progressive damage and predicting fatigue life of laminated composites with arbitrary geometry and ply stacking sequence.

The model can predict the fatigue life of laminated composites with different ply parameters, geometry, impact damage, and fatigue loading conditions. In order to obtain the impact damage information in the case that no impact test data is available, a whole damage process analysis method for laminated composites under the impact loading and the fatigue loading is analyzed. The predicted damage statuses of composite laminates can be used to analyze the post-impact fatigue life. A parametric modeling program is developed to predict the impact damage process and the fatigue life of impacted laminates based on the whole damage process analysis method.

The coupling coefficients of flexure and shear were introduced, and the coupling equations of flexure and shear were deduced based on Tsai-Hill criteria. The coupling effect of flexure and shear was analyzed quantificationally, and the modification method of the experimental results was presented. It was shown that the experimental results of three-point bend were influenced obviously by the coupling of flexure and shear. The flexural strength error from the coupling effect increased with the flexural-shear strength ratio, whereas the shear strength error decreased with it. For the given coupling coefficients of flexure and shear, the test errors were determined by the division of span-height ratio into the flexural-shear strength ratio. The experimental results were modified by the modification methods, and the correctional results of three-point bend on different span-height ratios became more comparable.

In this paper, a kind of 2.5D woven T-shaped hooking composite structure, which consists of a groove structure and a T-shaped structure, was designed and used for bending test and tensile test, respectively. Experimental results showed that the initial damages both occur at the root-edge of web, and then the damages extend to the root-middle in bending test or extend perpendicular to the root-edge to the edge of the flange in tensile test. Then, a strength prediction method of progressive damage for 2.5D woven T-shaped hooking composite structure based on three-unit-cell model was proposed and used to describe the mechanical behaviors and damage processes of the connecting structure under bending/tensile loads, respectively. The comparisons between the simulation results and tests showed that the maximum error of the bending/tensile strengths is less than 15% and the damage modes between tests and simulations are similar. Therefore, the predicted strengths are accurate and the strength prediction method of progressive damage proposed in this paper is effective.",

        "abstract": "The full-length cDNA encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) has been isolated from cDNA library of Jatropha curcas L, denoted as Jc-Tctp1 with GenBank accession number EF091818. The Jc-Tctp1 is 1 410 bp in length that contains a 507 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative protein of 168 amino acid residures. The predicted structure of Jc-TCTP1 appeared to be consist of an \u03b1-helical core and a \u03b2-sheet core, which are composed of 3 major \u03b1-helices and 4 major \u03b2-sheets, respectively. A homologous microtubule binding (MTB) domain as well as a calcium binding (CaB) domain can also be identified from the predictions. The Jc-TCTP1 amino acid sequence is highly homologous to other TCTPs, such as from Hevea brasiliensis (93%), Elaeis guineensis (90%), Glycine max (85%), Oryza sativa (84%), Populus trichocarpa (85%), Lycopersicon esculentum (84%), Picea sitchensis (77%), Arabidopsis thaliana (80%) and Zea may (77%). The semi-quantitative RT-PCR results have shown that Jc-Tctp1 expression was the highest in the stem, endosperm at\u2160stage and embryo of Jatropha curcas tissues, and the lowest in the endosperm at stage \u2161 and flower, demonstrating a pattern of temporal and spatial specific expression. This might related to certain divergence in the phylogenic analysis of plant TCTP sequences where the selected monocots were not forming a separate cluster.",

Shoot regeneration from callus required the combinations of IBA 0.5 mg/L with BA 0.1 mg/L, IBA 0.5 mg/L with BA 0.2 mg/L and IBA 1.0 mg/L with BA 0.5 mg/L, and the most suitable combination was IBA 1.0 mg/L and BA 0.5 mg/L. The health adventitious buds and regenerated shoots could be rooted on growth regulator-free MS medium. Regenerated plants with well developed shoots and roots were successfully transferred to greenhouse, without visible detectable variation.",

The cloned cDNA encompasses a 1 224 bp open reading frame, which encodes a 407 amino acid peptide. The alignments with F-box proteins in plants show 52% and 75% identity with Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa respectively, while the alignments with F-box proteins in animals show 48%\uff5e56% identity. Pfam search predicted some conserved domains or motifs in the deduced protein, including F-box and leucine-rich repeat domains. The genomic gene sequence was obtained too, and its analysis indicated that two extrons and an intron were 331 bp, 893 bp and 362 bp long, respectively. Nucleotide sequences of all exon/ intron boundaries agreed with the GT/AG rule. The similar genomic character was also found in the A. thaliana and O. sativa homologues. Moreover, a eukaryotic expression vector, pBI121- Jc-Fbl1-GFP, was constructed and confirmed, which helps farther studies on this protein.",

        "abstract": "High chilling-susceptibility is becoming the bottleneck for cultivation and commercialization of Jatropha curcas L. For insights to chilling resistance ability of this plant species, a cold response transcription factor, JcCBF2, was cloned and studied. It codes a 26 kDa protein, which contains all conserved motifs unique to the C-repeat binding factor (CBF) family and has high similarity to CBFs of Ricinus communis and Populus. Its transcripts express specifically in leaves of Jatropha at cold temperature. After transmitting the report vector, 35S::JcCBF2-GFP, into Arabidopsis thaliana, JcCBF2 protein is main detected in cell nucleus, being consistent to the nuclear orientation signal in its N-terminal. Compared to the control Arabidopsis, the frozen leaves of JcCBF2-overexpressed seedlings grow stronger with less malondialdehyde, smaller leaf conductivity and activer superoxide dismutase, showing their higher freezing tolerance. RT-PCR tests revealed that JcCBF2 functioned mainly at the early stage (0-6 h) of resistance events in Arabidopsis, and its transcripts reduced after 6 h. In addition, JcCBF2 could quickly regulate transcripts of some cold-responsive (COR) genes such as RD29A, COR105A and COR6.6, also during the early stage of frozen treatment. This study not only proves the chilling resistance roles of JcCBF2, but also presents a candidate gene engineering for improvement of chilling tolerance in J. curcas.",

In these experimental conditions, curcin was detected and the regression equation y = 31.722 x + 106.88 was obtained, with the correlation coefficient being R2= 0.993 3. The standard curve of indirect ELISA of curcin showed good linear relationship between the concentrations of 0.08-11 \u03bcg/mL. The lowest concentration for detecting curcin was 0.08 \u03bcg/mL. The recovery rates of curcin of high, medium and low concentrations were 95.56%, 102.27%, 98.40%, with the average rate being 98.74%. The average variation coefficients of intra-assay and inter-assay were 4.78%, 6.71%, respectively. The specificity tests were done with two kinds of similar proteins. The antiserum of curcin had no cross-reaction. The contents of curcin in kernel and dreg of J. curcas were detected successfully. Fig 3, Tab 5, Ref 19.",

The 1 334 bp 5\u2032upstream region of the gene encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was isolated from Jatrapha curcas L. by the DNA walking technology. Sequence analysis revealed that the PAL promoter sequence contains not only CAAT and TATA basic modifs that are conserved in the eukaryotic gene promoter, but also various stress related cis-acting elements. Especially, many cis-elements observed in other phenylalanine ammonia lyase promoters are also found in the JcPAL promoter. For further study on the relationship of organization and function of JcPAL promoter, four JcPALP fragments with different deletion regions were inserted into vector pBI121(with GUS report gene) to replace CaMV35S promoter and might be used to investigate their corresponding expression pattern.",

        "abstract": "For further investigations on potential production of triploid plantlet and curcin production from in vitro endosperm cultures of physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.), the endosperm calli of J. curcas were obtained and the calli could rapidly proliferate and have morphogenetic potentiality by comparatively analyzing different disinfection methods and hormone combinations. The mature endosperms of J. curcas were taken as explants for callus induction, and 0.4 mg/L of cytokinin(BA, KT and TDZ) and 2.0 mg/L of auxin (IAA, IBA, NAA and 2,4-D) were used to test callus induction efficiencies. The result showed that the efficiencies of BA and KT were not quite different. TDZ could promote the induction of calli more effectively. Among all the hormone combinations, 2.0 mg/L of 2,4-D induced more calli with base effect and 2.0 mg/LNAA did the second. IAA could make endosperm form calli as well, but the color of the calli was slightly lighter than those induced by IBA, NAA and 2,4-D with lowest effect. Appropriate disinfectants and sterilization time were important to successfully inoculate the endosperm explants. In order to fix appropriate disinfectants and sterilization time, the explants were marinated in 70% ethanol for 30 s firstly, and then 0.1% HgCl_ 2 or 10% NaClO was used for disinfection, and finally, the appropriate disinfectant and the optimum sterilization time were found, that is, treating with 70% ethanol for 30 s, then disinfecting with 10% NaClO for 25 min.

        "abstract": "A PAL gene designated as JcPAL1 was cloned from J. curcas L. The full-length is 2336\u00a0bp in size with one intron and two exons, encoding a polypeptide of 713 amino acids. Its 5\u2032-upstream\n region is rich in putative cis-elements including not only PAL typical TATA box, L-box and transcriptional initiation site\n (TIS) but also light responding motifs. Expression pattern analysis indicated that JcPAL1 were expressed in all tissues, most highly in flowers. When Treated with ABA, GA3, high and low temperature, expression of\n JcPAL1 were induced. Recombinant JcPAL1 has a pH optimum at 8.7 and a temperature optimum at 60\u00b0C in 100\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer. The\n Km and Kcat values are 0.125\u00a0mM and 1.73\u00a0S\u22121 for l-phenylalanine, and 1.312\u00a0mM and 0.109\u00a0S\u22121 for l-tyrosine, respectively. These findings suggested that JcPAL1 might involve in the J. curcas responding to various stresses and l-Phe should be its true physiological substrate. This study is essential prior to uncover whether and how the PAL initiated\n phenylpropanoid metabolic networks functioning in the defense responses of J. curcas.",

Sequence analysis revealed that this cDNA sequence had an open reading frame (ORF) of 1 368 bp encoding 455 amino acids of 52.1\u00d710 3 (M r). Homology analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA exhibited high identity to the plastidial \u03c93-fatty acid desaturase. RT-PCR analysis indicated that this plastidial \u03c93 desaturase had a constitutive expression in the leaf of J. curcas. In this study, the function of this putative desaturase was identified by heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain INVSc1. The analysis of the fatty acids of yeast transformants showed that \u03b1-linolenic acid was accumulated in the yeast. These results suggest that this cDNA encodes a plastidial \u03c93-fatty acid desaturase in J. curcas. Fig 4, Tab 2, Ref 21.",

It possessed all the typical characteristics of ACPs, containing a 4\u2019-phosphopantetheine-binding motif. RT-PCR analysis showed that JcACP gene was expressed in the leaves, stems and seeds of J. curcas. The expression level of JcACP was the highest in seeds and it was not detected in roots. After germination, the expression level of JcACP in seeds increased progressively and reached a peak at 96 h. These results indicated that the expression of JcACP in the seeds was probably related to the seeds metabolism during the germination. It was expressed in Escherichia coli successfully for further research. Fig 5, Ref 18",

The cloned cDNA included a 546 bp complete open reading frame, which encoded a 181 amino acids peptid. This putative peptid contained three motifs: GLDAAGKT, DVGGQ and NKQDL, which involved in the feature of GTP-binding proteins. The alignment results showed Jc-ARF was high identity with many ARFs in other plants, and it was similar to ClassI of human ARFs. The semi-quantitative PCR results showed that Jc-arf expression was the highest in flowers. Further, the expression of Jc-arf could be induced in roots, stems and leaves by PEG, in roots under cool stress. However, it seemed insensitive to the NaCl stress.",

In this study, we found a plant-specific transcription factor JcNAC1, an intriguing regulator modulating plant responses to abiotic stresses and pathogen infection. Expression of JcNAC1 was strongly increased when plants were treated with abscisic acid, salt and polyethylene glycol, and was decreased with salicylic acid, ethylene, and pathogens. Overexpressing JcNAC1 plants showed enhanced tolerance to drought and increased susceptibility to pathogens. Furthermore, over-expression of JcNAC1 in plants also resulted in the expression changes of some stress-related maker genes including curcin-L, which is a special stress-inducible ribosome-inactivating protein gene in J. curcas. These results indicate that JcNAC1 is responsible for stress responses in J. curcas.",

Roxb. using rapid amplification of cDNA ends and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methods. SsFAD3 contained a 1119-bp open reading frame encoding a 372-amino acid polypeptide. The genomic sequence region of the SsFAD3 ORF was composed of 8 exons and 7 introns, similar to other omega-3 FADs found in most plants. The amino acid sequence showed a higher identity with microsomal omega-3 FADs than plastidial omega-3 FADs. Southern blot analysis of SsFAD3 suggested the existence of a small gene family composed of several copies or closely linked genes. SsFAD3 transcripts were detected in shoots, roots, leaves, stems, and seeds, but were most abundant in shoots. The function of SsFAD3 was confirmed by the accumulation of alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-18:3) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformants.",

        "abstract": "Using degenerate primers and RT-PCR, RACE techniques, a 1491 bp cDNA segment of stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SAD) is cloned from developing seeds of Jatropha curcas L. The segment contains a 1191 bp of complete open reading frame (ORF). Analysis in the BLAST on NCBl shows that Jatropha curcas SAD (JSAD) gene encodes a protein precursor composed of a signal peptide of 33 amino acids and a mature peptide of 363 amino acids. The homological analysis shows that JSAD has high level of homology both in nucleotide sequence and in amino acid sequence to other plants SADs. The nucleotide and peptide identity of JSAD to Ricinus communis SAD (RSAD) is up to 89% and 96.2% respectively. Molecular modeling of JSAD indicates that its three-dimensional structure strongly resembled the crystal structure of RSAD. \u00a9 Shanghai University 2007.",

The use of bioengineering methods for regulating the development of trichomes and metabolism is a widely researched topic. In the present study, we demonstrate that JcZFP8, a C2H2 zinc finger protein gene from Jatropha curcas L., can regulate trichome development in transgenic tobacco. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we performed transcriptome profiling of overexpression JcZFP8 transgenic plants and wild-type tobacco. Based on the analysis of differentially expressed genes, we determined that genes of the plant hormone signal transduction pathway was significantly enriched, suggesting that these pathways were modulated in the transgenic plants. In addition, the transcript levels of the known trichome-related genes in Arabidopsis were not significantly changed, whereas CycB2 and MYB genes were differentially expressed in the transgenic plants. Despite tobacco and Arabidopsis have different types of trichomes, all the pathways were associated with C2H2 zinc finger protein genes. Our findings help us to understand the regulation of multicellular trichome formation and suggest a new metabolic engineering method for the improvement of plants.",

Fatty acid (FA) has to be transported from plastid to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for TAG synthesis. However, the role of plastid FA transportation during seed oil accumulation has not been evaluated. AtFAX1 (Arabidopsis fatty acid export1) mediated the FA export from plastid. In this study, we overexpressed AtFAX1 under the control of a seed specific promoter in Arabidopsis. The resultant overexpression lines (OEs) produced seeds which contained 21-33% more oil and 24-30% more protein per seed than those of the wild type (WT). The increased oil content was probably because of the enhanced FA and TAG synthetic activity. The seed size and weight were both increased accordingly. In addition, the seed number per silique and silique number per plant had no changes in transgenic plants. Taken together, our results demonstrated that seed specific overexpression of AtFAX1 could promote oil accumulation in Arabidopsis seeds and manipulating FA transportation is a feasible strategy for increasing the seed oil content.",

However, Jatropha breeding material is rather limited due to incomplete information regarding phylogenetic relationships among germplasm resources. Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on the internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA ITS), two chloroplast regions (trnL-F and rbcL), and the combined (ITS+trnL-F+rbcL) dataset among twenty-five specimens representing six key Jatropha species. Phylogenetic relationships of Jatropha were well resolved between subgenus Curcas and subgenus Jatropha, and demonstrated the intermediate position of section Polymorphae among sections of both subgenera. Jatropha curcas and J. integerrima demonstrated a close phylogenetic relationship. The molecular data agreed with the morphological classification that recognized J. multifida and J. podagrica in sec. Peltatae. The distinct intraspecific divergence that occurred in J. curcas could be attributed to restricted gene flow caused by geographical isolation and different ecological conditions. Phylograms produced with trnL-F and rbcL sequence data suggested slow rates of sequence divergence among Jatropha spp., while the ITS gene tree had good resolution suggesting high genetic variation of ITS among Jatropha species.",

        "abstract": "Background:   Jatropha curcas  is a wide-spreading latex-rich biodiesel plant, of which the high oil content seeds were always under intense studies, but somehow NOT the latex that is considered to be rich in proteins with potential important physiological functions, and secondary metabolites to make a promising source for drug discovery. The proteomic analysis which would make the first step to study these substances was hampered by interfering parts of them. Phenol extraction and TCA/acetone extraction, two major plant proteomic isolation methods, were used and compared for this study.    Results:  The first  J. curcas  latex proteome to our knowledge is reported as 459 proteins were identified in total with such two extraction techniques combined. Although phenol extraction (401 proteins) identified much more latex proteins (123 proteins for TCA/acetone), only 65 proteins were commonly isolated by both methods. Biochemical property analysis revealed that relatively more lower-pI-proteins were isolated by TCA/acetone method (pI mode: 4.79, 6.51 for Phenol). Moreover, GO, COG and KEGG analysis showed that certain classes/categories/pathways annotated more proteins than others, and most of them entitled proportionally comparable protein counts of the two methods, however with exemplified exceptions.    Conclusions:  Large part of proteins were found exclusively identified by either method may due to multiple causes discussed below, indicating a better proteome coverage of plant samples with such context needs combination of multiple isolation methods. In addition, the core biological function of the latex may as speculated be uncovered by certain GO, COG and KEGG classes/categories/pathways annotating more proteins.",

        "abstract": "Background:  Jatropha curcas L., as an important strategic biofuel resource with considerable economic potential, has attracted worldwide attention. However, J. curcas has yet to be domesticated. Plant height, an important agronomic trait of J. curcas, has not been sufficiently improved, and the genetic regulation of this trait in J. curcas is not fully understood. Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), a class of transcription factors, have previously been shown to play critical roles in regulating multiple aspects of plant growth and development and may accordingly be implicated in the genetic regulation of plant height in J. curcas.   Results:  In this study, we cloned JcZFP8, a C2H2 ZFP gene in J. curcas. We found that the JcZFP8 protein was localized in the nucleus and contained a conserved QALGGH motif in its C2H2 structure. Furthermore, ectopic expression of JcZFP8 under the control of the 35S promoter in transgenic tobacco resulted in dwarf plants with malformed leaves. However, when JcZFP8 was knocked out, the transgenic tobacco did not show the dwarf phenotype. After treatment with the gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC), the dwarf phenotype was more severe than plants that did not receive the PAC treatment, whereas application of exogenous gibberellin3 (GA3) reduced the dwarf phenotype in transgenic plants.       Conclusions:  The results of this study indicate that JcZFP8 may play a role in J. curcas plant phenotype through GA-related pathways. Our findings may help us to understand the genetic regulation of plant development in J. curcas and to accelerate breeding progress through engineering of the GA metabolic pathway in this plant.",

        "abstract": "Background: Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable, abundant, and inexpensive resource for biorefining process to produce biofuel and valuable chemicals. To make the process become feasible, it requires the use of both efficient pretreatment and hydrolysis enzymes to generate fermentable sugars. Ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment has been demonstrated to be a promising method to enhance the saccharification of biomass by cellulase enzyme; however, the remaining IL in the hydrolysis buffer strongly inhibits the function of cellulase. This study aimed to isolate a potential IL-tolerant cellulase producing bacterium to be applied in biorefining process. Result: One Bacillus sp., MSL2 strain, obtained from rice paddy field soil was isolated based on screening of cellulase assay. Its cellulase enzyme was purified and fractionated using a size exclusion chromatography. The molecular weight of purified cellulose was 48 kDa as revealed by SDS-PAGE and zymogram analysis. In the presence of the IL, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) concentration of 1 M, the cellulase activity retained 77.7% of non-IL condition. In addition, the optimum temperature and pH of the enzyme is 50\u00b0C and pH 6.0, respectively. However, this cellulase retained its activity more than 90% at 55\u00b0C, and pH 4.0. Kinetic analysis of purified enzyme showed that the Km and Vmax were 0.8 mg/mL and 1000 \u03bcM/min, respectively. Conclusion: The characterization of cellulase produced from MSL2 strain was described here. These properties of cellulase made this bacterial strain become potential to be used in the biorefining process.",

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant abiotic stress responses, especially to salinity and drought stresses, in species such as P. paniceum could be important to broader crop improvement efforts. GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMPase) is the limiting enzyme in the synthesis of L-ascorbic acid (AsA), which plays a crucial role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have cloned and characterized the cDNA of the PpGMP gene of P. paniceum encoding a GMPase. The full-length cDNA sequence contains 1411 nucleotides encoding a putative protein with 361 amino acid residues and an approximate molecular mass of 39.68 kDa. The GMPase transcript was up-regulated in P. paniceum plants subjected to salinity and drought stress, respectively. Transgenic tobacco expressing PpGMPase exhibited enhanced salinity and drought resistance, a higher seed germination rate, better growth performance, a higher AsA content, a more stable redox state, higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and lower levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and H2O2 under drought and salinity stress. Taken together, expression of PpGMPase in tobacco conferred salinity and drought stress tolerance by increasing the content of AsA, thereby enhancing ROS-detoxifying functions. Thus, PpGMP is a potential candidate gene for crop improvement. ",

Although there are many methods for upgrading bio-oil, there is no effective way to solve the problems existing in bio-oil. The aim of the paper is to find a breakthrough from the bio-oil preparation, which using vacuum pyrolysis method to obtain bio-oil from pine straw at bench scale. The influence of temperatures (400-600\u00b0C) and biomass dimensions (150-830 \u03bcm) on vacuum pyrolysis were investigated. The reaction temperatures were set at 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600\u00b0C. The dimensions of feedstock were 150-180, >180-250, >250-380, >380-830 \u03bcm. The optimal temperature was 500\u00b0C and at this temperature the biomass with dimension of >250-380 could yield the highest liquid product (about 52%) and the lowest solid product (about 25%). The gas and liquid products from vacuum pyrolysis biomass in the optimal condition were analyzed by GC, GC-MS, FT-IR. The gas product contains H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and CnHm. At the beginning of the reaction, there were high percentages of CO and CnHm in the gas product. With the proceeding of the reaction, the percentage of CH4 became higher and the percentage of CO2 became lower. The percentage of H2 and CO reached its highest point at 40 min. The pH value of the bio-oil was a little low (2.16). The water content was 46.2%. The viscosity (5.2 mm2/s) was better than that of bio-oil from other pyrolysis methods. Using the area representative compounds content, the GC-MS results indicated that the phenols and ketones were the main compounds in bio-oil, which were 21.98% and 36.55% respectively in the liquid product. The acids contents were 14.27% and the alcohols were 3.08%. The vacuum pyrolysis method, for its simple structure and easily operation, can be a potential way to obtain bio-oil from biomass. Meanwhile, compared with the bio-oil by other pyrolysis methods, the vacuum pyrolysis bio-oil has good flow property and a lot of high valuable compounds. It's good for further upgrading and obtaining chemicals from vacuum pyrolysis bio-oil.",

The catalysts were used for esterification of ethanol and acetic acid. SO~ 2- _4/40%SiO_2-TiO_2 prepared by mechanical mixing and calcination at 400 \u2103 exhibited the highest activity, and the acetic acid conversion was nearly 100% in partial reflux rectifying esterification and up to 84% in total reflux esterification, which was close to the chemical equilibrium composition. X-ray diffraction patterns indicated that SiO_2 inhibited the excessive formation of titanium oxide sulfate. The combination of tetragonal crystal anatase TiO_2, orthorhombic crystal titanium oxide sulfate, and cubic crystal titanium with high surface area SiO_2 ensured the high activity of the catalysts. Infrared spectra showed that the addition of SiO_2 helped the formation of Ti-O-Si linkage which enhanced the strong bonding of SO~ 2- _4 with the catalyst surface. The sulfate species bonded were in bidentately chelating and covalent sulfate structures. Thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry proved that SO~ 2- _4 was hardly removed with the addition of SiO_2 and the temperature for transformation of anatase to rutile was lowered.",

The effects of Mo promoter content and the catalyst reducing temperature on hydrotreatment activity of the catalyst were studied under 200 \u00b0C and 3 MPa hydrogen pressure using acetic acid as the model compound. The XRD results indicate that the addition of Mo promoter is beneficial to the uniformity of nickel species on the catalyst and decreases the interaction between nickel species and the support which results in the decrease the of NiAl 20 4 spinel formation. The addition of Mo promoter also decreases the reducing temperature of the catalyst.

Genes that are present in certain isolates may determine strain-specific traits such as disease association and drug resistance. In order to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of gastric diseases, identify molecular markers of the diseases associated with H. pylori strains and provide clues for target treatment of H. pylori-related diseases, a subtracted DNA library was constructed from a gastric cancer-associated H. pylori strain and a superficial gastritis-associated H. pylori strain by suppression subtractive hybridization. The presence of gastric cancer-specific genes was identified by dot blot hybridization, DNA sequencing and PCR-based screening. Twelve gastric cancer-specific high-copy genes and nine low-copy genes were found in gastric cancer compared with the superficial gastritis strain. These genes were confirmed by PCR analysis of H. pylori isolates. Notably, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) was detected positively in 11 out of 22 (50%) gastric cancer-associated H. pylori strains. In contrast, <24% of the H. pylori strains from superficial gastritis showed positive results. Given the potential role of PPIases in cell growth, apoptosis and oncogenic transformation, our results suggest that PPIase may represent a novel marker and potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with increased risk for the development of gastric cancer. Animal studies have also shown that H. pylori infection leads to gastric carcinogenesis, especially intestinal phenotypes. However, no in vitro study has been carried out for cell transformation induced by H. pylori. The present study aimed to investigate whether 'chronic'H. pylori infection induces gastric epithelial cell transformation, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of transformation induced by H. pylori. The immortalized 'normal' gastric epithelial cell line, GES-1, was co-cultured for 45 days with H. pylori strains B975 and L301. The cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, Ki-67 antigen, and colony formation assay. The cell transformation was determined by observing cell morphology and measuring the expression of E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, and transcription factor-4 (TCF-4) at both protein and mRNA levels. H. pylori induced morphologic changes in GES-1 cells and significantly increased the proliferation of GES-1 cells. Moreover, H. pylori up-regulated the expression of \u03b2-catenin and TCF-4, and also induced the nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin. In addition, the diffusive gastric cancer-related gene, E-cadherin, was up-regulated at the protein level, but down-regulated at the mRNA level. H. pylori infection is capable of inducing GES-1 transformation to present with the characteristics of intestinal-type gastric cancers in vitro, likely through the \u03b2-catenin/TCF-4 signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "AIM:To investigate whether Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection can induce oxidative DNA damage in human gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 and human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901.METHODS:H pylori was co-cultured with GES-1 and SGC-7901 cells, respectively. The morpho-logical changes of GES-1 and SGC-7901 cells between before and after co-culture were observed. The 8-OHdG expression in the two types of cells was detected by laser scanning confocal microscopy.RESULTS: H pylori infection induced oxidative DNA damage in both GES-1 and SGC-7901 cells. The expression levels of 8-OHdG in GES-1 and SGC-7901 cells co-cultured with H pylori were significantly higher than those in control cells (64.9396\u00b117.8142 vs 32.3010\u00b17.3620 and 102.8344\u00b130.2632 vs 77.1336\u00b132.3223, respectively; both P=0.000). The extent of 8-OHdG upregulation in GES-1 cells co-cultured with H pylori was significantly higher than that in SGC-7901 cells co-cultured with H pylori.CONCLUSION:H pylori infection induces oxidative DNA damage in both GES-1 and SGC-7901 cells. This result supports the hypothesis that H pylori induced-oxidative DNA damage plays a pivotal role in the development of gastric carcinoma in patients with chronic gastritis. GES-1 cell line is superior to SGC-7901 cell line in the study of oxidative damage induced by H pylori.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To determine the expression of E-cadherin, \ufffd\ufffd-catenin, and transcription factor 4 (TCF4) proteins in gastric diseases with relation to Helicobacter pylori infection. Methods: A total of 309 patients including 60 with superficial gastritis (SG), 57 with atrophic gastritis (AG) and 192 with gastric cancer (GC), were enrolled. The expression of E-cadherin, \ufffd\ufffd-catenin, TCF4 proteins in the gastric mucosa was detected by immunohistochemistry and H. pylori infection by immunohistochemistry and PCR. Results: The expression rates of E-cadherin were significantly higher in SG and AG than in GC (P<0.01), while those of \ufffd\ufffd-catenin in the nucleus were significantly lower in SG and AG than in GC (P<0.05). In GC cases, the expression rates of E-cadherin, \ufffd\ufffd-catenin and TCF4 were significantly higher in the intestinal type than in the diffuse type (P<0.05). In GC patients, the expression rate of E-cadherin was significantly higher in the presence of H. pylori than in the absence of infection (P=0.011). Moreover, the expression level of TCF4 and \ufffd\ufffd-catenin protein was significantly higher in the nucleus and cytoplasm in H. pylori positive than in H. pylori negative GC patients, especially in those with the intestinal type (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: The expression of E-cadherin and \ufffd\ufffd-catenin progressively decreases during the process of GC tumorigenesis, while overexpression of TCF4 occurs. H. pylori infection is associated with a significant increase in the expression of E-cadherin and \ufffd\ufffd-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus in GC patients, especially those with the intestinal type.",

We found that the distribution fre-quency of AA, AG, GG three genotypes were 73.3%, 22.1%, 4.6%, respectively. The frequency of AA genotype was statis-tically higher in the gastric cancer (GC) group compared to the control group(P=0.03), moreover, individuals with the MUC1 AA genotype increased 1.92 fold risk for gastric cancer. And compared with subjects carrying both AG+GG geno-type and H. pylori-IgG negative, there was an obviously increased risk of developing gastric cancer for those who carried both AA genotype and H. pylori-IgG negative, both AG+GG genotype and H. pylori-IgG positive, and both AG+GG geno-type and H. pylori-IgG negative, but there were no significantly differences between the every two of the latter three. Our results indicated that there was a relationship between MUC1 A/G polymorphism and susceptibility to gastric cancer. Andthere were probably no statistically interaction between the 568 site A/G polymorphism in MUC1 and H. pylori infection in the occurrence and development process of gastric cancer.",

        "abstract": "It has been shown that hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays an important role during bone development. However, the mechanism(s) by which Hh stimulates osteoblast differentiation are not fully elucidated. This study was performed to examine if Sonic hedgehog (Shh) affects osteoblast differentiation in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and determine the exact role of osterix (Osx) involved in Hh-induced osteoblast differentiation. Our real-time RT-PCR result shows that Shh significantly induced osteoblast differentiation by up-regulation of osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, Type I collagen, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and Osx RNA expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. ALP protein activity, Osx protein expression, as well as Osx promoter activity was also enhanced by Shh treatment in cell culture. Interestingly, Shh-induced Osx up-regulation was only slightly affected by knocking down Runx2 using siRNA in cells within 3 days of culture, however, knocking down Osx expression in cells totally blocked Shh-induced osteoblast differentiation. These findings demonstrate for the first time that Shh stimulates early osteoblast differentiation mainly through up-regulation of the expression of Osx in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells in both Runx2-dependent and Runx2-independent manner.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between gene (105) polymorphism of phase II metabolizing enzymes glutathione S-transferase GSTP1 and susceptibility to non-small cell lung cancer, and sensitivity to chemotherapy. METHODS: There were 204 cases of non-small cell lung cancer patients and the normal control persons, and by using a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), the GSTP1 polymorphism was detected at 105 sites of DNA of peripheral blood of these cases. The 102 cases of non-small cell lung cancer patients chose NP chemotherapy, and the efficiency was evaluated two cycles after chemotherapy. RESULTS: Compared with A/A genotype, in the other two groups G/G and A/G genotype, GSTP1 105 distribution frequencies were of no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). Compared with A/A genotype, in the sensitive group, G/G+A/G distribution frequency (46.47%) was higher than that in the non-sensitive group (21.43%), and there was a statistically significant difference (\u03c72=3.95, P<0.05). Individuals with A/G or G/G allele, compared with patients with A/A genotype, were more sensitive to chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: There are no relevance between GSTP1 105 polymorphism and the risk of non-small cell lung cancer. The sensitivity of NP chemotherapy in cases of non-small cell lung cancer with GSTP1 AG or GG genotype is higher than that of patients with AA genotype.",

In the present study, we therefore investigated biological characteristics of the bacterium exposed to high salt concentrations. H. pylori strain, L301, was cultured in media supplemented with different concentrations (3%, 15% and 30%) of sodium chloride (NaCl) under microaerophilic conditions for 48 h. Morphology was assessed by light microscopy, the ATP content was quantitated by single-tube fluorescent light-emission and the levels of CagA and UreB proteins were determined by Western blotting. After exposure to NaCl, H. pylori transformed from common spiral shape to U or even coccoid shapes. The ATP content was significantly higher in 30% NaCl group than in 15% and 3% NaCl group and the level of CagA protein increased with the salt concentration. The urease reaction was all strongly positive in H. pylori exposed to different salt concentrations. The level of 8-OHdG expression was significantly increased in GES-1 cells co-cultured with H. pylori exposed to high salt, compared with the level in uninfected cells. H. pylori survives under exposure to high salt concentrations up to 30%, exhibiting changes in mobility, morphology and CagA expression, associated with increased 8-OHdG in the gastric epithelial cells, indicative of DNA damage.",

        "abstract": "While Notch signaling plays a critical role in the regulation of cartilage formation, its downstream targets are unknown. To address this we performed gain and losses of function experiments and demonstrate that Notch inhibition of chondrogenesis acts via up-regulation of the transcription factor Twist1. Upon Notch activation, murine limb bud mesenchymal progenitor cells in micromass culture displayed an inhibition of chondrogenesis. Twist1 was found to be exclusively expressed in mesenchymal progenitor cells at the onset stage of chondrogenesis during Notch activation. Inhibition of Notch signaling in these cells significantly reduced protein expression of Twist1. Furthermore, the inhibition effect of NICD1 on MPC chondrogenesis was markedly reduced by knocking down of Twist1. Constitutively active Notch signaling significantly enhanced Twist1 promoter activity; whereas mutation studies indicated that a putative NICD/RBPjK binding element in the promoter region is required for the Notch-responsiveness of the Twist1 promoter. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed that the Notch intracellular domain influences Twist1 by directly binding to the Twist1 promoter. These data provide a novel insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms behind Notch inhibition of the onset of chondrogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are attractive biomarkers and therapeutic targets because of their disease- and stage-restricted expression. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 17 (SNHG17) belongs to a large family of noncoding genes hosting small RNAs, with its expression pattern and biological function not clarified in gastric cancer (GC). Thus, we conducted this study to investigate the functional significance and the underlying mechanisms of SNHG17 in GC progression. Our results showed that SNHG17 expression was upregulated in GC tissues and cells, and its high expression was significantly correlated with increased invasion depth, lymphatic metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. The expression of plasma SNHG17 was also found upregulated in patients with GC compared with healthy controls, with a moderate accuracy for diagnosis of GC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\u2009=\u20090.748; 95% CI, 0.666-0.830). Gain- and loss-of-function of SNHG17 revealed that SNHG17 promoted GC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, invasion, and migration and inhibited apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations showed that SNHG17 was associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 and that this association was required for epigenetic repression of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitors, including p15 and p57, thus contributing to the regulation of GC cell cycle and proliferation. Furthermore, rescue experiments indicated that SNHG17 functioned as an oncogene via activating enhancer of zeste homolog 2 in GC cells. Our study provides a new perspective for SNHG17 acting as a noncoding oncogene in GC tumorigenesis, and it may serve as a novel early diagnostic marker and potential target for the treatment of GC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Malignant cancer cell uncontrolled growth depends on the persistent nutrient availability such as glucose and amino acids, which is required for cancer cell energetic and biosynthetic pathways. As a nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor \u03b4 (PPAR\u03b4) plays a critical role in inflammation and cancer, however, it is still unclear the regulatory mechanism of PPAR\u03b4 on cancer cell metabolism. Here, we found that PPAR\u03b4 directly regulated neutral amino acid transporter SLC1-A5 (solute carrier family 1 member 5) and glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) gene transcription, leading to uptake of glucose and amino acid, activation of mTOR signaling, and tumor progression. In contrast, silence of PPAR\u03b4 or its antagonist inhibited this event. More importantly, PPAR\u03b4 promoted cancer cell metabolic reprogramming resulting in chemoresistance, which was alleviated by PPAR\u03b4 antagonist. These findings revealed a novel mechanism of PPAR\u03b4-mediated tumor progression, which provided a potential strategy for cancer treatment.",

Each of the last two groups, 30 min after pretreatment with different level of LPS, was subjected to 900 mL/L hyperoxia for various times (2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h). The remanent groups was cultured in ambient O(2); in which sLPS group and hLPS group respectively was treated with 100 ng/mL and 1 mg/mL LPS in the cell supernatant. After treatment, at each time point, the cells of each group was harvested and TLR4 gene expression were observed by RT-PCR. TLR4 protein expression at 12 h was observed by Western blotting. TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in the supernatant of cultured microglia N9 cells at different time points were tested with ELISA.After 6 h in hLPS group and 16 h in sLPS group, the expression of TLR4 mRNA was gradually increased(P<0.05), following with increasing time and concentration of LPS, which reached to the maximum at 24 h in hLPS group. Compared with hLPS group, hyperoxia+hLPS group showed downregulation of TLR4 mRNA at each time point after 6 h(P<0.05), especially at 16 h and 24 h. At 12 h, the level of TLR4 protein of hyperoxia+sLPS group and hyperoxia+hLPS group respectively was lower than the corresponding concentration of LPS group. The result of ELISA show that at each time point, compared with the corresponding concentration of LPS group respectively, the expression of TNF-\u03b1 of hyperoxia+sLPS group and hyperoxia+hLPS significantly increased(P<0.05).Hyperoxia enhance the pro-flammation response of N9 microglia triggered by LPS and TLR4 may be the important negative-control target molecule.",

        "abstract": "A novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus has caused great morbidity as well as mortality since its emergence in Eastern China in February 2013. However, the possible risk factors for death are not yet fully known.Patients with H7N9 virus infection between March 1 and August 14, 2013 in Jiangsu province were enrolled. Data were collected with a standard form. Mean or percentage was used to describe the features, and Fisher's exact test or t-test test was used to compare the differences between fatal and nonfatal cases with H7N9 virus infection. A total of 28 patients with H7N9 virus infection were identified among whom, nine (32.1%) died. The median age of fatal cases was significant higher than nonfatal cases (P<0.05). Patients with older age were more strongly associated with increased odds of death (OR\u200a=\u200a30.0; 95% CI, 2.85-315.62). Co-morbidity with chronic lung disease and hypertension were risk factors for mortality (OR\u200a=\u200a14.40; 95% CI, 1.30-159.52, OR\u200a=\u200a6.67; 95% CI, 1.09-40.43, respectively). Moreover, the presence of either bilateral lung inflammation or pulmonary consolidation on chest imaging on admission was related with fatal outcome (OR\u200a=\u200a7.00; 95%CI, 1.10-44.61). Finally, dynamic monitoring showed that lymphopenia was more significant in fatal group than in nonfatal group from day 11 to week five (P<0.05). The decrease in oxygenation indexes were observed in most cases and more significantly in fatal cases after week three (P<0.05), and the value of nearly all fatal cases were below 200 mmHg during our evaluation period.Among cases with H7N9 virus infection, increased age accompanied by co-morbidities was the risk of death. The severity of lung infection at admission, the persistence of lymphocytopenia, and the extended duration of lower oxygenation index all contributed to worsened outcomes of patients with H7N9 virus infection.",

Dendritic cells (DCs) were induced from the mononuclear cells with a cytokine cocktail with or without recombinant human soluble FL (rhFL; 100 ng/ml). The Flt3 receptors on the surface of a human microvascular endothelial cell line (ECV) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The proliferation of ECV stimulated by rhFL was measured with the microculture tetrazolium assay. The levels of FL, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF in the supernatant of ECV cultures were measured by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).rhFL stimulates colony formation from cord blood when used as a sole stimulant. FL in combination with other cytokines increased colony formation significantly. The number of DCs was approximately 2.5 times higher when rhFL was used. rhFL stimulates the proliferation of ECV on which Flt3 receptors are expressed. Furthermore, ECV secretes FL, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF, which were augmented by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and rhFL.rhFL enhances hematopoietic colony formation and DC proliferation from human cord blood cells. FL not only stimulates the proliferation of ECV, but is also secreted by ECV. FL may exert direct and indirect effects on hematopoiesis.",

The labeling efficiency and radiochemical purity of (125)I-5H6 were measured by paper chromatography. The stability of (125)I-5H6 in vitro was monitored by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. The dissociation constant (K(d)) of (125)I-5H6 from HO8910 cells and the numbers of maximum binding sites (B(max)) were obtained by Scatchard analysis. Immunoreactivity of (125)I-5H6 to HO8910 cells was determined by \"Lindmo\" assay and its improved method. Internalization and retention of (125)I- 5H6 by HO8910 cells were studied by cell binding experiments.(1)The labeling efficiency of (125)I-5H6 was (85.4+/-5.2)% and its radiochemical purity was (99.2+/-0.5)%. (2)Radiochemical purity of (125)I-5H6 was (80.3+/-4.7)% after 7 days in 4 Degrees Celsius PB (phosphate buffer) and (95.3+/-0.8)% after 24 hours in 37 Degrees Ceslius plasma. (3)At 4 Degrees Celsius, K(d) for (125)I-5H6 to HO8910 cells was (0.711+/-0.06) nmol/L and Bmax was (2.17+/-0.08)x10(5) sites/cell. (4)Immunoreactivity of (125)I-5H6 was (38.6+/-5.4)%. (5)Retention rate of (125)I-5H6 with HO8910 cells was (89.8+/-6.0)% after 2 hours at 4 Degrees Celsius and internalization rate of (125)I-5H6 by HO8910 cells was (54.9+/-2.6)% after 2 hours at 37 Degrees Celsius.(125)I-5H6 possesses good labeling efficiency and perfect radiochemical purity. (125)I-5H6 has suitable stability in vitro and its immunoreactivity was not low. The high affinity of (125)I-5H6 with HO8910 cells will benefit further animal study in vivo.",

By means of the cell fusion by hybridoma technique and multiple cell subcloning and repeated screening with 293T/4-1BB as the antibody screening positive cell while 293T/mock as the negative cell. The hybridoma cell lines specifically secreting anti-4-1BB monoclonal antibodies were selected. Then their characteristics and its biological activities were investigated by Western blot, fast-strip routine Ig subclass typing method, indirect immunofluorescence, competitive inhibition test, (3);H-TdR and cell apoptosis analysis.Three hybridoma cell lines 1G5, 4B11 and 9F11 with the property of secreting specific anti-4-1BB monoclonal antibody continuously and steadily were successfully obtained. These monoclonal antibodies could bind to human 4-1BB epitopes on activated T cells and monocytoes and DC. Additionally, mAb 4B11 could promote T proliferation and enhance the growth and maturation of Mo-DC.Three hybridoma cell lines which secrete anti-4-1BB monoclonal antibodies steadily have been established. These monoclonal antibodies could specifically recognize 4-1BB molecule and mAb 4B11 had a potent function to promote T proliferation cell as well as to enhance the growth and maturation of Mo-DC in vitro.",

        "abstract": "To Prepare three functional monoclonal antibodies(mAbs) against human FL molecule and analyze their bioactivity.The cell line L929-FL transfected with human FL gene was used as immunogen. The hybridomas secreting the antibodies against human FL were obtained by fusing splenoecytes from the immunized mice with murine myeloma cells(Sp2/0). Their subclasses were analyzed using fast-strip method. The monoclonal antibodies were produced in mouse peritoneal cavity and purified by Protein G affinity chromatography. The inhibitory effect of mAbs against FL on leukemia cell lines U937 and HL-60 was detected by MTT. The apoptosis of U937 and HL-60 cells stained by annexin-V/PI was determined by FCM.Three hybridomas named 3C2, 3C6 and 8D10 were successfully obtained, which secreted monoclonal antibodies against human FL molecule stably. Their subclasses were the mouse IgG2a with kappa light chains. The three monoclonal antibodies recognized the FL molecule on U937 and HL-60 cells that also coexpressed Flt3 molecule. When U937 and HL-60 cells were cultured in presence of 3C2, 3C6 and 8D10, their proliferation was reduced as compared to that in control in MTT assay(P < 0.05). The analysis of annexin-V/PI binding to U937 and HL-60 cells by FCM showed the mAbs had the apoptotogenic activity of the monoclonal antibodies against human FL molecule.3C2, 3C6 and 8D10 are three funtional monoclonal antibodies against human FL molecule. They may be of some value in the study of the roles of FL/Flt3 interaction in leukemia pathogenesis.",

The gene coding hexahistidine was fused at the N-terminal of IZ because the sCD40L-IZ fusion protein could be purified by affinity chromatography. Then the fusion gene was amplified and cloned into expression plasmid pET30a.The protein sCD40L-IZ with His-tag at the N-terminal was effectively expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as inclusion bodies and a denaturation and refolding procedure was performed to acquire soluble sCD40L-IZ. The fusion protein sCD40L-IZ was conveniently purified using HiTrap affinity column with above 95% purity. The gel filtration chromatography and non-reduced SDS-PAGE identified the trimeric structure of the recombinant protein. The microscope analysis showed the sCD40L-IZ interacted with the membrane CD40 on XG2, a multiple myeloma cell line.The recombinant human trimeric CD40L-IZ was expressed in prokaryotic cells successfully, which has provided a basis for further study of the relationship between CD40L and apoptosis, CD40L and pathogenesis of illness.

Using the Ig and hen egg lysozyme double transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the survival of soluble autoantigen-engaged B cells is further reduced in mice lacking CD4 T cells or deficient in CD40. Mixed bone marrow chimera experiments reveal that, under homeostatic conditions, the CD40L-CD40 pathway can augment autoreactive B cell survival in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Naive CD4 T cells are shown to constitutively express CD40L mRNA and protein, although cell surface CD40L abundance is low because of engagement with CD40 on other cells. These observations indicate that the CD40L-CD40 pathway can augment the survival of autoantigen-engaged B cells in the absence of T cell activation. We propose that constitutive CD40L expression by naive CD4 T cells influences the composition of the B cell repertoire and may also affect the homeostasis of other cell types such as regulatory T cells in lymphoid organs.",

        "abstract": "B cell follicles are specialized microenvironments that support events necessary for humoral immunity1, 2, 3. After antigen encounter, activated B cells initially seek T-cell help at the follicle\u2013T-zone boundary and then move to interfollicular and T-zone distal (outer) regions of the follicle4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Subsequently, some cells move to the follicle centre, become germinal centre B cells and undergo antibody affinity maturation1, 2, 11. Although germinal centres within follicles were described in 1885 (ref. 12), the molecular cues mediating segregation of B cells between the outer and centre follicle have remained undefined. Here we present a role for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, Epstein-Barr virus induced molecule-2 (EBI2, also known as GPR183)13, in this process. EBI2 is expressed in mature B cells and increases in expression early after activation, before being downregulated in germinal centre B cells. EBI2 deficiency in mice led to a reduction in the early antibody response to a T-dependent antigen. EBI2-deficient B cells failed to move to the outer follicle at day\u20092 of activation, and instead were found in the follicle centre, whereas EBI2 overexpression was sufficient to promote B cell localization to the outer follicle. In mixed bone marrow chimaeras, EBI2-deficient B\u2009cells phenocopied germinal centre B cells in preferentially localizing to the follicle centre. When downregulation of EBI2 in wild-type B cells was antagonized, participation in the germinal centre reaction was impaired. These studies identify an important role for EBI2 in promoting B cell localization in the outer follicle, and show that differential expression of this receptor helps position B cells appropriately for mounting T-dependent antibody responses.",

Here we have examined the relationship between S1P 1 abundance on the cell and egress efficiency. Using an integrin neutralization approach to separate the processes of entry and exit, we show that pertussis toxin treatment reduces lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes. Retrovirally mediated S1P 1 overexpression is sufficient to reduce B cell accumulation in the splenic white pulp and to promote egress of activated T cells from lymph nodes, whereas S1P 1 \ufffd / \ufffd cells have reduced lymph node exit efficiency. Furthermore, lymphocyte S1P 1 is down-regulated in the blood, up-regulated in lymphoid organs, and down-regulated again in the lymph. We propose that cyclical ligand-induced modulation of S1P 1 on circulating lymphocytes contributes to establishing their lymphoid organ transit time.",

Here we report that FTY720, a drug that targets sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors, induced marginal zone B cell migration into follicles. Marginal zone B cells expressed S1P receptors 1 and 3 (S1P(1) and S1P(3), respectively). Using gene-targeted mice, we show that S1P(1) but not S1P(3) was required for localization in the marginal zone. In mice lacking the chemokine CXCL13, S1P(1)-deficient marginal zone B cells reacquired a marginal zone distribution. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide or antigen caused marginal zone B cells to downregulate S1P(1) and S1P(3) and to migrate into the splenic white pulp. These data suggest that marginal zone B cell localization to the marginal zone depends on responsiveness to the blood lysophospholipid S1P, with S1P(1) signaling overcoming the recruiting activity of CXCL13.",

        "abstract": "Naive lymphocytes continually enter and exit lymphoid organs in a recirculation process that is essential for immune surveillance. During immune responses, the egress process can be shut down transiently1. When this occurs locally it increases lymphocyte numbers in the responding lymphoid organ; when it occurs systemically it can lead to immunosuppression as a result of the depletion of recirculating lymphocytes. Several mediators of the innate immune system are known to cause shutdown, including interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and tumour necrosis factor2, 3, 4, 5, but the mechanism has been unclear. Here we show that treatment with the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 inducer polyinosine polycytidylic acid (hereafter \u2018poly(I:C)\u2019) inhibited egress by a mechanism that was partly lymphocyte-intrinsic. The transmembrane C-type lectin CD69 was rapidly induced and CD69-/- cells were poorly retained in lymphoid tissues after treatment with poly(I:C) or infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Lymphocyte egress requires sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1), and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 was found to inhibit lymphocyte responsiveness to S1P. By contrast, CD69-/- cells retained S1P1 function after exposure to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. In coexpression experiments, CD69 inhibited S1P1 chemotactic function and led to downmodulation of S1P1. In a reporter assay, S1P1 crosslinking led to co-crosslinking and activation of a CD69\u2013CD3\u03b6 chimaera. CD69 co-immunoprecipitated with S1P1 but not the related receptor, S1P3. These observations indicate that CD69 forms a complex with and negatively regulates S1P1 and that it functions downstream of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, and possibly other activating stimuli, to promote lymphocyte retention in lymphoid organs.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive immunity depends on T-cell exit from the thymus and T and B cells travelling between secondary lymphoid organs to survey for antigens. After activation in lymphoid organs, T cells must again return to circulation to reach sites of infection; however, the mechanisms regulating lymphoid organ exit are unknown. An immunosuppressant drug, FTY720, inhibits lymphocyte emigration from lymphoid organs, and phosphorylated FTY720 binds and activates four of the five known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. However, the role of S1P receptors in normal immune cell trafficking is unclear. Here we show that in mice whose haematopoietic cells lack a single S1P receptor (S1P1; also known as Edg1) there are no T cells in the periphery because mature T cells are unable to exit the thymus. Although B cells are present in peripheral lymphoid organs, they are severely deficient in blood and lymph. Adoptive cell transfer experiments establish an intrinsic requirement for S1P1 in T and B cells for lymphoid organ egress. Furthermore, S1P1-dependent chemotactic responsiveness is strongly upregulated in T-cell development before exit from the thymus, whereas S1P1 is downregulated during peripheral lymphocyte activation, and this is associated with retention in lymphoid organs. We find that FTY720 treatment downregulates S1P1, creating a temporary pharmacological S1P1-null state in lymphocytes, providing an explanation for the mechanism of FTY720-induced lymphocyte sequestration. These findings establish that S1P1 is essential for lymphocyte recirculation and that it regulates egress from both thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs.",

However, the properties of SCS macrophages are poorly defined. Here we show SCS macrophage development depended on lymphotoxin-alpha1beta2, and the cells had low lysosomal enzyme expression and retained opsonized antigens on their surface. Intravital imaging revealed immune complexes moving along macrophage processes into the follicle. Moreover, noncognate B cells relayed antigen opsonized by newly produced antibodies from the subcapsular region to the germinal center, and affinity maturation was impaired when this transport process was disrupted. Thus, we characterize SCS macrophages as specialized antigen-presenting cells functioning at the apex of an antigen transport chain that promotes humoral immunity.",

Here we report that a commonly used CD45.1(+) congenic C57BL/6 mouse substrain is characterized by selective deficiency in V\u03b34(+) \u03b3\u03b4T17 cells. This trait was due to a spontaneous mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor Sox13 that caused an intrinsic defect in development of those cells in the neonatal thymus. The \u03b3\u03b4T17 cells migrated from skin to lymph nodes at low rates. In a model of psoriasis-like dermatitis, the V\u03b34(+) \u03b3\u03b4T17 cell subset expanded considerably in lymph nodes and homed to inflamed skin. Sox13-mutant mice were protected from psoriasis-like skin changes, which identified a role for Sox13-dependent \u03b3\u03b4T17 cells in this inflammatory condition.",

        "title": "Loss of signalling via G[agr]13 in germinal centre B-cell-derived lymphoma",
        "abstract": "We sequenced the S1PR2 coding region in 117 GCB-DLBCL, 31 Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma and 68 activated B-cell-like (ABC)-DLBCL samples. Twelve S1PR2 coding mutations were identified in the GCB-DLBCL samples versus one in each of the Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma and ABC-DLBCL cohorts (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The majority of GCB-DLBCL mutations were in conserved transmembrane residues (Fig. 1a) and all were predicted to be structurally damaging. Cell-line transduction experiments showed that five of eight tested mutations disrupted S1PR2 protein expression (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c). These same mutations disrupted S1P-mediated inhibition of CXCL12-induced pAkt and migration (Fig. 1c, d). One additional mutant, R147C, which was expressed at levels similar to wild type (WT) (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1), showed a strongly reduced ability to support S1P-mediated inhibition of pAkt and migration (Fig. 1c, d and Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). These observations suggested that tumours harbouring single mutant S1PR2 alleles (Extended Data Fig. 2) are often likely to be functionally heterozygous for S1PR2. Using a mixed bone-marrow chimaera system in mice3, S1pr2 heterozygous B cells showed marked expansion in the germinal centre (GC) relative to the follicular compartment in mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer\u2019s patches of unimmunized mice (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). Overexpression of WT S1PR2 repressed the outgrowth of S1pr2+/\u2212 GC B cells and this was also seen for mutant R329C, whereas the R147C mutation caused the receptor to lose GC growth suppressive activity (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 3c, d). On the basis of molecular simulation analysis (Supplementary Information and Extended Data Fig. 3e\u2013g) we propose that the R147C S1PR2 mutant cannot attain the active conformation necessary for G-protein recruitment and signalling. G\u03b112 and G\u03b113 often function redundantly in transmitting G-protein-coupled receptor signals8. Transcripts for both G-proteins are upregulated in GC B cells, with Gna13 transcripts appearing more abundant (Extended Data Fig. 4a). In accord with recent whole-exome sequencing studies that reported mutations in GNA13 but not GNA12 (refs 5, 6 and 9, 10, 11), we found frequent GNA13 coding mutations in GCB-DLBCL and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma biopsy samples, with a number of biallelic cases (Supplementary Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2). Analysis of mixed bone-marrow chimaeras revealed that G\u03b113 deficiency was sufficient to confer a GC B-cell growth advantage in mesenteric lymph nodes and to a lesser extent in Peyer\u2019s patches (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 4b). G\u03b113-deficient mesenteric lymph node GC B cells showed increased pAkt relative to WT when incubated ex vivo with CXCL12 and S1P (Fig. 1h). Deficiency in the G\u03b113 effector, Arhgef1 (p115 RhoGEF or Lsc), led to a similar defect in the ability of S1P to repress chemokine induced pAkt (Fig. 1i). To determine whether loss of G\u03b113 in B cells could promote lymphomagenesis, we allowed a cohort of Gna13-deficient mice to age. At 1 year, 10 out of 18 Gna13-deficient mice showed a greater than tenfold expansion of GC B cells compared with littermate controls (Fig. 1j, k), and at least five of the outgrowths appeared clonal (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Three of the Gna13-deficient animals showed massive mesenteric lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1l and data not shown), with evidence in one case (number 307) of spleen and Peyer\u2019s patch involvement (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 4c\u2013e). Immunophenotyping of the G\u03b113-deficient tumours confirmed they were of GC origin (Extended Data Fig. 4f). To test the conservation of the G\u03b113-signalling pathway in human GC B cells, we performed gene rescue experiments in GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Sequencing of S1PR2, GNA13 and ARHGEF1 in a panel of GCB-DLBCL cell lines identified several with deleterious mutations in these genes (Supplementary Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 5a). The mutations in GNA13 matched those previously described and were associated with reduced protein levels6. ARHGEF1 mutations have not previously been reported, probably because the large size (~24 kilobases) of this 27-exon gene and its multiple splice variants and low transcript abundance make sequence analysis difficult. Remarkably, 10 out of 20 cell lines with analysable ARHGEF1 sequence showed mutations in this gene, several of which resulted in premature stop codons (Supplementary Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Using retroviral transduction to restore gene expression, we established that loss of S1PR2, G\u03b113 and ARHGEF1 were each sufficient to disrupt S1P-mediated suppression of pAKT and, in the case of cell lines that were migratory, to disrupt S1P-mediated inhibition of migration (see Supplementary Information and Extended Data Fig. 5). The mechanisms by which malignant GC B cells can exit the GC niche and lymphoid organ to spread among multiple lymph nodes or to systemic sites such as bone marrow have not been defined. Consistent with a lack of migration inhibition by S1P (Fig. 2a), mice lacking G\u03b113 in B cells showed marked disruption of GC architecture in mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 6a). In a mixed transfer system, G\u03b113-deficient GC B cells were excluded from the interior of otherwise WT GCs (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Remarkably, G\u03b113-deficient GC B cells were readily detected in lymph and to a lesser extent in blood while WT GC B cells were absent from circulation (Fig. 2c). In mixed bone-marrow chimaeras, G\u03b113-deficient GC B cells were again detectable in the lymph, indicating that G\u03b113 was needed intrinsically in GC B cells to inhibit egress (Fig. 2d). Analysis of Arhgef1-deficient mice and chimaeras revealed a similar disruption of mesenteric lymph node GC architecture (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 6c) and GC B-cell appearance in lymph and blood (Fig. 2e, f). In contrast, S1PR2-deficient GC B cells were not significantly higher in lymph relative to littermate controls (Fig. 2g). Analysis of mice expressing constitutively active myristoylated Akt (myrAkt) or overexpressing BCL2 in B cells established that increased GC B-cell survival was not sufficient to lead to dissemination (Supplementary Information and Extended Data Fig. 7). GNA13 mutations and BCL2 rearrangements and potentially activating mutations frequently occur together in GCB-DLBCL6, 12. GC B cells in mice with combined G\u03b113 deficiency and BCL2 overexpression showed enhanced ex vivo survival (Fig. 3a), increased numbers (Fig. 3b), wider dispersal throughout the follicle and interfollicular regions in mesenteric lymph nodes (Extended Data Fig. 7f) and twofold increased frequencies in lymph and blood (compare Figs 3c and 2c), compared with cells in G\u03b113-deficient mice. To examine requirements for GC B-cell persistence after arriving at a distant site, we bypassed the egress step and intravenously transferred mesenteric lymph node cells to congenically distinct recipients. Transferred WT GC B cells were essentially undetectable in recipient spleen and bone marrow after 6 hours (Fig. 3d, e) and G\u03b113 deficiency alone was insufficient to cause a significant increase in their number (Fig. 3e). BCL2-overexpression alone caused an elevation in GC B-cell frequency in recipient spleens but not bone marrow (Fig. 3e). Loss of G\u03b113 combined with BCL2-overexpression led to greater accumulation of transferred GC B cells in spleen and now led to an increase in their frequency in bone marrow (Fig. 3e). This combinatorial effect probably reflects an ability of G\u03b113 deficiency and BCL2-overexpression to cooperate in promoting survival of GC B cells outside the GC niche (Fig. 3a). To determine whether GC B cells could seed distant lymph nodes after entry into lymphatics, we transferred mesenteric lymph node cells intraperitoneally. Small numbers of G\u03b113-deficient, but not WT, GC B cells were detectable in the draining parathymic lymph nodes after 6 hours (Fig. 3f). In this case, recovery of G\u03b113-deficient GC B cells was not enhanced by the BCL2 transgene. Bone marrow involvement occurs in a fraction of GCB-DLBCL patients and is a predictor of worse disease13. In some year-old G\u03b113-deficient mice showing mesenteric lymph node tumours, GC B cells could be detected in the bone marrow (Fig. 3g, h). Moreover, in aged BCL2-tg Gna13 knockout (KO) but not BCL2-tg Gna13 WT mice, GC B cells were frequently found in the bone marrow (Fig. 3i). The more frequent mutations of GNA13 than of S1PR2 in both GCB-DLBCL and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, despite the similar size of their open reading frames, together with our finding of Gna13-deficient but not S1pr2-deficient mouse GC B cells in circulation (Fig. 2c, g), led us to hypothesize that additional G\u03b113-coupled G-protein-coupled receptors may be involved in GC B-cell regulation. In this regard, P2YR8, a gene situated in the pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome, was a target of mutations in published whole-exome sequencing data of GCB-DLBCL and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma5, 7, 14 and was frequently mutated in our GCB-DLBCL and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma samples, with several of each lymphoma type carrying biallelic mutations (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2). P2RY8 is an orphan receptor and has orthologues in many vertebrates, but unexpectedly it lacks an orthologue in mouse (Fig. 4b). Like S1PR2, P2RY8 was abundant in human GC B cells (Fig. 4c). Five out of six tested mutations prevented surface P2RY8 expression (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Despite the lack of a mouse P2RY8 orthologue, we considered the possibility that if the ligand were a small molecule it may be conserved, and we therefore asked whether P2RY8 overexpression influenced GC B-cell growth. Remarkably, human P2RY8 led to a suppressive effect on GC B-cell growth in mouse Peyer\u2019s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, similar to the effect of S1PR2 overexpression (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8c). This suppression required P2RY8 coupling to G\u03b113 as it was not seen if the cells lacked Gna13 (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 8d). In short-term transfers, P2RY8-transduced B cells localized in the centre of the follicle immediately around and often within GCs while vector transduced cells were dispersed throughout the follicle (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 8e, f and Supplementary Information). In the absence of G\u03b113, P2RY8 was unable to direct B cells to the follicle centre (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 8g). Importantly, a control G\u03b113-coupled G-protein-coupled receptor, Tbxa2r, could not suppress GC B-cell growth or confine cells to the GC niche (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Information). These observations lead us to suggest that P2RY8 in humans acts to suppress GC B-cell growth and promote B-cell positioning in a GC location via G\u03b113-dependent pathways. GC B cells are normally tightly regulated in their growth and strictly confined to the GC, and they lack the ability to exit into circulation or to survive outside the GC niche. Each of these processes breaks down in the GC B-cell-derived malignancies, GCB-DLBCL and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma. We provide evidence that disruption of G\u03b113 signalling, via mutations in GNA13, ARHGEF1, S1PR2 or P2RY8, contributes to this breakdown. GNA13 is mutated in 15\u201333% of GCB-DLBCL and ~15% of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma6, 7, 9, 10, 11 (Supplementary Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2). This is similar to the frequency of mutations in the histone methyltransferases EZH2 and MLL2, deletions of PTEN and amplifications of miR17-92, genetic alterations that have been highlighted for their role in oncogenesis in GCB-DLBCL15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Our data support a model (Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Information) where deleterious mutations in G\u03b113 and its effector, ARHGEF1, are sufficient to deregulate AKT signalling and to cause loss of confinement, allowing egress of GC B cells into circulation; survival of the disseminating cells at distant sites such as bone marrow depends on co-operating mutations affecting additional genes, such as BCL212, 22. S1PR2 and P2RY8 mutations are also suggested to deregulate AKT signalling and growth but may lead to less dissemination due to overlapping roles in promoting confinement. Potentially inactivating mutations of RHOA, a direct target of ARHGEF123, have been reported in Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma24. The mechanism by which RHOA inhibits AKT activation is not yet defined but might involve activation of PTEN or inhibition of RAC25, 26, 27. We suggest that small molecules that inhibit AKT may replace the missing repressive effects of RHO on growth or survival in cells that harbour defects in the S1PR2/P2RY8\u2013G\u03b113\u2013ARHGEF1\u2013RHO pathway. Development of active RHO-mimetics may represent a novel therapeutic approach that addresses both lymphoma cell survival and disease dissemination. All clinical samples were studied with informed consent according to an institutional review board protocol approved by the National Cancer Institute. Genomic DNA for the single exon coding region of S1PR2 and complementary DNA (cDNA) for GNA13 or ARHGEF1 was amplified by PCR. PCR products were bidirectionally sequenced using an ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence electropherograms were manually reviewed. ARHGEF1 encodes multiple splice variants with up to 28 coding exons per splice variant. We were unable to sequence the open reading frame of ARHGEF1 from cDNA in some cell lines in our panel, probably because of splice variation or insufficient transcript. In some cell lines, regions containing coding exons for ARHGEF1 were amplified from genomic DNA. Primers used for amplification and sequencing are shown in Supplementary Table 4. The following NCBI (RefSeq) accession numbers were used to report mutations: ARHGEF1, NM_004706 and NP_004697; GNA13, NM_006572 and NP_006563; S1PR2, NM_004230 and NP_004221. Adult C57BL6 Ly5.2 (CD45.1+) mice at least 7 weeks of age were from the National Cancer Institute. S1pr2\u2212/\u2212 mice28 were backcrossed for at least six generations to C57BL6/J (B6/J). Arhgef1\u2212/\u2212 mice29 were backcrossed to B6/J for at least six generations. Gna13 f/f mice were on a mixed background30. Mb1-cre mice (provided by M. Reth) express Cre in all B-lineage cells31. BCL2-tg mice were of the E\u00b5Bcl2-22 line32 that overexpresses BCL2 selectively in B cells. MD4 Ig-tg mice were from an internal colony. Mice lacking Gna13 in B cells and littermate controls were generated by crossing mb1-cre + Gna13 f/+ mice to Gna13 f/f. In most experiments, bred mice of both sexes were used and were between 7 and 12 weeks of age except in the ageing cohort of Gna13 animals as indicated. Bone marrow chimaeras were made using Ly5.2 (CD45.1+) from National Cancer Institute as hosts as previously described33 and analysed at least 8 weeks after reconstitution. For one experiment using S1pr2 heterozygous and WT littermate donors, mice were also heterozygous for \u03b2-2-microglobulin. CD21-cre (Cr2-cre) mice expressing Cre in mature B cells were from Jackson Laboratory. The mouse genotype was not blinded from the investigator and mice were not randomized. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment in the Laboratory Animal Research Center at the University of California, San Francisco, and all animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. S1PR2, P2RY8, GNA13, ARHGEF1 retroviral constructs were made by inserting the human open reading frame into the MSCV2.2 retroviral vector followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and Thy1.1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as an expression marker. The mouse Tbxa2r open reading frame was inserted into the Thy1.1 MSCV2.2 retroviral vector. S1PR2, P2RY8 and Tbxa2r were inserted in frame with a preprolactin leader and Flag-epitope encoding sequence. Lymphoma-associated mutations were introduced into S1PR2 or P2RY8 by quick-change PCR. WEHI231 or human lymphoma cell lines engineered to express an ecotropic retroviral receptor34 were spin-infected with retrovirus containing vector, WT or mutant S1PR2, P2RY8, Tbxa2r, GNA13 or ARHGEF1. For transduction of bone marrow, S1pr2 heterozygous or deficient, CD21-cre or Gna13 f/f mb1-cre donor mice were injected intravenously with 3 mg 5-fluorouracil (Sigma). Bone marrow was collected after 4 days and cultured in DMEM containing 15% (v/v) FBS, antibiotics (penicillin (50 IU ml\u22121) and streptomycin (50 \u03bcg ml\u22121); Cellgro) and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (Cellgro), supplemented with IL-3, IL-6 and stem cell factor (at concentrations of 20, 50 or 100 ng ml\u22121, respectively; Peprotech). Cells were \u2018spin-infected\u2019 twice at days 1 and 2 and transferred into irradiated recipients on day 3. Bone marrow chimaeras in which constitutively active myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt) was selectively expressed in B cells were generated by transducing CD21-cre bone marrow with retrovirus in which myr-Akt was downstream of a loxP\u2013stop\u2013loxP cassette3. To generate activated B cells that could be efficiently retrovirally transduced, MD4 Ig-transgenic mice (MGI 2384500) containing lysozyme-specific B cells were injected with 5 mg hen egg lysozyme, splenocytes were harvested 4 h later and the B cells further activated by culturing with 20 \u03bcg ml\u22121 anti-CD40 (FGK4.5; BioXcell) for 24 h as in past studies35. Alternatively, Gpr183+/\u2212 or Gna13 WT or KO spleen cells were harvested in media containing 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 lipopolysaccharide or 0.25 \u03bcg ml\u22121 anti-CD180 (RP-105; clone RP14, BD Biosciences) and cultured for 24 h. Later experiments were performed using anti-CD180 activation as we found it much more effective in achieving high levels of transduction than lipopolysaccharide. The activated B cells were spin-infected for 2 h with retroviral supernatant, and cultured overnight before transfer into SRBC-immunized WT mice. Transferred cells were analysed after 24 h by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. B cells from spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer\u2019s patches and blood were isolated and stained as previously described3. Lymph was collected from the cisterna chyli via fine glass micropipette as previously described36. Assessment of clonality by PCR of J558 heavy chain, and \u03ba and \u03bb light chains, from genomic DNA from bulk mesenteric lymph node cells from year-old mice was performed as previously described37. For adoptive transfer experiments, mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested, washed once and transferred intravenously or intraperitoneally into CD45.1 recipient mice. Spleen and bone marrow were harvested 6 h after intravenous transfer; parathymic lymph nodes were harvested 6 h after intraperitoneal transfer. Harvested organs were analysed by FACS for the presence of donor GC B cells. For GC B-cell positioning experiments in a mixed setting, Gna13 WT or KO CD45.2+ B cells were transferred with WT CD45.1+ B cells into MD4 Ig-tg CD45.1+ recipients. Recipients were then immunized with SRBCs and analysed after 8 days. For pAkt analysis of mesenteric lymph node GC B cells, mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested in RPM-I1640 medium containing 0.5% (w/v) fatty-acid-free BSA (migration media; EMD Biosciences). Cells were RBC lysed twice and re-suspended in migration media. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C and then stimulated for 10 min with CXCL12 (300 ng ml\u22121) or S1P (10 nM). Cells were fixed at a final concentration of 1.5% PFA for 10 min at room temperature of 21\u201323 \u00b0C and then permeabilized in ice-cold methanol. Cells were washed twice in staining buffer, blocked with Fc-block (2.4G2; BioXcell) and 5% normal goat serum for 20 min at room temperature of 21\u201323 \u00b0C, stained for 45 min at room temperature of 21\u201323 \u00b0C for Akt phosphorylated at Ser 473 (D9E, number 4060; Cell Signaling Technology) followed by goat antibody to rabbit IgG conjugated to allophycocyanin (sc-3846; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as well as antibodies to GC markers. For pAkt analysis by flow cytometry in transduced WEHI231 or human GCB-DLBCL lines, cells were stimulated for 5 minutes with or without CXCL12 (100 ng ml\u22121) with or without S1P (1 nM for WEHI-231 or 10 nM for human GCB-DLBCL lines) and fixed and stained as above for pAkt as well as anti-Thy1.1 conjugated to phycoerythrin (clone ox-7; Biolegend). Human cell lines used in this paper were tested for mycoplasma contamination. Mycoplasma-positive lines were treated with MycoZap (Lonza) and Plasmocin (InvivoGen). All human cell lines were tested for a unique profile of polymorphic DNA copy number variants (CNV fingerprint; unpublished protocol from L. Bergsagel). In some experiments, cells were treated with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (Sigma) or GS-1101 (Selleck Chemicals) as negative pAkt staining controls. For active caspase-3 staining, total mesenteric lymph node cells were harvested, washed once and incubated in RPMI-I1640 containing 10% FCS for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C; cells were stained for surface markers, fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm and stained with anti-active caspase-3 conjugated to biotin (clone: C92-605; BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Chemotaxis assays of GC B cells were performed using total mesenteric lymph node cells that were RBC lysed twice or transduced WEHI231 or human GCB-DLBCL lines as described3. U-46619 was from Cayman Chemicals. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur or LSRii (BD Biosciences). For quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression in GC B cells, Ptprc (encoding CD45) was used as a control since its expression was unchanged between follicular and GC B cells by microarray (http://www.immgen.org/ and unpublished data), RNA sequencing analysis (unpublished data) and by surface staining. In contrast, Gapdh and Hprt were both upregulated in GC B cells (http://www.Immgen.org and unpublished data). WEHI231 cells transduced with vector, WT or mutant human S1PR2 were washed twice in migration media and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, washed once in cold PBS and lysed in 0.5% Brij 35, 0.5% NP40, 150mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) for 1 h on ice. Lysates were centrifuged and supernatants were mixed with loading buffer and reducing agent and incubated at room temperature of 21\u201323 \u00b0C for 30 min. Samples were resolved by SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE), and Flag expression was detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-Flag (Sigma). For pAkt western blot experiments, Ly7, Ly8 or WEHI cells that were sorted based on Thy1.1 expression and expanded were stimulated as above and lysed in 2\u00d7 sample buffer, resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and probed with rabbit anti-pAkt S473 (D9E, number 4060; Cell Signaling Technology). Cryosections 7 \u03bcm in thickness from mesenteric lymph node and spleen were cut and prepared as described3. Tumour immunophenotyping was performed using goat polyclonal IRF4 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-6059) or biotinylated anti-mouse CD138 (clone 281-2; BD Biosciences). For Bcl-6 staining, cryosections were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min and stained with rabbit polyclonal Bcl6 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-368). Images were captured with a Zeiss AxioOberver Z1 inverted microscope. Prism software (GraphPad) was used for all statistical analysis. Data were analysed with a two-sample unpaired (or paired, where indicated) Student\u2019s t-test. P values were considered significant when less than 0.05. Download references We thank S.

Here we report that a commonly used CD45.1+ congenic C57BL/6 mouse substrain is characterized by selective deficiency in V\u03b34+ \u03b3\u03b4T17 cells. This trait was due to a spontaneous mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor Sox13 that caused an intrinsic defect in development of those cells in the neonatal thymus. The \u03b3\u03b4T17 cells migrated from skin to lymph nodes at low rates. In a model of psoriasis-like dermatitis, the V\u03b34+ \u03b3\u03b4T17 cell subset expanded considerably in lymph nodes and homed to inflamed skin. Sox13-mutant mice were protected from psoriasis-like skin changes, which identified a role for Sox13-dependent \u03b3\u03b4T17 cells in this inflammatory condition. Download references",

        "abstract": "Immature B cells developing in the bone marrow are found in the parenchyma and sinusoids. The mechanisms that control the positioning of B cells in the sinusoids are not understood. Here we show that the integrin a4b1 (VLA-4) and its ligand VCAM-1 were required, whereas the chemokine receptor CXCR4 was dispensable, for sinusoidal retention of B cells. Instead, cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), a Gai protein-coupled receptor upregulated in immature B cells, was required for sinusoidal retention. Using two-photon microscopy, we found immature B cells entering and crawling in sinusoids; these immature B cells were displaced by CB2 antagonism. Moreover, CB2-deficient mice had a lower frequency of immunoglobulin k-chain-positive B cells in the peripheral blood and spleen. Our findings identify unique requirements for the retention of B cells in the bone marrow sinusoidal niche and suggest involvement of CB2 in the generation of the B cell repertoire.",

        "abstract": "Mice deficient in sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor type 2 (S1P2) develop diffuse large B cell lymphoma. However, the role of S1P2 in normal germinal center (GC) physiology is unknown. Here we show that S1P2-deficient GC B cells outgrew their wild-type counterparts in chronically established GCs. We found that antagonism of the kinase Akt mediated by S1P2 and its downstream mediators G\u03b112, G\u03b113 and p115RhoGEF regulated cell viability and was required for growth control in chronically proliferating GCs. Moreover, S1P2 inhibited GC B cell responses to follicular chemoattractants and helped confine cells to the GC. In addition, S1P2 overexpression promoted the centering of activated B cells in the follicle. We suggest that by inhibiting Akt activation and migration, S1P2 helps restrict GC B cell survival and localization to an S1P-low niche at the follicle center. Download references",

        "abstract": "Peripheral autoantigen binding B cells are poorly competitive with naive B cells for survival and undergo rapid cell death. However, in monoclonal Ig-transgenic mice lacking competitor B cells, autoantigen binding B cells can survive for extended periods. The basis for competitive elimination of autoantigen binding B cells has been unknown. Here we demonstrate that autoantigen binding B cells have increased dependence on BAFF for survival. In monoclonal Ig-transgenic mice, each autoantigen binding B cell receives elevated amounts of BAFF, exhibiting increased levels of NFkappaB p52 and of the prosurvival kinase Pim2. When placed in a diverse B cell compartment, BAFF receptor engagement and signaling are reduced and the autoantigen binding cells are unable to protect themselves from Bim and possibly other death-promoting factors induced by chronic BCR signaling. These findings indicate that under conditions where BAFF levels are elevated, autoantigen-engaged cells will be rescued from rapid competitive elimination, predisposing to the development of autoimmune disease.",

        "abstract": "Lymphocytes egress from lymphoid organs in response to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P); minutes later they migrate from blood into tissue against the S1P gradient. The mechanisms facilitating cell movement against the gradient have not been defined. Here, we show that heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide\u2013binding protein\u2013coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) functions in down-regulation of S1P receptor-1 (S1PR1) on blood-exposed lymphocytes. T and B cell movement from blood into lymph nodes is reduced in the absence of GRK2 but is restored in S1P-deficient mice. In the spleen, B cell movement between the blood-rich marginal zone and follicles is disrupted by GRK2 deficiency and by mutation of an S1PR1 desensitization motif. Moreover, delivery of systemic antigen into follicles is impaired. Thus, GRK2-dependent S1PR1 desensitization allows lymphocytes to escape circulatory fluids and migrate into lymphoid tissues.",

        "abstract": "The tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member HVEM is one of the most frequently mutated surface proteins in germinal center (GC)-derived B\u00a0cell lymphomas. We found that HVEM deficiency increased B cell competitiveness during pre-GC and GC responses. The immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily protein BTLA regulated HVEM-expressing B\u00a0cell responses independently of B-cell-intrinsic signaling via HVEM or BTLA. BTLA signaling into T\u00a0cells through the phosphatase SHP1 reduced T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) signaling and preformed CD40 ligand mobilization to the immunological synapse, thus diminishing the help delivered to B cells. Moreover, T\u00a0cell deficiency in BTLA cooperated with B cell Bcl-2 overexpression, leading to GC B\u00a0cell outgrowth. These results establish that HVEM restrains the T helper signals delivered to B cells to influence GC selection outcomes, and they suggest that BTLA functions as a cell-extrinsic suppressor of GC B cell lymphomagenesis.",

        "abstract": "Germinal centres are important sites for antibody diversification and affinity maturation, and are also a common origin of B cell malignancies. Despite being made up of motile cells, germinal centres are tightly confined within B cell follicles. The cues that promote this confinement are incompletely understood. P2RY8 is a G\u03b1-coupled receptor that mediates the inhibition of migration and regulates the growth of B cells in lymphoid tissues. P2RY8 is frequently mutated in germinal-centre B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma, and the ligand for this receptor has not yet been identified. Here we perform a search for P2RY8 ligands and find P2RY8 bioactivity in bile and in culture supernatants of several mouse and human cell lines. Using a seven-step biochemical fractionation procedure and a drop-out mass spectrometry approach, we show that a previously undescribed biomolecule, S-geranylgeranyl-L-glutathione (GGG), is a potent P2RY8 ligand that is detectable in lymphoid tissues at the nanomolar level. GGG inhibited the chemokine-mediated migration of human germinal-centre B cells and T follicular helper cells, and antagonized the induction of phosphorylated AKT in germinal-centre B cells. We also found that the enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase-5 (GGT5), which was highly expressed by follicular dendritic cells, metabolized GGG to a form that did not activate the receptor. Overexpression of GGT5 disrupted the ability of P2RY8 to promote B cell confinement to germinal centres, which\u00a0indicates that GGT5 establishes a GGG gradient in lymphoid tissues. This work defines GGG as an intercellular signalling molecule\u00a0that is involved in organizing and controlling germinal-centre responses. As the P2RY8 locus is modified in several other types of\u00a0cancer in addition to GCB-DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma, we speculate that GGG might have organizing and growth-regulatory roles in multiple human tissues.",

        "abstract": "Regulatory T cell (T reg cell) numbers and activities are tightly calibrated to maintain immune homeostasis, but the mechanisms involved are incompletely defined. Here, we report that the lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) receptor GPR174 is abundantly expressed in developing and mature T reg cells. In mice that lacked this X-linked gene, T reg cell generation in the thymus was intrinsically favored, and a higher fraction of peripheral T reg cells expressed CD103. LysoPS could act in vitro via GPR174 to suppress T cell proliferation and T reg cell generation. In vivo, LysoPS was detected in lymphoid organ and spinal cord tissues and was abundant in the colon. Gpr174\u2212/Y mice were less susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis than wild-type mice, and GPR174 deficiency in T reg cells contributed to this phenotype. This study provides evidence that a bioactive lipid, LysoPS, negatively influences T reg cell accumulation and activity through GPR174. As such, GPR174 antagonists might have therapeutic potential for promoting immune regulation in the context of autoimmune disease.",

However, the existence of an S1P gradient between lymphoid organs and blood or lymph has not been established. To further define egress requirements, we addressed why treatment with the food colorant 2-acetyl-4-tetrahydroxybutylimidazole (THI) induces lymphopenia. We found that S1P abundance in lymphoid tissues of mice is normally low but increases more than 100-fold after THI treatment and that this treatment inhibits the S1P-degrading enzyme S1P lyase. We conclude that lymphocyte egress is mediated by S1P gradients that are established by S1P lyase activity and that the lyase may represent a novel immunosuppressant drug target.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the response of zebrafish and rare minnow to 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol(EE2) was studied using vitellogenin (Vtg)as a biomarker. Juvenile rare minnow and zebrafish were exposed to waterborne EE2 at 5ng/L,20ng/L and 100ng/L EE2 in laboratory aquaria. After the exposure of 5, 10, 15 days, the fish were sampled to measure Vtg in whole body homogenates (WBH) .The results showed that Vtg levels in juvenile rare minnow increased significantly at 5ng/L,20ng/L and 100ng/L EE2 after 5 days exposure and reached a maximal level on the day 15th. Although Vtg concentration in juvenile zebrafish increased significantly in 100 ng/L EE2 exposure group after 5 days,a significant increase of Vtg in 5ng/L and 20ng/L treatment was just found on the day 15th and on the day 10th respectively. These indicate that rare minnow is more sensitive than zebrafish in Vtg induction to 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol. Zebrafish Vtg was identified in this study. After being separated by SDS-PAGE, zebrafish Vtg produced two protein bands with molecular weights of 140 kDa and 170kDa. Because the development of species-specific methods for its quantification has been hampered due to problems such as the small blood volume and the lack of sufficient pure antigen and specific antibodies, a polyclonal antibody raised against carp Vtg was used as first antibody to measure Vtg in whole body homogenates of zebrafish and rare minnow in this study.The results of western blotting showed that the carp Vtg antibodies cross-reacted with zebrafish Vtg and could be used to measure zebrafish Vtg.",

Significant increases of VTG levels in rare minnow exposed to the 100% influent and primary effluent, the growth and development of the fish were also affected by the influent and primary effluent, and even deaths occurred after 21 days exposure. Using the laboratory-based E2-VTG dose-response data as a standard curve, the VTG responses of rare minnow were calculated to correspond to E2 equivalent concentrations. The removal rates of oestrogens were shown as 47% of the primary treatment ,and over 95% of the secondary treatment process respectively. These results demonstrated the majority of the xenoestrogens could be removed by the secondary treatment process, but not be effectively removed by the primary treatment process. It is suggested that the current Chinese wastewater treatment process should be further improved.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the smoking or age impact on occupational workers in electrical and electronic equipment waste (e-waste) dismantling procedure, using 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the urine as a biomarker for oxidative damage to DNA.The pre-workshift and post-workshift urinary samples of 64 male workers in e-waste dismantling procedure were detected by solid-phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (SPE-HPLC-ECD). The data were statistically analyzed by two factors, age or smoking status.The 8-OHdG levels in non-smokers' urines (n = 42) were higher than those in smokers' urines (n = 22). The levels in pre-workshift urines were detected at (8.25 +/- 4.23) micromol/mol creatinine in non-smokers, while the values were (5.44 +/- 1.18) micromol/mol in smokers. And, the levels in post-workshift were detected at (43.12 +/- 16.19) micromol/mol creatinine in non-smokers, while the values were (14.82 +/- 2.51) micromol/mol in smokers. The 8-OHdG levels in pre-workshift urines were not different between non-smokers and smokers (t = -0.81, P = 0.42), however after 1 day exposure, urinary 8-OHdG levels were significantly increased in non-smokers than those in smokers (t = - 2.33, P < 0.05). On the other hand, the subjects were divided into five groups according to their age. The 8-OHdG levels in pre-workshift urines were (1.86 +/- 0.66), (3.57 +/- 0.54), (8.12 +/- 4.10), (11.39 +/- 3.70) micromol/mol creatinine in < 20 years group (n = 6), 20 -years group (n = 22), 30 - years group ( n = 23), 40 - 49 years group (n = 11) respectively. No effect of age was found on the pre-workshift urinary 8-OHdG levels (F = 0.98, t = 0.41). However, it was found that the post-workshift urinary 8-OHdG levels increased along with the e-waste workers' age (F = 4.81, P = 0.03), and they were (4.19 +/- 2.85), (19.89 +/- 5.26), (28.89 +/- 14.61), (34.94 +/- 12.50) micromol/mol creatinine in < 20 years group, 20 - years group, 30 - years group, 40 - 49 years group respectively.The urinary 8-OHdG levels in the e-waste dismantling workers might be inhibited by smoking status. The post-workshift urinary 8-OHdG levels increased along with the e-waste workers' age.",

The samples were analyzed for PCDD/Fs by HRGC/HRMS-MID according to US EPA 1613B method and were calculated by WHO-TEFs. The total concentrations of PCDD/Fs found in the dusts from the former and the later ESP were 2423.59\u00b1100.01 pg\u00b7g-1 and 157.29\u00b136.83 pg\u00b7g-1 with WHO-TEQ values of 71.67\u00b10.62 pg\u00b7g-1 and 7.50\u00b11.08 pg\u00b7g-1 respectively, meanwhile in the former and the later fly ash the values were 867.492\u00b1215.41 and 170.35\u00b151.12 pg\u00b7N m-3, 36.53\u00b14.47 and 9.13\u00b12.40 pg TEQ\u00b7N m-3,respectively. Moreover, it was found that PCDFs were the dominant congeners, the concentration of which showed a negative correlation with the number of substituted Cl. Among PCDD/Fs congeners, 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran(PeCDF)was found to constitute about 45% of the total WHO-TEQ.The results showed the drying area in sinter belt was suggested to be the main area of dioxins production. Although the concentration of PCDD/Fs in sintering was lower than that in municipal solid waste incinerator, the emission of dioxins from sintering should be gained more attentions due to the huge emission of exhaust gas.",

A poly (methacrylic acid-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) monolithic capillary column was selected as the extraction media, which showed high extraction capacity towards these compounds. To achieve optimum extraction performance, several parameters relating to polymer monolith microextraction were investigated, including extraction flow-rate and pH value, inorganic salt concentration, and organic phase content of the sample matrix. By simple dilution with phosphate solution and filtering, the sample solution could then be directly injected into the extraction device. The limits of detection of testosterone, methyltestosterone, and progesterone were calculated to be 2.3, 2.8 and 4.6 \u03bcg 1 \u22121 , respectively. Good linearity was achieved in the range of 10\u20131000 \u03bcg 1 \u22121 with a linear coefficient r above 0.996. Excellent method reproducibility was found by intra- and inter-day precisions yielding the relative standard deviations of <7.7% and <7.5%, respectively. The recovery for them in real samples was between 83% and 119%.",

        "abstract": "Electronic and electrical waste(E-waste) is a waste type consisting of any broken or unwanted electrical or electronic appliance.Obsolete E-waste has become a serious problem.Many previous studies showed that persistent organic pollutants(POPs) and heavy metals caused serious contamination in air,soil,sediment and freshwater.It is drawing more and more attentions because of its adverse impacts on environment and human health.According to the State Environmental Protection Administration of China,70% of worldwide e-waste has been sent to China.Taizhou region in Zhejiang Province is one of the most intensive E-waste processing sites in China.Polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs) were widely used worldwide as coolants and insulators in electrical capacitors and transformers,and as plasticizers in paint and rubber sealant.Large quantities of PCBs have since entered the environment through leakage,disposal,and evaporation.PCBs stability is also responsible for their continued presence in the environment even decades.Environmental levels of PCBs are traditionally measured as total PCB based on Aroclor equivalent analysis,as opposed to congener-specific concentrations,due to analytical limitations and/or cost differentials.To evaluate the true risk of PCBs to human and ecosystem health,more complex and,in turn,costly Dioxin-Like PCB-specific analytical methods(e.g.,U.S.EPA method 1668a) are available.Dioxin-like PCBs(dl-PCBs) are a group of 12 PCBs that share a common toxic mechanism with the most toxic dioxin compound(i.e.,2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin or 2,3,7,8-TCDD) and generally are among the most toxic PCB congeners as they incur toxic effects at relatively lower concentrations than those of non-dl-PCBs.In the present study,samples of winkle,loach and crucian carp were collected from the e-waste area(Taizhou,Zhejing) in 2006.Dl-PCBs were determined in the samples using isotope dilution Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry(GC/MS) method.Our results showed that the average concentrations of PCBs were 1303.53,3845.00 and 5645.34 ng/g lipid weight in winkle,loach and crucian carp,respectively.Toxic equivalencies(TEQs) were determined to be 1.35,8.44 and 29.18 pg WHO-TEQ/g wet weight in winkle,loach and crucian carp,respectively.TEQs in winkle and crucian carp exceed the European maximum permissible level(2006) of TEQs in fish for human food.In addition,PCB 118 was major congener and constituted 57.73%\u2014 61.22% and 44.27%\u2014 50.61% of total PCBs and TEQs,respectively.Furthermore,PCB 118 was found to have linear correlations to the total PCBs and TEQs.The correlative coefficients(R2) were 0.9988(P<0.0001) and 0.9873(P<0.0001).These results indicated that aquatic organisms from the e-waste area have been seriously contaminated by PCBs which might come from Aroclor 1254 released from E-waste dismantling.",

Then, the exceed-mark-quantity detecting methods were used to detect the PCBs and TEOs level in these samples.The content of PCBs in the samples was different except for piped water. Thediversity of the PCBs level in the hen's eggs was the most significant, duck's eggs took second place and farmland was the least. The order of PCBs level in the samples was: hen' s eggs > duck's eggs > farmland > rice > river water ( stream) > piped water.The content of PCBs in each sample from Town F was higher than town P and town DXG on different levels.

Their recovery rate of standard addition was (65.4\u00b14.0)%-(110.0\u00b14.5)%, and the detection limit was 1.0-7.5 ng/L (relative standard deviation 5.2%-15.6%). The process was applied in a Wuhan wastewater treatment plant for analysis of the 8 estrogenic compounds. It was observed that the concentration of these compounds (except for EE2) in influent was 6.5-8 954.9 ng/L, and the concentration (except for EE2 and E3) in effluent was 3.2-2 473.5 ng/L. The results demonstrate that the current wastewater treatment process shall be further improved.",

METHODS: The experiment was conducted in Neural Pharmacology Laboratory of Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences of Peking University from October to December 2004. A total of 250 male ICR mice were randomly divided into 5 groups: control group, 0.9, 1.8 and 3.6 g/kg yujin groups and positive drugs group (imipramine or diazepam) with 50 mice in each group, and then the 5 groups were subdivided into another 5 groups to perform the forced swimming, tail suspension, locomotor activity, elevated pulse-maze test and the stress induced hyperthermia in single-housed mice, respectively. The yujin capsule was prepared with the dry extract of yujin, suanzaoren, hehuan and yujin with a proportion of 30.5\u223629.5\u223632\u22368 (the sample was provided by the Shijiazhuang Qiyueqi Biological High-Tech Production Co., Ltd. No. 20041017). The evaluation methods and requirements: \u2460The immobility time, which referred to the time of lying on the surface of water or only having a mild movement of limbs with the head above the water of the mice, was measured in the forced swimming test. \u2461Immobility time in tail suspension test referred to the sum of horizontal part of the activity curve in 6 minutes on computer. \u2462In the elevated pulse-maze test, the number of open arm entering and keeping time were recorded. \u2463The change of rectal temperature was measured with electronic clinical thermometer in the stress induced hyperthermia in single-housed mice test. The experimental statistics of the 5 groups were summed up to analyze the antidepressant and anxiolytic effect of compound yujin capsule on mice. RESULTS: All 250 mice were involved in the result analysis. \u2460In forced swimming experiment: The immobility time in 1.8 and 3.6 g/kg yujin groups was 70 and 48 seconds, respectively, which had significant differences compared with the control group (130 seconds, P < 0.05). \u2461In tail suspension test: The immobility time in 1.8 and 3.6 g/kg yujin groups was shorter than the control group (49, 48 and 86 seconds, respectively, P < 0.05). \u2462In elevated pulse-maze test, the keeping time and number of open arm entering in 1.8 and 3.6 g/kg yujin groups were obviously increased compared with the control group (74, 66 and 37 seconds; 8.9, 8.6 and 4.9 times; P < 0.05). \u2463In stress induced hyperthermia in singly-housed mice test: The average temperatures were increased 0.42 \u2103 and 0.37 \u2103, respectively in the 1.8, 3.6 g/kg yujin groups and the control group increased 0.75 \u2103; there were significant differences among them (P < 0.05). \u2464The comparison of the locomotor activity times: It was not increased in the yujin groups at different doses compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that compound yujin capsule appears to be useful in the improvement of depression and anxiety in mice, without increase of locomotor activity.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To explore the analgesic and anti-inflammatiory effects of tetrodotoxin (TTX) alone versus TTX combined with indoxacarb. Methods: The experiment was performed at the Laboratory of Neuropsychopharmacology, Peking University Health Science Center from September 2004 to January 2005. 240 ICR mice were selected and randomly assigned into 24 groups with 10 rats in each group. (1) Writhing test: 110 mice were divided into negative control group, positive control group (morphine, 5 mg/kg), TTX group (0.79, 0.39 and 0.19 \u03bcg/kg), TTX combined with indoxacarb group [TTX (0.19 \u03bcg/kg)+ indoxacarb (1.4, 2.8 and 28 mg/kg), TTX (0.19, 0.39 and 0.79 \u03bcg/kg)+ indoxacarb (5.6 mg/kg)]. 40 minutes after drug administration, the animals were injected by intraperitoneal injection with 6 g/L glacial acetic acid (0.01 mL/g) and the writhing numbers within 15 minutes were recorded. Writhing inhibitive rate (%) was equal to (mean writhing number in the negative control group-mean writhing number in the administration group)/mean writhing number in the negative control group\u00d7100%. (2) Formaldehyde test: Fifty mice were divided into negative control group, positive control group (morphine, 5 mg/kg), TTX group (0.19 \u03bcg/kg), TTX combined with indoxacarb group [TTX (0.19 \u03bcg/kg)+indoxacarb(1.4, 2.8 mg/kg)]. Forty minutes later, formaldehyde (9.2 g/L in saline, 20 \u03bcL/mouse) was injected subcutaneously into the dorsum of the mouse right hindpaw. Duration of licking and biting right claw was used as pain reaction index. The time the animals spent licking the injected hindpaw was observed and recorded between 0 and 5 minutes and 15 and 30 minutes. Inhibitive rate (%) was equal to (mean reaction time in the negative control group-mean reaction time in the administration group)/mean reaction time in the negative control group\u00d7100%. The mice were killed by decapitation 4 hours after formaldehyde injection, and both hindpaws were amputated at the knee joint and weighed to estimate the severity of edema and the difference between the left feet and right feet was compared. (3) Chronic constriction injury (CCI) test: Eighty mice were assigned into negative control group, positive control group (morphine, 5 mg/kg), TTX group (0.19, 0.39 and 0.79 \u03bcg/kg), TTX combined with indoxacarb group [TTX (0.19 \u03bcg/kg) +indoxacarb (1.4, 2.8, 5.6 mg/kg)]. The animals were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (75 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection and a fine copper wire was used for two ligations. Paw withdrawal latencies were measured before any procedure and on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 after ligation procedure. Fifteen days after nerve ligation, the hot plate latencies in mice were measured at minutes 15, 30, 45 and 60 after injection of drugs. Results: 240 mice were involved in the result analysis. (1) At concentrations of 0.19 \u03bcg/kg, 0.39 \u03bcg/kg and 0.79 \u03bcg/kg TTX alone significantly reduced the writhing number in mice with inhibition rates of 22.2%, 31.3% and 39.2%, respectively. The inhibitive rate had dose-dependent effect with concentration. Co-administration of TTX (0.19 \u03bcg/kg) with various dosages of indoxacarb showed increased tendency: 38.6%, 46.1%, 50.6% and 65.3%. (2) At early phase (0-5 minutes), TTX (0.19 \u03bcg/kg) decreased nociceptive response in mice. Combination of TTX and indoxcarb (1.4 mg/kg, 2.8 mg/kg) reduced the time of hindpaw biting with inhibition rates of 49.3% and 50.2% to a similar level as induced by morphine (57.5%). At late phase (15-30 minutes), TTX (0.19 \u03bcg/kg) significantly inhibited nociceptive response in mice. The combination of TTX (0.19 \u03bcg/kg) and indoxcarb (1.4 mg/kg, 2.8 mg/kg) reduced the time of hindpaw biting with high inhibition rates of 97.2% and 92.4%, which was much higher than induced by morphine (79.7%). (3) TTX (0.19 \u03bcg/kg) relieved formaldehyde-induced paw edema in mice by 66.3%. Combination of TTX (0.19 \u03bcg/kg) and indoxacarb (1.4 mg/kg, 2.8 mg/kg) decreased the edema by 75.2% and 124.2%, respectively, which was far better than morphine (28.7%). Morphine treatment had no significant difference from control group. 4 TTX (0.19 \u03bcg/kg) enhanced the changing rate of paw withdraw latency (P < 0.05), and significantly relieved the hyperalgesia in mice induced by sciatic nerve-ligation. No obvious synergistic effect of TTX (0.19 \u03bc/kg) and indoxacarb (1.4, 2.8 and 5.6 mg/kg) in hot plate latency was found in mice. Conclusion: TTX has analgesic effects, can relieve inflammatory edema and pain induced by formaldehyde. Administration of TTX combined with indoxacarb of a small dose reveals a synergistic effect of analgesia and anti-inflammatory.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The development of safe and powerful antidepressant agents from traditional Chinese herbs has become a hotspot in studies on anti-depression therapy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anti-depressive effect and possible mechanism of curcumin by behavioral and neurochemical procedures.DESIGN: Randomized grouping design and controlled experiment. SETTING: Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences of Peking University.MATERIALS: This study was carried out in the laboratory of the Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences of Peking University, between November 2003 and October 2004. A total of 240 male ICR mice were recruited. METHODS: The whole experiment was divided into 4 tests. \u2460 Antagonism of reserpine-induced hypothermia: Totally 60 mice were randomly chosen and divided into 6 groups: normal control group, groups of various doses of curcumin (1.25, 2.50, 5.00 and 10.00 mg/kg), and positive control group (imipramine 10 mg/kg). Normal temperature of the mice was measured before experiment. The animals were given a single injection of reserpine (2.5 mg/kg). The mice were administered with drugs 18 hours later, namely, curcumin of different concentrations by gastric perfusion, groundnut oil (0.1 mL/10g by gastric perfusion) as well as imipramine (10 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection). Rectal temperature was measured 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes after administration, respectively. \u2461 Potentiation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head twitches: animal grouping was the same as above, and the drug in positive control group was replaced by fluoxetine. The mice received gastric perfusion and the dose of curcumin given was the same as above. Groundnut oil and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) and 5-HTP (70 mg/kg) were injected into the vein of the tail one hour later. The number of head twitches was counted within 5-10 minutes after 5-HTP treatment. \u2462 Antagonism of apomorphine-induced hypothermia: Mice grouping was the same as above; the drug in positive control group was replaced by imipramine. Curcumin was give as above at 4 doses, and groundnut oil and imipramine were also given. Large-dose apomorphine was injected subcutaneously (16 mg/kg). Rectal temperature was measured before injection, as well as 30 minutes and 60 minutes after injection. \u2463 Determination of monoamine and metabolites: Mice grouping was the same as above. The drug in positive control group was replaced by imipramine. Curcumin was give as above at 4 doses, and groundnut oil and imipramine were also given. The content of monoamine and metabolites in the mice was measured with high performance liquid chromatography. \u2464 Dunnett's t test was used for comparison between groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: \u2460 In reserpine-induced hypothermia test, the change of body temperature before and after administration. \u2461 In 5-HTP-induced head twitches test, whether the times of head twitches were increased. \u2462 In apomorphine-induced hypothermia test, the change of body temperature after administration. \u2463 Effect of drugs on the content of monoamine.RESULTS: Totally 240 mice entered the result analysis. \u2460 Experiment results of reserpine-induced hypothermia: Curcumin (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) produced an antagonism against reserpine-induced hypothermia, and the results were significantly different from those in control group (P < 0.05, P < 0. 01). Curcumin of 10.00 mg/kg produced the similar effect compared as that of imipramine in positive control group. \u2461 Results of 5-HTP-induced head twitches: Curcumin (5 and 10 mg/kg) could significantly increase the times of 5-HTP-induced head twitches (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). \u2462 Results of apomorphine-induced hypothermia test: 2.50, 5.00 mg/kg and 10.00 mg/kg of curcumin could significantly increase the content of 5-HTP, and 10 mg/kg of curcumin could significantly increase the content of norepinephrine and dopamine. There was significant difference from that in control group (P < 0.05). By contrast, curcumin had no obvious effect on the content of metabolite 5-hydroxyindol acetic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Imipramine of 10 mg/kg as the positive control drug could significantly increase the content of 5-hydroxyindol acetic acid and norepinephrine (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Curcumin has an antidepressant effect and the effect exerted may be related to monoaminergic neurotransmitter system.",

Methods: The experiments were completed in Neuropharmacological Laboratory, Department of Pharmacology, Health Science Center of Peking University from April to May 2004. 1 Twenty normal ICR of half gender and clean grade were selected in this study. 2 Effect of yishenqing on intestinal movement ratio of carbon powder: Forty mice were randomly divided into control group (perfused with 100 g/L arabic gum + 50 g/L carbon powder) and yishenqing groups with high, middle and low doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg, especially (0.1 mL/10 g, consisted of chitosan, ant powder and black fungus with 4:3:3 ratio). The complex was black powder with hydrating and dilatation, and was not dissolved in water and organic solvent. Various doses of complex, such as 50, 100 and 200 g/L, were composed of raw material, 100 g/L arabic gum and 50 g/L carbon powder). Each group was 10 mice. The mice were sacrificed 20 minutes after treatment. The intestine was selected from pyloric orifice to ileocecal junction, the length of the intestine and the carbon powder movement was determined. The carbon powder movement ratio was calculated as: the length of carbon powder movement (cm)/the length of intestine (cm) \u00d7 100%. 3 Effects of yishenqing on defecated function in constipation mice: Forty mice were randomly divided into four groups, yishenqing groups with high, middle and low doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/ kg and model groups with ten in each group. The forty mice were administered with constipating medicine (difen nuozhi, 10 mg/kg) to form the constipation model. After treatment with difen nuozhi for 1 hour, various doses of yishenqing and vehicle (model group) were administered, respectively. The first time of defecation, the number of defecation and the water contents of feces were determined. The water contents of feces (%) were. calculated as [(the quality of humid feces - the quality of dry feces)/ the quality of humid feces \u00d7 100%]. 4 Measurement data were compared with t-test. Results: Eighty mice were used to test with ten mice each group. 1 The intestinal movement ratio of carbon powder: The effects of high and nnddle doses of yishenqing were better than those of control group [(78\u00b18)%, (71\u00b111)%, (60\u00b19)%, P < 0.01, P < 0.05]. The effects of middle doses of yishenqing were the best among all of the groups. The effects of low doses of yishenqing were similar to those of control group [(58\u00b110)%, P > 0.05]. 2 The first time of defecation: The effects of high, middle and low doses of yishenqing were better than those of model group (P < 0.01). 3 The water contents of feces: The effects of high, middle and low doses of yishenqing were better than those of model group (P < 0.05-0.01). 4 The number of defecation: The effects of middle and low doses of yishenqing were better than those of model group (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Yishenqing enhances the intestinal movement, defecation, the number of defecation and the water contents of feces, and ameliorates constipation of mice.",

        "abstract": "Mapping biological pathways across microbial genomes is a highly important technique in functional studies of biological systems. Existing methods mainly rely on sequence-based orthologous gene mapping, which often leads to suboptimal mapping results because sequence-similarity information alone does not contain sufficient information for accurate identification of orthology relationship. Here we present an algorithm for pathway mapping across microbial genomes. The algorithm takes into account both sequence similarity and genomic structure information such as operons and regulons. One basic premise of our approach is that a microbial pathway could generally be decomposed into a few operons or regulons. We formulated the pathway-mapping problem to map genes across genomes to maximize their sequence similarity under the constraint that the mapped genes be grouped into a few operons, preferably coregulated in the target genome. We have developed an integer-programming algorithm for solving this constrained optimization problem and implemented the algorithm as a computer software program, p-map. We have tested p-map on a number of known homologous pathways. We conclude that using genomic structure information as constraints could greatly improve the pathway-mapping accuracy over methods that use sequence-similarity information alone.",

We have developed a computer package EXCAVATOR for clustering gene expression profiles based on our new framework for representing gene expression data as a minimum spanning tree. EXCAVATOR uses a number of rigorous and efficient clustering algorithms. This program has a number of unique features, including capabilities for: (i) data- constrained clustering; (ii) identification of genes with similar expression profiles to pre-specified seed genes; (iii) cluster identification from a noisy background; (iv) computational comparison between different clustering results of the same data set. EXCAVATOR can be run from a Unix/Linux/DOS shell, from a Java interface or from a Web server. The clustering results can be visualized as colored figures and 2-dimensional plots. Moreover, EXCAVATOR provides a wide range of options for data formats, distance measures, objective functions, clustering algorithms, methods to choose number of clusters, etc. The effectiveness of EXCAVATOR has been demonstrated on several experimental data sets. Its performance compares favorably against the popular K-means clustering method in terms of clustering quality and computing time.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of cancer cells fueled by glycolysis produces large amounts of protons in cancer cells, which tri mechanisms to transport them out, hence leading to increased acidity in their extracellular environments. It has been well established that the increased acidity will induce cell death of normal cells but not cancer cells. The main question we address here is: how cancer cells deal with the increased acidity to avoid the activation of apoptosis. We have carried out a comparative analysis of transcriptomic data of six solid cancer types, breast, colon, liver, two lung (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma) and prostate cancers, and proposed a model of how cancer cells utilize a few mechanisms to keep the protons outside of the cells. The model consists of a number of previously, well or partially, studied mechanisms for transporting out the excess protons, such as through the monocarboxylate transporters, V-ATPases, NHEs and the one facilitated by carbonic anhydrases. In addition we propose a new mechanism that neutralizes protons through the conversion of glutamate to \u03b3-aminobutyrate, which consumes one proton per reaction. We hypothesize that these processes are regulated by cancer related conditions such as hypoxia and growth factors and by the pH levels, making these encoded processes not available to normal cells under acidic conditions.",

We have investigated co-expression pattern in four subtypes of ovarian cancer from 104 cancer patients using covariance analysis, treating each subtype of ovarian cancer as a distinct disease entity. We sought gene pairs that were transcriptionally co-expressed in one or multiple subtypes of ovarian cancer, establishing a high confidence network of 87 genes interconnected by significantly high co-expression links that were observed in at least two subtypes of ovarian cancer. We have shown that certain groups of co-expressed gene pairs are cancer subtype specific, through demonstrating significant differences in co-expression patterns of gene pairs between subtypes of ovarian cancer. In addition, we identified a set of 24 genes that classified patients into specific cancer subtypes with a misclassification error rate of less than 5%. Our findings illustrate how large public microarray gene expression datasets could be exploited for identification of cancer subtype specific molecular signatures, and how to classify cancer patients into specific subtypes of cancer using gene expression profiles.",

Existing methods for ncRNA gene prediction rely mostly on homology information, thus limiting their applications to ncRNA genes with known homologues.We present a novel de novo prediction algorithm for ncRNA genes using features derived from the sequences and structures of known ncRNA genes in comparison to decoys. Using these features, we have trained a neural network-based classifier and have applied it to Escherichia coli and Sulfolobus solfataricus for genome-wide prediction of ncRNAs. Our method has an average prediction sensitivity and specificity of 68% and 70%, respectively, for identifying windows with potential for ncRNA genes in E.coli. By combining windows of different sizes and using positional filtering strategies, we predicted 601 candidate ncRNAs and recovered 41% of known ncRNAs in E.coli. We experimentally investigated six novel candidates using Northern blot analysis and found expression of three candidates: one represents a potential new ncRNA, one is associated with stable mRNA decay intermediates and one is a case of either a potential riboswitch or transcription attenuator involved in the regulation of cell division. In general, our approach enables the identification of both cis- and trans-acting ncRNAs in partially or completely sequenced microbial genomes without requiring homology or structural conservation.The source code and results are available at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/publications/materials/tran/.",

        "abstract": "Accurate identification of transcription factor binding sites is critical to our understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks. To overcome the issue of high false-positive predictions that trouble the sequence-based prediction techniques, we have developed a structure-based prediction method that takes into consideration of interactions between the amino acids of a transcription factor and the nucleotides of its DNA binding sequence at structural level, along with an efficient protein-DNA docking algorithm. The docked structures between a protein and a DNA are evaluated using a knowledge-based energy function, in conjunction with van der Waals energy. Our docking algorithm supports quasi-flexible docking, overcoming a number of limiting issues faced by similar docking algorithms. Our rigid-body docking algorithm is tested on a dataset of 141 nonredundant transcription factor-DNA complex structures. The test results show that 63.1% of the 141 complex structures are reconstructed with accuracies better than 1.0 A RMSDs (root mean square deviation) and 79.4% of the complexes are predicted with accuracies better than 3.0 A RMSDs when using the native DNA structures. Our quasi-flexible docking algorithm, assuming that the DNA structures are not known, is tested on a separate set of 45 transcription factor-DNA complexes, of which 57.8% of the docked complex conformations achieve better than 1.0 A RMSDs while 71.1% of the complexes have RMSDs less than 3.0 A. We have also applied our method to predict the binding motifs of the ferric uptake regulator in E. coli and showed that most of the experimentally identified sites can be predicted accurately.",

        "abstract": "An important but difficult problem in proteomics is the identification of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in a protein. In general, the process of PTM identification by aligning experimental spectra with theoretical spectra from peptides in a peptide database is very time consuming and may lead to high false positive rate. In this paper, we introduce a new approach that is both efficient and effective for blind PTM identification. Our work consists of the following phases. First, we develop a novel tree decomposition based algorithm that can efficiently generate peptide sequence tags (PSTs) from an extended spectrum graph. Sequence tags are selected from all maximum weighted antisymmetric paths in the graph and their reliabilities are evaluated with a score function. An efficient deterministic finite automaton (DFA) based model is then developed to search a peptide database for candidate peptides by using the generated sequence tags. Finally, a point process model-an efficient blind search approach for PTM identification, is applied to report the correct peptide and PTMs if there are any. Our tests on 2657 experimental tandem mass spectra and 2620 experimental spectra with one artificially added PTM show that, in addition to high efficiency, our ab-initio sequence tag selection algorithm achieves better or comparable accuracy to other approaches. Database search results show that the sequence tags of lengths 3 and 4 filter out more than 98.3% and 99.8% peptides respectively when applied to a yeast peptide database. With the dramatically reduced search space, the point process model achieves significant improvement in accuracy as well.The software is available upon request.",

        "abstract": "De novo sequencing and spectral alignment are computationally important for the prediction of new protein peptides via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Both approaches are established upon the problem of finding the longest antisymmetric path on formulated graphs. The problem is of high computational complexity and the prediction accuracy is compromised when given spectra involve noisy data, missing mass peaks, or post translational modifications (PTMs) and mutations. This paper introduces a graphical mechanism to describe relationships among mass peaks that, through graph tree decomposition, yields linear and quadratic time algorithms for optimal de novo sequencing and spectral alignment respectively. Our test results show that, in addition to high efficiency, the new algorithms can achieve desired prediction accuracy on spectra containing noisy peaks and PTMs while allowing the presence of both b-ions and y-ions.",

        "abstract": "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugars (NDP-sugars) are the building blocks of diverse polysaccharides and glycoconjugates in all organisms. In plants, 11 families of NDP-sugar interconversion enzymes (NSEs) have been identified, each of which interconverts one NDP-sugar to another. While the functions of these enzyme families have been characterized in various plants, very little is known about their evolution and origin. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that all the 11 plant NSE families are distantly related and most of them originated from different progenitor genes, which have already diverged in ancient prokaryotes. For instance, all NSE families are found in the lower land plant mosses and most of them are also found in aquatic algae, implicating that they have already evolved to be capable of synthesizing all the 11 different NDP-sugars. Particularly interesting is that the evolution of RHM (UDP-L-rhamnose synthase) manifests the fusion of genes of three enzymatic activities in early eukaryotes in a rather intriguing manner. The plant NRS/ER (nucleotide-rhamnose synthase/epimerase-reductase), on the other hand, evolved much later from the ancient plant RHMs through losing the N-terminal domain. Based on these findings, an evolutionary model is proposed to explain the origin and evolution of different NSE families. For instance, the UGlcAE (UDP-D-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase) family is suggested to have evolved from some chlamydial bacteria. Our data also show considerably higher sequence diversity among NSE-like genes in modern prokaryotes, consistent with the higher sugar diversity found in prokaryotes. All the NSE families are widely found in plants and algae containing carbohydrate-rich cell walls, while sporadically found in animals, fungi and other eukaryotes, which do not have or have cell walls with distinct compositions. Results of this study were shown to be highly useful for identifying unknown genes for further experimental characterization to determine their functions in the synthesis of diverse glycosylated molecules.",

        "abstract": "We present a computational study for prediction of cis regulatory elements. We model the problem as follows. Each set of conserved binding motifs, evolved from one common ancestor, have a short (Hamming) distance from this ancestor. The problem is to identify a set of l -mers from a given set of promoter sequences which have at most k different positions from the to-beidentified ancestor. A number of papers published in the past attempt to solve this challenging problem. Although the putative ancestor is unknown, even it does not appear in whole background database, we may assume that an instance of it at hand since we can guess it. Our main contribution in this paper is to develop an algorithm, named PROMOCO (PROfile Motif Collection), to find a profile containing all the motifs and relatively small number of random l -mers so that the consensus of the profile would be the putative ancestor. The key idea of the PROMOCO algorithm lies in a new distance measure. Two classes of computational approaches have been developed and widely used for prediction of cis regulatory elements. One class of methods essentially treat the identification problem of cis regulatory elements as identification of a group of l -mers that exhibit high-information content when aligned. Another class of methods solve the problem through identification of cliques in a graph representation of l -mers where a pair of l -mers are linked by an edge if and only if their (Hamming) distance is below some predefined threshold. While intuitively similar, the detailed relationship between these two classes of algorithms has not been carefully investigated. We present a computational study for prediction of cis regulatory elements. We model the problem as follows. Each set of conserved binding motifs, evolved from one common ancestor, have a short (Hamming) distance from this ancestor. The problem is to identify a set of l -mers from a given set of promoter sequences which have at most different positions from the to-beidentified",

        "abstract": "We study a constrained bipartite matching problem where the input is a weighted bipartite graph G=(U,V,E), U is a set of vertices following a sequential order, V is another set of vertices partitioned into a collection of disjoint subsets, each following a sequential order, and E is a set of edges between U and V with non-negative weights. The objective is to find a matching in G with the maximum weight that satisfies the given sequential orders on both U and V, i.e. if ui+1 follows ui in U and if vj+1 follows vj in V, then ui is matched with vj if and only if ui+1 is matched with vj+1. The problem has recently been formulated as a crucial step in an algorithmic approach for interpreting NMR spectral data (IEEE Comput. Sci. Eng. 4 (2002) 50\u00bf62). The interpretation of NMR spectral data is known as a key problem in protein structure determination via NMR spectroscopy. Unfortunately, the constrained bipartite matching problem is NP-hard (IEEE Comput. Sci. Eng. 4 (2002) 50\u00bf62). We first propose a 2-approximation algorithm for the problem, which follows directly from the recent result of Bar-Noy et al. (Proc. 32nd ACM Symp. on Theory of Computing (STOC\u00bf00), 2000, pp. 735\u00bf744) on interval scheduling. However, our extensive experimental results on real NMR spectral data illustrate that the algorithm performs poorly in terms of recovering target-matching edges. We then propose another approximation algorithm that tries to take advantage of the \u201cdensity\u201d of the sequential order information in V. Although we are only able to prove an approximation ratio of 3log2D for this algorithm, where D is the length of a longest string in V, the experimental results demonstrate that this new algorithm performs much better on real data, i.e. it is able to recover a large fraction of target-matching edges and the weight of its output matching is often in fact close to the maximum. We also prove that the problem is MAX SNP-hard, even if the input bipartite graph is unweighted. We further present an approximation algorithm for a nontrivial special case that breaks the ratio 2 barrier.",

        "abstract": "We present a study on computational identification of uber-operons in a prokaryotic genome, each of which represents a group of operons that are evolutionarily or functionally associated through operons in other (reference) genomes. Uber-operons represent a rich set of footprints of operon evolution, whose full utilization could lead to new and more powerful tools for elucidation of biological pathways and networks than what operons have provided, and a better understanding of prokaryotic genome structures and evolution. Our prediction algorithm predicts uber-operons through identifying groups of functionally or transcriptionally related operons, whose gene sets are conserved across the target and multiple reference genomes. Using this algorithm, we have predicted uber-operons for each of a group of 91 genomes, using the other 90 genomes as references. In particular, we predicted 158 uber-operons in Escherichia coli K12 covering 1830 genes, and found that many of the uber-operons correspond to parts of known regulons or biological pathways or are involved in highly related biological processes based on their Gene Ontology (GO) assignments. For some of the predicted uber-operons that are not parts of known regulons or pathways, our analyses indicate that their genes are highly likely to work together in the same biological processes, suggesting the possibility of new regulons and pathways. We believe that our uber-operon prediction provides a highly useful capability and a rich information source for elucidation of complex biological processes, such as pathways in microbes. All the prediction results are available at our Uber-Operon Database: http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/uber, the first of its kind.",

Characterization\n of proteins in the late nineteenth century likewise focused on the ability of proteins to precipitate in response to certain\n salts and to aggregate in response to heating. Investigations by Chick and Martin (Chick and Martin, 1910) showed that the\n inactivating response of proteins to heat or solvent treatment is a two-step process involving separate denaturation and precipitation\n steps. Monitoring the coagulation and flocculation responses of proteins to heat and other stresses remained a major approach\n to understanding protein structure for decades, with solubility, or susceptibility to aggregation, serving as a kind of benchmark\n against which results of other methods, such as viscosity, chemical susceptibility, immune activity, crystallizability, and\n susceptibility to proteolysis, were compared (Mirsky and Pauling, 1936;Wu, 1931). Toward the middle of the last century, protein\n aggregation studies were largely left behind, as improved methods allowed elucidation of the primary sequence of proteins,\n reversible unfolding studies, and ultimately high-resolution structures. Curiously, the field of protein science, and in particular\n protein folding, is now gravitating back to a closer look at protein aggregation and protein aggregates. Unfortunately, the\n means developed during the second half of the twentieth century for studying native, globular proteins have not proved immediately\n amenable to the study of aggregate structures. Great progress is being made, however, to modify classical methods, including\n NMR and X-ray diffraction, as well as to develop newer techniques, that together should continue to expand our picture of\n aggregate structure (Kheterpal and Wetzel, 2006; Wetzel, 1999).\n ",

        "abstract": "Phages are present wherever life is found, and play roles in many biogeochemical and ecological processes. The thermophilic bacteriophages, however, have not been well studied. In this study, phage GBSV1 was obtained from a thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus sp. 6k51 isolated from a hot spring. GBSV1 contains a double-stranded linear DNA of 34,683bp, which encodes 54 putative open reading frames (ORFs). Thirty three of these 54 ORFs exhibit sequence similarities to genes from 7 species of Geobacillus or Bacillus bacteria, as well as of bacteriophages infecting these bacteria. Twenty-two ORFs have been functionally annotated based on both their sequence similarities to known genes and predicted Pfam protein domains. Five structural proteins of the purified GBSV1 virion have been identified by proteomic analyses. Surprisingly, 7 of the GBSV1 ORFs share sequence similarities with genes from bacteria relevant to human diseases. This is the first report that genes of human disease-inducing bacteria are found in a thermophilic phage. It is suggested that thermophilic phages may be the potential evolutionary link between thermophiles and human pathogens. The characterization of GBSV1 may possibly lead to new insights into virus-host interactions and to a better understanding of gene transfers and evolution of life on earth in general.",

        "title": "Prediction of cis-regulatory elements: from high-information content analysis to motif identification.",
        "abstract": "One popular approach to prediction of binding motifs of transcription factors is to model the problem as to search for a group of l-mers (motifs), for some l > 0, one from each of the provided promoter regions of a group of co-expressed genes, that exhibit high information content when aligned without gaps. In our current work, we assume that these desired l-mers have evolved from a common ancestor, each of which has mutations in at most k-positions from the common ancestor, where k is substantially smaller than l. This implies that these l-mers should belong to the k-neighborhood of their common ancestor, measured in terms of Hamming distance. If the ancestor is given, then the problem for finding these l-mers becomes trivial. Unfortunately, the problem of identifying the unknown ancestor is probably as hard as the problem of predicting the motifs themselves. Our goal is to identify a set of l-mers that slightly violate the k-neighborhood of a putative ancestor, but capture all the desired motifs, which will lead to an efficient way for identification of the desired motifs. The main contributions of this paper are in four aspects: (a) we have derived nontrivial lower and upper bounds of information content for a set of l-mers that differ from an unknown ancestor in no more than k positions; (b) we have defined a new distance between two sequences and a k-pseudo-neighborhood, based on the new distance, that contains the k-neighborhood, defined by Hamming distance, of the to-be-defined ancestor; (c) we have developed an algorithm to minimize the sum of all the distances between a predicted ancestor motif and a group of l-mers from the provided promoter regions, using the new distance; and (d) we have tested PROMOCO and compared its prediction results performance with two other prediction programs. The algorithm, implemented as a computer software program PROMOCO, has been used to find all conserved motifs in a set of provided promoter sequences. Our preliminary application of PROMOCO shows that it achieves better or comparable prediction results, when compared to popular programs for identification of cis regulatory binding motifs. A limitation of the algorithm is that it does not work well when the size of the set of provided promoter sequences is too small or when desired motifs appear in only small portion of the given sequences.",

Further examination for the discerning power of all k-feature combinations indicated a 5-feature combination, ALB+CK+Cr+HDL+CA125+TB, which gave the best accuracy, 79.71%, in classifying all training data into the 2 subtypes of nephropathy. Moreover, two combinations, ALB+CK+AFP+AST and TP+Glu+DB+CH, were gender-specific, giving the best classification accuracies of 81.90% and 80.22% for male and female patients, respectively. These 3 classifiers achieved classification accuracies of 75.36%, 72.00% and 84.09% in the entire, the male and the female independently validated datasets, respectively.Blood biochemical indicators could distinguish between IgAN and non-IgAN cases with a bioinformatic algorithm, providing a promising method to diagnose the subtypes of nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "We present a web-based network-construction system, CINPER (CSBL INteractive Pathway BuildER), to assist a user to build a user-specified gene network for a prokaryotic organism in an intuitive manner. CINPER builds a network model based on different types of information provided by the user and stored in the system. CINPER's prediction process has four steps: (i) collection of template networks based on (partially) known pathways of related organism(s) from the SEED or BioCyc database and the published literature; (ii) construction of an initial network model based on the template networks using the P-Map program; (iii) expansion of the initial model, based on the association information derived from operons, protein-protein interactions, co-expression modules and phylogenetic profiles; and (iv) computational validation of the predicted models based on gene expression data. To facilitate easy applications, CINPER provides an interactive visualization environment for a user to enter, search and edit relevant data and for the system to display (partial) results and prompt for additional data. Evaluation of CINPER on 17 well-studied pathways in the MetaCyc database shows that the program achieves an average recall rate of 76% and an average precision rate of 90% on the initial models; and a higher average recall rate at 87% and an average precision rate at 28% on the final models. The reduced precision rate in the final models versus the initial models reflects the reality that the final models have large numbers of novel genes that have no experimental evidences and hence are not yet collected in the MetaCyc database. To demonstrate the usefulness of this server, we have predicted an iron homeostasis gene network of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 using the server. The predicted models along with the server can be accessed at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/cinper/.",

        "abstract": "Computational evaluation of protein-DNA interaction is important for the identification of DNA-binding sites and genome annotation. It could validate the predicted binding motifs by sequence-based approaches through the calculation of the binding affinity between a protein and DNA. Such an evaluation should take into account structural information to deal with the complicated effects from DNA structural deformation, distance-dependent multi-body interactions and solvation contributions. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based potential built on interactions between protein residues and DNA tri-nucleotides. The potential, which explicitly considers the distance-dependent two-body, three-body and four-body interactions between protein residues and DNA nucleotides, has been optimized in terms of a Z-score. We have applied this knowledge-based potential to evaluate the binding affinities of zinc-finger protein-DNA complexes. The predicted binding affinities are in good agreement with the experimental data (with a correlation coefficient of 0.950). On a larger test set containing 48 protein-DNA complexes with known experimental binding free energies, our potential has achieved a high correlation coefficient of 0.800, when compared with the experimental data. We have also used this potential to identify binding motifs in DNA sequences of transcription factors (TF). The TFs in 79.4% of the known TF-DNA complexes have accurately found their native binding sequences from a large pool of DNA sequences. When tested in a genome-scale search for TF-binding motifs of the cyclic AMP regulatory protein (CRP) of Escherichia coli, this potential ranks all known binding motifs of CRP in the top 15% of all candidate sequences.",

Design of highly efficient and specific siRNAs has become a challenging issue in applications of RNAi. Here, we present a detailed survey on the state-of-the-art siRNAs design, focusing on several key issues with the current in silico RNAi studies, including: (i) inconsistencies among the proposed guidelines for siRNAs design and the incomplete list of siRNAs features, (ii) improper integration of the heterogeneous cross-platform siRNAs data, (iii) inadequate consideration of the binding specificity of the target mRNAs and (iv) reduction in the 'off-target' effect in siRNAs design. With these considerations, the popular in silico siRNAs design rules are reexamined and several inconsistent viewpoints toward siRNAs feature identifications are clarified. In addition, novel computational models for siRNAs design using state-of-art machine learning techniques are discussed, which focus on heterogeneous data integration, joint feature selection and customized siRNAs screening toward highly specific targets. We believe that addressing such issues in siRNA study will provide new clues for further improved design of more efficient and specific siRNAs in RNAi.",

        "abstract": "Residual dipolar coupling (RDC) represents one of the most exciting emerging NMR techniques for studying protein structures. However, solving a protein structure using RDC data alone is a highly challenging problem as it often requires that the starting structure model be close to the actual structure of a protein, for the structure calculation procedure to be effective. We report in this paper a computer program, RDC-PROSPECT, for identification of a structural homolog or analog of a target protein in PDB, which best matches the 15N-1H RDC data of the protein recorded in a single ordering medium. The identified structural homolog/analog can then be used as a starting model for RDC-based structure calculation. Since RDC-PROSPECT uses only RDC data and predicted secondary structure information, its performance is virtually independent of sequence similarity between a target protein and its structural homolog/analog, making it applicable to protein targets out of the scope of current protein threading techniques. We have tested RDC-PROSPECT on all 15N-1H RDC data (representing 33 proteins) available in the BMRB database and the literature. The program correctly identified the structural folds for approximately 80% of the target proteins, significantly better than previously reported results, and achieved an average alignment accuracy of 97.9% residues within 4-residue shift. Through a careful algorithmic design, RDC-PROSPECT is at least one order of magnitude faster than previously reported algorithms for principal alignment frame search, making our algorithm fast enough for large-scale applications.",

        "abstract": "Protein NMR peak assignment refers to the process of assigning a group of \"spin systems\" obtained experimentally to a protein sequence of amino acids. The automation of this process is still an unsolved and challenging problem in NMR protein structure determination. Recently, protein NMR peak assignment has been formulated as an interval scheduling problem (ISP), where a protein sequence P of amino acids is viewed as a discrete time interval I (the amino acids on P one-to-one correspond to the time units of I), each subset S of spin systems that are known to originate from consecutive amino acids from P is viewed as a \"job\" j(s), the preference of assigning S to a subsequence P of consecutive amino acids on P is viewed as the profit of executing job j(s) in the subinterval of I corresponding to P, and the goal is to maximize the total profit of executing the jobs (on a single machine) during I. The interval scheduling problem is max SNP-hard in general; but in the real practice of protein NMR peak assignment, each job j(s) usually requires at most 10 consecutive time units, and typically the jobs that require one or two consecutive time units are the most difficult to assign/schedule. In order to solve these most difficult assignments, we present an efficient 13/7-approximation algorithm for the special case of the interval scheduling problem where each job takes one or two consecutive time units. Combining this algorithm with a greedy filtering strategy for handling long jobs (i.e., jobs that need more than two consecutive time units), we obtain a new efficient heuristic for protein NMR peak assignment. Our experimental study shows that the new heuristic produces the best peak assignment in most of the cases, compared with the NMR peak assignment algorithms in the recent literature. The above algorithm is also the first approximation algorithm for a nontrivial case of the well-known interval scheduling problem that breaks the ratio 2 barrier.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel computational method for predicting which proteins from highly and abnormally expressed genes in diseased human tissues, such as cancers, can be secreted into the bloodstream, suggesting possible marker proteins for follow-up serum proteomic studies. A main challenging issue in tackling this problem is that our understanding about the downstream localization after proteins are secreted outside the cells is very limited and not sufficient to provide useful hints about secretion to the bloodstream. To bypass this difficulty, we have taken a data mining approach by first collecting, through extensive literature searches, human proteins that are known to be secreted into the bloodstream due to various pathological conditions as detected by previous proteomic studies, and then asking the question: 'what do these secreted proteins have in common in terms of their physical and chemical properties, amino acid sequence and structural features that can be used to predict them?' We have identified a list of features, such as signal peptides, transmembrane domains, glycosylation sites, disordered regions, secondary structural content, hydrophobicity and polarity measures that show relevance to protein secretion. Using these features, we have trained a support vector machine-based classifier to predict protein secretion to the bloodstream. On a large test set containing 98 secretory proteins and 6601 non-secretory proteins of human, our classifier achieved approximately 90% prediction sensitivity and approximately 98% prediction specificity. Several additional datasets are used to further assess the performance of our classifier. On a set of 122 proteins that were found to be of abnormally high abundance in human blood due to various cancers, our program predicted 62 as blood-secreted proteins. By applying our program to abnormally highly expressed genes in gastric cancer and lung cancer tissues detected through microarray gene expression studies, we predicted 13 and 31 as blood secreted, respectively, suggesting that they could serve as potential biomarkers for these two cancers, respectively. Our study demonstrated that our method can provide highly useful information to link genomic and proteomic studies for disease biomarker discovery.

Our predicted IS maps are consistent with the NCBI annotations of the IS elements. By linking the predicted IS elements to various characteristics of the organisms under study and the organism's living conditions, we found that (a) the activities of IS elements heavily depend on the environments where the host organisms live; (b) the number of recently active IS elements in a genome tends to increase with the genome size; (c) the flanking regions of the recently active IS elements are significantly enriched with genes encoding DNA binding factors, transporters and enzymes; and (d) IS movements show no tendency to disrupt operonic structures.This is the first genome-scale maps of IS elements with detailed structural information on the sequence level. These genetic maps of recently active IS elements and the several interesting observations would help to improve our understanding of how IS elements proliferate and how they are involved in the evolution of the host genomes.",

        "abstract": "We have carried out a systematic analysis of the contribution of a set of selected features that include three new features to the accuracy of operon prediction. Our analyses have led to a number of new insights about operon prediction, including that (i) different features have different levels of discerning power when used on adjacent gene pairs with different ranges of intergenic distance, (ii) certain features are universally useful for operon prediction while others are more genome-specific and (iii) the prediction reliability of operons is dependent on intergenic distances. Based on these new insights, our newly developed operon-prediction program achieves more accurate operon prediction than the previous ones, and it uses features that are most readily available from genomic sequences. Our prediction results indicate that our (non-linear) decision tree-based classifier can predict operons in a prokaryotic genome very accurately when a substantial number of operons in the genome are already known. For example, the prediction accuracy of our program can reach 90.2 and 93.7% on Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli genomes, respectively. When no such information is available, our (linear) logistic function-based classifier can reach the prediction accuracy at 84.6 and 83.3% for E.coli and B.subtilis, respectively.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we present data that support the presence of two distinct calmodulin binding sites within the angiotensin II receptor (AT1A), at juxtamembrane regions of the N-terminus of the third intracellular loop (i3, amino acids 214-231) and carboxyl tail of the receptor (ct, 302-317). We used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays to document interactions of calmodulin with the AT1A holo-receptor and GST-fusion protein pull-downs to demonstrate that i3 and ct interact with calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. The former is a 1-12 motif and the latter belongs to 1-5-10 calmodulin binding motif. The apparent Kd of calmodulin for i3 is 177.0\u00b19.1 nM, and for ct is 79.4\u00b17.9 nM as assessed by dansyl-calmodulin fluorescence. Replacement of the tryptophan (W219) for alanine in i3, and phenylalanine (F309 or F313) for alanine in ct reduced their binding affinities for calmodulin, as predicted by computer docking simulations. Exogenously applied calmodulin attenuated interactions between G protein \u03b2\u03b3 subunits and i3 and ct, somewhat more so for ct than i3. Mutations W219A, F309A, and F313A did not alter G\u03b2\u03b3 binding, but reduced the ability of calmodulin to compete with G\u03b2\u03b3, suggesting that calmodulin and G\u03b2\u03b3 have overlapping, but not identical, binding requirements for i3 and ct. Calmodulin interference with the G\u03b2\u03b3 binding to i3 and ct regions of the AT1A receptor strongly suggests that calmodulin plays critical roles in regulating G\u03b2\u03b3-dependent signaling of the receptor. \u00a9 2013 Zhang et al.",

        "abstract": "Deciphering the regulatory networks encoded in the genome of an organism represents one of the most interesting and challenging tasks in the post-genome sequencing era. As an example of this problem, we have predicted a detailed model for the nitrogen assimilation network in cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. WH 8102 (WH8102) using a computational protocol based on comparative genomics analysis and mining experimental data from related organisms that are relatively well studied. This computational model is in excellent agreement with the microarray gene expression data collected under ammonium-rich versus nitrate-rich growth conditions, suggesting that our computational protocol is capable of predicting biological pathways/networks with high accuracy. We then refined the computational model using the microarray data, and proposed a new model for the nitrogen assimilation network in WH8102. An intriguing discovery from this study is that nitrogen assimilation affects the expression of many genes involved in photosynthesis, suggesting a tight coordination between nitrogen assimilation and photosynthesis processes. Moreover, for some of these genes, this coordination is probably mediated by NtcA through the canonical NtcA promoters in their regulatory regions.",

Computational methods have been developed to identify PAIs based on the distinguishing G+C levels in some PAI versus non-PAI regions. We observed that PAIs can have a very similar G+C level to that of the host chromosome, which may have led to false negative predictions using these methods. We have applied a novel method of genomic barcodes to identify PAIs. Using this technique, we have successfully identified both known and novel PAIs in the genomes of three strains of EHEC O157:H7.",

Methods for accurate identification of ion types provide the basis for many mass spectrometry data interpretation problems, including (a) de novo sequencing, (b) identification of post-translational modifications and mutations and (c) validation of database search results.Here, we present a novel graph-theoretic approach for solving the problem of separating b ions from y ions in a set of tandem mass spectra. We represent each spectral peak as a node and consider two types of edges: type-1 edge connecting two peaks probably of the same ion types and type-2 edge connecting two peaks probably of different ion types. The problem of ion-separation is formulated and solved as a graph partition problem, which is to partition the graph into three subgraphs, representing b, y and others ions, respectively, through maximizing the total weight of type-1 edges while minimizing the total weight of type-2 edges within each partitioned subgraph. We have developed a dynamic programming algorithm for rigorously solving this graph partition problem and implemented it as a computer program PRIME (PaRtition of Ion types in tandem Mass spEctra). The tests on a large amount of simulated mass spectra and 19 sets of high-quality experimental Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance tandem mass spectra indicate that an accuracy level of approximately 90% for the separation of b and y ions was achieved.The executable code of PRIME is available upon request.xyn@bmb.uga.edu.",

        "abstract": "Identifying operons at the whole genome scale of microbial organisms can facilitate deciphering of transcriptional regulation, biological networks and pathways. A number of computational methods, such as naive Bayesian and neural network approaches, have been employed for operon prediction to whole genome sequences of a number of prokaryotic organisms, based on features known to be associated with operons, such as intergenic distance, microarray expression data, phylogenetic profiles, clusters of orthologous groups (COG). In this paper, we introduce a decision tree approach to predict operon structures using three effective types of genomic data: intergenic distance, gene order conservation and COG. We calculated and analyzed frequency distributions of each attribute of known operons and non-operons of Escherichia coli (E. coli) K12 and Bacillus subtilis (R subtilis) 168, and constructed decision trees based on training examples to predict operons. The overall prediction accuracy is 94.1% for E. coli K12 and 91.0% for B. subtilis 168. We also applied four other classifiers, logistic regression, naive Bayesian, neural network and support vector machines on both organisms. The results indicate that the decision tree approach is the best classifier for operon prediction. The software package operonDT is freely available at http://www.cs.uga.edn/~che/OperonT",

        "abstract": "Large sets of bioinformatical data provide a challenge in time consumption while solving the cluster identification problem, and that is why a parallel algorithm is so needed for identifying dense clusters in a noisy background. Our algorithm works on a graph representation of the data set to be analyzed. It identifies clusters through the identification of densely intraconnected subgraphs. We have employed a minimum spanning tree (MST) representation of the graph and solve the cluster identification problem using this representation. The computational bottleneck of our algorithm is the construction of an MST of a graph, for which a parallel algorithm is employed. Our high-level strategy for the parallel MST construction algorithm is to first partition the graph, then construct MSTs for the partitioned subgraphs and auxiliary bipartite graphs based on the subgraphs, and finally merge these MSTs to derive an MST of the original graph. The computational results indicate that when running on 150 CPUs, our algorithm can solve a cluster identification problem on a data set with 1,000,000 data points almost 100 times faster than on single CPU, indicating that this program is capable of handling very large data clustering problems in an efficient manner. We have implemented the clustering algorithm as the software CLUMP.",

        "abstract": "Residual dipolar coupling (RDC) represents one of the most exciting emerging NMR techniques for protein structure studies. However, solving a protein structure using RDC data alone is still a highly challenging problem. We report here a computer program, RDC-PROSPECT, for protein structure prediction based on a structural homolog or analog of the target protein in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which best aligns with the (15)N-(1)H RDC data of the protein recorded in a single ordering medium. Since RDC-PROSPECT uses only RDC data and predicted secondary structure information, its performance is virtually independent of sequence similarity between a target protein and its structural homolog/analog, making it applicable to protein targets beyond the scope of current protein threading techniques. We have tested RDC-PROSPECT on all (15)N-(1)H RDC data (representing 43 proteins) deposited in the BioMagResBank (BMRB) database. The program correctly identified structural folds for 83.7% of the target proteins, and achieved an average alignment accuracy of 98.1% residues within a four-residue shift.",

        "abstract": "A comparative analysis of genome-scale transcriptomic data of two types of skin cancers, melanoma and basal cell carcinoma in comparison with other cancer types, was conducted with the aim of identifying key regulatory factors that either cause or contribute to the aggressiveness of melanoma, while basal cell carcinoma generally remains a mild disease. Multiple cancer-related pathways such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell invasion and metastasis, are considered, but our focus is on energy metabolism, cell invasion and metastasis pathways. Our findings include the following. (a) Both types of skin cancers use both glycolysis and increased oxidative phosphorylation (electron transfer chain) for their energy supply. (b) Advanced melanoma shows substantial up-regulation of key genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (\u03b2-oxidation) and oxidative phosphorylation, with aerobic metabolism being far more efficient than anaerobic glycolysis, providing a source of the energetics necessary to support the rapid growth of this cancer. (c) While advanced melanoma is similar to pancreatic cancer in terms of the activity level of genes involved in promoting cell invasion and metastasis, the main metastatic form of basal cell carcinoma is substantially reduced in this activity, partially explaining why this cancer type has been considered as far less aggressive. Our method of using comparative analyses of transcriptomic data of multiple cancer types focused on specific pathways provides a novel and highly effective approach to cancer studies in general.",

Currently, the DOOR database contains operons for 675 prokaryotic genomes, and supports a number of search capabilities to facilitate easy access and utilization of the information stored in it. (1) Querying the database: the database provides a search capability for a user to find desired operons and associated information through multiple querying methods. (2) Searching for similar operons: the database provides a search capability for a user to find operons that have similar composition and structure to a query operon. (3) Prediction of cis-regulatory motifs: the database provides a capability for motif identification in the promoter regions of a user-specified group of possibly coregulated operons, using motif-finding tools. (4) Operons for RNA genes: the database includes operons for RNA genes. (5) OperonWiki: the database provides a wiki page (OperonWiki) to facilitate interactions between users and the developer of the database.

The method usually requires labor-intensive conjugation of nitroxide labels to multiple locations on the protein, one at a time. Here a computational procedure, based on protein sequence and simple secondary structure models, is presented to facilitate optimal placement of a minimum number of labels needed to determine the correct topology of a helical transmembrane protein. Tests on DsbB (four helices) using just one label lead to correct topology predictions in four of five cases, with the predicted structures <6 \u00c5 to the native structure. Benchmark results using simulated PRE data show that we can generally predict the correct topology for five and six to seven helices using two and three labels, respectively, with an average success rate of 76% and structures of similar precision. The results show promise in facilitating experimentally constrained structure prediction of membrane proteins.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Energy recently announced the first five grants for the Genomes to Life (GTL) Program. The goal of this program is to \"achieve the most far-reaching of all biological goals: a fundamental, comprehensive, and systematic understanding of life.\" While more information about the program can be found at the GTL website (www.doegenomestolife.org), this paper provides an overview of one of the five GTL projects funded, \"Carbon Sequestration in Synechococcus Sp.: From Molecular Machines to Hierarchical Modeling.\" This project is a combined experimental and computational effort emphasizing developing, prototyping, and applying new computational tools and methods to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of the carbon sequestration of Synechococcus Sp., an abundant marine cyanobacteria known to play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Understanding, predicting, and perhaps manipulating carbon fixation in the oceans has long been a major focus of biological oceanography and has more recently been of interest to a broader audience of scientists and policy makers. It is clear that the oceanic sinks and sources of CO(2) are important terms in the global environmental response to anthropogenic atmospheric inputs of CO(2) and that oceanic microorganisms play a key role in this response. However, the relationship between this global phenomenon and the biochemical mechanisms of carbon fixation in these microorganisms is poorly understood. The project includes five subprojects: an experimental investigation, three computational biology efforts, and a fifth which deals with addressing computational infrastructure challenges of relevance to this project and the Genomes to Life program as a whole. Our experimental effort is designed to provide biology and data to drive the computational efforts and includes significant investment in developing new experimental methods for uncovering protein partners, characterizing protein complexes, identifying new binding domains. We will also develop and apply new data measurement and statistical methods for analyzing microarray experiments. Our computational efforts include coupling molecular simulation methods with knowledge discovery from diverse biological data sets for high-throughput discovery and characterization of protein-protein complexes and developing a set of novel capabilities for inference of regulatory pathways in microbial genomes across multiple sources of information through the integration of computational and experimental technologies. These capabilities will be applied to Synechococcus regulatory pathways to characterize their interaction map and identify component proteins in these pathways. We will also investigate methods for combining experimental and computational results with visualization and natural language tools to accelerate discovery of regulatory pathways. Furthermore, given that the ultimate goal of this effort is to develop a systems-level of understanding of how the Synechococcus genome affects carbon fixation at the global scale, we will develop and apply a set of tools for capturing the carbon fixation behavior of complex of Synechococcus at different levels of resolution. Finally, because the explosion of data being produced by high-throughput experiments requires data analysis and models which are more computationally complex, more heterogeneous, and require coupling to ever increasing amounts of experimentally obtained data in varying formats, we have also established a companion computational infrastructure to support this effort as well as the Genomes to Life program as a whole.",

The method is inspired by the observation that homologous genes are highly likely to be orthologous if their neighboring genes are also homologous. Based on co-occurrences of homologous genes, we have grouped the (predicted) operons of 77 selected sequenced microbial genomes so that operons of the same group are highly likely to be functionally similar or related. We then cluster the homologous genes in the same operon group so that genes of the same cluster are highly likely to be similar in terms of their sequences and functions, i.e., they are predicted to be orthologous genes. By comparing our predicted orthologous gene groups with the COG assignments and NCBI annotations, we conclude that our method is promising to provide more accurate and specific predictions than the existing methods.",

Although a number of methods have been developed for comparing RNA structural similarities, their applications have been limited by the complexity of the required computation. In this paper, we present a novel method for comparing the similarity of RNA secondary structures generated from the same RNA sequence, i.e., a secondary structure ensemble, using a matrix representation of the RNA structures. Relevant features of the RNA secondary structures can be easily extracted through singular value decomposition (SVD) of the representing matrices. We have mapped the feature vectors of the singular values to a kernel space, where (dis)similarities among the mapped feature vectors become more evident, making clustering of RNA secondary structures easier to handle. The pair-wise comparison of RNA structures is achieved through computing the distance between the singular value vectors in the kernel space. We have applied a fuzzy kernel clustering method, using this similarity metric, to cluster the RNA secondary structure ensembles. Our application results suggest that our fuzzy kernel clustering method is highly promising for classifications of RNA structure ensembles, because of its low computational complexity and high clustering accuracy.",

The algorithm maps genes in a known pathway to their homologous genes (if any) in a target genome that is most consistent with (a) predicted orthologous gene relationship, (b) predicted operon structures, and (c) predicted co-regulation relationship of operons. Mathematically, we have formulated this problem as a constrained minimum spanning tree problem (called a Steiner network problem), and demonstrated that this formulation has the desired property through applications. We have solved this mapping problem using a combinatorial optimization algorithm, with guaranteed global optimality. We have implemented this algorithm as a computer program, called PMAP. Our test results on pathway mapping are highly encouraging -- we have mapped a number of pathways of H. influenzae, B. subtilis, H. pylori, and M. tuberculosis to E. coli using P-MAP, whose homologous pathways in E coli. are known and hence the mapping accuracy could be checked. We have then mapped known E. coli pathways in the EcoCyc database to the newly sequenced organism Synechococcus sp WH8102, and predicted 158 Synechococcus pathways. Detailed analyses on the predicted pathways indicate that P-MAP's mapping results are consistent with our general knowledge about (local) pathways. We believe that P-MAP will be a useful tool for microbial genome annotation projects and inference of individual microbial pathways.",

        "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins play essential roles in governing the functions and dynamics of proteins and are implicated in many cellular processes. Several types of PTMs have been investigated through computational approaches, including phosphorylation, sumoylation, palmitoylation, and lysine and arginine methylation, among others. Because the large diversity in the user interfaces (UIs) of different prediction servers for PTMs could possibly hinder experimental biologists in using these servers, we propose to develop a protocol for a unified UI for PTM prediction servers, based on our own work and that of other groups on PTM site prediction. By following this protocol, tool developers can provide a uniform UI regardless of the PTM types and the underlying computational algorithms. With such uniformity in the UI, experimental biologists would be able to use any PTM prediction server compliant with this protocol once they had learned to use one of them. It takes a typical PTM prediction server compliant with this unified UI several minutes to calculate the prediction results for a protein 1,000 amino acids in length.",

Homologous genes for both C-P lyase and phosphonatase degradative pathways are distributed in distantly related bacterial species. The phn gene clusters for the C-P lyase pathway show great structural and compositional variation among organisms, but all contain phnG-phnM genes that are essential for C-P bond cleavage. In the gamma-proteobacterium Erwinia carotovora, genes common to phosphonate biosyntheses were found in neighboring positions of those for the C-P lyase degradative pathway and in the same transcriptional direction. A gene encoding a hypothetical protein DUF1045 was found predominantly associated with the phn gene cluster and was predicted functionally related to C-P bond cleavage. Genes for phosphonate degradation are frequently located in close proximity of genes encoding transposases or other mobile elements. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that both degradative pathways have been subject to extensive lateral gene transfers during their evolution. The implications of plasmids and transposition in the evolution of phosphonate degradation are also discussed.",

Cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) catalyzes the first step of the phenylpropanoid pathway specifically dedicated to monolignol biosynthesis. However, plants contain multiple CCR-like genes, complicating the selection of lignin-specific targets. This study was undertaken to understand the complexity of the CCR gene family in tetraploid switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and to determine the biochemical properties of the encoded proteins. Four switchgrass cDNAs (most with multiple variants) encoding putative CCRs were identified by phylogenetic analysis, heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and the corresponding enzymes were characterized biochemically. Two cDNAs, PvCCR1 and PvCCR2, encoded enzymes with CCR activity. They are phylogenetically distinct, differentially expressed, and the corresponding enzymes exhibited different biochemical properties with regard to substrate preference. PvCCR1 has higher specific activity and prefers feruloyl CoA as substrate, whereas PvCCR2 prefers caffeoyl and 4-coumaroyl CoAs. Allelic variants of each cDNA were detected, but the two most diverse variants of PvCCR1 encoded enzymes with similar catalytic activity. Based on its properties and expression pattern, PvCCR1 is probably associated with lignin biosynthesis during plant development (and is therefore a target for the engineering of improved biomass), whereas PvCCR2 may function in defense.",

        "abstract": "Lateral gene transfer across boundaries of species brings new enzymes, pathways, and other novelties to host organisms and plays an important role in the evolution of life. Events of ancient gene transfer occurred during early evolutionary time. Considering the possibility that the novelties brought up by these ancient events are retained among descendent lineages and subsequently shape their genetic systems, ancient gene transfer theoretically plays a far greater role in evolution than those occurring to specific lineages or in more recent evolutionary time. We here report the lateral transfer of the gene encoding tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (tyrRS) from archaea to the ancestor of opisthokonts. Our sequence comparisons show that eukaryotic tyrRSs apparently fall into two major groups. The opisthokont tyrRS sequences are similar to their homologs from euryarchaeota. In particular, opisthokont tyrRSs share several indels with that of the archaeon Haloarcula marismortui. On the other hand, tyrRS sequences from the remaining eukaryotes, including parabasalid Trichomonas, diplomonad Giardia, amoebozoa, alveolates, kinetoplastids, green plants, and red algae, are similar to those of crenarchaeota and nanoarchaeota. The two groups of eukaryotic tyrRSs were further supported by phylogenetic evidence. The different origins of tyrRS lineages between opisthokonts and the remaining eukaryotes clearly indicate an ancient lateral gene transfer of tyrRS from an archaeon to the ancestor of opisthokonts. The fact that anciently transferred tyrRS unites the opisthokonts also points to the potential utility of ancient gene transfer events as molecular markers for major organismal lineages.",

Cellulosome components were observed only in bacterial genomes, and 166 cellulosome-dependent glycosyl hydrolases were identified. We observed, from our analysis data, unexpected wide distributions of two less well-studied bacterial glycosyl hydrolysis systems in which glycosyl hydrolases may bind to the cell surface directly rather than through linking to surface anchoring proteins, or cellulosome complexes may bind to the cell surface by novel mechanisms other than the other used SLH domains. In addition, we found that animal-gut metagenomes are substantially enriched with novel glycosyl hydrolases.The identified biomass degradation systems through our large-scale search are organized into an easy-to-use database GASdb at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~ffzhou/GASdb/, which should be useful to both experimental and computational biofuel researchers.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new framework for microarray gene-expression data clustering. The foundation of this framework is a minimum spanning tree (MST) representation of a set of multi-dimensional gene expression data. A key property of this representation is that each cluster of the expression data corresponds to one subtree of the MST, which rigorously converts a multi-dimensional clustering problem to a tree partitioning problem. We have demonstrated that though the inter-data relationship is greatly simplified in the MST representation, no essential information is lost for the purpose of clustering. Two key advantages in representing a set of multi-dimensional data as an MST are: (1) the simple structure of a tree facilitates efficient implementations of rigorous clustering algorithms, which otherwise are highly computationally challenging; and (2) as an MST-based clustering does not depend on detailed geometric shape of a cluster, it can overcome many of the problems faced by classical clustering algorithms. Based on the MST representation, we have developed a number of rigorous and efficient clustering algorithms, including two with guaranteed global optimality. We have implemented these algorithms as a computer software EXCAVATOR. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we have tested it on two data sets, i.e., expression data from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Arabidopsis expression data in response to chitin elicitation.",

However the most prevalent models in fold recognition methods treat every amino acid deletion and insertion as equally probable events. We have analyzed the alignment patterns for homologous and analogous sequences to determine patterns of insertion and deletions, and used that information to determine the statistics of insertions and deletions for different amino acids of a target sequence. We define these patterns as Insertion/Deletion (Indel) Frequency Arrays (IFA). By applying IFA to the protein threading problem, we have been able to improve the alignment accuracy, especially for proteins with low sequence identity.",

        "abstract": "Existing methods for orthologous gene mapping suffer from two general problems: (i) they are computationally too slow and their results are difficult to interpret for automated large-scale applications when based on phylogenetic analyses; or (ii) they are too prone to making mistakes in dealing with complex situations involving horizontal gene transfers and gene fusion due to the lack of a sound basis when based on sequence similarity information. We present a novel algorithm, Global Optimization Strategy (GOST), for orthologous gene mapping through combining sequence similarity and contextual (working partners) information, using a combinatorial optimization framework. Genome-scale applications of GOST show substantial improvements over the predictions by three popular sequence similarity-based orthology mapping programs. Our analysis indicates that our algorithm overcomes the intrinsic issues faced by sequence similarity-based methods, when orthology mapping involves gene fusions and horizontal gene transfers. Our program runs as efficiently as the most efficient sequence similarity-based algorithm in the public domain. GOST is freely downloadable at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~maqin/GOST.",

        "abstract": "We present a new algorithm, BOBRO, for prediction of cis-regulatory motifs in a given set of promoter sequences. The algorithm substantially improves the prediction accuracy and extends the scope of applicability of the existing programs based on two key new ideas: (i) we developed a highly effective method for reliably assessing the possibility for each position in a given promoter to be the (approximate) start of a conserved sequence motif; and (ii) we developed a highly reliable way for recognition of actual motifs from the accidental ones based on the concept of 'motif closure'. These two key ideas are embedded in a classical framework for motif finding through finding cliques in a graph but have made this framework substantially more sensitive as well as more selective in motif finding in a very noisy background. A comparative analysis shows that the performance coefficient was improved from 29% to 41% by our program compared to the best among other six state-of-the-art prediction tools on a large-scale data sets of promoters from one genome, and also consistently improved by substantial margins on another kind of large-scale data sets of orthologous promoters across multiple genomes. The power of BOBRO in dealing with noisy data was further demonstrated through identification of the motifs of the global transcriptional regulators by running it over 2390 promoter sequences of Escherichia coli K12.",

        "abstract": "High throughput protein identification in mass spectrometry is predominantly achieved by first identifying tryptic peptides using SEQUEST and then by combining the peptide hits for protein identification. Peptide identification is typically carried out by selecting SEQUEST hits above a specified threshold, the value of which is typically chosen empirically in an attempt to separate true identifications from the false ones. These SEQUEST scores are not normalized with respect to the composition, length and other parameters of the peptides. Furthermore, there is no rigorous reliability estimate assigned to the protein identifications derived from these scores. Hence the interpretation of SEQUEST hits generally requires human involvement, making it difficult to scale up the identification process for genome-scale applications. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a method, which combines a neural network and a statistical model, for \"normalizing\" SEQUEST scores, and also for providing a reliability estimate for each SEQUEST hit. This method improves the sensitivity and specificity of peptide identification compared to the standard filtering procedure used in the SEQUEST package, and provides a basis for estimating the reliability of protein identifications.",

For predictions at the residue level, the helix-helix and helix-membrane interactions were described by a set of knowledge-based energy functions. For predictions at the atom level, CHARMM19 force field was used. To facilitate the system to overcome energy barriers, the Wang-Landau method was employed, where a random walk is performed in the energy space with a uniform probability. Native-like structures were predicted at both levels for two model systems, each of which consists of two transmembrane helices. Interestingly, consistent results were obtained from simulations at the residue and atom levels for the same system, strongly suggesting the feasibility of a hierarchical approach for membrane protein structure predictions.",

The assignment process is tedious and time-consuming, and although many computer programs can assist the assignment process, several NMR labs still do the assignments manually or semimanually for quality reasons. The authors present a new computational framework for automating the assignment process, particularly for backbone resonance peak assignment. They formulate the assignment problem as a constrained weighted bipartite matching problem, which provides a natural framework for incorporating all available information into the assignment process. Although they can show that the constrained bipartite matching problem, in the most general situation, is NP-hard, they developed a rigorous algorithm for solving the problem. For practical data, the algorithm runs fast, taking advantage of the discerning power of their scoring scheme and ruling out a vast majority of bad individual assignments in a preprocessing step. They have implemented the algorithm and tested it on four proteins with both real and simulated NMR peaks. Their results show that when 75 percent of all the connectivities between NMR peaks are identified with simulated data, their assignment results will be close to or reach 100 percent accuracy. With the realistic connectivity information obtained from experimental peaks, their program can assign majority of the peaks correctly.",

Alternatively spliced variants play important roles in development and defects in mRNA splicing are causes of many human diseases [3, 4, 5]. Information about alternatively spliced variants is mainly derived from primary transcripts and little knowledge exists regarding structures. Here we carry out a structural genomics analysis of known alternative splicing events and show that threading is a valid approach to model structures of alternatively spliced variants. We collect 3-D structures of proteins with know translated splicing products from PDB and further expand the dataset with high quality models generated with threading approach. Our analysis shows that splicing events have a strong preference for non-regular secondary structure elements and tend to avoid buried residues. Those observations suggest evolutionary constrains exist for locations of splicing in the context of 3-D environment. We then show that majority of substitutions in splicing events share high structural similarity and splicing events also tend to remove entire domain and avoid exposing hydrophobic cores when part of a domain was removed. Those observations support the notion that majority of splicing isoforms adopt same fold as full-length protein despite sequence substitutions and deletions.",

        "abstract": "Alternative splicing is a sophisticated nuclear process that regulates gene expression. It represents an important mechanism for enhancing the functional diversity of proteins. Our current knowledge of alternatively spliced variants is derived mainly from mRNA transcripts, and very little is known about their protein tertiary structures. We carried out a large-scale analysis of known alternatively spliced variants at both protein sequence and structure levels and have shown that threading is, in general, a viable approach for modeling structures of alternatively spliced variants. An examination of alternative splicing at the protein sequence level revealed that the size of splicing events follows the power law distribution and the majority of splicing isoforms harbor only one or two alternations. We examined alternative splicing in the context of protein 3D structures and found that the boundaries of alternative splicing events generally happen in coil regions of secondary structures and exposed residues and the majority of the sequences involved in splicing are located on the surface of proteins. In light of these findings, we then proceeded to demonstrate that threading represents a useful tool for structure prediction of alternative splicing isoforms and addressed the fold stability issue of threading-based structure prediction by molecular dynamics simulation. Our analysis and the insights gained have helped to establish a viable method for structure prediction of alternatively spliced isoforms at the genome scale.",

Very little is known about the detailed response mechanism to osmotic stress in marine Synechococcus, one of the major oxygenic phototrophic cyanobacterial genera that contribute greatly to the global CO2 fixation.We present here a computational study of the osmoregulation network in response to hyperosmotic stress of Synechococcus sp strain WH8102 using comparative genome analyses and computational prediction. In this study, we identified the key transporters, synthetases, signal sensor proteins and transcriptional regulator proteins, and found experimentally that of these proteins, 15 genes showed significantly changed expression levels under a mild hyperosmotic stress.From the predicted network model, we have made a number of interesting observations about WH8102. Specifically, we found that (i) the organism likely uses glycine betaine as the major osmolyte, and others such as glucosylglycerol, glucosylglycerate, trehalose, sucrose and arginine as the minor osmolytes, making it efficient and adaptable to its changing environment; and (ii) sigma38, one of the seven types of sigma factors, probably serves as a global regulator coordinating the osmoregulation network and the other relevant networks.",

In this work, we have also developed a formal measure to quantify the degree of consistency between the predicted and the known modules, and have carried out statistical significance analysis of consistency measures. We first evaluate the functional relationship between two genes from three different perspectives--phylogenetic profile analysis, gene neighborhood analysis and Gene Ontology assignments. We then combine the three different sources of information in the framework of Bayesian inference, and we use the combined information to measure the strength of gene functional relationship. Finally, we apply a threshold-based method to predict functional modules. By applying this method to Escherichia coli K12, we have predicted 185 functional modules. Our predictions are highly consistent with the previously known functional modules in E.coli. The application results have demonstrated that our approach is highly promising for the prediction of functional modules encoded in a microbial genome.",

        "abstract": "Computational identification of blood-secretory proteins, especially proteins with differentially expressed genes in diseased tissues, can provide highly useful information in linking transcriptomic data to proteomic studies for targeted disease biomarker discovery in serum.A new algorithm for prediction of blood-secretory proteins is presented using an information-retrieval technique, called manifold ranking. On a dataset containing 305 known blood-secretory human proteins and a large number of other proteins that are either not blood-secretory or unknown, the new method performs better than the previous published method, measured in terms of the area under the recall-precision curve (AUC). A key advantage of the presented method is that it does not explicitly require a negative training set, which could often be noisy or difficult to derive for most biological problems, hence making our method more applicable than classification-based data mining methods in general biological studies.We believe that our program will prove to be very useful to biomedical researchers who are interested in finding serum markers, especially when they have candidate proteins derived through transcriptomic or proteomic analyses of diseased tissues. A computer program is developed for prediction of blood-secretory proteins based on manifold ranking, which is accessible at our website http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/publications/materials/qiliu/blood_secretory_protein.html.",

An application of the pipeline to 124 well-characterized human oncogenes has led to the identification of a collection of domains and domain pairs that occur substantially more frequently in oncogenes than in human genes on average. Most of these enriched domains and domain pairs are related to tyrosine kinase activities. In addition, our analyses indicate that a substantial portion of the domain-fusion events of oncogenes took place in metazoans during evolution.We expect that the computational pipeline for domain identification, domain origin and domain fusion prediction will prove to be useful for studying other groups of genes.",

        "abstract": "RNA interference via exogenous short interference RNAs (siRNA) is increasingly more widely employed as a tool in gene function studies, drug target discovery and disease treatment. Currently there is a strong need for rational siRNA design to achieve more reliable and specific gene silencing; and to keep up with the increasing needs for a wider range of applications. While progress has been made in the ability to design siRNAs with specific targets, we are clearly at an infancy stage towards achieving rational design of siRNAs with high efficacy. Among the many obstacles to overcome, lack of general understanding of what sequence features of siRNAs may affect their silencing efficacy and of large-scale homogeneous data needed to carry out such association analyses represents two challenges. To address these issues, we investigated a feature-selection based in-silico siRNA design from a novel cross-platform data integration perspective. An integration analysis of 4,482 siRNAs from ten meta-datasets was conducted for ranking siRNA features, according to their possible importance to the silencing efficacy of siRNAs across heterogeneous data sources. Our ranking analysis revealed for the first time the most relevant features based on cross-platform experiments, which compares favorably with the traditional in-silico siRNA feature screening based on the small samples of individual platform data. We believe that our feature ranking analysis can offer more creditable suggestions to help improving the design of siRNA with specific silencing targets.

        "abstract": "We present in this paper our hierarchical classification of genes for prokaryotic genomes from a methodological point of view. Our classification scheme is unique in that (1) the functional equivalence relationships among genes are assessed by using both sequence similarity and genomic context information, (2) genes are grouped into clusters of multiple resolution levels based on their equivalence relationships among each other, and (3) gene clusters, which are either parallel-to or inside-of one another, naturally form a hierarchical structure. This classification scheme has been applied for the genes of 224 complete prokaryotic genomes (release as of March, 2005). The classification results are available at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/HCG, and are validated through comparisons with the taxonomy of these 224 genomes, and with two existing gene classification schemes, Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) and Pfam, respectively.",

        "abstract": "We study a constrained bipartite matching problem where the input is a weighted bipartite graph G = (U, V,E), U is a set of vertices following a sequential order, V is another set of vertices partitioned into a collection of disjoint subsets, each following a sequential order, and E is a set of edges between U and V with non-negative weights. The objective is to find a matching in G with the maximum weight that satisfies the given sequential orders on both U and V , i.e., if ui+1 follows ui in U and if vj+1 follows vj in V, then ui is matched with vj if and only if ui+1 is matched with vj+1. The problem has recently been formulated as a crucial step in an algorithmic approach for interpreting NMR spectral data [15]. The interpretation of NMR spectral data is known as a key problem in protein structure determination via NMR spectroscopy. Unfortunately, the constrained bipartite matching problem is NP-hard [15]. We first propose a 2-approximation algorithm for the problem, which follows directly from the recent result of Bar-Noy et al. [2] on interval scheduling. However, our extensive experimental results on real NMR spectral data illustrate that the algorithm performs poorly in terms of recovering the target-matching (i.e. correct) edges. We then propose another approximation algorithm that tries to take advantage of the \"density\" of the sequential order information in V. Although we are only able to prove an approximation ratio of 3 log2 D for this algorithm, where D is the length of a longest string in V, the experimental results demonstrate that this new algorithm performs much better on real data, i.e. it is able to recover a large fraction of the target-matching edges and the weight of its output matching is often in fact close to the maximum. We also prove that the problem is MAX SNP-hard, even if the input bipartite graph is unweighted. We further present an approximation algorithm for a nontrivial special case that breaks the ratio 2 barrier.",

Measures can possibly be taken to prevent such problems from happening through preparing special diet and making special precautions prior or during the sailing if a detailed understanding can be gained about what specific health effects such voyages may have on the seamen.We present a computational study on 200 seamen using 41 chemistry indicators measured on their blood samples collected before and after the sailing. Our computational study is done using a data classification approach with a support vector machine-based classifier in conjunction with feature selections using a recursive feature elimination procedure.Our analysis results suggest that among the 41 blood chemistry measures, nine are most likely to be affected during the sailing, which provide important clues about the specific effects of ocean voyage on seamen's health.The identification of the nine blood chemistry measures provides important clues about the effects of long-distance voyage on seamen's health. These findings will prove to be useful to guide in improving the living and working environment, as well as food preparation on ships.",

Most, if not all, sequenced metagenomes are complex mixtures of chromosomal and plasmid sequence fragments from multiple organisms, possibly from different kingdoms. Computational methods for prediction of genomic elements such as genes are significantly different for chromosomes and plasmids, hence raising the need for separation of chromosomal from plasmid sequences in a metagenome. We present a program for classification of a metagenome set into chromosomal and plasmid sequences, based on their distinguishing pentamer frequencies. On a large training set consisting of all the sequenced prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids, the program achieves approximately 92% in classification accuracy. On a large set of simulated metagenomes with sequence lengths ranging from 300 bp to 100 kbp, the program has classification accuracy from 64.45% to 88.75%. On a large independent test set, the program achieves 88.29% classification accuracy.The program has been implemented as a standalone prediction program, cBar, which is available at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~ffzhou/cBar.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorus is an essential element for all life forms. However, it is limiting in most ecological environments where cyanobacteria inhabit. Elucidation of the phosphorus assimilation pathways in cyanobacteria will further our understanding of the physiology and ecology of this important group of microorganisms. However, a systematic study of the Pho regulon, the core of the phosphorus assimilation pathway in a cyanobacterium, is hitherto lacking.We have predicted and analyzed the Pho regulons in 19 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes using a highly effective scanning algorithm that we have previously developed. Our results show that different cyanobacterial species/ecotypes may encode diverse sets of genes responsible for the utilization of various sources of phosphorus, ranging from inorganic phosphate, phosphodiester, to phosphonates. Unlike in E. coli, some cyanobacterial genes that are directly involved in phosphorus assimilation seem to not be under the regulation of the regulator SphR (orthologue of PhoB in E coli.) in some species/ecotypes. On the other hand, SphR binding sites are found for genes known to play important roles in other biological processes. These genes might serve as bridging points to coordinate the phosphorus assimilation and other biological processes. More interestingly, in three cyanobacterial genomes where no sphR gene is encoded, our results show that there is virtually no functional SphR binding site, suggesting that transcription regulators probably play an important role in retaining their binding sites.The Pho regulons in cyanobacteria are highly diversified to accommodate to their respective living environments. The phosphorus assimilation pathways in cyanobacteria are probably tightly coupled to a number of other important biological processes. The loss of a regulator may lead to the rapid loss of its binding sites in a genome.",

        "abstract": "Recognition of protein-binding sites from the upstream regions of genes is a highly important and unsolved problem. In this paper, we present a new approach for studying this challenging issue. We formulate the binding-site recognition problem as a cluster identification problem, i.e., to identify clusters in a data set that exhibit significantly different features (e.g., density) than the overall background of the data set. We have developed a general framework for solving such a cluster identification problem. The foundation of the framework is a rigorous relationship between data clusters and subtrees of a minimum spanning tree (MST) representation of a data set. We have proposed a formal and general definition of clusters, and have demonstrated that a cluster is always represented as a connected component of the MST, and further it corresponds to a substring of a linear representation of the MST. Hence a cluster identification problem is reduced to a problem of finding substrings with certain features, for which algorithms have been developed. We have applied this MST-based cluster identification algorithm to a number of binding site identification problems. The results are highly encouraging.",

WH8102 genome based on three types of genomic data: intergenic distances, COG gene functions and phylogenetic profiles. In the proposed method, we first estimate a log-likelihood distribution for each type of genomic data, and then fuse these distribution information by a perceptron to discriminate pairs of genes within operons (WO pairs) from those across transcription unit borders (TUB pairs). Computational experiments demonstrated that WO pairs tend to have shorter intergenic distances, a higher probability being in the same COG functional categories and more similar phylogenetic profiles than TUB pairs, indicating their powerful capabilities for operon prediction. By testing the method on 236 known operons of Escherichia coli K12, an overall accuracy of 83.8% is obtained by joint learning from multiple types of genomic data, whereas individual information source yields accuracies of 80.4%, 74.4%, and 70.6% respectively. We have applied this new approach, in conjunction with our previous comparative genome analysis-based approach, to predict 556 (putative) operons in WH8102.

We have examined all human GPCR genes with at least two functional protein isoforms, totaling 199, aiming to gain an understanding of what may have contributed to the large diversity of the exon-intron structures of the GPCR genes. The 199 genes have a total of 808 known protein splicing isoforms with experimentally verified functions. Our analysis reveals that 1301 (80.6%) adjacent exon-exon pairs out of the total of 1,613 in the 199 genes have either exactly one exon skipped or the intron in-between retained in at least one of the 808 protein splicing isoforms. This observation has a statistical significance p-value of 2.051762 * e(-09), assuming that the observed splicing isoforms are independent of the exon-intron structures. Our interpretation of this observation is that the exon boundaries of the GPCR genes are not randomly determined; instead they may be selected to facilitate specific alternative splicing for functional purposes.",

        "abstract": "Mass spectrometry is one of the most popular analytical techniques for identification of individual proteins in a protein mixture, one of the basic problems in proteomics. It identifies a protein through identifying its unique mass spectral pattern. While the problem is theoretically solvable, it remains a challenging problem computationally. One of the key challenges comes from the difficulty in distinguishing the N- and C-terminus ions, mostly b- and y-ions respectively. In this paper, we present a graph algorithm for solving the problem of separating b- from y-ions in a set of mass spectra. We represent each spectral peak as a node and consider two types of edges: a type-1 edge connects two peaks possibly of the same ion types and a type-2 edge connects two peaks possibly of different ion types, predicted based on local information. The ion-separation problem is then formulated and solved as a graph partition problem, which is to partition the graph into three subgraphs, namely b-, y-ions and others respectively, so to maximize the total weight of type-1 edges while minimizing the total weight of type-2 edges within each subgraph. We have developed a dynamic programming algorithm for rigorously solving this graph partition problem and implemented it as a computer program PRIME. We have tested PRIME on 18 data sets of high accurate FT-ICR tandem mass spectra and found that it achieved ~90% accuracy for separation of b- and y- ions.",

        "abstract": "Motivation: Bi-clustering extends the traditional clustering techniques by attempting to find (all) subgroups of genes with similar expression patterns under to-be-identified subsets of experimental conditions when applied to gene expression data. The bi-clustering strategy has been widely used for analyses of gene expression data and beyond since it was first proposed in 2000 since it provides much increased flexibility and analysis power in identifying co-expressed genes under some but not necessarily all conditions, compared to traditional clustering methods. Still the real power of this clustering strategy is yet to be fully realized due to the lack of effective and efficient algorithms for reliably solving the bi-clustering problem. Results: We present a novel method to solve a bi-clustering problem, using a (traditional) clustering algorithm combined with a combinatorial technique. The algorithm achieves the same asymptotic computational complexity of the underlying clustering algorithm. While it is a heuristic algorithm in nature, the algorithm achieves close-to optimum classification results across a large collection of benchmark sets.",

        "abstract": "Systematic dissection of the sumoylation proteome is emerging as an appealing but challenging research topic because of the significant roles sumoylation plays in cellular dynamics and plasticity. Although several proteome-scale analyzes have been performed to delineate potential sumoylatable proteins, the bona fide sumoylation sites still remain to be identified. Previously, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of the SUMO substrates in human nucleus using the putative motif psi-K-X-E and evolutionary conservation. However, a highly specific predictor for in silico prediction of sumoylation sites in any individual organism is still urgently needed to guide experimental design. In this work, we present a computational system SUMOsp--SUMOylation Sites Prediction, based on a manually curated dataset, integrating the results of two methods, GPS and MotifX, which were originally designed for phosphorylation site prediction. SUMOsp offers at least as good prediction performance as the only available method, SUMOplot, on a very large test set. We expect that the prediction results of SUMOsp combined with experimental verifications will propel our understanding of sumoylation mechanisms to a new level. SUMOsp has been implemented on a freely accessible web server at: http://bioinformatics.lcd-ustc.org/sumosp/.",

        "abstract": "In bacterium, genes working in the same pathway or interacting with each other are often organized into operons. Currently, the prediction accuracy for operon/boundary gene pairs is fairly good in Escherichia coli, however, such a high level of success in recognizing a gene pair as a boundary or operon pair does not automatically transcribe into a high level of accuracy in predicting the boundary of operons. We found that for several operon prediction programs, the prediction accuracy is often less accurate when the intergenic region of a gene pair is between 40 to 250 base pairs. In our approach, multiple features of the intergenic region, gene length and available microarray data in E. coli were used to improve the accuracy of the operon prediction programs in general and of gene pairs in the above intergenic region in particular. These features were scored according to a log likelihood formula, and the result suggests that we can gain up to 8% increase in the accuracy level for gene pairs with the intergenic distance between 40-250 base pairs. For other regions, the newly added features also give a moderate improvement in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the accuracy in predicting transcript boundary is also improved, comparing to methods using the intergenic distance and functional annotation alone. We are currently fine-tuning our program to predict all operons in E. coli, and applying this method to predict operons in other organisms.",

        "abstract": "Reconstruction of biological pathways is typically done through mapping well-characterized pathways of model organisms to a target genome, through orthologous gene mapping. A limitation of such pathway-mapping approaches is that the mapped pathway models are constrained by the composition of the template pathways, e.g., some genes in a target pathway may not have corresponding genes in the template pathways, the so-called \"missing gene\" problem.We present a novel pathway-expansion method for identifying additional genes that are possibly involved in a target pathway after pathway mapping, to fill holes caused by missing genes as well as to expand the mapped pathway model. The basic idea of the algorithm is to identify genes in the target genome whose homologous genes share common operons with homologs of any mapped pathway genes in some reference genome, and to add such genes to the target pathway if their functions are consistent with the cellular function of the target pathway.We have implemented this idea using a graph-theoretic approach and demonstrated the effectiveness of the algorithm on known pathways of E. coli in the KEGG database. On all KEGG pathways containing at least 5 genes, our method achieves an average of 60% positive predictive value (PPV) and the performance is increased with more seed genes added. Analysis shows that our method is highly robust.An effective method is presented to find missing genes in biological pathways of prokaryotes, which achieves high prediction reliability on E. coli at a genome level. Numerous missing genes are found to be related to known E. coli pathways, which can be further validated through biological experiments. Overall this method is robust and can be used for functional inference.",

        "abstract": "Identification of operons at the genome scale of prokaryotic organisms represents a key step in deciphering of their transcriptional regulation machinery, biological pathways, and networks. While numerous computational methods have been shown to be effective in predicting operons for well-studied organisms such as Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis 168, these methods generally do not generalize well to genomes other than the ones used to train the methods, or closely related genomes because they rely on organism-specific information. Several methods have been explored to address this problem through utilizing only genomic structural information conserved across multiple organisms, but they all suffer from the issue of low prediction sensitivity. In this paper, we report a novel operon prediction method that is applicable to any prokaryotic genome with high prediction accuracy. The key idea of the method is to predict operons through identification of conserved gene clusters across multiple genomes and through deriving a key parameter relevant to the distribution of intergenic distances in genomes. We have implemented this method using a graph-theoretic approach, to calculate a set of maximum gene clusters in the target genome that are conserved across multiple reference genomes. Our computational results have shown that this method has higher prediction sensitivity as well as specificity than most of the published methods. We have carried out a preliminary study on operons unique to archaea and bacteria, respectively, and derived a number of interesting new insights about operons between these two kingdoms.

The helices were modeled with a united atom representation, and the CHARMM19 force field was employed. Based on known experimental structures of membrane proteins, an implicit knowledge-based potential was developed to describe the helix-membrane interactions at the residue level, whose validity was tested through prediction of the orientations when single helices were inserted into a membrane. Two systems were studied in this article, namely the glycophorin A dimer, and helices A and B of Bacteriorhodopsin. For the glycophorin A dimer, the most stable structure (0.5 A away from the experimental structure) is mainly stabilized by the favorable helix-helix interactions, and has the most population regardless of the helix-membrane interaction. However, for helices A and B of Bacteriorhodopsin, it was found that the packing determined by helix-helix interactions is nonspecific, and a native-like structure (0.2 A from the experimental one) can be identified from several structural analogs as the most stable one only after applying the membrane potential. Our results suggest that the contribution from the helix-membrane interaction could be critical in the correct packing of transmembrane helices in the membrane.",

We have predicted operons in P.furiosus by combining the results from three existing algorithms using a neural network (NN). These algorithms use intergenic distances, phylogenetic profiles, functional categories and gene-order conservation in their operon prediction. Our method takes as inputs the confidence scores of the three programs, and outputs a prediction of whether adjacent genes on the same strand belong to the same operon. In addition, we have applied Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway information to improve the accuracy of our algorithm. The parameters of this NN predictor are trained on a subset of all experimentally verified operon gene pairs of Bacillus subtilis. It subsequently achieved 86.5% prediction accuracy when applied to a subset of gene pairs for Escherichia coli, which is substantially better than any of the three prediction programs. Using this new algorithm, we predicted 470 operons in the P.furiosus genome. Of these, 349 were validated using DNA microarray data.",

We have developed a prediction pipeline, PROSPECT-PSPP, an integration of multiple computational tools, for fully automated protein structure prediction. The pipeline consists of tools for (i) preprocessing of protein sequences, which includes signal peptide prediction, protein type prediction (membrane or soluble) and protein domain partition, (ii) secondary structure prediction, (iii) fold recognition and (iv) atomic structural model generation. The centerpiece of the pipeline is our threading-based program PROSPECT. The pipeline is implemented using SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which makes it easier to share our tools and resources. The pipeline has an easy-to-use user interface and is implemented on a 64-node dual processor Linux cluster. It can be used for genome-scale protein structure prediction.

        "abstract": "We present a computational method for prediction of functional modules that can be directly applied to the newly sequenced microbial genomes for predicting gene functions and the component genes of biological pathways. We first quantify the functional relatedness among genes based on their distribution (i.e., their existences and orders) across multiple microbial genomes, and obtain a gene network in which every pair of genes is associated with a score representing their functional relatedness. We then apply a threshold-based clustering algorithm to this gene network, and obtain modules for each of which the number of genes is bounded from above by a pre-specified value and the component genes are more strongly functionally related to each other than genes across the predicted modules. Particularly, when the module size is bounded by 130, we obtain 167 functional modules covering 813 genes for Escherichia coli K12, and 138 functional modules covering 731 genes for Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168. We have used the gene ontology (GO) information to assess the prediction results. The GO similarities among the genes of the same functional module are compared with the GO similarities among the genes that are randomly clustered together. This comparison reveals that our predicted functional modules are statistically and biologically significant, and the genes of the same functional module share more commonality in terms of biological process than in terms of molecular function or cellular component. We have also examined the predicted functional modules that are common to both Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168, and provide explanations for some functional modules.",

        "abstract": "Deciphering the regulatory networks encoded in the genome of an organism represents one of the most interesting and challenging tasks in the post- genome sequencing era. As an example of this problem, we have predicted a detailed model for the nitrogen assimilation network in cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. WH 8102 (WH8102) using a com- putational protocol based on comparative genomics analysis and mining experimental data from related organisms that are relatively well studied. This computational model is in excellent agreement with the microarray gene expression data collected under ammonium-rich versus nitrate-rich growth conditions, suggesting that our computational protocol is capable of predicting biological path- ways/networks with high accuracy. We then refined the computational model using the microarray data, and proposed a new model for the nitrogen assimilation network in WH8102. An intriguing discovery from this study is that nitrogen assimil- ation affects the expression of many genes involved in photosynthesis, suggesting a tight coordination between nitrogen assimilation and photosynthesis processes. Moreover, for some of these genes, this coordination is probably mediated by NtcA through the canonical NtcA promoters in their regulatory regions.",

The Csl families have been proposed to be involved in the synthesis of the backbones of hemicelluloses of plant cell walls. With 17 plant and algal genomes fully sequenced, we sought to conduct a genome-wide and systematic investigation of this superfamily through in-depth phylogenetic analyses.A single-copy gene is found in the six chlorophyte green algae, which is most closely related to the CslA and CslC families that are present in the seven land plants investigated in our analyses. Six proteins from poplar, grape and sorghum form a distinct family (CslJ), providing further support for the conclusions from two recent studies. CslB/E/G/H/J families have evolved significantly more rapidly than their widely distributed relatives, and tend to have intragenomic duplications, in particular in the grape genome.Our data suggest that the CslA and CslC families originated through an ancient gene duplication event in land plants. We speculate that the single-copy Csl gene in green algae may encode a mannan synthase. We confirm that the rest of the Csl families have a different evolutionary origin than CslA and CslC, and have proposed a model for the divergence order among them. Our study provides new insights about the evolution of this important gene family in plants.",

        "abstract": "Biclustering extends the traditional clustering techniques by attempting to find (all) subgroups of genes with similar expression patterns under to-be-identified subsets of experimental conditions when applied to gene expression data. Still the real power of this clustering strategy is yet to be fully realized due to the lack of effective and efficient algorithms for reliably solving the general biclustering problem. We report a QUalitative BIClustering algorithm (QUBIC) that can solve the biclustering problem in a more general form, compared to existing algorithms, through employing a combination of qualitative (or semi-quantitative) measures of gene expression data and a combinatorial optimization technique. One key unique feature of the QUBIC algorithm is that it can identify all statistically significant biclusters including biclusters with the so-called 'scaling patterns', a problem considered to be rather challenging; another key unique feature is that the algorithm solves such general biclustering problems very efficiently, capable of solving biclustering problems with tens of thousands of genes under up to thousands of conditions in a few minutes of the CPU time on a desktop computer. We have demonstrated a considerably improved biclustering performance by our algorithm compared to the existing algorithms on various benchmark sets and data sets of our own. QUBIC was written in ANSI C and tested using GCC (version 4.1.2) on Linux. Its source code is available at: http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/ approximately maqin/bicluster.

Currently, the majority of the cell-wall synthesis-related (CWSR) proteins are unknown even for model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We report a computational framework for predicting CWSR proteins based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and known CWSR proteins. We predict a protein to be a CWSR protein if it interacts with known CWSR proteins (seeds) with high statistical significance. Using this technique, we predicted 100 candidate CWSR proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana, 8 of which were experimentally confirmed by previous reports. Forty-two candidates have either independent supporting evidence or strong functional relevance to cell-wall synthesis and, hence, are considered as the most reliable predictions. For 33 of the predicted CWSR proteins, we have predicted their detailed functional roles in CWS, based on analyses of their domain architectures, phylogeny, and current functional annotation in conjunction with a literature search. We present the constructed PPIs covering all the known and predicted CWSR proteins at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/\u223czhouchan/CellWallProtein/. The 42 most reliable candidates provide useful targets to experimentalists for further investigation, and the PPI data constructed in this work provides new information for cell-wall research.",

The test results show that our new approach's performance is comparable to or better than the other blind search methods, but is more efficient computationally and simpler in its concept.",

To fully utilize the analysis power the algorithm provides, we have developed a web server, QServer, for prediction, computational validation and analyses of co-expressed gene clusters. Specifically, the QServer has the following capabilities in addition to biclustering by QUBIC: (i) prediction and assessment of conserved cis regulatory motifs in promoter sequences of the predicted co-expressed genes; (ii) functional enrichment analyses of the predicted co-expressed gene clusters using Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and (iii) visualization capabilities in support of interactive biclustering analyses. QServer supports the biclustering and functional analysis for a wide range of organisms, including human, mouse, Arabidopsis, bacteria and archaea, whose underlying genome database will be continuously updated.We believe that QServer provides an easy-to-use and highly effective platform useful for hypothesis formulation and testing related to transcription co-regulation.",

However, the most prevalent models in fold recognition methods treat every amino acid deletion and insertion as equally probable events. We have analyzed the alignment patterns for homologous and analogous sequences to determine patterns of insertion and deletion, and used that information to determine the statistics of insertions and deletions for different amino acids of a target sequence. We define these patterns as insertion/deletion (indel) frequency arrays (IFAs). By applying IFAs to the protein threading problem, we have been able to improve the alignment accuracy, especially for proteins with low sequence identity. We have also demonstrated that the application of this information can lead to an improvement in fold recognition.",

        "abstract": "Biological pathway mapping is an important problem in the post-genomic era. We now present a new algorithm for pathway mapping in microbes. The algorithm considers not only sequence similarity among the template and target genes, but also the operon structures in the target genome. We formulated the mapping problem as a graph finding problem, and solved it by an Integer-Programming (IP) method. The goal is to minimize a linear object function subject to six constraints, such that maximal sequence similarity among the template and target genes are achieved, and at the same time, a minimal number of operons are covered in the target genome. Compared to our previous Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, the IP method has the following advantages: i) It is much faster and thus can map larger pathway involving a much large set of genes. ii) The IP method looks into the details of genes in the operons, and consequently avoids the many-to-one mapping mistakes that sometimes occur in the MST algorithm. We have compiled a large pathway training set to optimize the parameters of the program, and tested it by mapping 16 complex pathways from BioCyc onto E.coli K12 genome and the results are very promising.",

Automatic decomposition of protein structures into structural domains, though after many years of investigation, remains a challenging and unsolved problem. Manual inspection still plays a key role in domain decomposition of a protein structure. We have previously developed a computer program, DomainParser, using network flow algorithms. The algorithm partitions a protein structure into domains accurately when the number of domains to be partitioned is known. However the performance drops when this number is unclear (the overall performance is 74.5% over a set of 1317 protein chains). Through utilization of various types of structural information including hydrophobic moment profile, we have developed an effective method for assessing the most probable number of domains a structure may have. The core of this method is a neural network, which is trained to discriminate correctly partitioned domains from incorrectly partitioned domains. When compared with the manual decomposition results given in the SCOP database, our new algorithm achieves higher decomposition accuracy (81.9%) on the same data set.",

We have compared the distributions and functions of Z-DNA in the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice, and observed that Z-DNA occurs in rice at least 9 times more often than in Arabidopsis; similar observations hold for other monocots and dicots. In addition, Z-DNA is significantly enriched in the coding regions of Arabidopsis, and in the high-GC-content regions of rice. Based on our analyses, we speculate that Z-DNA may play a role in regulating the expression of transcription factors, inhibitors, translation repressors, succinate dehydrogenases and glutathione-disulfide reductases in Arabidopsis, and it may affect the expression of vesicle and nucleosome genes and genes involved in alcohol transporter activity, stem cell maintenance, meristem development and reproductive structure development in rice.",

Instead of scoring candidate motifs individually like in all the existing motif-finding programs, our method scores groups of candidate motifs with similar sequences, called motif closures, using a P-value, which has substantially improved the prediction reliability over the existing methods. Our new P-value scoring scheme is sequence length independent, hence allowing direct comparisons among predicted motifs with different lengths on the same footing. We have implemented this method as a Motif Recognition Computer (MREC) program, and have extensively tested MREC on both simulated and biological data from prokaryotic genomes. Our test results indicate that MREC can accurately pick out the actual motif with the correct length as the best scoring candidate for the vast majority of the cases in our test set. We compared our prediction results with two motif-finding programs Cosmo and MEME, and found that MREC outperforms both programs across all the test cases by a large margin. The MREC program is available at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~bingqiang/MREC1/.",

The analysis results indicate that (a) each of the seven cancer types can be distinguished from its corresponding control tissue based on the expression patterns of a small number of genes, e.g., 2, 3 or 4; (b) the expression patterns of some genes can distinguish multiple cancer types from their corresponding control tissues, potentially serving as general markers for all or some groups of cancers; (c) the proteins encoded by some of these genes are predicted to be blood secretory, thus providing potential cancer markers in blood; (d) the numbers of differentially expressed genes across different cancer types in comparison with their control tissues correlate well with the five-year survival rates associated with the individual cancers; and (e) some metabolic and signaling pathways are abnormally activated or deactivated across all cancer types, while other pathways are more specific to certain cancers or groups of cancers. The novel findings of this study offer considerable insight into these seven cancer types and have the potential to provide exciting new directions for diagnostic and therapeutic development.",

However, this popular strategy may notbe directly applicable to prokaryotic genomes, where typically abouthalf of the genes in a genome form multiple-gene transcription unitsor operons. The promoter sequences for these operons are located in theinter-operonic rather than inter-genic regions, which require prediction ofTFBSs at the transcriptional unit instead of individual gene level. Wehave formulated as a bipartite graph matching problem the identificationof conserved operons (including both single-gene and multi-gene operons)whose individual gene members are orthologous between two genomesand present a graph-theoretic solution. By applying this method to Escherichiacoli K12 and 11 of its phylogeneticly neighboring species, wehave predicted 2, 478 sets of conserved operons, and discovered potentialbinding motifs for each of these operons. By comparing the predictionresults of our approach and other prediction approaches, we concludethat it is advantageous to use our approach for prediction of cis regulatorybinding sites in prokaryotes.

        "abstract": "Gene expression data clustering provides a powerful tool for studying functional relationships of genes in a biological process. Identifying correlated expression patterns of genes represents the basic challenge in this clustering problem.This paper describes a new framework for representing a set of multi-dimensional gene expression data as a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), a concept from the graph theory. A key property of this representation is that each cluster of the expression data corresponds to one subtree of the MST, which rigorously converts a multi-dimensional clustering problem to a tree partitioning problem. We have demonstrated that though the inter-data relationship is greatly simplified in the MST representation, no essential information is lost for the purpose of clustering. Two key advantages in representing a set of multi-dimensional data as an MST are: (1) the simple structure of a tree facilitates efficient implementations of rigorous clustering algorithms, which otherwise are highly computationally challenging; and (2) as an MST-based clustering does not depend on detailed geometric shape of a cluster, it can overcome many of the problems faced by classical clustering algorithms. Based on the MST representation, we have developed a number of rigorous and efficient clustering algorithms, including two with guaranteed global optimality. We have implemented these algorithms as a computer software EXpression data Clustering Analysis and VisualizATiOn Resource (EXCAVATOR). To demonstrate its effectiveness, we have tested it on three data sets, i.e. expression data from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression data in response of human fibroblasts to serum, and Arabidopsis expression data in response to chitin elicitation. The test results are highly encouraging.EXCAVATOR is available on request from the authors.",

        "abstract": "As the first step toward a multi-scale, hierarchical computational approach for membrane protein structure prediction, the packing of transmembrane helices was modeled at the residual and atomistic levels, respectively. For predictions at the residual level, the helix-helix and helix-lipid interactions were described by a set of knowledge-based energy functions. For predictions at the atomistic level, CHARMM19 force field was employed. To facilitate the system to overcome energy barriers, Wang-Landau sampling was carried out by performing a random walk in the energy and conformational spaces. Native-like structures were predicted at both levels for 2- and 7-helix systems. Interestingly, consistent results were obtained from simulations at residual and atomistic levels for the same system, strongly suggesting the feasibility of a hierarchical approach for membrane structure prediction.",

Here we report an analysis of two types of chameleon sequences, chameleon-HS (Helix vs. Strand) and chameleon-HE (Helix vs. Sheet), based on known structures in Protein Data Bank. Our survey shows that the longest chameleon-HS is eight residues while the longest chameleon-HE is seven residues. We have done a detailed analysis on the local and global environment that might contribute to the unique conformation of a chameleon sequence. We found that the existence of chameleon sequences does not present a problem for secondary structure prediction programs, including the first generation prediction programs, such as Chou-Fasman algorithm, and the third generation prediction programs that utilize evolution information. We have also investigated the possible implication of chameleon sequences in structural conservation and functional diversity of alternatively spliced protein isoforms.",

        "abstract": "The problem of sorting by reciprocal translocations (abbreviated as SBT) arises from the field of comparative genomics, which is to find a shortest sequence of reciprocal translocations that transforms one genome \\Pi into another genome \\Gamma, with the restriction that \\Pi and \\Gamma contain the same genes. SBT has been proved to be polynomial-time solvable, and several polynomial algorithms have been developed. In this paper, we show how to extend Bergeron's SBT algorithm to include insertions and deletions, allowing to compare genomes containing different genes. In particular, if the gene set of \\Pi is a subset (or superset, respectively) of the gene set of \\Gamma, we present an approximation algorithm for transforming \\Pi into \\Gamma by reciprocal translocations and deletions (insertions, respectively), providing a sorting sequence with length at most OPT + 2, where OPT is the minimum number of translocations and deletions (insertions, respectively) needed to transform \\Pi into \\Gamma; if \\Pi and \\Gamma have different genes but not containing each other, we give a heuristic to transform \\Pi into \\Gamma by a shortest sequence of reciprocal translocations, insertions, and deletions, with bounds for the length of the sorting sequence it outputs. At a conceptual level, there is some similarity between our algorithm and the algorithm developed by El Mabrouk which is used to sort two chromosomes with different gene contents by reversals, insertions, and deletions.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a new method for prediction of cis-regulatory binding sites and applied it to predicting NtcA regulated genes in cyanobacteria. The algorithm rigorously utilizes concurrence information of multiple binding sites in the upstream region of a gene and that in the upstream regions of its orthologues in related genomes. A probabilistic model was developed for the evaluation of prediction reliability so that the prediction false positive rate could be well controlled. Using this method, we have predicted multiple new members of the NtcA regulons in nine sequenced cyanobacterial genomes, and showed that the false positive rates of the predictions have been reduced on an average of 40-fold compared to the conventional methods. A detailed analysis of the predictions in each genome showed that a significant portion of our predictions are consistent with previously published results about individual genes. Intriguingly, NtcA promoters are found for many genes involved in various stages of photosynthesis. Although photosynthesis is known to be tightly coordinated with nitrogen assimilation, very little is known about the underlying mechanism. We postulate for the fist time that these genes serve as the regulatory points to orchestrate these two important processes in a cyanobacterial cell.",

Here we present a structural model for the core of amyloid fibrils formed by the Abeta peptide using computational approaches and experimental data. Abeta(15-36) was threaded against the parallel beta-helical proteins. Our multi-layer model was constructed using the top scoring template 1lxa, a left-handed parallel beta-helical protein. This six-rung helical model has in-register repeats of the Abeta(15-36) sequence. Each rung has three beta-strands separated by two turns. The model was tested using molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water, and is in good agreement with a number of experimental observations. In addition, a model based on right-handed helical proteins is also described. The core structural model described here might serve as the building block of the Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibril as well as some other amyloid fibrils.",

In 1996, Hannenhalli gave the formula of the translocation distance for the first time, based on which an O(n3) algorithm for SBT was given. In 2005, Anne Bergeron et al. revisited this problem and gave an elementary proof for the formula of the translocation distance which leads to a new O(n3) algorithm for SBT. In this paper, we show how to extend Anne Bergeron's algorithm for SBT to include deletions, which allows us to compare genomes containing different genes. We present an asymptotically optimal algorithm for transforming Pi to Gamma by translocations and deletions, providing a feasible sequence with length at most OPT+2, where OPT is the minimum number of translocations and deletions transforming Pi to Gamma. Furthermore, this analysis can be used to approximate the minimum number of translocations and insertions transforming one genome to another.",

Chunjie resembles the other known MITEs in many aspects, e.g., having TIR signals and direct repeats, small in size, noncoding, able to fold into a stable secondary structure, and typically inserted into A + T-rich regions. At least one case of recent transposition was observed, i.e., the insertion of Chunjie into one copy of the aforementioned operon.

Most, if not all, sequenced metagenomes are complex mixtures of chromosomal and plasmid sequence fragments from multiple organisms, possibly from different kingdoms. Computational methods for prediction of genomic elements such as genes are significantly different for chromosomes and plasmids, hence raising the need for separation of chromosomal from plasmid sequences in a metagenome. We present a program for classification of a metagenome set into chromosomal and plasmid sequences, based on their distinguishing pentamer frequencies. On a large training set consisting of all the sequenced prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids, the program achieves ~92% in classification accuracy. On a large set of simulated metagenomes with sequence lengths ranging from 300 bp to 100 kbp, the program has classification accuracy from 64.45% to 88.75%. On a large independent test set, the program achieves 88.29% classification accuracy.

        "abstract": "The grade of a cancer is a measure of the canceru0027s malignancy level, and the stage of a cancer refers to the size and the extent that the cancer has spread. Here we present a computational method for prediction of gene signatures and blood/urine protein markers for breast cancer grades and stages based on RNA-seq data, which are retrieved from the TCGA breast cancer dataset and cover 111 pairs of disease and matching adjacent noncancerous tissues with pathologists-assigned stages and grades. By applying a differential expression and an SVM-based classification approach, we found that 324 and 227 genes in cancer have their expression levels consistently up-regulated vs. their matching controls in a grade- and stage-dependent manner, respectively. By using these genes, we predicted a 9-gene panel as a gene signature for distinguishing poorly differentiated from moderately and well differentiated breast cancers, and a 19-gene panel as a gene signature for discriminating between the moderately and well differentiated breast cancers. Similarly, a 30-gene panel and a 21-gene panel are predicted as gene signatures for distinguishing advanced stage (stages III-IV) from early stage (stages I-II) cancer samples and for distinguishing stage II from stage I samples, respectively. We expect these gene panels can be used as gene-expression signatures for cancer grade and stage classification. In addition, of the 324 grade-dependent genes, 188 and 66 encode proteins that are predicted to be blood-secretory and urine-excretory, respectively; and of the 227 stage-dependent genes, 123 and 51 encode proteins predicted to be blood-secretory and urine-excretory, respectively. We anticipate that some combinations of these blood and urine proteins could serve as markers for monitoring breast cancer at specific grades and stages through blood and urine tests.",

        "abstract": "Global DNA hypomethylation occurs in many cancer types, but there is no explanation for its differential occurrence or possible impact on cancer cell physiology. Here we address these issues with a computational study of genome-scale DNA methylation in 16 cancer types. Specifically, we identified (i) a possible determinant for global DNA methylation in cancer cells and (ii) a relationship between levels of DNA methylation, nucleotide synthesis, and intracellular oxidative stress in cells. We developed a system of kinetic equations to capture the metabolic relations among DNA methylation, nucleotide synthesis, and antioxidative stress response, including their competitions for methyl and sulfur groups, based on known information about one-carbon metabolism and trans-sulfuration pathways. We observed a kinetic-based regulatory mechanism that controls reaction rates of the three competing processes when their shared resources are limited, particularly when the nucleotide synthesis rates or oxidative states are high. The combination of this regulatory mechanism and the need for rapid nucleotide synthesis, as well as high production of glutathione dictated by cancer-driving forces, led to the nearly universal observations of reduced global DNA methylation in cancer. Our model provides a natural explanation for differential global DNA methylation levels across cancer types and supports the observation that more malignant cancers tend to exhibit reduced DNA methylation levels. Insights obtained from this work provide useful information about the complexities of cancer due to interplays among competing, dynamic biological processes. .",

Our analyses point to that persistent disruption of the intracellular pH by Fenton reactions may be at the root of cancer development. Specifically, we have statistically demonstrated that Fenton reactions take place in cancer cytosol and mitochondria across all the 14 cancer types, based on cancer tissue gene-expression data integrated via the Michaelis-Menten equation. In addition, we have shown that (i) Fenton reactions in cytosol of the disease cells will continuously increase their pH, to which the cells respond by generating net protons to keep the pH stable through a combination of synthesizing glycolytic ATPs and consuming them by nucleotide syntheses, which may drive cell division to rid of the continuously synthesized nucleotides; and (ii) Fenton reactions in mitochondria give rise to novel ways for ATP synthesis with electrons ultimately coming from H2O2, largely originated from immune cells. A model is developed to link these to cancer development, where some mutations may be selected to facilitate cell division at rates dictated by Fenton reactions.",

        "abstract": "It has been observed that both cancer tissue cells and normal proliferating cells (NPCs) have the Warburg effect. Our goal here is to demonstrate that they do this for different reasons. To accomplish this, we have analyzed the transcriptomic data of over 7000 cancer and control tissues of 14 cancer types in TCGA and data of five NPC types in GEO. Our analyses reveal that NPCs accumulate large quantities of ATPs produced by the respiration process before starting the Warburg effect, to raise the intracellular pH from \u223c6.8 to \u223c7.2 and to prepare for cell division energetically. Once cell cycle starts, the cells start to rely on glycolysis for ATP generation followed by ATP hydrolysis and lactic acid release, to maintain the elevated intracellular pH as needed by cell division since together the three processes are pH neutral. The cells go back to the normal respiration-based ATP production once the cell division phase ends. In comparison, cancer cells have reached their intracellular pH at \u223c7.4 from top down as multiple acid-loading transporters are up-regulated and most acid-extruding ones except for lactic acid exporters are repressed. Cancer cells use continuous glycolysis for ATP production as way to acidify the intracellular space since the lactic acid secretion is decoupled from glycolysis-based ATP generation and is pH balanced by increased expressions of acid-loading transporters. Co-expression analyses suggest that lactic acid secretion is regulated by external, non-pH related signals. Overall, our data strongly suggest that the two cell types have the Warburg effect for very different reasons.",

        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a set of symptoms caused by elevated androgens (male hormones) in females. PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder among women between 18 and 44 years. Currently, the pathogenesis of PCOS remains unclear. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics is becoming more and more useful for medical research, especially in revealing the mechanism of the disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the difference of serum metabolic profiles in patients with PCOS and healthy control to better understand the mechanism of this disease. Ten patients with PCOS and 10 healthy people were recruited for this study. The serum samples were collected for LC/MS analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to discover and identify the potential biomarkers. Six biomarkers were found and identified. The biomarkers belonged to different metabolic pathway including lipid metabolism, carnitine metabolism, androgen metabolism, and bile acid metabolism. Those biomarkers also played different roles in disease progression. Metabolomics is a powerful tool used in research of the mechanism involved in this disease to provide useful information for better understanding of PCOS.",

        "abstract": "What is the central question of this study? What potential biochemical changes are associated with renal parenchyma 6-12\u00a0months after renal transplantation and delayed graft failure? What is the main finding and its importance? Tissue fibrosis, mediated by tissue ischaemia-induced induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 and fibronectin and consequent activation of lysyl oxidase, is a major underlying pathophysiological mechanism that contributes to delayed graft failure several months after renal transplantation. The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the potential biochemical changes associated with renal parenchyma 6-12\u00a0months after renal transplantation and delayed graft failure. Serum concentrations of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 in these subjects always remained elevated. In addition, examination of tissue from needle biopsies confirmed that there were consistent changes in the enzyme lysyl oxidase, which functions as an amine oxidase, modifies lysine residues on collagen and cross-links in a process of modulation of the extracellular matrix. Parenchymal levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 and fibronectin were elevated, as detected by Western blotting. These findings indicate an ongoing ischaemic insult, which might result from increased tissue fibrosis or, in some cases, might be additive with pre-existing pathophysiological factors that constrain proper renal haemodynamics. Thus, increased lysyl oxidase activity, which we assayed, is a potential unfavourable mechanism occurring in these kidneys that are undergoing failure and probably causes increased fibrosis within the organ and causes ischaemia, renovascular hypertension and a cascade leading to renal dysfunction and failure.",

        "abstract": "The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway modulates cytokine release by activating alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (\u03b17nAChR) in monocytes/macrophages. We aimed to determine the role of \u03b17nAChR in lupus nephritis (LN). We enrolled 36 inactive and 35 active LN patients, 34 primary glomerulonephritis patients, and 35 healthy controls. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated, and mRNA expression of \u03b17nAChR, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in monocytes was measured. \u03b17nAChR and IL-10 mRNA levels were significantly decreased, but IL-6 was increased, in LN patients compared with healthy controls or glomerulonephritis patients (all P\u2009<\u20090.01). Interestingly, \u03b17nAChR mRNA levels were negatively correlated to SLEDAI (r\u2009=\u2009-0.68, P\u2009<\u20090.01), anti-dsDNA (r\u2009=\u2009-0.38, P\u2009<\u20090.05), and proteinuria (r\u2009=\u2009-0.49, P\u2009<\u20090.01) levels, and positively correlated to serum complement C3 levels (r\u2009=\u20090.38, P\u2009<\u20090.05) in patients with active LN. Furthermore, \u03b17nAChR mRNA levels were negatively correlated to TNF-\u03b1 (r\u2009=\u2009-0.50, P\u2009<\u20090.01), IL-1\u03b2 (r\u2009=\u2009-0.42, P\u2009<\u20090.05), IL-6 (r\u2009=\u2009-0.69, P\u2009<\u20090.01) mRNA levels, and positively correlated to IL-10 (r\u2009=\u20090.45, P\u2009<\u20090.01). TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 protein levels in the supernatant of cultured monocytes from active LN patients were significantly higher, while IL-10 was lower, than that of healthy controls. PNU-282987, an \u03b17nAChR agonist, significantly decreased TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 but increased IL-10 in the monocyte culture supernatant of active LN patients, which were abolished by an \u03b17nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine. The effects of PNU-282987 were confirmed in lipopolysaccharides-stimulated monocytes. Taken together, these findings suggest that decrease in \u03b17nAChR mRNA levels may play a role in LN and that activation of \u03b17nAChR may inhibit inflammation in LN.",

        "abstract": "Peptidyl arginine deiminase, type II (PADI2) expression has been shown to potentiate multiple different carcinogenesis pathway including breast carcinoma and spontaneous skin neoplasia. The objective of this study was to examine the role of PADI2 in urothelial bladder cancer which has not been evaluated previously. Analysis of mutation and genome amplification of bladder cancer within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that PADI2 is both mutated and amplified in a cohort of bladder cancer patients, with the largest number of mutations detected in urothelial bladder cancer. Even though PADI2 expression was not significantly correlated to survival in bladder cancer patients, it was significantly overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels, as revealed by TCGA data and immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively. PADI2 showed wide expression pattern in bladder cancer tissues but was hardly detected in tumor adjacent normal tissue. RNAi mediated silencing of PADI2 in the bladder cancer cell line T24 did not result in a change of proliferation. Interestingly knockdown of PADI2 expression did not affect Snail1 protein, which is associated with metastatic progression, in these cells. However, PADI2 silencing remarkably attenuated both in vitro migration and invasion- in T24 cells indicating a Snail1-independent effect of PADI2 on invasive potential of urothelial bladder cancer. This was further corroborated by in vivo xenograft assays where PADI2 shRNA harboring T24 cells did not have detectable tumors by week 4 as compared to robust tumors in the control Luciferase shRNA harboring cells. PADI2 silencing did not affect proliferation rates and hence this would suggest that PADI2 knockdown is perhaps causing increased apoptosis as well as transition through the cell cycle, which needs to be confirmed in future studies. Our results reveal a yet undefined role of PADI2 as an oncogene in urothelial bladder cancer.",

The novel contributions of this study include: (i) a new method for predicting if a cellular protein is urine excretory based on unique features of proteins known to be urine excretory; and (ii) a novel method for identifying urinary proteins originating from the urinary system. By integrating these tools, our computational pipeline is capable of predicting the origin of a detected urinary protein, hence offering a novel tool for predicting potential biomarkers of a specific disease, which may have some of their proteins urine excreted. One application is presented for this prediction pipeline to demonstrate the effectiveness of its prediction.

        "abstract": "We report that in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC), extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a vitally important role in defining the characteristics of cancer vs. normal, as it is a compartment with significant enrichment of known OSCC biomarkers, and the number of genes constituting ECM are more prominently upregulated in OSCC than almost all the rest of the cancer types. This is probably due to the constant exposure of oral cavity to external stimuli, resulting in the ECM remodeling, which further is a key player in tumor invasion. While we showed ECM molecules alone could well distinguish oral cancer from normal tissue samples, a significant portion of these predictive ECM molecules, share the same transcriptional regulator, NFKB1, a master regulator of immune response. We further studied the level of involvement of the immune system in OSCC, and found that the immune composition in OSCC is distinctly different from the other cancer types. OSCC has a higher level of infiltration of adaptive immune cells, including B cell, T cell and neutrophil, compared with other cancer types, while a lower level of infiltration of innate immune, including macrophage and monocyte. Previous studies have revealed the roles of ECM and immune system in OSCC development, and our study showed that ECM plays a very prominent role in OSCC, subject to the complex microenvironment in oral cavity, particularly the immune system profile, and our association analysis revealed it is likely the interactions between ECM and immune cells that define the highly invasive property of OSCC.",

        "abstract": "The circular chromosome of Escherichia coli has been suggested to fold into a collection of sequentially consecutive domains, genes in each of which tend to be co-expressed. It has also been suggested that such domains, forming a partition of the genome, are dynamic with respect to the physiological conditions. However, little is known about which DNA segments of the E. coli genome form these domains and what determines the boundaries of these domain segments. We present a computational model here to partition the circular genome into consecutive segments, theoretically suggestive of the physically folded supercoiled domains, along with a method for predicting such domains under specified conditions. Our model is based on a hypothesis that the genome of E. coli is partitioned into a set of folding domains so that the total number of unfoldings of these domains in the folded chromosome is minimized, where a domain is unfolded when a biological pathway, consisting of genes encoded in this DNA segment, is being activated transcriptionally. Based on this hypothesis, we have predicted seven distinct sets of such domains along the E. coli genome for seven physiological conditions, namely exponential growth, stationary growth, anaerobiosis, heat shock, oxidative stress, nitrogen limitation and SOS responses. These predicted folding domains are highly stable statistically and are generally consistent with the experimental data of DNA binding sites of the nucleoid-associated proteins that assist the folding of these domains, as well as genome-scale protein occupancy profiles, hence supporting our proposed model. Our study established for the first time a strong link between a folded E. coli chromosomal structure and the encoded biological pathways and their activation frequencies.",

        "abstract": "Background: The thermophilic anaerobe Clostridium thermocellum is a candidate consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) biocatalyst for cellulosic ethanol production. It is capable of both cellulose solubilization and its fermentation to produce lignocellulosic ethanol. Intolerance to stresses routinely encountered during industrial fermentations may hinder the commercial development of this organism. A previous C. thermocellum ethanol stress study showed that the largest transcriptomic response was in genes and proteins related to nitrogen uptake and metabolism. Results: In this study, C. thermocellum was grown to mid-exponential phase and treated with furfural or heat to a final concentration of 3 g.L\u00a7ssup\u00a7-1\u00a7esup\u00a7 or 68\u00b0C respectively to investigate general and specific physiological and regulatory stress responses. Samples were taken at 10, 30, 60 and 120 min post-shock, and from untreated control fermentations, for transcriptomic analyses and fermentation product determinations and compared to a published dataset from an ethanol stress study. Urea uptake genes were induced following furfural stress, but not to the same extent as ethanol stress and transcription from these genes was largely unaffected by heat stress. The largest transcriptomic response to furfural stress was genes for sulfate transporter subunits and enzymes in the sulfate assimilatory pathway, although these genes were also affected late in the heat and ethanol stress responses. Lactate production was higher in furfural treated culture, although the lactate dehydrogenase gene was not differentially expressed under this condition. Other redox related genes such as a copy of the rex gene, a bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase and adjacent genes did show lower expression after furfural stress compared to the control, heat and ethanol fermentation profiles. Heat stress induced expression from chaperone related genes and overlap was observed with the responses to the other stresses. This study suggests the involvement of C. thermocellum genes with functions in oxidative stress protection, electron transfer, detoxification, sulfur and nitrogen acquisition, and DNA repair mechanisms in its stress responses and the use of different regulatory networks to coordinate and control adaptation. Conclusions: This study has identified C. thermocellum gene regulatory motifs and aspects of physiology and gene regulation for further study. The nexus between future systems biology studies and recently developed genetic tools for C. thermocellum offers the potential for more rapid strain development and for broader insights into this organism's physiology and regulation. \u00a9 2013 Wilson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) play important roles in both chromosome packaging and gene regulation in bacteria. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain elusive particularly for how NAPs contribute to chromosome packaging. We report here a characterization of the binding sites for several major NAPs in E. coli, namely H-NS, IHF, Fis, Dps and a non-NAP protein, FNR, in terms of the physical properties of their binding DNA. Our study shows that (i) as compared with flanking regions, the binding sites for IHF, Fis and FNR tend to have high intrinsic curvature, while no characterized pattern of intrinsic curvature distribution around those of H-NS and Dps; (ii) all the binding sites analyzed in this study except those of H-NS are characterized by high structural flexibility; (iii) the intrinsic curvature and flexibility at the binding sites for Fis and IHF are found to be coupled with the sequence specificity required in their binding, while the physical properties of the binding regions for both Dps and FNR are independent of sequence specificity. Our data suggest that physical properties of DNA sequence may contribute to binding of NAPs and mediate genome packaging and transcriptional regulation of the downstream genes. Our results should be informative for prediction of NAPs binding sites and understanding of the bacterial chromosome packaging.",

We present a computational study of transcriptomic and genomic data of both ethanol-stressed and ethanol-adapted E. coli cells with computationally predicated ethanol-binding proteins and experimentally identified ethanol tolerance genes. Our analysis suggests: (1) ethanol damages cell wall and membrane integrity, causing increased stresses, particularly reactive oxygen species, which damages DNA and reduces the O 2 level; (2) decreased cross-membrane proton gradient from membrane damage, coupled with hypoxia, leads to reduced ATP production by aerobic respiration, driving cells to rely more on fatty acid oxidation, anaerobic respiration and fermentation for ATP production; (3) the reduced ATP generation results in substantially decreased synthesis of macromolecules; (4) ethanol can directly bind 213 proteins including transcription factors, altering their functions; (5) all these changes together induce multiple stress responses, reduced biosynthesis, cell viability and growth; and (6) ethanol-adapted E. coli cells restore the majority of these reduced activities through selection of specific genomic mutations and alteration of stress responses, ultimately restoring normal ATP production, macromolecule biosynthesis, and growth. These new insights into the energy and mass balance will inform design of more ethanol-tolerant strains.",

        "abstract": "SummaryImproving nitrogen (N) remobilization from aboveground to underground organs during yearly shoot senescence is an important goal for sustainable production of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) as a biofuel crop. Little is known about the genetic control of senescence and N use efficiency in perennial grasses such as switchgrass, which limits our ability to improve the process.Switchgrass aboveground organs (leaves, stems and inflorescences) and underground organs (crowns and roots) were harvested every month over a 3-yr period. Transcriptome analysis was performed to identify genes differentially expressed in various organs during development.Total N content in aboveground organs increased from spring until the end of summer, then decreased concomitant with senescence, while N content in underground organs exhibited an increase roughly matching the decrease in shoot N during fall. Hundreds of senescence-associated genes were identified in leaves and stems. Functional grouping indicated that regulation of transcription and protein degradation play important roles in shoot senescence. Coexpression networks predict important roles for five switchgrass NAC (NAM, ATAF1,2, CUC2) transcription factors (TFs) and other TF family members in orchestrating metabolism of carbohydrates, N and lipids, protein modification/degradation, and transport processes during senescence.This study establishes a molecular basis for understanding and enhancing N remobilization and conservation in switchgrass.",

Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) are the most important enzymes for complex carbohydrate metabolism. With an increasing number of plant and plant-associated microbial genomes and metagenomes being sequenced, there is an urgent need of automatic tools for genomic data mining of CAZymes. We developed the dbCAN web server in 2012 to provide a public service for automated CAZyme annotation for newly sequenced genomes. Here, dbCAN2 (http://cys.bios.niu.edu/dbCAN2) is presented as an updated meta server, which integrates three state-of-the-art tools for CAZome (all CAZymes of a genome) annotation: (i) HMMER search against the dbCAN HMM (hidden Markov model) database; (ii) DIAMOND search against the CAZy pre-annotated CAZyme sequence database and (iii) Hotpep search against the conserved CAZyme short peptide database. Combining the three outputs and removing CAZymes found by only one tool can significantly improve the CAZome annotation accuracy. In addition, dbCAN2 now also accepts nucleotide sequence submission, and offers the service to predict physically linked CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs), which will be a very useful online tool for identifying putative polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) in microbial genomes or metagenomes.",

The results show that the temperature's warming rate is 0.4 \u2103/100a under the two stabilization scenarios,in addition,the warming tendency is much smaller than those under the SRES A1B and B1 scenarios. Warming is most remarkable in winter and spring,with warming amplitude becoming generally greater from low latitudes toward high latitudes,and next in summer and autumn,which leads to the reduction in temperature differences between seasons. Although the annual mean precipitation still increases when the GHGs concentration stabilizes,the increasing amplitude tends to be stable at 11%(720 mL/m3) and 8%(550 mL/m3) ,respectively. The increase in winter precipitation is more apparent than in other seasons;the increase also becomes larger from low latitudes toward high latitudes. The summer and autumn precipitation decreases 10%\uff5e30% in most areas of China.",

        "abstract": "The serious impacts of both sustaining and serious droughts and severe rainstorm and floods on the life and social and economic development over the world and in China are well-known. Many studies are focused on the assessments and predictions with the extended data of the precipitation and droughts/floods and with the complicated climate models, as well as with the observation of a number of human emission scenarios. A review of the key results shows that the precipitation over the world and in China sees a multi-decadal oscillation during the 20th century. The regional floods and droughts occurred frequently over the world and in China during the last 50 years, such as floods along Yangtze River Valley and droughts over North China. The precipitation over the world and in China during the 21st century is predicted to be on the increase due to increased human emissions and global warming, especially an increasing intensity of precipitation over the most middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The dry days over some areas of the middle and low latitudes are predicted on the increase during the 21st century. These results should attract attentions from a number of sectors, such as hydrology, agriculture, forestry, transportation and health.",

        "abstract": "Radiation is an important process in atmosphere.Currently the radiative parameterization schemes used in climate models are mainly simplified arithmetic,which show great uncertainty in climate change projection.To better understand the effects of radiative parameterizations on cloud and radiation simulation,a new parameterization scheme,Fu-Liou scheme,is introduced into NCC/IAP T63 AOGCM to replace the old scheme,Morcrette scheme. NCC/IAP T63 AOGCM is a spectral model with triangular truncation at wave number 63.The horizontal resolution is 1.875\u00b0\u00d71.875\u00b0 for both atmosphere and ocean component,and there are 16 and 30 vertical layers for atmosphere and ocean respectively.The main differences between two radiative schemes are in such aspects as division of waveband,approximation for radiative transfer,and treatment of cloud layer overlap in radiation calculation.In Fu-Liou scheme,the waveband is divided into 18 sub-wavebands,6 for shortwave and 12 for long wave,while there are only 8 sub-wavebands(2 for shortwave and 6 for long wave) in Morcrette scheme.Fu-Liou scheme adopts \u03b4-four-stream approximation which has high calculating accuracy,and uses the binary cloud when calculating the cloud effects on radiation.Two 20-year integrations are processed by use of the two schemes respectively.The first 10 years are used for coupling adjustment,and the last 10 years for analysis.Two types of monthly mean data,40-year reanalysis data of European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts(ECMWF)(ERA-40) and data from Earth Radiation Budget Experiment(ERBE),are used to verify the results. The effects of the two schemes on the simulation of cloud and radiation are analysed in detail.The main results are as follows: Firstly,the incident radiation at TOA simulated by two schemes differs obviously,which is mainly caused by the difference in radiative arithmetic.Secondly,in clear sky the shortwave absorption of Fu-Liou scheme is generally lower than Morcrette scheme,especially in middle and high latitudes of winter hemisphere.The planetary albedo simulated by Fu-Liou scheme is closer to ERBE data than Morcrette scheme between 60\u00b0S and 60\u00b0N,mainly due to the improvement of simulation on clear-sky albedo.Thirdly, the simulated net radiation at TOA in Fu-Liou scheme is improved obviously as compared with Morcrette scheme except for part of the east Pacific and east Atlantic where the cloud cover decreases remarkably in winter.Finally,the low stratocumulus simulated by Fu-Liou scheme decreases remarkably,which is caused by the weakening of static stability over ocean.The high cloud increases obviously,mainly due to the intensifying of convection in tropical region,as compared with Morcrette scheme.Although the cloud cover decreases,the use of binary cloud increases the cloud shortwave absorption in Fu-Liou scheme which improves the weak absorption in Morcrette scheme in some degree.",

The results showed that the growth of Microcystis was significantly inhibited when the addition of anaerobic leachate from sediment in M11 culture medium was high (> or = 20% V/V). The maximum biomass of Microcystis was lower than that grown in pure M11 culture medium. But there was an obvious promotion on the growth of Anabaena when anaerobic leachate from sediment was added. The growth rate of Anabaena increased 36.6%, 47.2% and 36.0%, respectively, compared to M11 culture medium when adding 2%, 20% and 50% (V/V) anaerobic leachate. Compared to adding anaerobic leachate, aerobic leachate had no influence on the growth of Microcystis, while the growth rate of Anabaena was promoted by aerobic leachate. The growth rate of Anabaena increased 37.2% compared with M11 when adding 20% (V/V) of aerobic leachate. But after addition of Fe-citrate to the mixed culture medium (50% M11 culture medium +50% anaerobic leachate), the maximum biomass of Microcystis significantly increased. The results suggest that high organic matter concentration decreases iron availability for Microcystis.",

In this study, the block effect due to soil variability is defined and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) artificial neural network (ANN) with Block Effect (BE) is proposed to improve the accuracy of spatial interpolation of soil moisture and nutrients. The new RBFANNBE method is evaluated using soil moistures and organic matters observed from an experimental site in the north Yangzhou region of Jiangsu Province. Two sets of data samples are used in the RBFANNBE training process. The RBFANNBE performance is compared to the conventional RBFANN method and the ordinary Kriging (OK) method using the mean square errors (M se) and the goodness of prediction fit (G). The results show that RBFANNBE reduce M se by 19.0%-62.2% and improve G by 8.9%-28.8% compared to the OK method. In comparison with RBFANN, a 10.0%-48.8% reduction in M se and a 3.4%-22.0% improvement in G are obtained by RBFANNBE, respectively. The new RBFANNBE method has better generalization capabilities over the RBFANN and OK methods. Thus, RBFANNBE is a promising method for studying the spatial distribution of soil properties.",

        "abstract": "Taking a horizontal terrace on a slightly sloping land with a gradient less than 2\u00b0 in northern Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province for example, spatial variability of soil moisture in the terrace was analyzed. Soil moisture of a terrace on the upper level is higher than that of the lower one, and soil moisture of the inner side is higher than that of the outside in the same terrace. Based on the distribution of soil moisture, an effective method named Kriging using trends as auxiliary information (KTAI) was proposed. The method taking into account the effects of both elevation of different terrace levels and different locations of the same level terrace on soil moisture, was used to interpolate the soil moisture in terraces. KTAI is useful for studying spatial variability of soil moisture in terraces and extending the application of geostatistics in spatial variability of soil moisture.",

(1) Leaf area index and yield are approximately normally distributed. (2) Under the discussing conditions, rice yield and leaf area index during most of developmental stages are spatially structured. (3) Yield and leaf area index during booting stage, heading stage and milk stage are positively correlated across up to 12 m or so and their correlations are considered significant across different distances depending on different developmental stages. The theory of indicator Kriging was used for reference, the method of the indicator value distribution which was proposed in the article was used to analyze the relationships between yield and combined leaf area index obtained from several developmental stages. The method is significant to perform precision farming and estimate rice yield and can be used for reference in studying spatial relationship between one variable and several variables or that between one variable and dynamic distributions of the other one.",

        "abstract": "It is very important for the implementation of precision agriculture to study the relationship between crop yield and spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture and nutrients, which requires improving the methods of studying such relationship to speed up the process of precision agriculture.The relationship between crop yield and spatial variability of soil moisture and nutrients at the seedling stage and grain-filling stage of winter wheat was analyzed with both geostatistics and traditional statistics, and a method to integratedly evaluate soil moisture and nutrient status through integrated indicator rate was proposed. The relationship between integrated indicator rate and crop yield showed integrated indicator rate was significantly correlated with crop yield in the range of 67.8 m, and the greater integrated indicator rate was, the greater yield was. Their kriging maps indicated the distribution of integrated indicator rate was similar to that of yield. Integrated indicator rate could explain 58.4% of yield variation which was 17.4% more than the result of multivariate step regression analysis. Both multivariate step regression analysis of soil moisture and nutrients and crop yield and simple regression analysis of integrated indicator rate and crop yield indicated that soil moisture and nutrients could explain 33.3%-58.4% of yield variation which was 0-5.2% more than only considering soil nutrients, and meanwhile soil moisture and nutrients of both seedling stage and grain-filling stage could explain 41%-58.4% of yield variation, 4.3%-16.5% more than considering soil moisture and nutrients of either seedling stage or grain-filling stage. Integrated indicator rate provides a method for describing spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture and nutrients and their relationships with crop yield. Its kriging map is a useful tool of integratedly evaluating soil moisture and nutrient status, and provides an available reference for implementation of precision agriculture by comparing with the kriging map of yield.",

Both morphological and molecular identification indicated that the newly invaded species is the bluegrass webworm moth,Parapediasia teterrella,a moth native to North America.F'ield investigation showed that the species was widely distributed in Shanghai and caused serious damages to turfgrasses,especially C. dactylon.In some parks,the maximum population density of this pest reached to 740 individuals/m.It is believed that this insect species should be listed as a new invasive pest in China due to its exotic and established characteristics as well as serious economic effects in the new regions.Therefore,it is urgently necessary to focus on the integrated management of newly introduced P.teterrella in order to reduce its threat to turfgrasses and gardening landscapes in China.",

        "abstract": "Atypical cadherin Celsr3, a regulator of planar cell polarity, is critical for the development of the axonal blueprint. We previously showed that expression of Celsr3 is necessary to establish forebrain connections such as the anterior commissure and thalamocortical and corticospinal tracts. The requirement for Celsr3 during hippocampal wiring and its action in the hippocampus remain largely unexplored. Here, we compared the connectivity and maturation of the hippocampal formation in Celsr3|Foxg1 and Celsr3|Dlx mice. Celsr3 is inactivated in the whole telencephalon, including the hippocampal primordium, in Celsr3|Foxg1 mice, and in the early basal telencephalon, including ganglionic eminences and ventral diencephalon, in Celsr3|Dlx mice. Behavioral tests showed that both mutants were hyperactive and had impaired learning and memory. Abnormal cytoarchitecture of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus was found in the Celsr3|Foxg1 mutant, in which afferent and efferent hippocampal pathways, as well as intrinsic connections, were dramatically disrupted. In Celsr3|Dlx mutant mice, hippocampal cytoarchitecture was mildly affected and extrinsic and intrinsic connectivity moderately disturbed. In both mutants, pyramidal neurons in CA1 harbored atrophic dendritic trees, with decreased synapse density and increased proportion of symmetric versus asymmetric synapses, and long-term potentiation was altered. In contrast, mutant hippocampal neurons extended neurites that were normal, even longer than those of control neurons, indicating that anomalies in vivo are secondary to defective connections. Postnatal neurogenesis was preserved and mutant interneurons were able to migrate to the hippocampus. Thus, like in neocortex, Celsr3 is required for hippocampal development, connectivity and function, and for pyramidal cell maturation.",

The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and two unidentified phospholipids. Ubiquinone 10 was the predominant lipoquinone. The DNA G+C content of strain KAUST100406-0324(T) was 64.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the novel strain belonged to the family Rhodobacteraceae of the class Alphaproteobacteria but formed a distinct evolutionary lineage from other bacterial species with validly published names. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the novel strain was distantly related, but formed a monophyletic cluster with, those of bacteria from two moderately halophilic genera, Hwanghaeicola and Maribius. The similarity of the sequence between the novel strain KAUST100406-0324(T) and the type strains Hwanghaeicola aestuarii Y26(T) (accession number FJ230842), Maribius pelagius B5-6(T) (DQ514326) and Maribius salinus CL-SP27(T) (AY906863) were 94.5\u200a%, 95.2\u200a% and 95.3\u200a%, respectively. Based on the physiological, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic characteristics presented in this study, we propose that this strain represents a novel species of a new genus in the family Rhodobacteraceae, for which the name of Profundibacterium mesophilum gen. nov., sp. nov. was proposed, with KAUST100406-0324(T) (\u200a=\u200aJCM 17872(T) \u200a=\u200aNRRL B-59665(T)) as the type strain.",

        "abstract": "Here, we investigated the degradation kinetics of butenolide, a promising antifouling compound, under various environmental conditions. The active ingredient of the commercial antifoulant SeaNine 211, 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (DCOIT), was used as positive control. The results showed that the degradation rate increased with increasing temperature. Half-lives of butenolide at 4 \u00b0C, 25 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C were>64 d, 30.5 d and 3.9 d, respectively. Similar half-lives were recorded for DCOIT: >64 d at 4 \u00b0C, 27.9 d at 25 \u00b0C and 4.5d at 40 \u00b0C. Exposure to sunlight accelerated the degradation of both butenolide and DCOIT. The photolysis half-lives of butenolide and DCOIT were 5.7 d and 6.8 d, respectively, compared with 9.7 d and 14.4 d for the dark control. Biodegradation led to the fastest rate of butenolide removal from natural seawater, with a half-life of 0.5 d, while no obvious degradation was observed for DCOIT after incubation for 4 d. The biodegradative ability of natural seawater for butenolide was attributed mainly to marine bacteria. During the degradation of butenolide and DCOIT, a gradual decrease in antifouling activity was observed, as indicated by the increased settlement percentage of cypris larvae from barnacle Balanus amphitrite. Besides, increased cell growth of marine diatom Skeletonema costatum demonstrated that the toxicity of seawater decreased gradually without generation of more toxic by-products. Overall, rapid degradation of butenolide in natural seawater supported its claim as a promising candidate for commercial antifouling industry.",

A recent global ban on the use of organotin compounds as antifouling agents has further raised demand for safe and effective antifouling compounds. In this study, 49 secondary metabolites, including diterpenoids, steroids, and polyketides, were isolated from soft corals, gorgonians, brown algae, and fungi collected along the coast of China, and their antifouling activity was tested against cyprids of the barnacle Balanus (Amphibalanus) amphitrite. Twenty of the compounds were found to inhibit larval settlement significantly at a concentration of 25 \u03bcg ml(-1). Two briarane diterpenoids, juncin O (2) and juncenolide H (3), were the most promising non-toxic antilarval settlement candidates, with EC50 values less than 0.13 \u03bcg ml(-1) and a safety ratio (LC50/EC50) higher than 400. A preliminary structure-activity relationships study indicated that both furanon and furan moieties are important for antifouling activity. Intriguingly, the presence of hydroxyls enhanced their antisettlement activity.",

Bioassay-guided column chromatography techniques were used to separate and purify compounds. Extensive spectral analyses including 1D NMR spectra and GC-MS were employed for structure elucidation of the compounds. Antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds towards eight marine bacterial strains was measures by optical density, while antilarval activity was evaluated in settlement inhibition assays with laboratory-reared Balanus amphitrite and Bugula neritina larvae. In total, nine compounds including six diketopiperazine were obtained. Among them, cyclo-(Tyr-Pro), cyclo-(Tyr-Ile), cyclo-(Phe-Pro), cyclo-(Val-Pro), 3-phenyl- 2-propenoic acid, and uracil had various antibacterial activities towards five marine fouling bacteria, furthermore, bis(2- ethylhexyl)phthalate, cyclo-(Tyr-Ile), cyclo-(Phe-Pro), cyclo-(Val-Pro), and 3-phenyl-2-propenoic acid showed antilarval effect on larval settlement of barnacle Balanus amphitrite and bryozoan Bugula neritina. The results suggested that marine bacterium Pseudomonas rhizosphaerae could produce potent antibacterial and antilarval diketopiperazine and benzenetype secondary metabolites.",

Furthermore, controlling the release of butenolide from paints into seawater is technically challenging. A coating was developed by mixing butenolide with a biodegradable polymer, poly (\u03b5-caprolactone)-based polyurethane, and a one-month in situ anti-biofilm test was conducted in a subtidal area. The constant release of butenolide from the surface suggested that its release was well controlled. Direct observation and confocal microscope investigation indicated that the coating was effective against both biofilm formation and attachment of large fouling organisms. Metatranscriptomic analysis of biofilm samples implied that the coating selectively inhibited the adhesion of microbes from a variety of phyla and targeted particular functional pathways including energy metabolism, drug transport and toxin release. These integrated analyses demonstrated the potential application of this butenolide/polymer coating as an anti-biofilm material.",

We describe here the discovery and characterization of an extended family of 14 new analogues from four Tistrella and Thalassospira isolates. These potent calpain 1 protease inhibitors belong to six structure classes in which the length and composition of the acylpeptide side chain varies extensively. Genomic sequence analysis of the thalassospiramide-producing microbes revealed related, genus-specific biosynthetic loci encoding hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthases consistent with thalassospiramide assembly. The bioinformatics analysis of the gene clusters suggests that structural diversity, which ranges from the 803.4 Da thalassospiramide C to the 1291.7 Da thalassospiramide F, results from a complex sequence of reactions involving amino acid substrate channeling and enzymatic multimodule skipping and iteration. Preliminary biochemical analysis of the N-terminal nonribosomal peptide synthetase module from the Thalassospira TtcA megasynthase supports a biosynthetic model in which in cis amino acid activation competes with in trans activation to increase the range of amino acid substrates incorporated at the N terminus. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

Compounds 1-5 showed selective antibacterial activity against eight bacterial strains with the MIC (minimum inhibiting concentrations) values between 1.25 and 20.0 \u00b5M. The cytotoxic, antifouling, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of these compounds were also examined.",

Antilarval activity of the compounds was evaluated in settlement inhibition assays with laboratory-reared Balanus amphitrite and Bugula neritina larvae, while antibacterial activity was assessed with disc diffusion bioassay on growth inhibition of six marine bacterial species. In total, nine compounds were obtained. Among them, 3-phenyl-2-propenoic acid, cyclo-(Phe-Pro) and cyclo-(Val-Pro) had various antibacterial activities against three fouling bacteria, furthermore, 3-phenyl-2-propenoic acid and bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate effectively inhibited larval settlement of B. neritina and B. amphitrite larvae, respectively, indicating that the two compounds are potential natural antifouling agents. \u00a9 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

In larval bioassays, eight compounds showed strong anti-larval settlement activities, with EC(50) values <10 microg ml(-1). Through an analysis of the structure-activity relationship of these compounds, it was found that (1) the structural difference between flavones and isoflavones did not affect their AF activities; (2) the 5-hydroxyl group on the skeletons played a key role in AF activities; and (3) the presence of hydroxyl group or bulky group on C3 significantly reduced AF activities. A hydrolysis experiment using genistein, a typical active compound in this study, indicated that it was decomposed in the marine environment by hydrolysis reaction and that the degradation speed was significantly affected by pH. In a field AF test, genistein inhibited the attachment of B. amphitrite on panels coated with genistein-paint mixtures.",

        "abstract": "Since early 2008, an increasing number of countries have ratified an international treaty to ban the application of antifouling (AF) coatings based on organotin compounds (eg tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin). As a result, the demand for environmentally friendly, non-toxic or low-toxicity AF compounds and technologies (green AF agents) has become an urgent reality. Marine coatings based on Cu2O and various other biocides have a negative impact on the environment and they must eventually be replaced by new, effective, and environmentally friendly AF compounds. This mini-review describes important AF compounds discovered from a variety of organisms from 2004 until mid 2009, and discusses recent and general trends in the discovery of AF compounds. Finally, a perspective on the future of AF compound development is presented. The discussion is aimed at updating scientists and engineers on the current challenges facing AF research.",

The 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)) of the commercial proteases were 10 times lower than those of other enzymes. Crude proteases from six deep-sea Pseudoalteromonas species significantly decreased larval attachment at concentrations of 0.03 to 1 mIU ml(-1). The EC(50) of the pure protease from the bacterium Pseudoalteromonas issachenkonii UST041101-043 was close to 1 ng ml(-1) (0.1 mIU ml(-1)). The protease and trypsin individually incorporated in a water-soluble paint matrix inhibited biofouling in a field experiment. There are certain correlations between production of proteases by bacterial films and inhibition of larval attachment. None of the bacteria with biofilms that induced attachment of B. neritina produced proteolytic enzymes, whereas most of the bacteria that formed inhibitive biofilms produced proteases. Our investigation demonstrated the potential use of proteolytic enzymes for antifouling defense.",

UST040711-290 was chosen for the isolation of bioactive antifouling compounds through bioassay-guided isolation procedure. A branched-chain fatty acid, 12-methyltetradecanoid acid (12-MTA) was purified, and it strongly inhibited the larval settlement of the polychaete Hydroides elegans. Streptomyces sp. UST040711-290 produced the highest yield of 12-MTA when the bacterium was cultured at 30 degrees C and pH 7.0 in a modified MGY medium. To investigate the potential antifouling mechanism of 12-MTA in the larval settlement of Hydroides elegans, the expression level of four marker genes, namely, Ran GTPase activating protein (GAP), ATP synthase (AS), NADH dehydrogenase (ND), and cell division cycle protein (CDC), was compared among the untreated larvae (the control), isobutylmethylxanthine (an effective settlement inducer), and 12-MTA-treated larvae. The 12-MTA treatment down-regulated the expression of GAP and up-regulated the expression of AS in the H. elegans larvae, but did not affect the expression of ND and CDC. This study provides the first evidence that a branched-chain fatty acid produced by a marine bacterium isolated from deep-sea sediment effectively inhibited the larval settlement of the biofouling polychaete H. elegans and its effects on the expression of genes important for larval settlement.",

However, traditional screening for bioactive natural compounds is greatly hindered by the lack of a systematic way of cataloguing the chemical profiles of bacterial strains found in nature. Here we present a chemical fingerprint database of marine bacteria based on their secondary metabolite profiles, acquired by high-resolution LC-MS. Till now, 1,430 bacterial strains spanning 168 known species collected from different marine environments were cultured and profiled. Using this database, we demonstrated that secondary metabolite profile similarity is approximately, but not always, correlated with taxonomical similarity. We also validated the ability of this database to find species-specific metabolites, as well as to discover known bioactive compounds from previously unknown sources. An online interface to this database, as well as the accompanying software, is provided freely for the community to use.",

Their structures and the relative configurations of 1-3 were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods including NOESY spectra and chemical conversions. A transetherification reaction was also observed in which cochliomycin B (2) in a solution of CDCl(3) slowly rearranged to give cochliomycin A (1) at room temperature. These resorcylic acid lactones were evaluated against the larval settlement of barnacle Balanus amphitrite, and antifouling activity was detected for the first time for this class of metabolites. The antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of these compounds were also examined.",

Five poly-ethers were isolated and partially characterized based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS); two of them showed inhibitory effects on biofilm formation of marine bacteria and larval settlement of macro-foulers but did not produce any adverse effects on the phenotypes of zebra fish embryos at a concentration of 5\u03bcg ml(-1). The effect of culture duration on the production of the poly-ethers and the bioactivity of the relevant extracts was monitored over a period of 12 days. The total crude poly-ether production increased from day 2 to day 5 and the highest bioactivity was observed on day 3. The poly-ethers were found to be localized in the cellular fraction of the extracts, implying their natural occurrence. The potent bioactivity of these poly-ethers together with their high natural abundance in bacteria makes them promising candidates as ingredients in antifouling applications.",

These bacteria belong to Pseudoalteromonas spp., which were identified by the 16S rDNA sequence. Of the six proteases produced, two were neutral cold-adapted proteases that showed their optimal activity at pH 7-8 and at temperature close to 35 degrees C, and the other four were alkaline proteases that showed their optimal activity at pH 9 and at temperature of 40-45 degrees C. The neutral cold-adapted protease E1 showed its optimal activity at a sodium chloride concentration of 2 M, whereas the activity of the other five proteases decreased at elevated sodium chloride concentrations. Protease E1 was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and its molecular mass was 34 kDa, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The molecular weight of protease E1 was determined to be 32,411 Da by mass spectrometric analysis. Phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride (PMSF) did not inhibit the activity of this protease, whereas it was partially inhibited by ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid sodium salt (EDTA-Na). De novo amino acid sequencing proved protease E1 to be a novel protein.",

The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic methods. Compound 1 showed weak cytotoxicity against A549, HONE1, and HeLa cancer cell lines and strong antilarval activity towards Bugula neritina larvae with an EC 50 value of 5.8 \u03bcg/ml. Compound 5 showed moderate cytotoxicity against A549, HONE1, and HeLa cell lines, and the epimer mixture 4/5 (weight ratio 3 : 2) exhibited potent cytotoxicity against A549 and HONE1 cell lines with IC 50 values of 4.2 and 4.8 mg/ml, which indicated that epimers 4 and 5 might have a synergistic effect on their cytotoxicity against A549 and HONE1 cell lines. \u00a9 2010 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG.",

        "abstract": "Mizolastine, an antihistamine pharmaceutical, was found to significantly inhibit larval settlement of the barnacle Amphibalanus (=Balanus) amphitrite, the bryozoan Bugula neritina, and the polychaete Hydroides elegans with EC(50) values of 4.2, 11.2, and 4.1 microg ml(-1), respectively. No toxicity against the larvae of these three species was observed at the concentration range tested during incubations with mizolastine. To determine whether the anti-settlement activity of mizolastine is reversible, recovery bioassays using these three species were conducted. More than 70% of the larvae that had been exposed for 4 h to mizolastine at concentrations four-fold greater than their respective EC(50) values completed normal metamorphosis. The results of the recovery bioassay provide evidence that the anti-settlement effect of mizolastine is reversible in addition to being nontoxic. The anti-settlement activities of several intermediates of the synthesis process of mizolastine were also examined. One of the intermediates, 2-chloro-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole, inhibited larval settlement and metamorphosis with low toxicity. These results may improve the understanding of the key functional group responsible for the anti-settlement activity of mizolastine.",

        "abstract": "Marine biofouling refers to the unwanted accumulation of fouling organisms, such as barnacles, on artificial surfaces, resulting in severe consequences for marine industries. Meleagrin is a potential nontoxic antifoulant that is isolated from the fungus Penicillium sp.; however, its mechanistic effect mode of action on larval settlement remains unknown. Here, we applied iTRAQ coupled with 2D LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis to investigate the effect of meleagrin on the proteomic expression profile of cyprid development and aging in the barnacle Balanus amphitrite . Fifty proteins were differentially expressed in response to treatment with meleagrin, among which 26 proteins were associated with cyprid development/aging and 24 were specifically associated with the meleagrin treatment. The 66 proteins that were associated with aging only remained unaltered during exposure to meleagrin. Using KEGG analysis, those proteins were assigned to several groups, including metabolic pathways, ECM-receptor interactions, and the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Among the 24 proteins that were not related to the development/aging process, expression of the cyprid major protein (CMP), a vitellogenin-like protein, increased after the meleagrin treatment, which suggested that meleagrin might affect the endocrine system and prevent the larval molting cycle. With the exception of the chitin binding protein that mediates the molting process and ATPase-mediated energy processes, the majority of proteins with significant effects in previous studies in response to cyprid treatment with butenolide and polyether B remained unchanged in the present study, suggesting that meleagrin may exhibit a different mechanism.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluated the potential adverse effects of butenolide, a promising antifouling compound, using the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma), a model fish for marine ecotoxicology. The active ingredient used in the commercial antifoulant SeaNine 211, 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (DCOIT) was employed as the positive control. Adult marine medaka (4-month-old) were exposed to various concentrations of butenolide or DCOIT for 28 days and then depurated in clean seawater for 14 days (recovery). A suite of sensitive biomarkers, including hepatic oxidative stress, neuronal signal transmission, endocrine disruption, and reproductive function, was used to measure significant biological effects induced by the chemicals. Compared to DCOIT, chronic exposure to butenolide induced a lower extent of oxidative stress in the liver of male and female medaka. Furthermore, butenolide-exposed fish could recover faster from oxidative stress than fish exposed to DCOIT. Regarding neurotransmission, DCOIT significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the brain of both male and female medaka, whereas this was not significant for butenolide. In addition, plasma estradiol (E2) level was elevated and testosterone (T) level was decreased in male medaka exposed to DCOIT. This greatly imbalanced sex hormones ratio (E2/T) in exposed males, indicating that DCOIT is a potent endocrine disruptive chemical. In contrast, butenolide induced only moderate effects on sex hormone levels in exposed males, which could be gradually recovered during depuration. Moreover, the endocrine disruptive effect induced by butenolide did not affect normal development of offspring. In contrast, DCOIT-exposed fish exhibited a decrease of egg production and impaired reproductive success. Overall, the above findings demonstrated that chronic exposure to butenolide induced transient, reversible biological effect on marine medaka, while DCOIT could impair reproductive success of fish, as evident by clear alterations of the E2/T ratio. The relatively low toxicity of butenolide on marine biota highlights its promising application in the antifouling industry. The present findings also emphasize gender difference in fish susceptibility to chemical treatment (male>female), which is an important consideration for ecological risk assessment.",

The fungus grew well on tryptone or yeast extract media, slowly on ammonium or nitrate media, and not at all on urea media. In nutrient-enriched cultivation media, this strain produced antibiotic and antifouling compounds in the presence of glucose or xylose. These bioactive compounds were rarely produced in the absence of the sugars, even though the fungal cells grew well under these conditions. Fungal extracts decreased the attachment of bryozoan larvae ( Bugula neritina ) and showed antibiotic activity towards 6 tested bacterial species. Metabolite profiles of the fungus revealed by gas chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) showed clear differences when glucose was present in or absent from the culture medium.

In this study, a series of new butenolide derivatives with various amine side chains was synthesized and evaluated for their anti-larval settlement activities in the barnacle, Balanus amphitrite. Side chain modification of butenolide resulted in butenolides 3c-3d, which possessed desirable physico-chemical properties and demonstrated highly effective non-toxic anti-larval settlement efficacy. A structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that varying the alkyl side chain had a notable effect on anti-larval settlement activity and that seven to eight carbon alkyl side chains with a tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) substituent on an amine terminal were optimal in terms of bioactivity. Analysis of the physico-chemical profile of butenolide analogues indicated that lipophilicity is a very important physico-chemical parameter contributing to bioactivity.",

Although their natural product biosynthetic potential is high, robust molecular tools to support the heterologous expression of large biosynthetic gene clusters in Bacillus hosts are rare. Herein we adapt transformation-associated recombination (TAR) in yeast to design a single genomic capture and expression vector for antibiotic production in Bacillus subtilis. After validating this direct cloning \"plug-and-play\" approach with surfactin, we genetically interrogated amicoumacin biosynthetic gene cluster from the marine isolate Bacillus subtilis 1779. Its heterologous expression allowed us to explore an unusual maturation process involving the N-acyl-asparagine pro-drug intermediates preamicoumacins, which are hydrolyzed by the asparagine-specific peptidase into the active component amicoumacin A. This work represents the first direct cloning based heterologous expression of natural products in the model organism B. subtilis and paves the way to the development of future genome mining efforts in this genus.",

        "abstract": "Modern antifouling coatings use heavy metals and toxic organic molecules to prevent biofouling, the undesirable growth of marine organisms on man-made substrata. In an ongoing survey of deep-sea microorganisms aimed at finding low toxic antifouling metabolites, an actinomycete bacterium was isolated from the Pacific sediment at the depth of about 5000 m. The bacterium was closely related to Streptomyces fungicidicus (99% similarity) according to 16S ribosomal RNA sequence information. The spent culture medium of this bacterium inhibited barnacle larval attachment. Bioassay-guided fractionation was employed to isolate antifouling compounds. The ethyl acetate extract was fractionated by using an open silica gel column. Active fractions were further purified on a HPLC C18 column. Five diketopiperazines, cyclo-(L-Leu-L-Pro), cyclo-(L-Phe-L-Pro), cyclo-(L-Val-L-Pro), cyclo-(L-Trp-L-Pro), and cyclo-(L-Leu-L-Val) were isolated for the first time from a deep sea bacterium, and the structures of the compounds were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The pure diketopiperazines were tested for antilarval activity using the barnacle Balanus amphitrite. Effective concentrations that inhibited 50% larval attachment (EC50) after 24 h ranged from 0.10- 0.27 mM. The data suggest that diketopiperazines and other compounds from deep-sea bacteria may be used as novel antifoulants.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial biofilm can cause nosocomial recurrent infections and implanted device secondary infections in patients and strongly promotes development of pathogenic drug resistance in clinical treatments. Butenolide is an effective anti-macrofouling compound derived from a marine Streptomyces sp., but its antibiofilm efficacy remains largely unexplored. In the present study, the antibiofilm activities of butenolide were examined using biofilms formed by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic model species. Four Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were used as targets in antibiofilm assays that examined the effects of butenolide, including the following: (i) on bacterial growth; (ii) in inhibiting biofilm formation and eradicating mature biofilm; (iii) on biofilm structures. In addition, the synergistic effect between butenolide with tetracycline was also examined. Butenolide not only effectively inhibited the biofilm formation but also eradicated pre-formed biofilms of tested bacteria. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) indicated that butenolide was a potential tetracycline enhancer against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA. These results indicated that butenolide may hold a great potential as an effective antibiofilm agent to control and prevent biofilm-associated infections in future clinical treatments.",

        "abstract": "Marine organisms in intertidal zones are subjected to periodical fluctuations and wave activities. To understand how microbes in intertidal biofilms adapt to the stresses, the microbial metagenomes of biofilms from intertidal and subtidal zones were compared. The genes responsible for resistance to metal ion and oxidative stresses were enriched in both 6-day and 12-day intertidal biofilms, including genes associated with secondary metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, signal transduction and extracellular polymeric substance metabolism. In addition, these genes were more enriched in 12-day than 6-day intertidal biofilms. We hypothesize that a complex signaling network is used for stress tolerance and propose a model illustrating the relationships between these functions and environmental metal ion concentrations and oxidative stresses. These findings show that bacteria use diverse mechanisms to adapt to intertidal zones and indicate that the community structures of intertidal biofilms are modulated by metal ion and oxidative stresses.",

Here we provide further evidence of their nanomolar inhibitory activity against the human calpain 1 protease. Analysis of structure-activity relationship data supported our hypothesis that the rigid 12-membered ring containing an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl moiety is the pharmacologically active functional group, in contrast to classic electrophilic \"warheads\" in known calpain inhibitors. Using a combination of chemical modifications, mass spectrometric techniques, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular modeling, we show the covalent binding of thalassospiramide's \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl moiety to the thiol group of calpain's catalytic Cys115 residue by a Michael 1,4-addition reaction. As nanomolar calpain inhibitors with promising selectivity and low toxicity from natural sources are rare, we consider thalassospiramides as promising drug leads.",

Five structurally similar compounds were isolated from the crude extract of a marine Streptomyces strain obtained from deep-sea sediments. Antifouling activities of these five compounds and four other structurally-related compounds isolated from a North Sea Streptomyces strain against major fouling organisms were compared to probe structure-activity relationships of compounds. The functional moiety responsible for antifouling activity lies in the 2-furanone ring and that the lipophilicity of compounds substantially affects their antifouling activities. Based on these findings, a compound with a straight alkyl side-chain was synthesized and proved itself as a very effective non-toxic, anti-larval settlement agent against three major fouling organisms. The strong antifouling activity, relatively low toxicity, and simple structures of these compounds make them promising candidates for new antifouling additives.",

The anti-bacterial-growth activity of crude extracts of each bacterium was evaluated by the disk-diffusion assay. Extracts of four potent bacteria with high and broad spectra of antibacterial activity were further separated with solvents of different polarities (hexane and ethyl acetate). To evaluate their indirect inhibitive effect on larval settlement, we tested for their antibiofilm formation activity against two of the test bacteria (Vibrio halioticoli and Loktanella hongkongensis) inductive to Hydroides elegans larval settlement. About 60 and 87% of the extracts inhibited biofilm formation by V. halioticoli and by L. hongkongensis respectively. The extracts were also tested for their direct antilarval-settlement activity against the barnacle Balanus amphitrite and the polychaete H. elegans; 87% of the extracts had a strong inhibitive effect on larval settlement of both species. Extracts of two of the isolates completely inhibited larval settlement of B. amphitrite at 70 microg ml(-1) and H. elegans at 60 microg ml(-1). The organic extracts of Winogradskyella poriferorum effectively inhibited the larval settlement of both H. elegans and B. amphitrite and the biofilm formation of the two bacterial species. The metabolites present in the active crude extracts were profiled using GC MS, and the most prevalent metabolites present in all extracts were identified. This study successfully identified potential new sources of antifouling compounds.",

        "abstract": "The anti-neoplastic agent didemnin B from the Caribbean tunicate Trididemnum solidum was the first marine drug to be clinically tested in humans. Because of its limited supply and its complex cyclic depsipeptide structure, considerable challenges were encountered during didemnin B's development that continue to limit aplidine (dehydrodidemnin B), which is currently being evaluated in numerous clinical trials. Herein we show that the didemnins are bacterial products produced by the marine \u03b1-proteobacteria Tistrella mobilis and Tistrella bauzanensis via a unique post-assembly line maturation process. Complete genome sequence analysis of the 6,513,401 bp T. mobilis strain KA081020-065 with its five circular replicons revealed the putative didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster (did) on the 1,126,962 bp megaplasmid pTM3. The did locus encodes a 13-module hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase enzyme complex organized in a collinear arrangement for the synthesis of the fatty acylglutamine ester derivatives didemnins X and Y rather than didemnin B as first anticipated. Imaging mass spectrometry of T. mobilis bacterial colonies captured the time-dependent extracellular conversion of the didemnin X and Y precursors to didemnin B, in support of an unusual post-synthetase activation mechanism. Significantly, the discovery of the didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster may provide a long-term solution to the supply problem that presently hinders this group of marine natural products and pave the way for the genetic engineering of new didemnin congeners.",

        "abstract": "The barnacle Balanus (\u200a=\u200aAmphibalanus) amphitrite is a major marine fouling animal. Understanding the molecular mechanism of larval settlement in this species is critical for anti-fouling research. In this study, we cloned one isoform of p38 MAPK (Bar-p38 MAPK) from this species, which shares the significant characteristic of containing a TGY motif with other species such as yeast, Drosophila and humans. The activation of p38 MAPK was detected by an antibody that recognizes the conserved dual phosphorylation sites of TGY. The results showed that phospho-p38 MAPK (pp38 MAPK) was more highly expressed at the cyprid stage, particularly in aged cyprids, in comparison to other stages, including the nauplius and juvenile stages. Immunostaining showed that Bar-p38 MAPK and pp38 MAPK were mainly located at the cyprid antennules, and especially the third and fourth segments, which are responsible for substratum exploration during settlement. The expression and localization patterns of Bar-p38 MAPK suggest its involvement in larval settlement. This postulation was also supported by the larval settlement bioassay with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Behavioral analysis by live imaging revealed that the larvae were still capable of exploring the surface of the substratum after SB203580 treatment. This shows that the effect of p38 MAPK on larval settlement might be by regulating the secretion of permanent proteinaceous substances. Furthermore, the level of pp38 MAPK dramatically decreased after full settlement, suggesting that Bar-p38 MAPK maybe plays a role in larval settlement rather than metamorphosis. Finally, we found that Bar-p38 MAPK was highly activated when larvae confronted extracts of adult barnacle containing settlement cues, whereas larvae pre-treated with SB203580 failed to respond to the crude adult extracts.",

        "abstract": "A Gram-stain-negative, non-flagellated, short rod-shaped bacterium, designated XY-R6, was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of a mangrove plant, Kandelia candel (L.) Druce, in Mai Po Nature Reserve, Hong Kong. Growth of strain XY-R6 was observed at pH 5.0-9.5 (optimum 6.5-8.0), between 8 and 42\u2009\u00b0C (optimum 28-34\u2009\u00b0C), and in the presence of 0-9.5\u200a% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1-4\u200a%). The predominant isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-10. The major fatty acids were summed feature 8 (C18\u200a:\u200a1\u03c96c and/or C18\u200a:\u200a1\u03c97c) (55.61\u200a%), C19\u200a:\u200a0cyclo\u03c98c (21.59\u200a%) and C16\u200a:\u200a0 (11.24\u200a%). The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, aminolipid, phosphatidylcholine and diphosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G+C\u2009content of strain XY-R6 was 69.3\u2009mol%. Phylogenetic analyses, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, revealed that strain XY-R6 belonged to the family Rhodobacteraceae of the class Alphaproteobacteria and formed a distinct lineage, showing the highest gene sequence similarities to the members of genus Wenxinia(94.5-94.3\u200a%), followed by the genera Profundibacterium (94.3\u200a%), Defluviimonas(93.8-92.5\u200a%), Oceanicola (93.8\u200a%) and Cereibacter (93.7\u200a%). Similarities to other genera within the family Rhodobacteraceae were below 94.0\u200a%. Based on comprehensive phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic characterization, it is indicated that strain XY-R6 represents a novel species of a new genus in the family Rhodobacteraceae, for which the name Kandeliimicrobium roseum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed, with XY-R6 (=MCCC 1K01498=KCTC 52266=DSM 104294) as the type strain.",

        "abstract": "Colibactin is a potent genotoxin that induces DNA double-strand breaks; it is produced by Escherichia coli strains harboring a pks+ island. However, the structure of this compound remains elusive. Here, using transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning to perform heterologous expression, we took advantage of the significantly increased yield of colibactin pathway-related compounds to determine and isolate a series of vital (pre)colibactin intermediates. The chemical structures of compounds 8, 10 and 11 were identified by NMR and MSn analyses. The new 1H-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyridine-3,6(2H,5H)-dione- and thiazole-containing compound 10 provides new insights regarding the biosynthetic pathway to (pre)colibactin and establishes foundations for future investigation of the intriguing (pre)colibactin structures and its modes of action.",

All diindol-3-ylmethanes (DIMs) showed moderate to strong inhibitory effects against larval settlement of B. amphitrite with EC50 values ranging from 18.57 to 1.86 mu M and could be considered as low-toxicity antifouling compounds since their LC50/EC50 ratios were larger than 15. Furthermore, the DIM- and 4-(di(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl)phenol (DIM-Ph-4-OH)-treated larvae completed normal settlement when they were transferred to clean seawater after being exposed to those compounds for 24 h. DIM also showed comparable antifouling performance to the commercial antifouling biocide Sea-Nine 211 (TM) in the field test over a period of 5 months, which further confirmed that DIMs can be considered as promising candidates of environmentally friendly antifouling compounds.",

        "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a universal signaling molecule and plays a negative role in the metamorphosis of many biphasic organisms. Recently, the NO/cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) signaling pathway was reported to repress larval settlement in the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we analyzed changes in the proteome of A. amphitrite cyprids in response to different concentrations of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 62.5, 250, and 1000 mu M) using a label-free proteomics method. Compared with the control, the expression of 106 proteins differed in all three treatments. These differentially expressed proteins were assigned to 13 pathways based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. SNP treatment stimulated the expression of heat shock proteins and arginine kinase, which are functionally related to NO synthases, increased the expression levels of glutathione transferases for detoxification, and activated the iron-mediated fatty acid degradation pathway and the citrate cycle through ferritin. Moreover, NO repressed the level of myosins and cuticular proteins, which indicated that NO might inhibit larval settlement in A. amphitrite by modulating the process of muscle locomotion and molting.",

Among them, 40 proteins were categorized into 11 functional groups based on KOG database, and the remaining 12 proteins were unknown. Besides the known proteins in barnacle shell (SIPC, carbonic anhydrase and acidic acid matrix protein), we also identified chorion peroxidase, C-type lectin-like domains, serine proteases and proteinase inhibitor proteins in the A. Amphitrite shell. The sequences of these proteins were characterized and their potential functions were discussed. Histology and DAPI staining revealed living cells in the shell, which might secrete the shell proteins identified in this study.",

To clarify the underlying molecular mechanism, we applied label-free proteomics to analyze changes in the proteome of cyprids treated with a p38 MAPK inhibitor. The results showed that the expression levels of 80 proteins were significantly modified (p u003c 0.05). These differentially expressed proteins were assigned to 15 functional groups according to the KOG database and 9 pathways were significantly enriched. Further analysis revealed that p38 MAPK might regulate the energy supply and metamorphosis. Two potential regulatory proteins, CUB-serine protease and PKA alpha, were both down-regulated in expression. CUB-serine protease localized to postaxial seta 2 and 3, as well as the 4 subterminal sensilla in the antennule. Importantly, it was co-localized with the neuron transmitter serotonin in the sections, suggesting that the CUB-serine protease was present in the neural system. PKA alpha was highly expressed during the cyprid and juvenile stages, and it was co-localized with phospho-p38 MAPK (pp38 MAPK) to the cement gland, suggesting that PKA alpha might have some functions in cement glands. Overall, p38 MAPK might regulate multiple functions in A. amphitrite cyprids, including the energy supply, metamorphosis, neural system and cement glands.",

The aromatic polymer structure of petroleum coke was approximate to that of anthracite, and the combustion performance of petroleum coke could be improved by vesicular structure. Added with petroleum coke, the ignition point of anthracite dropped from 527\u00b0C to 482.6\u00b0C, and its total mass fraction changed from 71.95% to 76.82%. The results show that the burning rate of anthracite can be raised by adding petroleum coke.",

        "abstract": "In order to measure the wet gas not separating, a wet gas measuring method based on double differential pressures of an alone venturi meter is presented in this study. In traditional over-reading (viz. OR) correlations, only the liquid phase fraction is known, can the OR be solved. This deficiency is analyzed by error propagation method theoretically. The change characteristics and the inherent physics laws of the differential pressures of the contraction and expansion sections of a venturi tube which were affected by the relative amount of liquid phase and gas flow rates were investigated deeply. Using a new dimensionless metering parameter, viz. the differential pressures ratio of contraction and expansion sections of venturi tube, a novel form of the OR correlation was, therefore, developed to improve the metering accuracy effectively. The gas and liquid flowrates of wet gas were solved respectively by iterations. Taking a prototype with DN80 diameter of 0.38 beta ratio designed and made for example, with the experimental devices of the wet gas flow measurement, the experimental research and the performance verification of the prototype was carried out in the flow laboratory of TianJin University. The experimental results show that the relative error of gas flow rates is less than \u00b12%, and the full scale error of liquid flow rates is less than \u00b110%, under the condition like the test pressure range from 0.1\u223c0.16MPa, Froude number range from 0.4\u223c0.7, mass ratio of liquid and gas range from 0\u223c1.

This approach was based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) discrete phase model (DPM). The beta ratio of the standard Venturi tube was 0.55 and the inside diameter was 15.24 cm. Simulated fluid medium was nitrogen and kerosene, and the inlet pressures were 2 MPa, 4 MPa and 6 MPa, which corresponded to the gas flow rate of 400 m 3/h, 600 m 3/h, 800 m 3/h and 1000 m 3/h, respectively, and liquid flow rate was between 0 m 3/h and 65.11 m 3/h. The results of simulation predicted overreadings caused by wetness were verified by the experimental results of NEL (National Engineering Laboratory) in UK. The maximal relative error of overreading was 5.14%, and the average relative error was less than 2.8%. By comparing the TJU-CFD model with the other classical overreading models on the predicted gas flow rates, the simulation model presented in this paper ranked No.2, No.4 and No.3, respectively, under three individual pressures. The maximal relative error was 7.5%, and the average error was 2.5%.",

By revealing the distribution information of velocity field and pressure via numerical simulation, we forecast the influence of the upstream elbow and straight pipe length on the discharge coefficient of the cone flowmeter, and verify the results with experiment. The mediums of simulation and experiment are water with normal temperature, and the Reynolds numbers of the water are 0.498\u00d7105~4.98\u00d7105 and 0.14\u00d7105~5.1\u00d7105, respectively. There are two types of experiments namely, the baseline and elbow experiments, and the former one is used as the reference. The equivalent diameter ratios of the cone flowmeter are 0.45/0.65/0.85 respectively. Using the relative error and additive uncertainty of the averaged discharge coefficient as the main evaluating criterions, we obtain the length of the straight pipe for the upstream single 90\u00b0 elbow, and compare the result with that of foreign study.",

The experimental study and theoretical analysis show that the friction pressure loss due to the acceleration effect of gas to liquid is a major reason behind the over-reading, under the same flow conditions, the over-reading tends to increase with smaller hydraulic diameter of the throttling device and more homogeneous mixed gas and liquid.

        "abstract": "In order to acquire a deep knowledge of the pressure loss performance and obtain high accuracy pressure loss calculation formula of V-cone flowmeter, experiment investigation has been carried out, which is about the effects of key factors on the pressure loss of cone flowmeter. A set of prototypes are designed and manufactured, viz. a V-cone flowmeter of 100 mm interior diameter with equivalent diameter beta ratio of 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, and 0.85 respectively. The experiment medium is water of normal temperature with Reynolds range of 0.14 \u00d7 105~4.2 \u00d7 105. The test data are analyzed from two different aspects, the permanent pressure loss and relative pressure loss. On one hand, the test results show that for V-cone flowmeter the permanent pressure loss increases along with the decrease of equivalent diameter beta ratio on the condition of the same Reynolds number; and increases with the increase of Reynolds number on the condition of the same equivalent diameter beta ratio. On the other hand, the experimental results prove that the relative pressure loss increases along with the decrease of beta ratio and is independent of Reynolds number. Compared with the results from foreign research institutes, the maximum deviation of the relative pressure loss in our study is approximately 21%. Compared with the curves of the relative pressure loss of other flowmeters studied abroad, the obtained curves of the beta ratio and relative pressure loss fall in between the two curves of orifice and nozzle, and are closer to the curves of orifice.",

The turbulence model was RNG \u03ba-\u03b5. There are 27 tested prototypes. And the medium for simulation and physical experiment is air at normal pressure and temperature. The simulation results show that equivalent diameter ratio has decisive influence on the air discharge coefficient of V-cone flowmeter; the fore cone angle has strong influence on it, while the aft cone moderate; the air discharge coefficient approaches a constant with the increase of Reynolds number. In order to further verify the computational conclusion, a special device for calibration was set up. The results show that the deviation of simulation is 2%-7%.",

Considering the overreading performance of Wafer-cone and Venturi, an overreading model for high accuracy cone differential pressure device based on Lockhart-Martinelli parameter, Froude number, density ratio of gas and liquid is put forward. A modified Deleeuw overreading model for Venturi differential pressure device was built, in which the polynomial representation of \"n\" value is given. Through comparing the metering accuracies of gas flow rates and liquid flow rates of cone flow meter and Venturi flow meter, respectively, a wet gas metering iteration algorithm for gas and liquid flow rates is obtained. Experiment results show that the mean relative error of gas flow rates is less than \u00b11% and full scale error of liquid flow rates is less than \u00b110% under the condition that the test pressure range is 0.1 MPa to 0.2 MPa , Froude number range is 0.6 to 1.5, L-M number range is 0.002 to 0.12, and gas mass rate range is 30% to 99%.",

With the gas flow calibration system based on the critical flow nozzles and positive pressure method, the experimental research has been carried out and a calculation formula has been obtained after deducing the fitting model of expansibility factor of cone flowmeters theoretically. Comparing with standard orifice, venturi, and three formulas for the cone flowmeters achieved from research organization abroad, the prediction curves and relatively error curves of the expansibility factor with different equivalent diameter ratios have been depicted.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the research of wet gas, the pressure drop is an important parameter in the design of the pipelines and the selection of the wet gas flow meters. Although an algorithm is described in the ISO11583 technical report that used to predict pressure loss ratio (PLR), the exploration of this method still need to be studied under the different flow conditions. A new correlation of pressure drop is proposed based on the important influence factors. Dimensional analysis is adopted to find the significant dimensionless parameters to establish the correlation of PLR, such as Lockhart\u2013Martinelli parameter and gas Froude number. The experiment of the Venturi tube has been carried out in the wet gas flow loop of Tianjin University. In the test, the static pressure of pipe ranged from 0.2 to 1.2\u00a0MPa and the superficial gas velocity ranged from 5 to 10\u00a0m/s. Results implied that the correlation of ISO11583 gave an unsatisfactory prediction of PLR. In order to improve the accuracy, the new correlation in this work was based on the dimensional analysis and experimental data. Finally, the average relative error of this correlation is about 3.85% and the root mean square error is about 2.5%.",

        "abstract": "Based on a higher raster angular displacement sensor, a fully-automatic higher precise apparatus for angular calibration is described. By using a higher resolution stepping motor, both of the two types of sensors, the standard raster sensor and the corrected sensor which are fixed in the same axial, can rotate coaxially at the same step. Meanwhile, the related software application platform is developed, which is being used for angular calibration and angular detecting. The output signals from the standard and corrected sensors can be transmitted to a host computer via one COM port. Take a kind of smart angular displacement sensor for calibration example, its angular displacement mathematic model embedded in MCU can be corrected by using this apparatus with higher accuracy so that the technique specification, like basic errors and linearity error can be improved greatly. For the four capacitive angular displacement sensors, their calibrating results sensors show that the averaged basic errors are 0.19%, 0.16%, 0.12% 0.15% respectively and the maximum is 0.62%, and the averaged linearity errors are 0.15% 0.12% 0.10% 0.14% respectively, and the maximum is 0.58% The accuracy of 1.0 level of this capacitive angular displacement sensor can be obtained.",

The energy in the range of 0 to 160 Hz is weak and distributed uniformly. As regards millisecond blasting, corresponding to particle vibration, the vibration energy mainly concentrates in two time periods: 0.25 s to 0.31 s and 0.35 s to 0.4 s, and there appear four instantaneous peaks, among them the largest instantaneous energy is caused by charge of caving holes.

The model of blasting damage recently developed can reflect the physical course of rock blasting objectively, but the model parameters of blasting damage is very difficult to select, and numerical calculation is needed to determine the range of blasting damage, so it is very inconvenient to use. In practice, the range of blasting damage is confirmed by Sach's safety criterion, peak particle vibration velocity safety criterion and other criterions, however, they are all semi-empirical with man-made error of selecting peak particle vibration velocity. Based on the analysis of empirical criterions and the attenuation rule of blasting stress wave, the range of blasting damage equation to calculate the blast-induced damage zone is deduced and the initial stress of rock is considered. The range of rock damage can be predicted conveniently by knowing the tensile strength and Poisson's ratio to coincide with practice better. Finally the method of damage calculation is adopted to compute the practice case of a project, and the results show that it is reasonable. The process of operation is convenient, and is worth of spreading in project.",

Firstly the planar continuum is subdivided into the planar rectangular element with 5 nodes and 15 degrees of freedom, and then the rectangular element is transformed into the cross-frame element, thus replacing the planar continuum by the planar frame. Nodal force in the cross-frame element under loading is calculated. By means of virtual force method, the cross-section deformation of the beam is calculated, and then the new nodal force is calculated by using the deformation in the cross-frame element. By superposing the nodal forces of the same cross-frame element, nodal force in the planar rectangular element is obtained.

First of all, the blasting vibration velocity, the blast damage depth, and the radius are forecasted according to the data measured by SVM regression method of the Three Gorges Project area. And then the motion peak velocity, vibration frequency, time duration, and the area under the time-energy density curve are used as the evaluation indexes. Considering the magnitude of the signal intensity of blasting vibration, spectral characteristics, time duration characteristics and time-energy density curve characteristics, we establish the SVM classification model to forecast the damage effect of rock mass blast and vibration with 11 group of rock mass blasting measured data as the training samples and 8 group to distinguish. The results show that the SVM classification and regression model works well in predicting the effects of rock blasting, and the results are coincided with the actual ones, which provides a new approach to the evaluation of the rock blasting effect and can be applied in practical engineering.",

The tests results showed that only the attenuation creep can exist under low stress,and the instable creep appears when the stress exceeds the rheological long-term strength. At the same time,with the temperature reducing,the instantaneous strain and creep deformation of soft rock decrease apparently,while there is a substantial increase of the long-term strength. It shows that the influence of temperature on the rheological property of soft rock and frozen wall is very significant. Nonlinear viscosity coefficient related to the time and stress and the time switching function were introduced to improve the Nishihara model,and the nonlinear rheological constitutive model which describes accelerating creep was obtained. The parameters of frozen red-bed soft rock were identified by the tests data. Shaft excavation was simulated with introduction of the model into ABAQUS finite element program,and the curve of maximum displacement of frozen wall with time was obtained. At last the comparison between the numerical solution and the measured value was conducted and the results are consistent relatively. The rheological constitutive model can establish a good description of the creep law of red-bed soft rock.",

For the creep,the integer order calculus constitutive relation of artificial frozen soil needs too many components and has other disadvantages,replaced the serial mode of Burgers model with fractional oder derivative function model,fractional order derivative Burgers creep model was constructed to simulate the steady stage of creep. Connected acceleration element in the fractional order derivative Burgers model,the fractional order derivative acceleration Burger creep model to simulate the acceleration stage of creep was constructed.

It is pointed out that while the stress wave has effect on the primary micro crack, the crack will be started and developed by the tangential tension stress around the crack. The condition for stopping the complex crack I-II at the damage state is defined. Meanwhile by the condition for stopping crack, the minimum distance for the I and I-II cracks from the blasting center is deduced. It is very useful to the theoretical research. The formula for expansion length of the crack in the medium long zone is derived.

The effects of confining pressure, the principal stress axis rotation angle and the static deviator stress on cycle cumulative pore pressure were obtained. On the basis of the cumulative pore pressure of the first cyclic loading and the revised dynamic deviatoric stress level, an explicit model was proposed to calculate the cumulative pore pressure of saturated clay subjected to cyclic loading.

The elastase and cell partition behavior in polyethylene glycol (PEG)/salt systems was investigated. The suitable system for elastase extraction was PEG/KH(2)PO(4)-K(2)HPO(4), in which elastase is mainly partitioned into the PEG-rich phase, while the cells remained in the other phase. The influence of defined system parameters (e.g. PEG molecular mass, pH, NaCl addition) on the partitioning behavior of elastase is described. The concentration of phase forming components, PEG and KH(2)PO(4)-K(2)HPO(4), was optimized for elastase recovery by means of response surface methodology, and it was found that they greatly influenced extraction recovery. The optimal ATPS was 23.1% (w/w) PEG 2 000 and 11.7% (w/w) KH(2)PO(4)-K(2)HPO(4). The predicted recovery was about 89.5%, so this process is suggested to be a rapid and convenient method for elastase extraction.",

Thus, the aim of the current study was to verify whether Achyranthes bidentata extract (ABE) can be used to prevent steroid-induced ONFH and to investigate its underlying pharmacological mechanisms.Steroid-induced ONFH rat models were established to evaluate the effects of ABE treatment on osteonecrotic changes and repair processes. Microfocal computed tomography (Micro-CT) was performed to assess the effects of ABE treatment on bone mass, microstructure, and vascularization. Then, the effects of ABE treatment on osteoclast differentiation and bone formation were also evaluated in vivo and in vitro. In addition, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression in sera, femoral heads and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were detected at both protein and mRNA levels.The ratio of empty lacuna, adipose tissue area, and adipocyte perimeter in the bone marrow were markedly lower in the ABE treatment groups than in the model group. Micro-CT evaluation indicated that ABE treatment could improve the microstructure of the trabecular bone, increase bone mineral density and promote vascularization in steroid-induced ONFH rats. Moreover, ABE treatment inhibited osteoclast differentiation and activated bone formation markers. Interestingly, OPG downregulation, RANK and RANKL upregulation, and an increased ratio of RANKL to OPG in sera and necrotic femoral head could be reversed by ABE treatment, which also effectively inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and regulated RANKL and OPG expression of in vitro.ABE may prevent steroid-induced ONFH and alleviate steroid-induced bone deterioration by regulating the RANKL/RANK/OPG signaling pathway.",

However, the exact role that SOX9 plays in HCC remains unclear. In this study, we firstly confirmed that miRNA-101 directly targets SOX9 in HCC. Ectopic expression of miR-101 significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation and tumorigenicity by targeting SOX9. Moreover, the down-regulation of miR-101 in clinical HCC tissues correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Therefore, miR-101 may suppress HCC tumor progression by down-regulating SOX9. MiR-101 may be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC.",

        "abstract": "Wu-tou decoction (WTD) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine formula and has been used effectively to treat joint diseases clinically. Previous reports indicated that WTD possesses anti-inflammatory activity; however, its actions on pain have not been clarified. Here, we investigated the antinociceptive activity of WTD in CFA-induced mice, and its possible mechanism of the action associated with transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels was also explored. Our results showed that 1.58, 3.15, and 6.30\u2009g/kg WTD significantly attenuated mechanical, cold, and heat hypersensitivities. Moreover, WTD effectively inhibited spontaneous nociceptive responses to intraplantar injections of capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde, respectively. WTD also effectively suppressed jumping and wet-dog-shake behaviors to intraperitoneal injection of icilin. Additionally, WTD significantly reduced protein expression of TRPV1 and TRPA1 in dorsal root ganglia and skins of injured paw. Collectively, our data demonstrate firstly that WTD exerts antinociceptive activity in inflammatory conditions by attenuating mechanical, cold, and heat hypersensitivities. This antinociceptive effect may result in part from inhibiting the activities of TRPV1, TRPA1, and TRPM8, and the suppression of TRPV1 and TRPA1 protein by WTD was also highly effective. These findings suggest that WTD might be an attractive and suitable therapeutic agent for the management of chronic inflammatory pain.",

Their blood were collected to detect the hemoglobin in plasma, the content of serum bilirubin, the number of peripheral blood reticulocytes, the T-AOC in whole blood, measure the contents of glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) of RBC membrane, determine the activity of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-ATPase, fluidity, and observe its impact on the liquidity and deformability of RBCs. According to the electrical and biochemical experiment, the voltammetric behaviors of CR and berberine on glassy carbon electrode were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry. In the RBC in vitro experiment, the impact of Coptidis Rhizoma on autoxidation hemolysis rate of RBCs of normal mice was observed.There was no significant effect on hemoglobin, serum bilirubin, and reticulocyte count in normal mice administrated with CR at the dose of 1.2 g x kg(-1), and so is on RBC membrane SOD, G6PD, MDA, GSH and whole blood T-AOC activity. In addition, CR had also no significant effect on Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-ATPase activity, and no notable impact on the fluidity and deformability of RBCs. There were two oxidation peaks at -0.27 V and 0.60 V induced by CR and one oxidation peak induced by berberine at 0.56 V, with no reduction peak at fly-back. CR could significantly inhibit oxidative hemolysis in RBCs at the dose of 0.125-2 g x L(-1) in vitro.The normal dose of Coptidis Rhizoma can not cause hemolysis of RBC, and also can not change antioxidant system and functions of RBC, CR and berberine show antioxidant (reducing) properties.",

P-2 and P-2\u2032 were prepared by Wittig-Horner reaction of (R)-6,6\u2032-dibutyl-2,2\u2032-bisoctoxy-1,1\u2032-binaphthyl-3,3\u2032-dicarbaldehyde (R-M-2) with 5,5\u2032-bis (diethylphosphonomethyl)-2,2\u2032-bipyridine (M-2) in the presence of EtONa or NaH, respectively. P-3 was synthesized by Wittig-Horner reaction of (R)-6,6\u2032-di(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2,2\u2032-bisoctoxy-1,1\u2032-binaphthyl-3,3\u2032-dicarbaldehyde (R-M-3) with M-2 using NaH as a base. The four polymers have strong blue-green fluorescence due to the extended \u03c0-electronic structure between the chiral model compounds (R)-6,6\u2032-dibutyl-/di(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2,2\u2032-bisoctoxy-1,1\u2032-binaphthyl (R-1 or R-2) and the conjugated linker 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl group via vinylene bridge. Both monomers and polymers were analyzed by NMR, MS, FT-IR, UV-vis spectroscopy, DSC-TGA, fluorescence spectroscopy, GPC and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Based on the great differences of specific rotation values and CD spectra, P-1 and P-2 may adopt a zigzag chain configuration, while P-2\u2032 and P-3 may adopt a helical configuration. The responsive optical properties of the two chiral helical polymers P-2\u2032 and P-3 on transition metal ions were investigated by fluorescence, UV-vis and CD spectra. The results show that Ag + and Ni 2+ lead to nearly complete fluorescence quenching of P-2\u2032 and P-3, Cu 2+ and Fe 2+ can cause obvious fluorescence quenching, but Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ can only produce slight fluorescence quenching. Ag +, Ni 2+, Cu 2+ and Fe 2+ can also lead to the obvious changes of UV-vis spectra of P-2\u2032 and P-3. On the contrary, Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ cause little changes. Most importantly, the CD intensities and wavelengths of the chiral helical polymers P-2\u2032 and P-3 exhibit the pronounced changes upon addition of Ag + and Ni 2+. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with other cations, such as K+, Mg2+, Pb2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Ag+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ and Fe3+, Hg2+ can produce the pronounced fluorescence response of the polymer. The result indicates this kind of chiral polybinaphthyls incorporating diethylamino and benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (BT) moieties as receptors exhibits highly sensitive and selective behavior for Hg2+ detection.

The fluorescence response of two chiral polymers P-1 and P-2 on (R)- or (S)-phenylglycinol were investigated by fluorescence spectra. The fluorescence intensities of two chiral polymers P-1 and P-2 show gradual enhancement upon addition of (R)- or (S)-phenylglycinol and keeps nearly linear correlation with the concentration molar ratios of (R)- or (S)-phenylglycinol. But both P-1 and P-2 exhibited more sensitive response signals for (S)-phenylglycinol. The values of enantiomeric fluorescence difference ratio (ef) are 1.84 and 2.05 for P-1 and P-2, respectively. The results also showed that two chiral polymers P-1 and P-2 can also be used as fluorescence sensors for enantiomer composition determination of phenylglycinol. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "In order to investigate the influence of support structure properties on CO2 capture performances of solid amine adsorbent, a novel 3-dimensional disordered porous silica (3dd) with hierarchical pore networks was developed and then compared to other three materials as adsorbent support, namely, HPS (hierarchical porous silica), MCM-41 and SBA-15. They were functionalized with tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) to prepare CO2 adsorbents. CO2 capture process of adsorbents were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. When these supports with 60wt% TEPA loading, the CO2 capture amount follows the order: 3dd > HPS > SBA-15 > MCM-41 at 75 \u00b0C, their adsorption capacities are 5.09, 4.9, 4.58 and 2.49 mmol/g, respectively. The results indicate that the larger pore volume can promote the dispersion of amines species to expose more active sites for CO2 capture. The larger pore size can decrease the CO2 diffusion resistance. The high surface area is not an important factor in determining capture performance. In addition, compared with conventional single-size mesopores, the hierarchical pore networks can disperse the TEPA species into the different levels channel to limit undesired loss/aggregation of impregnated TEPA species. Thus, the 3dd support exhibits the best stability and highest regeneration conversion compared to the other three supports. This work demonstrates that the rational design of adsorbent support systems can effectively relieve the trade-off between amine loading and diffusion resistance. One method to surmount this trade-off is to utilize an adsorbent platform with hierarchical pore networks. Thus, this work may provide a feasible strategy for the design of CO solid amine adsorbents with high capture amount and amine utilization efficiency.",

A fixed bed reactor system with no carrier gas is used. For the products (tar, gas and semi-char) distribution determination, experiments are carried out over different operating factors. The characteristics of pyrolysates are analyzed with Gas Chromatograph (GC), Gas Chromatograph/Mass Selective Detector system (GC/MSD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm analysis and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The kinetic model of Coats\u2013Redfern is used, as a basis, to predict the experimental evolution curves. It is seen here that temperature, heating rate and particle size play a pivotal role in low temperature pyrolysates distribution. Meanwhile, it is suggested that atomic ratios of H/C and O/C have some correlativity with the yield of products. The prediction of Costs\u2013Redfern integral model is discussed with the experimental fractions, which indicates that the model is suitable to explain the reaction mechanism of lignite during low temperature pyrolysis.",

The results show that a higher pressure was conducive to the yield of H 2  and CH 4 , and was not conducive to the generation of CO. Combustible gas components increase with the increase temperature. H 2  concentration was affected significantly by temperature, was mainly released at higher temperatures (u003e500\u00a0\u00b0C). At 700\u00a0\u00b0C, the combustible gas components are up to 90% and H 2  concentration is up to 51.78%. The gas components of corn stalk pyrolysis char steam gasification mainly consisted of CO and H 2 , 25.7% and 50.7% respectively. The calorific value of gasification gas is up to 9508.9\u00a0kJ/M 3 . A kinetic study of the pyrolysis process of the corn stalk was investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer. As the heating rate increased, the activity energy reduced. By using the Popescu method to determine that shrinking core model can reflect the pyrolysis process of corn stalk truly at low temperature pyrolysis, and chemical reaction model can reflect the pyrolysis process of corn stalk truly at high temperature pyrolysis. Experimental results showed that values of kinetic parameters can be successfully used to understand the degradation mechanism of solid-state reaction.",

The results show that coke bed pressure drop increases with the increasing of the gas flow and decreases with the coke particle size increasing. When the gas flow is larger and the particle size of the coke is smaller, the coke bed pressure drops obvious change.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ca-promoted Co-based/AC catalysts prepared with various Ca/Co ratios by using impregnation method were applied to synthesis gas production via CO 2 -CH 4  reforming reaction. The influences of preparation methods on the physico-chemical characteristics, catalytic activities and stability of the catalysts were examined in a fixed-bed reactor. The basic physico-chemical characters of prepared catalysts were studied by the H 2 -TPR, XRD and XPS and BET methods. H 2 -TPR, XRD and XPS results confirmed that cobalt dispersion improving, the interaction between cobalt and calcium intensify and the sintering of cobalt mitigation is due to calcium addition. Results of XRD and H 2 -TPR also show that there was a new crystal substance Ca 3 Co 2 O 6  formed, which has most strong influence on the catalytic activity enhancing and the anti-coking ability of CO 2 -CH 4  reforming catalyst. Through the SEM analysis of the used catalyst after CO 2 -CH 4  reforming, the Co-Ca/AC catalysts were also confirmed to show better sinter-stability. In addition, the addition of calcium can improve the carbon dioxide adsorption properties, so that it is easy to eliminate carbon deposited on the surface of the catalyst by gasification. In particular, the catalyst with 14\u00a0wt.% of calcium addition revealed a good activity and anti-sintering ability in CO 2 -CH 4  reforming. On the basis of experimental observations and literature reviewed, a simple carbon dioxide reforming of methane into syngas mechanism over a cobalt/AC catalyst promoted by Ca is proposed.",

        "abstract": "In this article, a comparison will be made concerning the advantages and disadvantages of five kinds of coal mine methane (CMM) deoxygenation method, including pressure swing adsorption, combustion, membrane separation, non-metallic reduction, and cryogenic distillation. Pressure swing adsorption has a wide range of application and strong production capacity. To achieve this goal, adsorbent must have high selectivity, adsorption capacity, and adequate adsorption/desorption kinetics, remain stable after several adsorption/desorption cycles, and possess good thermal and mechanical stabilities. Catalytic combustion deoxygenation is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction, which releases large amounts of thermal energy. So, the stable and accurate control of the temperature is not easy. Meanwhile partial methane is lost. The key of catalytic combustion deoxygenation lies in the development of high-efficiency catalyst. Membrane separation has advantages of high separation efficiency and low energy consumption. However, there are many obstacles, including higher costs. Membrane materials have the requirements of both high permeability and high selectivity. The development of new membrane materials is a key for membrane separation. Cryogenic distillation has many excellence advantages, such as high purity production and high recovery. However, the energy consumption increases with decreasing CH4 concentrations in feed gas. Moreover, there are many types of operational security problems. And that several kinds of deoxygenation techniques mentioned above have an economic value just for oxygen-bearing CMM with methane content above 30%. Moreover, all the above methods are not applicable to deoxygenation of low concentration CMM. Non-metallic reduction method cannot only realize cyclic utilization of deoxidizer but also have no impurity gases generation. It also has a relatively low cost and low loss rate of methane, and the oxygen is removed thoroughly. In particular, the non-metallic reduction method has good development prospects for low concentration oxygen-bearing CMM. This article also points out the direction of future development of coal mine methane deoxygenation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A kind of hierarchical porous silica (HPS) was synthesized in a relatively mild condition and then devoted as the supports to fabricate TEPA-impregnated adsorbents for CO 2  adsorption. HPS has different pore size distribution and the huge pore volume. These structure characteristics of HPS can mitigate the mass transfer resistance which occurs more serious in traditional carrier materials with single smaller channel. The CO 2  adsorption performances of modified HPS were investigated in a homemade fixed bed reactor under different conditions. The HPS exhibited maximum CO 2  adsorption capacities of 5.01\u00a0mmol/g when 60\u00a0wt.% TEPA loaded. It presented better TEPA loading properties and higher CO 2  adsorption capacities than the majority of the single ordered mesoporous adsorbents according to the literature. When the adsorption experiments were repeated ten times, the amount of CO 2  capture reduces from 5.01\u00a0mmol/g to 4.7\u00a0mmol/g, only 6.1% reduction. And the deactivation model which can describe the absorption of CO 2  was adopted under different experiment conditions. In all these cases, the experimental data of CO 2  adsorption gave a good agreement with the predicted results by the breakthrough model.",

BET and SEM surface structure analysis indicated that after modification with potassium permanganate under alkaline condition, specific surface area of activated carbon increased, microspore and mesoporous capacities enlarged, but the pore diameter of activated carbon slightly reduced. XPS and FT-IR characterization indicated that after modification with potassium permanganate under alkaline condition, acid oxygen-containing functional groups dropped and new alkaline active substances like ionic OH \u2212  and manganite were generated on the activated carbon surface. Increased specific surface area and pore capacity of activated carbon, reduced acid oxygen-containing groups and generated alkaline active substances like ionic OH \u2212  and manganite exerted significant influences on methane activation and carbon dioxide reforming of methane. Under alkaline condition, the activity of the potassium permanganate modified activated carbon and reforming conversion slightly increased because of interaction between alkaline functional groups and acid carbon dioxide; In the meantime, newly generated ionic OH \u2212  on the surface and manganite participated in reforming reaction, which also improved activity of potassium permanganate-modified activated carbon for carbon dioxide reforming of methane. Under acid condition, CO 2 -CH 4  reforming conversion and catalyst activity decreased because of interaction between acidic functional groups and acid carbon dioxide.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Briquette binder plays a key role in the process of briquette production. The quality and performance of briquette also depend on the quality of briquette binder. Different types of briquette need different briquette binder. Binder used in briquetting process can be divided into inorganic binder, organic binder and compound binder. The inorganic binders have many excellent advantages, such as abundant resource, low cost, excellent thermos-ability and good hydrophilicity. However, a major problem arising from the usage of inorganic binder is related to the ash increased in significant amount. The organic binders have many excellent advantages, such as good bonding, good combustion performance and low ash. But organic binder is easy to decompose and burn when it was heated, so the mechanical strength and thermal stability of organic binder briquette are poor, and its price is high. The composite binders are composed of two binders at least; the different binder plays the different role. The compound binder can make full use of the advantages of all kinds of binder, such as it can reduce the supplying amount of inorganic binder, reduce the cost of organic binder, improve the quality of briquettes, and get better performance of briquettes. This review will cover briquette binder literature. Due to many factors taking into consideration for briquettes process, up to the present, no uniform mechanism has been developed to solve briquette production. The clarification of briquetting mechanism of briquette binder is not only can provide a theoretical basis for binder development, but also can provide instructive theory for briquette industrial production. There are five main theories of non-binder briquetting mechanisms: bituminous hypothesis, humic acid hypothesis, capillary hypothesis, colloid hypothesis and adhesion molecules hypothesis respectively. But those hypotheses cannot fully explain the briquetting issues about lignite. There are three main theories binder briquetting mechanisms from the view of interaction of binders and the pulverized coal: solid bridge connecting, electrostatic attraction and liquid bridge connecting respectively. In this paper, the process of non-binder briquetting mechanism and briquetting mechanism with binder is also reviewed.",

The adsorbents were characterized using BET, XRD, FTIR, TEM, TGA and  In situ  IR DRIFTs. Characterization results show that additional impregnated TEPA has a negative effect on the textural properties of adsorbents and additional impregnated TEPA has not change the channel structure of the adsorbent. It also is found that the synergistic effect of TEPA and P123 enhance the initial decomposition temperature and enhance the stability of adsorbent. Compared with SBA-15-60TEPA, SBA-15(p)-60TEPA (SP60T) has better reusability and cyclic performance. After 9 times cycle, the SP60T sorbent still adsorbs around 5.0\u00a0mmol/g of CO 2  from 20% CO 2  in N 2  at 75\u00a0\u00b0C and 1\u00a0atm, CO 2  adsorption capacity only reduces 7.8%. It is mainly because that the template in carrier makes TEPA evenly dispersed, effectively prevent the TEPA reunion and loss, and improve the utilization ratio of amine. According to adsorption dynamics and inactivation model, CO 2  adsorption of SP60T is mainly chemical adsorption. The  in situ  infrared spectroscopy reveals that CO 2  adsorption of SP60T follows anionic and cationic mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to relieve the amine agglomeration phenomenon in solid amine adsorbent and realize the efficient CO 2  capture, a novel double-functionalized adsorbent was synthesized by grafting 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and impregnating tetraethylenepentamine, using original mesoporous silica molecular sieves as support. The effects of organic amine loading, gas flow rate and adsorption temperature on CO 2  adsorption properties of adsorbent were studied. The results show that SBA-15(p)-AP-70T modified with 70% TEPA has the maximum N content (15.81\u202fmmol/g) and the maximum saturated adsorption capacity (5.69\u202fmmol/g) at 75\u202f\u00b0C \u3002 Moreover, the CO 2  adsorption capacity of this adsorbent can still remain about 5.2\u202fmmol/g after 15 adsorption/desorption cycles. It is mainly because that the grafted APTES and residual P123 in the support pore provide space and hydrogen bonding functional groups for TEPA dispersion and fixation, while reduce the loss of TEPA during the cycle process. Therefore, compared with adsorbent modified by only TEPA, the adsorption capacity and stability of this adsorbent can be effectively improved. In addition, kinetic studies indicate that CO2 adsorption on SBA-15(p)-AP-70T is mainly chemisorption. According to the in situ DRIFTS results, CO 2  adsorption mechanism on SBA-15(p)-AP-70T adsorbent is consistent with the zwitterion mechanism.",

The modified (Co/AC-N) and unmodified (Co/AC) catalyst were characterized by BET, H 2 -TPR, XRD, TEM, XPS, CO 2 -TPD and FTIR. It was found that the modified catalyst not only showed excellent stability, but also had better catalytic activity than the unmodified catalyst. Although the physical structure of modified catalysts is almost same with the unmodified catalysts, nitrogen and some oxygen functional groups such as pyridine nitrogen, pyrrole nitrogen, hydroxyl and oxygen incarbonyl groups were generated on the AC surface during the amination treatment. The generated surface nitrogen and oxygen functional groups affect not only influence the dispersion of active metals but affect the valence distributions of cobalt. Compared with the untreated catalyst, small active particle size with a narrow size distribution formed on the surface of N-doped catalyst. Moreover, the modified catalyst also provides more basic sites for the reforming reaction to accelerate the adsorption and dissociation of CO 2  on the active site of the catalyst.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In recent years, global warming issue has been a major environmental concern, so the treatment or utilization of the greenhouse gases CO 2  and CH 4  have become a matter of urgency. Given this realization, dry reforming of methane (DRM) provides a comprehensive utilization of methane and carbon dioxide, which has been investigated systematically. In CH 4  CO 2  reforming reaction, Ni-based catalysts are widely used and promisingly industrialized due to their outstanding features and low price compared with precious metals. In this paper, we emphasize the recent accomplishments in catalyst design for DRM reaction, particularly focusing on the influence of supports, promoters, and preparation methods on the DRM reaction with nickel-based catalysts. We also present a review on the catalytic mechanistic and kinetics of the DRM reaction. Furthermore, this review looks ahead the major challenges and opportunities of nickel-based catalysts in DRM reaction research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ordered mesoporous silica-carbon (MSC) were used as supports of Ni based catalysts for dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction. The effects of preparation method and precipitant on the catalysts are investigated. The physical and chemical properties are discussed based on the H 2 -TPR, FTIR, XRD, TEM, H 2 -TPD and N 2  adsorption/desorption characterization. It is found that the preparation method and choice of precipitants affect the catalysts significantly in terms of the properties and catalytic performance in DRM reaction. In detail, the catalysts prepared by the precipitation method show more highly dispersed Ni particles and further better catalytic activity than the impregnated catalyst. That is attributed to the forming Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4  nanoflakes in the catalyst precursors with the existence of alkaline precipitants. And this Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4  species bind the support more tightly than NiO in the impregnated Ni/MSC catalyst. Moreover, the choice of precipitants also influences the form of Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4  species in the catalysts. Specially, the strong electrolytic capacity of NaOH gives the most Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4  nanoflakes formed in Ni-MSC-1 catalyst, which results in the most highly Ni dispersity and further highest catalytic activity. Besides, the strong interaction between the Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4  species and support are also advantageous to the resist sintering and formation of carbon deposition, that is related to the good catalytic stability of catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The physicochemical properties of semi-char produced by the pyrolysis of binder cold-briquetted lignite (BCBL) in a fixed bed reactor at 600\u00a0\u00b0C under different atmospheres of CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , H 2 , and N 2  were investigated comprehensively. Using the N 2  BET method, the specific surface area of the different semi-chars were in the range of 1.71\u20132.53 (m 2 \u00a0g \u2212\u00a01 ), the pore volume and average pore diameter of the CO semi-char were lowest, and the N 2  semi-char values were highest. In contrast, the Dubinin CO 2  method at 0\u00a0\u00b0C gave specific surface areas of semi-chars in the range 165\u2013192 (m 2 \u00a0g \u2212\u00a01 ). The CO, N 2  and CH 4  semi-chars had the largest diameter, and the H 2  semi-char had the lowest diameter. The TGA test indicates the ignition temperature of BCBL was lower than different semi-chars. The FTIR spectra of BCBL and different semi-chars revealed that the removal rate of the oxygen-containing functional groups showed the highest efficiency under CO atmosphere, thus representing that CO could help to cleave the ether bond. The C1s, O1s, N1s, and S2p spectra of semi-chars under different atmospheres were analyzed by XPS. Raman analysis was also conducted to study the degree of structural orderliness in different semi-chars, which has great significance to the compressive mechanical strength of it. The semi-char produced in an atmosphere of CO 2  showed a more condensed crystalline structure and lowest compressive mechanical strength among all the semi-chars.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Dehydration of lignite primarily occurs in two stages, namely, removal of surface moisture and decrease in oxygen-containing functional groups and moisture stage. Moisture on the lignite surface could be removed at temperatures below 100\u00a0\u00b0C. However, parts of oxygen-containing functional groups were removed first followed by the removal of the adsorbed moisture at temperatures in the range 100\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C. Dehydration time increased with an increase in the dehydration load and heat transfer distance. At surface moisture of 7\u00a0wt.%, temperature of lignite increased rapidly. Higher temperature of combustion chamber yielded shorter removal times for surface moisture and oxygen-containing functional groups. Based on the rate of increase of lignite temperature and associated heat transfer process, coking chamber could be divided into three zones: the near, middle, and remote zones. The near zone temperature curve was determined to be a convex function         \u2202  2   T    \u2202   \u03c4  2     \u2264  0     ; however, the middle zone temperature curve was determined to be a concave function         \u2202  2   T    \u2202   \u03c4  2     \u2265  0    \u22c5     \u2202  2   T    \u2202   \u03c4  2     =  0    and      \u2202  T    \u2202  \u03c4    =  k    were the boundary indices of the middle and remote zones. 100\u00a0\u00b0C isothermal surface movement rate was found to be affected by the heat transfer capacity and dehydration load. Center temperature distribution of coking chamber was made uniform by steam, and temperature of HM 7%  was the most uniform distribution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Zhundong coal, which has high sodium content, induces severe fouling and slagging during its combustion in a boiler. Co-combustion is an effective method for mitigating these processes. In this study, oil shale is selected as an additive during combustion in order to study the properties of mixed fuel. The study results reveal that water-soluble sodium is the predominant component of Zhundong coal, which originates from the salt in seawater. With an increase in the oil shale blending ratio, the ash fusion temperatures of the mixed coal and the difference between softening temperature and deformation temperature first decrease and then increase. The maximum sodium retention of 86.01% occurs at a blending ratio of 10% and a final temperature of 815\u00a0\u00b0C. With an increase in temperature, aluminosilicates, such as albite and nepheline, form in the ash. Therefore sodium gradually migrates from the water-soluble phase to the aluminosilicate phase. With an increase in the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3  ratio, the ash fusion temperature of mixed coal decreases gradually, which is attributed to the effects of the SiO 2  and Al 2 O 3  contents on the melting point. Additionally, a mathematical model for sodium volatilization in the coal is constructed by MATLAB R2014a for fitting and optimization.",

The purpose of the present study was to explore, firstly, whether ozone induces oxidative preconditioning by activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and, secondly, whether ozone oxidative preconditioning (OzoneOP) can protect the heart against IRI by attenuating mitochondrial damage. Rats were subjected to 30min of cardiac ischemia followed by 2h of reperfusion, with or without prior OzoneOP (100\u03bcg/kg/day) for 5 days. Antioxidant capacity, myocardial apoptosis and mitochondrial damage were evaluated and compared at the end of reperfusion. OzoneOP was found to increase antioxidant capacity and to protect the myocardium against IRI by attenuating mitochondrial damage and myocardial apoptosis. The study suggests a potential role for OzoneOP in protecting the heart against IRI during cardiovascular surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass procedures or transplantation.",

        "abstract": "The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and heterogeneous endocrine disorder. MicroRNAs negatively regulate the expression of target genes at posttranscriptional level by binding to the 3' untranslated region of target genes. Our previous study showed that miR-141-3p was dramatically decreased in the ovaries of rat PCOS models. In this study, we aimed to characterize the target of miR-141-3p in rat ovarian granulosa cells. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay showed that cell viability was dramatically increased when miR-141-3p was overexpressed but was decreased when miR-141-3p was interfered. Flow cytometry showed that cell apoptotic rate was dramatically decreased when miR-141-3p was overexpressed but was increased when miR-141-3p was interfered. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) might be the target gene of miR-141-3p because the 3' untranslated region of DAPK1 contains sequences complementary to microRNA-141-3p. Transfection with miR-141-3p mimics and inhibitor into granulosa cells showed that both DAPK1 mRNA and protein levels were negatively correlated with miR-141-3p level. Dual-luciferase reporter assay established that DAPK1 was the target of miR-141-3p. Taken together, our data indicate that miR-141-3p may inhibit ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis via targeting DAPK1 and is involved in the etiology of PCOS.",

        "abstract": "Endometriosis is a common debilitating gynecologic disease. Almost 10% of reproductive-age women are affected by this disease; they commonly suffer pelvic pain and/or infertility. Early diagnosis of this multifactorial disease remains difficult because its etiology is not clear and the early symptoms are nonspecific. In addition, many reproductive-age women are unwilling to undergo invasive laparoscopic surgery because of the possibility of decreasing fertility. Thus, identifying biomarkers for the early diagnosis of endometriosis a key focus of current research. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of noncoding transcripts that have length of > 200 nucleotides and lack protein-coding ability but still influence gene expression in various ways. With advances in genome-wide analysis, researchers have determined that lncRNAs play an important role in many human diseases, particularly tumors. Moreover, the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of endometriosis has been continually recognized. In this review, we discuss the status of current research on dysregulated lncRNAs and their roles in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. We aim to stimulate new investigations toward the identification of lncRNAs as biomarkers for the early diagnosis and therapy of this long-term gynecological disease.",

Leydig cells in testicular interstitial tissues can secrete testosterone in a luteinizing hormone-dependent manner. We showed that BDNF and its receptor TrkB were expressed in mice TM3 Leydig cells in the present study. Furthermore, BDNF can promote proliferation of mouse TM3 Leydig cells in vitro. Results of microRNA (miRNA) deep sequencing showed that BDNF can alter the expression profile of miRNAs in TM3 Leydig cells. Eighty-three miRNAs were significantly different in the BDNF-treated and control groups (fold change of >2.0 or <0.5, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) wherein 40 were upregulated and 43 were downregulated. The expression levels of miR-125a-5p, miR-22-5p, miR-342-59, miR-451a, miR-148a-5p, miR-29b-3p, miR-199b-5p, and miR-145a-5p were further confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that miRNAs regulated a large number of genes with different functions. Pathway analysis indicated that miRNAs participate in the pathways involved in signal transduction, cancer, metabolism, endocrine system, immune system, and nerve system. This study indicated that miRNAs might be involved in the BDNF-regulated cellular functions of Leydig cells.",

        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in reproductive-aged women. However, the exact pathophysiology of PCOS remains largely unclear. We performed deep sequencing to investigate the mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles in the ovarian tissues of letrozole-induced PCOS rat model and control rats. A total of 2147 mRNAs and 158 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between the PCOS models and control. Gene ontology analysis indicated that differentially expressed mRNAs were associated with biological adhesion, reproduction, and metabolic process. Pathway analysis results indicated that these aberrantly expressed mRNAs were related to several specific signaling pathways, including insulin resistance, steroid hormone biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, cell adhesion molecules, autoimmune thyroid disease, and AMPK signaling pathway. The relative expression levels of mRNAs and lncRNAs were validated through qRT-PCR. LncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed to explore ceRNAs involved in the PCOS model and were also verified by qRTPCR experiment. These findings may provide insight into the pathogenesis of PCOS and clues to find key diagnostic and therapeutic roles of lncRNA in PCOS.",

It occurs in up to 1% of pregnancies after in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer. This article reports two rare cases of heterotopic pregnancy after in-vitro fertilization and presents a literature review. In the first case, a 28-year-old woman had previous laparoscopic bilateral total salpingectomy for a right tubal pregnancy and a left hydrosalpinx. However, she had ovarian heterotopic pregnancy after a third in-vitro fertilization cycle. An emergency laparotomy was performed. The synchronous intrauterine pregnancy continued with no further complications, and ended in the delivery of a singleton term pregnancy. The second case combined interstitial and intrauterine pregnancies after bilateral tubal ligation for hydrosalpinges followed by in-vitro fertilization and frozen embryo transfer. The possibility of heterotopic pregnancy following bilateral total salpingectomy/tubal ligation, though extremely rare, should also be considered by each gynecologist when they treat an IVF patient, even though an intrauterine pregnancy has been confirmed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) have inferior qualities compared with natural aggregates, mainly attributed to the porous nature of the attached cement mortar. To improve the quality of the RCAs, an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method is proposed to treat RCAs in this study. In this method, RCAs are first soaked in acetic acid solution, in which the acetic acid reacts with cement hydration products attached to the surface of the RCAs. This reaction weakens the attached mortar, making it possible to remove it from the RCAs by mechanical rubbing later. The treated RCAs have lower water absorption and less cement mortar attached. Once used as aggregates in new concrete, these RCAs can enhance the compressive strength of the concrete at 28\u00a0days up to 25%. It is safe and clean to apply this new method since no dangerous chemical is used and no detrimental chemicals are introduced into the treated RCAs. More importantly, zero hazardous waste solution is generated since the waste solution of the treatment can be used to produce high value-added products, permanently store CO 2 , and regenerate acetic acid. As an example, the waste solution of the treatment was used as admixture for new concrete, which improved the strength of the concrete by 14%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study proposes a low-cost method to convert cenospheres into an admixture carrier for concrete manufacturing. Cenospheres are hollow fly ash particles generated in coal burning power plants, having an aluminosilicate shell with high strength and stiffness. The large inner volume of the cenospheres can be used to carry and release admixtures in concrete. However, directly using cenospheres as the carrier is not possible because the inner pore is not accessible to the admixture. To address this problem, chemical etching is employed to produce perforating holes through the shell. Liquid admixtures can be easily loaded into and later released from the produced perforated cenospheres (PCs). A series of characterization tests were carried out to understand the working mechanism of the chemical etching method and its effect on the properties of the PCs. It has been found that chemical etching dissolved a small amount of amorphous materials from the cenosphere shell. As a result, the cenoshpere shell was weakened, as indicated by the reduction of the bulk crushing strength of the PCs. Nevertheless, the bulk crushing strength of all produced PCs are sufficient to guarantee that they can survive the mixing and initial stress in fresh concrete. To experimentally confirm the feasibility of using the PCs as an admixture carrier for concrete, PCs were added into cement mortar as the internal water carrier, which successfully mitigated the autogeneous shrinkage in a low water-to-cement ratio concrete. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the cement mortar confirms that PCs not only survived the mixing of concrete, but also were dispersed and bonded well to the cement mortar. This study suggests that PCs may provide a versatile tool to integrate various admixtures in concrete.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Mineral precipitation is a promising surface treatment method to enhance the mechanical properties and durability of concrete and similar porous materials. Both chemically and microbiologically induced mineral precipitations have been proposed, in which calcium carbonate is used as the precipitated mineral. Since calcium carbonate can be dissolved in low pH value solution, existing mineral precipitation method is vulnerable to acid attack. To overcome this drawback, this study proposes to use a new mineral, Hydroxyapatite (HAP) as the precipitate to treat concrete bricks. Compared with calcium carbonate, HAP has much lower solubility and dissolution rate and therefore much higher resistance to acid attack. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, low grade concrete bricks made from recycled aggregates were treated by the proposed method. Experimental study shows that up to 100% enhancement of the compressive strength of the concrete bricks can be achieved by this treatment. Meanwhile, the water absorption of the bricks is also significantly reduced. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were carried out to examine the mineralogy and morphology of the precipitates produced by the proposed treatment. Results suggest that all precipitates produced in this treating method eventually transform into HAP, and the transforming process can be accelerated by using treating solution with higher pH value.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A recent study showed that the properties of recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) can be significantly improved by acetic acid treatment. This study demonstrates that a useful product, vaterite, a metastable polymorph of calcium carbonate, can be produced from the waste solution of this treatment through an improved pH swing method. The salient feature of this improved method is that ethanol is added into the waste solution to not only prohibit the phase transformation of vaterite, but also to suppress the ionization of the regenerated acetic acid. This method allows not only more vaterite to be produced, but also more acetic acid to be regenerated from the waste solution through a CO 2  bubbling method. Meanwhile, CO 2  can be permanently stored in the produced vaterite to achieve sustainable CO 2  sequestration. Experimental results confirm that near-pure vaterite can be produced from the waste solution by adding 20% ethanol into the waste solution. 1\u00a0kg RCAs can be used to produce about 76.6\u00a0g vaterite and permanently store 33.7\u00a0g CO 2  by using this new method. The potential application of the produced vaterite as an internal curing agent for high performance concrete has also been demonstrated.",

This study proposes a novel chemical method to consolidate this mortar layer using phosphate solution. To this end, RCAs are immersed in diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP) solution. DAP can react with the calcium-rich hydration products in the RCA to produce hydroxyapatite (HAP) precipitate, which fills pores and seals cracks of the RCA, significantly improving the microstructure of the RCA.

This involves: a) adding an adequate amount of ammonia water to achieve maximum precipitation of Ca2+, b) refining CO2 bubble sizes into microns by a designed gas disperser, and c) using optimal final pH condition and CO2 flow rate to obtain vaterite with both high productivity and purity. In addition, the conservation of vaterite was also investigated by exposing vaterite to two moist environments. The results show that 95.1 % pure vaterite can be produced with 88.8 % yield at a final pH value of 8.6 and CO2 flow rate of 11 l min\u22121. The corresponding vaterite particles mostly have a hollow structure. The conservation of vaterite is very sensitive to moisture, and it transforms into calcite gradually depending on the moisture content.",

        "abstract": "Oilfield sludge is recognized as a hazardous solid waste in China because of its considerable hydrocarbon content and other toxic components. In this study, the nitrogen transformation during pyrolysis of typical oil sludge samples produced in the Daqing oilfield (the largest oilfield in China), was experimentally investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermos gravimetric (TG) were used in laboratory-scale experiments and batch pyrolysis experiments were conducted at 200-800\u202f\u00b0C in a tubular reactor to obtain quantitative information on the change of nitrogen conversion in the char, tar, and gas fractions. The thermal decomposition of amine-N compounds contributed to NH release below 250\u202f\u00b0C. However, the amine-N compounds in the char were converted to amine-N and imine-N compounds in the tar, and no obvious nitrogenous gases were found when the temperature increased from 250 to 500\u202f\u00b0C. Between 500 and 800\u202f\u00b0C, a large amount of NH and a small portion of HCN were found owing to the secondary cracking of tar and ring opening of heterocyclic-N compounds in the char. Therefore, NH, HCN, and NO emissions can be reduced by accurate control of the pyrolysis temperature. A temperature of 400\u202f\u00b0C was determined to be the optimal temperature for oilfield sludge pyrolysis, with 24.5% residual char and 43.0% tar produced. The results indicated that a suitable oilfield sludge pyrolysis temperature is helpful for reducing nitrogenous pollutant emissions, volume reduction, and energy recovery, which are beneficial for environmentally friendly production practices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   One of key challenges for reusing oilfield-produced water as boiler feedwater was desilication, which can produce large amounts of silica sludge and concentrated solutions causing serious secondary pollution. In this paper, an environmentally friendly method that oilfield-produced water is treated by advanced softening without desilication (AS) was conducted  via  a lab-scale test. Experimental results showed that average scaling rate of the AS was only 0.0018\u00a0g/l, which was only a third of that of traditional desilication (0.0056\u00a0g/l). Si content in scales formed by AS was less than that of traditional desilication, indicating that softening is more effective than desilication in controlling silicate scales. These suggested that more free silicates and silica can be taken away as volatile by saturated steam under the conditions of 285\u00a0\u00b0C and 7\u00a0MPa. However, these findings can offer an important reference for reusing the oilfield-produced water without desilication into boiler.",

        "abstract": "Reusing wastewater can enormously reduce environmental pollution and save water. One of the key obstacles to reuse is the scaling caused by calcium (Ca) ions and humic matter (HM). The interactions among HM, Ca ions and cation-exchange resins (CERs) during the water softening process were explored via lab-scale and pilot-scale tests. Surface topography, pore structure, and surface molecular structure of the CERs were determined using an atomic-force microscope, an automatic mercury porosimeter, a laser-Raman spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The surface charge of CERs was assessed by measuring zeta potential. Experimental results showed that HM can react with Ca-ions to form HM\u2013Ca+ and Ca ions can act as a bridge for HM and CER, suggesting that Ca ions and HM can be simultaneously removed by CERs. Kinetic analyses indicate that a pseudo-first order equation was able to accurately describe the overall adsorption kinetics and diffusion of Ca ions through a liquid film of CER was the rate-determining step for the overall adsorption process. Further investigation revealed that during the first 60 minutes of adsorption, the effect of HM on the CER adsorption kinetics can be described well by pseudo-first and pseudo-second order equations. This indicates that diffusions of Ca ions, HM, and HM\u2013Ca+ and their interactions were equivalent for controlling the initial stage of adsorption. In addition, 99% of Ca ions and 30\u201360% of HM in wastewater were removed in the pilot-scale test, suggesting that CERs have significant potential to remove Ca ions and HM simultaneously in wastewater.",

In this paper, the main constituents of sewage sludge (SS) and model sludge (MS) were reconsidered and a biochemical methane potential assay of sludge was conducted with the effect of different key chemical constituents. It was found that the humic matter, metal ions (such as Fe, Ca, and Al), silts were the main differences of constituents between SS and MS, and the interactions between them and easily biodegradable organic matter (EBOM) were the main factors for limiting the BP. Further research indicates that the apparent activated energy of sludge organic solubilisation could be used to suggest the strength of the interactions between non-biodegradable matter and EBOM, and the biodegradability of the EBOM in sludge particulate can be indicated by surface site density. This study can provide a new path for enhancing the BP per unit of organic matter and enlighten environmental scientists to develop more effective methods for improving the anaerobic sludge digestion.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Micron-sized silica particles (MSSP), ranging from 3 \u03bcm to 50 \u03bcm, have been widely found in the sewage sludge. The inhibition of MSSP to biogas conversion of both excess sludge (ES) and model sludge (MS) are explored in this study. It is observed that with the effect of MSSP, the net cumulative methane production (NCMP) of ES and MS were decreased by 23.5% and 22.3%, respectively, and the apparent activation energy (AAE) of organic solubilisation of ES and MS were increased by 38.7% and 215%, respectively, which implies a crucial role for MSSP in anaerobic sludge digestion. Analysis of physicochemical properties of sludges before and after interaction with MSSP reveals that MSSP can bond with organic matter from sludge on the surface sites to form a larger bioinorganic-floc. Further analysis indicates that MSSP can increase the AAE of sludge organic solubilisation by reducing the surface site density, thus resulting in poor NCMP. Through characterizing the bioinorganic-floc, it is found that the protein in sludge is the main component that bonds with MSSP. Further research show that the interactions between protein and MSSP are mainly enthalpy-driven with exothermic (the enthalpy was about\u00a0\u221210.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0kJ/mol, at 25\u00a0\u00b0C), indicating that protein is more stable after non-covalent bonding. These findings can provide a new understanding of the characteristics of sludge and important references for the improvement of anaerobic sludge digestion.",

As enzymes, the cornerstones of metabolism, are responsible for the efficiency of anaerobic digestion (AD) process, the adsorption of hydrolytic enzyme on the sludge with different surface site density (SSD) of SP was studied. The experimental results suggest that the surface site of SP can be considered as the binding site for hydrolytic enzyme, as confirmed by organic solubilisation tests of the sludge. To further explore the relationships between SSD and BCP of SS, the biochemical composition and long-term biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests of different sludge samples were conducted. The results show that both the methane production rate constant (k) and net cumulative methane production (NCMP) increased as the SSD values increased. Analyses of the statistical and fitting mathematical models for the SSD, biochemical composition, k, and NCMP revealed a significant positive linear correlation between k and NCMP versus SSD can be found (R 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.910, P\u00a0 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.939, P",

Notably, nitrite promoted volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation while FNA inhibited VFA accumulation in the first phase (acidogenic phase). In the second phase (methanogenic phase), neither nitrite nor FNA improved the net cumulative methane production from WAS. Although net cumulative methane production was not enhanced by the addition of nitrite or FNA, the volatile solids (VS) degradation rate was improved with nitrite addition in the two-phase anaerobic digestion process, indicating that nitrite is more favorable than FNA for the two-phase anaerobic digestion of WAS. It is expected that these findings can offer useful insights into future design of anaerobic digestion system with the treatment by the nitrite from digestion liquid.",

        "abstract": "Exploring moisture distribution plays an important role in improving sludge dewatering. However, the moisture content usually varies based on the measurements, and a comparison of various measurement methods for the same sample during the anaerobic digestion (AD) process is lacking. In this study, the moisture distributions of two types of sludge samples with different digestion times during the AD process are characterized by four methods (i.e., thermal drying, thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA), thermogravimetry differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC), low field H nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR)). The advantages and disadvantages of each test method are evaluated and discussed. It is found that, compared with the other three methods, LF-NMR has the advantages of high recovery rate and coincidence degree between total moisture content (TMC) and moisture content measurements. In addition, the moisture content in various occurrence states is compared. Experimental results show that the content of free moisture increases, while that of bound moisture decreases during the AD process, suggesting that bound moisture is converted into free moisture, which improves the sludge dewaterability. However, these findings can provide an important reference for characterizing the sludge moisture distribution and identifying the effect of the AD process on sludge dewatering.",

Coagulation\u2013flocculation with polyepicholorohydrin\u2013dimethylamine (EPI-DMA) and polymeric aluminum ferric chloride (PAFC) was used to optimize the treatment of OWPF. HPAM and COD removal were optimized using the response surface method (RSM), based on the Box\u2013Behnken design (BBD). The variables EPI-DMA dose, PAFC dose, and pH were selected as the factors in the RSM to investigate their individual and interaction effects on the response values, HPAM and COD removal efficiencies. The results showed that HPAM and COD removal efficiencies of 95.4 and 85.7%, respectively, could be reached using 0.65\u00a0mg/L EPI-DMA, 924\u00a0mg/L PAFC, and pH 5.51.

The results showed that after EDTA pretreatment (experimental group), the organic-bonding metals were reduced from (5.09\u00b10.57)% to (1.37\u00b10.20)% (calculated with TS) and dissolved organic matter increased significantly (SCOD improved 627%), suggesting that this method could remove a large amount of organic-bonding metals and enhance the dissolution of organic sludge. According to the results for the apparent activation energy (AAE) of sludge organic matter dissolution, the AAE of the experiment group was 36% lower than the control group, showing that pretreatment could effectively reduce the reaction energy barrier for organic matter dissolution. In a test of anaerobic acid production lasting 16 days, the VFAs of the experiment group were higher than the control group, with the largest upgrade of 42%. In the anaerobic methane production test (BMP) that lasted for 22 days, compared with control group, the accumulated biogas production of the experiment group increased by 48%. Through further research on the dynamics of methane production, the rate-limiting step in the experiment group was methanogenesis, while that of the control group was hydrolysis, indicating that removal of organic-bonding metals by EDTA pretreatment could effectively accelerate the hydrolysis rate.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Background  Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) can secrete bioactive amines into the bloodstream, causing carcinoid syndrome, with symptoms including flushing and diarrhoea. However, carcinoid syndrome frequency in the NET population has never been rigorously assessed, nor has its relationship to presenting clinicopathological characteristics. This analysis assessed the proportion of patients with NETs and carcinoid syndrome in the USA and associated clinical factors.  Methods  We identified patients (\u226565 years of age) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, excluding those with pancreatic tumours or small-cell or large-cell lung cancer, as well as those without complete data. We assessed the incidence of patients with at least two insurance claims of flushing, diarrhoea, or carcinoid syndrome during the 3 months before and after NET diagnosis. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with and without carcinoid syndrome using \u03c7 2  tests. We used the Cochran-Armitage trend test to identify trends in carcinoid syndrome incidence and Cox regression to assess the relationship between carcinoid syndrome and survival.  Findings  Between April 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2011, 9512 eligible patients were diagnosed with NETs, of whom 1786 (19%) had carcinoid syndrome. The number of patients with NETs and carcinoid syndrome increased from 50 (11%) of 465 patients in 2000 to 160 (19%) of 854 in 2011 (p  Interpretation  This population-based analysis reveals that carcinoid syndrome is significantly associated with tumour grade, stage, and primary tumour site, and leads to shorter survival compared with those patients without carcinoid syndrome. An improved understanding of the heterogeneity of presenting symptoms among patients with NETs might permit more tailored assessment and management than at present and enable future research into the effect of carcinoid syndrome control on patient survival.

Two placebo-controlled studies have recently demonstrated that somatostatin analogues delay time to progression. The effect of OCT-L on overall survival (OS) has not been evaluated. Methods: Stage IV NET patients diagnosed between 1/1999 and 12/2009 were identified from the SEER-Medicare database.

        "abstract": "Purpose The high cost of oncology drugs threatens the affordability of cancer care. Previous research identified drivers of price growth of targeted oral anticancer medications (TOAMs) in private insurance plans and projected the impact of closing the coverage gap in Medicare Part D in 2020. This study examined trends in TOAM prices and patient out-of-pocket (OOP) payments in Medicare Part D and estimated the actual effects on patient OOP payments of partial filling of the coverage gap by 2012. Methods Using SEER linked to Medicare Part D, 2007 to 2012, we identified patients who take TOAMs via National Drug Codes in Part D claims. We calculated total drug costs (prices) and OOP payments per patient per month and compared their rates of inflation with general health care prices. Results The study cohort included 42,111 patients who received TOAMs between 2007 and 2012. Although the general prescription drug consumer price index grew at 3% per year over 2007 to 2012, mean TOAM prices increased by nearly 12% per year, reaching $7,719 per patient per month in 2012. Prices increased over time for newly and previously launched TOAMs. Mean patient OOP payments dropped by 4% per year over the study period, with a 40% drop among patients with a high financial burden in 2011, when the coverage gap began to close. Conclusion Rising TOAM prices threaten the financial relief patients have begun to experience under closure of the coverage gap in Medicare Part D. Policymakers should explore methods of harnessing the surge of novel TOAMs to increase price competition for Medicare beneficiaries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not eligible for surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a promising technique that reduces the risk of disease progression.    Objectives  To evaluate whether the trend of image guidance for RFA is moving toward the more expensive computed tomography (CT) technology and to determine the clinical benefits of CT guidance over the ultrasound (US) guidance.    Methods  A cohort of 463 patients was identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicare\u2013linked database. The temporal trends in use of image guidance were assessed using the Cochrane\u2013Armitage test. The associations between modality of image guidance and survival, complications, and costs were assessed using the Cox regression model, the logistic regression model, and the generalized linear model, respectively.    Results  The use of CT-guided RFA increased sharply, from 20.7% in 2002 to 75.9% in 2011. Compared with CT-guided RFA, those who received US-guided RFA had comparable risk of periprocedural and delayed postprocedural complications. Stratified analyses by tumor size also showed no statistically significant difference. In adjusted survival analysis, no statistically significant difference was observed in overall and cancer-specific survival. Nevertheless, the cost of CT-guided RFA ($2847) was higher than that of US-guided RFA ($1862).    Conclusions  Despite its rapid adoption over time, CT-guided RFA incurred higher procedural costs than US-guided RFA but did not significantly improve postprocedural complications and survival. Echoing the American Board of Internal Medicine\u2019s Choosing Wisely campaign and the American Society of Clinical Oncology\u2019s Value of Cancer Care initiative, findings from our study call for critical evaluation of whether CT-guided RFA provides high-value care for patients with HCC.",

The pattern of octreotide LAR use in clinical practice has not been well documented. Methods: Using the SEER-Medicare database, we identified patients diagnosed with NETs from July 1999 to Dec 2007. We then excluded those patients with poorly differentiated histology, under age 65 at diagnosis, enrolled in HMOs, and who did not have continuous Part A u0026 B enrollment within 12 months of diagnosis. We further identified patients with potential indication for octreotide LAR use as those having two or more claims indicating carcinoid syndrome, flushing, diarrhea, or malignant islet cell neoplasm within the first year of NETs diagnosis, with the first claim occurring within 6 months of diagnosis. HCPCS codes, J2352 and J2353, were used to identify octreotide LAR use. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to ascertain fac...",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the potential of natural products derived from a mangrove rhizosphere bacterium in tomato early blight management. A Streptomyces puniceus strain L75 was isolated from the rhizosphere of Acanthus ilicifolius Linn in the Mai Po Reserve, Hongkong. The crude ethyl acetate (EA) extract of L75 fermentation cultures has broad-spectrum antifungal metabolites. L75 EA extract was significantly more effective in Alternaria solani growth inhibition at 25 \u03bcg/mL or lower compared to Mancozeb, with no observable negative impacts on tomato leaves or root development. Furthermore, L75 EA extract had significantly lower aquatic toxicity than Mancozeb under the same concentrations. L75 EA extract targets germ tube elongation of A. solani conidia, with a fungistatic mode of action. Liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis identified two possible antifungal compounds, Alteramide A and the Heat-Stable Antifungal Factor, which together contribute partially to the bioactivity of L75 EA extract. On detached tomato leaves, co-inoculation of A. solani with L75 EA extract of 50, 25 and 5 \u03bcg/mL reduced diseased areas by approximately 98, 90 and 48% respectively relative to the control after 5 days. This study demonstrates the potential of natural products from mangrove rhizosphere bacteria in agricultural applications.",

In spite of increasing reports about the interactions between some model phytoplankton and bacteria, there are still lots of unknowns about interactions between dinoflagellate Akashiwo sanguinea and its phycosphere bacteria. Here we used both cultivation and metagenomic sequencing methods to investigate the microbial community composition in A. sanguinea batch cultures under different growth conditions. The microbial community dynamics under different growth stages and nutrient (nitrogen and iron) deplete scenarios were determined by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Rhodobacteraceae, Alteromonadaceae and Flavobacteriaceae were the main bacterial families and varied significantly under different states of the host A. sanguinea. Selective fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was also performed to label Rhodobacterale and Alteromonas clade bacteria to confirm their attachment with A. sanguinea cells under confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Plate streaking practice isolated 19 bacterial strains from A. sanguinea culture and identified through 16S rRNA analysis. Most culturable strains (11 out of 19) belonged to Rhodobacteraceae and consisted with the Illumina MiSeq sequencing data. The possible interaction pathway between these epibiotic bacteria and A. sanguinea in the phycosphere was also discussed.",

This paper demonstrates a nonlinear approach of a real-time induction motor model implemented in a National Instrument real-time platform. Many studies have been conducted concerning on the real-time modelling of induction motors, but lots of the models are limited to linear ones. This paper presents the modeling, real-time implementation and experimental validation of a nonlinear induction motor model mounted on an electrical vehicle. The experimental validation system consists of two parts, the motor controller and the model motor. The model motor is a real-time simulation model based on the nonlinear stator flux model. The consistency of electrical characteristics between the model motor and the real motor is guaranteed by adding the external electrical interface circuit. The system can be used to deliver the testing and researching of motor control systems instead of the real ones. The experimental results show that the model motor can effectively simulate the characteristics of true induction motors. Thus, it can be applied in studies of electrical vehicle systems.",

Based on the optimal preview control driver model, a nonlinear double deck driver model considering vehicle time-varying characteristics and driveru0027s dynamic correction is established, and the driver parameters are optimized by particle swarm optimization. The deficiency of the preview follow-up theory is analyzed, a new adaptive strategy of preview time is proposed, and an adaptive function based on the probability distribution and logic curve is constructed. To verify the validity of the model, a complex nonlinear vehicle dynamics model with multiple degrees of freedom is established. According to the simulation test results, the proposed driver model can meet the complex path and critical conditions of the tracking requirements, and it can effectively reduce the tracking error, enhance the stability margin of the closed-loop simulation and reduce the operation burden for the driver at the same time.",

Its mean purpose is to reduce the demand for sensors by only using five points. Also the distance between these five preview points is determined by the longitudinal velocity. The computation of the controller has been achieved by casting the model predictive control (MPC) for tracking problem into the quadratic programming (QP) problem. The steering angle is minimized to generate the optimal control sequence and the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches are demonstrated through co-simulations of Matlab/Simulink and CarSim under the different velocity. And the simulation results show that the MPC controller is suitable for reducing the lateral displacement and achieving better performance.",

It meets the requirement of four-wheel independent steering function with large scale. The design keeps wheel steering center axis to coincide with the virtual wheel kingpin, thereby realizing the application of the center point steering independent suspension system in electric wheels. In addition, modular design is adopted to reduce the coupling between the system and the car body, thereby realizing the generalization of the front and rear steering suspension system, and it also decreases the number of components. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis and parameter design of the self-aligning torque of the suspension are carried out.

Aiming at these issues, this paper presents a new lane detection method combined fuzzy control with RANSAC algorithm. The first process of the new lane detection method is pretreatment, the purpose of which is to denoise the image preliminarily through filtering and binarization. And then it selects the region of interest (ROI) that contains lanes in the input image and extract the initial boundary candidate points of the lanes in ROI. So far, there are still a lot of irrelevant noise points in the set of lane boundary candidate points. It would analyze the relationship between the interferential noise points and the boundary points of the lane, and then remove the interferential noise points from the set of lane boundary candidate points by using the fuzzy control. After that, fit the lane model by using RANSAC algorithm in the set of effective lane boundary points. The experiment shows that the method proposed in this paper has high robustness and effectiveness which can accurately detect the lanes in complicated city road.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle states and the road friction coefficient in active safety control systems have become increasingly prominent. However, a low-cost, high-precision system in real-time has yet to be achieved. The use of complex models has led to poor real-time estimation, while variations in the road friction coefficient have often been neglected. This paper adopts information fusion technology by using DEKF theory for rapid simulation and estimation of these parameters. Using a vehicle dynamic model based on three degrees of freedom (3-DOF) and the Highway Safety Research Institute tire model, DEKF recursive estimation models are established and verified. In the DEKF, two recursive state and parameter estimation models exist in parallel. The models are dependent upon each other and have real-time interaction correction in order to forecast information, which quickly yields true value estimation in simulation. Experimental brake test results show that the DEKF estimator not only accurately estimates the vehicle state parameters, but also estimates the road friction coefficient in real-time. This can reduce the cost of the vehicle sensor, and can estimate the status parameter, which is difficult to measure. The validity and feasibility of this algorithm have been verified by an HIL driving simulator, offering the possibility of future application in real cars.",

        "abstract": "The MJ-class superconducting magnetic energy storage system (SMES) is most likely put into commercial utility applications. In China, several 1-100-MJ-class high-temperature superconducting (HTS) SMES projects are undergoing preresearch and conceptual design stage by the government and the power grid corporations, and these SMESs will be developed later. The configurations of commonly used SMES magnets are single-solenoid, multiple-solenoid, and toroidal magnets. Each configuration has its own electromagnetic and mechanical characteristics. In this paper, an optimal design and comparison were carried out to explore the suitable configuration for the MJ-class SMES magnet. As the critical current of the conductor is strongly influenced by the magnetic field and its applied direction, optimization of the HTS coil's configuration is required to minimize the length of the HTS wire. The optimization was conducted with the genetic algorithm and the finite-element method. In order to find the dependence of energy storage capacity on the wire cost, the magnet schemes of seven energy requirements were investigated. An optimal design is performed for the seven stored energies with the three types of magnet configurations. The comparisons between single-solenoid, four-solenoid, and toroidal coils are presented. The magnetic field and stress distribution of the SMES magnet are also depicted.",

In order to prevent the thermal runaway of a SMES magnet, quantitative analysis of its thermal status is inevitable. In this paper, the loss characteristics of a self-developed 150\u00a0kJ SMES magnet are analyzed by means of experiments and simulations, including the loss of the joint resistance, the eddy current loss of the metal cooling structures and the AC loss of the superconducting magnet. A thermal model of the magnet was built to theoretically analyze the relationship between the current and magnet temperature variation. Three kinds of power compensation experiments were carried out to study the thermal characteristics of the SMES magnet. The temperature variation of the magnet under these three operating conditions was simulated. The simulation results and experimental results are compared and analyzed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, through AC and DC overcurrent tests on second generation high temperature superconducting tape (2G HTS tape), we respectively summarize the typical types of quenching resistance and corresponding quenching degree, in which there are three types under AC overcurrent and two types under DC overcurrent. According to experimental results, a rule was found that, when 2G HTS tape quenches to normal state, the relationship between quenching resistance and joule heat generated from 2G HTS tape presents a fixed trend line, and the influence of liquid nitrogen can be ignored. Then, the characteristics and rules of quenching resistance found in experiments are well explained and confirmed by a detailed 3D finite element model of 2G HTS tape including electromagnetic field and thermal field. Finally, based on above works, our group proposes a new equivalent method to estimate the quenching resistance, where the results of AC and DC overcurrent experiments can be equivalent to each other within a certain range. Compared with FEM, the method has the following advantages: (i) The method is simple and easy to implement. (ii) This method combines precision and computational efficiency. (iii) With superconducting tape quenching to normal state, this method presents a good consistency with experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) is expected to be utilized in the power grid for dynamic power compensation. However, a SMES status such as magnet current (including parameters of power conditioning system) and temperature of superconducting (SC) magnet will restrict the output capability of SMES. This paper proposes a new method to evaluate SMES status, which will guarantee the dynamic thermal stability of SC magnet applied in power grid. First, it is generally analyzed that the output capability (Pmax) of a SMES is restricted by the initial (standby) current (I0) in the SC magnet for a specific application of SMES. To prove that Pmax also depends on the temperature (T0) of the SC magnet, the thermal characteristics of the SC magnet is simulated with a 5 MJ SMES model. Based on these restricted conditions and the simulation results, a SMES status evaluation method (SSEM) is constructed and implemented. Then, with combination of test data gotten from open-loop experiments of a real 150-kJ/100-kW conduction-cooled SMES, the presented SSEM is realized by simulation in MATLAB/Simulink, the simulation results preliminarily verify the feasibility and effectiveness of SSEM. Furthermore, SSEM is applied to dynamic experiments, whereas the 150-kJ/100-kW SMES is set for damping power oscillation after the short-circuit fault in a physical simulated power grid. The proposed SSEM presents a potential way to optimize SMES operation in the power system.",

The quench of superconducting magnets will affect the normal operation of SMES, and even damage the device. So a quick and precise quench detection is needed to ensure the safety of SMES. During the dynamic power compensation, the current flowing in the superconducting magnet is not constant, and shows high frequency components due to the switching of the converter. This paper proposes a flux induction based quench detection method that can compensate nearly all the inductive voltage and electromagnetic noise. Furthermore, it can be used to locate the exact quench position. The principle of this new method is analyzed, and a quench detection scheme for a 35 kJ HTS SMES is designed.

The rotor of the generator is made of low temperature superconductor (LTS) coils, which are wound from NbTi/Cu cable-in-conduit conductors (CICC) cooled with forced flow supercritical helium at 4 K. To ensure the stability of the generator rotor, it is necessary to design a reliable cryogenic system. With consideration of the radiation heat loads, ac loss, conduction heat leak by residual gas, current leads and torque tube, the heat load of the cryogenic system is analyzed. Aiming at decreasing the heat load of the cryogenic system and enhancing the overall efficiency of the generator, new structures of torque tube and thermal shields are proposed, and the main parameters of the cryogenic system are determined.",

        "abstract": "Under transient operating conditions, especially in the case of alternating current or pulse current, the high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnet will suffer ac losses leading to changes in the temperature and critical current distribution throughout the magnet. A magneto-thermal model is needed to simulate this process. In fact, the state change of the magnet will lead to a nonlinear performance of the HTS magnet in the power system. This paper introduces a coupling simulation and modeling method for the HTS magnet based on a cosimulation model built in MATLAB and COMSOL. The HTS magnet element is a customized module created via the self-code S-Function in MATLAB. A magneto-thermal finite element model based on the  PDE  and  Heat Transfer  modules of COMSOL is built into the S-Function. This model allows the state of the HTS magnet to be monitored during the operating process. A small-scale HTS magnet including three single pancake coils with a dc excitation system is illustrated to verify the nonlinear characteristic of the HTS magnet and the effectiveness of this coupling simulation and modeling method.",

        "abstract": "With the development of modern power systems, the occurrence of fault current and system sensitivity to fault current have increased. Along with extensive damage to network hardware, considerable consumer losses can result from fault current events. However, with the extensive application of voltage source converter based power systems, large dc fault current becomes an important issue due to the bottleneck of the capacity of the dc breaker. To provide effective dc power system fault protection, a novel dc superconducting current fault limiter (dc SFCL) was designed. Here, the working principles and the mathematical model of the designed SFCL are presented. The simulation test based on SIMULINK and the demonstrator experiment were performed to confirm the correctness of the theoretical analysis. The test results show that the dc SFCL exhibits a rapid response time and good current limiting performance in dc systems.",

This paper presents the basic structure and the electromagnetic analysis of SISFCL. In order to study the leakage magnetic flux distribution of the SISFCL, two approaches have been used to model the transient behavior of such device. The leakage magnetic flux distribution of the limiter was calculated, respectively, by using the finite element method (FEM) and the magnetic field division method. By considering the SISFCL as a controlled voltage source dominated by the flux through the ac coils, we establish a magnetic circuit. With the magnetic circuits, we calculate the steady-state impedance. Comparing the results with the FEM model, we verify the validity of the equivalent magnetic circuit model.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) is an efficient way to solve the short-circuit problems in modern power systems. A flux-coupling-type SFCL (FC-SFCL) based on disconnecting coupling windings for current reduction has been developed in this study. FC-SFCL is considered as a potential scheme to limit fault currents due to its low steady impedance before fault and higher current-limiting impedance after fault. It contains a pair of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coupling coils, wound on an iron core with air gaps. Raising the coupling coefficient of the HTS coils and reducing the loss are essential issues to improve its performance, which is mainly affected by the iron core structure and winding processes of HTS coils. In this study, the electromagnetic design of a 10 kV/500 A FC-SFCL one-phase prototype is completed based on a genetic algorithm, along with the performances of current-limiting capacity, response time, and loss of the prototype. The simulation results show the FC-SFCL prototype with electromagnetic parameters meets the design requirements, and has good performances in terms of current reduction and loss.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, high-voltage dc power transmission is widely developed in the world. However, it is difficult for the existing dc breaker to cut off the fault transmission line with large short-circuit fault current. In a short-circuit fault of dc systems, short-circuit fault current is composed of initial transient impulse current and steady-state fault current. Therefore, a hybrid-type dc superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) is proposed with two-stage current limiting capability. In the early stage of short-circuit fault, initial transient impulse current is limited by inductance and resistance. In the later stage of short-circuit fault, a sustained and steady current-limiting resistance is provided by the dc SFCL. A small-scale prototype of the dc SFCL is developed and the parameter design of the dc SFCL prototype is presented. According to the experimental tests and simulation analysis, the design schemeu0027s effectiveness can be confirmed from high current-limiting ratio. Based on experimental tests and simulation analysis, the current-limiting characteristics and energy loss characteristics of the hybrid-type dc SFCL have been well verified.",

        "abstract": "At present, the Tokamak has become a mainstream form of the magnetic confinement fusion device. The toroidal field (TF) magnet in the Tokamak system is required to generate a high-steady field to confine and shape the high temperature plasma. To secure high current density and high thermal stability, the no-insulation (NI) winding technique is used in the fabrication of the TF magnet. During plasma operation, heat is generated in the TF magnet caused by the interaction with central solenoid (CS) coils, poloidal field (PF) coils, and the plasma current. The heat generated in NI coils is complex owing to the existence of current flow between adjacent turns. Thus, it is necessary to calculate the thermal problems. Taking into consideration the effect of turn-to-turn contact resistance, this paper presents the thermal behavior of a NI toroidal magnet under different operating conditions. The NI toroidal magnet is composed of 10 double-pancake (DP) coils wound with BSCCO tapes. The analysis procedure combines the finite element method (FEM) with an equivalent circuit model. This analysis has applicability and practical directive to the design of cryogenic cooling system for NI toroidal magnet.",

In this paper, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN) prediction model to calculate the ac loss in real-time and apply the ANN prediction model to a 150 kJ self-made HTS SMES. The ANN prediction model is composed of a multi-scale model and an ANN. An ac loss data set calculated with the multi-scale model is used to train the ANN, and a validation data set is used to test the accuracy of the ANN after training. By comparing with the homogenization model, we find that the multi-scale model is reliable when used for ac loss calculation and suitable for building ac loss data set due to its high calculation speed. The ANN prediction model is verified to be reliable for fast estimation of the ac loss, and its accuracy improves as the scale of the training data set increases.",

In this paper, a flux-coupling-type SFCL (FC-SFCL) based on disconnecting coupling windings for current reduction is considered as a potential scheme to limit fault currents due to its low steady impedance before a fault and higher current-limiting impedance after a fault. Three types of winding methods of the FC-SFCL are introduced and the main parameters are discussed, along with the voltage distribution of the coils. Based on these, the optimal winding structure is determined, a small-scale test prototype is designed and fabricated, and a series of experimental tests is conducted. From the demonstrated experimental results, the FC-SFCL prototype is able to effectively suppress the fault current\u2019s steady value to a lower level, and it has good performance in terms of current reduction.",

        "abstract": "For a high penetration microgrid, improving its low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability under some minor or temporary faults can contribute to reinforcing power support and reducing network instability. In this paper, the comparison of a superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) and a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) for LVRT capability enhancement of a 10-kV microgrid is conducted. Concerning the microgrid which includes distributed photovoltaic generation, energy storage and loads, the effects of the SFCL and the DVR are compared in detail, and related theoretical analysis, simulation study, and economical evaluation are carried out. From the demonstrated results, the suggested two devices can both assist the microgrid to achieve the LVRT operation, but the economics of the DVR are weaker than the SFCL. Moreover, compared to the DVR, the SFCL enables the energy storage unit to offer better control effects in power stabilization. From technical and economic perspectives, the SFCL is a more preferable choice than the DVR.",

        "abstract": "This paper suggests a small-scale superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) to enhance the transient behaviors of a 100\u00a0kW grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system, and conducts the conceptual design and performance evaluation. Considering the PV system requirements, the stored energy of the SMES is 90 kJ, and the YBCO tapes are adopted to make a solenoid SMES magnet. Based on the genetic algorithm, the magnet parameters including critical current, tape length, parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields are optimized. Using simulation tools, the effects of the SMES on the PV system are assessed, and the electromagnetic properties, stress, and loss of the SMES magnet are analyzed. The results prove that 1) the SMES improves the fault-ride-through capability and realizes an effective protection for the PV system. 2) A relatively large perpendicular magnetic field is found in both ends of the SMES magnet, and the maximum field is induced in the middle of the SMES magnet. 3) The maximum stress of the SMES magnet is acceptable, and the mechanical strength is satisfied. 4) The ac loss is crucial for voltage maintenance performance of the SMES at the fault. Under a short clearance time, the heat accumulation may have a moderate controllability.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a flux-coupling-type superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) is suggested to protect a 15-MW class doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm. Detailed conceptual design and performance evaluation of the SFCL are conducted. From the technical requirements and operational parameters of the DFIG wind farm, a 35-kV/500-A flux-coupling-type SFCL is designed, taking into consideration: 1) the winding type, core selection, and inductance values of the coupling transformer (CT); and 2) the structural style, tape length, and quenching resistance of the superconducting coil (SC). By use of different simulation tools, the electrical and electromagnetic characteristics of the SFCL are evaluated. The results show that the maximum magnetic field of the CT is 2.4 T, and the ac loss of the SC is 0.51 W. Not only the electromagnetic properties and loss of the SFCL are acceptable, but also using the SFCL in the wind farm enables to suppress the fault current, compensate the voltage sag, and mitigate the wind power fluctuation. Thus, the robustness of the DFIG-based wind farm against the fault is enhanced, and the effectiveness of the proposed SFCL design is verified.",

        "abstract": "Controllable reactor is widely applied as a reactive power compensation device to improve the stability of power grid. This paper describes the principle and equivalent magnetic circuit of a new D-core-type HTS controllable reactor in detail. A D-shaped core was assembled with one straight limb, on which an alternating-current working winding was wound, with two parallel rectangular magnetic yokes and four excitation cores between the parallel yokes with direct-current HTS control windings wound around and connected in series with each other. In general, the magnetic flux of the windings for different purposes is orthogonal at the joint and parallel in the parallel yokes. Compared with traditional saturable controllable reactor, the proposed layout can weaken electromagnetic induction between working winding and control windings significantly. Meanwhile, the HTS windings were used to reduce the volume and supply a more effective excitation. In our studies, a 380-V/7.6-kVA single-phase controllable reactor was designed. The reactance, harmonic, and inductive voltage features were analyzed to demonstrate the performance of this type of reactor.",

        "abstract": "Controlled reactors can adjust the output capacity to stabilize system voltage, control reactive power, and improve system stability according to operating conditions. The design of reactance and control system determines whether a controlled reactor can meet the requirement of stable operation. In this paper, the operating principle of a high temperature superconducting leakage flux-controlled reactor (HTS-LFCR) is introduced. The design of the reactance and the optimal initial turn-on angle of the control system are discussed. An HTS-LFCR is fabricated and tested. The experimental results show that the reactance design values are basically consistent with the experimental tests; when the initial turn-on angle of the control system is 90\u00b0, the reactor can achieve a smooth transition from one operating mode to another.",

        "abstract": "The controllable reactor is one of the most effective methods for compensating reactive power. A novel type of high temperature superconducting (HTS) controllable reactor with orthogonally configured core has been proposed, analyzed, and developed. However, for the controllable reactor with dynamic inductance, the excitation analysis based on field circuit coupled method is inefficient and the excitation parameters optimization is more difficult. In this paper, an excitation system containing a voltage source converter and buck\u2013boost converter is established. The reactor is built as a self-defined nonlinear element in the system model based on the dynamic inductance. The inductance matrix, core saturation, leakage magnetic field at HTS winding, and total magnetic flux in the excitation core are included in the self-defined element. The parameters of the excitation system have been optimized easily. The simulation result of the output characteristic of the reactor is consistent with the experimental observations of the prototype. The dynamic inductance method is proved to be fast and effective.",

The basic idea of the reactor is to divide the core into two segments, the working segment on which an ac working winding was wound and the control segment formed by two parallel rectangular magnetic yokes. The dc HTS control windings were wound around the excitation, the impedance of the reactor could be controlled by applying different dc currents to the control coils without the risk of inducing voltage. An optimization algorithm based on the simplified model has been proposed and a prototype has been developed. Laboratory tests were taken under different conditions. Experiment results show that the harmonic content of the inducted current is less than 2% and the adjustable impedance range of the working winding is over 55%.",

        "abstract": "AC loss is an unavoidable problem for a conduction-cooled HTS superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) magnet during dynamic operation, which may cause a temperature raise and affect the reliable operation of the magnet. In this paper, the anisotropic homogenization method is employed to realize the modeling of a 150 kJ hybrid SMES magnet based on H-formulation. The SMES magnet has a maximum of approximately 7000 turns. First, the homogenization method is validated that it can reasonably predict the ac losses of both YBCCO coils and BSCCO coils, but it has lower accuracy to estimate the ac losses of BSCCO coils than YBCO coils. Then, ac loss characteristics of the SMES magnet during dynamic operations are investigated. The magnetic field, current density distribution, and ac loss distribution are presented and discussed for different operation conductions. The results indicate that a steady-state current of less than 100 A may be an appropriate choice during power exchange for reducing ac loss.",

        "abstract": "Although mammography (MG) has been widely used for breast cancer screening in the western world, over-diagnosis remains controversial. Milestone studies showed that ultrasound (US) was an effective primary screening test for breast cancer both in the western world and in China. US improves the sensitivity of screening in Chinese women who have denser breasts and develop breast cancer earlier than Caucasian counterparts, and is used as the primary imaging test in the hospital-based opportunistic screening among asymptomatic self-referred women. Our previous work showed that US result might further differentiate the MG-detected breast cancers into low risk (US+) and ultra-low risk (US-). Indeed, most of the MG+/US- breast cancers would be ultra-low risk cancers and almost always present as MG micro-calcifications. Furthermore, majority of the commonest MG+/US- abnormal finding of micro-calcification is usually benign. Biopsy of benign breast disease increases not only the risk of breast cancer, but the expenses of screening and healthcare. Our hypothesis proposes that mammography-positive ultrasound-negative (MG+/US-) asymptomatic micro-calcifications might not need immediate invasive procedures and be safe to observe until the micro-calcifications increase significantly or become US-positive. If this hypothesis is proved, US would serve as the primary imaging test for breast cancer screening in China, with MG as the selective screening test and diagnostic tool for surgical plan. Unnecessary biopsy or surgery might be avoided with screening expenses considerably decrease.",

        "abstract": "Background:  The heterogeneous nature of the mucinous breast cancer (MBC), with its subtypes of pure (PMBC) and mixed carcinoma (MMBC), calls for more precise individualized prognosis assessment. PMBC showed favorable prognosis in both Chinese and Caucasian women, with nodal status and TNM stage as the prognostic predictors [PMID: 18026874, 22451233]. However, few studies had investigated tumor biology and prognosis of MMBC in Chinese population, especially with respect to the different co-existing cancer components.   Methods:  From January 1983 to December 2014, 197 consecutive MBC patients, including 117 PMBC and 80 MMBC, received breast cancer surgery in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The clinicopathological characteristics, treatment choice, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared both between PMBC vs MMBC, and among subgroups of MMBC according to the mixed entities, including 24 women with ductal caricinoma in situ (DCIS) and 45 with IDC. Univariate and Cox multivariate analyses were performed to identify the prognostic factors.   Results:  The 197 MBC comprised 1.9% of contemporary 10,192 breast cancer (BC). Compared to PMBC, MMBC had significantly more lymph node metastasis (p=0.038), Her2 positivity (p=0.036), high Ki-67 index (defined as u003e20%, p=0.026) and anti-Her2 targeted therapy (p=0.006). All these differences remained significant when the comparison were performed among PMBC, MBC+DCIS and MBC+IDC, and additional significant difference were identified in tumor size (p=0.036), pTNM stage (p=0.003) and chemotherapy (p=0.003). However, no significant difference was found in DFS or OS between any two subtypes/subgroups of MBC, including PMBC, MMBC, MBC+DCIS and MBC+IDC.  High Ki-67 index (p=0.046) appeared to be the significant DFS related prognostic factor for PMBC, whereas estrogen receptor (ER) status (univariate p=0.000, multivariate p=0.062) and immunophenotype (luminal, her2, or triple-negative, univariate p=0.000, multivariate p=0.079) might be the potential DFS predictors for MMBC. None of the above-mentioned clinicopathological factors could serve as OS predictors for MBC.   Conclusion:  This population-based study showed that there were significant difference in nodal status, Ki-67, Her2 positivity and targeted therapy between PMBC and MMBC, and furthermore in tumor size, stage and chemotherapy among PMBC and subgroups of MMBC such as MBC+DCIS and MBC+IDC. However, survival outcomes were similar between these clinical entities and subgroups, suggesting the intra-tumoral heterogeneity might not interfere with survival outcomes of MBC in Chinese woman. High Ki-67 index was identified as the significant DFS related prognostic factor for PMBC, whereas ER status and immunophenotype as the potential DFS predictors for MMBC.

        "abstract": "Background  Anthracycline and trastuzumab are the preferential choices in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Due to the unacceptably high rates of cardiotoxicity observed in the metastatic breast cancer, concurrent administration of anthracycline and trastuzumab (A+H) is contraindicated. However, in the neoadjuvant setting, A+H has shown high rates of pathological complete response and very low cardiotoxicity. So far, all the large adjuvant trials have only evaluated the sequential strategy of administration anthracycline and trastuzumab (A-H), whereas the safety and efficacy of A+H has never been evaluated prospectively. Thus, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate the cardiac safety and efficacy of A+H regimen in the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.   Methods  This is a prospective, randomized and controlled trial. Participants, with HER2-positive, operable breast cancer, but without previous neoadjuvant treatment, were randomized to receive adjuvant A+H or A-H. If anthracycline was administered alone or sequentially to taxane, the dose of doxorubicin and epirubicin was 60mg/m 2  and 90-100mg/m 2 , respectively. If anthracycline was given concurrently with taxane, the dose of doxorubicin and epirubicin was 50mg/m 2  and 75mg/m 2 , respectively. Trastuzumab was given every 3 weeks (loading dose of 8mg/kg, followed by 6mg/kg) for one year. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was monitored by echocardiogram (ECHO) at baseline (before chemotherapy) and 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months after the initial dose of trastuzumab. The primary endpoint was cardiac safety. The second endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01413828.   Results  Between August 2011 and March 2014, 196 HER2-postive breast cancer patients (98 in the A+H group and 98 in the A-H group) were enrolled and randomized. Women in the two groups had similar baseline characteristics including age, tumor stage, hormonal receptor status, chemotherapy regimen, radiation therapy and endocrine therapy. Trastuzumab was well-tolerated in both groups and the primary cardiac event was asymptomatic decrease in LVEF. In the A+H group, there were 11 (11.2%) patients showed more than 10% but less than 20% reduction in LVEF (NCI-CTC Grade I). In the A-H group, there were 14 (14.3%) patients showed NCI-CTC Grade I LVEF reduction and 1 (1.0%) patient showed more than 20% reduction in LVEF (NCI-CTC Grade II). There was no case of congestive heart failure. The difference of the rates of cardiac events between the two groups was not significant ( P =0.400). The mean LVEF of the baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months after initial dose of trastuzumab also showed no difference between the two groups. Patients in both groups had excellent disease control at a median follow up of 16 months. There were numerically more DFS events in the A-H group (6/98, 6.1%) than the A+H group (10/98, 10.2%), but the difference of DFS did not reach the statistical significance ( P =0.485). There was no death in both groups.   Conclusions  Trastuzumab administered concurrently with anthracycline is a safe adjuvant regimen and might improve the survival of patients with HER2-positvie breast cancer.

During optimization, the step length, the maximum height of swing foot and walking speed were optimized with the seven-link biped model. The impactless bipedal walking was investigated for walking on the ground level and slopes with different gradients, respectively. The results showed that the biped consumed more energy when the optimal walking speed increased for walking on the same slopes. There were no great differences in optimal step length when the biped changed the walking speed. The results showed that the proposed approach is able to generate optimal gaits for the biped simply by changing boundary conditions with GA.",

        "abstract": "Melanocortin 4 receptor (Mc4r) plays a crucial role in the central control of energy homeostasis, but its role in peripheral organs has not been fully explored. We have investigated the roles of hypothalamus-mediated energy metabolism during Xenopus limb regeneration. We report that hypothalamus injury inhibits Xenopus tadpole limb regeneration. By loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies, we show that Mc4r signaling is required for limb regeneration in regeneration-competent tadpoles and stimulates limb regeneration in later-stage regeneration-defective tadpoles. It regulates limb regeneration through modulating energy homeostasis and ROS production. Even more interestingly, our results demonstrate that Mc4r signaling is regulated by innervation and \u03b1-MSH substitutes for the effect of nerves in limb regeneration. Mc4r signaling is also required for mouse digit regeneration. Thus, our findings link vertebrate limb regeneration with Mc4r-mediated energy homeostasis and provide a new avenue for understanding Mc4r signaling in the peripheral organs.",

        "abstract": "The angular positions of the lower limb joints play important roles on the energy consumption and stability for the bipedal walking up slopes. In this study, the ranges of angular position of lower limb joints are confined and the velocity of swing foot is zero when it touches the ground, which result in the construction of the impactless planar bipedal model. Motion/force control scheme combined with genetic algorithm (GA) is used to ensure stability and low energy cost of bipedal walking at different speeds. The optimized parameters of gaits are obtained by GA, which include walking speed, step length and the maximum height of swing ankle joint. The results demonstrate that more energy is consumed when the optimal walking speed increases for the biped walking on slopes with the same gradient. There are no great differences in optimal step length of the biped when the walking speed changes. The optimal step length declines as the slope increases at the same walking speed. The ankle torques of standing leg have higher values in single support phase at fast speed compared to those at slow and normal speeds. Modifications of boundary conditions can not only be used to realize the stable walking for the biped negotiating slopes, but also be applied to analyze bipedal gaits for walking on stairs and uneven surfaces.",

We examined phthalate co-occurrence in dust collected from different indoor surfaces and estimated daily exposure to phthalates via dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption. Diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and di (2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were the most abundant phthalates in each of the investigated environments (medians: 58.1\u2013272\u00a0\u03bcg/g, 31.2\u2013145\u00a0\u03bcg/g, and 202\u20131310\u00a0\u03bcg/g, respectively), with detection frequencies greater than 90% except for DiBP in dust from homes. Diethyl phthalate (DEP) was detected only in homes, with a detection frequency of 42%. The detection frequency of dinonyl phthalate (DNP) was 80% in public places (median: 78.8\u00a0\u03bcg/g).

        "title": "A General Mechanistic Model for Predicting the Fate and Transport of Phthalates in Indoor Environments.",
        "abstract": "A mechanistic model that considers particle dynamics and their effects on surface emissions and sorptions was developed to predict the fate and transport of phthalates in indoor environments. A controlled case study was conducted in a test house to evaluate the model. The model-predicted evolving concentrations of benzyl butyl phthalate in indoor air and settled dust and on interior surfaces are in good agreement with measurements. Sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the effects of parameter uncertainties on model predictions. The model was then applied to a typical residential environment to investigate the fate of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and the factors that affect its transport. The predicted steady-state DEHP concentrations were 0.14 \u03bcg/m in indoor air and ranged from 80-46000 \u03bcg/g in settled dust on various surfaces, which are generally consistent with the measurements of previous studies in homes in different countries. An increase in the mass concentration of indoor particles may significantly enhance DEHP emission and its concentrations in air and on surfaces, whereas increasing ventilation has only a limited effect in reducing DEHP in indoor air. The influence of cleaning activities on reducing DEHP concentration in indoor air and on interior surfaces was quantified, and the results showed that DEHP exposure can be reduced by frequent and effective cleaning activities and the removal of existing sources, although it may take a relatively long period of time for the levels to drop significantly. Finally, the model was adjusted to identify the relative contribution of gaseous sorption and particulate-bound deposition to the overall uptake of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) by indoor surfaces as functions of time and the octanol-air partition coefficients (K ) of the chemical. Overall, the model clarifies the mechanisms that govern the emission of phthalates and the subsequent interactions among air, suspended particles, settled dust, and interior surfaces. This model can be easily extended to incorporate additional indoor source materials/products, sorption surfaces, particle sources, and room spaces. It can also be modified to predict the fate and transport of other SVOCs, such as phthalate-alternative plasticizers, flame retardants, and biocides, and serves to improve our understanding of human exposure to SVOCs in indoor environments.",

The SPME sampling process is affected by the convection or diffusion effect along the coating surface, but this factor has seldom been studied. This paper derives an analytical model to characterize SPME sampling for semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) as well as for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by considering the surface mass transfer process. Using this model, the chemical concentrations in a sample matrix can be conveniently calculated. In addition, the model can be used to determine the characteristic parameters (partition coefficient and diffusion coefficient) for typical SPME chemical samplings (SPME calibration). Experiments using SPME samplings of two typical SVOCs, dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in sealed chamber and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in ventilated chamber, were performed ...",

        "abstract": "In this work, sixteen novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) and Dechlorane Plus (DP) were investigated in dust samples collected from different indoor environments (home, office, laboratory, classroom and dormitory) in Hangzhou, China. High detection frequencies for most of the congeners were observed, suggesting the widespread use of NBFRs and DP. The mean concentrations of \u2211NBFRs were 389ngg in the home dust, 1125ngg in the office dust, 204ngg in the laboratory dust, 259ngg in the classroom dust, and 825ngg in the dormitory dust. Regarding DP, the mean concentrations of DP were 106ngg in the office dust, 59ngg in the dormitory dust, 56ngg in the classroom dust, 52ngg in the home dust, and 40ngg in the laboratory dust. The concentrations of NBFRs and DP in the indoor dust were positively related to the number of indoor electric appliances and negatively related to the air ventilation rate. The age of the interior decoration has a profound effect on the concentration of NBFRs in indoor dust. The daily exposure doses (DED) of NBFRs and DP were estimated to be 4595pg (kgbw)d for toddlers and 1099pg (kgbw)d for adults. Thus, toddlers have a higher risk for NBFRs exposure than adults. The DED of young adults in college in different indoor microenvironments decreased in the following order: dormitory (657pg (kg bw)d)>laboratory (145pg (kgbw)d)>classroom (140pg (kgbw)d). More attention should be paid to the exposure of young adults to indoor pollutants, which has not previously been the subject of great concern.",

        "abstract": "Phthalates and organophosphates are ubiquitous indoor semi-volatile organic contaminants (SVOCs) that have been widely used as plasticizers and flame retardants in consumer products. Although many studies have assessed their levels in house dust, only a few used dust samples captured by filters of building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC filters collect particles from large volumes of air over a long period of time (potentially known) and thus provide a spatially and temporally integrated concentration. This study measured concentrations of phthalates and organophosphates in HVAC filter dust and settled floor dust collected from low-income homes in Texas, United States, in both the summer and winter seasons. The most frequently detected compounds were benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), and tris (1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP). The median level of TCIPP in settled dust was 3- to 180-times higher than levels reported in other studies of residential homes. Significantly higher concentrations were observed in HVAC filter dust as compared to settled dust for most of the frequently detected compounds in both seasons, except for several phthalates in the winter. SVOC concentrations in settled dust in winter were generally higher than in summer, while different seasonality patterns were found for HVAC filter dust. Settled dust samples from homes with vinyl flooring contained significantly higher levels of BBzP and DEHP as compared to homes with other types of floor material. The concentration of DEHP and TDCIPP in settled dust also significantly associated with the presence of carpet in homes. Cleaning activities to remove dust from furniture actually increased the levels of certain compounds in HVAC filter dust, while frequent vacuuming of carpet helped to decrease the concentrations of some compounds in settled dust. Additionally, the size and age of a given house also correlated with the levels of some pollutants in dust. A statistically significant association between DEHP concentration in HVAC filter dust in summer and the severity of asthma in children was observed. These results suggest that HVAC filter dust represents a useful sampling medium to monitor indoor SVOC concentrations with high sensitivity; in contrast, when using settled dust, in addition to consideration of seasonal influences, it is critical to know the sampling location because the type and level of SVOCs may be related to local materials used there.",

Total airborne concentrations of phthalates were sensitive to indoor temperatures, and their steady-state concentration levels increased by a factor of 3 with an increase in temperature from 21 to 30 \u00b0C. Strong sorption of phthalates was observed on interior surfaces, including dust, dish plates, windows, mirrors, fabric cloth, and wood. Equilibrium partitioning coefficients for phthalates adsorbed to these surfaces were determined, and their values decreased with increasing temperature. For impervious surfaces, dimensionless partitioning coefficients were calculated and found to be comparable to reported values of the octanol-air partition coefficients of phthalates, Koa, suggesting that an organic film may develop on these surfaces. In addition, sorption kinetics was studied experimental...",

This paper provides a literature review of the current state-of-knowledge pertaining to human inhalation and dermal exposures while sleeping. An analysis of the duration of sleep exposure periods is provided, demonstrating that the sleep microenvironment is the predominant indoor space where humanity spends most of its time. Mattress dust is found to contain a diverse spectrum of biological particles and particle-bound chemical contaminants and their concentrations in dust can span many orders of magnitude among bed samples. These dust particles can become airborne through particle resuspension associated with body movements in bed. Mattress foam and covers, pillows, and bed frames can emit a variety of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, including phthalate plasticizers and organophosphate flame retardants, and emission rates can increase due to localized elevations in surface temperature and moisture near the bed due to close contact with the human body. This literature review demonstrates that human exposures to mattress-released pollutants can be amplified due to the source-proximity effect inherent to the sleep microenvironment, where the human body and breathing zone are in close and intimate contact with potential pollutant sources for prolonged periods. Given the findings of this review, human exposures to indoor air pollutants in the sleep microenvironment should receive more attention and future research is needed to fully understand how sleep exposures affect human health and sleep quality.",

This filter forensics (FF) approach provides valuable insights about differences between buildings, but does not allow for an estimation of indoor concentrations. In this investigation, FF is extended to quantitative filter forensics (QFF) by using measurements of the volume of air that passes through the filter and the filter efficiency, to assess the integrated average airborne concentrations of total fungal and bacterial DNA, 36 fungal species, endotoxins, phthalates, and organophosphate esters (OPEs) based on dust extracted from HVAC filters. Filters were collected from 59 homes located in central Texas, USA, after 1\u00a0month of deployment in each summer and winter. Results showed considerable differences in the concentrations of airborne particle-bound contaminants in studied homes. The airborne concentrations for most of the analytes are comparable with those reported in the literature. In this sample of homes, the HVAC characterization measurements varied much less between homes than the variation in the filter dust concentration of each analyte, suggesting that even in the absence of HVAC data, FF can provide insight about concentration differences for homes with similar HVAC systems.",

The experimental results indicated the GSH@CdTe QDs were well applied as fluorescence sensor to detect Ag +  in aqueous with high sensitivity and selectivity. Furthermore, it was found that the enhancement of fluorescence intensity arose from the formation of Ag 2 Te which modified the surface traps on GSH@CdTe QDs.",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is difficult to cure due to the presence of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Accumulating evidence indicates that the CRISPR/Cas9 system effectively disrupts HBV genome, including cccDNA, in vitro and in vivo. However, efficient delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 system to the liver or hepatocytes using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector remains challenging due to the large size of Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp). The recently identified Cas9 protein from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) is smaller than SpCas9 and thus is able to be packaged into the AAV vector. To examine the efficacy of SaCas9 system on HBV genome destruction, we designed 5 guide RNAs (gRNAs) that targeted different HBV genotypes, 3 of which were shown to be effective. The SaCas9 system significantly reduced HBV antigen expression, as well as pgRNA and cccDNA levels, in Huh7, HepG2.2.15 and HepAD38\u202fcells. The dual expression of gRNAs/SaCas9 in these cell lines resulted in more efficient HBV genome cleavage. In the mouse model, hydrodynamic injection of gRNA/SaCas9 plasmids resulted in significantly lower levels of HBV protein expression. We also delivered the SaCas9 system into mice with persistent HBV replication using an AAV vector. Both the AAV vector and the mRNA of Cas9 could be detected in the C3H mouse liver cells. Decreased hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV DNA and pgRNA levels were observed when a higher titer of AAV was injected, although this decrease was not significantly different from the control. In summary, the SaCas9 system accurately and efficiently targeted the HBV genome and inhibited HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo. The system was delivered by an AAV vector and maybe used as a novel therapeutic strategy against chronic HBV infection.",

        "abstract": "Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) may reduce the efficacy of antiviral therapy. However, the studies focused on naturally occurring, pre-existing DRMs among co-infected patients in China are limited. To investigate DRMs prevalence in treatment-na\u00efve human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono- and co-infected patients in China, a total of 570 patients were recruited for this study. DRMs sequences were amplified and successfully sequenced in 481 of these patients, who were grouped into 3 cohorts. (1) The HBV cohort included 100 HIV/HBV co-infected and 110 HBV mono-infected patients who were sequenced for HBV. (2) The HCV cohort included 91 patients who were HIV/HCV co-infected and 72 who were HCV mono-infected for HCV sequencing. (3) The HIV cohort included 39 HIV mono-infected, 22 HIV/HCV and 47 HIV/HBV co-infected patients for HIV sequencing. Next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing were used in this study. The results showed that in the HCV cohort, HCV genotypes 6a (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 3b (P\u2009=\u20090.004) were more prevalent in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, however, the prevalence of HBV and HIV genotypes were similar within the HBV and HIV cohorts. HBV DRMs prevalence was significantly higher in HIV/HBV co-infected than HBV mono-infected patients (8.0% vs. 0.9%, P\u2009=\u20090.015), whereas HCV and HIV DRMs did not differ within the HCV and HIV cohort (P\u2009>\u20090.05). This study revealed that HBV DRMs were more prevalent in HIV/HBV co-infected patients in China, while DRMs in HCV and HIV patients did not differ. Further dynamic surveillance of DRMs may be needed.

        "abstract": "T lymphocytes, which recognize antigen peptides through specific T cell receptors (TCRs), play an important role in the human adaptive immune response. TCR diversity is closely associated with host immune response and cancer prognosis. Although tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes have implications for tumor prognosis, few studies have performed a detailed characterization of TCR diversity in both tumor and non-tumor tissues in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we performed high-throughput sequencing of the TCR\u03b2 chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of liver-infiltrating T cells from 48 HBV-associated HCC patients. A significantly higher average number of CDR3 aa clonotypes (2259 vs. 1324,  < 0.001), and significantly higher TCR diversity (Gini coefficient,  < 0.001; Simpson index,  < 0.01; Shannon entropy,  < 0.001) were observed in tumor tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. The ratio of highly expanded clones (HECs) was significantly higher in non-tumor tissues than in tumor tissues when the HEC threshold was defined as 2% or greater ( < 0.05). Our analysis of the median Morisita-Horn index indicated weak TCR repertoire similarity between tumor and matched non-tumor tissues. The median number of shared clones in tumor tissue and matched non-tumor tissue from each patient was 360.5, representing 5.1-15.8% (10.6 \u00b1 0.4%) of all clones in each patient. We observed extensive heterogeneity of T lymphocytes in tumors and higher HEC ratios in adjacent non-tumor tissues of HCC patients. The differential T cell repertoires in tumor and non-tumor tissues suggest a distinct T cell immune microenvironment in patients with HBV-associated HCC.",

        "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is an immune-mediated disease. The autoreactive T cells in T1D patients attack and destroy their own pancreatic cells. In order to systematically investigate the potential autoreactive T cell receptors (TCRs), we used a high-throughput immune repertoire sequencing technique to profile the spectrum of TCRs in individual T1D patients and controls. We sequenced the T cell repertoire of nine T1D patients, four type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, and six nondiabetic controls. The diversity of the T cell repertoire in T1D patients was significantly decreased in comparison with T2D patients (P=7.0E-08 for CD4 T cells, P=1.4E-04 for CD8 T cells) and nondiabetic controls (P=2.7E-09 for CD4 T cells, P=7.6E-06 for CD8 T cells). Moreover, T1D patients had significantly more highly-expanded T cell clones than T2D patients (P=5.2E-06 for CD4 T cells, P=1.9E-07 for CD8 T cells) and nondiabetic controls (P=1.7E-07 for CD4 T cells, P=3.3E-03 for CD8 T cells). Furthermore, we identified a group of highly-expanded T cell receptor clones that are shared by more than two T1D patients. Although further validation in larger cohorts is needed, our data suggest that T cell receptor diversity measurements may become a valuable tool in investigating diabetes, such as using the diversity as an index to distinguish different types of diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Objective  To analyze the genetic etiology of lateral ventriculomegaly fetal on the genome-wide level with chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), and investigate the relationship between copy number variations (CNVs) and lateral ventriculomegaly and the application value of CMA in prenatal diagnosis of fetuses with lateral ventriculomegaly. Methods  Seventy fetuses with lateral ventriculomegaly but normal or uncertain karyotype were selected and invasive prenatal diagnosis was performed in Xi Jing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University from Jan. 2015 to Nov. 2016. Microarray testing was performed using Affymetrix CytoScanTM 750k arrays and the results were analyzed according to biological information science database. The fetal development was regularly inspected, and follow up was conducted to find out the pregnancy outcome and fetal postnatal conditions. Results  In 70 cases of lateral ventriculomegaly fetuses\uff0cthere were 9 fetuses with pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs), 3 fetuses with likely pathogenic CNVs and 1 fetus with likely pathogenic 1oss of heterozygosity (LOH). During the 70 fetuses with lateral ventriculomegaly, 2 pathogenic CNVs were detected in 6 fetuses with severe and non isolated lateral ventriculomegaly (33.3%). Pathogenic CNVs was not detected but 1 likely pathogenic CNV was detected in 3 fetuses with severe and isolated lateral ventriculomegaly (33.3%). Six pathogenic CNVs were detected in 31 mild and non isolated lateral ventriculomegaly (19.4%), and 2 likely pathogenic CNVs were also detected in these group (6.5%). One pathogenic CNV and 1 likely pathogenic CNV were detected in 30 fetuses with mild and isolated fetal lateral ventriculomegaly. Conclusions  CMA can identify chromosome abnormality microdeletion/microduplication which was unrecognizable by conventional karyotyping analysis. The application of CMA may increase the detection rate of pathogenic CNVs in fetuses with lateral ventriculomegaly, and benefit evaluation of fetal prognosis in prenatal genetic counselling.

A 23-year-old gravid woman was referred for counseling at 24 weeks of gestation because of abnormal ultrasound findings of fetal congenital vascular ring. Fetal echocardiography showed a complete vascular ring with a right aortic arch (RAA), left ductus arteriosus (LDA) and left intracardia echogenicfocus. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed an apparent balanced reciprocal translocation between the distal segment of the long arm of a chromosome 5 and the long arm of chromosome 2: 46, XY, t (2;5) (q3.5; q31.1). This abnormal karyotype was detected in gravid woman. However, the microarray analysis on amniocytes using HumanCytoSNP-12 array detected 2.57-Mb deletion at 22q11.21. Metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on cultured amniocytes confirmed an interstitial 22q11.2 deletion. The fetus was died owing to breathing and feeding difficulties. Our study highlights the clinical value of genetic detection and prenatal diagnosis of Congenital vascular rings by karyotype analysis coupled with SNP array.",

Methods Placental trophoblastic tissues were respectively collected from normal pregnant rats and model rats with preeclampsia, and then mRNA and protein expression levels of CTRP4, interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and caspase-1 were detected with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Primary placental trophoblasts were isolated from normal pregnant rats and model rats; at different time points, flow cytometry was used to detect the number of PIcaspase-1 pyroptotic cells; and qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect expression levels of IL-1\u03b2 and caspase-1. Finally, recombinant CTRP4 protein (at the doses of 0.5, 5, 15, 25 or 50 ng/mL) or neutralizing CTRP4 antibody (at the doses of 10 or 20 ng/mL) were added into the medium of trophoblasts from model rats; after incubation for 72 h, the number of pyroptotic cells and the expression levels of IL-1\u03b2 and caspase-1 were detected. ResultsCaspase-1/IL-1\u03b2 inflammatory pathway was activated and CTRP4 expression was downregulated in placenta trophoblastic tissue from rats with preeclampsia. CTRP4 recombinant protein treatment significantly inhibited pyroptosis and the caspase-1/IL-1\u03b2 pathway in trophoblasts derived from rats with preeclampsia, while CTRP4 neutralizing antibody treatment had an opposite effect on pyroptosis and inflammation. Conclusion CTRP4 can significantly inhibit the activation of caspase-1/IL-1\u03b2 inflammatory pathway, and suppress the pyroptosis of trophoblasts derived from rats with preeclampsia.",

In order to promote the homogeneous dispersion of MoS 2  in PLA and form a strong interface between MoS 2  and PLA, the MoS 2  nanosheets were firstly modified by mercapto-ethylamine, and then functionalized with PLA chains through ring-opening polymerization of poly( l -lactide). The XRD, XPS, TGA and  1 H NMR characterizations confirmed the successful amino and PLA functionalization of MoS 2  nanosheets. The obtained MoS 2 -g-PLA nanosheets were then introduced to reinforce PLA. SEM images displayed that the MoS 2 -g-PLA nanosheets were dispersed in PLA matrix uniformly. TGA results showed that initial decomposition temperature was improved from 275.6\u202f\u00b0C to 334.8\u202f\u00b0C with 0.5\u202fwt% of MoS 2 -g-PLA nanosheets.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, a novel efficient photocatalyst comprising molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanosheets and conjugated polyvinyl alcohol (CPVA) has been successfully synthesized. To effectively coat the conjugated polyvinyl alcohol on the surface of molybdenum disulfide, molybdenum disulfide nanosheets were first modified to hydroxylated molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 -OH) using 2-mercaptoethanol. The morphologies, chemical compositions, crystal phases and optical properties of the obtained CPVA/MoS 2 -OH were characterized. The results showed the CPVA was successfully coating onto MoS 2  nanosheets, and improved the light absorption, electron transport ability and charge transfer ability of MoS 2 . The obtained CPVA/MoS 2 -OH presented a significant enhancement of photoactivity towards chromium (VI) reduction. The CPVA/MoS 2 -OH-1wt% with the filling ratio of CPVA: MoS 2 -OH at 1:100 exhibited the best photocatalytic activity, in which the chromium (VI) reduction efficiency was 96% (Simulated sunlight, 105\u202fmin). The corresponding rate constant was approximately 2.27 times higher than that of neat MoS 2 . The improvement in catalytic performance might be due to the enhanced light absorption and electron transport capacity resulted from the photocurrent response tests and free radical capture experiments. In addition, the effect of the dosage of photocatalyst, Cr(VI) solution concentrations and pH of Cr(VI) aqueous solution on the catalyst performance for CPVA/MoS 2 -OH-1wt% were investigated.",

If this system is used for a long time, the \u201cheat accumulation\u201d phenomenon will occur, the unit coefficient of performance (COP) value will be reduced, and the system energy consumption will be increased. In order to solve this problem, a new type of heat storage of solar and ground source heat pump coupling system was developed in this paper. The solar collector system can achieve high quality heating seasonal storage, i.e.,\u00a0high quality heating in winter and high quality cooling in summer. The falling film evaporation process was adopted to obtain efficient refrigeration. The experimental results show that the buried tube heat exchanger and the intermittent heat storage tank can operate well in the system. In addition, the COP value of the system is 6.96, which demonstrates that the working efficiency of the designed solar ground source heat pump system is high. The working eff...",

However, molecular markers and high-density genetic maps are still lacking on jute compared with other crops. Insertion/deletion (InDel) markers, one of the most abundant sources of DNA/RNA variations in plant genomes, can easily be distinguished among different accessions using high-throughput sequencing. Using three transcriptome datasets, we identified and developed InDel markers. Altogether, 51 172 InDel sites in 18 800 unigenes were discovered, and the number of InDel loci per unigene varied from 1 to 31. Further, we found 94 InDel types, varying from 1 to 159 bp; the most common, were single-nucleotide (23 028), binucleotide (9824), and trinucleotide (9182). In total, 49 563 InDels in 18 445 transcripts were discovered in the comparison between TC and YG, followed by 48 934 InDels in 18 408 transcripts between NY and YG, and 3570 InDels in 2701 unigenes between NY and TC; Additionally, there were 1273 InDel sites in 1129 unigenes with polymorphisms between any two of the three accessions. Twenty-nine (58%) primer pairs represented polymorphisms when compared to the jute accessions, and PIC varied from 0.340 to 0.680, with an average of 0.491.",

        "abstract": "High salinity is a major environmental stressor for crops. To understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying salt tolerance, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis between salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive jute ( spp.) genotypes in leaf and root tissues under salt stress and control conditions. In total, 68,961 unigenes were identified. Additionally, 11,100 unigenes (including 385 transcription factors (TFs)) exhibited significant differential expression in salt-tolerant or salt-sensitive genotypes. Numerous common and unique differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) between the two genotypes were discovered. Fewer DEGs were observed in salt-tolerant jute genotypes whether in root or leaf tissues. These DEGs were involved in various pathways, such as ABA signaling, amino acid metabolism, etc. Among the enriched pathways, plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075) and cysteine/methionine metabolism (ko00270) were the most notable. Eight common DEGs across both tissues and genotypes with similar expression profiles were part of the PYL-ABA-PP2C (pyrabactin resistant-like/regulatory components of ABA receptors-abscisic acid-protein phosphatase 2C). The methionine metabolism pathway was only enriched in salt-tolerant jute root tissue. Twenty-three DEGs were involved in methionine metabolism. Overall, numerous common and unique salt-stress response DEGs and pathways between salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive jute have been discovered, which will provide valuable information regarding salt-stress response mechanisms and help improve salt-resistance molecular breeding in jute.",

The results showed that C. olitorius populations have moderate genetic diversity with an average gene diversity (he) value of 0.322 and polymorphic information content (PIC) value of 0.270 in all accessions. Regarding the geographic distribution, the average he and PIC values were highest in Kenya (0.332, 0.273), followed by Nepal (0.307, 0.259), and China (0.303, 0.253). Among the different germplasm types, the wild germplasm showed higher genetic diversity with an averag...",

        "abstract": "Flax seeds have a high oil content and are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, which have advantageous effects in preventing chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases. At present, flax seeds are mainly developed for oil. Therefore, it is of practical significance to identify the candidate genes of fatty acid metabolism in flax seeds for breeding flax seeds with high oil content. In the present study, a natural population of flax containing 224 samples planted in 3 different environments was studied. The genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of seed fatty acid content was conducted based on specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) data. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of samples from 3 different periods (14 d, 21 d and 28 d after anthesis) during seed development of the low oil variety Shuangya 4 and the high oil variety NEW was performed. The candidate genes for seed fatty acid metabolism were identified by combined analysis of these 2 methods. GWAS detected 16 SNP loci significantly associated with seed fatty acid content, and RNA-seq analysis identified 11,802 differentially expressed genes between high and low oil samples. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that some differentially expressed genes were classified into fatty acid-related pathways. After comparison of these differentially expressed genes with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, 20 genes homologous to other species were obtained. After analysis, 10 candidate genes were screened by GWAS and RNA-seq screening. Of these 10 genes, qRT-PCR assays using flax seeds in 5 different developmental stages showed that the expression levels of 6 candidate genes were significantly correlated with 5 fatty acid contents in seeds of the high oil variety NEW. Through metabolic pathway analysis found that 6 genes were involved in important fatty acid metabolic pathways, and some of them also have upstream and downstream regulation relations. The present study combined GWAS and RNA-seq methods to identify candidate genes for fatty acid metabolism in flax seeds, which provided reference for screening of candidate genes with complex traits.",

The effects of reaction temperature, weight hourly space velocity ( WHSV ), furan to methanol molar ratio and time on stream on the product distribution were investigated. Maximum aromatics yield of 42.0% was obtained over HZSM-5 (Si/Al\u2009=\u200925) with 2-methylfuran (MF) to methanol molar ratio of 1:5 at 500\u2009\u00b0C. With the methanol to MF molar ratio increasing from 0 to 5, the conversion of MF increased from 64.7% to 100.0% and the yield of coke decreased from 22.3% to 11.4%. In this process, dimethyl ether derived from methanol dehydration could promote the conversion of MF to aromatic hydrocarbons via Diels-Alder reaction. HZSM-5 with Si/Al ratio of 25 exhibited superior catalytic activity, indicating that strong acidity was necessary for the coupling conversion of MF and methanol. Additionally, the coupling conversions of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), furfural (FF) and furfuryl alcohol (FA) and methanol were investigated. Functional groups of furan rings did not change the formation pathway of aromatic hydrocarbons but they have different constraints on the Diels-Alder reaction of furan ring with olefins.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To improve the quality of fast pyrolysis bio-oil, an efficient catalytic upgrading process is proposed with pristine Ni/MgO catalyst and ethanol. Esterification, hydrogenation, alkylation of aromatic ring and depolymerization of lignin-derived pyrolytic oligomers simultaneously occurred in the upgrading process. Esters, ketones and alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds were found to be the main components in the volatile fraction of the upgraded bio-oil. Under the optimal conditions, pH value and HHV (high heating value) of the upgraded bio-oil were 5.01 and 24.9\u00a0MJ\u00a0kg \u22121 , respectively. This result suggested that the properties of bio-oil could be effectively improved by the catalytic upgrading process. Moreover, carbon efficiency of this upgrading process was relatively high because that formation of coke is suppressed in the upgrading process.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the mesoporous SBA-15 and a series of modified catalysts based on it, such as Al-SBA-15 and Ni/Al-SBA-15, were synthesized and used for eliminating the char formation during the depolymerization of hydrolyzed lignin. The temperature, time and solvent effects on the lignin depolymerization were also investigated. Results showed that the repolymerization was effectively suppressed over SBA-15 due to its well-ordered pore structure and large pore size. The addition of Al and Ni elements in SBA-15 could improve the lignin depolymerization performance and saturate the instable intermediates. Ethanol was found to be more effective in suppressing repolymerization than other solvents. 81.4% liquefaction degree and 21.90wt% monomer yield was achieved, and no obvious char was observed after the depolymerization of hydrolyzed lignin in ethanol solvent at 300\u00b0C for 4h over Ni/Al-SBA-15(20) catalyst.",

        "abstract": "A series of MCM-41 supported Ni catalysts with high metal dispersion was successfully synthesized by simple co-impregnation using proper ethylene glycol (EG). The acquired Ni-based catalysts performed the outstanding hydrogenolysis activity of guaiacol. The effects of the synthesis parameters including drying temperature, calcination temperature, and metal loading on the physical properties of NiO nanoparticles were investigated through the use of X-ray diffraction (XRD). The drying temperature was found to significantly influence the particle sizes of NiO supported on MCM-41, but the calcination temperature and metal loading had less influence. Interestingly, the small particle size (\u22643.3 nm) and the high dispersion of NiO particles were also obtained for co-impregnation on the mixed support (MCM-41:HZSM-5 = 1:1), similar to that on the single MCM-41 support, leading to excellent hydrogenation activity at low temperature. The guaiacol conversion could reach 97.9% at 150 \u00b0C, and the catalytic activity was comparative with that of noble metal catalysts. The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) performance was also promoted by the introduction of acidic HZSM-5 zeolite and an 84.1% yield of cyclohexane at 240 \u00b0C was achieved. These findings demonstrate potential applications for the future in promoting and improving industrial catalyst performance.",

Ni/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3  catalyst possessed high nickel dispersion and high amounts of acid sites.

The effects of hydrogen donors, solvents and the dosages of catalyst were all investigated in the in-situ hydrogenation process. The results showed that the hydrogen donor of methanol, ethanol and formic acid could all provide hydrogen for the in-situ hydrogenation but the product distributions of bio-oils were different after in-situ hydrogenation. Using alcohols as hydrogen donors, esterification reaction happened between the hydrogen donors and acetic acid. The formic acid could promote the phenols conversion but the conversion of acetic acid was restrained. When the radio of water and methanol was 10:3 and 10:5, most of ketones and aldehydes in the raw bio-oil converted to alcohols and the conversion of acids and phenols was beyond 50%. The contents of alcohols and esters in raw bio-oil increased from 18.52% to 51.14% and 48.21%.",

Conversion of them to stable products in thermal and chemical properties is a necessary step. Herein, a mild hydrogenation process of lignin depolymerization products over Ni/SiO2 catalyst was proposed. Model compound of 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran exhibited a good reaction result. Nearly 100% conversion was obtained at 130 \u00b0C, and the selectivity of 2-ethylcyclohexanol product reached 94.6%. The lignin depolymerization products also had a good hydrogenation result, in which not only the hydrogenation of unsaturated groups but also the cleavage of \u03b2-O-4 bonds occurred. Stable products in thermal and chemical properties were formed, which possessed high heated value and low molecular weight. This treatment is conducive to suppressing the occurrence of condensation and favorable for the further catalytic conversion.",

A catalytic cracking process for pyrolytic lignin was therefore explored using pristine catalysts (MoO 3 , HZSM-5, and \u03b1-Al 2 O 3 ). The results demonstrated that pyrolytic lignin can be converted into aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols in a one-pot process. Among the three catalysts, MoO 3  was more efficient for aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols, with yields of up to 9.2 and 7.9\u202fwt%, respectively, under the conditions of 340\u202f\u00b0C and an H 2  atmosphere. Catalyst dosage, reaction temperature, and H 2  pressure were investigated in detail, and it was found that the aromatic hydrocarbon yield was highly catalyst dosage dependent. The regeneration of used catalyst was also explored, and the catalytic activity of regenerated MoO 3  catalyst was recovered by calcination in the presence of O 2 . This work provides a potential alternative for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols from pyrolytic lignin.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Heavy fraction of bio-oil, the bottom-layer of biomass fast pyrolysis oil, is hard to be directly used due to its high molecular weight, complex components and deteriorate thermal stability. Here, a novel catalytic hydrotreating process for the heavy fraction of bio-oil, including depolymerization, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), is proposed with Ru/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3  catalyst and super/subcritical ethanol. Results demonstrated that heavy fraction of bio-oil was depolymerized into monomeric phenolic compounds, and then was converted to hydrocarbons by hydrodeoxygenation in one-pot. The average molecular weight (M w ) of upgraded oil decreased drastically from 8941\u202fg/mol to 937\u202fg/mol during the catalytic hydrotreating process, and the formation of coke is suppressed. Under the optimal conditions, the total yield of hydrocarbons, which were comprised of alkyl-substituted cyclohexane and alkyl-substituted benzene, could be up to 23.15%. These hydrocarbons have a high octane number, would be the desirable components for fungible liquid transportation fuel. Furthermore, Ru/\u03b1-Al 2 O 3  catalyst can be regenerated by calcination in the presence of O 2 . These results indicated high quality fuels could be obtained from heavy fraction of bio-oil over suitable catalytic system.",

Results showed that lignin produced a high amount of guaiacols in the presence of ZnCl 2 , while a high amount of phenols in the presence of CrCl 3 . Guaiacylglycerol-\u03b2-guaiacyl ether was used as the model compound to carry out the mechanistic investigation. A synergetic catalysis effect between Pd/C and metal chloride was exhibited in this process. And the Lewis acidity was an important factor to determine the product distribution. With the synergetic catalysis of Pd/C and metal chloride, the dissociation energy of \u03b2-O-4 bond was reduced significantly, which made the cleavage easier to realize. The phenolic monomer product of guaiacols was produced in the initial stage. Then CrCl 3  catalyst with strong Lewis acidity could further promote the occurrence of demethoxylation and alkylation, converting the guaiacols into phenols. This work figures out the mechanism of product control in the hydrogenolysis process and displays a clear potential for the controllable valorization of lignin.",

        "abstract": "Efficient conversion of lignin to fine chemicals and biofuel become more and more attractive in biorefinery. In this work, we used a series of silica-alumina catalysts (i.e., SiO2-Al2O3, HY, H\u03b2, and HZSM-5) to degrade lignin into arenes and phenols. The relationship between the catalyst structure and lignin depolymerization performance was investigated. The results showed that both acidity and pore size of the catalyst could influence the conversion of lignin. In the volatilizable product, phenols were identified as the main phenolic monomers via gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. SiO2-Al2O3 was the most efficient catalyst, giving 90.96% degree of conversion, 12.91% yield of phenols, and 2.41% yield of arenes in ethanol at 280 \u00b0C for 4 h. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that deoxygenation and alkylation occurred in this process. The effect of solvents was also investigated and the results showed that ethanol was the most e...",

Hydrogenolysis performance was significantly affected by the catalysts, via a synergistic catalytic effect between the Lewis acid (metal chloride) and the noble metal. Reaction conditions were also optimized, with 8.6% aliphatic alcohols and 9.2% monomers obtained at 280 \u00b0C for 5 h over Pt/C cooperated with CrCl3. Analysis of the depolymerized products indicated that CrCl3 had a catalytic promoting effect on cleavage of \u03b2-O-4 bonds with the synergistic catalytic effect of Pt/C. Meanwhile, the noble metal catalysed saturation of the depolymerized products and suppressed them from condensing into residues. The sulfonic groups of lignosulfonate were cleaved and they did not cause Pt/C poisoning. The catalyst showed good recyclability, with no significant loss of catalytic activity after three runs.",

        "abstract": "An EtOAc/H2O biphasic solvent\u2013Ru/C coupling biorefinery process was developed to selectively produce aromatics from cornstalk hydrolysis residue (CHR). In this process, CHR was depolymerized in an ethyl acetate (EtOAc)/H2O biphasic solvent system over Ru/C catalyst, which produced aromatics and carbohydrates instantly separated by EtOAc and H2O. Most lignin in CHR was converted to aromatics and nonvolatile fractions, accompanied with partial degradation of cellulose. Optimized results showed that more than 42.7% of aromatics can be obtained under 260 \u00b0C for 5 h without external hydrogen pressure. Monophasic and biphasic parallel experimental results show that the strong lignin dissolving ability of the biphasic dissolution/separation system is helpful for aromatics production and separation, which promoted CHR depolymerization over Ru/C. Furthermore, CHR, products, depolymeirzation residue solid (DRS), and catalysts were carefully characterized by gas chromatography (GC-MS), Fourier transform infrared (FT...",

However, the underlying mechanisms of Notch3 are not yet very clear. Here we show that SUSD2 is one of Notch3-regulating genes and the elevated protein expression of SUSD2 in HGSOC. We also found that its high expression level was significantly correlated with worse overall survival, early recurrence and lymph nodes metastasis. Moreover, overexpression of SUSD2 in ovarian cancer cells promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the metastatic capacity of malignant cells. In contrast, silencing SUSD2 in aggressive ovarian cancer cells inhibited these processes both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found SUSD2 promoted EMT through regulating the expression of EpCAM and EpCAM silencing reversed SUSD2-induced E-cadherin reduction and cells migration. Further experiments indicated a role of SUSD2 in conferring cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer probably through enhancing autophagy in vitro. Collectively, these findings shed a new insight into the role of Notch3 downstream gene SUSD2 and provided a new therapeutic target for HGSOC.",

        "abstract": "Ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) and low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) are distinct gynecologic neoplasms with diverse pathogenesis and characteristic features. They respond differently to same modalities of treatment protocol and have dissimilar prognosis. Thus, it is essential to obtain accurate differential diagnosis of HGSC and LGSC prior to clinical treatment. In the present study, mRNA expression profiles were generated from 5\u00a0HGSC and 6\u00a0LGSC specimen using HTSeq, and 699\u00a0differentially expressed genes (>2-fold difference) were identified using the DESeq R\u00a0package. Dendrograms produced by unsupervised hierarchical clustering completely distinguished HGSC from LGSC. Among differentially expressed genes between HGSC and LGSC, anterior gradient homolog\u00a03 (AGR3) was highly upregulated in LGSC compared to HGSC, which was validated by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Then, anti\u2011tumor protein\u00a053 (TP53) and anti-AGR3 immunohistochemistry were performed on 145\u00a0HGSC and 30\u00a0LGSC samples. Consistent with previous studies, abnormal expression of TP53 (0\u00a0or\u00a0\u226575% positive expression) was observed in 87.6% of HGSC and 13.3% of LGSC samples. Positive staining of AGR3 had a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 89.7% for LGSC. TP53 and AGR3 were both efficient in distinguishing HGSC from LGSC (P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a similar area under the curve for AGR3 (0.848) and TP53 (0.871). Through combination of the two markers (TP53 wild\u2011type pattern and AGR3\u2011positive expression), the accuracy of differential diagnosis was up to 93.1%. These findings provide compelling evidence that differential diagnosis of HGSC and LGSC can be improved by combined application of these two markers on the basis of conventional histopathological diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Activation of the FOXM1 signaling pathway and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that P15 (KIAA0101) was significantly upregulated in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and that high KIAA0101 expression was associated with poor prognosis. FOXM1transcriptionally activated KIAA0101 to drive proliferation and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. KIAA0101 activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway to inhibit cisplatin-induced apoptosis and autophagy in ovarian cancer cells resulting in cisplatin resistance. Thus, KIAA0101 was closely related to the FOXM1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms of poor prognosis of ovarian cancer and have implications for the development of both predictive and therapeutic biomarkers for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

        "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies. Currently, anti-angiogenesis therapy is the most promising strategy for the successful treatment of HGSOC. In this study, we found Neferine could inhibit the angiogenesis of ovarian cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Further analysis revealed that its suppressive effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation correlated with promoting cell cycle arrest and autophagy. The cell cycle genes were dose-dependently reduced and the level of LC3II/LC3I (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3) was increased. Using a specific marker for macrophages (CD206 and Mrc1), we indicated that Neferine could inhibit M2-macrophage in vivo. Finally, CD206 was stained in 150 HGSOC samples and its high expression predicted inferior overall survival. Our current study is the first to demonstrate the anti-angiogenesis mechanism of Neferine by inducing autophagy via mTOR/p70S6K pathway inhibition and suppressing M2-macrophage polarization. Our findings suggest that Neferine is an attractive reagent with great potential in HGSOC therapy, especially in standard-therapy resistant cases.",

        "abstract": "TP53 mutation is considerably common in advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and significantly associated with a poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated the role of Cyclin G1 (CCNG1), a target gene of wild-type TP53 (P53wt), in HGSOC and the possible regulatory mechanism between TP53 mutant (P53mt) and CCNG1 in the progression of HGSOC.\u00a0High expression level of CCNG1 was found in 61.3% of HGSOC tissues and only 18.2% in fimbriae of fallopian tubes. Additionally, overexpression of CCNG1 was significantly associated with a shorter overall survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and progression-free survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0004) in HGSOC patients. In vitro, CCNG1 promoted both tumor cell motility by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resistance to cisplatin (CDDP). In vivo, knockdown expression of CCNG1 inhibited cancer metastasis. Furthermore, P53mt increased the expression of CCNG1 by regulating Notch3 expression, and a positive correlation between CCNG1 and Notch3 protein expression was observed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (r\u00a0=\u00a00.39, P: 0.01528). In conclusion, the activation of P53mt-Notch3-CCNG1 pathway was responsible for tumor progression to advanced disease with correlation with worse prognosis in patients with HGSOC. These data suggest a possible molecular mechanism of disease and highlights CCNG1's potential role as a therapeutic target in HGSOC.",

Methods  The database of Qilu Hospital was searched for women who underwent appendectomy in a primary surgery for an ovarian tumor between June 2005 and June 2015 and whose final diagnosis was mBOT, MOC or primary appendiceal tumor. A retrospective review was performed, as well as a meta-analysis of the literature to further validate the findings.  Results  Seventy-one patients, 29 with mBOT and 42 with malignant mucinous tumors (including 40 with primary MOC and 2 with appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma), underwent appendectomy at the time of primary surgery. Among those with mBOT, two (6.9%) appendices were grossly abnormal and pathologically diagnosed with appendiceal implantation by mBOT. In the 42 patients with malignant disease, five (12%) appendices had a grossly abnormal appearance, one (2.4%) was diagnosed with an appendiceal metastasis from MOC and two (4.7%) were primary appendiceal adenocarcinoma. For grossly normal appendices, only one (2.4%) was confirmed to have microscopic metastasis from MOC.  The meta-analysis included a total of 914 mBOT and MOC cases with appendectomies, including our current cases. The estimated rate of overall appendiceal pathology is 4.97%, and the pooled odds ratio (OR) showed statistical differences between MOC and mBOT (MOC vs. mBOT, OR=2.15,  P  P   Conclusion  There is not sufficient evidence to support a routine appendectomy for patients with a grossly normal appendix in mBOT and MOC. A careful intra-operative exploration of the appendix is crucial, but appendectomy is only warranted when the appendix is abnormal.",

However, the detailed molecular signalling pathway underlying the regulatory link between Smad1 and metastasis remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Smad1 promotes migration of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells by inducing Snail and Ajuba expression simultaneously, but no apparent effect on Twist1 expression. Remarkably, E-cadherin, the best known Snail/Ajuba target gene is downregulated by Smad1 expression. Further, depletion of Ajuba in HCT116 cells significantly dampens the cell migration capability induced by Smad1 overexpression, suggesting that Ajuba is required for Smad1 to induce cell migration. Moreover, clinical analysis shows a significant positive correlation between the level of Smad1 and Ajuba in CRC samples. Together, our data provides the first evidence of the regulatory network of Smad1/Snail/Ajuba axis in CRC migration, suggesting that Smad1 and Ajuba are potential new therapeutic targets and prognostic factors for CRC.",

This study reports a delivery system for Ax through a simple affinity binding with \u03b2-lactoglobulin and then coated with chitosan oligosaccharides. The Ax-loaded \u03b2-lactoglobulin nanocomplexes and chitosan oligosaccharides-coated nanocomplexes were successfully prepared. The nanocomplexes exhibited a smooth spherical shape with diameters of about 40 and 60 nm measured by transmission electron microscope. Spectroscopic techniques (UV-vis, Fluorescence, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) combined with molecular docking were used to determine the binding mechanism of the Ax and \u03b2-lactoglobulin. Compared with native Ax, the nanocomplexes maintain the hydroxyl radicals scavenging activity of Ax under the treatment of acid, high temperature, and ultraviolet radiation. The release experiment of nanocomplexes reveals that the encapsulating could provide prolonged release of Ax in simulated gastrointestinal juices. This study aimed to fabricate and characterize Ax-\u03b2-lactoglobulin nanocomplexes which can improve the Ax stability and slow-released.",

Lentinan extracted from Lentinus edodes was separated to four fractions with different molecular weights with Sephadex G-200 gel chromatography, and intrinsic metal ions were removed by EDTA. The ferrous ion chelating capacity of ELWs was measured to estimate EDTA residue after extensive dialysis. Antioxidant and antitumor activities of the isolated lentinans (LWs and ELWs) were investigated in vitro and compared, respectively. The results indicated that all of the isolated lentinan contained a large amount of intrinsic metal ions and the fraction with the lowest Mw had highest metal content. After removing intrinsic metal ions, the polysaccharides showed lower ABTS and DPPH radicals scavenging capacity and the reduced inhibition of the proliferation of BXPC-3 and Hela cells.

        "abstract": "To optimize the physicochemical properties of phthalocyanine (PC), we examined its behavior in particles of triple helix glucan curdlan (CUR). CUR was denatured and renatured in DMSO, in the presence of PC. Infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that PC and CUR formed an inclusion complex, in which PC was trapped inside CUR molecules. This redshifted the absorption peak of PC, which would improve its usefulness as a photosensitizer, because infrared light can penetrate more deeply into human tissues. The conductivity of the solution of CUR-PC was higher than the conductivities of either a CUR solution or a PC dispersion, indicating that CUR-PC is more water soluble than PC. In addition, CUR-PC was highly stable in water. Thus, the use of CUR as a carrier of PC improves several of its physical properties. PC is used as a photosensitizer for killing cancer cells, but its use is hampered by its low solubility. Further, its absorption range limits its use to a depth of 1\u207b3 mm in tissues. CUR-PC, with its high solubility and infrared absorption peak, was highly effective as a photosensitizer. It killed 84% of HeLa cells under 15 min of long wavelength radiation and had little cytotoxicity in the absence of light.

        "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family. Serum levels of IL-33 are increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), suggesting that IL-33 is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, although its role is not clear. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-33 in the regulation of T-helper (Th) cell and B cell responses in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Here, we showed that IL-33-treated mice were susceptible to DSS-induced colitis as compared with PBS-treated mice. The production of spontaneous inflammatory cytokines production by macrophages or dendritic cells (DC) in MLN significantly increased, and the responses of Th2, regulatory T cells (Treg) and regulatory B cells (Breg) were markedly upregulated, while Th1 responses were significantly downregulated in MLN of IL-33-treated mice with DSS-induced colitis. Our results demonstrate that IL-33 contributes to the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis in mice by promoting Th2 responses, but suppressing Th1 responses, in MLN. Moreover, IL-33 treatment increased Breg and Treg responses in MLN in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Therefore, modulation of IL-33/ST2 signaling is implicated as a novel biological therapy for inflammatory diseases associated with Th1 responses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, caseinate-stabilized zein particles (zein-Cas) were developed at neutral pH to encapsulate fucoxanthin (FX) using a simple antisolvent precipitation method. Fluorescence results indicated that zein or Cas interact with fucoxanthin by hydrophobic contacts with a binding constant magnitude of 10 5 \u202fM \u22121 . The presence of proteins resulted in altering the FX precipitates from irregular shape to spherical shape at higher zein proportions, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The average particle size of FX-loaded zein-Cas particles was below 150\u202fnm (100\u00a0to\u00a0130\u202fnm) with negative surface charge (\u221230 to \u221235\u202fmV). The encapsulated FX showed higher stability, antioxidant activity and antiproliferative activity than free FX. Besides, the bioaccessibility of encapsulated FX was appreciably higher than it was not encapsulated. These results demonstrated that FX-loaded zein-Cas nanoparticles could enable the application of FX in functional foods and beverages, as well as in pharmaceutical products.",

In the present study, fish sauce was desalted by ethanol treatment (including the processes of ethanol addition, mixing, standing and rotary evaporation). The salt concentration of fish sauce decreased significantly from 29.72 to 19.72\u00a0g/100\u00a0mL when the treated ethanol concentration was 21% (v/v). The addition of more than 12% (v/v) of ethanol significantly reduced dry weight, total soluble nitrogen content and amino acids nitrogen content. Besides, the quality of fish sauce remained first grade if no more than 21% (v/v) of ethanol was used. Furthermore, sensory analyses showed that ethanol treatment significantly reduced the taste of salty and the odor of ammonia. This study demonstrates that ethanol treatment is a potential way to decrease salt content in fish sauce, which meanwhile limits the losses of nutritional and sensorial values within an acceptable range.",

        "abstract": "Biogenic amines are identified as toxicological substances in foods and may have detrimental effects on consumers\u2019 health. In recent years, the application of microorganisms that can degrade biogenic amines has become an emerging method for their reduction. The degradation characteristics and application potential of a salt-tolerant bacterium Halomonas shantousis SWA25 were investigated in this study. H. shantousis SWA25 exhibited degradation activity against eight biogenic amines at 10\u201340\u00b0C (optimum, 30\u201340\u00b0C) and pH 3.0\u20139.0 (optimum, 6.0\u20137.0) in the presence of 0\u201320% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0%). Specifically, H. shantousis SWA25 degraded all tryptamine (TRY) and tyramine (TYR) in 6 h, all phenethylamine (PHE) in 9 h, 66.7% of histamine (HIM), 52.4% of cadaverine (CAD), 48.0% of spermidine (SPD), 42.9% of putrescine (PUT) and 42.0% of spermine (SPM) in 20 h at 30\u00b0C and pH 7.0 with shaking at 120 r min\u22121. The enzymes from H. shantousis SWA25 responsible for degradation of biogenic amines were mainly amine oxidases located on the cell membrane. Further studies showed that H. shantousis SWA25 effectively degraded TRY, PHE, PUT, CAD, HIM and TYR in commercial fish sauce and soy sauce samples. Nevertheless, significant SPD and SPM degradation were not observed due to low initial concentrations. Therefore, H. shantousis SWA25 can be applied as a potential biogenic amines degradation bacterium in foods.",

In this study, the Cu tolerance, bioaccumulation properties, and removal ability of growing Pichia kudriavzevii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in complex environments were investigated comparatively. P. kudriavzevii displayed higher total Cu bioaccumulation capacity and Cu removal rate than S. cerevisiae at various bioaccumulation time and Cu concentrations. The Cu bioaccumulation in both yeasts was obviously improved at low pH and high concentrations of NaCl, which resulted in the increase of Cu removal rate. The maximum Cu removal rate of P. kudriavzevii respectively reached to 55.53% at 20 g/L NaCl and to 77.84% at pH 3, obviously higher than that in normal condition at pH 5 without NaCl addition (13.77%). High concentrations of Zn (0.05\u2009\u2212\u20090.5 mmol/L) significantly improved the Cu removal ability of P. kudriavzevii while the Cu removal rate was markedly inhibited with the addition of Cd (0.05\u2009\u2212\u20090.5 mmol/L). Compared with S. cerevisiae, the multi-stress-tolerant P. kudriavzevii possessed more powerful Cu tolerance and bioaccumulation ability at low pH, high concentrations of NaCl and with the addition of other heavy metal ions.

        "abstract": "Fucoxanthin is a major marine carotenoid with many biological activities. It is well known that fucoxanthin is unstable to heat and acid due to its polyunsaturated structure. Another defect of fucoxanthin is the low bioavailability and all these drawbacks make it limited in the food industry. In order to improve its stability and intestinal absorption, fucoxanthin was encapsulated with biopolymers by spray drying in this study. All the microspheres we prepared had a spherical shape with encapsulation efficiencies (EE) ranging from 86.48% to 97.06%. A heat stability test showed that maltodextrin (MD), gum arabic (GA) and whey protein isolate (WPI) improved the thermal stability of fucoxanthin. The degradation kinetics of the loaded fucoxanthin encapsulated with biopolymers also indicated that GA and MD had a better protective effect on fucoxanthin. The encapsulated fucoxanthin degradation rate within MD, GA, WPI and gelatin (GEL) followed second-order kinetics and their half-life (t1/2) was 92.6 d, 99.8 d, 50.9 d and 69.3 d, respectively. The simulated digestion test in vitro suggested that MD, GA and WPI effectively protected fucoxanthin in the gastric acid environment, meanwhile increasing the release rate of fucoxanthin in the intestinal tract.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Organophosphorus pesticides are a class of the most important groups of insecticides and are widely applied to pest and plant diseases control in agriculture. The extensive application of organophosphorus pesticides can subsequently release organophosphorus pesticides into environment which may pose a seriously adverse impact to non-target organisms and humans. However, we could not ban organophosphorus pesticides at present as they are very efficient. Therefore, the new technique of degradation of organophosphorus pesticides must be studied. In this paper, a ternary copper Schiff base complex 2Cu(C 14 H 8 NO 3 Cl)(C 12 H 8 N 2 )\u00b73CH 3 OH was synthesized and characterised by physico-chemical and spectroscopic methods. The degraded effects of 4 pesticides by the complex were investigated. The results showed that the degraded rates of every organophosphorus pesticide were increased. However, the effects of degradation were varied because of the different molecule structures of organophosphorus pesticides. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) and ion chromatography were used to analyze the degradation products by the complex, and then the catalytic mechanism of degradation was proposed. The study results suggest that the Schiff base copper complex, as a potent catalyzer, may find its applications in catalytic degradation area.",

X-ray crystallography reveals that the cobalt atom is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from \u2013C N\u2013, two carboxylate oxygen atoms and two hydroxyl oxygen atoms in different ligands, while the sodium atom is seven-coordinated by two methoxy oxygen atoms, two hydroxyl oxygen atoms in different ligands, two oxygen atoms in the same carboxylate and one oxygen atom of solvent methanol. The reaction results of the complex with the  p -nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) and the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) reveal that the complex can hydrolyze phosphoester bonds. Then the DNA-hydrolysis activity is studied experimentally and theoretically, indicating that the complex can effectively hydrolyze the pBR322 supercoiled plasmid DNA. The molecular docking technology predicts the best binding site and binding affinity between the complex and DNA, and then the catalytic mechanism of hydrolysis is supposed.

Previous approaches employ off-the-shelf features such as SIFT descriptors or filter bank response to build material recognition systems. The recent success of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in object recognition motivated us to evaluate their performance in material recognition tasks. In this paper, we tested the generality of several CNN architectures, including VGGNet [31], GoogLeNet [32], Inception V3 [33] and ResNet [10], on two commonly used material datasets: Flickr Material Database (FMD) and Materials IN Context database (MINC). The results show that the best performing CNN architecture, i.e., Inception V3, achieves at least 5% boost on FMD compared with the other networks and almost reaches humanu0027s performance. The results on MINC-2500 also exhibit the state-of-the-art level.",

        "abstract": "Heavy metal tolerance of microorganisms is the basis of heavy metal removal by growing cells. In this study, a cross-protection effect generated by salt stress significantly enhanced the cadmium tolerance of multi-stress-tolerant Pichia kudriavzevii. Comparative transcriptome analysis using RNA-Seq linked with physiological and biochemical observation was used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the improved cadmium tolerance. The expression of cadmium transport related genes (GSTY2, GLR1, GLO2, YCF1 and YOR1), GSH content and GST activity were elevated by salt stress, suggesting enhanced cadmium conjugation and detoxification in yeast cells. The inhibited cadmium uptake by ZRT1 and enhanced cadmium efflux by YOR1 contributed to the decrease in the intracellular cadmium concentration. The improved expression of antioxidant enzyme genes (SOD1, SOD2, SOD6, CAT1 and PRXIID), along with the enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and POD) resulted in a decrease in cadmium-induced ROS production, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation and cell death. The abundant expression of heat shock protein genes (HSP12, HSP10 and SSC1) and genes related to trehalose synthesis (TPS1 and TSL1) induced by salt stress protected yeast cells against complex stress conditions, contributing to the improved cadmium tolerance. These findings will be useful to develop cadmium-tolerant yeasts for cadmium removal by growing cells.",

        "abstract": "The toxicity of cadmium (Cd) is the major limitation to its removal using microorganisms. The Cd tolerance of Pichia kudriavzevii was obviously enhanced by acid stress based on multi-stress cross-protection. RNA-Seq showed that most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Pentose phosphate pathway, Citrate cycle (TCA cycle), Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, Peroxisome and Glutathione metabolism were up-regulated by acid stress. The up-regulated expression of genes related to ATP synthesis (GOR1, ALD5, ADH4, ADH6, MDH2, IDH1, IDH2, and ATP19) and Cd transport (GSTY2, GTO2, GLO2, and YOR1), and the improvement of intracellular GSH level and GST activity, reduced the Cd toxicity towards P. kudriavzevii. Cd efflux by YOR1 played a key role in the decline of intracellular Cd level. Acid stress obviously improved the gene expression levels and activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT), which inhibited the Cd-induced ROS outburst and oxidative damage of proteins and membrane lipids. In addition, the enhanced expression of HSP12 protected P. kudriavzevii from the damage of Cd stress. These results provide some important clues to reconstruct robust strains using for Cd removal in aquatic environments.",

In this paper, we investigated how humans observe material images and found the eye fixation information improves the performance of material image classification models. We first collected eye-tracking data from human observers and used it to fine-tune a generative adversarial network for saliency prediction (SalGAN). We then fused the predicted saliency map with material images and fed them to CNN models for material classification. The experiment results show that the classification accuracy is improved than those using original images. This indicates that humanu0027s visual cues could benefit computational models as priors.",

Firstly, three novel purified fractions, named MM-P1, MM-P2 and MM-P3, were successfully prepared by a DEAE-Sepharose fast-flow column. Then, their characteristics were compared using chemical testing, FT-IR, GC and HPGPC. The results suggested that MM-P3 had higher molecular weights than MM-P1 and MM-P2. MM-P1 was consisted of glucose, MM-P2 was consisted of glucose and xylose, and MM-P3 was comprised of glucose, xylose and mannose. Differed from MM-P1 and MM-P2, MM-P3 had sulfuric radical and uronic acid groups. Finally, their antioxidant activities were also compared. We found that MM-P3 exhibited better antioxidant bioactivities than MM-P1 and MM-P2. The data demonstrated that three purified fractions derived from different adsorption capacity of DEAE-Sepharose fast-flow column possessed different structural characteristics and antioxidant activity.",

        "abstract": "Crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells remain dominant in the photovoltaic (PV) market due to their cost-effective advantages. However, the requirement for expensive vacuum equipment and the power-hungry thermal budget for surface passivation technology, which is one of the key enablers of the high performance of c-Si solar cells, impede further reductions of costs. Thus, the omission of the vacuum and high-temperature process without compromising the passivation effect is highly desirable due to cost concerns. Here, we demonstrate a vacuum-free, room-temperature organic Nafion thin-film passivation scheme with an effective minority carrier lifetime (\u03c4eff) exceeding 9 ms on an n-type c-Si wafer with a resistivity of 1-5 \u03a9\u00b7cm, corresponding to an implied open circuit voltage (iVoc) of 724 mV and upper-limit surface recombination velocities (SRV) of 1.46 cm/s, which is a level that is in line with the hydrogenated amorphous Si film-passivation scheme used in the current PV industry. We find that the Nafion film passivation of Si can be enhanced in an O2 atmosphere and that the Nafion/c-Si interface oxidation should be responsible for the passivation mechanism. This highly effective passivation is also achieved on various micro/nano-textured Si surface structures from actual production, including a pyramidal surface and nanopore-pyramid hybrid structure with nanopores on the inclined plane of the pyramid. We develop an organic Nafion-passivated n-type back-junction Si solar cell to examine application in a real device. The open circuit voltage (Voc) of the solar cell with the Nafion passivation layer achieves a clear improvement (30.8 mV) over those without the passivation layer, resulting in an increase (1.5%) in the power conversion efficiency (PCE). These results suggest the potential use of these organic electronics with current Si microelectronics and a new strategy for the development of vacuum-free, low-temperature Si-based PVs at low cost.",

        "abstract": "The epitaxial-Si (epi-Si) growth on the crystalline Si (c-Si) wafer could be tailored by the working pressure in plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). It has been systematically confirmed that the epitaxial growth at the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/c-Si interface is suppressed at high pressure (hp) and occurs at low pressure (lp). The hp a-Si:H, as a purely amorphous layer, is incorporated in the lp-epi-Si/c-Si interface. We find that: (i) the epitaxial growth can also occur at a-Si:H coated c-Si wafer as long as this amorphous layer is thin enough; (ii) with the increase of the inserted hp layer thickness, lp epi-Si at the interface is suppressed, and the fraction of a-Si:H in the thin films increases and that of c-Si decreases, corresponding to the increasing minority carrier lifetime of the sample. Not only the epitaxial results, but also the quality of the thin films at hp also surpasses that at lp, leading to the longer minority carrier lifetime of the hp sample than the lp one although they have the same amorphous phase.",

        "abstract": "The use of polystyrenesulfonate (PSS) thin films in a high-quality passivation scheme involving the suppression of minority carrier recombination at the silicon surface is presented. PSS has been used as a dispersant for aqueous poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene. In this work, PSS is coated as a form of thin film on a Si surface. A millisecond level minority carrier lifetime on a high resistivity Si wafer is obtained. The film thickness, oxygen content, and relative humidity are found to be important factors affecting the passivation quality. While applied to low resistivity silicon wafers, which are widely used for photovoltaic cell fabrication, this scheme yields relatively shorter lifetime, for example, 2.40\u2009ms on n-type and 2.05\u2009ms on p-type wafers with a resistivity of 1\u20135 \u03a9\u00b7cm. However, these lifetimes are still high enough to obtain high implied open circuit voltages (Voc) of 708\u2009mV and 697\u2009mV for n-type and p-type wafers, respectively. The formation of oxides at the PSS/Si interface is suggested to ...",

        "abstract": "In this work, a magnesium (Mg) thin film with a low work function is introduced to obtain a downward energy band at the rear surface of a hybrid solar cell to achieve the function of a back surface field (BSF) similar to the conventional n-n+ high-low junction, i.e., favouring the majority carrier transport and suppressing minority carrier recombination. The open circuit voltages (Voc) of the hybrid solar cells with the Mg BSF layer achieve a clear improvement over those containing only the conventional metal electrode (e.g., Ag), resulting in an increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the hybrid solar cells from 9.2% to 12.3%. The Suns-Voc measurement determined using a Sinton tool gives Voc as a function of light intensity and shows that Voc increases linearly with the light intensity for the solar cell with the Mg BSF but increases first and then stabilises for the cells without the Mg BSF. This result is attributed to a difference in back surface recombination, further confirming the effi...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The most important aspect in the development of Si-based photovoltaic technologies is the passivation of the Si wafer surface. Here, we show that Poly(3,4-ethylthiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) thin films, frequently used in organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells as emitter layers, provide an excellent surface passivation with a millisecond (ms) level effective minority carrier lifetime ( \u03c4 eff  ). More importantly, we find that this passivation effect is dominated by the PSS species in PEDOT:PSS rather than PEDOT ones. The PSS thin film passivation yields a high  \u03c4 eff   of 9.4\u00a0ms on a high-resistivity Si wafer. The interface nature of PSS/Si is unveiled by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and first-principles total-energy calculations together. An electrochemical passivation mechanism is clarified: the Si sub-oxides form at PSS/Si interface by the electrochemical grafting O groups in PSS onto Si surface, which can be controlled by injecting holes or electrons into the Si surface, leading to a switchable interface state between oxidation and deoxidation. To examine the application of the passivation strategy in real devices, we develop a polymer-passivated both-sides Si heterojunction solar cell with light-induced enhancement of photovoltaic performances, which is consistent with the light-induced enhancement of  \u03c4 eff  .",

        "abstract": "A hysteresis loop of minority carrier lifetime vs voltage is found in polystyrenesulfonate (PSS)/Si organic-inorganic hybrid heterojunctions, implying an interfacial memory effect. Capacitance-voltage and conductance-voltage hysteresis loops are observed and reveal a memory window. A switchable interface state, which can be controlled by charge transfer based on an electrochemical oxidation/deoxidation process, is suggested to be responsible for this hysteresis effect. We perform first-principle total-energy calculations on the influence of external electric fields and electrons or holes, which are injected into interface states on the adsorption energy of PSS on Si. It is demonstrated that the dependence of the interface adsorption energy difference on the electric field is the origin of this two-state switching. These results offer a concept of organic-inorganic hybrid interface memory being optically or electrically readable, low-cost, and compatible with the flexible organic electronics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, MgNd intermetallic is deposited as a thin film using magnetron sputtering. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is employed to determine the work function of the MgNd thin film. It is found that the MgNd thin film has a low work function of 3.5\u202feV, leading to its application in hybrid poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/n-Si solar cells as a back surface field (BSF) material. By introducing a MgNd thin film into the back Si/electrode interface of a hybrid solar cell, obvious improvements in the open circuit voltage ( V oc  ) and fill factor ( FF ) of the device are observed, leading to an increase by more than 26% in power conversion efficiency ( PCE ). Temperature-dependent current density\u2013voltage ( J - V ) and  V oc  -light intensity measurements demonstrate that the introduction of a MgNd thin layer increases the built-in voltage at the rear interface and decreases the recombination current in the device. These improvements are attributed to the efficacy of the MgNd thin film as a BSF by reducing minority carrier recombination and enhancing majority carrier transport.",

        "abstract": "With the development of novel n-type crystalline silicon based solar cells, low work function metals compatibility for rear metallization without heat treatment process motivate much attention. In this study, we demonstrate contact characteristics and performances of n-Pasha solar cells with Hf/Ag, Mg/Ag and Ag as rear metallization layers. n-Pasha solar cells with Mg contact layer achieved a series resistance of 0.24 \u03a9 in contrast to Hf of 0.82 \u03a9 and Ag of 1.52 \u03a9, respectively. It is visible that n-type crystalline silicon solar cell with Mg rear metallization exhibits excellent contact characteristic. In contrast to Ag contact, the open circuit voltage and fill factor of Mg contact were increased by 9% (relative) with a gain of 47\u00a0mV and 1.3% (absolute), respectively. The resultant power conversion efficiency of Mg contact obtained a gain of 1.5% (absolute) and 10.5% (relative) compared with Ag contact. Thus, this new technique can be exactly catering for demands of rear metallization for novel n-type silicon based solar cells.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Surface engineering of crystalline silicon (c-Si) is the core of Si-based semiconductor devices. The current commercially available c-Si solar cells achieve this by making use of a conventional thin dielectric film passivation system (TDFPS), including SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , SiN  x  :H and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in industry. However, the TDFPS requires high-vacuum and/or high-temperature conditions, which hinders efforts to further reduce the costs of device fabrication. A revolutionized approach to circumvent these issues involves the replacement of TDFPS with new material system which can also achieve high-quality passivation on c-Si surface. Here, we successfully establish and implement a functional group passivation system (FGPS) using a series of functional materials with a sulfonic functional group -SO 3 H, such as \u2018poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid)\u2019 (PAMPS) and \u2018polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene, sulfonated, cross-linkable\u2019 (PS-b-PERB), which can achieve a highly effective passivation on Si surface, resulting in power conversion efficiencies up to 20% when they are applied in the front surface engineering of interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells. Furthermore, the FGPS materials inherently allow passivation layer fabrication in low-temperature and high-vacuum-free conditions. This work provides novel low-cost material strategies without compromise of performance for c-Si surface engineering in the future Si-based photovoltaics.",

        "abstract": "In this study, aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) thin films were prepared by magnetron sputtering from a ceramic target at room temperature for application in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells as a window layer. Different oxygen-argon mixture gas fluxes (5% O2 in Ar) were input in the deposition chamber during the preparation of ZnO:Al thin films. The influences of oxygen content on different properties of sputtered ZnO:Al thin films, including grain structure, optical and electrical properties, were systematically investigated. High O2-Ar mixture gas flux leads to a low dynamic deposition rate, a high light transmission and a high resistivity. The CIGS thin film solar cells show a high short circuit current density but a low fill factor when ZnO:Al window layer is prepared at a high O2-Ar mixture gas flux, which is related to the enhanced transmission and resistivity of ZnO:Al thin films with an increasing O2-Ar mixture gas flux. The highest efficiency CIGS thin film solar cell of 14.7% has been achieved with the structure of SLG/Mo/CIGS/CdS/i-ZnO/ZnO:Al/(Ni/Al/Ni)grids/MgF2 when the O2-Ar mixture gas flux is 1.5\u2009sccm here.",

Thin film solar cells in the configuration of glass/(SnO2:F) FTO/CdS/Sb2S3/Au were fabricated and the highest conversion efficiency reached 3.01%. The defects and recombination losses in the thin film solar cells were investigated by voltage-dependent quantum efficiency and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements.

The Sb 2 Se 3 -based bulk heterojunctions have been applied for photovoltaic with great success, but its potential application to photodetector has not been explored yet. In this work, a self-powered, high-speed Sb 2 Se 3 /Si heterojunction photodetector is fabricated and investigated, where the Sb 2 Se 3  layer is deposited through close spaced sublimation (CSS) technique. The photodetector exhibits detection performance with a responsivity of 0.34 A/W at zero bias voltage and a broad spectral range from 300 to 1100\u00a0nm. Ultrafast response rise and fall times of 86 and 96 \u03bcs, respectively, are obtained, which is significantly better than previous reports of Sb 2 Se 3 -based photodetectors. The high crystallographic quality of the CSS-processed Sb 2 Se 3  thin films and the built-in field at the Sb 2 Se 3 /Si interface is responsible to the high response speed of Sb 2 Se 3 /Si heterostructural photodetectors. The high-speed and broadband response properties make the Sb 2 Se 3 /Si heterojunction photodetector have potential applications for next-generation optoelectric devices.",

To address this issue, several attempts are explored on film formation and interface engineering to improve efficiency. Here, adding alanine into pristine PEDOT:PSS proved beneficial to reconstruct the distribution of the -SO 3  -  and -SO 3 H groups, resulting an improvement of the charge collection and transport owing to the weakened enrichment of -SO 3 H. The conductivities of reconstructed PEDOT:PSS films were improved as well as an enhancement of the hydrophobicity. A moderate concentration of alanine could effectively restrain the generation of \u03b4-phase perovskites film and enhance crystallinity of the Cs x FA 1-x PbI 3.  The hole trap state of Cs x FA 1-x PbI 3  was slightly reduced to 2.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 15 \u202fcm \u22123 .

        "abstract": "Abstract   Inverted perovskite solar cells using pristine PEDOT:PSS as the hole-transporting layer (HTL) have been widely studied for its less hysteresis and low-temperature preparation technologies. However, this device suffers from an inferior open-circuit voltage ( V  OC ) and stability problems. Several attempts have made on film formation and interface engineering to improve the efficiency. Modification proved beneficial to decrease energy offset at the interface between the HTL layer and the adjacent perovskite layer. In this paper, modification PEDOT:PSS layers were realized with a dimethyl formamide (DMF) solvent. The sulfonic acid distribution was homogenized in the normal direction after modification. The work function of the modified PEDOT:PSS layers increased from 4.71 to 5.07\u202feV, and the conductivity of modified PEDOT:PSS increased from 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 \u22124  to 0.45\u202fS/cm. The as-deposited perovskite films were more uniform with larger grain sizes and less pinholes, resulting in an improved  V  OC  from 0.93 to 1.048\u202fV, while the efficiency was increased from 11.5% to 16.8%. Solar cells without encapsulation under the 50\u202fh and 50% humidity aging test showed 7% degradation of fill factor (FF) with 50 v/v% PEDOT:PSS layer, while the fill factor decreased 11.2% in the 0 v/v% PEDOT:PSS layer, respectively.",

For comparison, the annealing of czochralski (CZ) silicon was also carried out under the same conditions. The results revealed that oxygen and carbon concentration of mc-Si had a larger decrease than that of CZ-Si, which means the more oxygen precipitates in mc-Si were generated. High density defects of mc-Si such as grain boundaries and dislocations accelerated formation of oxygen precipitates. Bulk lifetime of mc-Si and CZ-Si greatly increased. The reason of lifetime increase is probably due to the fact that lots of oxygen precipitates and defect complex compounds are generated after three step annealing, which could be suction center of defect, that reduced carrier decentralized recombination centers that resulted in improvement of lifetime of wafer. Tendency of difference of lifetime was correlated with interior structure of crystalline silicon. \u00a9 2009 Materials Research Society.",

        "abstract": "Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common complication in cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for PVT, assess the efficacy of anticoagulant therapy, and evaluate the effects of PVT on patients with cirrhosis undergoing elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS). A total of 101 patients with cirrhosis undergoing elective TIPSS were prospectively studied. After TIPSS, all patients received preventive therapy for PVT and were followed up at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients who developed PVT after TIPSS and those who did not. Multivariate analysis showed that white blood cell count (relative risk [RR]: 0.377; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.132-0.579; P = .001), Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (RR: 1.547; 95% CI: 1.029-2.365; P = .032), and ascites (RR: 1.264; 95% CI: 1.019-1.742; P = .040) were independent predictors for PVT. Warfarin treatment within 12 months achieved significantly higher rates of complete recanalization than aspirin or clopidogrel in patients with PVT (54.5% vs 31.3%; P = .013), although adverse events were similar between the 2 groups ( P > .05). Patients without PVT had significantly lower 2-year cumulative rates of variceal rebleeding (15.9% vs 36.6%; P = .023), shunt dysfunction (27.0% vs 46.8%; P = .039), hepatic encephalopathy (24.1% vs 42.6%; P = .045), and hepatocellular carcinoma (11.4% vs 31.2%; P = .024) and markedly higher 2-year cumulative survival rates (89.8% vs 72.9%; P = .041) than those with PVT. The PVT is associated with poorer clinical outcomes in TIPSS-treated patients, and warfarin is both safe and more effective in recanalizing PVT than aspirin or clopidogrel.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common type of cancer worldwide and remains difficult to treat. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the umbilical cord (UC\u2011MSCs) on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. UC\u2011MSCs were co\u2011cultured with HepG2 cells and biomarkers of UC\u2011MSCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. mRNA and protein expression of genes were determined by reverse transcription\u2011polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, respectively. Passage three and seven UC\u2011MSCs expressed CD29, CD44, CD90 and CD105, whereas CD34 and CD45 were absent on these cells. Co\u2011culture with UC\u2011MSCs inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of HepG2 cells in a time\u2011dependent manner. The initial seeding density of UC\u2011MSCs also influenced the proliferation and apoptosis of HepG2 cells, with an increased number of UC\u2011MSCs causing enhanced proliferation inhibition and cell apoptosis. Co\u2011culture with UC\u2011MSCs downregulated mRNA and protein expression of \u03b1\u2011fetoprotein (AFP), Bcl\u20112 and Survivin in HepG2 cells. Thus, UC\u2011MSCs may inhibit growth and promote apoptosis of HepG2 cells through downregulation of AFP, Bcl\u20112 and Survivin. US-MSCs may be used as a novel therapy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma in the future. ",

It may be rapidly fatal due to multi-organ failure. Liver transplantation (LT) is the best strategy for rescuing patients with ACLF. However, LT is not always possible due to donor shortage and/or high operation cost. The search for a strategy to provide temporary liver support and bridge the patients with ACLF to LT remains an important issue. Here, we report a case of hepatitis B virus (HBV) related ACLF patient who was successfully treated by repeated plasma exchange (PE) and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell transfusion (UCMSC) in combination with antiviral therapy with entecavir (ETV).",

        "abstract": "AIM:  To compare the effects of telbivudine (TBV) with entecavir (ETV) on hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected decompensated cirrhosis.    METHODS:  A total of 94 consecutive chronic hepatitis B patients with decompensated cirrhosis were recruited and retrospectively studied. Forty five patients were assigned to TBV group (600 mg/day) and 49 to ETV group (0.5mg/day), none of whom undertook antiviral treatment before.   RESULTS:  At 2 years, TBV and ETV groups had comparable cumulative rates of undetectable viremia (74.4% vs 88.0%, p = 0.083, by log-rank test) despite higher reduction of HBV-DNA levels in ETV group (-3.93 \u00b1 0.22 vs -3.72 \u00b1 0.24, p u003c 0.001). TBV and ETV groups showed comparable HBeAg clearance or seroconvertion rates, normalized alanine aminotransferase (ALT) proportions, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores, cumulative rates of survival and hepatocellualr carcinoma (HCC), and proportions of cirrhosis-associated complications. TBV group had significantly higher rates of drug-resistance (15.9% vs 0%, p u003c 0.05) and elevated creatine kinase (CK, 18.2% vs 4.0%, p u003c 0.05). Cox proportional hazard regression model revealed that pretreatment HBV DNA level was the only independent predictive factor for 2-year undetectable viremia [Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.627; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.432-910, p = 0.014].   CONCLUSIONS:  For hepatitis B-associated decompensated cirrhosis, TBV was comparable to ETV in viral suppression, biochemical and immunological responses, and clinical outcomes. However, TBV was associated with higher rates of drug-resistance and increased CK.",

        "abstract": "There is limited information about the effects of corticosteroids on severe drug-induced liver injury (DILI). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of prednisone in severe DILI.Ninety patients with severe DILI were enrolled and studied retrospectively. They were divided into prednisone (n\u200a=\u200a66) and control groups (n\u200a=\u200a24), undergoing the same treatment regimen except that patients in the prednisone group received a median daily dose of 40\u200amg prednisone. The primary endpoint was severity reduction (serum total bilirubin [TBIL] <86\u200a\u03bcmol/L).During the study, the cumulative rates of severity reduction at 4-, 8-, and 12 days were comparable between the 2 groups (prednisone versus control: 7.6%, 33.3%, and 60.6% versus 12.5%, 37.5%, and 66.7%, P\u200a=\u200a.331), and were markedly lower in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group (0%, 28.6%, and 35.7% versus 9.6%, 34.6%, and 67.3%, P\u200a=\u200a.012) or in the control group (0%, 28.6%, and 35.7% versus 12.5%, 37.5%, and 66.7%, P\u200a=\u200a.023). The 30-day overall survival rate in the prednisone group was significantly higher than in the control group (100% versus 91.7%, P\u200a=\u200a.018). Serum bilirubin and transaminase values gradually decreased in both groups, which were not significantly different mostly. Cox-regression models revealed that baseline TBIL (hazard ratio: 0.235; 95% confidence interval: 0.084-0.665; P\u200a=\u200a.006) was the only predictor for severity reduction. No severe adverse event was noted in both groups.Prednisone therapy is safe but not beneficial, and even detrimental at a daily dose > 40\u200amg for the treatment of severe DILI.",

METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained; all patients provided informed consent. From January 2010 to December 2014, a total of 141 cirrhotic patients received TIPS alone(group A, n=114) and simultaneous combined TIPS and PSE(group B, n=27) for recurrent variceal bleeding and hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension. The TIPS was created by using covered stents. All patients underwent embolotherapy via the jugular vein after TIPS implantation. Patients in group B (n=27) received simultaneous PSE after creation of TIPS. Biochemical tests, coagulation function, complete blood cell (CBC) counts, frequencies of recurrent variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and survival were evaluated. Model for end stage liver diseases (MELD) scores were calculated.  RESULTS: TIPS creation was successful in all patients. After the treatments, patients in group B had better hepatic synthetic function, increased levels of white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), and hemoglobin(HGB), lower frequency of HE, lower overall and cirrhosis-related mortality than patients in group A (P 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that MELD scores, HE, and group were independent factors for overall and liver-related mortality at month 24 (Pu003c0.05). No severe complications were observed in the two groups.  CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous combined TIPS and PSE regimen improves hematologic parameters, prevents deterioration of liver function and coagulation funct",

The new structures were determined based on extensive analysis of HRESIMS and NMR data, and their absolute configurations were assigned by a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and electronic circular dichroism analyses. Hyrtiolacton A (1) represents an unprecedented meroterpenoid featuring an unusual 2-pyrone attached to the sesquiterpene core, which is the first example of a pyrone-containing 4,9-friedodrimane-type sesquiterpene. These compounds were evaluated for their protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP1B) inhibitory and cytotoxic activities. Nakijinol G (3) showed PTP1B inhibitory activity with an IC value of 4.8 \u03bcM but no cytotoxicity against four human cancer cell lines.",

The structures of versiorcinols B and C were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis, while the structure of versiorcinol A was elucidated on the basis of quantum-chemical NMR chemical shifts, supported by DP4 probability analysis, and DU8 proton\u2013proton spin\u2013spin coupling constants (SSCCs) calculations in consortium with extensive experimental NMR analysis. The absolute configurations of the enantiomers (+)-1 and (\u2212)-1, (+)-2 and (\u2212)-2, and (+)-3 and (\u2212)-3 were assigned from ECD calculations. At very low temperatures, the 1H-NMR spectra of 1\u20133 revealed doubling of signals, which suggested the presence of two conformers in solution. Variable-temperature (VT) 1H-NMR studies supported this hypothesis.",

As a tumor suppressor, SIRT6 has frequently been found to have low expression in various cancers. Here, we report the identification of MDL-800, a selective SIRT6 activator. MDL-800 increased the deacetylase activity of SIRT6 by up to 22-fold via binding to an allosteric site; this interaction led to a global decrease in H3K9ac and H3K56ac levels in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Consequently, MDL-800 inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells via SIRT6-driven cell-cycle arrest and was effective in a tumor xenograft model. Together, these data demonstrate that pharmacological activation of SIRT6 is a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of HCC. MDL-800 is a first-in-class small-molecule cellular SIRT6 activator that can be used to physiologically and pathologically investigate the roles of SIRT6 deacetylation.",

        "abstract": "The latest probable scenario in vaccination strategies is to prime one live attenuated vaccine candidate followed by boost dose of second vaccine candidate. In the present study, we primed the mice with a recombinant Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) comprising Ag85B and ESAT-6 followed by boost doses of Ag85B, ESAT-6 and Ag85B-ESAT-6 fusion protein in the DDA adjuvant, separately. After boost doses of 8 and 12 weeks, the levels of antigen-stimulated T cells secreting interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, the content of the IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-4 in the splenocytes  culture supernatant, the antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G titer from mouse serum, IgG subclass and the population of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were detected. The present study showed that recombinant BCG along with boost doses of Ag85B or ESAT-6 individually did not induce efficient T-helper (Th) 1-type immune response. On the other hand, recombinant BCG with boost doses of Ag85B-ESAT-6 fusion protein enhanced longer lasting predominant Th1 immune response. This result suggested that Ag85B might synergize with ESAT-6 protein in order to produce better as well as effective immune response. Thus, the present study concluded recombinant BCG with boost doses of Ag85B-ESAT-6 fusion protein could be a good strategy to improve the immune protective efficacy.",

        "abstract": "The only available vaccine against pulmonary tuberculosis is  (BCG). As the efficacy reported of the vaccine is not up to the mark, there is an urgent need to develop improved anti-tuberculosis vaccines. Antigen 85B (Ag85B) is a very promising vaccine candidate molecule of  and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and has been considered the most attractive correlate of protective immunity. The aim of this study was to construct a novel recombinant BCG (rBCG) to secrete Ag85B and mouse IFN-\u03b3 under control of the Mycobacterial heat shock protein 60 () promoter and the antigen signal sequence. Second aim of the present study is to evaluate the immune response in C57BL/6 elicted by the new rBCG. Expression of the fusion protein was readily detectable by western blotting and IFN-\u03b3 bioactivity was detected indirectly by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Compared with BCG, rBCG::Ag85B-IFN-\u03b3 was substantially more active in inducing the production of IFN-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 from mouse splenocytes. ELISA analysis for IgG, IgG1 and IgG2c showed that rBCG::Ag85B-IFN-\u03b3 induced higher titer of Ag85B and facilitated Th1 type immune response. rBCG::Ag85B-IFN-\u03b3 also improved nitric oxide production levels and enhanced antigen-specific splenocyte proliferation. Moreover, rBCG::Ag85B-IFN-\u03b3 induced human monocytes such as THP-1 cells to enhance expression of CD80, CD86, CD40 and HLA-DR. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that rBCG::Ag85B-IFN-\u03b3 significantly activated CD4 T cells. Assessing combinations of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-2 at the single-cell level by multiparameter flow cytometry, we found that rBCG::Ag85B-IFN-\u03b3 improved the multifunctional T cells level in comparison to BCG. In conclusion, the present study indicates that rBCG::Ag85B-IFN-\u03b3 increases cell mediated immune response and is a potential candidate vaccine for immunotherapeutic protocols against pulmonary tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to identify novel immunogenic epitopes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) that could be used in tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. To determine the diagnostic potential of mycobacterial antigens in serodiagnosis of TB, 256 patients were enrolled in a study and divided into two groups: 126 smear-positive pulmonary TB patients (SPPT) and 130 smear-negative pulmonary TB patients (SNPT); 152 bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated healthy people were used as a control. Murine results showed that antigens Rv0310c-E from RD 8 and Rv1255c-E from RD 10 were strongly immunogenic to Th1 cells and induced a great humoral response. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that Rv0310c-E (area under the curve (AUC): 0.800) and Rv1255c-E (AUC: 0.808) performed better than ESAT-6 (AUC: 0.665) and CFP-10 (AUC: 0.623) proteins but were comparable with Rv3425 (AUC: 0.788) protein in a human serum IgG analysis. Rv0310c-E demonstrated the highest diagnostic ability for the SPPT group (Youden index: 0.5602, sensitivity: 69.84%, specificity: 86.18%), while Rv1255c-E demonstrated the highest diagnostic ability for the SNPT group (Youden index: 0.5674, sensitivity: 73.84%, specificity: 82.89%). In addition, combination analysis found that antigen Rv0310c-E, coupled with the Rv3425 protein (Youden index: 0.6098, sensitivity: 87.30%, specificity: 73.68%) had the strongest performance for TB diagnostics of the SPPT group, and the single antigen Rv1255c-E was strongest for the SNPT group. These results suggest that antigens Rv0310c-E and Rv1255c-E are potential antigens for TB serodiagnostic tests, which may facilitate detection of MTB in smear-negative and smear-positive patients.",

        "abstract": "Targeting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) PE/PPE antigens that induce type 1 helper T cell (Th1) and Th17 responses represents a crucial strategy for the development of tuberculosis (TB) vaccines. However, only few PE/PPE antigens induce these responses. Here, we sought to determine how the cell wall-associated antigen PPE60 (Rv3478) activates dendritic cell (DC) maturation and T-cell differentiation. We observed that PPE60 induces DC maturation by augmenting the protein expression of cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80) and CD86, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II on the cell surface. PPE60 also stimulated the production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12p70, and IL-23p19, but not IL-10. This induction was mediated by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and followed by activation of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and NF-\u03baB signaling. PPE60 enhanced MHC-II expression and promoted antigen processing by DCs in a TLR2-dependent manner. Moreover, PPE60-stimulated DCs directed na\u00efve CD4 T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-17A, expanding the Th1 and Th17 responses, along with activation of T-Bet and RAR-related orphan receptor C (ROR\u03b3t), but not GATA-3. Moreover, PPE60 activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, followed by caspase-1-dependent IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 synthesis in DCs. Of note, pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 activation specifically attenuated IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A secretion into the supernatant from CD4 T cells co-cultured with PPE60-activated DCs. These findings indicate that PPE60 induces Th1 and Th17 immune responses by activating DCs in a TLR2-dependent manner, suggesting PPE60's potential for use in MTB vaccine development.",

        "abstract": "TLR2-dependent cellular signaling in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages causes apoptosis and inhibits class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) molecules antigen processing, leading to evasion of surveillance. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lipoproteins are an important class of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand, and identified as specific components that mediate these effects. In this study, we identified and characterized Mtb lipoprotein Rv1016c (lpqT) as a cell wall associated-protein that was exposed on the cell surface and enhanced the survival of recombinants M. smegmatis_Rv1016c under stress conditions. We found that Rv1016c lipoprotein was a novel TLR2 ligand and able to induce macrophage apoptosis in a both dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, apoptosis induced by Rv1016c was reserved in THP-1 cells blocked with anti-TLR-2 Abs or in TLR2-/- mouse macrophages, indicating that Rv1016c-induced apoptosis is dependent on TLR2. Moreover, we demonstrated that Rv1016c lipoprotein inhibited IFN-\u03b3-induced MHC-II expression and processing of soluble antigens in a TLR2 dependent manner. Class II transactivator (CIITA) regulates MHC II expression. In this context, Rv1016c lipoprotein diminished IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of CIITA IV through TLR2 and MAPK Signaling. TLR2-dependent apoptosis and inhibition of MHC-II Ag processing induced by Rv1016c during mycobacteria infection may promote the release of residual bacilli from apoptotic cells and decrease recognition by CD4+ T cells. These mechanisms may allow intracellular Mtb to evade immune surveillance and maintain chronic infection.",

        "abstract": ", as a facultative intracellular pathogen, can interact with host macrophages and modulate macrophage function to influence innate and adaptive immunity. Proteins secreted by the ESX-1 secretion system are involved in this relationship. Although the importance of ESX-1 in host-pathogen interactions and virulence is well-known, the primary role is ascribed to EsxA (EAST-6) in mycobacterial pathogenesis and the functions of individual components in the interactions between pathogens and macrophages are still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of EspC on macrophage activation. The EspC protein is encoded by an  cluster, which is not linked to the  locus, but is essential for the secretion of the major virulence factors of ESX-1, EsxA and EsxB. Our results showed that both EspC protein and EspC overexpression in  induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced surface marker expression. This mechanism was dependent on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), as demonstrated using EspC-treated macrophages from TLR4 mice, leading to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and surface marker expression compared with those from wild-type mice. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays showed that EspC interacted with TLR4 directly. Moreover, EspC could activate macrophages and promote antigen presentation by inducing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and nuclear factor-\u03baB activation. The EspC-induced cytokine expression, surface marker upregulation, and MAPK signaling activation were inhibited when macrophages were blocked with anti-TLR4 antibodies or pretreated with MAPK inhibitors. Furthermore, our results showed that EspC overexpression enhanced the survival of  within macrophages and under stress conditions. Taken together, our results indicated that EspC may be another ESX-1 virulence factor that not only modulates the host innate immune response by activating macrophages through TLR4-dependent MAPK signaling but also plays an important role in the survival of pathogenic mycobacteria in host cells.",

In this work, two new farnesyl phenolic compounds, ganoduriporols A and B (1 and 2), were isolated from the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma duripora, and their structures were elucidated using various spectroscopic methods. Anti-inflammatory activities were assayed and evaluated for the two compounds. Ganoduriporols A and B exhibited dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, ganoduriporol A was demonstrated to inhibit the production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and prostaglandin E (PGE) through the suppression of COX-2, MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in LPS-induced macrophage cells. These results suggested that these two new farnesyl phenolic compounds and the fruiting body of G. duripora could serve as anti-inflammatory agents for medicinal use or functional food.",

Compared to studies which quantify religion with indicators representing only restricted dimensions of religion, researches assessing religion as an integral is preferable while lacking. Moreover, religious behaviors have great potential to be generalized if they are proved to be mediator through which religion exerts effect. However, relevant evidence is limited. Therefore, this cross-sectional study recruited 1384 adult Tibetan Buddhists from two Buddhist institutes in the Sichuan Province of China, and enrolled 798 adult Tibetan residents from nearby villages/towns. Each participant received a questionnaire, physical examination, and blood biochemistry tests. Buddhist effect on hypertension was investigated. The effects of uniquely Buddhist behaviors on hypertension were analyzed. The hypertensive risk of the Tibetan Buddhists is significantly decreased by 38% than Tibetan residents. As a Buddhist behavior, vegetarian diet highly approximates to be protective for Tibetan hypertension. As another Buddhist behavior, longer Buddhist activity participation time is associated with decreased prevalence of hypertension as well as lower blood pressure (BP) by analyzing subgroup of 570 Buddhists. Therefore, the protective role of religion on hypertension is suggested, and the religious behaviors are mediators which may be applied to general population.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies suggest sedentary behavior (SB) is a risk factor for hypertension. However, buddhist activities related to SB in Tibetan monks is quite different from common SB. Meditation, chanting, and buddhist teaching are the main features during sitting. There is no study to examine the association between buddhist activities related to sitting and hypertension. There were 594 Tibetan monks included for analysis. Buddhist activities related to SB involve hours of meditation, chanting, and buddhist teaching for a typical weekday and weekend day. After controlling potential risk factors, compared with Tibetan monks who has the sedentary time\u2009<\u20098\u2009h/d, those with 10\u2009h/d\u2009\u2264\u2009sedentary time\u2009<\u200911\u2009h/d was associated with about 80% decrease in the risk of hypertension (OR\u2009=\u20090.22;95% CI\u2009=\u20090.07-0.71), and about 90% decrease (OR\u2009=\u20090.11; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.03-0.40) in those with sedentary time\u2009\u2265\u200911\u2009h/d.

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a major global health concern. Recent evidence suggests that inflammation may play a role in the development of this disease. Therefore, immune system markers could serve as prognostic biomarkers for diabetes. The aim of the study was to examine whether white blood cell (WBC) count could predict diabetes incidence in the general Chinese population during a 15-year follow-up. Data were collected in 1992 and again in 2007 from 687 individuals. Questionnaire, physical examination, and laboratory tests were performed using a standardized protocol. To assess the effects of baseline WBC count on the onset of diabetes, Cox\u2019s proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios, and the area under the receiver-operating curve assessed the discriminatory power of anthropometric measures for diabetes. Seventy-four individuals were diagnosed with diabetes during the 15-year follow-up period (incidence: 10.8 %). Time of onset was 11.2 \u00b1 3.8 years. Increased WBC count increased diabetes risk during the follow-up after adjusting for other potential risk factors (P = 0.041). The areas under the receiver-operating curves for WBC count did not significantly predict incident diabetes better than traditional risk factors such as body mass index (BMI) in the general population cohort both at 7\u20138-year (area under curve (AUC) = 0.06, 95 % CI \u22120.162\u20130.282, P = 0.597) and 15-year follow-up (AUC = 0.1, 95 % CI 0.006\u20130.205, P = 0.065). An increasing WBC count increases the risk of type 2 diabetes incidence. Yet, it was an inappropriate predictor of diabetes in a middle-aged Chinese population compared to traditional risk factors such as BMI.",

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify lncRNA PEG10 expression levels in HSCC tumor tissues samples, para-carcinoma tissue samples and the HSCC FaDu cell line. Cell proliferation assays, Transwell invasion assays and wound healing assays were used to evaluate the effects of lncRNA PEG10 on FaDu cells . In 56 eligible patients, lncRNA PEG10 was expressed at higher levels in HSCC tumor tissues compared with para-carcinoma tissues, and significant associations were observed between increased tumor expression of lncRNA PEG10 and primary tumor size, lymph node status and tumor node metastasis stage. In the  experimental studies, enhanced expression of lncRNA PEG10 was significantly associated with increased proliferation, invasion and metastasis of FaDu cells. lncRNA PEG10 was upregulated in HSCC, and its overexpression in HSCC cells promoted an increase in the tumorigenic activities of proliferation, invasion and migration. The potential underlying mechanisms require investigation in future studies.",

The PLT is easy and quick to perform and it is suitable for samples with irregular shapes and therefore has found wide applications. The measured point-load strength (PLS) is considered as a strength index and it has been correlated to the rock compressive strength. To address the engineering applications where the loading is dynamic, the PLT is extended to its dynamic version in this study. The dynamic loading is exerted to the rock specimen using a split Hopkinson pressure bar system. Two conical steel platens are attached to the incident bar and transmitted bar, respectively, to apply the point load to the disc specimen. To enable quasi-static analysis, the pulse shaper technique is utilized to achieve the dynamic force balance. The flexibility of the dynamic PLT method is demonstrated by the application to a well-studied granitic rock-Laurentian granite. The correlation between the dynamic PLS and the dynamic strength of the same rock is established.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The failure of rock bridges between two adjacent discontinuities in rock masses often develops as Mode II fracture (sliding mode). Although a few methods have been proposed to quantify Mode II fracture toughness of rocks under the static loading condition, no method is available to measure dynamic Mode II fracture toughness of rocks. This paper presents a punch-through shear (PTS) method to measure such material parameter of rocks. In this method, circular notches are drilled 10\u00a0mm deep at both ends of a 50\u00a0mm diameter cylinder with 30\u00a0mm length to obtain the fracture specimen. A split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system is used to exert the dynamic load to the rock specimen, which is placed in a specially designed holder. The sample holder allows the punch head to load the sample directly and in combination with momentum-trap technique in SHPB, it also enables soft recovery of the rock short rod and rock hollow cylinder produced by punching. Pulse shaping technique is used in all dynamic SHPB tests to facilitate dynamic force equilibrium, under which condition finite element method is employed to obtain equations calculating Mode II fracture toughness. The application to an isotropic and fine-grained Fangshan marble demonstrates the flexibility and applicability of the proposed method. The dynamic Mode II fracture pattern and modes of the rock are analyzed using the X-ray Micro-CT technique. The results show that the failure of the rock specimen is shear dominant and the Mode II fracture toughness increases with the loading rate.",

Influences of thermally induced damage on the dynamic fracture toughness of concretes are thus significant to the safety design of concrete structures. We study the effect of thermally induced damage on the dynamic fracture toughness of two mortars. The notched semi-circular bend (NSCB) specimens were heat-treated at 150\u00a0\u00b0C, 250\u00a0\u00b0C, 350\u00a0\u00b0C, 450\u00a0\u00b0C and 600\u00a0\u00b0C, and then tested at room temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C with a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) apparatus. Before the dynamic fracture tests, X-ray Computer Tomography (CT) scanning was utilized to quantify the thermally induced micro-cracks and chemical changes of two mortars in terms of the CT value. In addition, densities and P-wave velocities of two mortars were also measured. The CT value, density and P-wave velocity decrease with the increase of the heat-treatment temperature, which can be attributed to the evolution of micro-structures due to the undesirable chemical reactions and the increase of micro-cracks. The results of dynamic tests show that the dynamic fracture toughness increases with the loading rates and deceases with the heat-treatment temperatures. The thermally induced damage is a combination of (a) the thermally induced micro-cracks and various chemical changes (which is characterized by the CT value), and (b) the deterioration of the binding property of reaction products. Thus the damage variable is introduced to represent the thermally induced damage for two mortars. A formula for describing the dependence of the dynamic fracture toughness on the loading rate effect and the thermal effect is developed by using the damage variable.

        "abstract": "Cohesion and internal friction angle are the two material parameters used in the Coulomb model to predict rock failure in many rock engineering applications. Although these two parameters have been extensively quantified under static conditions using the direct shear or the triaxial compression methods, the effect of dynamic loading on these parameters is not yet clear. A dynamic punch shear method was proposed by Huang et al. (Rev Sci Instrum 82:053901. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3585983, 2011) to measure the dynamic cohesion of rocks, and the dependence of cohesion on the loading rate has been revealed. To further investigate the effect of dynamic loading on the internal friction angle and thus the complete dynamic shear response of rocks, this method is extended in this study to include the normal stress by applying lateral confinement to a disc specimen. The confinement is realized by enclosing the specimen assembly in a 1.5 inch diameter Hoek cell. The dynamic load is applied by a split Hopkinson pressure bar system, which is modified to ensure that the specimen assembly remains intact in the Hoek cell during pressurization by applying a static axial pre-stress. Three groups of green sandstone specimens under confinements of 0, 10 and 20 MPa are tested with different loading rates. The results show that the dynamic shear strength exhibits significant rate dependency and it thus increases with the loading rate and the normal stress. The dynamic cohesion increases with the loading rate, while the internal friction angle remains constant.",

A mechanical model considering the stiffness characteristics of joints was proposed, the criterion of eccentric states and bearing stages was established to analyse the influence on the stability of single-layer latticed domes. Results indicate that the practical initial stiffness formulas proposed fit well with the theoretical solutions. The mechanical model can accurately simulate the stiffness characteristics and bearing stages of joints in the failure process of structure. Compared with the experimental results, the average error of mechanical model for the initial slope of load-rotation curve is 8%, and the average error for the ultimate bearing capacity is 7%. The stiffness degeneration of the joints in the plastic stage may cause a significant reduction in stability capacity of the structure.

Structural integrity and progressive collapse\u2013resisting capacity are gradually becoming essential requirements in structural design. The Kiewitt Lamella and geodesic single-layer latticed domes are typical of domes used in large-scale public facilities. In this paper, an experimental study and a numerical simulation were carried out to understand the mechanism of internal force redistribution in the progressive collapse of domes. Three effective methods to evaluate progressive collapse resistance and critical displacement were determined and verified. The results indicate that both the Kiewitt Lamella dome and the geodesic dome exhibit undergo snap-through collapse. The collapse of the Kiewitt Lamella dome was induced by unexpected local instability around the initial failure members, whereas that of the geodesic dome was the result of a rapid change in nodal displacement and a sharp decline in structural stiffness.",

To satisfy the boundary conditions on the free surface, Green\u2019s functions of compressional and shear wave sources in a poroelastic half-space are derived based on Biot\u2019s theory. It is verified that the IBIEM has great accuracy and numerical stability. Then, the influences of the drainage boundary condition, incident wave frequency, porosity, and cavity spacing on the dynamic responses are investigated by numerical examples. The results show that the amplification effect of the twin cavities is greater in the case of undrained boundary conditions, lower frequencies, and smaller cavity spacings. The porosity of the saturated medium also influences the dynamic responses because the velocity of the Rayleigh wave will change with the porosity of the saturated medium.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To satisfy the demand for assembled construction of single-layer reticulated domes, a novel Assembled Hub (AH) joint with good mechanical performance and economic benefit is introduced in this paper. Two available connection types are developed to satisfy different engineering requirements. The theoretical solutions of the elastic stiffness and the bearing capacity of the new joint system are proposed based on the component method. A series of bending tests were conducted to investigate the failure mechanism of AH joints, and the FE analysis was carried out to simulate and verify the mechanical behaviors of AH joints. Finally, the strengthening effects of two kinds of stiffeners are carefully compared and discussed. The results indicate that the AH joints type I show excellent ductility in the loading process. The failure of joints is caused by the plastic instability of the hub or the excessive plastic deformation of the closure plate. The plastic moment resistance of joint is determined by the thickness, height, outer diameter and material of the hub, as well as the bolts pitch. By contract, the AH joints type II display lower ductility but higher bearing capacities in the loading process. The failure mode is the connection failure. The ring stiffeners have a better strengthening effect than the radial stiffeners. A comparison between the computations and the experiments highlights the validity of the suggested bearing capacity formulas, which can be further used to guide the joint design.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT   In this study, the mechanical performances of assembled hub (AH) joints under axial loads are investigated. Firstly, analytical solutions for the load-deformation characteristics of the AH joint system are proposed based on the rigid foundation-beam assumption. Axial tension and compression tests as well as finite element analysis are conducted to reveal the failure modes of AH joints with different design parameters. Moreover, a design method for AH joints is proposed to guide engineering applications. The type I AH joints exhibited three failure modes during the tension test: hub punching failure, hub fracture, and excessive deformation of the closure plate. Comparatively, the failure of joints was mainly caused by excessive hub deformation during the compression test. The initial stiffness and plastic capacity of the AH joints under two loading cases were identical. However, after entering the plastic phase, the tensile stiffness of the joints increased steadily, while the compressional stiffness declined with the plastic deformation. The type II AH joints exhibited brittle failure during the test. The initial stiffness and axial capacities obtained from the theoretical analysis agree strongly with the experimental results. The proposed theoretical formulae are useful for preliminary estimation of the mechanical performances of a new joint system.",

The thermal damage induced by various heat-treatment temperatures (150, 250, 350, 450, 600 and 850 \u00b0C) is first characterized by X-ray Micro-computed tomography (CT) method. The damage variable derived from the average CT value for heat-treated LS specimen and reference specimen without heat treatment was used to quantify the thermal damage. The dynamic tensile strengths of these LS samples under different dynamic loading rates (ranging from 24 to 540 GPa/s) were then obtained using the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system. The dynamic tensile strength of LS increases with the loading rate at a given heat-treatment temperature, and the tensile strength at the same loading rate decreases with the heat-treatment temperature except for 450 \u00b0C. Based on the experimental data, an empirical equation was established to relate the dynamic tensile strength of LS to the loading rate and the heat-treatment temperature.",

        "abstract": "The numerical manifold method (NMM) features its dual cover systems, namely the mathematical cover and physical cover, which provide a unified framework for mechanics problems involving continuum and discontinuum deformation. Uniform finite element meshes can be and are usually used to construct the mathematical cover. Though this strategy can handle different kinds of problems in a unified way, it is not economical for cases with steep deformation gradients or singularities. In this paper, using the recovery-based error estimator, an h-adaptive NMM on quadtree meshes is proposed to deal with such cases. The quadtree meshes serve as the mathematical meshes, on which the local refinement is carried out. When the quadtree meshes are refined, the corresponding mathematical cover, physical cover and manifold elements are updated accordingly. To handle the hanging nodes in the quadtree meshes, we resort to mean value coordinates. Comparing to the refinement based on manifold elements, the proposed strategy guarantees consistent structured meshes throughout the adaptive process, thus retaining the unique feature of original NMM. In contrast with polygonal finite element method, an advantage of the proposed method is that the meshes do not need to conform to the crack face and material boundary, which means the adaptive NMM is very suitable for problems with complex geometric boundary. Several representative mechanics problems, including crack problems, are analyzed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is demonstrated that the proposed adaptive NMM has higher accuracy and better performance comparing to uniform refinement strategy.",

        "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Despite the anticancer capabilities of emodin observed in many cancers, including EOC, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. A crucial link has been discovered between the acquisition of metastatic traits and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The present study aimed to determine whether emodin could inhibit the EMT of EOC cells and explore the underlying mechanism. The CCK-8 assay and transwell assay showed that emodin effectively repressed the abilities of proliferation, invasion, and migration in A2780 and SK-OV-3 cells. The Western blot showed that emodin upregulated epithelial markers (E-cadherin and Claudin) while it downregulated mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and Vimentin) and transcription factor (Slug) in a dose-dependent fashion. After transfection of siRNA-Slug, both Slug and N-cadherin were downregulated in EOC cells while E-cadherin was upregulated, which was intensified by emodin. Besides, emodin decreased the expression of ILK, p-GSK-3, -catenin, and Slug. Transfection of siRNA-ILK also achieved the same effects, which was further strengthened by following emodin treatment. Nevertheless, SB216763, an inhibitor of GSK-3, could reverse the effects of emodin except for ILK expression. These findings suggest that emodin inhibited the EMT of EOC cells via ILK/GSK-3/Slug signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To determine whether emodin facilitates the mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition (MET) of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) as well as to explore the mechanism through which emodin favored the MET of ESCs.Methods:Cell viability was tested by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. Cell migration and invasion abilities were detected by transwell assays. Levels of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were detected by Western blot.Results:Upregulated ILK and increased abilities of migration and invasion were confirmed in the eutopic and ectopic ESCs (EuSCs and EcSCs), especially in the EcSCs. After treated with emodin, the expression of ILK was statistically downregulated in EcSCs, resulting in the MET and decreased migration and invasion abilities of EcSCs. Additionally, silencing of the ILK gene in EcSCs also achieved the above-mentioned effects, which were strengthened by emodin. Furthermore, exogenous expression of ILK in control ESCs (CSCs) resulted...",

Development of these drugs has stalled due to dose-limiting side effects of nausea and emesis. While use of subtype-selective inhibitors (i.e., for PDE4A, B, or D) could overcome this issue, conservation of the catalytic region, to which classical inhibitors bind, limits this approach. The present study examined the effects of BPN14770, an allosteric inhibitor of PDE4D, which binds to a primate-specific, N-terminal region. In mice engineered to express PDE4D with this primate-specific sequence, BPN14770 was 100-fold more potent for improving memory than in wild-type mice; meanwhile, it exhibited low potency in a mouse surrogate model for emesis. BPN14770 also antagonized the amnesic effects of scopolamine, increased cAMP signaling in brain, and increased BDNF and markers of neuronal plasticity associated with memory. These data establish a relationship between PDE4D target engagement and effects on memory for BPN14770 and suggest clinical potential for PDE4D-selective inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) plays an important role in treatment of stress-related depression through regulation of antioxidant defense and neuroprotective mechanisms. However, the causal relationship between PDE2 and the prevalence of depression and anxiety upon exposure to oxidative stress has not been investigated. The present study examined whether the effects of PDE2 inhibition on oxidative stress were directly involved in reduced ROS by regulating NADPH subunits gp91phox oxidase. The results suggested that the PDE2 inhibitor Bay 60-7550 reversed oxidative stress-induced behavioral signature, i.e. depression and anxiety. Pretreatment with the oxidizing agent DTNB completely blocked, while the reducing agent DTT and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin potentiated the effects of Bay 60-7550 on behavioral abnormalities, demonstrating the relationship between PDE2 and oxidative stress. Consistently, an in vitro test revealed the positive correlation between ROS and PDE2 levels. Moreover, Bay 60-7550 decreased corticosterone-induced gp91phox expression, which is the source of ROS. The subsequent study suggested that Bay 60-7550 induced decrease in ROS and increase in cAMP/cGMP, pVASP, pCREB, and the neurotrophic factor BDNF levels, which were completely blocked by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gp91phox overexpression and potentiated by gp91phox siRNA-based antioxidant strategies. The in vivo test in stressed mice further suggested that gp91phox overexpression completely blocked the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of Bay 60-7550, while gp91phox knockdown enhanced such effects. These results provide solid evidence that the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of Bay 60-7550 against stress are causally related to down-regulation of gp91phox and activation of the cAMP/cGMP-pVASP-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway.",

Beta amyloid peptides (A\u03b2) are known to involve cognitive impairment, neuroinflammatory and apoptotic processes in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Activation of cAMP and/or cGMP activities can improve memory performance and decrease the neuroinflammation and apoptosis. However, it remains unknown whether the memory enhancing effect of resveratrol on AD associated cognitive disorders is related to the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) subtypes and subsequent increases in intracellular cAMP and/or cGMP activities. This study investigated the effect of resveratrol on A\u03b21-42-induced cognitive impairment and the participation of PDE4 subtypes related cAMP or cGMP signaling. Mice microinfused with A\u03b21-42 into bilateral CA1 subregions displayed learning and memory impairment, as evidenced by reduced memory acquisition and retrieval in the water maze and retention in the passive avoidance tasks; it was also significant that neuroinflammatory and pro-apoptotic factors were increased in A\u03b21-42-treated mice. A\u03b21-42-treated mice also increased in PDE4A, 4B and 4D expression, and decreased in PKA level. However, PKA inhibitor H89, but not PKG inhibitor KT5823, prevented resveratrol\u2019s effects on these parameters. Resveratrol also reversed A\u03b21-42-induced decreases in phosphorylated cAMP response-element binding protein (pCREB), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anti-apoptotic factor BCl-2 expression, which were reversed by H89. These findings suggest that resveratrol reversing A\u03b2-induced learning and memory disorder may involve the regulation of neuronal inflammation and apoptosis  via  PDE4 subtypes related cAMP-CREB-BDNF signaling.",

        "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2 mediates development of the neurogenic niche of excitatory neurons, suggesting the possibility that its inactivation plays a role in neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and memory impairment. While N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is involved in regulating memory formation and neurogenesis in adult animal, it remains unclear how NMDA receptor subtypes mediate depression and cognitive deficits caused by EphB2 loss. The present study shows that EphB2 inactivation results in depression-like behaviors, memory impairment and defects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Compared to wild-type littermates, EphB2 KO mice exhibited depression-like behavior and deficits in spatial memory and cognition in forced swimming, tail suspension, Morris water maze, object recognition test and object location test. These behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by substantial decreases in the number of BrdU+ progenitor neurons, phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (pCREB) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and increased NMDA receptor 2B (NR2B) expression. These molecular, cellular and behavioral alterations induced by EphB2 inactivation were reversed by NR2B antagonist Ro25-6981, suggesting that EphB2 functions to prevent the progression of depression-like behavior and memory impairment by downregulating NR2B. Our findings highlight that NR2B is responsible for EphB2-dependent behavioral and morphological changes. EphB2 may thus be as an important candidate target for treating psychiatric and cognitive disorders.",

Docking simulation was performed to insert compound 6s into the crystal structure of PDE2 at the active site to determine the binding mode. Furthermore, compound 6s significantly protected HT-22 cells against corticosterone-induced cytotoxicity and rescued corticosterone-induced decreases in cAMP and cGMP levels.

The present study investigated the effects of PDE4 inhibitor rolipram on A\u03b21-42-induced cognitive dysfunction and its underlying mechanisms. The step-down passive avoidance (PA) and Morris water-maze (MWM) tests were conducted 1 week (1 W), 2 months (2 M), and 6 months (6 M) after intracerebroventricular microjection (i.c.v.) of A\u03b21-42. The results suggested that memory impairment emerged as early as 1 W, peaked at 2 M, and lasted until 6 M after injection. Chronic treatment with rolipram (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mg/kg/d, i.p.) for 2 weeks (i.e., treatment started at 1.5 months after A\u03b21-42 microinjection) dose-dependently improved memory performance in both MWM and PA tests. Moreover, rolipram reversed the A\u03b2-induced increases in serum corticosterone (CORT), corticotropin-releasing factor, and glucocorticoid receptors (CRF-R and GR) levels, whereas it decreases in brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and the ratio of pCREB to CREB expression. These effects of rolipram were prevented by pre-treatment with PKA inhibitor H89. The findings indicated that the protective effects of rolipram against A\u03b21-42-induced memory deficits might involve HPA axis and cAMP-CREB-BDNF signaling.",

        "abstract": "Stress can act as a precipitation factor in the onset of emotional disorders, particularly depression. Trans-resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound enriched in polygonum cuspidatum and has been found to exert antidepressant-like effects in our previous studies. In present study, we assessed the effects of trans-resveratrol used in combination with piperine, commonly known as a bioavailability enhancer, on chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depressive-like behaviors and relevant molecular targets. Trans-resveratrol used alone reduced the immobility time of rats in the forced swimming test, with the maximal effects of trans-resveratrol around 60\u00a0% inhibition at the highest dose tested, 40\u00a0mg/kg. However, when a subthreshold dose of piperine, 2.5\u00a0mg/kg was used in combination with trans-resveratrol, the minimum effective dose of trans-resveratrol in reducing the immobility time was reduced to 20\u00a0mg/kg. Further evidence from neurochemical (monoamines in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus), biochemical (monoamine oxidase, MAO activities) and molecular biological (cAMP, PKA, CREB and BDNF) assays supported the findings in the behavioral studies. These results suggest that the co-treatment strategy with trans-resveratrol and piperine might be an alternative therapy that provides efficacious protection against chronic stress. ",

        "abstract": "Neuropathic pain can be considered as a form of chronic stress that may share common neuropathological mechanism between pain and stress-related depression and respond to similar treatment. Ferulic acid (FA) is a major active component of angelica sinensis and has been reported to exert antidepressant-like effects; however, it remains unknown whether FA ameliorate chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain and the involvement of descending monoaminergic system and opioid receptors. Chronic treatment with FA (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) ameliorated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in von Frey hair and hot plate tasks, accompanied by increasing spinal noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) levels. Subsequent study suggested that treatment of CCI animals with 40 and 80 mg/kg FA also inhibited spinal MAO-A levels. FA's effects on mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesiawas blocked by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) via pharmacological depletion of spinal noradrenaline or serotonin. Moreover, the anti-allodynic action of FA on mechanical stimuli was prevented by pre-treatment with beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, or by the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole. While the anti-hyperalgesia on thermal stimuli induced by FA was blocked by pre-treatment with 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635, or with the irreversible mu-opioid receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine. These results suggest that the effect of FA on neuropathic pain is potentially mediated via amelioration of the descending monoaminergic system that coupled with spinal beta2- and 5-HT1A receptors and the downstream delta- and mu-opioid receptors differentially.

        "abstract": "Resveratrol has been widely studied in terms of it's potential to slow the progression of many diseases. But little is known about the mechanism of action in neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is the main type of chronic pain associated with tissue injury. Calcium channels and calcium/caffeine-sensitive pools are associated with analgesic pathway involving neuropathic pain. Our previous study suggested that the antinociceptive effect of resveratrol was involved in Ca/calmodulin-dependent signaling in the spinal cord of mice. The aim of this study was to explore the involvement of Ca in analgesic effects of trans-resveratrol in neuropathic pain and signal pathway in hippocampus. Hot plate test was used to assess antinociceptive response when mice were treated with trans-resveratrol alone or in combination with Mk 801, nimodipine, CaCl, ryanodine or EGTA. The effects of trans-resveratrol and the combination on Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) expression in hippocampus were also investigated. The results showed that trans-resveratrol increased paw withdraw latency in the hot plate test. The effect of resveratrol was enhanced by Mk 801 and nimodipine. Central administration of Ca, however, abolished the antinociceptive effects of resveratrol. In contrast, centrally administered EGTA or ryanodine improved trans-resveratrol induced antinociception. There was a significant increase in p-CaMKII and BDNF expression in the hippocampus when resveratrol were combined with Mk 801, nimodipine, ryanodine and EGTA. Administration of CaCl blocked changes in p-CaMKII and BDNF levels in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that trans-resveratrol exerts the effects of antinociception through regulation of calcium channels and calcium/caffeine-sensitive pools.",

        "abstract": "Depression is a dysthymia disorder characterized by a pervasive or persistent mental disorder that causes mood, cognitive and memory deficits. J147, a curcumin analogue, increases brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and facilitates memory in animals. Because curcumin has the antidepressant-like activity, the present study investigated the potential antidepressant-like effects of J147 in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension tests (TST) and the involvement of 5-HT receptors related to cAMP signaling. The results suggested that acute treatment of J147 at doses of 5 and 10\u202fmg/kg via gavage markedly reduced the duration of immobility in both TST and FST, either 1\u202fh or 3\u202fh after treatment, respectively. It did not alter locomotor activity but influence the immobile response. The molecular biological assays showed that 5-HT receptor expression was significantly increased at 1\u202fh after treatment with J147 at a dose of 10\u202fmg/kg. In addition, pre-treatment of mice with WAY-100635 blocked the J147's effect in the FST. 5-HT receptor expression was not significantly increased with increasing doses of J147. The 5-HT receptors antagonist isamoltan partially prevented J147's effect in the FST. The levels of downstream molecular targets, cAMP, PKA, pCREB and BDNF were significantly increased 1\u202fh after treatment with J147 at doses of 5 and 10\u202fmg/kg. The up-regulated pCREB and BDNF levels lasted for 3\u202fh after 10\u202fmg/kg of J147. These findings demonstrated that J147 has antidepressant-like effects that are mediated, at least in part, by activating the 5-HT/cAMP/PKA/CREB/BDNF-signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Major depression is characterized by dysfunction of neuroendocrine and immune networks. Trans-resveratrol, a phenolic compound presented in polygonum cuspidatum, was demonstrated previously to exert antidepressant-like effects through regulating monoaminergic system, oxidative/antioxidant defense and inflammatory response. The present study investigated the synergistic antidepressant-like effect of trans-resveratrol and piperine, a bioavailability enhancer, in mice and explored the possible mechanism. Trans-resveratrol was shown to reduce the immobility time both in the tail suspension and forced swimming tests (TST and FST). But the maximal inhibition was nearly 60% even if the doses were increased by 160 mg/kg; while piperine produced weak antidepressant-like effects in these two models. The interaction between trans-resveratrol and piperine was shown a clear-cut synergistic effect as evidenced by an isobolographic analysis. The further study suggested that the anti-immobility response from the subthreshold dose of piperine (2.5 mg/kg) and low doses of trans-resveratrol (10 and 20 mg/kg) was abolished by pretreatment with para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 300 mg/kg, i.p.) in TST and FST, indicating the involvement of serotonergic system. Moreover, treatment with the subthreshold dose of piperine and low doses of trans-resveratrol attenuated reserpine-induced hypothermia and ptosis arguing for the relevance of noradrenaline. Additional evidence from neurochemical (monoamines in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus) and biochemical (monoamine oxidase, MAO activity) assays corroborated the synergistically elevated monoaminergic system after co-treatment with trans-resveratrol and piperine. The present results indicate the effect of trans-resveratrol combined with piperine on depressive-like behaviors may be partly due to the potentiated activation of monoaminergic system in the brain. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the involvement of the oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammatory and neuroprotective pathway in the antidepressant-like effect of this combination. The synergistic effect obtained from the combination may provide innovative clues for designing novel antidepressants with high efficacy and low side effects.",

        "abstract": "The lifetime prevalence rate for major depressive disorder (MDD) is approximately 17\u00a0% for most developed countries around the world. Dietary polyphenols are currently used as an adjuvant therapy to accelerate the therapeutic efficacy on depression. Ferulic acid (FA) or 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-cinnamic acid (Fig. 1a) is a main polyphenolic component of Chinese herb Radix Angelicae Sinensis, which is found to have antidepressant-like effects through regulating serotonergic and noradrenergic function. The present study examined the synergistic effect of low doses of FA combined with subthreshold dose of piperine, a bioavailability enhancer, on depression-like behaviors in mice, and investigated the possible mechanism. The administration of FA, even in the highest dose tested, reduced immobility time by 60\u00a0% in the tail suspension and forced swimming tests (TST and FST) in mice when compared to control. The maximal antidepressant-like effect of FA was obtained with 200\u00a0mg/kg. In addition, piperine only produced a weak antidepressant-like effect in the TST and FST. However, the evidence from the interaction analysis suggested a synergistic effect when low doses of FA were combined with a subthreshold dose of piperine. Further neurochemical evidence such as monoamine levels in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus and measurements of monoamine oxidase activity also supported a synergistic effect of FA and piperine in the enhancement of monoaminergic function. This finding supports the concept that the combination strategy might be an alternative therapy in the treatment of psychiatric disorders with high efficacy and low side effects.",

        "abstract": "Dopaminergic (DA) neurons derived from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) maybe a valuable source for cell replacement therapy in Parkinson disease. Recent studies showed that new functions of LXR and their ligands have been proposed to prevent PD in the adult nervous system. The present study was designed to observe the effect of liver X receptors (LXR) agonist on differentiation of rat BMSCs into DA neurons. Expressions of the neuronal markers (Tuj1 and Nestin), the specific marker of DA neurons (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH), LXR \u03b1 and LXR \u03b2 were measured by immunocytochemical assay and TH/Tuj1 positive cells were determined by quantitative cell count analyses. mRNA expressions of LXR \u03b1, LXR \u03b2, TH, DAT, Nurr1, Pitx3, En1 and Lmx1b were measured by qPCR. Compared with growth factors (GF) treated group, combined use of LXR and GF induced rat BMSCs to TH-expressing cells with 87.42% of efficiency in 6 days of period of induction. LXR agonist alone did not induce the differentiation. Compared with GF alone, combined use of LXR and GF increased expressions of LXR \u03b1 and LXR \u03b2 protein and mRNA and TH, DAT, Nurr1, and Pitx3 mRNA, decreased expressions of En1 and Lmx1b mRNA. Our experimental results indicated that LXR activation leads to improve induction efficiency and shorten induction period of rat BMSCs into DA neuron-like cells through regulating DA development-related genes expressions and that LXR can be considered as a candidate target for drug development to improve differentiation of BMSCs into DA neurons.",

        "abstract": "Our previous studies indicated that adapentpronitrile, a new adamantane-based dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor, has a hypoglycemic effect and ameliorates rat pancreatic \u03b2 cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus through inhibiting DPP-IV activity. However, the effect of adapentpronitrile on the neurodegenerative diseases has not been studied. In the present study, we first found that adapentpronitrile significantly ameliorated neuronal injury and decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta (A\u03b2) expression in the hippocampus and cortex in the high fat diet/STZ rat model of diabetes. Furthermore, adapentpronitrile significantly attenuated oxidative stress, downregulated expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX, cytochrome c, caspase-9, and caspase-3, and upregulated expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, although there was no effect on GLP-1R expression. At 30 min post-injection of adapentpronitrile (50 mg/kg)  the tail vein, its concentration in normal rat brain was 0.2034 \u00b1 0.0094 \u03bcg/g. Subsequently, we further confirmed the neuroprotective effects and mechanism of adapentpronitrile in HT22 cells treated with high glucose (HG) and aluminum maltolate [Al(mal)] overload, respectively. Our results showed significant decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential (MTP) and Bcl-2 expression, accompanied by a significant increase in apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins in HT22 cells exposed to these stimuli. Adapentpronitrile treatment protected against neuronal injury, suppressed ROS generation, and reduced MTP and mitochondrial apoptosis in HT22 cells; however, DPP-IV activity was not detected. Our results suggest that adapentpronitrile protects against diabetic neuronal injury, at least partially, by inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative stress and the apoptotic pathway in a DPP-IV-independent manner.",

        "abstract": "Diabetics often face greater risk of cognitive impairment than non-diabetics. However, how to prevent this disease is still unconfirmed. In this study, we investigated the potential protection and mechanism of meloxicam on cognitive impairment in diabetic rats. Diabetic rat model was established with high-fat diet and a small dose of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg). The changes of spatial learning and memory, histopathology and the protein expressions of amyloid protein precursor (APP) and \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) indicated that diabetic rats had neuronal injury and cognitive impairment. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), C reactive protein (CRP) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels and microglial cell number were significantly increased in the diabetic rat brain. Meanwhile, the protein expressions of APP, A\u03b2, cyclooxygenases2 (COX2), E-type prostanoid recptors 1 (EP1) and EP2, and the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were significantly increased, while the protein expressions of EP3 and phosphorylated protein kinase A (pPKA) were significantly decreased in the diabetic rat hippocampus and cortex. However, the EP4 protein expression had no significant changes. Meloxicam significantly improved neuronal injury and cognitive impairment, and significantly decreased inflammatory cytokines levels. Meloxicam also significantly decreased the protein expressions of APP, A\u03b2, COX2, EP1 and EP2 and the level of cAMP, and significantly increased the EP3 and pPKA protein expressions in rat hippocampus and cortex. However, meloxicam did not significantly influence the levels of blood glucose, lipids and insulin of rats. Our results suggest that meloxicam could significantly protect diabetic rats from cognitive impairment via a mechanism that may be associated with rebalancing the COX2-PGE2-EPs-cAMP/PKA pathway.",

        "abstract": "The present study was designed to observe the effect of COX2/PGD2-related autophagy on brain injury in type 2 diabetes rats. The histopathology was detected by haematoxylin-eosin staining. The learning and memory functions were evaluated by Morris water maze. The levels of insulin and PGD2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expressions of COX2, p-AKT(S473), p-AMPK(T172), A\u03b2, Beclin1, LC3BII, and p62 were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. In model rats, we found that the body weight was significantly decreased, the blood glucose levels were significantly increased, the plasma insulin content was significantly decreased, the learning and memory functions were impaired and the cortex and hippocampus neurons showed significant nuclear pyknosis. The levels of COX2, p-AKT(S473), PGD2, A\u03b2, Beclin1 and p62 were significantly increased, whereas the expression of p-AMPK(T172) and LC3BII was significantly decreased in the cortex and hippocampus of model rats. In meloxicam-treated rats, the body weight, blood glucose and the content of plasma insulin did not significantly change, the learning and memory functions were improved and nuclear pyknosis was improved in the cortex and hippocampus neurons. The expression of p-AMPK(T172), Beclin1 and LC3BII was significantly increased, and the levels of COX2, p-AKT(S473), PGD2, A\u03b2, and p62 were significantly decreased in the cortex and hippocampus of meloxicam-treated rats. Our results suggested that the inhibition of COX2/PGD2-related autophagy was involved in the mechanism of brain injury caused by type 2 diabetes in rats.",

Telocyte existed in most organs and tissues in humans and animals. However, few studies have examined telocytes in ApoE gene deficient mice. In our studies, we verified the existence, the morphology and immunohistochemical characteristics of telocytes in critical organs of the ApoE mice. Male adult ApoE mice were selected as an experimental model. Immunohistochemical bio-markers, such as CD34, CD117, CD28, Vimentin and PDGFR-\u03b1 were utilized to determine the distribution and morphology of telocytes in the heart, liver and kidney. Telocyte expressed positively for CD34 and CD117, and partial telocyte and telopode expressed positively for PDGFR-\u03b1 in heart and liver, but negatively in kidney. Double immunofluorescence assays for CD28/Vimentin, CD34/CD117 and CD34/PDGFR-\u03b1 were used to demonstrate the biochemistry speciality of telocytes, respectively. The evidence of telocytes in the ApoE mice is the first step of our sturdy, which aims to demonstrate changes in telocytes in atherosclerosis in this animal model.",

Among them, chloronitrobenzenes have been reported to be degraded by several bacterial strains. However, till date, the biodegradation of bromonitrobenzenes has not been reported for any pure bacterial culture. In this study, 2-bromonitrobenzene was found to be utilized by the 2-chloronitrobenzene utilizer  Pseudomonas stutzeri  ZWLR2-1 as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy for growth, with nitrite release. The nitroaromatic dioxygenase CnbAaAbAcAd from strain ZWLR2-1 converted 2-bromonitrobenzene to 3-bromocatechol with concomitant nitrite release. CnbC exhibited 3-bromocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase activity. The identity of 3-bromocatechol was confirmed by Liquid Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS), in comparison with authentic 3-bromocatechol. These results demonstrated that the  cnb  cluster of  Pseudomonas stutzeri  ZWLR2-1 is responsible for the biodegradation of both 2-chloronitrobenzene and 2-bromonitrobenzene, providing yet another example of a bacterium having rapidly evolved a pathway to utilize multiple xenobiotics.",

        "abstract": "The NIH shift is a chemical rearrangement in which a substituent on an aromatic ring undergoes an intramolecular migration, primarily during an enzymatic hydroxylation reaction. The molecular mechanism for the NIH shift of a carboxyl group has remained a mystery for forty years. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism of the reaction in the conversion of para-hydroxybenzoate (PHB) to gentisate (GA, 2, 5-dihydroxybenzoate). Three genes (phgABC) from the PHB utilizer Brevibacillus laterosporous PHB-7a encode enzymes (p-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA ligase, p-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA hydroxylase and gentisyl-CoA thioesterase, respectively) catalyzing the conversion of PHB to GA via a route involving CoA thioester formation, hydroxylation concomitant with a 1, 2-shift of the acetyl CoA moiety and thioester hydrolysis. The shift of the carboxyl group was established rigorously by stable isotopic experiments with heterologously expressed phgABC, converting 2, 3, 5, 6-tetradeutero-PHB and [carboxyl- C]-PHB to 3, 4, 6-trideutero-GA and [carboxyl- C]-GA, respectively. This is distinct from the NIH shifts of hydrogen and aceto substituents, where a single oxygenase catalyzes the reaction without involvement of a thioester. The discovery of this three-step strategy for carboxyl group migration reveals a novel role of the CoA thioester in biochemistry and also illustrates the diversity and complexity of microbial catabolism in the carbon cycle.

Bioaugmentation, defined as the introduction of specific competent strains or consortia of microorganisms, is a widely applied bioremediation technology for soil remediation. In this review, it is concluded which several successful studies of bioaugmentation of aromatics-contaminated soil by single strains or mixed consortia. In recent decades, a number of reports have been published on the metabolic machinery of aromatics degradation by microorganisms and their capacity to adapt to aromatics-contaminated environments. Thus, microorganisms are major players in site remediation. The bioremediation/bioaugmentation process relies on the immense metabolic capacities of microbes for transformation of aromatic pollutants into essentially harmless or, at least, less toxic compounds. Aromatics-contaminated soils are successfully remediated with adding not only single strains but also bacterial or fungal consortia. Furthermore several novel approaches, which microbes combined with physical, chemical or biological factors, increase remediation efficiency of aromatics-contaminated soil. Meanwhile, the environmental factors also have appreciable impacts on the bioaugmentation process. The biostatistics method is recommended for analysis of the effects of bioaugmentation treatments.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) has been receiving more and more attention in the past two decades. A lot of methods have been proposed and studied for radar target recognition. Among some of these methods, they use the supervised algorithms to extracts features. In this paper, we first use a unsupervised algorithm, K-means clustering, which can learn the features without known the class of training samples, for radar target recognition. As the unsupervised algorithm has a high demand on the scale of the data, so we proposed a method of data augmentation to get more data for the unsupervised algorithm, by which the K-means clustering algorithm can learn more unsupervised features. Experimental results on the MSTAR database show that the proposed method can achieve satisfying recognition accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",

Recently, deep learning methods, especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) has proven extremely competitive in image and speech recognition tasks. In this paper, a deep CNN model has been proposed for SAR automatic target recognition. The proposed deep model named SARnet, has two stage convolutional-pooling layers and two full-connected layers. Due to the demand of requirement of large scale of the data in deep learning, we proposed an augmentation method to get a large scale database for the training of CNN model, by which the CNN model can learn more useful features through the large scale database. Experimental results on the MSTAR database show the effectiveness of the proposed model and has achieved encouraging results with a correct recognition rate of 95.68%.",

However,the impact of pose variation and registration factors hasntbeen well solved. In practical system, single face with manuallyregistration is often adopted in the registration process. Butthere are some limitations in the single registered face image,and manually way of registration is not convenient for theusers. Also the recognition performance based on the singleface image matching is inevitably disturbed and restricted. Inpractical situation, more than one face images can be collected.Multiple image of the same person than a single image featurecan capture more intra variation information in the same class.Feature information of multiple images are introduced in therecognition matching, which will benefit to improve theaccuracy of face recognition. In this paper, a poseovercomplete automatic registration method is proposed tosolve this problem in the registration process. In the proposedmethod, we estimate the pose automatically in real-time byutilizing the detected landmarks information, with posevariation face images stored for matching templates.Experimental results show that the proposed method can notonly overcome the influence of the pose variation inrecognition, but also can solve the problem of non-ideal poseregistration, thus improve the recognition accuracy in practicalface recognition system.",

This paper discussed the possible formation mechanism and biological function of autapse connection on neurons. We believe that the formation and growth of autapse connected to neuron can be associated with injury on axon and blocking in signal transmission; thus auxiliary loop is developed to form an autapse. When autapse is set up, it can propagate the signals and change the modes of electrical activities under self-adaption. Based on the cable neuron model, the injury on axon is generated by poisoning and blocking in ion channels (of sodium); thus the conductance of ion channels are changed to form injury-associated defects. Furthermore, auxiliary loop with time delay is designed to restore and enhance signal propagation by setting different time delays and feedback gains. The numerical studies confirmed that appropriate time delay and feedback gain in electric or chemical autapse can help signal (or wave generated by external forcing) propagation across the blocked area. As a result, formation of autapse could be dependent on the injury of neuron and further enhances the self-adaption to external stimuli.",

Artificial networks with different topologies are often designed to reproduce the collective behaviors of nodes (or neurons) which the local kinetics of node is described by kinds of oscillator models. It is believed that the self-organization of network much depends on the bifurcation parameters and topology connection type. Indeed, the boundary effect is every important on the pattern formation of network. In this paper, a regular network of Hindmarsh\u2013Rose neurons is designed in a two-dimensional square array with nearest-neighbor connection type. The neurons on the boundary are excited with random stimulus. It is found that spiral waves, even a pair of spiral waves could be developed in the network under appropriate coupling intensity. Otherwise, the spatial distribution of network shows irregular states. A statistical variable is defined to detect the collective behavior by using mean field theory. It is confirmed that regular pattern could be developed when the synchronization degree is low. The potential mechanism could be that random perturbation on the boundary could induce coherence resonance-like behavior thus spiral wave could be developed in the network.",

Appropriate dynamical and functional responses can be observed in the sampled series for membrane potentials by setting different feedback modulation on the membrane potential in presence of electromagnetic radiation. The electromagnetic radiation is described by a periodical forcing on the magnetic flux, and it is found that the response frequency can keep pace with the frequency of external forcing. However, mismatch of frequency occurs by further increasing the frequency of external forcing, it could account for the information encoding of neuron. The dynamical response could be associated with the magnetization and polarization of the media, thus the outputs of membrane potential can become quiescent and/or bursting as well.",

Most of the neuron models mainly emphasize on the ion channel currents embedded into the membrane and the properties in electrical activities can be produced in the theoretical models. Indeed, some physical effect should be considered during the model setting for neuronal activities. In fact, induced current and the electrical field will cause the membrane potential to change and an exchange of charged ions during the fluctuation of ion concentration in cell. As a result, the effect of electromagnetic induction should be seriously considered. In this paper, magnetic flux is proposed to describe the effect of electromagnetic field, and the memristor is used to realize coupling on membrane by inputting induced current based on consensus of physical unit.

        "abstract": "Synapse coupling can benefit signal exchange between neurons and information encoding for neurons, and the collective behaviors such as synchronization and pattern selection in neuronal network are often discussed under chemical or electric synapse coupling. Electromagnetic induction is considered at molecular level when ion currents flow across the membrane and the ion concentration is fluctuated. Magnetic flux describes the effect of time-varying electromagnetic field, and memristor bridges the membrane potential and magnetic flux according to the dimensionalization requirement. Indeed, field coupling can contribute to the signal exchange between neurons by triggering superposition of electric field when synapse coupling is not available. A chain network is designed to investigate the modulation of field coupling on the collective behaviors in neuronal network connected by electric synapse between adjacent neurons. In the chain network, the contribution of field coupling from each neuron is described by introducing appropriate weight dependent on the position distance between two neurons. Statistical factor of synchronization is calculated by changing the external stimulus and weight of field coupling. It is found that the synchronization degree is dependent on the coupling intensity and weight, the synchronization, pattern selection of network connected with gap junction can be modulated by field coupling.",

In this paper, periodic forcing is imposed on some neurons of a two-dimensional square lattice with nearest-neighbor connection (the boundary of one side in the network of neurons), which the local kinetics of node is described by Hindmarsh-Rose neuron, while noise is imposed on another side of the two-dimensional lattice. Indeed, spiral waves can be developed in the side of the network driven by appropriate noise intensity while the another side is occupied by plane wave. A statistical factor of synchronization is defined to discern the occurrence of regularity induced by local noise and local pacing. The emitted plane wave from one side of network can be suppressed by noise and disordered state emerges with stronger noise being used on all nodes of the network, furthermore, spiral wave is induced in the network under appropriate noise intensity. The network shows spatial regularity when spiral wave is developed and it is interesting to find spiral wave can coexist with plane wave in the network. Stochastic resonance-like behavior could be observed in the two-dimensional lattice composed of neurons even if noise and periodic forcing are imposed on different areas of the network. The occurrence of spatial regularity under coherence could rely on the competition between noise driving-induced segments and wave fronts induced by periodic forcing.",

The discharge behavior of neurons induced by potassium ion and sodium ion channel blocks was analyzed by numerical simulation in the improved HH model. The results suggest that changes in the maximum conductance of potassium channels can cause spontaneous discharge behavior of neurons. The poisoning of potassium ion can be weakened by the electromagnetic radiation in the neural network, and the neural network presents a state of spatial order in the case of spiral waves. It is interesting that the ordered waveform is generated by no-flux boundary condition when the initial states are selected as wedge-shaped type in the network. In addition, potassium channel blocks can promote the discharge of neurons and facilitate the formation of spiral waves in the neural network. By contrast, the electrical activity of neurons is inhibited by sodium channel blocks. The influence of membrane patch size on the electrical activity of single neuron is greater than that on the collective behavior of neural network. This research will enhance understanding of the role of toxins in neuronal firing and collective behavior of real neural systems.",

We adopt the numerical simulation method with the aim of investigating the synchronous behavior in the neuronal system that is coupled by chemical and electrical synapses under electromagnetic induction. Within the improved model, the effects of electromagnetic induction on neurons are described with additive memristive current on the membrane variable, and the memristive current is dependent on the variation of magnetic flow. The simulation results show that the two coupling modes play an important role in the synchronization of the system. By increasing the chemical synaptic feedback gain, we observe a transition from mixed oscillatory to periodic state at a critical value. In addition, two Hopf bifurcation points are found with the change of the external stimuli, and the state of neuron discharge is influenced by initial values. Furthermore, there is a domain of coupling strength and feedback gain values, in which the two coupled neuron system is synchronized and longer time lag is not conducive to the system synchronization.",

When the magnetic flux is considered as a new variable associated to magnetic field, the improved HR neuron model can describe the effects of electromagnetic induction and radiation on membrane potential, where a memristor is used to bridge the membrane potential and the magnetic flux. In this paper, considering the magnetic flux driven, respectively, by the periodic high and low frequency electromagnetic radiation and the Gaussian white noise, the improved HR neuron model is employed to study the modes transition in electrical activities of neuron. The thought-provoking phenomena are detected and discussed by using bifurcation analysis on sampled time series of membrane potential.

It is found that the electrical activities of single neuron can be changed by exerting excitatory or inhibitory of electrical and chemical autapses. With different feedback gains of electromagnetic induction current, membrane potential shows the oscillatory solutions and steady states. Under the condition of different autapse or electromagnetic induction, the propagation of electrical activities caused by the central neuron is transformed in the forward feedback network. Moreover, the spatial synchronization of the network will be changed by choosing different coupling intensities and feedback gains. It is proved that the electrical and chemical autapses play a significant role in firing modes of single neuron and the wave propagation of the forward feedback networks under the electromagnetic induction.\n",

In this paper, the electrical activities and Hamilton energy of neuron are investigated when external mixed signals (i.e., the periodic stimulus current and the periodic electromagnetic field) are imposed on the neuron under the electromagnetic induction. As a result, the Hamilton energy is much dependent on the mode transition, the multiple electric activity modes and the numerical analysis of Hamilton energy are more complicated under various parameters. When the periodic high-low frequency electromagnetic radiation is imposed in neuron, it is found that the electrical activities are more complex, and the changing of energy is obvious. In addition, the response of electrical activity and Hamilton energy is much dependent on the changing of amplitude A, B when the external high-low frequency signal is imposed on the neuron, meanwhile, the energy of bursting state is lower than the one of spiking state. It can be used for investigation about the energy coding in the neuron even the neuron networks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, based on a chain Hindmarsh\u2013Rose (HR) neural network under the action of electromagnetic field, the effects of connection strength between adjacent neurons on the wave propagation are investigated by utilizing numerical simulations. When the connection strength is increased via the decreasing of distance from central neuron, it is found that the firing rates of neurons in chain HR neural network are increased, and the velocity of wave propagation also becomes fast with the increasing of connection strength maximum. The chemical autapse imposed on the central neuron has a great influence on the firing rates of neurons and the wave propagation with different autaptic intensities. The firing rates of neurons are high, and many neurons can stand the excited state by increasing the field coupling strength. However, when the connection strength is decreased via the decreasing of distance from central neuron, the influences of connection strength maximum on the wave propagation are very small. The synchronization factor of the chain HR neural network is investigated by changing the maximum of connection strength, the autaptic intensity, and the field coupling intensity, respectively. It is found that the larger the field coupling strength is, the better the synchronization of neurons in the chain neural network will be, and the firing rates of neurons are high.",

In this paper, basing on an improved electromagnetic induction model, a chain network is designed to investigate the responses of the neural system to channel noise under field coupling. Both the synchronization factor and coefficient of variation are numerically simulated, and it is found that (i) the weak field coupling strength is conducive to the regularity of discharge patterns in the neuronal network; (ii) the synchronization of neural spikes can be enhanced by selecting a suitable coupling intensity; and (iii) in the presence of the weak noise intensity, the discharge mode of neuron is easily affected by the inducing coefficient. Our results show that the regularity of discharge patterns in a stochastic neural network depends on the field coupling intensity, which reflects the importance of field coupling in the selection of neural discharge modes.",

        "abstract": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway member T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase/PDZ-binding kinase (TOPK/PBK) is closely involved in tumorigenesis and progression. Its overexpression in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) exacerbates tumor malignancy, promotes metastasis, and results in dismal prognosis. Therefore, targeting TOPK is a promising approach for CRC therapy. Here, we report the development of a TOPK selective inhibitor SKLB-C05, with subnanomolar inhibitory potency. In vitro, SKLB-C05 exhibited excellent cytotoxicity and anti-migration and invasion activity on TOPK high-expressing CRC cells and induced cell apoptosis. These activities could attribute to its inhibition of TOPK downstream signaling including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, 2, and 3 (JNK1/2/3), as well as downregulation of FAK/Src- MMP signaling. Furthermore, SKLB-C05 disrupted cell mitosis and blocked CRC cell cycle. In vivo, oral administration of SKLB-C05 at concentrations of 20 and 10 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7day dramatically attenuated CRC tumor xenograft growth and completely suppressed hepatic metastasis of HCT116 cells, respectively. Thus, these findings suggest that SKLB-C05 is a specific TOPK inhibitor with potent anti-CRC oncogenic activity in vitro and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "FLT3 inhibitors have been explored as a viable therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the clinical outcomes of these FLT3 inhibitors were underwhelming except AC220. Therefore, the development of novel FLT3 inhibitors with high potency against both FLT3-WT and FLT3-ITD mutants are strongly demanded at the present time. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of novel N-(5-(tert-butyl)isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-phenylurea derivatives as FLT3 inhibitors. SAR studies focused on the fused rings led to the discovery of a series of compounds with high potency against FLT3-ITD-bearing MV4-11 cells and significantly inhibitory activity toward FLT3. Among these compounds, N-(5-(tert-butyl)isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-(4-(7-methoxyimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)urea (16i), displayed acceptable aqueous solubility, desirable pharmacokinetic profile and high cytotoxicity selectivity against MV4-11 cells. This compound can inhibit phosphorylation of FLT3 and induce apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Further in vivo antitumor studies showed that 16i led to complete tumor regression in the MV4-11 xenograft model at a dose of 60 mg/kg/d while without observable body weight loss. This study had provided us a new chemotype of FLT3 inhibitors as novel therapic candidates for AML.",

Here, phase transition from the ground-state \u03b1-KNH2 (monoclinic P21/m) to \u03b2-KNH2 (monoclinic P21) occurs at 4 GPa; then, with pressure increasing up to 6.8 GPa, \u03b2-KNH2 transforms into \u03b3-KNH2 (monoclinic Pc). By analyzing the partial density of states and charge density, ionic bonding nature between K+ and [NH2]\u2212 is revealed and there exists a strong covalent bonding between N and H atoms in NH2 groups in the three structures. Moreover, N\u2013H\u22efN hydrogen bonding between neighboring NH2 groups is suggested in \u03b2- and \u03b3-KNH2 by investigating the structural details and charge density, which could be favorable for accelerating dehydrogenation behavior of complex metal hydrides.",

The change of the structural, magnetic and electronic structure properties of DyNiO 3  with pressure (up to 10\u202fGPa) have been investigated within generalized gradient approximation plus the Hubbard- U  parameter (GGA\u202f+\u202f U ) method by using density functional theory. We find that pressure reduces the unit cell volume and shrinks Ni O bond lengths while straightening the bond angle. Since the pressure-induced the crystal structure transforms from  P 2 1  to  P 2 1 / n  space group occurs at about 3\u202fGPa. We further show that with increasing pressure, the local magnetic moment of Ni1 remains unchanged (1.703 \u03bc B  ), but that of Ni2 decreases from 0.710 \u03bc B   to zero when the pressure exceeds 6\u202fGPa. The change of the magnetic structure of DyNiO 3  under pressures is attributed to a favorable change in Double-exchange (DE) interaction between Ni and O atoms and the transition of spin states in Ni2. Our results provide a coherent picture of pressure effects in rare-earth nickelates and have implications for the experimental and theoretical work on these compounds.",

We found that the Mg 3 X 2  exhibit a Dirac feature which arises from the  p   z   orbitals of Mg and X atoms under the nonmagnetic (NM) state. The Dirac cone are not affected by stress strains along both the  x  and  y  directions. After considering the magnetic configuration, the ground state of Mg 3 X 2  is antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. This magnetic configuration breaks the Dirac feature and causes a sizeable band gap in Mg 3 X 2  monolayer. The newly predicted Mg 3 X 2  is both mechanically and dynamically stable, implying its experimentally synthetic feasibility. The results are beneficial to this new 2D material in applications and providing a feasible strategy for 2D materials design.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The recent observation of superconductivity at ambient temperature and pressure conditions in an Au-Ag based nanostructure has attracted a great attention. It is critical task to explore the issue whether the pure metals or metal alloys are outstanding candidates for high-temperature superconductors. We have selected the simplest sample, magnesium-lithium (MgLi) compound with stoichiometric composition of 1:1, as the prototype to explore the structural, electronic, and superconducting properties and their evolution behaviors at high pressure conditions. Based on particle-swarm optimization algorithm combined with first-principles calculations, we have identified the transition sequence and established the corresponding phase boundaries. According to electron-phonon coupling calculations, the superconducting critical temperatures for all the predicted thermodynamically stable structures increase with the increasing pressure in their own stable pressure ranges and the resulting highest critical temperature reaches \u223c23\u202fK.",

The calculated results showed that the phase transition from P-1 to C2/m phases occurred at 250 and 120 GPa for HCl and HBr, respectively. Hydrogen bond symmetrization was observed in the newly predicted C2/m phase. No imaginary phonon frequencies in the whole Brillouin zone indicated that the C2/m phases of HCl and HBr were dynamically stable. In addition, the C2/m phase of HBr was the most stable structure, which rejected the earlier hypotheses of elemental decomposition into bromine and hydrogen. Perturbative linear response calculations predicted that the critical temperature Tc of the C2/m phase of HCl could reach 20 K at 250 GPa.",

Here, we have conducted a systematic search for Ca\u2013Li alloys by using a global minima search based on particle-swarm optimization algorithm in combination with density functional theory calculations. We predict that Calcium and Lithium with a high Ca composition CaLi, Ca 2 Li and Ca 3 Li exist, and a strikingly decomposition-combination-decomposition oscillating behavior with pressure is revealed. All predicted Ca\u2013Li compounds are metallic and good electron\u2013phonon superconductors with transition temperatures ( T   c  ) of around 8\u201319\u00a0K. The superconductivity mainly originates from the low-energy Ca vibrations and the pressure dependence of  T   c   is dominated by the phonon softening/hardening.",

Soft transverse acoustic phonon modes are identified in the material, which has been assumed for a long time to have an Al2Cu-type structure with a I4/mcm space group. Using the frozen-phonon method, a tetragonal I4/m structure is uncovered to be energetically more stable and have similar diffraction patterns compared to the previously assumed Al2Cu-type structure. Phonon dispersion and elastic constant calculations reveal the dynamical and mechanical stability of the I4/m structure of Ti2B at ambient pressure. The calculated high elastic constants, modulus, and ideal strength show that Ti2B possesses outstanding mechanical properties.",

The solid solubility of Au in ZnO was found smaller or equal to 1.00 at.% for the ZnO:Au annealed at 350 C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results suggest that Au exists in ZnO:Au with chemical state of AuZnu0027+ while the Au content is 1.00 at.%, once the Au content is larger than 1.00 at.%, Au exists in the ZnO with chemical state of metallic Au in the grain boundary and AuZn1+ in the ZnO:Au. While the incorporation of Au in the ZnO films seem to quench both the band edge and visible emissions of the ZnO films, and the degree of photoluminescence quenching increases with the increasing Au content. PL quenching of the ZnO:Au is attributed to the substitutional doping of Au in the ZnO films, while the degree of quenching may related to the content of metallic Au in the ZnO:Au.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Minimization of the internal strain in growing high quality strained multiple quantum wells (MQWs) has attracted enormous attention due to their high potential with optimized crystal quality for next-generation diode lasers technology applications. Among which the alternative multilayer structures with high performance of the strain quantum wells are prerequisite in the quantum cascade lasers and vertical cavity lasers. The periodic structure with an appropriate design strain-balanced MQWs are imperative for high performance devices. In present work, the strain compensated InGaAs/GaAsP multiple quantum well structures are developed. By engineering the composition of phosphorus in the barrier layer, i.e., 0.15\u202fat.%, the best performance was achieved with high crystal quality via modulating the indium and phosphorus. Our systematic theoretical and experimental studies are performed upon the strain-balanced values investigations by complementary atomic force microscope and photoluminescence characterizations. The influence of variables on the measurement results and the internal correlated impact factors are discussed in detail. With tailored strain compensated structure, our developed InGaAs/GaAsP MQW opens new opportunities for innovative applications with optimized integration in next-generation diode lasers field.",

In the present study, endosulfan, as the newly listed persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Stockholm Convention, was investigated for its feasibility of mechanochemical destruction using high-energy ball milling. Using calcium oxide (CaO) as a co-milling reagent, the degradation efficiency of endosulfan was nearly 100% after ball milling for 60\u00a0min, while the dechlorination efficiency and the sulfate formation efficiency were delayed for endosulfan degradation. After ball milling for 120\u00a0min, the dechlorination efficiency and sulfate formation efficiency reached 87.55% and 26.28%, respectively. Based on the measurement results from various material characterization approaches, the main degradation pathway of endosulfan was proposed as sequential dechlorination followed by the destruction of hydrocarbon skeleton. The GC-MS analysis confirmed that complete desulfurization and dechlorination had been realized finally. This study provides an option for the way toward the efficient and rapid destruction of endosulfan as a new POPs using mechanochemical technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Objectives  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) in early stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) detection in patients in southern China. Additionally, this study proposes a possible ideal cut-off value for each marker to its own population in South China.    Design and methods  Serum HE4 and CA125 were measured in 756 patients with pelvic masses (275 malignancies, 53 borderline tumors and 428 benign diseases), and their ROMA values were calculated. Areas under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) were assessed for HE4, CA125, ROMA and combinations of these biomarkers.    Results  Both HE4 and ROMA performed better diagnostically than CA125 alone for early stage EOC, with AUCs ranging from 0.714 for HE4, 0.699 for ROMA, and 0.463 for CA125 in premenopausal subjects, and 0.902 for ROMA, 0.880 for HE4, and 0.256 for CA125 in postmenopausal subjects.    Conclusions  HE4 and ROMA alone were found to be better than CA125 for detecting borderline tumors and early-stage EOC. The optimal cut-off values (HE4: 70\u00a0pmol/l for all; CA125: 60\u00a0U/ml for pre- and 35\u00a0U/ml for postmenopausal women) could notably improve diagnostic performance in EOC detection in patients in southern China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To study the influence of DCLR (direct coal liquefaction residue) on mechanical properties of flexible pavement, the DCLR/compound DCLR modified asphalt mixture was prepared. The 15\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u00a0\u00b0C compression resilience moduli of DCLR/compound DCLR modified asphalt mixtures were measured using the uniaxial compression test. The influences of DCLR/compound DCLR modified asphalt mixture on deflection, upper layer thickness, and bending flexural tensile stress of layer bottom were analyzed using Bisar3.0 and HPDS software. The test results show the DCLR/compound DCLR modified asphalt has higher compression resilience modulus. Due to higher resilience moduli of DCLR/compound DCLR modified asphalt mixture, they can be used as bottom layer in pavement. Under the identical loadings, the upper layer thickness can be reduced by adding DCLR and compound DCLR. If the upper layer thickness is same, the bending flexural tensile stress of layer bottom and deflection will decrease significantly.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to study the preparation and viscoelastic properties of asphalt binder modified by tetrahydrofuran soluble fraction (THFS) extracted from direct coal liquefaction residue. The modified asphalt binders, which blended with SK-90 (control asphalt binder) and 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% THFS (by weight of SK-90), were fabricated. The preparation process for asphalt binder was optimized in terms of the orthogonal array test strategy and gray correlation analysis results. The properties of asphalt binder were measured by applying Penetration performance grade and Superpave performance grade specifications. In addition, the temperature step and frequency sweep test in Dynamic Shear Rheometer were conducted to predict the rheological behavior, temperature and frequency susceptibility of asphalt binder. The test results suggested the optimal preparation process, such as 150 \u00b0C shearing temperature, 45 min shearing time and 4000 rpm shearing rate. Subsequently, the addition of THFS was beneficial in increasing the high-temperature properties but decreased the low-temperature properties and resistance to fatigue. The content analysis of THFS showed the percentage of 4~6% achieved a balance in the high-and-low temperature properties of asphalt binder. The asphalt binder with higher THFS content exhibited higher resistance to rutting and less sensitivity to frequency and temperature.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of coarse aggregate angularity (CAA) on the performances of warm mix asphalt (WMA) because previous studies have predominantly focused on the effects of CAA on the hot mix asphalt (HMA) performances. Five different CAAs were fabricated using Los Angeles abrasion test, and the digital image processing method was used to identify the CAA. Five mixes with different combinations of CAA and Sasobit-modified asphalt binder were prepared according to the Marshall mix design procedure. The performances such as the resistance to rutting and thermal cracking, moisture susceptibility, and volumetric characteristics of WMA were evaluated. The test results indicated that the CAA value was linearly declined with the abrasive wearing passes increased. Higher CAA value improved the potential to resistance to rutting of WMA but was not suitable to enhance the resistance to thermal cracking of WMA due to sharp corners that caused higher stress concentration. In addition, WMA was more prone to develop numerous macrocracking, which resulted in lower moisture susceptibility due to higher CAA value inducing higher air void, VMA, and VCA of WMA.",

In this study, four DCLR and TLA contents (5, 10, 15, and 20 %) were mixed with the SK-90 base asphalt. The high- and low-temperature performances of the DCLR and TLA modified asphalt were evaluated by the Superpave\\({^{\\rm TM}}\\) and penetration grade systems. The chemical compositions of these materials were analyzed using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. The test results indicate that (1) the DCLR and TLA materials in the asphalt can improve the high-temperature performance of the modified asphalt; (2) the effect of DCLR on improving the performance of asphalt is better than TLA under high temperatures; and (3) it is possible that most of the DCLR and TLA particles are physically dispersed in the asphalt. Therefore, it is better to use the DCLR material for the replacement of TLA considering the cost and performance of DCLR and TLA modified asphalt.",

        "abstract": "The warm mix asphalt was fabricated with different moisture contents (0%, 1%, 2%, and 3%) of limestone aggregates using the Superpave gyratory compactor. The moisture susceptibility of asphalt mixtures with an organic wax additive RH was studied. The samples were compacted and tested using the modified Lottman test AASHTO T283, and the X-ray computed tomography technology was used to capture the internal structure images before and after the freeze-thaw cycles. The test results show that the air voids were distributed in the size range of 0\u20135\u2009mm3 and 5\u201310\u2009mm3. The number of air voids decreased with the increase of air void size and increased after freeze-thaw cycles. The air void content can be influenced by the residual moisture in aggregates. The higher the moisture content of aggregates is, the larger the air void content is. So, the air void content is likely to be sensitive to moisture damage. The increase ratio of the air void and moisture content of aggregates had good correlation with the indirect tensile strength and tensile strength ratio of the samples. The indirect tensile strength and tensile strength ratio of the samples decreased linearly, and the samples were sensitive to the moisture damage with the increases of increase ratio of the air void/moisture content in aggregates.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The functionalization of graphene by nitrogen doping is an excellent method to modify the photocatalytic performance of graphene-based photocatalysts. However, the effect of N-bonding configurations (such as pyrrolic N, pyridinic N and graphitic N) on the photocatalytic performance of nitrogen-doped graphene/TiO 2  composite (N-rGO/TiO 2 ) has seldom been investigated. In this study, the different nitrogen sources (NH 3 , N 2 H 4 , and CO(NH 2 ) 2 ) have been used to prepare the N-rGO/TiO 2  with the aim of obtaining different N-bonding configurations in graphene. It was found that when the NH 3  and CO(NH 2 ) 2  were used as the N-doping precursors, the resultant N-rGO/TiO 2  photocatalysts mainly showed the pyrrolic N (u003e70%) and pyridinic N (u003e10%). As for the N 2 H 4  precursor, the prepared N-rGO/TiO 2 (N 2 H 4 ) primarily exhibited the pyrrolic N (ca. 63%) and graphitic N (ca. 37%) in graphene. The photocatalytic results indicated that all the N-rGO/TiO 2  showed an obviously enhanced photocatalytic performance compared with the undoped rGO/TiO 2 . Moreover, the N-rGO/TiO 2 (N 2 H 4 ) displayed the highest photocatalytic activity ( k\u00a0 =\u00a00.29\u00a0min \u22121 ), which is remarkably larger than that of TiO 2  and rGO/TiO 2  by a factor of 3.63 and 2.64, respectively. On the basis of the above results, a synergistic effect of graphitic N and pyrrolic N in graphene is proposed to account for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of N-rGO/TiO 2 (N 2 H 4 ), namely, the graphitic-N doped graphene serves as an effective electron-transfer mediator for the photogenerated electrons while the pyrrolic-N doped graphene functions as the oxygen-reduction active site to rapidly promote the following interfacial catalytic reaction. It is quite believed that the synthetic effect of electron-transfer mediator and oxygen reduction activation site is a general and effective strategy for the design of high-performance photocatalytic materials.",

        "abstract": "Crystalline TiO2 is a well-known oxide which can be used to improve the photocatalytic performance of other photocatalytic materials by a semiconductor-coupling strategy. However, compared with crystalline TiO2, amorphous TiO2-modified semiconductors have seldom been reported. In this study, amorphous TiO2 (referred to as Ti(IV)) as a hole cocatalyst was used to modify the photocatalytic performance of a Bi2WO6 photocatalyst by a facile wet-chemical method, where metallic Pt as the electron cocatalyst was also coated on the Bi2WO6 surface to promote the interfacial electron transfer. It was found that the dual-cocatalyst modified Ti(IV)\u2013Pt/Bi2WO6 photocatalyst exhibited an obviously higher photocatalytic performance than the blank Bi2WO6 and single-cocatalyst modified Pt/Bi2WO6 and Ti(IV)/Bi2WO6. Based on the present experimental results, we propose a synergistic effect of amorphous Ti(IV) and Pt to illustrate the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Ti(IV)\u2013Pt/Bi2WO6 photocatalyst, namely amorphous Ti(IV) works as a hole cocatalyst to rapidly transfer the photogenerated holes in the valence band of Bi2WO6, while Pt acts as an electron cocatalyst to rapidly transfer the photogenerated electrons on its conduction band. As a consequence, the transfer rate and the interfacial catalytic reaction of photogenerated electrons and holes were simultaneously accelerated, which resulted in improved photocatalytic performance of the Ti(IV)\u2013Pt/Bi2WO6 photocatalyst. The above synergistic effect mechanism in Ti(IV)-modified Bi2WO6 photocatalysts can further be demonstrated by using a low-cost Fe(III) or Cu(II) electron cocatalyst. The present study suggests that amorphous Ti(IV) can act as a new and effective hole cocatalyst for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts, which provides an approach for the design and development of high-performance visible-light photocatalysts with amorphous oxides.",

        "abstract": "For a CdS-based photocatalyst, both the photocorrosion resistance and the rapid H2-production reaction are highly required for improving its photocatalytic H2-production performance. In this study, a facile strategy was reported to simultaneously realize an improved photocorrosion resistance and rapid interfacial H2-evolution reaction of CdxZn1\u2212xS solid\u2013solution photocatalysts in a sulfur-rich S2\u2212/SO32\u2212 solution. Here, the suspensible CdxZn1\u2212xS nanocrystal photocatalysts are prepared by a one-step co-precipitation route through the direct introduction of Zn2+/Cd2+ mixing ions in a sulfur-rich Na2S\u2013Na2SO3 solution, and the resultant CdxZn1\u2212xS nanocrystals (ca. 5 nm) display a suspensible structure owing to the numerous and selective adsorption of S2\u2212/SO32\u2212 on the surface of these CdxZn1\u2212xS nanocrystals. It is found that the bandgap structure of CdxZn1\u2212xS (from 2.25 to 3.52 eV) nanocrystals can be easily controlled by adjusting the Cd2+/Zn2+ molar ratio. The photocatalytic experimental results suggested that the suspensible CdxZn1\u2212xS nanocrystal photocatalysts clearly displayed an excellent photocatalytic H2-production performance, and the suspensible Cd0.6Zn0.4S nanocrystals exhibit the highest photocatalytic H2-generation performance of 717.19 \u03bcmol h\u22121, a value higher than that of the sole CdS (320.99 \u03bcmol h\u22121) and ZnS (5.89 \u03bcmol h\u22121) by a factor of 2.2 and 121.8 times, respectively. Based on the experimental results, a possible S2\u2212 active site-mediated mechanism accounted for the high H2-production activity of the suspensible CdxZn1\u2212xS nanocrystals, namely the numerous adsorbed S2\u2212 ions not only function as efficient hole scavengers to rapidly consume the photogenerated holes, resulting in an improved photocorrosion resistance of suspensible CdxZn1\u2212xS nanocrystals, but also serve as effective H+-capturing active sites to accelerate the interfacial H2-production reaction. Meanwhile, an optimum bandgap structure of suspensible CdxZn1\u2212xS nanocrystals is also extremely required for promoting the photocatalytic H2-production activity. This research may provide advanced insights for developing stable and high-activity photocatalytic materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Exploiting novel non-noble metal cocatalysts and their facile synthetic strategies are quite crucial to develop high-performance H 2 -production photocatalysts. Here, metallic Bi nanoparticle as a new H 2 -evolution cocatalyst was deposited on the TiO 2  surface to significantly enhance its H 2 -evolution activity by a direct photoinduced method in a Bi(III)-EG complex system. Photocatalytic H 2 -production experimental results suggested that all the resultant Bi/TiO 2  photocatalyst display a dramatically higher photocatalytic H 2 -production performance than the pure TiO 2 . Specifically, the Bi/TiO 2 (1\u202fwt%) photocatalysts exhibited the highest H 2 -evolution activity (37.10\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fh \u22121 ), which is higher than the naked TiO 2  photocatalyst (0.35\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fh \u22121 ) by a factor of 106 times. In addition to the TiO 2 , the metallic Bi nanoparticles can also serve as an effective cocatalyst to significantly improve the H 2 -evolution performance of the well-known visible-light responded g-C 3 N 4  and CdS photocatalysts. According to the above result, an electron cocatalyst-mediated mechanism of metallic Bi is proposed for the enhanced H 2 -production activity, where the metallic Bi cocatalyst works as an electron capturer to rapidly accept photogenerated electrons from the TiO 2  surface and subsequently functions as a H 2 -evolution active site to promote H 2  formation. Compared with the widely used noble metals (such as Pt), the present promising Bi cocatalyst is one of the very important cocatalysts for the synthesis of highly efficient photocatalytic materials due to its low cost and abundance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The rapid interfacial charge transfer and interfacial catalytic reaction are highly desirable to improve the photocatalytic H 2 -evolution performance of semiconductor photocatalysts. To achieve the goal, in the paper, MoS x -rGO/TiO 2  was synthesized by a facilely two-step photocatalytic reduction approach including reducing GO/TiO 2  to rGO/TiO 2  and then reducing ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ((NH 4 ) 2 MoS 4 ) to form amorphous MoS x  on the rGO surface. In the case, the rGO nanosheets as an electron mediator caused rapid transportation of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band (CB) of TiO 2 , while amorphous MoS x  served as an effective active site for the following interfacial reduction reaction for H 2  evolution. The photocatalytic results indicated that the H 2 -evolution rate of synthesized MoS x -rGO/TiO 2  was 206.6\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0h \u22121 , which was obviously higher than that of TiO 2  (6.9\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0h \u22121 ), rGO/TiO 2  (31.8\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0h \u22121 ) and MoS x /TiO 2  (150.1\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0h \u22121 ) due to the rapid interfacial charge transfer and interfacial catalytic reaction. Considering the present mild and green approach, the obtained MoS x -rGO/TiO 2  could be regarded as a potential photocatalyst for the practical application.

        "abstract": "For a CdS-based photocatalyst, both the photocorrosion resistance and the rapid H2-production reaction are highly required for improving its photocatalytic H2-production performance. In this study, a facile strategy was reported to simultaneously realize an improved photocorrosion resistance and rapid interfacial H2-evolution reaction of CdxZn1-xS solid-solution photocatalysts in a sulfur-rich S2-/SO32- solution. Here, the suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystal photocatalysts are prepared by a one-step co-precipitation route through the direct introduction of Zn2+/Cd2+ mixing ions in a sulfur-rich Na2S-Na2SO3 solution, and the resultant CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals (ca. 5 nm) display a suspensible structure owing to the numerous and selective adsorption of S2-/SO32- on the surface of these CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals. It is found that the bandgap structure of CdxZn1-xS (from 2.25 to 3.52 eV) nanocrystals can be easily controlled by adjusting the Cd2+/Zn2+ molar ratio. The photocatalytic experimental results suggested that the suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystal photocatalysts clearly displayed an excellent photocatalytic H2-production performance, and the suspensible Cd0.6Zn0.4S nanocrystals exhibit the highest photocatalytic H2-generation performance of 717.19 \u03bcmol h-1, a value higher than that of the sole CdS (320.99 \u03bcmol h-1) and ZnS (5.89 \u03bcmol h-1) by a factor of 2.2 and 121.8 times, respectively. Based on the experimental results, a possible S2- active site-mediated mechanism accounted for the high H2-production activity of the suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals, namely the numerous adsorbed S2- ions not only function as efficient hole scavengers to rapidly consume the photogenerated holes, resulting in an improved photocorrosion resistance of suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals, but also serve as effective H+-capturing active sites to accelerate the interfacial H2-production reaction. Meanwhile, an optimum bandgap structure of suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals is also extremely required for promoting the photocatalytic H2-production activity. This research may provide advanced insights for developing stable and high-activity photocatalytic materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Introduction  Epilepsy influences the ability to drive. We aimed to systematically summarize factors associated with driving, holding a driveru0027s license, and traffic accidents among people with seizures.    Material and methods  Eight databases were searched (from their inception to 27 June 2018). We included all published observational studies, except for case reports and studies with fewer than 50 participants. Pooled mean differences and pooled risk ratios (pRRs) with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random effects.    Results  Data were available from 18 studies, reporting a wide range of factors. There were frequent biases associated with cross-sectional study designs, selection bias, poor statistical quality, small samples, and lack of validation of models. The following six variables were consistently associated with driving: male gender (pRR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.64), being in paid work (pRR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.46 to 2.03), married (pRR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.57), older age at seizure onset or diagnosis (pooled mean difference: 4.83; 95% CI: 0.48 to 9.18\u202fyears), less frequent seizures (fewer than monthly, pRR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.56), and taking one or no antiepileptic drug (pRR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.63). Lower seizure frequency was also protective for avoiding traffic accidents (pRR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.66).    Discussion  Stable multivariate models to predict driving or traffic accidents among people with seizures have not yet been developed. Current evidence shows that the likelihood of driving is associated with demographic and epilepsy-related factors, while the risk of traffic accidents is associated with seizure frequency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Comorbid epilepsy and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) represent a serious challenge for the clinicians. However, the frequency, associations, and outcomes of dual diagnosis of epilepsy and PNES are unclear.  The aim of the review was to determine the frequency, correlates, and outcomes of a dual diagnosis. A systematic review of all published observational studies (from inception to Dec. 2016) was conducted to determine the frequency, correlates, and outcomes of dual diagnosis. We included studies of individuals of any age reporting a dual diagnosis of epilepsy and PNES. All observational study designs were included with the exception of case reports and case series with fewer than 10 participants.  The mean frequency of epilepsy in patients with PNES across all studies was 22% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 20 to 25%, range: 0% to 90%) while the mean frequency of PNES in patients with epilepsy was 12% (95% CI 10 to 14%, range: 1% to 62%). High heterogeneity means that these pooled estimates should be viewed with caution. A number of correlates of dual diagnosis were reported. Some studies delineated differences in semiology of seizures in patients with dual diagnosis vs. PNES or epilepsy only. However, most of the correlates were inconclusive. Only a few studies examined outcome in patients with dual diagnosis.  Dual diagnosis is common in clinical practice, especially among patients referred to specialized services, and requires careful diagnosis and management.",

        "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of intracranial aneurysm in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is higher than that among the general population. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence and natural history of intracranial aneurysm among patients with ADPKD. Methods: Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus, from inception to July 2016, were searched for studies reporting the occurrence of intracranial aneurysms among participants with ADPKD. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of all retrieved studies and extracted data. Information on the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms and their natural history in participants with ADPKD was collected from all included studies. Results: Fifteen studies with 1,490 participants with ADPKD were pooled to study about the prevalence of intracranial aneurysm in participants with ADPKD, and the prevalence rate was found to be 10% (95% CI 7-13%). Studies from China, Japan and Europe (Germany, Poland) reported a higher prevalence of intracranial aneurysm. Having a family history of haemorrhagic stroke or intracranial aneurysm was a risk factor for aneurysm occurrence. Twenty-three percent (95% CI 15-31%) of the participants had multiple aneurysms. Most of the aneurysms were small (Conclusions: Screening for intracranial aneurysm is recommended in patients with ADPKD when there is a family history of haemorrhagic stroke or intracranial aneurysm and when they are from China, Japan or Europe (Germany, Poland). Based on existing data, regular imaging follow-up is not supported. High-quality, prospective studies are needed in the future.",

Yet the lack of a microscopic understanding of the underlying mechanism has prevented ability to optimize and control the performance of such devices. This requires information on interfacial structure and charging behavior at the molecular level. Here, we use sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (SFVS) to study the roles of solvated ions, graphene, surface moiety on substrate and water molecules at the aqueous solution/graphene/polymer interface. We discover that the surface dipole layer of the neutral polymer is responsible for ion attraction toward and adsorption at the graphene surface that leads to electricity generation in graphene. Graphene itself does not attract ions and only acts as a conducting sheet for the induced carrier transport. Replacing the polymer by an organic ferroelectric substrate could allow switching of the electricity generation with long durability. Our microscopic understanding of the electricity generation process paves the way for the rational design of scalable and more efficient droplet-motion-based energy transducer devices.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional superconductors have attracted growing interest because of their scientific novelty, structural tunability, and useful properties. Studies of their magnetic responses, however, are often hampered by difficulties to grow large-size samples of high quality and uniformity. We report here an imaging method that employed NV centers in diamond as sensor capable of mapping out the microwave magnetic field distribution on an ultrathin superconducting film of micron size. Measurements on a 33nm-thick film and a 125nm-thick bulk-like film of BiSrCaCuO revealed that the ac Meissner effect (or repulsion of ac magnetic field) set in at 78K and 91K, respectively; the latter was the superconducting transition temperature (T) of both films. The unusual ac magnetic response of the thin film presumably was due to thermally excited vortex-antivortex diffusive motion in the film. Spatial resolution of our ac magnetometer was limited by optical diffraction and the noise level was at 14 \u03bcT/Hz. The technique could be extended with better detection sensitivity to extract local ac conductivity/susceptibility of ultrathin or monolayer superconducting samples as well as ac magnetic responses of other two-dimensional exotic thin films of limited lateral size.",

Dependence of steady state surface temperature as well as its temporal evolution on laser parameters, such as repetition rate and beam radius, together with medium properties is thoroughly investigated using the analytical solution, which is supported by numerical simulation. It is found that when the pulse number is larger than 100 within the heat diffusion time, the steady-state temperature rise reaches more than 85% of the temperature rise induced by CW laser heating of the same power. We provide a summary of the results to allow their use for a quick estimate of surface temperature evolution from pulse laser heating if laser parameters and medium properties are known.",

        "abstract": "Fouling of polymeric membranes remains a major challenge for long-term operation of oily-water remediation. The common reclamation methods to recycle fouled membranes have the issues of either incomplete degradation of organic pollutants or damage to filter membranes. Here, a calcinable polymer membrane with effective reclamation after fouling is reported, which shows full recovery of the original oil/water separation efficiency. The membrane is made of polysulfonamide/polyacrylonitrile fibers by emulsion electrospinning, followed by hydrothermal decoration of TiO nanoparticles. The bonding structured fibrous membrane displays outstanding thermal stability in air (400 \u00b0C), strong acid/alkali resistance (at the pH range from 1 to 13), and robust tensile strength. As a result, the chemically fouled polymeric membrane can be easily reclaimed without decreasing in separation performance and mechanical properties by annealing treatment. As a proof-of-concept, the as-prepared membrane is integrated into a wastewater separation tank, which achieves a high water flux over 3000 L m h and oil rejection efficiency of 99.6% for various oil-in-water emulsions. The presented strategy on membrane fabrication is believed to be an effective remedy for membrane fouling, and should apply in a wider field of filtration industry.",

Here, we develop an origami as photothermal material based on daily pencil and paper for solar driven water purification in emergency. The drawn process destroyed the Van der Waals\u2019 force between graphite layers, making pencil cartridge exfoliated into thin graphite sheets. The paper fibers combined with graphite sheets were demonstrated with broadband absorption for solar energy harvesting and excellent hydrophilicity for water transportation. The origami structure effectively promoted the utilization of solar energy attributing to the increased solar absorption area and decreased solar reflection loss compared with planar system. In particular, the solar vapor efficiency and vapor evaporation rate of as-prepared origami system were reached to 80% and 1.16\u202fkg\u202fm \u22122 \u202fh \u22121 , respectively. In addition, the analog calculation results of COMSOL Multiphysics indicated that the origami structure was free from the dynamic solar motion. Herein, this nearly free cost, facile fabricated and high efficiency design would unlock a new generation of efficient water purification for water supply in emergency.",

Here, we designed a multifunctional photothermal material based on a copper mesh with abundant CuO nanowires. This CuO nanowire mesh exhibited a high solar absorption of 93% and superhydrophilicity for water transport, contributing to a high solar vapor efficiency of 84.4% under one-sun illumination. Besides, the CuO nanowires possessed a great catalytic ability for the degradation of contaminants in raw water. Moreover, the diffusion inhibition test showed a clear antimicrobial effect of the CuO nanowire mesh on the bacteria. Hence, the as-prepared multifunctional...",

A total of 6,798 subjects, including 2201 patients with TN, were enrolled in this study. Anthropometric, biochemical, thyroid ultrasonographic, and other metabolic parameters were all measured. There was obviously sexual difference in the prevalence of TN (males 26.0%, females 38.5%, resp.). The prevalence of TN in hyperuricemia (45.7% versus 37.4%,  = 0.001), NAFLD (41.2% versus 36.4%,  < 0.05), and MetS (41.4% versus 35.4%,  < 0.001) groups was significantly increased only in females. Insulin resistance [OR = 1.31 (1.15, 1.49)], MetS [OR = 1.18 (1.03, 1.35)], and diabetes [OR = 1.25 (1.06, 1.48)] were all independent risk factors for TN in total subjects, whereas, after stratified analysis of gender, MetS [OR = 1.29, (1.09, 1.53)] and diabetes [OR = 1.47, (1.17, 1.84)] are still strongly and independently associated with the higher risks of TN in female subjects, but not in males. Our results suggest that the components of MetS might associate with the higher risks of TN in women than in men, but further cohort study of this gender disparity in the association between TN and MetS is required.",

We conducted a randomized clinical study of specifically designed isoenergetic diets, together with fecal shotgun metagenomics, to show that a select group of SCFA-producing strains was promoted by dietary fibers and that most other potential producers were either diminished or unchanged in patients with T2DM. When the fiber-promoted SCFA producers were present in greater diversity and abundance, participants had better improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels, partly via increased glucagon-like peptide-1 production. Promotion of these positive responders diminished producers of metabolically detrimental compounds such as indole and hydrogen sulfide. Targeted restoration of these SCFA producers may present a novel ecological approach for managing T2DM.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms facilitating hypertension in diabetes still remain to be elucidated. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a higher risk factor for insulin resistance, shares many predisposing factors with diabetes. However, little work has been performed on the pathogenesis of hypertension in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with NAFLD. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of hypertension in different glycemic statuses and to analyze relationships between NAFLD, metabolic risks, and hypertension within a large community-based population after informed written consent. A total of 9473 subjects aged over 45 years, including 1648 patients with T2DM, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Clinical and biochemical parameters of all participants were determined. The results suggested that the patients with prediabetes or T2DM were with higher risks to have hypertension. T2DM with NAFLD had significantly higher levels of blood pressure, triglyceride, uric acid, and HOMA-IR than those without NAFLD. Data analyses suggested that hypertriglyceridemia [OR\u2009=\u20091.773 (1.396, 2.251)], NAFLD [OR\u2009=\u20092.344 (1.736, 3.165)], hyperuricemia [OR\u2009=\u20091.474 (1.079, 2.012)], and insulin resistance [OR\u2009=\u20091.948 (1.540, 2.465)] were associated with the higher prevalence of hypertension independent of other metabolic risk factors in type 2 diabetes. Further studies are needed to focus on these associations.",

        "abstract": "Experiments indicate that particle clusters that form in fluidized\u2013bed risers can enhance gas-phase velocity fluctuations.\n Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent flow past uniform and clustered configurations of fixed particle assemblies\n at the same solid volume fraction are performed to gain insight into particle clustering effects on gas-phase turbulence,\n and to guide model development. The DNS approach is based on a discrete-time, direct-forcing immersed boundary method (IBM)\n that imposes no-slip and no-penetration boundary conditions on each particle\u2019s surface. Results are reported for mean flow\n Reynolds number Re\n \n p\n \u2009=\u200950 and the ratio of the particle diameter d\n \n p\n  to Kolmogorov scale is 5.5. The DNS confirm experimental observations that the clustered configurations enhance the level\n of fluid-phase turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) more than the uniform configurations, and this increase is found to arise from\n a lower dissipation rate in the clustered particle configuration. The simulations also reveal that the particle-fluid interaction\n results in significantly anisotropic fluid-phase turbulence, the source of which is traced to the anisotropic nature of the\n interphase TKE transfer and dissipation tensors. This study indicates that when particles are larger than the Kolmogorov scale\n (d\n \n p\n \u2009>\u2009\u03b7), modeling the fluid-phase TKE alone may not be adequate to capture the underlying physics in multiphase turbulence because\n the Reynolds stress is anisotropic. It also shows that multiphase turbulence models should consider the effect of particle\n clustering in the dissipation model.",

However, the accuracy of projection images is limited by rotation errors during the acquisition process. Therefore, evaluating the performance of precision rotary stage and developing corresponding compensation method are necessary in Micro-CT system. In this paper, a metered system is designed which is composed of four precision capacitive sensors, a precision machined steel cylinder and four flexible hinges. Based on the metered system, a method to calibrate and correct the errors when the precision stage turns is proposed. Firstly, the theoretical analysis is proposed and the imperfect situations are considered. And then, the method has been applied to correct experimental data taken from a microscope type of Micro-CT system. Successful results are shown through evaluating MTF (Modulation Transfer Function) of Micro-CT system. Lastly, a sample of tungsten wire is scanned and the reconstructed images are compared before and after using the calibrated method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To improve the performance and efficiency of an X-ray source in ordinary X-ray digital radiation imaging system (OXDRIS), parallel-polycapillary optics, in which a divergent X-ray beam can be modulated into a quasi-parallel beam, is introduced in the OXDRIS. The properties of the X-ray beam including beam intensity and divergence are then studied in polycapillary-optics-coupled X-ray DR imaging system (POXDRIS). Furthermore, the characteristics of a digital radiation (DR) image including spatial resolution and contrast are discussed using the POXDRIS. The intensity of the X-ray beam has been increased thirtyfold compared to\u00a0the OXDRIS without the parallel-polycapillary optics. Moreover, a quasi-parallel beam with a divergence of 2.2 mrad is obtained.\u00a0The results of the preliminary numerical analysis show that the image contrast and anti-noise performance are enhanced. As the energy range and spatial resolution are influenced by the material used and principle of the polycapillary, the approach should be employed carefully.",

        "abstract": "In the absence of adequate social security systems, many people in developing countries, especially the poor and vulnerable, cope through migration-related remittances. However, when remittances, internal or international, provide social benefits similar to public transfers they may overlap: \u2018crowding-out\u2019 effects occur. Employing three long-sample Vietnam Household Living Standard surveys undertaken during the 2000s, this paper studies the crowding-out effects of remittances in Vietnam, a developing country that has experienced a soaring inflow of remittances since 2000. Significant crowding-out effects for both domestic and international remittances on income are found below the poverty line in Vietnam, consistent with an altruistic motive. Beyond this, transfer derivatives are positive and statistically significant in both areas, suggesting a switch of motives from altruism to exchange at the poverty line. The substituting relationship between public transfers and remittances observed for the rural poor reveals key challenges to delivering an equal and efficient social security system in the country.",

        "abstract": "This paper assesses the spillover effects of the United States\u2019 unconventional monetary policy (i.e., quantitative easing programs adopted during 2008\u20132014) on the Asian credit market. With a focus on cross-border bank lending, we employed firm-level loan data with regard to the syndicated loan market and measured the international bank lending channel through changes in United States dollar-denominated loans extended to Asian borrowers. We found that the growth of dollar credit in Asia increased substantially in response to quantitative easing in the United States financial market. The results of this study confirm the existence of the bank lending channel in Asia and emphasize the role of credit flows in transmitting financial conditions. The paper also provides new evidence of cross-border liquidity spillover in the syndicated loan market. We found that the overall spillover effect was large but differed significantly in Asia by types of borrowing firms, financing purposes, and loan terms at different stages of the quantitative easing programs. The paper concludes with a discussion of relevant policy implications for the region.",

        "abstract": "Facile chemical synthesis of PtAg nanowires with different compositions through co-reduction of Ag and Pt precursors has been demonstrated. A facet-matching coupled autocatalytic growth mechanism, which favors reducing the exposed surface area while minimizing the interface mismatch energy with the formation of a coherent interface, is supported by SEM, TEM, XRD and EDS characterizations. Interestingly, tunable electrocatalytic activities have also been shown, which can be up to three times higher toward the direct methanol oxidation reaction in acid media for the dealloyed Pt94Ag6 than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst based on the same mass of Pt. Such an excellent catalytic performance can be ascribed to the synergy effect of enhanced electric conductivity, clean surface, significantly increased caves, as well as the hetero-atomic interactions on the surface of alloyed nanoparticles.",

In this paper, we first present a facile approach to the preparation of palladium-based organometallics by using dimethyl sulfoxide as the unconventional organic ligands, which leads to the formation of (AcO)2\u2013Pd\u2013(DMSO)2 microrods with well-defined morphology. A sequential heat treatment combining with galvanic replacement provides access to hierarchically nanostructured mesoporous Pd, Pd@Au and Pd@Pt catalysts, which can be used as excellent electrocatalysts with high activity and stability in methanol oxidation. We anticipate that this coordination-thermal decomposition-galvanic replacement coupled strategy will provide a general route to the manufacture of sophisticated bimetallic catalysts bearing three-dimensionally mesoporous features on the nanometer scale.",

Due to the desired surface charge characteristics and attractive electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of ascorbic acid, such ultralong one-dimensional nanomaterials provided an interesting platform for electrochemical signal amplification. By immobilizing an anti-IgG antibody on the chitosan (CS)-CuSNWs film, a novel label-free electrochemical immunosensor was thus developed for detection of human immunoglobulin G (IgG). Various experimental parameters were studied, and the interference effects from other proteins were checked. Under the optimum conditions, the decrease of the amperometric signal presented a linear relationship in the IgG concentration range of 0.001-320 ng mL with a detection limit of 0.1 pg mL (S/N = 3). The practical application of the fabricated immunosensor has also been demonstrated by detecting IgG in real human serum samples. The satisfactory results hint the significant potential in clinical analysis.",

Because of the low density of the carbon sponge and the filmy nanowires, the device exhibits a total mass of less than 0.1 g for a volume of 12.5 cm3 and it produces a short-circuit current of 6 \u03bcA, open-circuit voltage of 75 V, and a maximum output power of 0.28 W kg\u22121 under light finger tapping.

        "abstract": "The need for cost-effective and sustainable power supplies has spurred a growing interest in hybrid energy harvesting systems, and the most elementary energy production process relies on intermittent solar power. Here, it is shown how the ambient mechanical energy leads to water splitting in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell boosted by a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). In this strategy, a flexible TENG collects and transforms mechanical energy into electric current, which boosts the PEC water splitting via the charged Li-ion battery. Au nanoparticles are deposited on TiO2 nanoarrays for extending the available light spectrum to visible part by surface plasmon resonance effect, which yields a photocurrent density of 1.32 mA cm\u22122 under AM 1.5 G illumination and 0.12 mA cm\u22122 under visible light with a bias of 0.5 V. The TENG-charged battery boosts the water splitting performance through coupling electrolysis and enhanced electron\u2013hole separation efficiency. The hybrid cell exhibits an instantaneous current more than 9 mA with a working electrode area of 0.3 cm2, suggesting a simple but efficient route for simultaneously converting solar radiation and mechanical energy into hydrogen.",

It is therefore important to identify new serum biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of this disease. The present study identifies biomarkers in NPC patient serum using a solid-phase antibody array detecting the expression profiles of 174 cytokines in a single experiment. ELISA was performed to validate the array results. The levels of TIMP-2, SELL, CCL24, MMP-1, MMP-3, IGF-I and IL-8 were significantly higher in serum from NPC patients, while the levels of MSP-alpha and HCC-4 were lower. Furthermore, the validation results were identical to those obtained from the antibody array. These results indicate that these cytokines might serve as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of NPC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present a great risk to the atmospheric environmental as well as the public health and safety. In this study, a series of TiO 2 /zeolites catalysts were synthesized by sol-gel method. They showed much better photocatalytic activity for benzene degradation under UV irradiation compared with commercial TiO 2  (P25), which suffered from typical catalyst deactivation. Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation was used to further enhance photocatalytic oxidation of benzene. The VUV-PCO process obtained much higher benzene removal efficiency (nearly 100%) than conventional UV-PCO (less than 10%). Besides photocatalytic oxidation, photolysis and ozone-assisted catalytic oxidation was also involved in the VUV-PCO process and they contributed much to benzene degradation. Most of the removed benzene was oxidized into CO 2 . Among the prepared photocatalysts, TiO 2 /ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratio of 200 obtained the best catalytic activity due to its appropriate porous structure and framework, which led to superior capacity for benzene absorption and ozone decomposition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The application of photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) in VOCs abatement is greatly limited by catalytic deactivation and inefficiency. In this study, mesoporous TiO 2  was prepared by a one-step hydrolysis method via varying the calcination temperature and used for photocatalytic oxidation of gaseous benzene. Results revealed that the calcination temperature significantly affects the structural properties and catalytic activity of TiO 2 . The fabricated mesoporous TiO 2  exhibited much better catalytic activity and stability towards benzene degradation compared to commercially-available TiO 2  (P25) which suffered from quick deactivation and low efficiency. The samples calcined at 400\u00a0\u00b0C showed a good mesoporous structure and superior capacity for benzene adsorption, which led to the best photocatalytic activity. VUV irradiation in the PCO process greatly enhanced benzene degradation and exhibited a benzene removal efficiency of 80% while it was less than 10% under UV irradiation. VUV photolysis and O 3  generated from VUV irradiation made a major contribution to benzene degradation in the VUV-PCO process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the crucial precursors to the formation of fine particulate matter and photochemical smog. Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) under vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation has attracted increasing interest for VOCs degradation owing to its strong oxidation capability and excellent stability. However, the generation of O 3  from VUV irradiation causes secondary pollution and needs to be addressed. In this study, the Mn doped mesoporous TiO 2  (Mn/meso-TiO 2 ) was developed and first combined with VUV irradiation to remove O 3  as well as enhance benzene degradation via O 3 -assited catalytic oxidation. Results indicate that the Mn doped TiO 2  exhibited a much higher benzene removal efficiency (82%) than undoped one (70%) and commercial TiO 2  P25 (48%). The O 3  by-product can be completely eliminated by Mn/meso-TiO 2  and contributed to benzene removal efficiency of about 34%. The excellent performance was attributed to the formation of highly reactive oxidizing species such as O( 1 D), O( 3 P), hydroxyl radicals ( OH) via catalytic decomposition of O 3  over oxygen vacancy sites of Mn oxides. Mn/meso-TiO 2  cooperated well with VUV and such a VUV-PCO process is very promising for VOCs degradation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Wet gas represents a special gas-liquid two-phase flow case which is often encountered in the oil and gas industry, such as wet natural gas extraction from a condensate field. The on-line, non-separation measurement of wet gas under ultra-low liquid fraction conditions is an important research area that presents significant technical challenges. In this paper, a method based on dimensional analysis is investigated that may enable predictions of the over-reading parameter in wet gas with liquid fractions less than 0.5% using non-separation measurement. A standard orifice plate with a diameter of 50\u00a0mm and a beta ratio of 0.55 was used as the flow measurement device. The dimensional analysis method was used to investigate the flow characteristics of a wet gas flowing through an orifice plate for Lockhart-Martinelli parameters ranging from 0 to 0.08, gas Froude numbers ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 and liquid gas density ratios ranging from 75 to 170. A measurement-based correlation of the wet gas over-reading parameter in an orifice plate is derived using dimensionless parameters combined with physical analysis. The experimental data shows that the relative deviation of this correlation is less than \u00b12% in experimental verification. The results of this study show that this method can be applied to the non-separation measurement of wet natural gas from the ultra-low liquid fraction of an oil and gas field in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the present stage, wet gas measurement is playing an increasingly significant role in the oil and gas industry. Phase fraction is an important parameter for the determination of pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient in wet gas flow. In this paper, experimental investigations of the wet gas phase fraction based on convective heat transfer (CHT) is conducted. In order to describe the \u201cover reading\u201d of CHT coefficient due to the existence of the liquid phase, it is innovative to define \u03c9 as the ratio of the CHT coefficients of wet gas and gas alone. An easy-to-use correlation is proposed by using the gas flow rate and the temperature measured before and after the electrical heating belt. The experiment was carried out in the wet gas flow loop in Tianjin University. System pressure ranges from 0.6\u00a0MPa to 1.2\u00a0MPa, and gas mass fraction (GMF) is from 23.8% to 100%. Final results show that the relative deviation of all data points are less than \u00b115%. There is no doubt that this correlation provides new data on the phase fraction in wet gas annular flow and benefits other researchers in wet gas measurement.",

In this paper, taking the horizontal thermal probe as the study object, natural convection heat transfer from the thermal probe is analyzed and the velocity corresponding to natural convection (VCNC) is solved. According to the method of vector synthesis, the effective velocity corresponding to forced convection is obtained. A new correction formula based on the effective velocity, for the measurement of the gas mass flow, is presented. Experimental investigation is carried out in the medium pressure closed-loop gas flow device in Tianjin University. The gas velocity is varied from 0.1 to 3.5m/s, resulting in VCNC in the ranges of 1.755m/s to 2.372m/s. The reference error of gas mass flow is controlled within 2.49%.",

        "abstract": "Despite decades of studies, the currently available drugs largely fail to control neuropathic pain. Koumine-an alkaloidal constituent derived from the medicinal plant  Benth.-has been shown to possess analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects and the possible underlying mechanisms of koumine. The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of koumine were explored by using chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI) neuropathic pain model  and LPS-induced injury in microglia BV2 cells . Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis were used to assess the modulator effect of koumine on microglia and astrocyte activation after CCI surgery. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to evaluate the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to examine the modulator effect of koumine on microglial M1 polarization. We found that single or repeated treatment of koumine can significantly reduce neuropathic pain after nerve injury. Moreover, koumine showed inhibitory effects on CCI-evoked microglia and astrocyte activation and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production in the spinal cord in rat CCI models. In BV2 cells, koumine significantly inhibited microglia M1 polarization. Furthermore, the analgesic effect of koumine was inhibited by a TSPO antagonist PK11195. These findings suggest that the analgesic effects of koumine on CCI-induced neuropathic pain may result from the inhibition of microglia activation and M1 polarization as well as the activation of astrocytes while sparing the anti-inflammatory responses to neuropathic pain.",

Koumine, one of its representative alkaloids, shows numerous promising pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Here, we investigated the analgesic effect of koumine on the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model of RA and explored the potential pharmacological mechanisms underlying the analgesia. In the CIA rats, repeated koumine treatments significantly reduced pain compared to controls and attenuated the collagen-induced increase in levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). Cultured astrocytes showed reduced astrocyte reactivation and decreased production of both tested cytokines. Based on our results, koumine exerted both analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects on the CIA rat model that were apparently mediated by inhibiting astrocyte reactivation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.",

        "abstract": "Koumine, an indole alkaloid, is a major bioactive component of . Previous studies have demonstrated that koumine has noticeable anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in inflammatory and neuropathic pain (NP) models, but the mechanisms involved are not well understood. This study was designed to explore the analgesic effect of koumine on chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced NP in rats and the underlying mechanisms, including astrocyte autophagy and apoptosis in the spinal cord. Rats with CCI-induced NP were used to evaluate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of koumine. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in rat primary astrocytes was also used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of koumine. We found that repeated treatment with koumine significantly reduced and inhibited CCI-evoked astrocyte activation as well as the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, we found that koumine promoted autophagy in the spinal cord of CCI rats, as reflected by decreases in the LC3-II/I ratio and P62 expression. Double immunofluorescence staining showed a high level of colocalization between LC3 and GFAP-positive glia cells, which could be decreased by koumine. Intrathecal injection of an autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine) reversed the analgesic effect of koumine, as well as the inhibitory effect of koumine on astrocyte activation in the spinal cord. In addition, TUNEL staining suggested that CCI-induced apoptosis was inhibited by koumine, and this inhibition could be abolished by chloroquine. Western blot analysis revealed that koumine significantly increased the level of Bcl-xl while inhibiting Bax expression and decreasing cleaved caspase-3. In addition, we found that koumine could decrease astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation and enhance autophagy in primary cultured astrocytes. These results suggest that the analgesic effects of koumine on CCI-induced NP may involve inhibition of astrocyte activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, which may relate to the promotion of astrocyte autophagy and the inhibition for apoptosis in the spinal cord.",

Koumine could significantly reduce the level of TG, TC, LDL-C, ALT, and AST in the serum of NAFLD rats and increase the level of HDL-C, reduce the liver index, and improve the adipose-like lesions of liver cells in NAFLD rats. Furthermore, treatment with koumine inhibited the severity of NAFLD. In addition, koumine-treated rats significantly increased the proportion of CD4/CD8 T cells and also decreased the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells and increased Th2 and Treg cells in the liver. Moreover, koumine reduced the production and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines . This result showed that koumine could effectively modulate different subtypes of helper T cells and prevent NAFLD. The present study revealed the novel immunomodulatory activity of koumine and highlighted the importance to further investigate the effects of koumine on hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome.",

The structure of PASP/AMP was characterized via 1H NMR and FTIR. Its scale and corrosion inhibition performances were investigated via static and weight loss tests, respectively. Additionally, its biodegradability was assessed by measuring its chemical oxygen demand.

Its corrosion inhibition efficiency for carbon steel is close to 28% at 24 mg L\u22121. The degradation rate of PASP/AMP could reach up to 65% within 28 days. According to the SEM images and XRD spectra, the scale deposits become irregular and distorted in shape, which can easily be dispersed by flowing water.

In particular, PD-2 shows superior corrosion inhibition capacity, and the efficiency is up to 94% at a relatively low concentration of 100 mg L\u22121 at 298 K, as determined by potentiodynamic polarization measurements. Surface analysis of mild steel with PD-2 as an inhibitor clearly indicates that the inhibitor molecules adsorb on the steel surface and efficiently inhibit the corrosion of mild steel. The present work provides very meaningful results in designing and preparing new polymer inhibitors with high inhibition efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the present work, an attempt has been made for the development of green and high efficiency acid pickling inhibitor based on the eco-friendly polyaspartic acid (PASP). In this view, cysteamine modified PASP (PASP-S) containing S atom was prepared by ring-opening reaction of polysuccinimide with cysteamine. The corrosion inhibition performance of PASP and PASP-S for mild steel in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4  medium were evaluated using weight loss, electrochemical impedance and potentiodynamic polarization methods. The inhibition performance of PASP-S is greatly improved with a high efficiency of 93.9% (weight loss method) at a very low concentration of 100 mg L \u22121  at 298 K in comparison with unmodified PASP. The obtained results also indicate that PASP-S is a mixed inhibitor and the adsorption of PASP-S on the mild steel surface follows Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Theoretical chemical parameters are calculated using the Density Functional Theory method (DFT). The excellent inhibition performance of PASP-S is due to the presence of pendent functional sulfhydryl group, which can be confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the mild steel samples. The present work provides a simple and effective pathway for synthesizing high efficiency acid pickling inhibitor by introducing a functional group into the PASP chains. Such chemical modification method may also be an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of other polymer acid pickling inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Melatonin regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt signaling pathways. The MAPK family mainly includes extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Our previous study documented that melatonin delays osteoblast proliferation; however, the mechanism of action of melatonin remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that melatonin significantly inhibited phosphorylation of ERK but not p38, JNK, or Akt in a human osteoblastic cell line 1.19 (hFOB), as measured by western blot. The expression of ERK, p38, JNK, and Akt was not altered. PD98059 (a selective inhibitor of MEK that disrupts downstream activation of ERK) and melatonin alone, and especially in combination, significantly induced an antiproliferative effect, G(1) and G(2) /M phase arrest of the cell cycle, and downregulation of the expression at both the protein and mRNA levels of cyclin D1 and CDK4, related to the G(1) phase, and of cyclin B1 and CDK1, related to the G(2) /M phase, as measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining, and both western blot and real-time PCR, respectively. Moreover, the combination of PD98059 and melatonin synergistically and markedly augmented the action of either agent alone. Coimmunoprecipitation further confirmed that there was an interaction between phosphorylation of ERK and cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin B1, or CDK1, which was weaken in the presence of melatonin or PD98059. These results suggest that the prevention of ERK activation is involved in melatonin-induced G(1) and G(2) /M phase arrest, and this inhibitory effect is potentially via the ERK, but not p38, JNK, or Akt, pathway.",

In this work, we propose an energy efficient algorithm based on the sentinel scheme to reduce the sleeping node detection density by defining a new deep sleeping state for each sensor node. The average energy consumed by probing neighboring nodes is introduced as a factor to calculate the detection rate. In addition, after some theoretical analysis of the existence of coverage holes in WSN, a triangle coverage repair procedure is defined to repair coverage holes. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm obtained better performance in terms of the coverage quality and network life time compared with some existing algorithms in the literature.",

These include minimizing the energy consumption, maximizing the coverage rate and maximizing the equilibrium of energy consumption. Two improved hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Hybrid-MOEA/D-I and Hybrid-MOEA/D-II, have been proposed. Based on the well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), Hybrid-MOEA/D-Ihybrids a genetic algorithm and a differential evolutionary algorithm to effectively optimize sub-problems of the multi-objective optimization problem in WSN. By integrating a discrete particle swarm algorithm, we further enhance solutions generated by Hybrid-MOEA/D-I in a new Hybrid-MOEA/D-II algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed Hybrid-MOEA/D-I and Hybrid-MOEA/D-II algorithms have a signi\ufb01cant better performance compared with existing algorithms in the literature in terms of all the objectives concerned.",

        "abstract": "We report the design of a series of polyesters containing pendant secondary amide groups to probe the cumulative effects of hydrogen bonding and chain flexibility on their thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties. Reported studies on polymers with secondary amide groups have usually focused on the effect of hydrogen bonding interactions on the mechanical, self-assembly, or self-healing properties, whereas the effect of chain flexibility has often been overlooked. In an effort to probe the cumulative effects of hydrogen bonding and chain flexibility, in this work polyesters were designed with either one or two pendant secondary amide-propyl groups and compared to a control polyester with one pendant ester-propyl group. The results show that hydrogen bonding increases glass transition temperature (Tg), Young\u2019s modulus, and polymer brittleness. But at higher temperature (Tg + 50 \u00b0C), rheometry shows that the polyester containing two amide groups has the shortest chain relaxation time and the lowest ze...",

However, current 3D printed biomaterial scaffolds have potential drawbacks due to residual monomers, free-radical initiators, solvents, or printing at elevated temperatures. This work describes a solvent, initiator, and monomer-free degradable polyester platform for room temperature 3D printing. Linoleic acid side chains derived from soybean oil lowers the Tg and prevents packing and entanglement, ensuring that G\u2033 u003e G\u2032 during room temperature printing. Upon printing, cross-linking of pendant functionalized coumarin moieties fixes the viscous filaments to elastomeric solids. Furthermore, the modular design of the polyester platform enables conjugation of ligands, as demonstrated by the conjugation of FITC to surface amines on the 3D printed scaffolds. This low modulus, printable polyester platform addresses several design challenges in 3D printing of functional biomaterials and could potentially be useful in many ti...",

An intracellular \u03b2-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) was partially purified using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatographic methods. A single band was obtained in SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, indicating that the enzyme was highly purified and had an estimated molecular mass of 38.9 kDa. The enzyme exhibited highest activity at pH 4.5\u20135.0. The optimum temperature was 45 \u00b0C. Ethanol promoted the activity of this enzyme up to three times. Among the several metal ions assayed, only Mn2+ exhibited a partial promotion effect. The K m and V max values for p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside were 1.05 mmol/L and 0.957 nmol/min, respectively. Up to now, this study contains the first characterization of a native \u03b2-glucosidase purified from crude extracts of O. oeni 31MBR.",

We aimed to identify essential polyphenols present in various apple varieties, and measure their free phenol and antioxidant capacities using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity, and ferric reducing antioxidant power methods, and correlating with the total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity with high-performance liquid chromatography results. Thirteen apple varieties cultivated in northwest China showed significant polyphenol content. Hongxun 1 had the highest polyphenol content and antioxidant capacities in comparison with other apple varieties, while phlorizin showed the strongest 1,1-diphenyl-2-picylhydrazyl free radical scavenging rate (73.5 \u00b1 2.7%), oxygen radical absorbance capacity value (44.6 \u00b1 3.1 \u03bcmol TE/g), hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity value (61.9 \u00b1 3.5 \u03bcmol TE/g), ...",

In this study, an enzymatic synthesis approach using engineered  P. pastoris  GS115 was developed to produce phloridzin. Four factors, identifying as key factors affecting the phloridzin yield, were optimized by response surface methodology as follows: induction time 121.8\u00a0h, pH 7.0, methanol 0.75%, and a rotation speed 194\u00a0rpm. The maximal yield of phloridzin reached 41.59\u00a0mg/L (95.31\u00a0\u03bcM) and the specific bioconversion rate of substrate was up to 98.50% with 1L working volume in a 5L bioreactor under the optimal conditions. Phloridzin with purity of 93.98% and recovery of 78.14% was achieved just using affinity chromatography and preparative high performance liquid chromatography ( Pre -HPLC). These results confirm the enzymatic synthesis developed provides an efficient alternative to traditional approach for the preparation of phloridzin  in vitro .",

Its association with the Asian\u2013Pacific oscillation (APO) was also investigated. The evaluation results showed that the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) and most of the individual models perform well in reproducing the relatively stronger interannual variability of SST over the North Pacific and tropical eastern Pacific. They can also capture reasonably well the observed in-phase and out-of-phase relationships of the APO with the SST in the above two regions, respectively. Under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the interannual variability of the SST over the North Pacific and the tropical eastern Pacific is projected by the MME to be weakened during 2050\u201399 compared to 1950\u201399.

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Based on the dynamic downscaling by the regional climate model RegCM4 from three CMIP5 global models under the historical and the RCP4.5 simulations, this article evaluated the performance of the RegCM4 downscaling simulations on the air environment carrying capacity (AEC) and weak ventilation days (WVDs) in China, which are applied to measure haze pollution potential. Their changes during the middle and the end of the 21st century were also projected. The evaluations show that the RegCM4 downscaling simulations can generally capture the observed features of the AEC and WVD distributions over the period 1986\u20132005. The projections indicate that the annual AEC tends to decrease and the annual WVDs tend to increase over almost the whole country except central China, concurrent with greater change by the late 21st century than by the middle of the 21st century. It suggests that annual haze pollution potential would be enlarged under the RCP4.5 scenario compared to the present. For seasonal change in the four main economic zones of China, it is projected consistently that there would be a higher probability of haze pollution risk over the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in winter and over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in spring and summer in the context of the warming scenario. Over Northeast China (NEC), future climate change might reduce the AEC or increase the WVDs throughout the whole year, which favours the occurrence of haze pollution and thus the haze pollution risk would be aggravated. The relative contribution of different components related to the AEC change further indicates that changes in the boundary layer depth and the wind speed play leading roles in the AEC change over the BTH and NEC regions. In addition to those two factors, the precipitation change also exerts important impacts on the AEC change over the YRD and PRD zones.",

Results show that relative to the pre-industrial era, the mean temperature over Asia increases by 2.3\u00a0\u00b0C, 3.0\u00a0\u00b0C, 4.6\u00a0\u00b0C, and 6.0\u00a0\u00b0C at warming targets of 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C, 2\u00a0\u00b0C, 3\u00a0\u00b0C, and 4\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, with stronger warming in high latitudes than in low latitudes. The corresponding enhancement in mean precipitation over the entire Asian region is 4.4%, 5.8%, 10.2%, and 13.0%, with significant regional differences. In addition, an increase in warm extremes, a decrease in cold extremes, and a strengthening in the variability of amounts of extreme precipitation are projected. Under the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C target, compared with the climate under the 2\u00a0\u00b0C target, the mean temperature will be lower by 0.5\u20131\u00a0\u00b0C over Asia; the mean precipitation will be less by 5%\u201320% over most of Asia, but will be greater by about 10%\u201315% over West Asia and western South Asia; extreme high temperatures will be uniformly cooler throughout the Asian region, and the warming in extreme low temperatures will decrease significantly in high latitudes of Asia; extreme precipitation will be weaker over most of Asia but will be stronger over West Asia and western South Asia. Under the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C and 2\u00a0\u00b0C warming targets, the probability of very hot weather (anomalies greater than 1\u03c3, \u03c3 is standard deviation), extremely hot weather (anomalies greater than 3\u03c3), and extremely heavy precipitation (anomalies greater than 3\u03c3) occurring will increase by at least once, 10%, and 10%, respectively, compared to the reference period (1861\u20131900).",

        "abstract": "Based on the simulations of 31 global models in CMIP5, the performance of the models in simulating the Hadley and Walker circulations is evaluated. In addition, their change in intensity by the end of the 21st century (2080\u20132099) under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, relative to 1986\u20132005, is analyzed from the perspective of 200 hPa velocity potential. Validation shows good performance of the individual CMIP5 models and the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) in reproducing the meridional (zonal) structure and magnitude of Hadley (Walker) circulation. The MME can also capture the observed strengthening tendency of the winter Hadley circulation and weakening tendency of the Walker circulation. Such secular trends can be simulated by 39% and 74% of the models, respectively. The MME projection indicates that the winter Hadley circulation and the Walker circulation will weaken under both scenarios by the end of the 21st century. The weakening amplitude is larger under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5, due to stronger external forcing. The majority of the CMIP5 models show the same projection as the MME. However, for the summer Hadley circulation, the MME shows little change under RCP4.5 and large intermodel spread is apparent. Around half of the models project an increase, and the other half project a decrease. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, the MME and 65% of the models project a weakening of the summer southern Hadley circulation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Based on the outputs from 21 CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5) models, future changes in the mean temperature, precipitation and four climate extreme indices (annual maximum of daily maximum temperature (TXx), minimum of daily minimum temperature (TNn), annual total precipitation when the daily amount exceeds the 95th percentile of wet-day precipitation (R95p), and maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5day)) over Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region are investigated under the greenhouse gas concentration pathways of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Two periods of the 21st century, 2036\u20132065 and 2066\u20132095, are selected, with the reference period is considered as 1976\u20132005. Results show general increase of the mean temperature, TXx and TNn under both scenarios, with the largest increases found during 2066\u20132095 under RCP8.5. Future precipitation is projected to increase over most part of HKH, except for the northwestern part. Intensification of the precipitation extremes is projected over the region. The uncertainties of mean temperature, TXx and TNn over the HKH1 subregions are the largest compared to the other three subregions and the overall HKH. Besides RX5day during 2036\u20132065 over HKH1, the uncertainties of R95p and RX5day tend to be larger following the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations. The multimodel ensemble medians of temperature and four extreme indices under RCP8.5 are projected to be larger than those under RCP4.5 in each of the subregions.",

The observational results generally show a decrease in the frequency and an increase in the mean intensity of snowfalls in northwestern China (NWC), northeastern China (NEC), the eastern Tibetan plateau (ETP), and southeastern China (SEC) since the 1960s. The total amount of wintertime snowfall, however, has increased in NWC, NEC, and ETP but decreased in SEC. The decrease in snow days is primarily due to the reduction of light snowfall events. The increase in the total amount is primarily explained by increases in heavy snowfalls, and the corresponding decrease is the result of decreases in light-to-heavy snowfalls. The RegCM4 ensemble, which can well simulate the observed snowfall climatology, projects that the snow days will further reduce by the end of the 21...",

The Community Land Model (CLM) is used to describe land surface processes, with updates in the surface parameters, including the land cover and surface emissivity. The simulation is compared against observations to evaluate the model performance in reproducing the present day climatology and interannual variability over the 10 main river basins in China, with focus on surface air temperature and precipitation. Temperature and precipitation from the ERA-Interim reanalysis are also considered in the model assessment. Results show that the model reproduces the present day climatology over China and its main river basins, with better performances in June\u2013July\u2013August compared to December\u2013January\u2013February (DJF). In DJF, we find a warm bias at high latitudes, underestimated precipitation in the south, and overestimated precipitation in the north. The model in general captures the observed interannual variability, with greater skill for temperature. We also find an underestimation of heavy precipitation events in eastern China, and an underestimation of consecutive dry days in northern China and the Tibetan Plateau. Similar biases for both mean climatology and extremes are found in the ERA-Interim reanalysis, indicating the difficulties for climate models in simulating extreme monsoon climate events over East Asia.",

Under global warming of 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C, 2\u00a0\u00b0C, 3\u00a0\u00b0C, and 4\u00a0\u00b0C, significant decrease of HDD can be found over China without considering population factor, with greater decrease over high elevation and high latitude regions, including the Tibetan Plateau, the northern part of Northeast China, and Northwest China; while population-weighted HDD increased in areas where population will increase in the future, such as Beijing, Tianjin, parts of southern Hebei, northern Shandong and Henan provinces. Similarly, the CDD projections with and without considering population factor are largely different. Specifically, without considering population, increase of CDD were observed over most parts of China except the Tibetan Plateau where the CDD remained zero because of the cold climate even under global warming; while considering population factor, the future CDD decreases in South China and increases in North China, the Sichuan Basin, and the southeastern coastal areas, which is directly related to the population changes. The different future changes of HDD and CDD when considering and disregarding the effects of population show that population distribution plays an important role in energy consumption, which should be considered in future research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Climate change has the potential to exacerbate eutrophication and the risk of harmful algal blooms in lakes. Periodic adjustment of nutrient criteria, as the cornerstone of eutrophication control and water quality management, is expected to help mitigate the impact of climate change on harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The nutrient criteria that do not threaten the function of the water body determined with generalized additive models (GAMs) were 0.88\u202fmg/L for total nitrogen (TN) and 0.021\u202fmg/L for total phosphorus (TP) during the period of 1996\u20132005 based on 26 lakes and reservoirs in China. Climate change-induced temperature increases will substantially reduce the required nutrient criteria by 46.17% for TN and 15.24% for TP in lakes and reservoirs by the end of the century under the \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d scenario. The results indicate that some lakes that currently meet the nutrient criteria could become dominated by cyanobacteria and experience blooms in a warmer future, even without increases in nutrient inputs. Therefore, as climate change persists, nutrient loads should be further reduced to achieve the desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication. Strict control of TP would be particularly advantageous to suppress algal blooms. It is imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future climate changes on nutrient criteria and that nutrient criteria are periodically modified. The corresponding nutrient risk thresholds should be determined to ensure that lakes and reservoirs escape the threat of harmful algal blooms under the impact of extreme weather events.",

        "abstract": "Given that climate extremes in China might have serious regional and global consequences, an increasing number of studies are examining temperature extremes in China using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. This paper investigates recent changes in temperature extremes in China using 25 state-of-the-art global climate models participating in CMIP5. Thirteen indices that represent extreme temperature events were chosen and derived by daily maximum and minimum temperatures, including those representing the intensity (absolute indices and threshold indices), duration (duration indices), and frequency (percentile indices) of extreme temperature. The overall performance of each model is summarized by a \u201cportrait\u201d diagram based on relative root-mean-square error, which is the RMSE relative to the median RMSE of all models, revealing the multi-model ensemble simulation to be better than individual model for most indices. Compared with observations, the models are able to capture the main features of the spatial distribution of extreme temperature during 1986\u20132005. Overall, the CMIP5 models are able to depict the observed indices well, and the spatial structure of the ensemble result is better for threshold indices than frequency indices. The spread amongst the CMIP5 models in different subregions for intensity indices is small and the median CMIP5 is close to observations; however, for the duration and frequency indices there can be wide disagreement regarding the change between models and observations in some regions. The model ensemble also performs well in reproducing the observational trend of temperature extremes. All absolute indices increase over China during 1961\u20132005.",

        "abstract": "Based on climate simulations over East Asia from a high-resolution regional climate model under RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, we examine the impact of future climate change and heating policy changes on energy demand in current central heating areas over China using the heating degree days (HDD) and the number of the heating days (NHD) with different base temperature as the indices. Based on current heating policy in China, significant decreases of NHDs are projected, with larger decreases under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5. This decrease of NHDs would cause a northward shift of the decadal heating boundary line, with significant implications for infrastructure planning and development. Changing the heating policy currently in practice to one used in Europe and USA would cause an immediate jump in NHDs and in HDDs; as warming progresses in the future, these effects attenuate with time in an approximately linear trend under the two scenarios. Under RCP8.5, by 2050, the effects of warming climate would dominate over the heating policy change, and heating demand would be lower than the present day HDD and continue to decrease until the end of the century. Energy demand and the number of the heating days during peak winter shows no dependence on heating policy, as the policy-induced increase of energy demand would occur primarily during warmer months of the year. In addition, the indices are further weighted by population, and results show that increases in both HDDs and NHDs can be found in parts of northern China due to the increased population there by the end of the 21st century.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Based on the historical and future outputs of 17 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) models, simulation of the precipitation extremes in China was evaluated under baseline climate condition compared to a gridded daily observation dataset CN05.1. The variations in precipitation extremes for eight global warming targets were also projected. The 17 individual models and the multi-model ensemble accurately reproduced the spatial distribution of precipitation extremes, although they were limited in their ability to capture the temporal characteristics. A notable dry bias existed in Southeast China, while a wet bias was present in North and Northwest China. The precipitation extremes in China were projected to be more frequent and more intense as global temperature rise reached the 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 \u00b0C warming targets. The projected percentage changes in the annual number of days with precipitation u003e50 mm (R50) and total precipitation during days in which the daily precipitation exceeds the 99th percentile (R99p) are projected to increase by 25.81 and 69.14 % relative to the baseline climate for a 1.5 \u00b0C warming target, and by 95.52 and 162.00 % for a 4.0 \u00b0C warming target, respectively. As the global mean temperature rise increased from 1.5 to 5 \u00b0C, the subregions considerably affected by the East Asian summer monsoon (e.g., Southwest China, South China, and the Yangtze-Huai River Valley) were projected to experience a more dramatic increase in extreme precipitation events, in both number of days and intensity, while North and Northwest China were projected to suffer from relatively slight increases. The model uncertainties in the projected precipitation extremes in China by 17 CMIP5 models increase as global temperature rise increases.",

        "abstract": "Much uncertainty exists in reproducing Arctic temperature using different general circulation models (GCMs). Therefore, evaluating the performance of GCMs in reproducing Arctic temperature is critically important. In our study, 32 GCMs in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) during the period 1900\u20132005 are used, and several metrics, i.e., bias, correlation coefficient (R), and root mean square error (RMSE), are applied. The Cowtan data set is adopted as the reference data. The results suggest that the GCMs used can reasonably reproduce the Arctic warming trend during the period 1900\u20132005, as observed in the observational data, whereas a large variation of inter-model differences exists in modeling the Arctic warming magnitude. With respect to the reference data, most GCMs have large cold biases, whereas others have weak warm biases. Additionally, based on statistical thresholds, the models MIROC-ESM, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, HadGEM2-AO, and MIROC-ESM-CHEM (bias\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u00b10.10\u00a0\u00b0C, R\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.50, and RMSE\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.60\u00a0\u00b0C) are identified as well-performing GCMs. The ensemble of the four best-performing GCMs (ES4), with bias, R, and RMSE values of \u22120.03\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.72, and 0.39\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, performs better than the ensemble with all 32 members, with bias, R, and RMSE values of \u22120.04\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.64, and 0.43\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Finally, ES4 is used to produce projections for the next century under the scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.0. The uncertainty in the projected temperature is greater in the higher emissions scenarios. Additionally, the projected temperature in the cold half year has larger variations than that in the warm half year.",

        "abstract": "The existence and magnitude of the recently suggested global warming hiatus, or slowdown, have been strongly debated1\u20133. Although various physical processes4\u20138 have been examined to elucidate this phenomenon, the accuracy and completeness of observational data that comprise global average surface air temperature (SAT) datasets is a concern9,10. In particular, these datasets lack either complete geographic coverage or in situ observations over the Arctic, owing to the sparse observational network in this area                  9                . As a consequence, the contribution of Arctic warming to global SAT changes may have been underestimated, leading to an uncertainty in the hiatus debate. Here, we constructed a new Arctic SAT  using the most recently updated global SATs                  2                 and a drifting buoys based Arctic SAT dataset                  11                 through employing the \u2018data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions\u2019 method                  12                . Our estimate of global SAT rate of increase is around 0.112\u2009\u00b0C per decade, instead of 0.05\u2009\u00b0C per decade from IPCC AR5                  1                , for 1998\u20132012. Analysis of this  shows that the amplified Arctic warming over the past decade has significantly contributed to a continual global warming trend, rather than a hiatus or slowdown.",

Here we report that mice with Per1m/m; Per2m/m double mutations display a decrease in female fertility starting approximately at 20-week-old, with significantly less pups born from 32-week-old onwards. Histological analysis revealed that a significant reduction of ovarian follicles was observed in the Per1/Per2 mutants compared with the littermate controls examined at 26- and 52-week-old while the difference was not statistically significant between the two groups at 3- and 8-week-old. We further showed that vascular development including the ovarian follicle associated vascular growth appeared normal in the Per1/Per2 mutant mice, although clock genes were reported to regulate angiogenesis in zebrafish. The findings imply that loss-of-function mutations with Per1/Per2 result in a premature depletion of ovarian follicle reserve leading to the decline of reproductive capacity.",

        "abstract": "Mechanisms underlying the vein development remain largely unknown. Tie2 signaling mediates endothelial cell (EC) survival and vascular maturation and its activating mutations are linked to venous malformations. Here we show that vein formation are disrupted in mouse skin and mesentery when Tie2 signals are diminished by targeted deletion of Tek either ubiquitously or specifically in embryonic ECs. Postnatal Tie2 attenuation resulted in the degeneration of newly formed veins followed by the formation of haemangioma-like vascular tufts in retina and venous tortuosity. Mechanistically, Tie2 insufficiency compromised venous EC identity, as indicated by a significant decrease of COUP-TFII protein level, a key regulator in venogenesis. Consistently, angiopoietin-1 stimulation increased COUP-TFII in cultured ECs, while Tie2 knockdown or blockade of Tie2 downstream PI3K/Akt pathway reduced COUP-TFII which could be reverted by the proteasome inhibition. Together, our results imply that Tie2 is essential for venous specification and maintenance via Akt mediated stabilization of COUP-TFII.",

        "abstract": "Dysregulation of the circadian rhythm is associated with many diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and cancer. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Arntl or Bmal1) is the only clock gene whose loss disrupts circadian locomotor behavior in constant darkness. BMAL1 levels are affected by proteasomal inhibition and by several enzymes in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, using immunoprecipitation and MS analyses, we discovered an interaction between BMAL1 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 O (UBE2O), an E3-independent, E2-ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (i.e. hybrid E2/E3 enzyme). Biochemical experiments with cell lines and animal tissues validated this specific interaction and uncovered that UBE2O expression reduces BMAL1 levels by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, UBE2O expression and UBE2O knockdown diminished and increased, respectively, BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activity, but did not affect BMAL1 gene expression. Bioluminescence experiments disclosed that UBE2O knockdown elevates the amplitude of the circadian clock in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Furthermore, mapping of the BMAL1-interacting domain in UBE2O and analyses of BMAL1 stability and ubiquitination revealed that the conserved region 2 (CR2) in UBE2O significantly enhances BMAL1 ubiquitination and decreases BMAL1 protein levels. A Cys-to-Ser substitution in the CR2 domain identified the critical Cys residue responsible for BMAL1 ubiquitination mediated by the CR2 domain in UBE2O. This work identifies UBE2O as a critical regulator in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which modulates BMAL1 transcriptional activity and circadian function by promoting BMAL1 ubiquitination and degradation under normal physiological conditions.",

        "abstract": "Living organisms on the earth maintain a roughly 24 h circadian rhythm, which is regulated by circadian clock genes as well as their protein products. Post-translational modifications of core clock proteins could affect the circadian behavior. Although ubiquitination of core clock proteins was studied extensively, the reverse process, deubiquitination, has only begun to unfold and the role of this regulation on circadian function is not completely understood. Here, we use affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis to identify probable ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase FAF-X (USP9X) as an interacting protein of the core clock protein aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (ARNTL or BMAL1). Through biochemical experiments, we discover that USP9X reduces BMAL1 ubiquitination, enhances its stability, and increases its protein level, leading to the elevated transcriptional activity. Bioluminescence measurement reveals that USP9X knockdown decreases the amplitude of the cellular circadian rhythm while the period and phase are not affected. Our experiments find a new regulator for circadian clock at the post-translational level and demonstrate a different regulatory function for the circadian clock through the deubiquitination and the upregulation of the core clock protein BMAL1 in the positive limb of the transcription-translation feedback loop.",

Eighty-five requiring 3 (Efr3) is a plasma membrane protein conserved from yeast to human, and knockout of  was reported to facilitate the survival of hippocampal newborn neurons in adult mice. Previously, we found  expression in the auditory neural pathway is upregulated soon after the destruction of hair cells. Here we conducted a time-course analysis of drug-caused damage to hearing ability, hair cells and SGNs in  knocking down mice (,  KD) and their wild type littermates. Functional examination showed that both groups of mice suffered from serious hearing loss with a higher level of severity in wild type (WT) mice. Morphologic observation following drugs administration showed that both WT and  KD mice went through progressive loss of hair cells and SGNs, in association with degenerative changes in the perikarya, intracellular organelles, cell body conformation in SGNs, and the changes of SGNs in WT mice were more severe than in  KD mice. These beneficial effects of  KD could be ascribed to an increase in the expression of some neurotrophic factors and their receptors in  KD mice. Our results indicate that  insufficiency suppresses drug-caused SNHL neurodegeneration in association with an increase in the expression of some neurotrophic factors and their receptors, which may be targeted in the treatment of neurodegeneration.",

However, although it is highly expressed in the brain, the functional significance of Efr3 in the brain is not clear. In the present study, we generated Efr3af/f mice and then crossed them with Nestin-Cre mice to delete Efr3a, one of the Efr3 isoforms, specifically in the brain. We found that brain-specific ablation of Efr3a promoted adult hippocampal neurogenesis by increasing survival and maturation of newborn neurons without affecting their dendritic tree morphology. Moreover, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) signaling pathway was significantly enhanced in the hippocampus of Efr3a-deficient mice, as reflected by increased expression of BDNF, TrkB, and the downstream molecules, including phospho-MAPK and phospho-Akt. Furthermore, the number of TUNEL+ cells was decreased in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus in Efr3a-d...",

        "abstract": "Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is caused by an irreversible impairment of cochlear hair cells and subsequent progressive degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Eighty-five requiring 3 (Efr3) is a plasma membrane protein conserved from yeast to human, and knockout of Efr3a was reported to facilitate the survival of hippocampal newborn neurons in adult mice. Previously, we found Efr3a expression in the auditory neural pathway is upregulated soon after the destruction of hair cells. Here we conducted a time-course analysis of drug-caused damage to hearing ability, hair cells and SGNs in Efr3a knocking down mice (Efr3a-/+, Efr3a KD) and their wild type littermates. Functional examination showed that both groups of mice suffered from serious hearing loss with a higher level of severity in WT mice. Morphologic observation following drugs administration showed that both WT and Efr3a KD mice went through progressive loss of hair cells and SGNs, in association with degenerative changes in the perikarya, intracellular organells, cell body conformation in SGNs, and the changes of SGNs in WT mice were more severe than in Efr3a KD mice. These beneficial effects of Efr3a KD could be ascribed to an increase in the expression of some neurotrophic factors and their receptors in Efr3a KD mice. Our results indicate that Efr3a insufficiency suppresses drug-caused SNHL neurodegeneration in association with an increase in the expression of some neurotrophic factors and their receptors, which may be targeted in the treatment of neurodegeneration.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism underlying the physiological divergence of species is a long-standing issue in evolutionary biology. The circadian clock is a highly conserved system existing in almost all organisms that regulates a wide range of physiological and behavioral events to adapt to the day-night cycle. Here, the interactions between hCK1\u03f5/\u03b4/DBT (Drosophila ortholog of CK1\u03b4/\u03f5) and serine-rich (SR) motifs from hPER2 (ortholog of Drosophila per) were reconstructed in a Drosophila circadian system. The results indicated that in Drosophila, the SR mutant form hPER2 does not recapitulate the mouse or human mutant phenotype. However, introducing hCK1\u03b4 (but not DBT) shortened the circadian period and restored the SR motif function. We found that hCK1\u03b4 is catalytically more efficient than DBT in phosphorylating the SR motif, which demonstrates that the evolution of CK1\u03b4 activity is required for SR motif modulation. Moreover, an abundance of phosphorylatable SR motifs and the striking emergence of putative SR motifs in vertebrate proteins were observed, which provides further evidence that the correlated evolution between kinase activity and its substrates set the stage for functional diversity in vertebrates. It is possible that such correlated evolution may serve as a biomarker associated with the adaptive benefits of diverse organisms. These results also provide a concrete example of how functional synthesis can be achieved through introducing evolutionary partners in vivo.",

        "abstract": "In the core mammalian circadian negative feedback loop, the BMAL1-CLOCK complex activates the transcription of the genes Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry). To close the negative feedback loop, the PER-CRY complex interacts with the BMAL1-CLOCK complex to repress its activity. These two processes are separated temporally to ensure clock function. Here, we show that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a critical component of the circadian negative feedback loop by regulating both the activation and repression processes in a deacetylase activity-independent manner. Genetic depletion of Hdac3 results in low-amplitude circadian rhythms and dampened E-box-driven transcription. In subjective morning, HDAC3 is required for the efficient transcriptional activation process by regulating BMAL1 stability. In subjective night, however, HDAC3 blocks FBXL3-mediated CRY1 degradation and strongly promotes BMAL1 and CRY1 association. Therefore, these two opposing but temporally separated roles of HDAC3 in the negative feedback loop provide a mechanism for robust circadian gene expression.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nowadays, the stability and on-demand release of drug carriers are still to be solved. To meet the demand of these issues, we developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive selenium-containing polyphosphoesters nanogel (PSeP) by a facile one-step ring-opening polymerization of the novel monomer 4-selenoctane-1,8-diyl bis(propylphosphatelane) (Se-COP) with polyethylene glycol (mPEG) employed as the macroinitiator. Their structure was confirmed by NMR, FT-IR and GPC. The crosslinked core-shell structure imparted the nanogels with excellent dimensional stability according to the dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moreover, the selenide groups endowed the nanogels with rich ROS responsiveness when subjected to the stimuli of H 2 O 2 , thus the drug-loaded PSeP nanogels displayed swollen behaviors leading to an activated doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX\u2009\u00b7\u2009HCl) release. The release mechanisms fitted by the Ritger-Peppas power-law model also proved the swollen release process. MTT assays exhibited that the PSeP nanogels were nontoxic up to a tested concentration of 50\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL \u22121 \u00a0by A549 and HEK293, and the DOX-loaded PSeP had a high anti-cancer behaviour against A549 cancer cells. Additionally, these nanogels possessed enhanced intracellular drug release by CLSM. Therefore, these results highlighted that the selenium-containing polyphosphoesters nanogels could be a potential platform for the ROS-sensitive drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "Well-defined diselenide-centered biodegradable tri-block copolymers methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)-b-methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG-PCL-Se) were precisely synthesized by the combination of ring opening polymerization using di(1-hydroxyethylene) diselenide as a new initiator and a facile coupling reaction. The amphiphilic block copolymers enabled the formation of self-assembled micelles which revealed an excellent reductive response to glutathione (GSH) due to the unique reduction-responsive cleavage of the diselenide bond. Such GSH response ensured an enhanced release of anticancer drugs (DOX) from the micelles in simulative tumor microenvironments; moreover, the drug release could be changed to some extent through fine-tuning the chemical composition of the copolymers. Flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) measurements confirmed that the DOX-loaded micelles could be efficiently taken up by oral squamous carcinoma (HN30) cells and DOX was released into the nuclei of cancer cells following 4 h of incubation. The cell viability assays showed the diselenide-containing polymers were nontoxic up to a tested concentration (400 \u03bcg mL), while the DOX-loaded micelles exhibited an evident inhibition toward HN30 cells. Therefore, the reduction-labile biodegradable (mPEG-PCL-Se) may offer an alternative platform for tumor-targeting therapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Herein, novel multi-responsive injectable polyester hydrogels were reported based on the diselenide-containing poly(e-caprolactone) copolymers ((mPEG-PCL-Se) 2 ). The (mPEG-PCL-Se) 2  solution remained a free-flowing state at ambient temperature but spontaneously turned into a semisolid hydrogel upon heating to physiologic temperature. The phase transition temperature was examined to be dependent on the composition and aqueous concentration of the copolymers. More importantly, the thermo-responsive hydrogels were endowed with oxidation and reduction-triggered degradation by the incorporation of diselenide groups. Accordingly, the degradation of poly(e-caprolactone)-based hydrogels was greatly improved and the rate of degradation was well regulated by the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) or glutathione (GSH). This superior stimuli-responsive degradation could lead to an enhanced drug release of encapsulated drug (Doxorubicin, DOX). Thus the oxidation and reduction-triggered degradable diselenide-containing poly(e-caprolactone) hydrogels would offer great potential for the controlled drug delivery.",

Efflux resistance genes were widely distributed and generally expressed in . Although no clear relation was established between efflux pump gene expression and antibiotic resistance or reduced biocide susceptibility, triclosan non-susceptible isolates displayed relatively increased expression of  and  whereas chlorhexidine non-susceptible isolates had increased  and  gene expression. Increased expression of  and  was also demonstrated in multiple antibiotic resistant isolates.

Unlike numerous investigations on the drug-resistant epidemiology of , virulence molecular epidemiology is less studied. Here, we collected 88  clinical isolates, tested their antimicrobial susceptibility to 10 commonly used antibiotics and analyzed the distribution of 9 selected virulence-associated genes, aims to investigate the primary characteristics of the virulence-associated genes that exist in clinically multidrug resistant (MDR) and non-MDR isolates of . The MIC results showed the resistance rates of ciprofloxacin (68.2%, 60/88), gentamicin (67.0%, 59/88), amikacin (58.0%, 51/88), tobramycin (58.0%, 51/88), doxycycline (67.0%, 59/88), meropenem (54.5%, 48/88) and imipenem (65.9%, 58/88) were all above 50%, except for levofloxacin (34.1%, 30/88), minocycline (1.1%, 1/88) and polymyxin B (0%, 0/88). The Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that the resistance rate of MDR  isolates in the Epidemic group was predominant (79.5%, 44/58), but in the Sporadic group was only 6.7% (2/30). Further investigation on the distribution of virulence genes showed the virulence genes  (95.5%),  (92.0%),  (92.0%),  (88.6%),  (87.5%),  (62.5%) (59.1%) and  (53.4%) were accounted for high proportion, except for  (0%). Overall, our results revealed that MDR isolates predominated in the Epidemic  isolates, and contained a very high proportion of virulence genes, which may lead to high risk, high pathogenicity and high treatment challenge.",

        "abstract": "Active efflux is regarded as a common mechanism for antibiotic and biocide resistance. However, the role of many drug efflux pumps in biocide resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii remains unknown. Using biocide-resistant A. baumannii clinical isolates, we investigated the incidence of 11 known/putative antimicrobial resistance efflux pump genes (adeB, adeG, adeJ, adeT1, adeT2, amvA, abeD, abeM, qacE, qacE\u03941 and aceI) and triclosan target gene fabI through PCR and DNA sequencing. Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR was conducted to assess the correlation between the efflux pump gene expression and the reduced susceptibility to triclosan or chlorhexidine. The A. baumannii isolates displayed high levels of reduced susceptibility to triclosan, chlorhexidine, benzalkonium, hydrogen peroxide, and ethanol. Most tested isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Efflux resistance genes were widely distributed and generally expressed in A. baumannii. Although no clear relation was established between efflux pump gene expression and antibiotic resistance or reduced biocide susceptibility, triclosan non-susceptible isolates displayed relatively increased expression of adeB and adeJ whereas chlorhexidine non-susceptible isolates had increased abeM and fabI gene expression. Increased expression of adeJ and abeM was also demonstrated in multiple antibiotic resistant isolates. Exposure of isolates to subinhibitory concentrations of triclosan or chlorhexidine induced gene expression of adeB, adeG, adeJ and fabI, and adeB, respectively. A point mutation in FabI, Gly95Ser, was observed in only one triclosan-resistant isolate. Multiple sequence types with the major clone complex, CC92, were identified in high level triclosan-resistant isolates. Overall, this study showed the high prevalence of antibiotic and biocide resistance as well as the complexity of intertwined resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates of A. baumannii, which highlights the importance of antimicrobial stewardship and resistance surveillance in clinics.",

The multidrug resistance and virulence potential of  A. baumannii  are responsible for hospital-acquired nosocomial infections. Unlike numerous investigations on the drug-resistant epidemiology of  A. baumanni , virulence molecular epidemiology is less studied. Here, we collected 88  A. baumannii  clinical isolates, tested their antimicrobial susceptibility to 10 commonly used antibiotics and analyzed the distribution of 9 selected virulence-associated genes, aims to investigate the primary characteristics of the virulence-associated genes that exist in clinically multidrug resistant (MDR) and non-MDR isolates of  A. baumannii . The MIC results showed the resistance rates of ciprofloxacin (68.2%, 60/88), gentamicin (67.0%, 59/88), amikacin (58.0%, 51/88), tobramycin (58.0%, 51/88), doxycycline (67.0%, 59/88), meropenem (54.5%, 48/88) and imipenem (65.9%, 58/88) were all above 50%, except for levofloxacin (34.1%, 30/88), minocycline (1.1%, 1/88) and polymyxin B (0%, 0/88). The Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that the resistance rate of MDR  A. baumannii  isolates in the Epidemic group was predominant (79.5%, 44/58), but in the Sporadic group was only 6.7% (2/30). Further investigation on the distribution of virulence genes showed the virulence genes  bap  (95.5%),  surA1  (92.0%),  BasD  (92.0%),  paaE  (88.6%),  pld  (87.5%),  BauA  (62.5%) , omp33-36  (59.1%) and  pglC  (53.4%) were accounted for high proportion, except for  traT  (0%). Overall, our results revealed that MDR isolates predominated in the Epidemic  A. baumannii  isolates, and contained a very high proportion of virulence genes, which may lead to high risk, high pathogenicity and high treatment challenge.",

        "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) presents a serious therapeutic and infection control challenge. In this study, we investigated the epidemiological and molecular differences of CRAB and the threatening factors for contributing to increased CRAB infections at a hospital in western China. A total of 110 clinical isolates of A. baumannii, collected in a recent 2-year period, were tested for carbapenem antibiotic susceptibility, followed by a molecular analysis of carbapenemase genes. Genetic relatedness of the isolates was characterized by multilocus sequence typing. Sixty-seven of the 110 isolates (60.9%) were resistant to carbapenems, 80.60% (54/67) of which carried the bla OXA-23 gene. Most of these CRAB isolates (77.62%) were classified as clone complex 92 (CC92), and sequence type (ST) 92 was the most prevalent STs, followed by ST195, ST136, ST843, and ST75. One CRAB isolate of ST195 harbored plasmid pAB52 from a Chinese patient without travel history. This plasmid contains toxin-antitoxin elements related to adaptation for growth, which might have emerged as a common vehicle indirectly mediating the spread of OXA-23 in CRAB. Thus, CC92 A. baumannii carrying OXA-23 is a major drug-resistant strain spreading in China. Our findings indicate that rational application of antibiotics is indispensable for minimizing widespread of drug resistance. ",

The melting characteristics of crude oil particles are analyzed, and the influence of flow velocity, particle radius, and hot water temperature on the melting process is discussed. The results indicate that the melting rate on the surface of the crude oil is different, the oil particles do not melt concentrically, and the monitoring points and rate of increase in temperature are not substantially affected by the phase change interval. The flow rate and particle radius are found to have a significant influence on the phase distribution of the oil droplets, but changes in water temperature have little effect. After validating a model of the melting process, we investigate the influence of oil particle size, water temperature, flow rate, and oil temperature. It is found that increases in water temperature and flow rate, or a decrease in oil particle size, tend to reduce the melting time.",

In this paper, the temperature drop and pressure drop models of oil-gas-water three-phase flow were deduced theoretically, and for four wells in a block in Tahe oilfield, taking 30\u202f\u00b0C as safe gathering and transportation temperature limit, operation parameters in three kinds of gathering and transportation modes, namely, single well gathering and transportation, branch connection gathering and transportation, and ring gathering and transportation, were determined. The energy consumption and operation cost were calculated, and the comparative analysis results showed that, for these four wells, the most energy saving gathering mode was the branch connection form of pipe network.",

        "abstract": "Groundwater overdraft has consequences in the long-run for the economic and ecological sustainability of an agricultural landscape. In response to aquifer depletion, we examine the tradeoff of non-market ecosystem service benefits (e.g., groundwater supply, greenhouse gases, and surface water quality) and market returns from crops in the Lower Mississippi River Delta. Farmers may turn to conjunctive water management using on-farm reservoirs and tail water recovery when groundwater pumping becomes expensive. We use separate objectives for market returns from crops and the non-market benefits of ecosystem services to study whether on-farm reservoirs are built with optimal cropping and irrigation choices. The use of reservoirs enables the landscape to attain up to 10% higher market returns for a given level of all non-market ecosystem service benefits by lowering the costs of irrigation, increasing groundwater levels, and reducing fuel combustion and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from groundwater pumping. A landscape that internalizes both non-market ecosystem service benefits and market value from crops has 30% greater social value than a landscape where only market returns or only non-market value is optimized.",

        "abstract": "Efficiency frontiers are a useful tool for governmental agencies that balance the protection of ecosystem services with the economic returns from an agricultural landscape because the tool illustrates that a compromise of objectives generates greater value to society than optimizing a sole objective. Policy makers facing the problem of groundwater overdraft on an agricultural landscape want to know if regulations or irrigation technology adoption will enhance both economic and ecosystem service benefits. Conjunctive water management with on-farm reservoirs and tail water recovery system is frequently suggested to alleviate groundwater and surface water quality problems in the Lower Mississippi River Basin of the United States, and this study evaluates the consequence of the adoption of this technology for the balance of ecosystem service and economic objectives. A compromise of objectives that maximizes the value to society provides 76% more value to society without reservoirs and 66% more value to society with reservoirs than the sole objective of economic returns. The reservoirs help an agricultural landscape maximizing economic returns to align more closely with a landscape maximizing the value to society, although there are still significant gains possible from finding a landscape that directly compromises on the objectives.",

        "abstract": "SummaryIn this paper, we study the issue of improving the performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo method to solve local PageRank problem under General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit environment. As a large number of dangling vertices cause large storage space of dangling vertices and thus slow down the Markov chain procession, we propose a reordering strategy to compress the storage space and reduce the computational complexity of Markov chain procession. In our performance study, by parallelizing and optimizing the proposed algorithm based on GPU, the reordering strategy can be up 12\u00d7 faster compared with basic method, where the graphs have high-proportion dangling vertices. According to our investigation on this issue, the variance of random walks determines the number of random walks in the computation; we thus introduce low-discrepancy sequences to enhance the performance. Moreover, the low-discrepancy sequences are organized to load in the on-chip shared memory to accelerate fetching with a wise warp scheduling for bank conflict schema. A series of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the optimization efficiency. Compared with fetching data from off-chip global memory, the shared-memory-based strategy can have over 10\u00d7 speedup ratio performance. The experiments indicate that the size of shared memory has a significant impact on the parallelism of the proposed method as well.",

Based on the bandwidth-limited OAM orthogonal vortex basis set, we study the crosstalk probability of the OAM mode carried by the Bessel Gaussian beam in marine-atmosphere turbulence. We find that the crosstalk probability of the bandwidth-limited OAM mode is larger than that of the spiral plane mode. The crosstalk probability of the bandwidth-limited OAM mode decreases with the increment of the inner scale of turbulence, but this crosstalk probability increases with the increment of the outer scale of turbulence. A Bessel Gaussian beam with optimum initial radius of beam, and long beam wavelength in the transmission window is preferable for application. The energy of the OAM mode primarily spreads to adjacent state. Our research confirms that the beamwidth factor of OAM mode should be added to the study of free-space optical communication to make the calculation results closer to the realistic situations.",

The analytic expression of the received probability of the signal and crosstalk OAM mode is derived based on the theories of extended Rytov and non-Kolmogorov turbulence. Our results show that turbulence with smaller non-Kolmogorov index, smaller inner-scale factor is more easily to induce OAM crosstalk between modes.

Our results indicate that there are optimal radius of the wave-front curvature and transmitting radius of laser beam and optimal focal length of a coupling lens for specific turbulence strength and propagation distance. By utilizing the optimal wave-front curvature, optimal focal length and optimal transmitting beam radius, one can maximize the coupling efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Radix Paeoniae Alba (RPA) is widely used in clinical treatment for gynecological diseases, particularly abnormal menstruation, menstrual pain, and breast tenderness; however, no scientific evidence base links RPA to estrogen replacement therapy. In this study, we characterize estrogenic activity of RPA using immature and ovariectomized (OVX) mice together with in vitro studies focus on estrogen receptor (ER) pathway for molecular mechanism. RPA treatments demonstrated significant estrogenic activity, as indicated by promoting the development of uterus and vagina in immature mice, reversing the atrophy of uterus and vagina in OVX mice, up-regulating the expressions of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 at protein and mRNA level in reproductive tissues. Meanwhile, RPA significantly increased serum estradiol and clearly decreased serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone of immature/OVX mice. Moreover, RPA could induce ER positive MCF-7 cell from S-phase to G2 stage and induce proliferation and no influence on ER negative MDA-MB-231 cell. RPA could bind with ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 and significantly stimulate ER\u03b1/\u03b2-estrogen response element (ERE) luciferase reporter gene expression. All activities were inhibited by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780. This study illustrates RPA exerts estrogenic effects by stimulating biosynthesis of estrogen in circulation, up-regulating ERs in target tissues, and mimicking the estrogen through ER-ERE-dependent pathway.",

Previous studies focused on the chemical constituents induced the toxicological response of the two agents, but this study offers preliminary insight into the pharmacodynamics and mechanism on estrogenic activity which is responsible for their incompatibility. We undertook a characterization of the interaction on estrogenic activity of RPA and VN using in vivo models of immature and ovariectomized (OVX) mice and in vitro studies focused on estrogen receptor (ER) pathway for further mechanism. VN disturbed the estrogenic efficacy of RPA on promoting development of uterus and vagina in immature mice, and reversing the atrophy of reproductive tissues in OVX mice by decreasing the increase of serum estrogen level and upregulation estrogen receptor (ER) expression in reproductive tissues by treatment with RPA. Besides, VN antagonized the estrogenic efficacy of RPA on stimulating the binding with ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, increasing ER\u03b1/\u03b2-estrogen response element (ERE) luciferase reporter gene expression and promoting MCF-7 cells viability. These findings provide evidence that VN inhibits RPA exerting estrogenic effects might be related to regulation of estrogen secretion and ERs, and through ER-ERE pathway.",

QYFE treatments promoted vaginal cornification and prolonged the estrus status of the immature mice, promoted the growth and development of uterus and vagina, upregulated ER and ER expression at protein level in uterus and vagina, increased the level of estradiol (E), and decreased concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in serum.

        "abstract": "The reproductive tissues are negatively influenced by estrogens in hormone therapy. Qingyan formula ethanol extract (QYFE)'s estrogenic effects and safety on reproductive tissues after long-term administration and its mechanism via estrogen receptor (ER) pathway haven't been studied. Here, we characterized its estrogenic effects using ovariectomized rats together with  studies for further molecular characterization. Ovariectomized rats were treated with QYFE at doses of 0.7, 1.4, and 2.8g/kg for 12 weeks. The results showed QYFE has a potent estrogenic activity, as indicated by restoring the disappeared estrous cycle, antagonizing the atrophy of uterus, vagina and mammary gland, and the estrogen decline in circulation caused by ovariectomy. In addition, QYFE upregulated ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 expressions and had a less stimulatory effect on PCNA and ki-67 antigen in reproductive tissues compared with estradiol valerate. QYFE components can bind to ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, significantly increased ER\u03b1/\u03b2-ERE luciferase reporter gene expression, upregulated the expressions of ERs, PR and pS2 in MCF-7 cells at protein and gene level. All these activities were significantly inhibited by the ER antagonist ICI182,780. QYFE's estrogenic activity maybe mediated by stimulating biosynthesis of estrogen and increasing the quantity of ERs in target tissue and via active ER to ERE-independent gene regulation.",

        "abstract": "A new method based on ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(UPLC-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of 22 endocannabinoids(eCBs) and relevant compounds in ovariectomized rat plasma. After being extracted by solid-phase column(SPE), the plasma samples were detected by using UPLC-MS/MS. Analysis was carried out with ACQUITY UPLC BEH C\u2081\u2088 column. The mobile phase was 0.1% acetic acid solution(A)-acetonitrile and isopropanol(9\u22361, B) for the gradient elution. In the positive ion multiple reaction monitoring(MRM) mode, deuterated reagents were taken as standard alternatives to calculate recoveries and simultaneously quantify 22 endocannabinoids. The established method provided a good linearity for the 22 eCBs, and their linearly dependent coefficients were all higher than 0.99. The limits of quantitation(LOQs) ranged from 0.089 6 to 1.965 2 nmol\u2022L-1. Relative recoveries of 5 deuterated surrogates ranged between 11.40% and 129.9%. The repeatability study results showed that RSD was all less than 8.0%. The established method could be used to analyze PGF2a EA, AEA and other endogenous cannabinoids in plasma samples of ovariectomized rats. In summary, this method was proved to boast a high sensitivity, repeatability and practicability, and thus could be used in rat plasma lipid metabolomics study.",

        "abstract": "Objective Hormone replacement therapy has been used as an effective treatment for the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women. In our previous study, QiBaoMeiRan formula (QBMR) had estrogenic activity and could relieve symptoms of hot flushes and body weight increase induced by estrogen decline. However, no evidence base links QBMR to preventing bone loss. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of QBMR on bone loss. Methods The ovariectomized rat model was established, and ovariectomized rats were treated with QBMR at doses of 0.875, 1.75, and 3.5\u2009g/kg per day for 8 weeks. Biochemical parameters, bone mineral density, structural morphometric traits and histological characteristics of trabecular bone were assessed. Results QBMR treatment significantly decreased the increase in serum alkaline phosphatase, bone Gla-protein and C-telopeptide fragments of type I collagen and decreased the decline of serum calcium and phosphorus in the circulation of ovariectomized rats. QBMR completely corrected the decrease in bone mineral density in lumbar vertebrae (L4-L6) comparable to the sham group. In addition, QBMR treatment also significantly ameliorated the decrease of structural parameters of femur trabecular bone, bone volume fraction, trabecular number, trabecular thickness and bone mineral density as well as the increase in trabecular separation by micro-computerized tomography scanning. These were also confirmed by bone histological results that showed its protective action. Conclusions Our results indicated that QBMR had a definite anti-bone loss effect and will have potential to be used for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

Computational cost is decreased through using one-dimensional (1D), rather than two-dimensional equations for pressure head and discharge and using a staggered grid with half of the computational nodes compared to a rectangular grid. It is valid to use the proposed 1D characteristic equations for the pressure head and discharge, as it is proved that these yield identical results to explicit quasi-2D solution procedures previously introduced in the literature.",

However, as compared with the 1-D model, the quasi-2D model bears a higher computational burden. In order to improve the computational efficiency, the 1-D method is proposed to be used to solve directly the pressure head and the discharge in the quasi-2D model in this paper, based on the fact that the pressure head obtained as the solution of the two-dimensional characteristic equation is identical to that solved by the 1-D characteristic equations. The proposed scheme solves directly the 1-D characteristic equations for the pressure head and the discharge using the MOC and solves the 2-D characteristic equation for the axial velocities in order to calculate the wall shear stress. If the radial velocity is needed, it can be evaluated easily by an explicit equation derived from the explicit 2-D characteristic equation. In the numerical test, the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed scheme are compared with two existing quasi-two-dimensional models using the MOC. It is shown that the proposed scheme has the same accuracy as the two quasi-2D models, but requires less computational time. Therefore, it is efficient to use the proposed scheme to simulate the 2-D water hammer flows.",

The results show that the zero-equation model could capture the flow features of the flow field as well as  k -\u025b model. The location of the large vortex compared with PIV experiment data is almost same by zero-equation model and standard  k -\u025b model. The  k -\u025b model could predict the values of velocity a little bit better than zero-equation model.

First, the prediction capability of the numerical calculation method is verified through laboratory experiments. Then, the index of turbulence intensity and mixing effect is presented. Finally, optimization of design and operational parameters is carried out based on the maximization of two indices while minimizing power consumption in an actual water treatment plant. The results have shown that the nature of the flow field has a strong influence on the mixing effect. Moreover, the index of turbulence intensity and mixing effect was shown to provide a feasible approach to the optimization of design and operational parameters. For the mechanical accelerated clarifier in the actual water treatment plant, the optimal paddle diameter, submerged depth, and rotational speed were 0.8\u2009m, 1.25\u2009m, and 40\u2009r/min, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Co-administration of sofosbuvir, an anti-hepatitis C virus medication, and antiarrhythmic amiodarone causes symptomatic severe bradycardia in patients and animal models. However, in a few in vitro studies, the combination of sofosbuvir and amiodarone resulted in tachycardiac effects in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). This discrepancy may be attributable to the use of immature hiPSC-CMs in the in vitro studies. To address this, we evaluated the ability of our in-house hiPSC-CMs to assess the interactions between sofosbuvir and amiodarone in vitro. We performed whole-cell patch recordings on hiPSC-CMs to examine the cardiac effect of sofosbuvir and amiodarone, alone or in combination. We found that sofosbuvir and amiodarone caused bradycardiac effects (the beating rate decreased to 75% of the vehicle control, P < 0.001) on our hiPSC-CMs when applied in combination, but they had no significant effect when applied alone. Furthermore, the bradycardiac effect was membrane potential dependent: it increased with depolarization. This raised the possibility that the bradycardiac effects in vivo may originate in nodal cells, which have a more depolarized resting membrane potential compared with ventricular cells. The bradycardiac effects of sofosbuvir plus amiodarone in vitro are consistent with the clinical phenotype and suggest that our hiPSC-CMs may serve as a useful tool in assessing cardiac safety during drug discovery and development process.",

        "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a hereditary blinding disease characterized by neurodegeneration of photoreceptors. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in animal models of RP exhibit an abnormally high spontaneous activity that interferes with signal processing. Blocking AMPA/Kainate receptors by bath application of CNQX decreases the spontaneous firing, suggesting that inhibiting these receptors in vivo may help maintain the function of inner retinal neurons in rd10 mice experiencing photoreceptor degeneration. To test this, rd10 mice were i.p. injected with CNQX or GYKI 52466 (an AMPA receptor antagonist) for 1-2 weeks, and examined for their retinal morphology (by immunocytochemistry), function (by MEA recordings) and visual behaviors (using a black/white box). Our data show that iGluRs were up-regulated in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of rd10 retinas. Application of CNQX at low doses both in vitro and in vivo, attenuated the abnormal spontaneous spiking in RGCs, and increased the light-evoked response of ON RGCs, whereas GYKI 52466 had little effect. CNQX application also improved the behavioral performance. Interestingly, in vivo administration of CNQX delayed photoreceptor degeneration, evidenced by the increased cell number and restored structure. CNQX also improved the structure of bipolar cells. Together, we demonstrated that during photoreceptor degeneration, blockade of the non-NMDA iGluRs decelerates the progression of RGCs dysfunction, possibly by dual mechanisms including slowing photoreceptor degeneration and modulating signal processing within the IPL. Accordingly, this strategy may effectively extend the time window for treating RP.",

        "abstract": "Adding a free radical-scavenging nitrone moiety on tetramethylpyrazine, we have previously synthesized a chemical named 2-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)oxidoimino]-methyl]-3,5,6-trimethylpyrazine (tetramethylpyrazine nitrone, or TBN) and proved its neuroprotective effect but with limited understanding of its mechanism. Here we ask if TBN protects retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) against excitotoxicity induced by NMDA and explore the underlying mechanism. NMDA was intravitreally injected to induce RGC injury in rats, followed by daily intraperitoneal administrations of TBN. Measurements of TBN concentration at different times after intraperitoneal administration showed that more than 200\u00a0\u03bcM TBN reached the aqueous humor quickly. Then RGCs' survival was evaluated by quantifying Brn3-positive cells, and retinal functions were examined by electroretinogram and visual behaviors. TBN significantly increased the survival of RGCs after NMDA insult, recovered the amplitude of photopic negative responses to flash, and restored the visual behavior. Furthermore, TBN inhibited the apoptotic process, as indicated by the elevated ratios of cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 and of Bax/Bcl-2, and decreased the level of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, TBN reduced RGC's calcium overload induced by NMDA or by KCl. Whole-cell patch recording from RGCs further showed that TBN slightly but significantly inhibited L-type calcium channels, but had little effect on T-type calcium channel or NMDA-, \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid(AMPA)-induced current. Thus our data indicate that TBN alleviates NMDA-elicited injury of rat RGCs both morphologically and functionally, possibly by inhibiting the L-type calcium channel thus reducing Ca overload and by directly scavenging free radicals. Therefore, TBN may be a novel candidate for treating excitotoxicity-related visual disorders such as glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "Methyl 3,4 dihydroxybenzoate (MDHB) is a small molecule that shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in a photoreceptor-degenerative mouse model. Here we investigated whether MDHB protects retina in a mouse model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) and explores the underlying mechanisms. AOH was induced in mice by increasing intraocular pressure to approximately 90\u202fmmHg for 60\u202fmin, then MDHB or vehicle was intraperitoneally injected daily up to 7 days. Immunostaining and multi-electrode array recordings were performed to examine the structure and function of retinas receiving the treatments. Western-blotting was applied to test the expression of several proteins related to oxidative stress and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-initiated signaling. Results showed that AOH injury reduced the number of Brn3a-stained retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and ChAT-amacrine cells; thinned the inner retinal layers and induced apoptosis. Physiologically, AOH decreased the response of OFF and ON-OFF RGCs. All of these changes were reversed by MDHB-treatment. Mechanistically, MDHB appeared to work on three parallel pathways: (1) MDHB decreased the production of reactive oxygen species, the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and cytosol heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1); (2) It upregulated the expression of BDNF and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), and activated the downstream AKT pathways; (3) It inhibited reactive gliosis by reducing GFAP and Iba-1 expression. Thus our results suggest that MDHB protects retina against AOH injury by inhibiting oxidative stress, activating the BDNF/AKT signaling and inhibiting inflammatory pathways. Therefore, MDHB may serve as a promising candidate to treat retinal ischemia.",

        "abstract": "We used the whole-cell current clamp technique to examine the response of our in-house hiPSC-CMs to the 28 CiPA-selected compounds, aiming to compare field potential via MEA from core-sites and action potential via current clamp measurement. Our blinded study showed that all seven high-risk test compounds, including bepridil, caused early afterdepolarizations (EADs) at mid-high and/or high concentration(s). All hERG channel blockers in the mid-risk category prolonged APD30 and APD90 at mid-high, and then led to EADs at their respective high concentrations; while chlorpromazine, clarithromycin and risperidone showed little effects. In addition, ranolazine was the only low-risk test compound to prolong APD30 and APD90 at mid-high, and then produce EADs at high concentration. In conclusion, our results generally agreed with data from all core-sites of the CiPA consortium using the MEA method. Moreover, our assay can successfully detect pro-arrhythmic risk of drug candidates such as bepridil with superior sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa is a photoreceptor-degenerative disease that is currently untreatable and eventually causes blindness. Methyl 3,4 dihydroxybenzoate (MDHB) is a small molecule that exerts neuroprotective effects in\u00a0vitro. The present study tests whether MDHB protects the retina of rd10 mice, a model of retinitis pigmentosa. MDHB or an equal volume of vehicle was intraperitoneally injected in rd10 mice daily from postnatal day 12 (P12) to P26. Retinal morphology was evaluated by immunostaining, and retinal function by electroretinogram (ERG) and by visual behavior. TUNEL, Iba1, GFAP staining and western blotting were applied to explore the neuroprotective mechanism of MDHB in retina. MDHB treatment significantly promoted photoreceptor survival and preserved cone morphology compared to the untreated animals. The visual behavior and ERG responses were also greatly enhanced in MDHB-treated rd10 mice. Mechanistically, following MDHB treatment, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was decreased in rd10 retina, and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein and phosphorylated tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor were increased. Furthermore, blocking TrkB using the antagonist ANA-12 prevented the protective effect of MDHB on photoreceptor survival and structure. MDHB treatment also inhibited microglial activation and Muller cell gliosis in rd10 retina. In conclusion, MDHB treatment delays retinal degeneration in rd10 mice and preserves retinal structure and functions. These effects are likely mediated by the BDNF-TrkB pathway. Due to its neurotrophic effects and ability to reduce reactive gliosis, MDHB may be useful to treat degenerative diseases in retina and brain.",

        "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are a group of autoimmune astrocytopathies in the central nervous system, which are mainly caused by immunoglobulin G (IgG) against astrocyte water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). In this study, we aimed to establish a model of NMOSD-related optic neuritis (NMOSD-ON) and to evaluate the progressive changes of the optic nerve and visual function. AQP4 IgG-positive serum from NMOSD patients was injected into the subarachnoid space of the rat optic nerve to induce the NMOSD-ON model (AQP4\u00a0+\u00a0group), and healthy serum was injected as the control. The visual evoked potential, pupillary light reflex and optical coherence tomography were monitored every week for 3 weeks after induction. Compared with the control group, the amplitude of the N1-P1 peak and pupillary light reflex in the AQP4+ group were reduced within the first week and then remained low thereafter. Consistent with the functional deficits, the thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer in the AQP4\u00a0+\u00a0group was also greatly reduced. At the end of 3 weeks, there was a loss of retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerves showed characteristic NMOSD-like pathologic changes, including deposition of AQP4 IgG, local astrocyte damage, demyelination, microglia activation, macrophage infiltration and axonal injury. Thus, we have established an NMOSD-ON rat model with deficits in the optic nerve and visual function that may be a valuable tool for exploring the mechanism of NMOSD-ON and evaluating its potential therapeutic treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Although effects of water regimes on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the growing season of rice have been well stated, it is not well documented how water regimes practiced in rice season influence GHGs and their global warming potential (GWP) over the whole annual cycle of paddy-upland crop rotation in Central China. Three water regimes during the growing season of a drought resistant rice cultivar ( Oryza sativa  L. subsp.  indica ), including continuous flooding (CF), flooded and wet intermittent irrigation (FWI), and rain-fed with limited irrigation for fertilizer application and in the case of serious drought (RFL), were initiated in 2012 in Hubei province, China. Emissions of GHGs were monitored from sowing of rapeseed ( Brassica napus  L.) to rice harvest in 2014, and the GWP and yield-scaled GWP were estimated from an annual rapeseed\u2013rice rotation. Compared with CF, over the two rice seasons, FWI and RFL treatments significantly reduced methane (CH 4 ) emissions, while apparently increased nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. FWI and RFL treatments practiced in rice season did not trigger significant CO 2  emissions in the following rapeseed season. However, N 2 O emissions in the rapeseed season were significantly reduced by FWI and RFL treatments, thus there were no significantly difference in annual N 2 O emissions among three treatments. Although the rapeseed season showed a weak source of CH 4  emission, the plots preceded by water-saving treatments continuously presented a reduction tendency in CH 4  emissions in rapeseed season. Totally, in comparison to CF treatment, the averaged annual GWP over the whole rotation cycle were significantly decreased by 21% and 24% under FWI and the RFL treatments, respectively. Water-saving irrigation treatments obtained lower annual yield-scaled GWP than CF treatment. Compared with CF treatment, FWI treatment did not exhibit a yield loss in rice or rapeseed across both years. In conclusion, from a sustainable agricultural perspective, using water-saving irrigation like FWI treatment could be an effective and safe option for simultaneously realizing the three goals of saving water, mitigating GHGs and maintaining sustainable rapeseed\u2013rice production.",

In the Si/C@CNF composite, PVP-carbon as the conductive network is introduced in the core of fibers. Such carbon network connects each Si nanoparticle and greatly improves the high rate stability of Si/C@CNF nonwoven anode. The optimal Si/C@CNF anode delivers a reversible capacity as high as 1506.5\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg -1  at 0.1\u202fA\u202fg -1  and outstanding rate performance of 555.0\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg -1  at a high current density of 2\u202fA\u202fg -1 . After 500 electrochemical cycles at a current rate of 0.2\u202fA\u202fg -1 , the reversible capacity retention is up to 86%. The Coulombic efficiencies are close to 100%. The superior properties of Si/C@CNF flexible nonwoven anode make this material attractive for further flexible and high energy density LIBs applications.",

        "abstract": "Neurons transmit information around the body in the form of electrical signals, but these signals cannot cross the gaps between neurons. To send a message to its neighbor, a neuron releases a molecule known as a neurotransmitter into the gap between the cells. The neurotransmitter binds to proteins on the recipient neuron and triggers new electrical signals inside that cell. When the message has been received, the neurotransmitter molecules are returned to the first neuron so that they can be reused. This recycling is particularly important in the visual system, where neurons communicate via rapid-fire signaling. In fruit flies, for example, light-sensitive neurons in the eye known as photoreceptors release a neurotransmitter called histamine when they detect light. Supporting cells called laminar glia take up any leftover histamine and combine it with another molecule known as \u03b2-alanine to form a larger molecule. The photoreceptors absorb this larger molecule and break it back down into histamine and \u03b2-alanine. However, it is not clear how the \u03b2-alanine returns to the glia to allow this cycle to continue. Many molecules rely on so-called \u201ctransporter\u201d proteins to help them move into or out of cells. To identify transporters that might help to move \u03b2-alanine, Han, Xiong et al. prepared a list of fruit fly genes that encode transporter proteins found inside the insect\u2019s head. Testing the resulting proteins in a cultured cell system revealed that one of them was able to transport \u03b2-alanine. This protein, named BalaT, is found in another type of support cell called retinal pigment cells. Mutant flies that cannot produce BalaT are blind because their photoreceptors have problems in transmitting information to other neurons. Han, Xiong et al. propose that BalaT transports \u03b2-alanine from photoreceptors to retinal pigment cells, which then pass \u03b2-alanine on to the laminar glia. Follow-up studies are required to find out exactly how the laminar glia take up histamine.",

        "abstract": "Classical fast neurotransmitters are loaded into synaptic vesicles and concentrated by the action of a specific vesicular transporter before being released from the presynaptic neuron. In Drosophila, histamine is distributed mainly in photoreceptors, where it serves as the main neurotransmitter for visual input. In a targeted RNAi screen for neurotransmitter transporters involved in concentrating photoreceptor synaptic histamine, we identified an SLC45 transporter protein, LOVIT (loss of visual transmission). LOVIT is prominently expressed in photoreceptor synaptic vesicles and is required for Drosophila visual neurotransmission. Null mutations of lovit severely reduced the concentration of histamine in photoreceptor terminals. These results demonstrate a LOVIT-dependent mechanism, maintaining the synaptic concentration of histamine, and provide evidence for a histamine vesicular transporter besides the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) family.",

        "abstract": "In the mammalian auditory pathway, the cochlea is the first stage of processing where the incoming sound signal is mapped into various frequency channels. This multi-channel output contains subtle spectrotemporal features essential in sound source identification and segregation. These features have a large dynamic range. They have a large gain and sharp tuning at low sound levels, and a low gain and broad tuning at high sound levels. These properties are inherent in the Cascade of Asymmetric Resonators with Fast-Acting Compression (CAR-FAC) model of the cochlea. The CAR segment of the model simulates the basilar membraneu0027s response to sound while the FAC segment simulates hair cells and sub-cortical responses resulting in a neural activity pattern necessary for sound perception analysis. We have previously implemented the CAR model on an FPGA, and in this paper, we implement the complete CAR-FAC model with 100 sections on an FPGA for a sample rate of 32 kHz. The FAC part includes outer and inner hair cell algorithms incorporating nonlinearity as well as an automatic gain control for modulating basilar membrane output with respect to input sound levels. We have implemented our design using time-multiplexing approach, where hardware resources of one cochlea section are reused for all the 100 sections of the model.",

        "abstract": "Filters in cochlea models use different coefficients to break sound into a two-dimensional time-frequency representation. On digital hardware with a single sampling rate, the number of bits required to represent these coefficients require substantial computational resources such as memory storage. In this paper, we present a cochlea model operating at multiple sampling rates. As a result, fewer bits are required to represent filter coefficients on hardware as opposed to all the filters operating at a single sampling rate. Additionally, with a 108-filter cochlea implementation, up to nine times fewer coefficients are used than a single sampling rate approach across all filter sections. We present an implementation of 108 filters in Matlab and on an Altera Cyclone V FPGA with a low logic level utilization of 2.57%. Our model can thus be extended to include other auditory processing models such as loudness, pitch perception and timbre recognition on a single FPGA.",

The CAR part simulates the basilar membrane's (BM) response to sound. The FAC part models the outer hair cell (OHC), the inner hair cell (IHC), and the medial olivocochlear efferent system functions. The FAC feeds back to the CAR by moving the poles and zeros of the CAR resonators automatically. We have implemented a 70-section, 44.1 kHz sampling rate CAR-FAC system on an Altera Cyclone V Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with 18% ALM utilization by using time-multiplexing and pipeline parallelizing techniques and present measurement results here. The fully digital reconfigurable CAR-FAC system is stable, scalable, easy to use, and provides an excellent input stage to more complex machine hearing tasks such as sound localization, sound segregation, speech recognition, and so on.",

The Mikhailov plot is generated with ease using the edge theorem and mapping theorem, and by inspection of the plot, the uncertaintyu0027s impact becomes transparent. The performance of the proposed method is tested on a 547-machine 8647-bus model of the actual North China system.

The effectiveness of such a stabilizer depends on a number of factors, among them how stabilizer parameters are tuned playing a key role. In this case study, two common parameter tuning methods, the ideal phase curve method and the residue method, are used to determine the parameters of a PSS4B stabilizer and a PSS1A stabilizer. Simulation results of a 162-bus system and a 2383-bus system are reported. It is concluded that PSS4B can provide more flexible phase compensation if properly tuned and at least two lead-lag blocks in each branch of PSS4B are suggested to be used.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A green and efficient method for the selective aerobic oxidation of  p -cresol to  p -hydroxybenzaldehyde catalyzed by co-catalysts between metalloporphyrins and metal salts was investigated and developed. The relationship between the synergistic catalytic effects and the composition as well as amount of co-catalysts was investigated. Moreover, the influence of different reaction conditions was studied in details. A high  p -cresol conversion (u003e\u00a099%) and  p -hydroxybenzaldehyde selectivity (83%) were obtained using only 1.125\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u2212\u00a05 \u00a0mol T( p -CH 3 O)PPFe III Cl-Co(OAc) 2  used under mild, optimized reaction conditions. A possible mechanism for the reaction was also proposed. This work would be meaningful and instructive for the further researches and applications of co-catalyst system on oxidation of cresols and could give some enlightenment on the selectively catalytic oxidation of the side-chain alkyls of aromatics.",

The fluorescence visualization paper-based sensor is established through combining double quantum dots (QDs) with high-activity nanoporphyrins (QDs-nanoporphyrin), realizing double nanometer signal amplification and producing different color change responses to these three OPPs. In particular, this approach is based on Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) for fingerprint spectrum analysis of three kinds of organophosphorus pesticides in complex matrix (apple and cabbage). Therefore, different concentrations of pesticide residues can be quickly identified at the same time with 100% accuracy for both training set and prediction set. In summary, this method has high selectivity and stability, and thus provides a new approach for the identification of organophosphorus residues in complex systems.",

        "abstract": "Carbon quantum dots (CQDs), especially originated from biomass, have emerged as a rising star for the construction of metal ion sensor because they can serve as sensitive, selective and biocompatible probes. The present work describes a novel kind of ascorbic acid (AA)-enhanced CQDs which are synthesized with a kind of famous green teas, Maojian, serving as carbon source. Compared with the CQDs only based on Maojian teas, citric acid (CA)-enhanced and ascorbic acid (AA)-enhanced CQDs had the enhanced fluorescence intensity, and different response characteristics. In addition, the (AA)-enhanced CQDs showed more sensitive and specific fluorescence response to Hg than simple ones, with a detection limit of 6.32\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fnmol\u00b7L. A linear response range from 2.00\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fmol\u00b7L to 6.00\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fmol\u00b7L was also achieved. The (AA)-enhanced CQDs also demonstrate good stability. They could effectively sense the Hg in complex samples including waste water, tea and rice. Therefore, these versatile (AA)-enhanced CQDs fluorescence method hold a promising potential in other promising applications such as pharmaceutical quality, environmental quality, and food safety monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, a novel \u201coff\u2013on\u201d sensor based on water-soluble fluorescent CdTe quantum dots (QDs) was established for the analysis of interactions between nano-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)porphyrins (TPP\u2013OCH 3  NPs) and various DNA structures, including single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, and G-quadruplexes. QD fluorescence can be quenched by TPP\u2013OCH 3  NPs via photo-induced electron transfer, and the interaction between TPP\u2013OCH 3  NPs and different DNA structures releases QDs from their quenchers and emits fluorescence with different intensities. The proposed \u201coff\u2013on\u201d method was employed to investigate the parameters, such as base composition, strand length, and spatial configurations, that may affect the interactions between TPP\u2013OCH 3  NPs and different DNA structures. Furthermore, the dynamic conversion of G-quadruplex configurations was observed using the proposed sensors. All studied G-quadruplex configurations could be qualitatively and quantitatively identified through chemometric methods with a detection limit of 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u221210  mol\u00b7L \u22121  and a recognition rate of 95.08%. The established detection method provides a new perspective of, as well as guidance for, the water-soluble application of oil-soluble drugs and the rapid analysis of different DNA structures in vitro.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this letter, the electronic structure properties of Nb, F monodoping and Nb-F codoping are explored by first-principles calculations. Our results show that Nb-F codoping can reduce the band gap notably. The band edge analysis indicates that both conduction band maximum (CBM) and valence band minimum (VBM) move to higher energies, which is desirable for water splitting. The formation energy and pair binding energy calculation shows that this anion-cation codoping is easy to realize in both O-rich and O-poor conditions. The calculated optical absorption spectra indicate that the visible light absorption can be significantly improved by Nb-F codoping in WO 3 . Therefore, Nb-F co-doped WO 3  is predicted to be a promising visible light photocatalyst for water splitting.",

The electronic structure and formation energies of Mg substituting Cr-site, N substituting O-site, and co-doping of both Mg on Cr-site and N on O-site in CuCrO 2  are calculated. It is found that the structure with N and Mg codoped at the nearest sites has the lowest energy due to a modest attractive interaction between the two dopants. Compared with single N or Mg doped CuCrO 2 , the N\u2013Mg codoped CuCrO 2  has a lower formation energy and shallower transition level. In addition, the total density of states (DOS) analysis shows that more hole states appear above the Fermi level and higher DOS for N\u2013Mg co-doping is obtained in the N\u2013Mg codoped CuCrO 2 , which is good to enhance the  p -type conductivity in CuCrO 2 .",

It was found that biaxial strain can be a powerful tool to fine-tune the band structure and thermoelectric properties of stannite-type Cu2ZnSnSe4, and the enhancement of thermoelectric properties can be explained from the convergence of the valence bands near the Fermi level. The study offers valuable insight into band engineering via biaxial strain for improving thermoelectric performance of quaternary chalcogenides and similar materials.",

Compared to the pure P25, the MoS 2 /P25 exhibited improved photocatalytic degradation activity under simulated sunlight with rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) as the target pollutants. RhB or MB (40\u00a0mL 10\u00a0mg/L) completely degraded within 20\u00a0min, and the kinetic constant reached 0.221 and 0.253\u00a0min \u22121  for RhB and MB, respectively. Based on the characterization of transient photocurrent response measurement and UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra, a possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. The enhanced photocatalytic performance was attributed to the heterostructure of P25 and MoS 2  nanodots, improving their charge separation and enhancing their absorption capacity to the full sunlight spectrum. We believe that this study will contribute to the development of new photocatalysts and improving the catalytic performance of traditional photocatalysts.",

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the morphologies, microstructures and compositions of the nanocomposites. The effect of GO on the sensing performances of the nanocomposites was investigated. It was found that 10\u00a0wt% GO was the optimized loading and the response value reached 35.8 under the exposure of 100\u00a0ppm acetone. The unique sensing properties were attributed to the synergistic effects of rigid ZnO nanosheets and flexible GO, including large specific surface area, rich functional groups of GO etc. This work will contribute to the development of new acetone sensors and broaden the application of GO composite materials.",

        "abstract": "Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) patients have normal thyroid hormone levels but increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level in serum. It has been reported that high TSH is related to abnormal skeletal development in mice with hypothyroidism. However, the cellular mechanism is not fully understood. In the present study, we aim to investigate the direct effects of TSH stimulation on chondrocytes, and the putative role of autophagy in this process. By using EdU incorporation assay and flow cytometry for mitochondrial membrane potential assay, we demonstrated deceased proliferation and promoted apoptosis in TSH stimulated primary mouse chondrocytes. And the balance of Bcl-2 and BAX expression on protein level was broken. More interestingly, the expression of autophagic markers Beclin-1 and LC3II was reduced in TSH stimulated chondrocytes, accompanied by less autophagosomes and accumulated p62 protein, indicating an impaired autophagic flux. More interestingly, mTOR was upregulated and AMPK activity was decreased in TSH stimulated PMCs, suggesting that mTOR/AMPK pathway is get involved in the regulation of TSH on autophagy in PMCs. Collectively, we found an increased apoptosis and suppressed autophagy in TSH stimulated primary chondrocytes, which is meaningful in understanding the effects of increased TSH level on articular cartilage and the role of autophagy in this process, and thus provide a potential novel therapeutic target in related cartilage damages.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Objective  Insulin resistance is correlated with the progress of albuminuria in diabetic patients, and podocytes are crucial for maintaining the normal function of the glomerular filtration barrier. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the high glucose-induced insulin resistance and cell injury in human podocytes and the putative role of autophagy in this process.    Methods  Human podocytes were cultured in high glucose-supplemented medium and low glucose and high osmotic conditions were used for the controls. Autophagy in the podocytes was regulated using rapamycin or 3-methyladenine stimulation. Next, autophagy markers including LC3B, Beclin-1, and p62 were investigated using western blot and qPCR, and the insulin responsiveness was analyzed based on glucose uptake and by using the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor with Nephrin as a podocyte injury marker.    Results  The basal autophagy level decreased under the high glucose conditions, which was accompanied by a decrease in the glucose uptake and phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in the human podocytes. More interestingly, the glucose uptake and the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor were decreased by 3-MA stimulation and increased by rapamycin, illustrating that the responsiveness of insulin was regulated by autophagy. The activation of autophagy by rapamycin also ameliorated cell injury in the human podocytes.    Conclusions  The presence or activation of autophagy was found to play a protective role in human podocytes against high glucose-induced insulin resistance and cell injury, which indicates a novel cellular mechanism and provides a potential therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy (DN).",

Building on a multi-year engagement at Za'atari, we developed an information-enabled community engagement approach to identify and address challenges at the camp, engage community members in problem solving and increase self- reliance. Using HCI mixed methods, we facilitated the creation of a community-commissioned database of household assets, being implemented by the UNHCR with potential for adoption in other refugee camps. Our main contributions are participatory approaches to understanding information behaviors within a fragmented social fabric in high-constraint, low-affordance settings resulting from armed conflict.

        "abstract": "Despite the appearance of uniform availability of mobile services, in many locales granular network analyses reveal the persistence of physical access divides. It stands to reason these divides, similar to those at larger scales, are also reflections of community-level social and economic divides. In this research, we examine community-level physical access divides in the context of a Syrian refugee camp. The investigation combines detailed network and organizational analyses to characterize the divides and identify factors influencing their creation and potential solutions. Our findings show that even in the limited confines of a refugee camp, coverage patterns and bandwidth availability differ significantly both within and between the networks of three mobile cellular carriers. These patterns, together with the overall configuration of network infrastructure, demonstrate three community level divides: an inter-carrier congestion divide, a spatial distribution divide, and an inter-network divide. We identify a number of linkages between these divides and the social, organizational and humanitarian context of the camp. Building on these analyses, we provide recommendations to ameliorate these divides for both residents and camp management.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we examine refugees' use of mobile communication and Internet services. Our findings are based on survey data collected at Za'atari Syrian refugee camp in Jordan, providing systematic quantitative analyses to complement anecdotal accounts reported in the media. More importantly, our findings directly inform humanitarian program development and may be used to develop related information services. First, in terms of frequency of use, we find that social media are used more frequently than SMS, mobile voice, Skype and email. Second, through multivariate regression with demographic variables, we find that sex is a significant predictor of the type of communication service, which differs depending on recipient location. Third, we identified the three most popular information sources are Google, Facebook and YouTube Lastly, we discuss how these findings, in particular, highlighting the heterogeneity of refugee ICT use and online interests, can inform information service design.",

In this study we introduce a co-located social media app called SpeakUp to a community building project in the Zau0027atari Syrian refugee camp in Jordan. To overcome issues such as the lack of Internet access, we purposefully adapted the design of the application and ported its server to a low cost single board computer on a Raspberry Pi. We explore the effects of SpeakUp through field experiments with one control and two treatment groups, as well as with interviews and observations. Our results show that SpeakUp significantly increases refugeesu0027 level of participation and sense of community. Importantly, with the use of the application, female and male participants demonstrate no significant differences in participation, showing that the use of such applications can be equalizing. We also found that co-located social media supports asynchronous interaction when outside-the-classroom activities are involved.",

This paper explores the feasibility and effects of a data-driven asset mapping system as a community building tool in a refugee camp. Guided by participatory community building methods, We push the bounds of established ABCD methods by engaging community participants throughout the entire process of designing and collecting, but also managing, analyzing, and potentially applying the asset data. We use mixed methods, which include field notes, surveys, and focus groups to investigate whether asset data can be mobilized by the community itself, rather than by staff, to address its challenges and, if so, possible strategies for community members to utilize such data. Our three findings include: 1. refugees in our study had the capacity to collect and up-and-download asset data, 2. However, they lack technical and statistical skills to utilize the data most effectively and 3. Nevertheless, the process of collecting data contributed to a sense of community at the classroom level. Based on these findings, we offer several recommendations for use of data-driven ABCD in low-resource contexts.",

        "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which have little or no protein-coding capacity, caught a particular interest since their potential roles in the cancer paradigm. As the most common cancer in women, cervical squamous cell carcinoma remains one of the leading causes of deaths from cancer. However, limited evidence is available to determine the role of lncRNAs in the prognosis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we collected lncRNA expression profiling to identify prognosis related lncRNAs for cervical squamous cell carcinoma from TCGA database. In addition, we developed a 15-lncRNA signature based risk score to comprehensively assess the prognostic function of lncRNA. Furthermore, we performed a ROC analysis to identify the optimal cut-off point for classification risk level of the patients. Univariate Cox regression models were used to assess the association between lncRNAs and prognosis of patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma. A 15-lncRNA based risk score was developed based on the Cox co-efficient of the individual lncRNAs. The prognostic value of this risk score was validated in the complete set and internal testing set. In summary, a 15-lncRNA expression signature (BAIAP2-AS1, RP11-203J24.8, LINC01133, RP1-7G5.6, RP11-147L13.15, SERHL, CTC-537E7.3, RP11-440L14.1, RP11-131N11.4, ILF3-AS1, RP11-80H18.4, RP11-1096G20.5, CTD-2192J16.26, RP11-621L6.3, and RP11-571M6.18) were identified and validated which can predict cervical cancer patient survival. The potential functions of this 15-lncRNA expression signature and individual lncRNAs as prognostic targets of cervical cancer were revealed by this study. Furthermore, these findings may have important implications in the understanding of the potential therapeutic method for the cervical squamous cell carcinoma patients.",

Although long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in the initiation and progression of cancer, few studies focus on the lncRNAs in the cervical cancer. Here, we systematically studied the clinical information, transcriptome profiling, and methylation array data of cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma that retrieved from genomic data commons (GDC). Compared with protein-coding genes, the expression levels of pseudogenes and lncRNAs were much lower. A total of 190 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 2,326 protein-coding genes were identified. Meanwhile, 269 differentially methylation regions (DMRs), where 16 lncRNAs were located, were figured out. Only one lncRNA, LINC00592, which was located in the DMRs, was also found differentially expressed. Several transcriptional regulation genes, such as ZNF20, ZNF441, ZNF573, and TMF1, were highly correlated with the expression of LINC00592, which illustrated its possible function on the transcription. Two microRNAs, which were both associated with tumor progression, can bind to LINC00592. Moreover, LINC00592 were also differentially expressed in other tumors. We proposed, with the help of various databases, that LINC00592 is a potential cancer-related lncRNA in cervical cancer and might activate the cancer progression through the regulation of transcription or structural integrity.",

        "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs have been reported to play crucial roles in tumorigenesis including cervical cancer. LINC00037 has been identified as a significant regulator in several cancers. Our study was aimed to investigate the function of LINC00037 in cervical cancer progression. LINC00037 was significantly downregulated in human cervical cancer cells (HeLa, HCC94, HT-3, Caski, and SiHa cells) compared with the ectocervical epithelial cells (End1/E6E7 cells). Overexpression of LINC00037 was able to inhibit cervical cancer cell proliferation, induce cell apoptosis, and restrain the cell migration/invasion capacity. Reversely, knockdown of LINC00037 exhibited an opposite process in vitro. mTOR has been recognized as an atypical serine/threonine kinase that is involved in regulating significant cellular functions. In our present study, we observed that the mTOR signaling pathway was strongly activated in human cervical cancer cells. Meanwhile, upregulation of LINC00037 contributed to the inactivation of mTOR signaling whereas downregulation of LINC00037 activated the pathway. Subsequently, in vivo animal models using SiHa cells were established and we proved that LINC00037 repressed cervical cancer progression via targeting the mTOR signaling pathway. All these findings implied that LINC00037 could regulate cervical cancer pathogenesis via mTOR signaling. In conclusion, a novel role of LINC00037 was manifested in cervical cancer progression.",

        "abstract": "NEAT1 is an important tumor oncogenic gene in various tumors. Nevertheless, its involvement remains poorly studied in cervical cancer. Our study explored the functional mechanism of NEAT1 in cervical cancer. NEAT1 level in several cervical cancer cells was quantified and we found NEAT1 was greatly upregulated in vitro. NEAT1 knockdown inhibited cervical cancer development through repressing cell proliferation, colony formation, capacity of migration, and invasion and also inducing the apoptosis. For another, microRNA (miR)-133a was downregulated in cervical cancer cells and NEAT1 negatively modulated miR-133a expression. Subsequently, we validated that miR-133a functioned as a potential target of NEAT1. Meanwhile, SOX4 is abnormally expressed in various cancers. SOX4 was able to act as a downstream target of miR-133a and silencing of SOX4 can restrain cervical cancer progression. In addition, in vivo assays were conducted to prove the role of NEAT1/miR-133a/SOX4 axis in cervical cancer. These findings implied that NEAT1 served as a competing endogenous RNA to sponge miR-133a and regulate SOX4 in cervical cancer pathogenesis. To sum up, it was implied that NEAT1/miR-133a/SOX4 axis was involved in cervical cancer development.",

According to pattern recognition analysis, there was a clear separation among big platform group (BP), sleep deprivation group (SD), and the CGA (model\u2009+\u2009CGA), and CGA group was much closer to the BP group by showing a tendency of recovering towards BP group. Thirty-six significantly changed metabolites related to antidepressant by CGA were identified and used to explore the potential mechanism. Combined with the result of the classic behavioral tests and biochemical indices, CGA has significant antidepressant effects in a rat model of SD, suggesting that the mechanism of action of CGA might be involved in regulating the abnormal pathway of nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; and arginine and proline metabolism. Our results also show that metabolomics analysis based on GC-MS is a useful tool for exploring biomarkers involved in depression and elucidating the potential therapeutic mechanisms of Chinese medicine.",

In this study, serum and brain metabolomic method based on gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was employed to evaluate the efficacy and study the mechanism of GS on a rat model of SD. With pattern recognition analysis of serum and brain tissue metabolite profile, a clear separation of the model group and control group was acquired for serum and brain tissue samples; the MGS (model\u2009+\u2009GS) group showed a tendency of recovering when compared to control group, which was consistent with behavioral and biochemical parameters. 39 and 40 potential biomarkers of brain tissues and serum samples, respectively, were identified and employed to explore the possible mechanism.

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic recurring illness that seriously affects human health. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), an important polyphenol extracted from Eucommia ulmoides Oliver bark, has been reported to have anti-depression, neuroprotection, memory improvement and other pharmacological effects. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of CGA on the treatment of depression. Here, we investigated the antidepressant-like effects of CGA on an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-treated rat model. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal diet group (N), ACTH-treated model group (M), memantine positive control group (M + Mem) and CGA intervened group (M + CGA). Sucrose preference tests (SPTs) and open-field tests (OFTs) were performed to evaluate depressive-like behaviors. Memantine (30 mg kg\u22121) and CGA (500 mg kg\u22121) administration dramatically increased hedonic behaviors of the rats in SPT. The scores of crossing and rearing were significantly increased in the M + Mem group and M + CGA group. These results of the behaviour tests might be suggestive of antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, memantine and CGA reversed the levels of serum 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), ACTH, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and dopamine (DA) that were altered in ACTH-treated rats. Based on a GC-MS metabolomic approach, significant differences in the metabolic profile were observed in ACTH-treated rats compared with the control group, as well as the M + CGA group and M + Mem group compared with the ACTH-treated group. A total of 19 metabolites were identified for the discrimination of normal rats and ACTH-treated rats, and 12 out of 19 differential metabolites were reversed with CGA intervention. Combined with pattern recognition and bioinformatics, nine perturbed metabolic pathways, including energy metabolism, neurotransmitter metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, were identified based on these metabolites. These integrative studies might give a holistic insight into the pathophysiological mechanism of the ACTH-treated depressive rat model, and also showed that CGA has antidepressant-like activities in ACTH-treated rats, providing an important drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of tricyclic anti-depressant treatment-resistant depression.",

        "abstract": "Electronic books (e-books) with audio narration are often touted as enabling pre-literate children to read independently, which, indeed, is the most common way children utilized e-books in the U.S. However, young children may have trouble navigating e-books, as their cognitive and fine motor skills are still developing. Compared to print-books, e-books lack the tactability and tangibility of print books and thus may pose additional challenge to book navigation. To examine this issue, we randomly assigned 174 children aged 3-5 to be read either a print book by an adult (n = 85) or an e-book with audio narration (n = 89) and compared their page-turning behaviors, including disruptive turning (i.e., turning before narration ends), delayed turning (i.e., being inattentive for over one minute after the narration ends), and incorrect page-turning motions. We found that screen-based reading imposes additional cost to children's navigation of the book, especially for children under four years old and those who are less experienced with tablet devices. The learning curve to navigate e-books appears to be steeper than that for print-books. Future e-book design may want to provide scaffolding for young users and those lacking familiarity with touchsreen technologies.\n\n",

This study focuses on the analysis of the gait kinematics parameters of normal adults' gait, aiming to investigate the characteristics of gait parameters in different age groups and to explore the role of gait parameters in motor function assessment and clinical diagnosis. Based on the gait data gained by electronic walkway, the relationship among the toe out angles and their correlation with age and gender etc. were quantitatively analyzed. The results show that most normal subjects walk with positive toe out angles, and the angles increase with age. Such changes are slow in the young and middle age groups. However, the elevations of the left out toe angle and the angles between the feet are statistically significant after entering elder age ( >60 years). The results also suggest that the angle between the feet is a kind of practical gait parameter for varying applications. This study concludes that feet angle analysis is potential to provide a convenient and quantitative tool for the assessment of lower limb motor ability and the diagnosis of knee joint diseases.",

        "title": "Security-Enhanced Wireless Multicast via Adaptive Fountain Codes over Distributed Caching Network.",
        "abstract": "With the kept-increasing interconnecting capability over Internet, distributed caching techniques can be applied for secure data storage. In particular, the entire data file of interests is stored in multiple distributed servers with each caching only a random part of the file. In this scenario, an attacker needs to intrude multiple servers to steal the whole file. If the legitimate receivers typically use mobile terminals such as smart phones, the attacker inclines to eavesdrop on open wireless channels to steal the file more easily. To protect the data from overheard by eavesdroppers, we propose a dynamic fountain coding scheme for wireless access point, adapting to the cached contents in the current server and data-reception states. Our proposal focuses on the challenging wireless multicast transmission as it costs at more redundancy transmissions for error control. Besides the adaptive encoding design, we design an efficient server selection strategy to decrease the transmission delay and reduce the probability of successfully overhearing by eavesdroppers. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can efficiently achieve low eavesdropping probability and high transmission efficiency with a bit accredited complexity for distributed wireless caching network.",

        "title": "Security Enhancement for Multicast over Internet of Things by Dynamically Constructed Fountain Codes.",
        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to accommodate every object which exists in this world or likely to exist in the near future. The enormous scale of the objects is challenged by big security concerns, especially for common information dissemination via multicast services, where the reliability assurance for multiple multicast users at the cost of increasing redundancy and/or retransmissions also benefits eavesdroppers in successfully decoding the overheard signals. The objective of this work is to address the security challenge present in IoT multicast applications. Specifically, with the presence of the eavesdropper, an adaptive fountain code design is proposed in this paper to enhance the security for multicast in IoT. The main novel features of the proposed scheme include two folds: (i) dynamical encoding scheme which can effectively decrease intercept probability at the eavesdropper; (ii) increasing the transmission efficiency compared with the conventional nondynamical design. The analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance information security while achieving higher transmission efficiency with a little accredited complexity, thus facilitating the secured wireless multicast transmissions over IoT.",

        "abstract": "Oleanolic acid (OA), a naturally occurring triterpenoid, exhibits potential antitumor activity in several tumor cell lines. Although the inhibition effects of OA on proliferation and survival in human cancers have been confirmed, the potential mechanism underlying OA-induced osteosarcoma cell death has not yet been fully elucidated. Our results in this study showed that OA inhibits proliferation and viability of osteosarcoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry assays revealed that apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells was significantly induced by OA treatment, while this induction was blocked by Jagged1-mediated activation of Notch signaling. Western blot analysis and a mitochondrial membrane potential assay demonstrated that OA functions through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. More importantly, our data revealed that OA treatment interrupted the balance between pro-apoptotic factors and anti-apoptotic factors in osteosarcoma cells by inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway. These data suggest that OA induces osteosarcoma cell apoptosis by targeting mitochondria in a Notch signaling-dependent manner. Thus, OA may be a promising drug for adjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

In this study, JAG1-induced osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization has been analyzed in primary osteoblasts for up to 7 days. Alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin red staining showed an enhanced osteoblast maturation and mineralization in JAG1 treated cells, as well as higher mRNA levels of late osteoblast differentiation markers. In contrast, Notch inhibitor DAPT and deletion of Runx2 totally blocked JAG1 effects on osteoblast mineralization. Flow cytometry data further showed a significantly higher cell proliferation in early stages of culture at day 3, and lower levels of osteoblast apoptosis in late stages of culture at day 7. More importantly, activation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL-2 was enhanced, while pro-apoptotic factor Caspase3 was reduced in JAG1 treated osteoblasts. Therefore, we conclude that cell mineralization is enhanced via anti-apoptotic actions of Notch signaling within the osteoblast cells.",

A limiting factor in their application is the loss of MSC multi-potency as a result of high density sheet culture-induced senescence. In the study reported in this article, we tested whether Notch activation could be used to prevent or delay sheet culture-induced cell aging. Our results showed that, during in vitro long-term (5-day) cell sheet culture, MSCs progressively lose their progenitor characteristics. In contrast, Notch activation by Jagged1 in MSC sheet culture showed reduced cellular senescence and cell cycle arrest compared with control MSCs without Notch activation. Importantly, knockdown of Notch target gene Hes1 totally blocked the inhibition effect of Jagged1 on cellular senescence. Finally, the in vivo allograft transplantation data showed a significant enhanced callus formation and biomechanical properties in Notch activation cultured long-term sheet groups when compared with long-term cultured sheet without Notch activation. Our results suggest that Notch activation by Jagged1 could be used to overcome the stem cell aging caused by high density sheet culture, thereby increasing the therapeutic potential of MSC sheets for tissue regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum (S. Gallinarum) and biovar Pullorum (S. Pullorum) are gram-negative bacteria, members of the most important infectious pathogens, and have caused common problems in the poultry industry, especially in the developing countries. O- and H-antigen specific anti-sera are commonly for slide and tube agglutination tests to identify Salmonella serovars. However, it is both labor intensive and time consuming, so there is an urgent need for a new technique for the rapid detection of the major Salmonella serovars. In this study, we developed a 1-step PCR assay to identify the serovar Gallinarum. This PCR-based assay was based on the SPUL_2693 gene, which was located in SPI-19 and found by comparing the genomes of the S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum in the whole data of NCBI. The specificity of this gene was evaluated by bioinformatics analysis, and the results showed that the SPUL_2693 gene exists in all serovar Gallinarum. The specificity and sensitivity of this PCR assay were evaluated in our study. The developed PCR assay was able to distinguish the serovar Gallinarum from 27 different Salmonella serovars and 5 different non-Salmonella pathogens. The minimum limit of genomic DNA of S. Pullorum for PCR detection was 2.143 pg/\u03bcL, and the minimum limit number of cells was 6 CFU. This PCR assay was also applied to analyze Salmonella strains isolated from a chicken farm in this study. The PCR assay properly identified the serovar Gallinarum from other Salmonella serovars, and the results were in agreement with the results of a traditional serotyping assay. In general, the newly developed PCR-based assay can be used to accurately judge the presence of the serovar Gallinarum and can be combined with traditional serotyping assays, especially in the case of large quantities of samples.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) plays a key antiviral role by promoting type I interferon production. We cloned the pigeon  TRAF3  gene ( PiTRAF3 ) according to its predicted mRNA sequence to investigate its function. The 1704-bp full-length open reading frame encodes a 567-amino acid protein. One Ring finger, two TRAF-type Zinc fingers, one Coiled coil, and one MATH domain were inferred. RT-PCR showed that  PiTRAF3  was expressed in all tissues, with relatively weak expression in the heart and liver. In HEK293T cells, over-expression of wild-type,  \u25b3 Ring,  \u25b3 Zinc finger, and  \u25b3 Coiled coil PiTRAF3, but not a  \u25b3 MATH form, significantly increased IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity. Zinc finger and Coiled coil domains were essential for NF-\u03baB activation. In chicken HD11\u00a0cells, PiTRAF3 increased IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity and four domains were all contributing. R848 stimulation of pigeon peripheral blood mononuclear cells and splenocytes significantly increased expression of  PiTRAF3  and the inflammatory cytokine genes  CCL5 ,  IL-8 , and  IL-10 . These data demonstrate TRAF3u0027s innate immune function and improve understanding of its involvement in poultry antiviral defense.",

TRAF6 plays critical roles in innate immune response and regulates function of antigen-presenting cells. Here, we cloned the goose TRAF6 (goTRAF6) gene from a healthy Yangzhou great white goose (Anser anser), which had a typical TRAF structure and shared a high-sequence identity with TRAF6 of other birds. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that goTRAF6 mRNA was broadly expressed in all the studied tissues, with highest expression in the heart and pectoral muscle. Overexpression of goTRAF6 caused NF-\u03baB activation in a dose-dependent manner and substantially upregulated IFN-\u03b2 expression in HEK293T cells. Following Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand stimulation of goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells, goTRAF6 and downstream inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels considerably up-regulated, especially at early stages. Salmonella Enteritidis challenge caused overexpression of goTRAF6 and cytokine mRNA in all the examined organs. These findings demonstrated that goTRAF6 played a substantial role in TLR-TRAF6 signaling cascade, and further contributed to the antibacterial-responses in host.",

        "abstract": "In medicine and chemistry, immunoassays are often used to measure substance concentration. These tests use an S-shaped standard curve to map the observed optical responses to the underlying concentration. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is one such test that is commonly used to measure antibody concentration in vaccine and infectious disease research. The enzyme-linked im- munosorbent assay and other immunoassays usually involve a series of doubling or tripling dilutions of the test samples so that some of the diluted samples fall within the near-linear range in the center of the standard curve. The dilution that falls within or is nearest to the center of the near-linear range may then be selected for statistical analysis. This common practice of using one dilution does not fully use the information from multiple dilutions and reduces accuracy. We describe a recently proposed weighted-average estimation approach for analyzing multiple-dilution data (Cheung et al. 2015, Journal of Immunological Methods 417: 115\u2013123), and we present the new wavemid command, which carries out the approach. We also present the new command midreshape, which processes raw data in text format exported from some microplate readers into analyzable data format. We use data from an experimental study of malaria vaccine candidates to demonstrate use of the two commands. Copyright 2016 by StataCorp LP.",

        "abstract": "Medical studies often define binary end-points by comparing the ratio of a pair of measurements at baseline and end-of-study to a clinically meaningful cut-off. For example, vaccine trials may define a response as at least a four-fold increase in antibody titers from baseline to end-of-study. Accordingly, sample size is determined based on comparisons of proportions. Since the pair of measurements is quantitative, modeling the bivariate cumulative distribution function to estimate the proportion gives more precise results than using dichotomization of data. This is known as the distributional approach to the analysis of proportions. However, this can be complicated by interval-censoring. For example, due to the nature of some laboratory measurement methods, antibody titers are interval-censored. We derive a sample size formula based on the distributional approach for paired interval-censored data. We compare the sample size requirement in detecting an intervention effect using the distributional approach to a conventional approach of dichotomization. Some practical guidance on applying the sample size formula is given.",
