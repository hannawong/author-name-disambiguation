        "abstract": "A novel range-free localization approach, Smallest Enclosing Circle based Localization (SECL), has been proposed. This approach uses the center of smallest enclosing circle of neighboring anchor nodes to estimate the position of target. Comparing to Centroid, SECL considers the geometrical coverage of anchors rather than the mass center of them. Consequently, SECL is robust to imperfect topology, especially when the topology of anchors is depolyed unevenly. Simulation results show that SECL outperforms Centroid by an average of 10%, and even better when the topology is not uniform.",

        "abstract": "Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) has become a serious concern for the lifetime reliability of integrated circuits. On-line aging prediction is a promising way to prevent NBTI-induced circuit failure. However, the ever-increasing parameter variations, design complexity and area overhead degrade the effectiveness of such delay detection-based scheme. In this paper, we propose to use the isolated leakage change in critical path from full-chip leakage measurement result to predict NBTI-induced circuit aging. The chip-level leakage changes under a set of measurement vectors are firstly formulated as an equation set. Solving this equation set can obtain leakage changes in the gates along the critical path. Then, we predict delay degradation on arbitrary critical path based on the correlation between leakage change and delay increase. Our scheme is immune to the runtime noise and accommodates process variation by increasing measurement time overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively predict NBTI-induced circuit aging with acceptable accuracy loss.",

Thus, the proposed OCDM circuit can achieve a large delay measurement range with a small quantity of delay stages. A calibration circuit is incorporated into the proposed on-chip path delay measurement technique to calibrate the delay range of the delay stage under process variations.

        "abstract": "Link quality is one of the most important factors that affect the performance of wireless networks. In a densely deployed wireless network, continuous link quality monitoring consumes significant amount of energy and bandwidth at each node. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity model and a spatial correlation model that can be used to derive a set of deputy links to monitor, instead of monitoring all of the links in the network. The proposed scheme can improve energy efficiency of the link quality monitoring process. A greedy algorithm is presented to derive the deputy links set based on three different optimization objective functions. Performance of the proposed method is studied extensively and it is shown that the proposed method can save almost 90% energy in typical simulation scenarios than the method of monitoring all links. We also demonstrate that the energy consumption of the greedy deputy set-based method is upper-bounded. Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

However, such techniques usually add additional compression and decompression latency to the critical path of memory access, which is one of the major factors limiting their application to processors. In contrast to prior work that deals with either cache compression or network compression separately, this study proposes a unified on-chip DIStributed data COmpressor, DISCO, to enable near-zero latency cache/NoC compression for chip multi-processors (CMPs) adopting Non-Uniform Cache Access (NUCA). DISCO integrates data compressors into NoC routers and seeks opportunity to overlap the de/compression latency with the NoC queuing delay through a coordinated NoC scheduling and cache compression mechanism With the support of DISCO that unifies the solutions of on-chip data compression, it is shown in evaluation that DISCO significantly boosts the efficiency of on-chip data caching and data moving.",

A combinational equivalence checking method based on incremental satisfiability is presented. This method chooses the candidate equivalent pairs with some new techniques, and uses incremental satisfiability algorithm to improve its performance. By substituting the internal equivalent pairs and converting the equivalence relations into conjunctive normal form (CNF) formulas, this approach can avoid the false negatives, and reduce the search space of SAT procedure. Experimental results on ISCAS\u201985 benchmark circuits show that, the presented approach is faster and more robust than those existed in literature. This paper also presents an algorithm for extracting of unsatisfiable core, which has an important application in abstraction and refinement for model checking to alleviate the state space explosion bottleneck. The error of approximate extraction is analyzed by means of simulation. An analysis reveals that an interesting phenomenon occurs, with the increasing density of the formula, the average error of the extraction is decreasing. An exact extraction approach for MU subformula, referred to as pre-assignment algorithm, is proposed. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that it is more efficient.",

In this paper, we propose a novel bit vector based two-dimensional packet classification algorithm called Group Bit Vector. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is its ability to set the length of the bit vector to perform AND operation (the operation bit vector) regardless of the size of rule databases by effectively aggregating the rules and constructing particular groups of a limited number of members. Moreover, the proposed algorithm avoids the problem of false matches, which may be brought by rules aggregation. Thus, the length of the operation bit vector can be adjusted to be suitable to the width of memories to improve the performance. Experimental results demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Statistical timing models have been proposed to describe delay variations in very deep sub-micron process technologies, which have increasingly significant influence on circuit performance. Under a statistical timing model, testing of a path can detect potential delay failures caused by different small delay defects. Due to path correlations, the potential delay failures captured by two different paths overlap between each other more or less. It is difficult to find a given number of paths that can capture most potential delay failures. In this paper, the path selection problem is converted to a minimal space intersection problem, and a greedy path selection heuristics is proposed, the key point of which is to calculate the probability that the paths in a specified path set all meet the delay constraint. Statistical timing analysis technologies and heuristics are used in the calculation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is time-efficient and achieves a higher probability of capturing delay failures in comparison with conventional path selection approaches.",

As a result, it is often very difficult to find issues that arise during their development and deployment. Visualization is an attractive and popular way to understand behaviours of complex systems. Visualization platform is therefore a key issue to develop WSNs applications. In this paper, our self-developed sensor network analysis and management platform (SNAMP), a novel multi-sniffer and multi-view visualization platform for WSNs is proposed and implemented. In SNAMP, data emitted by individual sensor nodes is collected by a multi-sniffer data collation network and passed to a flexible multi-view visualization mechanism. SNAMP indicates network topology, sensing data, network performance, hardware resource depletion, and other abnormalities in WSNs and allows developers adding application specific visualization functions, which will facilitate the research and development of various sensor networks and shorter the time from laboratory to applications",

        "abstract": "A new localization method is proposed for wireless sensor networks. The method uses iterative localization algorithm and distributed clustering scheme to decrease generated communication packets and increase the locating accuracy. The clustering scheme, named virtual cluster shift (VCS), makes self-organized sensor nodes of a wireless sensor network dynamically build one or more virtual clusters to localize and track mobile targets. When one or more sensors detect a target, a sensor node is selected to be the cluster head. The cluster head is in charge of organizing neighboring sensors to form a virtual cluster, fusing data and estimating the target\u2019s states such as location, velocity of mobile target. When the target is moving out of the monitor area of current virtual cluster, the cluster head gives place to one of his cluster member who is the nearest to the target. The new cluster head forms his virtual cluster by replacing some of the old cluster members. A mean shift based algorithm is used to iteratively estimating the target\u2019s position using data gathered inside virtual cluster.

Effective defect tolerance techniques are essential to improve the yield of such complex integrated circuits.

When faulty cores existing on-chip in this architecture, how to reconfigure the processor with the most effective topology is a relevant research problem. We present novel solutions for this problem, which not only maximize the performance of the manycore processor, but also provide a unified topology to operating system and application software running on the processor.

Through-silicon via (TSV) is considered to be the most promising technology for 3D integration, however, TSV pads distributed across planar layers occupy significant chip area and result in routing congestions. In addition, the yield of 3D integrated circuits decreased dramatically as the number of TSVs increases. For symmetric 3D mesh NoC, we observe that the TSVs' utilization is pretty low and adjacent routers rarely transmit packets via their vertical channels (i.e. TSVs) at the same time. Based on this observation, we propose a novel TSV squeezing scheme to share TSVs among neighboring router in a time division multiplex mode, which greatly improves the utilization of TSVs. Experimental results show that the proposed method can save significant TSV footprint with negligible performance overhead.",

        "abstract": "Phase change memory (PCM) is a promising alternative to Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) as main memory due to its merits of high density and low leakage power. Multi-level Cell (MLC) PCM is more attractive than Single-level Cell (SLC) PCM, because it can store multiple bits per cell to achieve higher density and lower per-bit cost. With the iterative program-verify write technique, MLC PCM writes demand at much higher power than DRAM writes, while the power supply system of MLC memory system is similar to that of DRAM, and the power capability is limited. The incompatibility of high write power and limited power budget results in the degradation of the write throughput and performance in MLC PCM. In this work, we investigate both write scheduling policy and power management to improve the MLC power utility and alleviate the negative impacts induced by high write power. We identify the power-utility-driven write scheduling as an online bin-packing problem and then derive a power-utility-driven scheduling (PUDS) policy from the First Fit algorithm to improve the write power usage. Based on the ramp-down characteristic of the SET pulse (the pulse changes the PCM to high resistance), we propose the SET Power Amortization (SPA) policy, which proactively reclaims the power tokens at the intra-SET level to promote the power utilization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the PUDS and SPA respectively achieve 24% and 27% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art power management technique, and the PUDS8SPA has an overall 31% improvement of the power utility and 50% increase of performance compared to the baseline system.",

        "abstract": "It is a well-known fact that test power consumption may exceed that during functional operation. Leakage power dissipation caused by leakage current in Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits during test has become a significant part of the total power dissipation. Hence, it is important to reduce leakage power to prolong battery life in portable systems which employ periodic self-test, to increase test reliability and to reduce test cost. This paper analyzes leakage current and presents a kind of leakage current simulator based on the transistor stacking effect. Using it, we propose techniques based on don't care bits (denoted by Xs) in test vectors to optimize leakage current in integrated circuit (IC) test by genetic algorithm. The techniques identify a set of don't care inputs in given test vectors and reassign specified logic values to the X inputs by the genetic algorithm to get minimum leakage vector (MLV). Experimental results indicate that the techniques can effectually optimize leakage current of combinational circuits and sequential circuits during test while maintaining high fault coverage.",

Yet, in IC design, due to limitation of linked list memory management and IC area, the implementation of linear allocation is more complex. In this paper, a novel bitmap approach is proposed for free memory management. With efficient search architecture, compression algorithm and pre-fetch buffer, the work complexity of bitmap approach can be reduced considerably, linear allocation can be implemented easily, and memory management can also be optimized to provide high effectiveness.",

Since circuit-width is a good measure of circuit complexity, we present a circuit-width based heuristic, which can be used to integrate the BDD technique and SAT technique for Boolean reasoning. The scheme switches one engine to another in terms of the circuit-width, thus it takes both advantages of these two engines. The circuit-width directed Boolean reasoning algorithm avoids the potential memory explosion caused by constructing the BDDs, and also prevents from the time-outs phenomenon of SAT techniques. In comparison with the previous heuristic schemes in literature, the new schemes can save more computational resources, and improve the performance of Boolean reasoning algorithms. On the automatic test pattern generation of combinational circuits, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed heuristic scheme can be applied in Boolean reasoning effectively.",

The method has no assumption on fault models, thus can diagnose arbitrary faults. To cope with the multiple-fault mask and reinforcement effect, two key techniques of construction and scoring of fault-tuple equivalence trees are introduced to choose and rank the final candidate locations. Experimental results show that, when the circuits have 2 arbitrary faults, the average diagnosability and resolution are 98% and 0.95, respectively, with the best case 100% and 1.00. Moreover, in average, even when 21 arbitrary faults exist, our method can still identify 93% of them with the resolution 0.78, increased by 41% and 39% in comparison with the latest work where the diagnosability and resolution are 66% and 0.56.

In the scenario of PIM-enabled system, current prefetching methods are likely to induce unnecessary data moving between memory and CPU, resulting in significant performance slow-down if ignoring the data access pattern of the In-Memory cores of PIM architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel PIM-oriented Prefetching (PIMCH), to fix this problem for the heterogeneous system with both conventional CPU cores and PIM architectures. PIMCH consider the memory behavior of both CPU cores and PIM cores, and refers to their data mapping to dynamically adjust prefetching methods, which enables cooperative memory prefetching in Processing-In-Memory architecture.\n\n",

        "abstract": "The field of image and video recognition has been propelled by the rapid development of deep learning in recent years. With its fascinating accuracy and generalization ability, deep CNNs have shown remarkable performance in large-scale and real-life image dataset. However, accommodating computation-intensive CNN-based image detection frameworks on power-constrained devices is considered more challenging than desktop or warehouse computing systems. Instead of emphasizing purely on detection accuracy, Low Power Image Recognition Challenge (LPIRC) is initiated to highlight the energy-efficiency of different image recognition solutions, and it witnesses the advancement of cost-effective image recognition technology in aspects of both algorithmic and architecture innovation. This paper introduces the cost-effective CNN-based object detection solutions that reached an improved tradeoff between energy and accuracy for mobile CPU+GPU SoCs, which is the winner of LPIRC2016, and it also analyzes the implications of both recent hardware and algorithm advancement on such a technique. It is demonstrated in our evaluation that the performance growth of embedded SoCs and CNN models have clearly contributed to a sheer growth of mAP/WH in current CNN-based object detection solutions, and also shifted the balance between accuracy and energy-cost in the contest solution design when we seek to maximize the efficiency score defined by LPIRC through design parameter exploration.",

        "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks are well-known for the extensive parameters and computation intensity. Structured pruning is an effective solution to obtain a more compact model for the efficient inference on GPGPUs, without designing specific hardware accelerators. However, previous works resort to certain metrics in channel/filter pruning and count on labor intensive fine-tunings to recover the accuracy loss. The \"inception\" of the pruned model, as another form factor, has indispensable impact to the final accuracy but its importance is often ignored in these works. In this paper, we prove that optimal inception will be more likely to induce a satisfied performance and shortened fine-tuning iterations. We also propose a reinforcement learning based solution, termed as HeadStart, seeking to learn the best way of pruning aiming at the optimal inception. With the help of the specialized head-start network, it could automatically balance the tradeoff between the final accuracy and the preset speedup rather than tilting to one of them, which makes it differentiated from existing works as well. Experimental results show that HeadStart could attain up to 2.25x inference speedup with only 1.16% accuracy loss tested with large scale images on various GPGPUs, and could be well generalized to various cutting-edge DCNN models.\n\n",

        "abstract": "It is obvious that scan testing is the prevalent design for testability (DFT) in very large scale integrated circuits test. However, scan architecture in digital circuits causes much power consumption because when scan vectors are loaded into a scan chain, the effect of scan-ripple propagates to the combinational logic and redundant switching occurs in the combinational gates during the entire vectors shifting period. Hence, low-power design becomes a challenge for scan test. In this paper, a low-power scan architecture-PowerCut is proposed for minimizing power consumption during scan test, which is based on scan chain modification techniques. Blocking logic using transmission gates is inserted into the scan chain to reduce the dynamic power in shift cycle. At the same time, based on minimum leakage vector, a controlling unit is inserted. It makes the circuit slip into low leakage state during shift cycle. Thus, leakage power is also decreased. Experiments results indicate that this architecture can effectually reduce the power during scan test, and it has little improvement in area or delay overhead, compared with other low cost existing methods.",

        "abstract": "3-D technology that stacks silicon dies with through silicon vias (TSVs) is a promising solution to overcome the interconnect scaling problem in giga-scale integrated circuits (ICs). Thermal dissipation is a major challenge for 3-D integration and prior thermal-balanced task scheduling methods for 3-D multiprocessor system-on-chips (MPSoCs) typically balance power gradient across vertical stacks based on the assumption of strong thermal correlation among processing cores within a stack. On the other hand, 3-D MPSoCs typically employ network-on-chip (NoC) as the communication infrastructure which consumes a large portion of the energy budget. As TSVs consume much less energy than horizontal links in 3-D MPSoCs when transmitting the same amount data due to the reduced interconnect distance between vertical adjacent cores, it motivates to allocate heavily communicating tasks within the same vertical stack as much as possible, and thus traffic is restricted in the third dimension to reduce interconnect energy. However, aggregating active tasks within the same stack probably exacerbates the power density and result in hot spots. In this paper, we explore the tradeoff between thermal and interconnect energy when allocating tasks in 3-D Homogeneous MPSoCs, and propose an efficient heuristic. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce interconnect energy by more than 25% on average with almost the same peak temperature when compared with prior thermal-balanced solutions.",

        "abstract": "This paper surveys how to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to hypothesize object location and categorization from images or videos in mobile heterogeneous SoCs. Recently a variety of CNN-based object detection frameworks have demonstrated both increasing accuracy and speed. Though they are making fast progress in high quality image recognition, state-of-the-art CNN-based detection frameworks seldom discuss their hardware-depended aspects and the cost-effectiveness of real-time image analysis in off-the-shelf low-power devices. As the focus of deep learning and convolutional neural nets is shifting to the embedded or mobile applications with limited power and computational resources, scaling down object detection framework and CNNs is becoming a new and important direction. In this work we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of state-of-the-art real-time object detection frameworks about their performance, cost-effectiveness/energy-efficiency (in the metric of mAP/Wh) in off-the-shelf mobile GPU devices. Based on the analysis results and observation in investigation, we propose to adjust the design parameters of such frameworks and employ a design space exploration procedure to maximize the energy-efficiency (mAP/Wh) of real-time object detection solution in mobile GPUs. As shown in the benchmarking result, we successfully boost the energy-efficiency of multiple popular CNN-based detection solutions by maximizing the utility of computation resources of SoC and trading-off between prediction accuracy and energy cost. In the second Low-Power Image Recognition Challenge (LPIRC), our system achieved the best result measured in mAP/Energy on the embedded Jetson TX1 CPU+GPU SoC.",

        "abstract": "Data sinking is one of the typical transmission patterns in WSN (wireless sensor network). There is inherent unbalanced traffic load distribution in such funnel like transmission. A case in hop-based sinking (HBS) model is found more intricate than simple thought that inner nodes burden more forwarding tasks, showing the inverse direction within the same hop level comparing with global trend. With a simple weighted average mechanism, a continuous gradient parameter is introduced, which will be dedicated to instructing how to forward data to sink in place of hop count, namely fine-grain gradient sinking (FGS). Through traffic analysis and detailed simulation, in FGS model the network turns out to be smoother on traffic load distribution and more efficient on data forwarding than that in HBS model.",

A new genetic selecting approach is presented to overcome the shortcoming of these two methods. First, it can be implemented at RT-level. Second, it uses state coverage as fitness function, which is useful to test the control-part of the circuit. Third, it can test the control part and data part of circuit at the same time. The concept about dynamic state transfer and static state transfer are also brought up in this paper to direct test pattern generation. Based on this approach, an ATPG tool named GRTT is developed. Experimental results on ITC99-benchmarks show that GRTT can get excellent results not only in coverage but also in run-time. In comparison with X-Pulling, an experimental RT-level ATPG system, GRTT runs faster.",

        "abstract": "As the feature size and threshold voltage reduce, leakage power dissipation becomes an important concern in SRAM-based FPGAs. This work focuses on reducing the leakage power in routing resources, and more specifically, the leakage power dissipated in the used part of FPGA device, which is known as the active leakage power. We observe that the leakage power in off-path transistors takes up most of the active leakage power in multiplexers that control routing, and strongly depends on Hamming distance between the state of the on-path input and the states of the off-path inputs. Hence, an off-path leakage power aware routing algorithm is proposed to minimize Hamming distance between the state of on-path input and the states of off-path inputs for each multiplexer. Experimental results on MCNC benchmark circuits show that, compared with the baseline VPR technique, the proposed off-path leakage aware routing algorithm can reduce active leakage power in routing resources by 16.79%, and the increment of critical-path delay is only 1.06%.",

NBTI degradation has strong dependence on input pattern and duty cycles. Based on this observation, we propose to apply multiple input vectors to the combination circuit in a non-uniform way during standby mode. Multiple input vectors can enhance the capability to control the circuit nodes, achieve smaller duty cycles to reduce the stress time of gates and thus mitigate static NBTI. A constrained multi-object optimization model is formalized to find the optimal combination of duty cycles for timing-critical paths, which in turn minimizes the increase of path delay. An ATPG-like procedure is then presented to generate the corresponding input vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the delay increase of timing-critical paths can be mitigated significantly under long time NBTI effect (10-year) by only applying a small number of vectors.",

        "abstract": "Prior research on energy-efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inference accelerators mostly focus on exploiting the model sparsity, i.e., zero patterns in weight and activations, to reduce the on-chip storage and computation overhead. In this work, we found in addition to zero patterns, a larger group of repetitive patterns and values exists in the working-set of CNN inference task, which is defined as computation redundancy and induces unnecessary performance and storage overhead in CNN accelerators. Based on this observation, we proposed a redundancy-free architecture that detects and eliminates the repetitive computation and storage patterns in CNN for more efficient network inference. The architecture consists of two parts: the off-line parameter analyzer that extracts the repetitive patterns in the 3D tensor of parameters, and the dataflow accelerator. The proposed accelerator at first preprocesses the weight patterns and the dynamically generated activations, and then cache these intermediate results in special P2-cache banks for further usage in convolution or full-connection stage. It is evaluated in experiments that the proposed Cavoluche architecture removes up to 89% of the repetitive operations from the layer inference process and reduce 77% of on-chip storage space to store both redundancy-free weight and activations. It is seen in experiments that the implementation of Cavoluche outperforms the state-of-the-art mobile GPGPU in both performance and energy-efficiency. When compared to the latest sparsity base accelerators, Cavoluche also achieves better operation elimination effects.\n\n",

And thus, they cannot locate the root causes of memory faults precisely. This paper provides an innovative state machine to check memory faults, which has three main contributions. Firstly, five concise formulas describing memory faults are given to make the mechanism of the state machine simple and flexible. Secondly, the state machine has the ability to locate the cause roots of the memory faults.

The scan shift power dominates the average test power\n and restricts clock frequency of the shift phase, leading to excessive thermal accumulation and long test time. This paper\n proposes a scan chain design technique to solve the above problems. Based on weighted transition metric (WTM), the proposed\n extended WTM (EWTM) that is utilized to guide the scan chain design algorithm can estimate the scan shift power in both the\n shift-in and shift-out phases. Moreover, the wire length overhead of the proposed scan chain design can also be reduced by\n the proposed distance of EWTM (DEWTM) metric.

Multi-level cell (MLC) PCM has the benefits of higher capacity and lower cost-per-bit due to store multiple bits in a single cell. However, MLC PCM employs an iterative write scheme, which is precise, reliable but slow, incurring adverse impact on the system performance. In this work, we analyzed the characteristics of the SET pulse in PCM, and modeled the relationship of the resistance and the SET pulse in MLC. Based on the analysis, we proposed a short SET pulse as an iterative pulse for MLC, so as to accelerate the MLC PCM write operation without the reliability degradation. Experimental results show that the Short-SET write scheme could effectively alleviate the long write problem of MLC PCM and improve the system performanceby 90%. Meanwhile, the write power is reduced by 23%.",

However, state-of-the-art deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are demanding so much on-chip storage and compute resources that they cannot be smoothly handled by low-power mobile or embedded systems. In order to fit large CNN models into mobile or more cutting-edge devices for IoT or cyberphysics applications, we proposed an efficient on-chip memory architecture for CNN inference acceleration, and showed its application to in-house single-instruction multiple-data structure machine learning processor. The redesigned on-chip memory subsystem, Memsqueezer, includes an active weight buffer and data buffer set that embraces specialized compression methods to reduce the footprint of CNN parameters (weights) and activation data, respectively. Memsqueezer buffer can compress the data and weight set according to the dataflow in computation, and it also includes a built-in redundancy detection mechanism that actively scans through the working-set of CNNs to boost their inference performance by eliminating the computation redundancy in CNN models. In our experiments, it is shown that the CNN processors with Memsqueezer buffers achieve more than    $2{times }$    performance improvement and reduces 85% energy consumption on average over the conventional buffer design with the same area budget.",

Though online thermal management techniques such as DVFS and task migration can mitigate the temperature issue, but usually incur significant performance penalty. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize temperature at the design stage. In this work, we propose the TeSHoP, a Temperature Sensing based Hotspot-Driven Placement technique for FPGAs. Firstly, the un-optimized circuit along with a sensor network is run in FPGA to obtain the real temperature profile of the circuit. Then, based on the temperature profile, we proceed a one-off adjustment of the circuit placement for hotspot optimization. The optimization is modeled as a Hyper Minimum Bipartite Matching problem for solving. We implement the whole optimization flow in a real FPGA, with extension of the VTR-to-Bitstream tool. Experimental results on Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA show that the reduction of peak temperature and the improvement of thermal uniformity can be up to 7.5\u00b0C and 13.9% respectively.",

The fault-tolerant routing scheme has been regarded as an effective mechanism to ensure the performance of 2D NoCs. In this paper, we propose a high-performance reliable routing scheme HARS, which is deadlock-free by obeying a mid-node-searching method raised for 3D Mesh NoCs without requiring any Virtual Channels (VCs). In HARS, we adopt DyADM routing, extending the classical 2D routing algorithm DyAD to 3D scenario in presence of permanent faults on the vertical links. HARS is able to support both one-fault and multi-fault models. The experimental results show that HARS has better performance, improved reliability and lower overhead compared to the state-of-the-art reliable routing schemes.",

Recent industry data reports that scan chain and its control logic could take as much as 30% silicon area, meanwhile, the scan chain failures account for almost 50% of chip failures. In this paper, we proposed a deterministic scan chain diagnosis pattern generation algorithm. Firstly, a circuit model is built for scan chain fault diagnosis. Based on this model, any existing stuck-at fault pattern generation tool can be employed to generate patterns. And then a fault response analysis method is proposed to reduce the number of candidate fault pairs so as to benefit the diagnosis timing overhead without any penalty on diagnosis quality.

Conventional power management approaches usually focus on certain functional components, either computation or communication hardware resources, trying to optimize its power consumption as much as possible, while leave the other part untouched. However, such unilateral power control concept, though has some potentials to contribute overall power reduction, cannot guarantee the optimal power efficiency of the chip. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative management approach, coordinating both Computation and Communication infrastructure in tandem, termed as CoCom. Apart from prior work that deals with power control separately, it leverages the correlations between the two parts, as the \"key chain\" to guide their respective power state coordination to the appropriate direction. Besides, it uses dedicated hybrid on-chip/off-chip mechanisms to minimize the control cost and simultaneously guarantee the effectiveness.

In this work, we leverage the reconfigurable capability of MLC STT-RAM to provide variable-precision data storage for popular machine learning architectures. The targeted STT-RAM memory design is able to transform between multiple work modes and adaptable to meet the varying quality constraint of approximate applications.

The proposed technique uses three slices as reference slices. If a scan slice is compatible to one of the reference slices, only two bits or four bits are needed to encode it. Otherwise, the scan slice will replace one reference slice. When a scan slice is compatible to multiple reference slices, a selective compatible merge strategy is proposed to further improve compression ratio.

        "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) have achieved great success in a broad range of applications. As NN-based methods are often both computation and memory intensive, accelerator solutions have been proved to be highly promising in terms of both performance and energy efficiency. Although prior solutions can deliver high computational throughput for convolutional layers, they could incur severe performance degradation when accommodating the entire network model, because there exist very diverse computing and memory bandwidth requirements between convolutional layers and fully connected layers and, furthermore, among different NN models. To overcome this problem, we proposed an elastic accelerator architecture, called SynergyFlow, which intrinsically supports layer-level and model-level parallelism for large-scale deep neural networks. SynergyFlow boosts the resource utilization by exploiting the complementary effect of resource demanding in different layers and different NN models. SynergyFlow can dynamically reconfigure itself according to the workload characteristics, maintaining a high performance and high resource utilization among various models. As a case study, we implement SynergyFlow on a P395-AB FPGA board. Under 100MHz working frequency, our implementation improves the performance by 33.8% on average (up to 67.2% on AlexNet) compared to comparable provisioned previous architectures.\n\n",

For some timing-balanced circuits, the numbers of candidate critical paths may be very large, and this will make Monte Carlo simulation based statistical timing analysis very inefficient. A fast path selection approach based on graph partition is proposed in this paper. First, a critical path graph (CPG) is generated to implicitly enumerate almost all candidate critical paths, and then the CPG is partitioned into several sub graphs which contain limited numbers of paths using two graph partition approaches. After that, Monte Carlo simulation is applied on each sub graph for path selection. At last, according to the partition topology of the CPG and path sets selected from each sub graph, a path set for the original CPG is generated using Union and Cartesian product operations for testing SDDs. Experimental results show that for circuits containing large numbers of candidate critical paths, the proposed path selection approach can reduce the CPU time significantly and maintain a higher probability of capturing delay failures compared to path selection methods based on general Monte Carlo simulation.",

        "abstract": "Faster than at-speed testing provides an effective way to detect small delay defects (SDDs). It requires test patterns to be delicately classified into groups according to the delay of sensitized paths. Each group of patterns is applied at certain frequency. In this paper, we propose to generate tests for faster than at-speed testing using path delay fault (PDF) model and single path sensitization criterion. An effective path selection and grouping method is introduced, which could quickly and accurately identify paths whose delay falls into a given delay span. Several techniques are used to improve the efficiency of the testable path selection procedure. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method could achieve high transition fault coverage and high test quality of SDDs with low CPU time.",

If faults happen in PUF during manufacturing, the security of whole chip will be threatened. Fault diagnosis plays an important role in the yield learning process. However, since different manufactured PUFs with the same design have different Challenge-Response Pairs (CRPs), which cannot be predicted, the traditional fault diagnosis method based on comparing the fault-free responses of a design and the failing responses of chips is no longer suitable for diagnosing PUF. Therefore, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method toward classic arbiter PUF. The stuck-at faults and the delay faults are considered. Based on the expected uniformity of arbiter PUF, a diagnostic challenge generation method and a corresponding CRP analysis method are proposed to distinguish faults within the arbiter PUF. Experimental results show that the diagnostic accuracy achieves 100.0% with good diagnostic resolution.",

In this paper, we present a new X-filling technique to reduce both shift power and capture power during scan tests, namely LSC-filling. The basic idea is to use as few as possible X-bits to keep the capture power under the peak power limit of the circuit under test (CUT), while using the remaining X-bits to reduce the shift power to cut down the CUT's average power consumption during scan tests as much as possible. In addition, by carefully selecting the X-filling order, our X-filling technique is able to achieve lower capture power when compared to existing methods. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.\n\n",

There are two orthogonal ways to improve performance: 1) scale-out by exploiting thread-level parallelism, and 2) scale-up by enabling core heterogeneity. Predicting the performance of such architecture is increasingly challenging. We propose a comprehensive performance model Amphisbaena, or \u03a6, built from two orthogonal functions \u03b1 and \u03b2. Function \u03b1 describes the scale-out speedup and function \u03b2 handles the scale-up speedup. The \u03a6 model can clearly tell not only the overall speedup of a given multithreading and core mapping strategy, but also how to improve the multithreading and core mapping, hence should be a promising performance predictor for future heterogenous many-cores. The results show that \u03a6 model's error rate is within 12%, which is lower than state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the application of \u03a6 model by introducing a heuristic scheduling algorithm, which outperforms the baselines by 13% on average.",

        "abstract": "Fault diagnosis plays an important role in physical failure analysis and yield learning process. With tens of billions of transistors being integrated in one chip, multiple faults may exist. With multiple faults, fault masking and reinforcing effects may appear. They may cause the conventional single-fault-based diagnosis methods such as the single location at a time (SLAT) to be invalid. The popular SLAT approach fails if there are not enough SLAT patterns that can be explained by a single stuck-at fault. Moreover, a real silicon defect may behave as different fault models (DM) under different failing patterns, which may invalidate the SLAT approach that uses a single-fault model across all failing patterns. In this paper, we introduce the concept of fault element to support multiple fault models, and use a fault-element graph (FEG) to consider fault masking and reinforcing effects among multiple faults. Based on the FEGs of all failing patterns, the most likely fault locations and their fault elements are iteratively identified. Meanwhile, the FEGs are iteratively pruned to keep track of the remaining multiple fault effects until all the fault locations are identified and all the FEGs are reduced to null. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed diagnosis method can identify the locations of multiple faults even under DM with high diagnostic accuracy and resolution.",

        "title": "A resilient on-chip router design through data path salvaging",
        "abstract": "Very large scale integrated circuits typically employ Network-on-Chip (NoC) as the backbone for on-chip communication. As technology advances into the nanometer regime, NoCs become more and more susceptible to permanent faults such as manufacturing defects, device wear-out, which hinder the correct operations of the entire system. Therefore, effective fault-tolerant techniques are essential to improve the reliability of NoCs. Prior work mainly focuses on introducing redundancies, which can't achieve satisfactory reliability and also involve large hardware overhead, especially for data path components. In this paper, we propose fine-grained data path salvaging techniques by splitting data path components, i.e., links, input buffers and crossbar into slices, instead of introducing redundancies. As long as there is one fault-free slice for each component, the router can be functional. Experimental results show that the proposed solution achieves quite high reliability with graceful performance degradation even under high fault rate.",

        "abstract": "Due to the recent progress in deep learning and neural acceleration architectures, specialized deep neural network or convolutional neural network (CNNs) accelerators are expected to provide an energy-efficient solution for real-time vision/speech processing. recognition and a wide spectrum of approximate computing applications. In addition to their wide applicability scope, we also found that the fascinating feature of deterministic performance and high energy-efficiency, makes such deep learning (DL) accelerators ideal candidates as application-processor IPs in embedded SoCs concerned with real-time processing. However, unlike traditional accelerator designs, DL accelerators introduce a new aspect of design trade-off between real-time processing (QoS) and computation approximation (QoR) into embedded systems. This work proposes an elastic CNN acceleration architecture that automatically adapts to the hard QoS constraint by exploiting the error-resilience in typical approximate computing workloads For the first time, the proposed design, including network tuning-and-mapping software and reconfigurable accelerator hardware, aims to reconcile the design constraint of QoS and Quality of Result (QoR). which are respectively the key concerns in real-time and approximate computing. It is shown in experiments that the proposed architecture enables the embedded system to work flexibly in an expanded operating space, significantly enhances its real-time ability. and maximizes the energy-efficiency of system within the user-specified QoS-QoR constraint through self-reconfiguration.",

        "abstract": "Cloud service providers use workload consolidation technique in many-core cloud processors to optimize system utilization and augment performance for ever extending scale-out workloads. Performance isolation usually has to be enforced for the consolidated workloads sharing the same many-core resources. Networks-on-chip (NoC) serves as a major shared resource, also needs to be isolated to avoid violating performance isolation. Prior work uses strict network isolation to fulfill performance isolation. However, strict network isolation either results in low consolidation density, or complex routing mechanisms which indicates prohibitive high hardware cost and large latency. In view of this limitation, we propose a novel NoC isolation strategy for many-core cloud processors, called relaxed isolation (RISO). It permits underutilized links to be shared by multiple applications, at the same time keeps the aggregated traffic in check to enforce performance isolation. The experimental results show that the consolidation density is improved more than 12% in comparison with previous strict isolation scheme, meanwhile reducing network latency by 38.4% on average.",

        "abstract": "Packet classification is important in fulfilling the requirements of new services such as policy-based routing in next generation networks. In this paper, we propose a novel bit vector based two-dimensional packet classification algorithm called Group Bit Vector. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is its ability to set the length of the bit vector to perform AND operation (the operation bit vector) regardless of the size of rule databases by effectively aggregating the rules and constructing particular groups of a limited number of members. Moreover, the proposed algorithm avoids the problem of false matches, which may be brought by rules aggregation. Thus, the length of the operation bit vector can be adjusted to be suitable to the width of memories to improve the performance. Experimental results demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

In our observation, proactively disabling the weakest components that limit the core frequency can still maintain a higher throughput at Near Threshold Voltage (NTV) supply if the cores with defected components are salvaged at a low cost. In this work, a resilience-aware frequency scaling and mapping strategy that considers defected processor states in scheduling is proposed to exploit the fault-tolerant architectures for higher energy efficiency. In our evaluation, it is witnessed that typical resilient multi-core processors can achieve significantly higher performance per watt in experiments compared to conventional scheduling policy.",

Because test vectors always try to activate as many faults as possible in the capture cycles, peak power during test usually happens in these cycles. X-filling is one effective way to reduce transitions happened in capture cycles to reduce peak power during test. However, its efficiency is limited and needs well exploration. This paper proposes an X Impact-Factor-Metric to estimate the impact of filling one X bit on other X bits in test cube. This metric is utilized to efficiently guide the X-filling to reduce the capture power. We call it Impact-Factor-Guided (IFG) X-filling. Experimental results on larger ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show that the average and maximum capture power can be reduced through our IFG X-filling by 65% and 31% on average, respectively. \u00a92007 IEEE.",

In this scenario, the network model is exposed to the risk of being attacked in the unverified devices if the parameters and hyper-parameters are transmitted and processed in an unencrypted way. Our work tackles this security problem by using on-chip memory Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and Processing-In-Memory (PIM). We allow the model execution only on authorized devices and protect the model from white-box attacks, black-box attacks and model tampering attacks. The proposed PUFs-and-PIM based Protection method for neural Models (P3M), can utilize unstable PUFs to protect the neural models in edge deep learning accelerators with negligible performance overhead. The experimental results show considerable performance improvement over two state-of-the-art solutions we evaluated.\n\n",

To resist attack, XOR arbiter PUF employs multiple basic arbiter PUFs and XOR their response bits to generate the final response bit. However, its low reliability not only limits its applications, but also leaks information to enhance modeling attacks. To improve both the reliability and the modeling attack resistance, we propose the Voter based PUF (VPUF), which also employs multiple basic arbiter PUFs. It has two key components: (1) an on-line reliability checker to evaluate the reliability level of each internal response bit produced by each basic arbiter PUF; (2) a weighted voter, instead of XOR gates, to produce the final response bit. Experiments in FPGAs show 7.6%\u223c23.4% reliability improvement of the VPUF than the XOR arbiter PUF, and prove the VPUF can resist modeling attacks.",

Timing channel attack is one of the most remarkable security threads for memory controllers due to competition for shared resources.

In this paper, we propose a light-weight PIM architecture, approxPIM, which leverages approximate computing techniques to enable InMemory Processing in a realistic 3D-stacked DRAM, Micronu0027s Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC). Using the newly-released atomic instruction support of the HMC, approxPIM can process a wide range of data-intensive applications without adding any logic resources into the memory devices. Furthermore, we propose to approximate those accuracy-insensitive applications with the limited functioning set of HMC commands so that they could be smoothly mapped to the HMCs without the inference from processors, therefore enabling energy-efficient Processing-in-Memory and greatly expanding the scope of target PIM applications with HMC. In general, approxPIM gives a comprehensive study on HMCu0027s potential and weakness in the application of Processing-in-Memory. Evaluation results show that our approxPIM significantly boosts the energy-efficiency and performance of the whole system.",

To support a more efficient design tradeoff, we present a new fault model, Stability Violation, derived from analysis of signal behavior. Furthermore, we propose a unified fault detection scheme---Stability Violation based Fault Detection (SVFD), by which the soft errors (both Single Event Upset and Single Event Transient), aging delay, and delay faults can be uniformly handled. SVFD can greatly facilitate soft error-resistant and aging-aware designs. SVFD is validated by conducting a set of intensive Hspice simulations targeting 65nm CMOS technology. Experimental results show that SVFD has more robust capability for fault detection than previous schemes at comparable overhead in terms of area, power, and performance.",

        "abstract": "Leakage current of CMOS circuit increases dramatically with the technology scaling down and has become a critical issue of high performance system. Subthreshold, gate and reverse biased junction band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) leakages are considered three main determinants of total leakage current. Up to now, how to accurately estimate leakage current of large-scale circuits within endurable time remains unsolved, even though accurate leakage models have been widely discussed. In this paper, the authors first dip into the stack effect of CMOS technology and propose a new simple gate-level leakage current model. Then, a table-lookup based total leakage current simulator is built up according to the model. To validate the simulator, accurate leakage current is simulated at circuit level using popular simulator HSPICE for comparison. Some further studies such as maximum leakage current estimation, minimum leakage current generation and a high-level average leakage current macromodel are introduced in detail. Experiments on ISCAS85 and ISCAS89 benchmarks demonstrate that the two proposed leakage current estimation methods are very accurate and efficient.",

The optimized DFT features are presented in detail. A hybrid scan compression structure was executed and achieved compression ratio more than ten times. Memory built-in self-test (BIST) circuitries were designed with scan collars instead of bitmaps to reduce area overheads and to improve test and debug efficiency. The implemented DFT framework also utilized internal phase-locked loops (PLL) to provide complex at-speed test clock sequences. Since there are still limitations in this DFT design, the test strategies for this case are quite complex, with complicated automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) and debugging flow. The sample testing results are given in the paper. All the DFT methods discussed in the paper are prototypes for a high-volume manufacturing (HVM) DFT plan to meet high quality test goals as well as slow test power consumption and cost.",

The reason lies in that the circuit structure information is lost in the conversion to CNF. To overcome this drawback in SAT-based unbounded model checking, an improved SAT solver is proposed. First, the concept of define-value clauses is given to store the circuit structure in CNF. The improved solver avoids many redundant decisions which would be made by previous solvers. And then, A CNF-based assignment reduction algorithm is employed to speedup the convergence in search. The experimental result shows that the improved solver achieves obvious speedup over a previous method in preimage computation. The new method is capable of handling complex circuit property checking on which BDD-based methods would hardly work.",

Although plenty ofprior work discussed how to perform scan chain diagnosis, most of the previously proposed techniques made an assumption that the system logic is fault-free, which could be an impractical assumption leading to incorrect diagnostic results. In this paper, we propose a scan chain Deterministic Diagnostic Pattern Generation (DDPG) method that can tolerate the faults in the system logic without degradation of chain diagnostic resolution and precision. The entire flow includes three steps. In the first step, patterns are created to propagate the state of a targeted scan cell to as many reliable observation points as possible. In the second step, the load error probability of each targeted scan cell is calculated based on the Hamming Distances between the observed responses and the expected good or faulty responses. In the last step, a suspect profile is plotted, which can be used to identify the suspect scan cell(s) based on ranking scores. Experimental results show that the diagnostic resolution andprecision are not degraded even with dozens offaults injected into the system logic. \u00a9 2008 IEEE.",

However, an observation shows that compared to NoC-reuse TAM, some bus-based TAM are able to achieve better results in test time due to its fine-grained scheduling unit. This paper proposed a new TAM named Test Tree(T2). T2TAM could be built by reusing the hardware resources of routers instead of reusing the packet-based NoC. Though implementing DFT design on routers, the T2TAM can achieve wire utilization and adopts fine-grained basic scheduling. Besides, to address the problem of testing large number of homogeneous cores, T2-TAM is proposed to facilitate multicasting stimuli to homogeneous cores to save test time. Experimental results show that the test cycles could be reduced up to 38% in comparison with the work reusing NoC as TAM with only 0.3% DFT overhead.",

Due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of on-chip traffic, existing power management approaches cannot adapt the NoC power consumption to its traffic intensity, and hence lead to a suboptimal power efficiency. They either resort to over-provisioned NoC design that only suits for traffic spatial distribution, or coarse-grained power gating that only serves traffic temporal variation. In this paper, we propose a novel NoC architecture called Shuttle Networks-on-Chip (ShuttleNoC). By permitting packets shuttling between multiple subnetworks, localized power adaptation can be achieved. Experimental results show that ShuttleNoC could achieve optimal power efficiency with up to 23.5% power savings and 22.3% performance boost in comparison with traditional heterogeneity-agnostic NoC designs.",

        "abstract": "The limited write endurance of phase change random access memory (PRAM) is one of the major obstacles for PRAM-based main memory. Wear leveling techniques were proposed to extend its lifetime by balancing writes traffic. Another important concern that need to be considered is endurance variation in PRAM chips. When different PRAM cells have distinct endurance, balanced writes will result in lifetime degradation due to the weakest cells. Instead of balancing writes traffic, in this paper we propose wear rate leveling (WRL), a variant of wear leveling, to balance wear rates (i.e., writes traffic/edudrance) of cells across the PRAM chip. After investigating writing behavior of applications and endurance variation, we propose an architecture-level WRL mechanism. Moreover, there is an important tradeoff between endurance improvement and swapping data volume. To co-optimize endurance and swapping, a novel algorithm, Max Hyper-weight Rematching, is proposed to maximize PRAM lifetime and minimize performance degradation. Experimental results show 19x endurance improvement to prior Wear Leveling.",

        "abstract": "Topology virtualization techniques are proposed for NoC-based many-core processors with core-level redundancy to isolate hardware changes caused by on-chip defective cores. Prior work focuses on homogeneous cores with symmetric performance and optimizes on-chip communication only. However, core-to-core performance asymmetry due to manufacturing process variations poses new challenges for constructing virtual topologies. Lower performance cores may scatter over a virtual topology, while operating systems typically allocate tasks to continuous cores. As a result, parallel applications are probably assigned to a region containing many slower cores that become bottlenecks. To tackle the above problem, in this paper we present a novel performance-asymmetry-aware reconfiguration algorithm Bubble-Up based on a new metric called core fragmentation factor (CFF). Bubble-Up can arrange cores with similar performance closer, yet maintaining reasonable hop distances between virtual neighbors, thus accelerating applications with higher degree of parallelism, without changing existing allocation strategies for OS. Experimental results show its effectiveness.",

Techniques that capture post-silicon variation by deploying on-chip monitors suffer from serious area overhead and low testing reliability, while techniques using non-invasion test are limited in small scale circuits. In this paper, a novel layout-aware post-silicon variation extraction method which is based on non-invasive path-delay test is proposed. The key technique of the proposed method is a novel layout-aware heuristic path selection algorithm which takes the spatial correlation and linear dependence between paths into consideration. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can obtain an accurate timing variation distribution with zero area overhead. Moreover, the test cost is much smaller than the existing non-invasion method.",

The branches executed but not observed by a test sequence are identified as our target branches. The test generation for each target branch is converted to the process of covering multiple intermediate sub-target states sequentially to guarantee the execution and observation of the target branch. Valid input vectors are automatically generated by multicycle path constraint solving and simulation is guided by the abstract distance information to reach the sub-target states.

        "abstract": "Geographic routing is attractive in wireless sensor networks due to its efficiency and scalability. Previously proposed geographic routing protocols commonly employ a maximum-distance greedy forwarding technique. However, recent experiments also have shown that wireless link can be extremely unreliable. Simple greedy forwarding will cause high packet drop rate in realistic link environment. Scarce sensor energy is dissipated, and the lifetime of the network is shortened. Therefore, improve the energy efficiency and load balance to prolong the network lifetime has become the important design considerations for sensor network geographic routing in lossy wireless link. In this paper, we propose LEGR protocol, which use energy aware metrics together with geographical information and packets reception rate to make routing decisions. A novel link estimator and real time energy estimation scheme is designed in the sub layer of the LEGR protocol to get the neighbour nodes ' PRR value and current energy level. To evaluate the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed protocol, we define several performance metrics. In terms of theses metrics, our comprehensive simulation results show that, compared with PRR*distance forwarding scheme, LEGR extend the lifetime of the sensor network about 20% with approximate delivery rate and energy efficiency. Compared with GEAR and GPSR, LEGR performs better in terms of almost all the performance metrics. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Unlike conventional ICs, approximate computing chips are less sensitive to hardware errors. This fascinating feature can be utilized to improve the performance of chip design and even change the timing closure procedure of digital circuit design flow. In this paper, we study the potential of resilience-aware circuit clocking scheme, and demonstrate the methodology with advanced neural network (NN)-based accelerator. We propose a novel timing analysis and frequency setting method for NN-based approximate computing circuits based on in-field NN retraining. With the proposed iterative retiming-and-retraining framework, NN-based accelerator can be retrained to operate safely at aggressive operating frequencies compared with the frequency decided purely by statistical timing analysis or Monto Carlo analysis. For nanometer process technology with increasing threats of timing errors induced by process variation, noises, and so on, our retiming-and-retraining method enables higher circuit operating frequency and enables dynamic precision/frequency adjustment for approximate computing circuits. We evaluate the methodology with both the neural and deep learning accelerators in experiments. The experimental results show that timing errors in neural circuits can be effectively tamed for different applications, so that the circuits can operate at higher clocking rates under the specified quality constraint or be dynamically scaled to work at a wide range of frequency states with only minor accuracy losses.",

Corresponding three general evaluation methods to evaluate the energy efficiency of the cluster-based routing protocols such as LEACH, PEGASIS, and BCDCP are provided. Moreover, three facts are found in them: (1) High-level software energy macro model is used to compute the energy dissipation of general data fusion software and make the constant value of energy dissipation of 1-bit data fusion an especial instance. (2) Multi-hop energy efficiency is related to the radio hardware parameters and the dynamic topology of network and the above protocols do not exploit the best use of the energy efficiency of multi-hop scheme. (3) High-energy dissipation non-cluster-head nodes, whose number changes with the density of the sensor nodes in clusters, worsen the death of nodes. The numerical results of experiments reprove these discoveries. Furthermore, they provide helpful guide for improving the above routing protocols to extent their application ranges. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.",

But a drawback of these methods is that the unspecified bits are filled with random values resulting in a great deal of transitions during scan-in thereby causing high power dissipation. In this paper, we present a new deterministic pattern generation structure that can be used in conjunction with LFSR reseeding scheme. The proposed scheme utilizes scan slices overlapping of test patterns to reduce the number of specified bits and the number of transitions at the same time. As a result, the scheme can significantly reduce test power and even further reduce test storage. A decoder is used to generate control signals. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly reduces the switching activity by 80 % and only needs a relatively small test data storage(25% of original Mintest test sets).",

Effective defect tolerance techniques are essential to improve the yield of such complex integrated circuits. We propose to achieve fault tolerance by employing redundancy at the core-level instead of at the microarchitecture level. When faulty cores exist on-chip in this architecture, however, the physical topologies of various manufactured chips can be significantly different. How to reconfigure the system with the most effective NoC topology is a relevant research problem. In this paper, we first show that this problem is an instance of a well known NP-complete problem. We then present novel solutions for the above problem, which not only maximize the performance of the on-chip communication scheme, but also provide a unified topology to Operating System and application software running on the processor. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.",

But it suffers from both crosstalk and SEU errors, which affect its proper function. Therefore, it is desirable to design a reliable NOC under acceptable overhead. In this paper, an SCAC-TMR scheme is provided for NOC design, which maps data into selected crosstalk avoidance code (SCAC) for message transmission and preserves state and controlling registers of routers with triple modular redundancy (TMR). This scheme can avoid large crosstalk-induced delay in GHz circuits, because SCAC forbids relevant signal transitions on channels. Besides, due to low power dissipation of SCAC, routers of this scheme consume lower power. Experimental result shows that this scheme can save nearly 18% area overhead and 31% power dissipation compared with former method.",

        "abstract": "Approximate computing, which trades off computation quality (e.g, accuracy) and computation efforts, has becoming a promising technique to improve performance for many mission-non-critical and error-tolerant applications. The computations in such applications usually exhibit superior value locality, i.e, computations performed by a function or code region are very likely to reproduce \u201csimilar\u201d results. Reusing the similar results can bypass redundant computations, as long as \u201cexact\u201d results are not mandatory. However, conventional computation reuse techniques are less effective in approximate computing paradigm. The input values of two computation instances have to be identical to reuse one for another, hence \u201cexact\u201d in nature.We propose ACR, an approximate computation reuse framework, to enable computation reuse for approximate computing. ACR relaxes the exact matching requirement in inputs to some extent regulated by \u201csimilarity\u201d quantification, thereby shifting the exact computation reuse paradigm to its approximate counterpart. We furthermore propose an input significance-aware similarity quantification scheme through statistical approaches. Experimental result shows ACR could effectively exploit the potential of computation reuse for approximate computing and reduce 47.6% computations on average for a set of approximate applications.",

Core-level fault-tolerant approaches bind two cores to implement redundant execution and error detection. However, along with more cores integrated into one chip, existing static and dynamic binding schemes suffer from the scalability problem when considering the violation effects caused by external write operations. In this paper, we present a transparent dynamic binding (TDB) mechanism to address the issue. Learning from static binding schemes, we involve the private caches to hold identical data blocks, thus we reduce the global masters-lave consistency maintenance to the scale of the private caches. With our fault-tolerant cache coherence protocol, TDB satisfies the objective of private cache consistency, therefore provides excellent scalability and flexibility. Experimental results show that, for a set of parallel workloads, the overall performance of our TDB scheme is very close to that of baseline fault-tolerant systems, outperforming dynamic core coupling by 9.2%, 10.4%, 18% and 37.1% when considering 4, 8, 16 and 32 cores respectively.",

        "abstract": "In ultra-deep submicrometer technology, soft errors and device aging are two of the paramount reliability concerns. Although many studies have been done to tackle the two challenges, most take them separately so far, thereby failing to reach better performance-cost tradeoffs. To support a more efficient design tradeoff, we propose a unified fault detection scheme - stability violation-based fault detection (SVFD), by which the soft errors (both single event upset and single event transient), aging delay, and delay faults can be uniformly dealt with. SVFD grounds on a new fault model, stability violation, derived from analysis of signal behavior. SVFD has been validated by conducting a set of intensive Hspice simulations targeting the next-generation 32-nm CMOS technology. An application of SVFD to a floating-point unit (FPU) is also evaluated. Experimental results show that SVFD has more versatile fault detection capability for fault detection than several schemes recently proposed at comparable overhead in terms of area, power, and performance.",

However, typical deep learning models like deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) consume so much on-chip storage and high-throughput compute resources that they cannot be easily handled by mobile or embedded devices with thrifty silicon and power budget. In order to enable large CNN models in mobile or more cutting-edge devices for IoT or cyberphysics applications, we proposed an efficient on-chip memory architecture for CNN inference acceleration, and showed its application to our in-house general-purpose deep learning accelerator. The redesigned on-chip memory subsystem, Memsqueezer, includes an active weight buffer set and data buffer set that embrace specialized compression methods to reduce the footprint of CNN weight and data set respectively. The Memsqueezer buffer can compress the data and weight set according to their distinct features, and it also includes a built-in redundancy detection mechanism that actively scans through the work-set of CNNs to boost their inference performance by eliminating the data redundancy. In our experiment, it is shown that the CNN accelerators with Memsqueezer buffers achieves more than 2x performance improvement and reduces 80% energy consumption on average over the conventional buffer design with the same area budget.",

In this paper, a novel hardware Trojan (HT) detection method based on the property coverage analysis is proposed to verify the synthesized netlist. The proposed method is motivated by the observation that the malicious modification on the design would threaten the predesigned properties, either by invalidating the properties or by lowering their state coverage, which can be verified by model checking in principle. The proposed method has generality and can be applied to a variety of hardware Trojans.

Compared to 2D convolutions that share the filters in 2D spatial domain, 3D convolutions further reuse filters in the temporal dimension to capture time-domain features. Prior works on specialized 3D-CNN accelerators employ additional on-chip memories and multi-cluster architecture to reuse data among the process element (PE) arrays, which is too expensive for low-power chips. Instead of harvesting in-memory locality, we propose a 3D systolic cube architecture to exploit the spatial-and-temporal localities of 3D CNNs, which moves the reusable data in-between PEs connected via a 3D-cube Network-on-Chip. Evaluation shows that systolic-cube contributes to considerable energy-efficiency boost for activity-recognition benchmarks.\n\n",

        "abstract": "As CMOS technology scales into the nanometer era, future shipped microprocessors will be increasingly vulnerable to intermittent faults. Quantitatively characterizing the vulnerability of microprocessor structures to intermittent faults at an early design stage is significantly helpful in balancing system reliability and performance. Prior researches have proposed several metrics to analyze the vulnerability of microprocessor structures to soft errors and hard faults, however, the vulnerability of these structures to intermittent faults is rarely considered yet. In this work, we propose a metric intermittent vulnerability factor (IVF) to characterize the vulnerability of microprocessor structures to intermittent faults. A structure's IVF is the probability an intermittent fault in that structure causes an external visible error (failure). We compute IVFs for reorder buffer and register file considering three intermittent fault models: intermittent stuck-at-1 and stuck-at-0 fault model, intermittent open and short fault model, and intermittent timing fault model. Experimental results show that, among the three types of intermittent faults, intermittent stuck-at-1 faults have the most serious impact on program execution. Besides, IVF varies significantly across individual structures and programs, which implies partial protection to the most vulnerable structures and program phases for minimizing performance and/or energy overheads.",

        "abstract": "Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have broad application prospects in the field of hardware security. Like faults in general-purpose circuits, faults may also occur in PUFs. Fault diagnosis plays an important role in the yield learning process. Traditional fault diagnosis methods are based on comparing the fault-free responses of a design and the failing responses of chips. However, different manufactured, fault-free PUFs with the same design have different challenge-response pairs, so PUFs do not have deterministic, fault-free responses. Hence, traditional fault diagnosis methods are unsuitable for PUFs. To effectively diagnose PUFs, this paper proposes a diagnostic challenge generation method for the typical PUF: arbiter PUF. The diagnostic challenges that can deterministically or probabilistically distinguish the suspect faults of arbiter PUFs are generated. Simulation experiments on diagnosing failing arbiter PUF instances show that all the actual fault locations are accurately included in the candidate sets, and the average number of candidate locations (i.e., diagnostic resolution) is 1.585. FPGA experiments on diagnosing real PUFs show that the diagnostic accuracy is also 1, and the average diagnostic resolution is 1.602.",

        "abstract": "Hardware Trojans (HTs) are emerging threats for integrated circuits. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, named LMDet, to detect HTs through distinguishing the \u201cunnaturalness\u201d of HTs from the \u201cnaturalness\u201d of normal circuits using the natural language processing technology. The key insight of LMDet is that we find clean circuits tend to be \u201cnatural\u201d (i.e., to be highly repetitive in structure) and HTs appear to be \u201cunnatural\u201d (i.e., to be rare in structure) in some sense. LMDet models circuit gates sequentially, using the    $n$   -gram language model. Gate sequences from the circuit under detection (CUD) are assessed according to their probability in the model, and low-probability sequences are marked as suspected Trojan-related gates. Evaluation with benchmarks and industrial circuits shows that LMDet is capable of detecting Trojan logic without the HT-free reference of CUD. LMDet has short execution time on large commercial circuits with acceptable space overhead. It is a promising method in real industry since plenty of HT-free designs are available as training corpus to ensure good statistical effects.",

        "abstract": "Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) variations can significantly degrade the performance benefits expected from next nanoscale technology. The primary circuit implication of the PVT variations is the resultant timing emergencies. In a multi-core processor running multiple programs, variations create spatial and temporal unbalance across the processing cores. Most prior schemes are dedicated to tolerating PVT variations individually for a single core, but ignore the opportunity of leveraging the complementary effects between variations and the intrinsic variation unbalance among individual cores. We find that the notorious delay impacts from different variations are not necessary aggregated. Cores with mild variations can share the violent workload from cores suffering large variations. If operated correctly, variations on different cores can help mitigating each other and result in a variation-mild environment. In this paper, we propose Timing Emergency Aware Thread Migration (TEA-TM), a delay sensor-based scheme to reduce system timing emergencies under PVT variations. Fourier transform and frequency domain analysis are conducted to provide the insights and the potential of the PVT co-optimization scheme. Experimental results show on average TEA-TM can help save up to 24% throughput loss, at the same time improve the system fairness by 85%.",

        "abstract": "Inference efficiency is the predominant consideration in designing deep learning accelerators. Previous work mainly focuses on skipping zero values to deal with remarkable ineffectual computation, while zero bits in non-zero values, as another major source of ineffectual computation, is often ignored. The reason lies on the difficulty of extracting essential bits during operating multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) in the processing element. Based on the fact that zero bits occupy as high as 68.9% fraction in the overall weights of modern deep convolutional neural network models, this paper firstly proposes a weight kneading technique that could eliminate ineffectual computation caused by either zero value weights or zero bits in non-zero weights, simultaneously. Besides, a split-and-accumulate (SAC) computing pattern in replacement of conventional MAC, as well as the corresponding hardware accelerator design called Tetris are proposed to support weight kneading at the hardware level. Experimental results prove that Tetris could speed up inference up to 1.50x, and improve power efficiency up to 5.33x compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "Similar to other cyber infrastructure systems, as wireless sensor networks become larger and more complex, many classic algorithms may no longer work efficiently. This paper presents a wireless sensor network time synchronization model that was initially inspired by synchronous flashing of fireflies. Synchronous flashing of fireflies is an interesting phenomenon that has been studied for decades. A variety of models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, among which is the pulse-coupled oscillators model that models fireflies as oscillators. The oscillators in such a model interact only through discrete pulses, similar to the flashing of fireflies. In this paper, we propose a new nonidentical linear pulse-coupled oscillators model and use the model to analyze synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators with different frequencies. The conditions to achieve and maintain synchronization are derived, and then, the results are used to prove that the oscillators in the model can achieve synchronization eventually, except for a set of frequencies with zero Lebesgue measure. Furthermore, through simulations and implementation on a wireless sensor network testbed, we demonstrate that the proposed nonidentical linear pulse-coupled oscillators model can be used in designing lightweight scalable time synchronization protocols for distributed systems. \u00a9 2009 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) accelerators have been proposed as an efficient hardware solution for deep learning based applications, which are known to be both compute-and-memory intensive. Although the most advanced CNN accelerators can deliver high computational throughput, the performance is highly unstable. Once changed to accommodate a new network with different parameters like layers and kernel size, the fixed hardware structure, may no longer well match the data flows. Consequently, the accelerator will fail to deliver high performance due to the underutilization of either logic resource or memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we proposed a novel deep learning accelerator, which offers multiple types of data-level parallelism: inter-kernel, intra-kernel and hybrid. Our design can adaptively switch among the three types of parallelism and the corresponding data tiling schemes to dynamically match different networks or even different layers of a single network. No matter how we change the hardware configurations or network types, the proposed network mapping strategy ensures the optimal performance and energy-efficiency. Compared with previous state-of-the-art NN accelerators, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 4.0x-8.3x for some layers of the well-known large scale CNNs. For the whole phase of network forward-propagation, our design achieves 28.04% PE energy saving, 90.3% on-chip memory energy saving on average.",

A parament challenge comes from a variety of aging mechanisms that can cause gradual performance degradation of circuits. Prior work shows that such progressive degradation can be reliably detected by dedicated aging sensors, which provides a good foundation for proposing a new scheme to improve lifetime reliability. In this paper, we propose ReviveNet, a hardware-implemented aging-aware and self-adaptive architecture. Aging awareness is realized by deploying dedicated aging sensors, and self-adaptation is achieved by employing a group of synergistic agents. Each agent implements a localized timing adaptation mechanism to tolerate aging-induced delay on critical paths. On the evaluation, a reliability model based on widely used weibull distribution is presented. Experimental results show that, without compromising with any nominal architectural performance, ReviveNet can improve the Mean-Time-To-Failure by up to 48.7 percent, at the expense of 9.5 percent area overhead and small power increase.",

BCDCP improves LEACH by introducing a minimal spanning tree (MST) to connect CHs and adopting iterative cluster splitting algorithm to choose CHs or form clusters. This paper proposes another innovative cluster-based routing protocol named dynamic minimal spanning tree routing protocol (DMSTRP), which improves BCDCP by introducing MSTs instead of clubs to connect nodes in clusters. Simulation results show that DMSTRP excels LEACH and BCDCP in terms of both network lifetime and delay when the network size becomes large",

        "abstract": "Digital ecosystems (DEs) are based on a large amount of distributed data, and these data are gathered from physical devices, particularly from wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Due to the inherent stringent bandwidth and energy constraints, energy-efficient mechanisms of performance measurement are the key to the proper operation of WSNs and thereby important for the data reliability of DEs. This paper presents a novel algorithm, i.e., Loss Inference based on Passive Measurement (LIPM), to infer WSN link loss performance. The LIPM algorithm passively monitors the application traffic between sensor nodes and the sink (base station), and then uses network tomography technology to infer the network internal performance. Furthermore, contour maps, the well-known representation of data, are first taken into account in WSN loss performance inference, which can help the LIPM algorithm identify lossy areas rapidly. Finally, the algorithm is validated through simulations and exhibits good performance and scalability.",

Owing to including gross delay fault (GDF) coverage, prior metrics cannot concentrate on the detection of SDFs. We propose a new metric, statistical SDF Coverage (S-SDFC), for differentiating SDFs and GDFs and evaluating the test quality of SDFs under the statistical delay quality model. Experimental results show that S-SDFC is more conservative and effective in evaluating the quality of test sets in detecting SDFs and outperforms other metrics in guiding test generation.",

        "abstract": "As the feature size of FPGA shrinks to nanometers, SRAM-based FPGAs are more vulnerable to soft errors. During logic synthesis, reliability of the design can be improved by introducing logic masking effect. In this work, we observe that there are a lot of not-fully occupied look-up tables (LUTs) after logic synthesis. Hence, we propose a functional equivalent class based soft error mitigation scheme to exploit free LUT entries in the circuit. The proposed technique replaces not fully-occupied LUTs with corresponding functional equivalent classes, which can improve the reliability while preserve the functionality of the design. Experimental results show that, compared with the baseline ABC mapper, the proposed technique can reduce the soft error rate by 21%, and the critical-path delay increase is only 4.25%.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a scan-based delay test method, called sequential-broad-side (SeBoS), to minimize overtesting of delay test. We consider two critical reasons for overtesting which are the existence of illegal states in sequential circuits and the high IR drop caused by power dissipation during structural test. The proposed SeBoS method inserts several slow clock cycles before applying the fast clock for detecting delay faults, thus considerable illegal states can be avoided and IR drop can be reduced. Illegal states are not necessarily computed before test generation. They can be accumulated and expanded during the automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) process. The derived illegal states are then used to guide test generation for the remaining faults. Compared with previous methods, the SeBoS method can avoid more illegal states when considering the same number of time frames. Experimental results on ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits show the effectiveness of the method.",

        "abstract": "Time synchronization is a critical middleware service of wireless sensor networks. Re- searchers have already proposed some time synchronization algorithms. However, due to the de- mands for various synchronization precision, existing time synchronization algorithms often need to be adapted. So it is necessary to evaluate these adapted algorithms before use. Software simulation is a valid and quick way to do it. In this paper, we present a time synchronization simulator, Simsync, for wireless sensor networks. We decompose the packet delay into 6 delay components and model them separately. The frequency of crystal oscillator is modeled as Gaussian. To testify its effec- tiveness, we simulate the reference broadcast synchronization algorithm (RBS) and the timing-sync synchronization algorithm (TPSN) on Simsync. Simulated results are also presented and analyzed.",

        "abstract": "Despite the increasing popularity of the smart home concept, such a technology is vulnerable to various security threats such as pricing cyberattacks. There are some technical advances in developing detection and defense frameworks against those pricing cyberattacks. However, none of them considers the impact of net metering, which allows the customers to sell the excessively generated renewable energy back to the grid. At a superficial glance, net metering seems to be irrelevant to the cybersecurity, while this paper demonstrates that its implication is actually profound. In this paper, we propose to analyze the impact of the net metering technology on the smart home pricing cyberattack detection. Net metering changes the grid energy demand, which is considered by the utility when designing the guideline price. Thus, cyberattack detection is compromised if this impact is not considered. It motivates us to develop a new smart home pricing cyberattack detection framework which judiciously integrates the net metering technology with the short/long term detection. The simulation results demonstrate that our new framework can significantly improve the detection accuracy from 65.95% to 95.14% compared to the state-of-art detection technique.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of cloud services dictates increasingly powerful datacenters to maintain the high quality of service (QoS). It's a common practice in virtually all tiers of datacenters to continuously upgrade the datacenters, i.e. replacing outdated and failed servers with more advanced and efficient ones. However, how to upgrade a datacenter in the most cost-efficient strategy remains unclear, and however this problem goes increasingly challenging given the great diversity of applications. In practice, the datacenters\u2019 operators usually resort to expending the scale of servers. The preferred servers are either expensive but high-performance, or, by contrast, cheap but low-power. Whatever sever preferences, how to justify the cost-efficiency is still an open problem. We claim that a cost-efficient upgrading strategy should be fully aware of not only the capacity and cost of various servers, but also the resource demands of target applications. We model this strategy as a recommendation problem: recommending the \u201cbest\u201d servers to a datacenter. We propose \u201cEcoUp\u201d, a model-based framework that faithfully rates the cost efficiency of server candidates, relying on which an optimal server portfolio can be derived. The performance prediction on candidate servers is realized by employing a sophisticated latent factor model (LFM). The cost mainly involves the server purchasing cost and energy bill. Given the application distribution, EcoUp can give an optimal server portfolio under a certain capital budget. We use Google trace, a big profiling dataset opened by Google, to validate the performance prediction. Experimental results show that the error rate is below 8 percent on average. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive upgrading procedure on a local cluster to evaluate the potential of EcoUp. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms two conventional upgrading strategies by 12.3 and 33.6 percent in terms of system throughput, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Fault-tolerant routing is usually used to provide reliable on-chip communication for many-core processors. This paper focuses on a special class of algorithms that do not use virtual channels. One of the major challenges is to keep the network deadlock free in the presence of faults, especially those locating on network edges. State-of-the-art solutions address this problem by either disabling all nodes of the faulty network edges or including all faults into one faulty block. Therefore, a large number of fault-free nodes will be sacrificed. To address this problem, the proposed ZoneDefense routing not only includes faults into convex faulty blocks but also spreads the faulty blocks' position information in corresponding columns. The nodes, which know the position of faulty blocks, form the defense zones. Therefore, packets can find the faulty blocks and route around them in advance. Exploiting the defense zones, the proposed ZoneDefense routing could tolerate many more faults with significantly reduced sacrificed fault-free nodes compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the ZoneDefense routing does not degrade the network performance in the absence of faults, and could get similar performance as its counterparts in the presence of faults.",

        "abstract": "Semiconductor technology continues advancing,while global on-chip interconnects do not scale with the same pace as transistors,which has become the major bottleneck for performance and integration of future giga-scale ICs.Threedimensional(3D) integration has been proposed to sustain Moore's law by incorporating through-silicon vias(TSVs) to integrate different circuit modules in the vertical direction,which is believed to be one of the most promising techniques to tackle the interconnect scaling problem.Due to its unique characteristics,there are many research opportunities,and in this paper we focus on the test wrapper optimization for the individual circuit-partitioned embedded cores within 3D System-onChips(SoCs).Firstly,we use existing 2D SoCs algorithms to minimize test time for individual embedded cores.In addition,vertical interconnects,i.e.,TSVs that are used to construct the test wrapper should be taken into consideration as well.This is because TSVs typically employ bonding pads to tackle the misalignment problem,and they will occupy significant planar chip area,which may result in routing congestion.In this paper,we propose a series of heuristic algorithms to reduce the number of TSVs used in test wrapper chain construction without affecting test time negatively.It is composed of two steps,i.e.,scan chain allocation and functional input/output insertion,both of which can reduce TSV count significantly.Through extensive experimental evaluations,it is shown that the test wrapper chain structure designed by our method can reduce the number of test TSVs dramatically,i.e.,as much as 60.5% reductions in comparison with the random method and 26% in comparison with the intuitive method.",

The method is simulation-based. Firstly, it abstracts RTL behavioral descriptions to Process Controlling Trees (PCT)and Data Dependency Graphs (DDG), which are used for behavioral simulation and data tracing. Transfer faults are extracted from DDG edges, which compose a fault set needed for test generation. Then, simulation begins without specifying inputs in advance, and a request-echo strategy is used to fix some uncertain inputs if necessary. Finally, when the simulation ends, the partially fixed input sequence is the generated test sequence. The proposed request-echo strategy greatly reduces unnecessary backtracking, and always tries to cover uncovered transfer faults. Therefore, the proposed method is very efficient, and generates tests with good quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is better than ARTIST in three aspects: (1) the CPU time is shorter by three orders of magnitude; (2) the test length is shorter by 52%; and (3) the fault coverage is higher by 0.89%.",

        "abstract": "The Network-on-Chip (NoC) meshes are limited by the reliability constraint, which impels us to exploit the fault tolerant routing. Particularly, one of the main design issues is minimizing the loss of non-faulty routers at the presence of faults. To address that problem, we propose a new fault tolerant routing, which has the following two distinct advantages: First, it keeps a network deadlock-free by utilizing restricted intermediate nodes rather than adding virtual channels (VC). This characteristic leads to an area-efficient router. Second, in the proposed routing algorithm, the rounds of DOR are not limited by the number of VC's anymore. As a consequence, the number of sacrificed non-faulty routers is significantly reduced. We demonstrate above advantages through extensive simulations. The experimental results show that under the limitation of VC's, the proposed routing algorithm always sacrifices the minimal number of non-faulty routers compared to previous solutions.",

        "abstract": "The continuous shrinking of the feature size in CMOS technology has significantly increased the power densities of integrated circuits, leading to severe temperature issues. However, the previous offline simulation-based thermal optimization works cast large deviations with the reality, while online sensing-based thermal managements usually incur significant performance overhead. Therefore, it is crucial to propose a method that could achieve fine-grained optimization with accurate temperature profiles. In this paper, we propose a timing-constraint temperature sensing-based hotspot-driven placement technique for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The hotspot optimization issue is modeled as a hyper minimum bipartite matching problem and is solved by a place adjustment with the input of an online sensed temperature profile. We propose an open-source/commercial hybrid design flow to implement the whole optimization in Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in peak temperature and a great improvement on thermal uniformity, with slight performance overhead under timing constraints.",

        "abstract": "Recently, selective encoding of scan slices is proposed to compress test data. This encoding technique, unlike many other compression techniques encoding all the bits, only encodes the target-symbol by specifying single bit index and copying group data. In this paper, we propose an extended selective encoding which presents two new techniques: flexible grouping strategy, X bits exploitation and filling strategy. Flexible grouping strategy is able to decrease the number of encoded groups to improve compression ratio. X bits exploitation and filling strategy can exploit a large number of don't care bits to reduce testing power with no compression ratio loss. Experimental results show that the proposed technique needs less test data storage volume and reduces average weighted switching activity by 24.7%, peak weighted switching activity by 11.6% during scan shift compared to selective encoding.",

In this paper, a new bus encoding method based on codeword selection is presented for enduring crosstalk-induced effects, which can avoid crosstalk and provide error correction as well. This method finds a subset from crosstalk avoidance code (CAC) to provide error correction. It can avoid crosstalk induced by late signal transition on checking bits in the previous methods. Extra wires for checking bus are never required in the proposed method. Experiment shows that the method reduces 6% wire overhead compared to the former methods.

Input vector control is an efficient method to reduce leakage current when a circuit operating in standby mode and can be widely used because of its easy implementation and little influence on the original circuit. Fast simulators are urgently needed to generate minimum leakage pattern (MLP), which can be applied to the circuit to suppress the leakage current. Precise circuit simulators (such as HSPICE) can accurately account for leakage power estimation, but are only practical for small circuits. In this paper, a new gate-level leakage power model is introduced considering stack effect to generate MLP. Experiments show MLP method is efficient and applicable for the designs of low leakage and high performance circuits with low timing and area overhead.",

        "abstract": "The load power range of modern processors is greatly enlarged because many advanced power management techniques are employed, such as dynamic voltage frequency scaling, Turbo Boosting, and near-threshold voltage (NTV) technologies. However, because the efficiency of power delivery varies greatly with different load conditions, conventional power delivery designs cannot maintain high efficiency over the entire voltage spectrum, and the gained power saving may be offset by power loss in power delivery. We propose SuperRange, a wide operational range power delivery unit. SuperRange complements the power delivery capability of on-chip voltage regulator and off-chip voltage regulator. On top of SuperRange, we analyze its power conversion characteristics and propose a voltage regulator (VR) aware power management algorithm. Moreover, as more and more cores have been integrated on a singe chip, multiple SuperRange units can serve as basic building blocks to build, in a highly scalable way, more powerful power delivery subsystem with larger power capacity. Experimental results show SuperRange unit offers 1x and 1.3x higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than other two conventional power delivery schemes at NTV region and exhibits an average 70% PCE over entire operational range. It also exhibits superior resilience to power-constrained systems.",

These types of faults often exist in the software, but some fault classes are hard to detect using traditional testing methods. A general testing method is proposed to detect these types of faults. Furthermore the fault simulation method of the faults is presented which can accelerate the generation of test cases and minimize the testing cost greatly. Our empirical results indicate that our methods require a smaller number of test cases than random testing, while retaining fault-detection capabilities that are as good as, or better than the traditional testing methods.",

        "abstract": "As the feature size shrinks to the nanometer scale, SRAM-based FPGAs will become increasingly vulnerable to soft errors. Existing reliability-oriented placement and routing approaches primarily focus on reducing the fault occurrence probability (node error rate) of soft errors. However, our analysis shows that, besides the fault occurrence probability, the propagation probability (error propagation probability) plays an important role and should be taken into consideration. In this paper, we first propose a cube-based analysis algorithm to efficiently and accurately estimate the error propagation probability. Based on such a model, we propose a novel reliability-oriented placement and routing algorithm that combines both the fault occurrence probability and the error propagation probability together to enhance system-level robustness against soft errors. Experimental results show that, compared with the baseline versatile place and route technique, the proposed scheme can reduce the failure rate by 20.73%, and increase the mean time between failures by 39.44%.",

Trace based debug techniques can improve the observability by acquiring some internal states at runtime through a dedicated on-chip trace buffer. In this paper, we propose a flip-flop clustering based trace signal selection method, which uses the forward tracing to generate flip-flop clusters and evaluates the global state restoration improvement to select the clusters for state capturing. The predecessor flip-flops of the selected cluster are used as trace signals, and the internal flip-flops of the selected clusters are used as snapshot signals. The experimental results show that in comparison with the prior methods, our method can increase the state restoration ratio by 74.8% on average with no more than 1.58% storage overhead for storing snapshots. The runtime for trace signal selection is also much less than those of prior methods.",

As the conventional diagnosis process usually runs on the faulty free scan chain, scan chain faults may disable the diagnostic process, leaving large failure area to time-consuming failure analysis. In this paper, a design-for-diagnosis (DFD) technique is proposed to diagnose faulty scan chains precisely and efficiently, moreover, with the assistant of the proposed technique, the conventional logic diagnostic process can be carried on with faulty scan chains. The proposed approach is entirely compatible with conventional scan-based design. Previously proposed software-based diagnostic methods for conventional scan designs can still be applied to our design. Experiments on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed DFD technique.\n\n",

        "abstract": "As an energy-efficient hardware solution for deep neural network (DNN) inference, systolic accelerators are particularly popular in both embedded and datacenter computing scenarios. Despite their excellent performance and energy efficiency, however, systolic DNN accelerators are naturally facing a resource under-utilization problem - not all DNN models can well match the fixed processing elements (PEs) in a systolic array implementation, because typical DNN models vary significantly from applications to applications. Consequently, state-of-the-art hardware solutions are not expected to deliver the nominal (peak) performance and energy efficiency as claimed because of resource under-utilization. To deal with this dilemma, this study proposes a novel systolic DNN accelerator with a flexible computation mapping and dataflow scheme. By providing three types of parallelism and dynamically switching among them: channel-direction mapping, planar mapping, and hybrid, our accelerator offers the adaptability to match various DNN models to the fixed hardware resources, and thus, enables flexibly exploiting PE provision and data reuse for a wide range of DNN models to achieve optimal performance and energy efficiency.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Large scale Chip-Multiprocessors (CMPs) generally employ Network-on-Chip (NoC) to connect the last level cache (LLC), which is generally organized as distributed NUCA (non-uniform cache access) arrays for scalability and efficiency. On the other hand, aggressive technology scaling induces severe reliability problems, causing on-chip components (e.g., cores, cache banks, routers) failure due to manufacture defects or on-line hardware faults. Typical degradable CMPs should possess the ability to work around defects by disabling faulty components. For static NUCA architecture, when cache banks attached to a computing node are disabled, however, certain physical address sections will no longer be accessible. Prior approaches such as sets reduction introduced in Intel Xeon processor 7100 series enable turning off cache banks by masking certain sets bits in physical address1, which greatly wastes cache capacity. In this paper, we propose to tackle the above problem in a finer granularity to restrict the capacity loss in NUCA cache. Cache accesses to isolated nodes are redirected based on the utility-driven address remapping scheme that reduces data blocks conflicts in fault-tolerant shared-LLC. We evaluate our technique using GEMS simulator. Experimental results show that address remapping achieves significant improvement over the conventional cache sizing scheme.",

This work proposes CuckooPIM, a criticality-aware and less-blocking coherence mechanism, which can effectively avoid unnecessary data movements and stalls.

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accelerators are rapidly growing in popularity as a promising solution for deep learning based applications. Though optimizations on computation have been intensively studied, the energy efficiency of such accelerators remains limited by off-chip memory accesses since their energy cost is magnitudes higher than other operations. Minimizing off-chip memory access volume, therefore, is the key to further improving energy efficiency. However, we observed that sticking to minimizing the accesses of one data type as many prior work did cannot fit the varying shapes of convolutional layers in CNNs. Hence, there exists a dilemma of minimizing the accesses of which data type. To overcome the problem, this paper proposed an adaptive layer partitioning and scheduling scheme, called SmartShuttle, to minimize off-chip memory accesses for CNN accelerators. Smartshuttle can adaptively switch among different data reuse schemes and the corresponding tiling factor settings to dynamically match different convolutional layers. Moreover, SmartShuttle thoroughly investigates the impact of data reusability and sparsity on the memory access volume. The experimental results show that SmartShuttle processes the convolutional layers at 434.8 multiply and accumulations (MACs)/DRAM access for VGG16 (batch size = 3), and 526.3 MACs/DRAM access for AlexNet (batch size = 4), which outperforms the state-of-the-art approach (Eyeriss) by 52.2% and 52.6%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Trace signal selection is of great importance for post-silicon debug. Debuggers traditionally use state restoration to improve the observability of the trace data, and state restoration ratio (SRR) is computed after state restoration. In this paper, we exploit the combination of snapshot states and trace states to improve the observability. First, we propose a novel state restoration method, called cluster restoration. It uses both the snapshot states of flip-flop clusters at the beginning of tracing, and the tracing states of the clusters\u2019 inputs during the tracing window to deterministically restore all states of these clusters during the tracing window. We also present a cluster restoration-based trace signal selection method to select clusters instead of trace signals directly, which includes two stages: 1) cluster generation and 2) cluster evaluation. For cluster generation, feedback loop-based cluster generation and backward tracing-based cluster generation techniques are proposed. For cluster evaluation, a new metric, called the global state restoration improvement is proposed to evaluate the candidate clusters. The experimental results show that in comparison to prior trace signal selection methods, our method can improve the SRR and reduce the runtime of trace signal selection as well.",

However, the power saving may be offset by power loss in power delivery; moreover, as the efficiency of power delivery varies greatly with different load conditions, conventional power delivery designs cannot maintain high efficiency over the entire voltage range. We propose SuperRange, a wide operational range power delivery scheme. SuperRange complements the power delivery capability of on-chip voltage regulator and off-chip voltage regulator. Experimental results show SuperRange has an average 70% power conversion efficiency over wide operational range which outperforms conventional power delivery schemes.

        "abstract": "Soft Errors have emerged as a key challenge to microprocessor design. Traditional soft error tolerance techniques (such as redundant multithreading and instruction duplication) can achieve high fault coverage but at the cost of significant performance degradation. Prior research reports that soft errors can be masked at the architecture level, and the degree of such masking, named as architecture vulnerability factor (AVF), can vary significantly across workloads and individual structures, hence strict redundant execution may not be necessary for soft error tolerance. In this work, we exploit the AVF varying feature to adaptively tune reliability and performance. We present an infrastructure to online compute and predict AVF for three microprocessor structures (IQ, ROB, and LSQ), guiding when the protection scheme should be activated to improve reliability. Experimental results show that our method can efficiently compute the AVF for different structures independent of hardware configurations. The average differences between our method and a prior offline AVF computing method are 0.10, 0.01, and 0.039 for IQ, ROB, and LSQ, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Without appropriate stitching of scan chains, even with good diagnosis algorithm and diagnostic pattern generation, it may still result in bad scan chain diagnostic resolution. To improve the diagnostic resolution, we propose a novel Diagnosis and Layout Aware (DLA) scan chain stitching method, which is pattern independent and supports embedded scan compaction. It is based on three ideas: (1) increasing the number of sensitive scan cells, which can capture useful diagnostic information; (2) properly distributing the sensitive scan cells along the scan chains to enhance the overall resolution; (3) stitching scan cells based on their placement at layout to preserve the chip performance. Experiments on ISCAS'89/ITC'99 benchmark circuits and a real industry circuit based on 20nm technology with silicon results show that, the proposed DLA scan chain stitching method effectively improves the resolution, with negligible impact on chip performance, embedded scan compaction, transition fault coverage, and test power dissipation. The silicon results even show 7X average resolution improvement comparing to without using the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) System-on-Chips (SoCs) that typically employ through-silicon vias (TSVs) as vertical interconnects, emerge as a promising solution to continue Moore's law. Whereas, it also brings challenging problems, one of which is the test wrapper chain design and optimization, especially for circuit-partitioned 3D SoCs in which scan chains can cross among layers. Test time is the primary goal for wrapper chain design, both for 2D and 3D SoCs. The 3D SoC wrapper chain design problem can be converted into the well-studied2D one by projecting wrapper chain components of all layers to one virtual layer. Thereafter, we can leverage 2D optimization algorithms to determine the composition of wrapper chains and thus guarantee minimal testing time for 3D SoCs. One specific thing for circuit-partitioned 3D SoCs is that TSVs are needed to connect cross-layer wrapper structures to form the wrapper chains. As TSVs occupy planar chip area and will aggravate the routing congestion problem, it is necessary to reduce TSVs for test purpose as much as possible. In this work, we observe that by varying the connection orders of wrapper chain components, e.g., scan chains and I/O cells, the TSVs consumed vary significantly. Based on the above, we formulate this problem and propose novel heuristic to tackle it. Experimental results show that the proposed solution can save on average 33.2% amount of TSVs when compared to a prior intuitive method.",

        "abstract": "Recently, neural network (NN) accelerators are gaining popularity as part of future heterogeneous multi-core architectures due to their broad application scope and excellent energy efficiency. Additionally, since neural networks can be retrained, they are inherently resillient to errors and noises. Prior work has utilized the error tolerance feature to design approximate neural network circuits or tolerate logical faults. However, besides high-level faults or noises, timing errors induced by delay faults, process variations, aging, etc. are dominating the reliability of NN accelerator under nanoscale manufacturing process. In this paper, we leverage the error resiliency of neural network to mitigate timing errors in NN accelerators. Specifically, when timing errors significantly affect the output results, we propose to retrain the accelerators to update their weights, thus circumventing critical timing errors. Experimental results show that timing errors in NN accelerators can be well tamed for different applications.",

We observed that the applications following SPMD (Single Program and Multiple Data) programming model tend to spark domain-wide voltage resonance because multiple threads sharing the same function body exhibit similar power activity. When threads are judiciously relocated among the cores, the voltage droops can be greatly reduced. We propose \"Orchestrator\", a sensor-free non-intrusive scheme for multi-core architectures to smooth the voltage droops. Orchestrator focuses on the inter-core voltage interactions, and maximally leverages the thread diversity to avoid voltage droops synergy among cores. Experimental results show that Orchestrator can reduce up to 64% voltage emergencies on average, meanwhile improving performance.",

        "abstract": "With the continual scaling of semiconductor process technology, the circuit timing is increasingly impacted by process variations. It is thus important to categorize high-speed digital circuits into multiple bins of different performances. However, the speed-binning process typically needs very long test application time. In this paper, we proposed a unified architecture, which can accomplish performance grading with a high confidence and short test application time. Moreover, the proposed architecture can be used for on-line circuit failure prediction and detection. Experimental results are presented to validate the proposed architecture.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Secure passwords need high entropy, but are difficult for users to remember. Password managers minimize the memory burden by storing site passwords locally or generating secure site passwords from a master password through hashing or key stretching. Unfortunately, they are threatened by the single point of failure introduced by the master password which is vulnerable to various attacks such as offline attack and shoulder surfing attack. To handle these issues, this paper proposes the PUFPass, a secure password management mechanism based on software/hardware codesign. By introducing the hardware primitive, Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), into PUFPass, the random physical disorder is exploited to strengthen site passwords. An illustration of PUFPass in the Android operating system is given. PUFPass is evaluated from aspects of both security and preliminary usability. The security of the passwords is evaluated using a compound heuristic algorithm based PUF attack software and an open source password cracking software, respectively. Finally, PUFPass is compared with other password management mechanisms using the Usability-Deployability-Security (UDS) framework. The results show that PUFPass has great advantages in security while maintaining most benefits in usability.",

When these defects manifested as scan chain faults and system logic faults, we call such faults as compound faults.

        "abstract": "The limited write endurance is one of the major obstacles for phase-change random access {memory (PRAM)-based} main memory. Traditionally, wear-leveling (WL) techniques were proposed to enhance its lifetime by balancing write traffic. However, these techniques do not concern the endurance variation in PRAM chips. When different PRAM cells have distinct endurance, balanced writes results in lifetime degradation due to the weakest cells. In this paper, we first define a new metric-wear rate (i.e., writes/endurance) considering both the write traffic and endurance distribution from application and hardware, respectively. After investigating the writing behavior of applications and endurance variation, we propose an architecture-level leveling mechanism to balance wear rate of cells across the PRAM chip. Hardware and algorithm to support the proposed leveling mechanism are presented. Moreover, there is an important tradeoff between endurance improvement and swapping data volume. To co-optimize endurance and swapping, this situation is formulated as a maximum weight perfect matching problem in bipartite graph. Thereafter, a novel algorithm that minimizes wear-rate and swapping by employing Kuhn-Munkras algorithm is proposed to maximize PRAM lifetime and minimize performance degradation. The experimental results show ~17x lifetime improvement over prior WL.",

        "abstract": "Thread-level redundancy in Chip Multiprocessors(TLR-CMP) is efficient for soft error tolerance. Process variation causes core-to-core (C2C) performance asymmetry across a chip, which should be taken into consideration for application scheduling. In this paper, two types of variations beyond C2C are introduced, i.e., inter-pair and intra-pair variation in TLR-CMP. Intra-pair performance asymmetry can affect the performance of applications differently. Based on the above observation, we firstly formalize the variation aware scheduling in TLR-CMP as a 0-1 programming problem,to maximize the system weighted throughput. An efficient scheduling algorithm, named IntraVarF&AppSen, is then proposed to tackle this problem, which can be proved to be optimal when the number of applications to be scheduled is equal to the number of core pairs. Simulation on a 64-core CMP shows 2.8%-4% improvement in weighted throughput when compared to prior VarF&AppIPC algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Data compression has been intensively studied to increase the utility of cache, network-on-chip (NoC), and main memory in energy-efficient processors. However, prior solutions to data compression often add remarkable compression and decompression delay to the critical path of memory access, which is thought as the major factor limiting its application to commodity processors. Unlike prior work that deals with memory compression or network compression separately, this paper proposes a unified on-chip distributed data compressor (DISCO), to enable near-zero-latency cache and memory block compression for chip multiprocessors adopting nonuniform cache access. DISCO integrates a multimode cache compressor into the NoC routers and overlaps the de/compression latency with the queuing delay in the network. In addition, cache block evicted to or fetched from the main memory can also be compressed or decompressed during the network queuing time in this unified DISCO compressor. With the support of congestion-awareness, it is shown in the evaluation that DISCO, which unifies the compression solution of the memory hierarchy, dramatically decreases the compression overhead of isolated techniques, and significantly boosts the efficiency of data moving and store.",

This paper proposes a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) based pay-per-device scheme for protecting IPs of CNN models. PUFs are embedded into the FPGA based CNN accelerator. The original CNN model trained by the IP vendor is obfuscated based on the PUFs before being distributed to the end users. The PUF challenges come from obfuscated CNN model parameters, and the PUF responses determine outputs of convolutional layers. In this way, the obfuscated CNN model is limited to be correctly executed in one specific FPGA. Experiments on AlexNet show that performance and hardware overhead of the CNN accelerator are negligible. For authorized end users, the prediction accuracy of the obfuscated CNN model is the same as that of the original one, while for adversaries, prediction accuracies of guessed ones are nearly 0.",

        "title": "An abacus turn model for time/space-efficient reconfigurable routing",
        "abstract": "Applications' traffic tends to be bursty and the location of hot-spot nodes moves as time goes by. This will significantly aggregate the blocking problem of wormhole-routed Network-on-Chip (NoC). Most of state-of-the-art traffic balancing solutions are based on fully adaptive routing algorithms which may introduce large time/space overhead to routers. Partially adaptive routing algorithms, on the other hand, are time/space efficient, but lack of even or sufficient routing adaptiveness. Reconfigurable routing algorithms could provide on-demand routing adaptiveness for reducing blocking, but most of them are off-line solutions due to the lack of a practical model to dynamically generate deadlock-free routing algorithms. In this paper, we propose the abacus-turn-model (AbTM) for designing time/space-efficient reconfigurable wormhole routing algorithms. Unlike the original turn model, AbTM exploits dynamic communication patterns in applications to reduce the routing latency and chip area requirements. We apply forbidden turns dynamically to preserve deadlock-free operations. Our AbTM routing architecture has two distinct advantages: First, the AbTM leads to a new router architecture without adding virtual channels and routing table. This reconfigurable architecture updates the routing path once the communication pattern changes, and always provides full adaptiveness to hot-spot directions to reduce network blocking. Secondly, the reconfiguration scheme has a good scalability because all operations are carried out between neighbors. We demonstrate these advantages through extensive simulation experiments. The experimental results are indeed encouraging and prove its applicability with scalable performance in large-scale NoC applications.",

In this work, we propose XORiM, an inexpensive PIM design to achieve fast bulky bitwise XOR operation in commodity DRAM devices for memory-intensive workloads. Instead of resorting to 3D-integration or emerging memory technology, we reuse and adapt the peripheral circuits and row-buffers in memory to enable within-DRAM data manipulation. The implemented mechanism can also be employed to conduct high-throughput bulky data operations including memory initialization, AND, OR and INV. We present the detailed circuitry design and transistor-level simulation to evaluate the proposed method, and demonstrate the application of XORiM to realistic workloads by conducting full-system level simulation. The experimental results on data-intensive applications such as deduplication and data encryption show that about 1.5\u00d7 and 5.1\u00d7 overall performance benefits and 4.9\u00d7 and 9.1\u00d7 overall energy savings are achieved respectively by XORiM over conventional computing systems.\n\n",

First, mappings between expanded instructions and signals are obtained through data mining, and they are used to impose value ranges of expanded instructions on component signals and generate instruction-level constraints. Second, virtual circuits are established based on the instruction-level constraints, and test patterns are generated for the constrained components. Third, test patterns are translated into test instructions according to the values of controlling signals and constraints for their mappings to instructions, and an SBST program is produced after assembling the test instructions. Experimental results on the Parwan processor show that the proposed ATIG technique can achieve 94.8% stuck-at fault coverage, which is close to that of the full scan test generation method. In addition, it can cut down 57% test volume of the previous random pattern generation based SBST technique, while the test time reduces to one thirteenth of the previous SBST technique.",

As a critical part of Kinematics, the Inverse Kinematics (IK) will consume more time and energy to figure out the solution with the degrees of freedom increase. It goes beyond the ability of general-purpose processor based methods to provide real-time IK solver for manipulators with high degree of freedom. In this paper, we present a novel parallel algorithm, Quick-IK, based on the Jacobian transpose method. Via speculative searching in parallel, Quick-IK can reduce the number of iterations by 97% for the baseline Jacobian transpose method. In addition, we propose a novel specialized architecture, IKAcc, to boost the energy efficiency of Quick-IK through hardware acceleration. The evaluation shows that IKAcc can solve IK problem in 12 milliseconds for a 100 degrees of freedom manipulator. In addition, IKAcc can achieve 1700x performance speed-up over the CPU implementation of the original Jacobian transpose method and 30x speedup over the GPU implementation of Quick-IK. At same time, IKAcc achieves about 776x higher energy efficiency than the GPU implementation of Quick-IK.",

        "abstract": "Bugs are tending to be unavoidable in the design of complex integrated circuits. It is imperative to identify the bugs as soon as possible by post-silicon debug. The main challenge for post-silicon debug is the observability of the internal signals. This paper exploits the fact that it is not necessary to observe the error free states. Then we introduce \"suspect window\" and present a method for determining its boundary. Based on suspect window, we propose a debug approach to achieve high observability by reusing scan chain. Since scan dumps take place only in suspect window, debug time is greatly reduced. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Emerging highly-parallel and big data applications have renewed the research interest in Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures. However, moving powerful processing unit into the CMOS-incompatible DRAM chips is not cost-effective for large capacity memory. In this work, we observe that Non-Volatile Memory is often naturally incorporated with basic logics like Data Comparison Write or Flip-n-Write modules that are essential for cell SET/REST operation. In contrast to other conventional PIM or Near Data Computing (NDC) architectures, ProPRAM, as a typical Active NVM, abandons the design approach of moving accelerators or customized processors into memory devices, but begins with exploiting the existing resources inside the memory chips to accelerate the key non-compute-intensive functions for emerging big data applications. With slight hardware and architectural modification, we succeed to expose the transparent peripheral logics to the application layer through instruction set extension and exploit them for in-field bulk data processing with limited hardware cost. Compared to conventional CPU-centric systems, ProPRAM achieves an excellent optimization on energy-efficiency (15x) for important data-intensive micro-benchmarks and kernels.",

        "abstract": "With the development of Integrated Circuit (IC), it is a growing trend that the CPU and the FPGA are integrated into one chip. To improve the security of CPU+FPGA IC, we explore the reconfigurable feature of FPGA to implement a novel Dynamically Configured Physical Unclonable Function (DCPUF). PUF is a hardware security primitive that utilizes unpredictable process variations to produce particular challenge-response pairs, so even the chips with the same design would produce different responses for the same challenge. In the DCPUF, the FPGA configuration bits, which are specifically designed with dedicated placement and routing constraint, constitute the challenge. When a challenge is input to a CPU+FPGA IC, the CPU uses it to configure or partially configure the FPGA, and then waits for the FPGA to reply a response. In comparison with existing PUFs, the DCPUF has three major advantages: (1) different from existing PUFs with fixed designs, the logic of DCPUF is dynamically configured for each challenge, i.e. the circuits for producing different responses are different, leading to higher security; (2) much more electronic parameters affected by process variation are leveraged to make DCPUF more robust against attacks; (3) for CPU+FPGA IC, no extra hardware is needed. The experiments on real CPU+FPGA ICs show the proposed DCPUF keeps good randomness and stability.\n\n",

Given topology dynamics and bandwidth constraints, a space-efficient packet marking scheme is first introduced. The scheme uses a Bloom filter as a compression tool so that path information can be piggybacked by data packets. Based on the path information, LoNI then adopts a fast algorithm to detect lossy nodes. The algorithm formulates the inference problem as a weighted set-cover problem and solves it using a greedy approach with low complexity. Simulations show that LoNI can locate about 80% of lossy nodes when lossy nodes are rare in the network. Furthermore, LoNI performs better for the lossy nodes near the sink or with higher loss rates. \u00a9 by HIGH TECHNOLOGY LETTERS PRESS.",

        "abstract": "As the feature size continues to shrink into the nanometer era, the crosstalk-induced effect on circuit timing becomes significant. It is essential that potential crosstalk-induced delay effects should be estimated, identified, tested accurately and quickly. This paper proposes a novel path-based static timing analysis technique for multiple coupling effects. In this method, multiple crosstalk-induced effects are analyzed by considering a critical path and the sub-paths which propagate the transition signals to the aggressor lines coupled to the critical path. A new structure, transition map, is introduced to record all the possible arrival time of a line. Based on it, we can accurately identify the potential crosstalk noise sources, and efficiently find critical paths in presence of crosstalk as well as proper sub-paths to activate maximal coupling effects on a critical path. We can trade off accuracy and runtime by controlling the size of time scale used in transition map, which makes this approach highly scalable. The application of this method to the delay test based on Precise Crosstalk-induced Path Delay Fault model is given. Experiments on ISCAS89 benchmark circuit show the proposed technique can be applied to analysis and test of crosstalk-induced effects for large circuits within an acceptable time.",

When mapping BNNs onto the specialized neural accelerators that adopt fixed-point feature data representation and binary parameters, due to the operation overflow caused by short fixed-point coding, the BNN inference results from the deep learning frameworks on CPU/GPU will be inconsistent with those from the accelerators. This issue leads to a large deviation between the training environment and the inference implementation, and causes potential model accuracy losses when deployed on the accelerators. Therefore, we present a series of methods to contain the overflow phenomenon, and enable typical deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow to effectively train BNNs that could work with high accuracy and convergence speed on the specialized neural accelerators.\n\n",

In this brief, we propose to use PCM as image buffer in application-specific multimedia systems. To improve the lifetime of PCM-based image buffer, we first eliminate redundant writes using data comparison. After redundant write elimination, PCM cells with respect to lower order bits of pixels are written more frequently than those corresponding to higher order. Based on this observation, we show that the lifetime can be further improved either by wear leveling using periodical data reversion to make write traffic even across PCM cells or by application-level error tolerance evaluation without leveling. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed techniques, the lifetime of PCM-based image buffer can be improved significantly.",

This paper analyzes the impact of hazards on small-delay defect (SDD) detection, and presents a new test pattern selection method considering hazards. The concept of arrival time window is introduced and the concept of output deviation is redefined to accurately reflect the pattern capability on SDD detection. A new signal transition probability calculation method is presented to calculate output deviation more practical than that without considering hazards. Patterns from an N-detect test set for transition faults are then selected according to their output deviations.

In this paper, an efficient method integrating logic simulation and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is presented, which can verify the designs with black boxes. This method uses quantified conjunctive normal form (CNF) formulas to represent the unknown constraints in the circuit under verification, and needs no modification of the circuit structure so that it saves the computational resources significantly. In addition, this approach enhances the SAT-based algorithm with random parallel pattern simulation, which improves the capability of detecting errors. The experimental results on the ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits demonstrate that, the proposed approach is faster up to one to three orders of magnitude than those approaches in literature.",

Adding spare rows or columns in memories to replace defective cells is a widely accepted method for yield enhancement. However,existing repair schemes not only have low resource utilization,complex redundancy analysis algorithms,but also greatly depend on the spare structure provided by memory manufactures. Therefore,a repair method using content addressable memory combined with spare rows and columns are proposed in this work. Content addressable memory is not only used to store repair information,but also used as spare words to replace defective words. Meanwhile,spare rows and columns are used to repair row or column address decode defects. A control circuit which controls the access to defective cells is inserted at the output of the address decoder. Advantages of the proposed method are simple implementation,low area overhead,good scalability and high repair rate. Experimental results indicate that the redundancy and content addressable memory area overhead of the proposed repair method is only 20% of other 2D repair methods to obtain the same repair ratio.",

Traditional link estimation methodology works well in the varying case of long time span, but poor in that of short time span. This paper proposes a multi-link cooperative forwarding protocol on fine-grain gradient strategy (MCFS), which can avoid the influence of quality jitters on parts of forwarding links through single-send-multiple-receive plus strategy on the synchronized random contention of ACK. A new channel model was developed on NS2 platform, which could simulate the link quality changing in a short time based on the model of two states non-homogeneous Markov chain. Through this channel model, the following conclusions would be reached: (1) MCFS protocol can adapt and work well with short time varying of link quality; (2) In reasonable configuration, MCFS was quite effective on performances in the network delivery rate and energy efficiency, compared with mono-link optimized protocol by the criteria of HOP/PRR, disjoint and braid multi-path forwarding protocols; (3) The good features of MCFS were independent of both network scale and nodes density of deployment. \u00a9 by Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a test resource partitioning technique based on an efficient response compaction design called quotient compactor(q-Compactor). Because q-Compactor is a single-output compactor, high compaction ratios can be obtained even for chips with a small number of outputs. Some theorems for the design of q-Compactor are presented to achieve full diagnostic ability, minimize error cancellation and handle unknown bits in the outputs of the circuit under test (CUT). The q-Compactor can also be moved to the load-board, so as to compact the output response of the CUT even during functional testing. Therefore, the number of tester channels required to test the chip is significantly reduced. The experimental results on the ISCAS '89 benchmark circuits and an MPEG 2 decoder SoC show that the proposed compaction scheme is very efficient.",

        "abstract": "Phase change memory (PCM) has emerged as a mostly promising non-volatile memory. Multi-level Cell (MLC) PCM that stores multiple bits in a single cell, has the benefits of increasing capacity and lower cost-per-bit. However, as feature size scales down, prior work reports that low frequency noise and random telegraph noise would greatly jeopardize the reliability of MLC PCM. In this paper, we firstly analyze the multi-bit error rate induced by noise and then propose a multi-bit ECC (Error Correction Code) to alleviate the deleterious noise effects in MLC PCM. As far as we know, this is the first paper to utilize of error correction method to mitigate the impact of noise at architectural level. However, a strong multi-bit ECC requires additional storage and latency. Thus, we propose a 6EC-7ED BCH scheme which achieves a tradeoff between correction capability and overhead. Compared to conventional DRAM ECC, this scheme effectively improves the reliability of MLC PCM system, while has the comparable storage overhead. Moreover, the experimental results show this scheme incurs negligible latency cost with merely 1% performance degradation.",

The potential test instructions for PFTPs are stored and the control and data constraints are extracted. Constrained combinational non-robust delay test pattern generation is applied. The final test instructions are composed of controllability instruction (s), potential test instruction (s) and observability instruction (s). The instruction set architecture, register transfer level (RTL) description along with gate level netlist are used in the approach. Experimental results indicate that a significant percentage of functional untestable paths are recognized in early stage and the control and data constraints do a great deal to help generating the test vectors that can be mapped into test instructions for PFTPs. Experimental results also show that the proposed method takes a much shorter CPU time than the earlier work.",

The rationale behind this solution is that transient faults, either in hardware or software, can be fixed by refreshing the machine state. Such a \u201csilver bullet\u201d, however, could be futile in the future because the faults, especially those existing in the hardware such as Integrated Circuit (IC) chips, cannot be eliminated by refreshing. What we need is a more sophisticated mechanism to steer the system back to the right track. The \u201cmagic cure\u201d is the Fault Tolerance On-Chip (FTOC) mechanism, which relies on a suite of built-in design-for-reliability logic, including fault detection, fault diagnosis, and error recovery, working in a self-supportive manner. We have exploited the FTOC to build a holistic solution ranging from on-chip fault detection to error recovery mechanisms to address faults caused by chips progressively aging. Besides fault detection, the FTOC paradigm provides attractive benefits, such as facilitating graceful performance degradation, mitigating the impact of verification blind spots, and improving the chip yield.",

In this paper, we propose a resource efficient trigger design for the post-silicon debug which integrates several different detection schemes to improve the detect ability. The design reuses the trace buffer to store the trigger set for event detection or store the transitions of the generated finite state machine for event sequence detection, which converts the trigger detection into simple read operations to the trace buffer and equality matching operations. Simulation and emulation are both used to validate the usability of the design. In comparison with the prior trigger circuits with the same trigger width, the proposed method provides much more powerful detect ability and configurability for complicated trigger conditions, and needs lower area overhead.",

Relative measures are presented to reflect the gains when controlling a scan cell to a certain value, and guide the scan cell selection. Experimental results on larger IWLS 2005 benchmark circuits show that, to achieve the same fault coverage of the pure launch on capture (LOC) approach, the volume of test data can be reduced to a half on average by replacing only 1% of regular scan cells to enhanced scan cells. The transition delay fault coverage can also be improved using the proposed method with equally low area overhead.",

The method is simulation-based. Firstly, it abstracts RTL behavioral descriptions to Process Controlling Trees (PCT)and Data Dependency Graphs (DDG), which are used for behavioral simulation and data tracing. Transfer faults are extracted from DDG edges, which compose a fault set needed for test generation. Then, simulation begins without specifying inputs in advance, and a request-echo strategy is used to fix some uncertain inputs if necessary. Finally, when the simulation ends, the partially fixed input sequence is the generated test sequence. The proposed request-echo strategy greatly reduces unnecessary backtracking, and always tries to cover uncovered transfer faults. Therefore, the proposed method is very efficient, and generates tests with good quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is better than ARTIST in three aspects: (1) the CPU time is shorter by three orders of magnitude; (2) the test length is shorter by 52%; and (3) the fault coverage is higher by 0.89%.",

In this paper, we propose a low-overhead turn-guided reliable routing scheme named TWiN for the vertical link faults in wireless 3D NoCs. TWiN is deadlock-free without any virtual channels (VCs).

Faster-than-at-speed testing is effective on SDD detection in manufacturing testing, which is always implemented by designing a suite of test signal generation circuits on the chip. Meanwhile, the integration of online aging sensors is becoming attractive in monitoring aging-induced delay degradation in the runtime. These design requirements, if implemented in separate ways, will increase the complexity of a reliable design and consume more die area. In this paper, a unified capture scheme is proposed to generate programmable clock signals for the detection of both SDDs and circuit aging. Our motivation arises from the observations that SDD detection and online aging prediction both need to capture circuit response ahead of the functional clock. The proposed aging-resistant design method enables the offline test circuit to be reused in online operations. Reversed short channel effect is also exploited to make the underlying circuit resilient to process variations. The proposed scheme is validated by intensive HSPICE simulations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness in terms of low area, power, and performance overheads.",

Test compaction has been a de-facto design-for-testability technique to reduce the test cost. However, the compacted test responses make multiple-fault diagnosis rather difficult. When there is no space compactor, the most likely suspect fault is considered producing the failing responses most similar to the failing responses observed from the automatic test equipment. But when compactor exists, those suspect faults may no longer have the same high possibility of being the actual faults. To address this problem, we introduce a novel metric explanation necessity. By using both of the new metric and the traditional metric explanation capability, we evaluate the possibility of a suspect fault to be the actual fault. For ISCAS'89 and ITC'99 benchmark circuits equipped with extreme space compactors, experimental results show that 98.8% of the top-ranked suspect faults hit the actual faults, outperforming a previous work by 11.3%.",

Manufacturing process variations cause core-to-core (C2C) performance asymmetry across the chip, which can be further divided into the asymmetry among core-pairs and the asymmetry within a core-pair. We call them inter- and intra-pair asymmetries, respectively, both of which should be taken into considerations in application scheduling for CMPs with static core coupling. In this paper, we first formulate the above scheduling problem as a 0-1 programming problem to maximize the system Weighted Throughput. An efficient IVF&AppSen algorithm is then proposed, which we prove to be optimal when the number of applications equals to that of core-pairs. We also adapt the Simulated Annealing technique to tackle this problem when applications are less than core-pairs on chip. Simulations on a 64-core CMP shows that the proposed algorithms achieve 2.5-9.3% improvement in Weighted Throughput when compared to prior VarF&AppIPC algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Faster than at-speed testing provides an efficient way for testing of small delay defects (SDDs). It requires test patterns to be delicately classified into groups according to the delay of sensitized paths. Each group of patterns is managed to be applied at certain frequency. In this paper, we propose to generate tests for faster than at-speed testing based on path delay fault (PDF) model and single path sensitization criterion. An effective testable path selection and grouping method is introduced, which could quickly and accurately identify paths whose delay falls into a given delay span. Several techniques are used to improve the efficiency of the testable path selection procedure. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method could achieve high transition fault coverage and high test quality of SDDs with low CPU time.",

        "abstract": "NAND Flash memories have rapidly emerged as a storage class memory such as SSD (Solid State Disk), CF (Compact Flash) Card, SD (Secure Digital Memory) Card. Due to its distinct operation mechanisms, NAND Flash memory suffers from erase/program endurance, data retention and program/read disturbance problems. Specifically, erase and program operation keeps in developing bad blocks during the lifetime of memory chips. Bad blocks are blocks that contain faulty bits but the ECC (Error Correction Code) algorithm cannot correct them. Although wear leveling tries to balance the erase/program operations on different blocks so that all blocks can wear out at a similar pace, new bad blocks still inevitably occur.We propose an in-field testing technique which takes some pages in a block as predictors. Due to wear out faster than the other pages, the predictors will become bad before the other pages in the block become bad. The further questions are (1) how to detect those wearing fast pages so as to use them as predictors, (2) how many predictors are needed to achieve a satisfactory prediction accuracy, (3) misprediction will result in what negative impact on performance and endurance.",

We proposed a novel test generation method based on multiple crosstalk-induced glitch fault model (MCGF). This method can model the fault and generate proper patterns. In order to find the test activating aggressors as many as possible, we first map the objective of test generation into a weighted Max-SAT problem, and then solve it by using SAT solver to get required patterns. The sub-path constraints are added into the SAT problem to ensure that all activated aggressors switch simultaneously at the time the victim switches. Experiments on ISCAS89 benchmark circuit show that the proposed technique can be applied to circuits of reasonable sizes within acceptable time.",

It exploits a variation-aware gate-level statistical aging degradation model to characterize circuit lifetime reliability, identifies a set of worst duty cycles on the inputs of statistically critical gates to estimate the worst delay degradations on these gates. Based on the delay degradation information, statistical gate sizing is performed which enables the manufactured chip to satisfy lifetime reliability constraint in term of low area overhead.",

Since the typical strong PUFs, the arbiter PUF and several its variants, were broken by modeling attacks, many new designs for resisting modeling attacks have been proposed. Do they really achieve their promise, or are they only another pipe dream? This paper targets two PUF designs: the randomized PUF and the obfuscation PUF, which strengthen the arbiter PUF by leveraging the random number and the weak PUF, respectively. A heuristic algorithm is proposed for attacking these PUFs. The algorithm is implemented in CUDA. Some PUFs that cannot be broken in several months by CPU show their vulnerabilities in days by leveraging the GPU acceleration. The experimental results show that, for certain scales of objective PUFs, the prediction accuracy is beyond the reliability of CRPs, indicating successful attacks.",

As an emerging non-volatile memory technology, phase change memory (PCM) will benefit video applications due to its high density, low leakage power and superior scalability. However, PCM consumes high write energy and can only sustain a limited write number. Hence it is necessary to reduce the write number of PCM for video applications. In this paper, we propose SoftPCM to enhance both energy efficiency and lifetime of PCM. SoftPCM utilizes the error tolerance characteristic of video applications to relax the accuracy of write operations. Experimental results show that SoftPCM can reduce 22% writes and thus improve energy efficiency and lifetime of PCM with slight video quality degradation.",

SoC often integrates tens of cores and uses Network-on-Chip (NoC) as its communication infrastructure. To ensure high yield of manycore processors, core-level redundancy is often used as an effective approach to improve the reliability of manycore chips. However, when defective cores are replaced by redundant ones, the NoC topology changes. As a result, a fine-tuned application based on timing parameters given by one topology may not meet the expected timing behavior under the new one. To address this issue, we first define a metric that can measure the timing resemblance between different NoC topologies. Based on this metric, we develop a greedy algorithm to reconfigure a defect-tolerant manycore platform and form a unified application specific virtual topology on which the timing variations caused by the reconfiguration are minimized. Our simulation results clearly indicate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "With the shrink of technology to the nanometer scale, network-on-chip (NOC) has become a reasonable solution for connecting many cores on a single chip. It suffers however from increasingly serious interconnect crosstalk effects, which constrain the overall performance of NOC systems. In this paper, a crosstalk tolerance method is proposed for reducing bus delay on NOC interconnects. Crosstalk-induced latency is predicted by analyzing the possible crosstalk effects of adjacent patterns stored in an NOC router. Transition times of selected bits are then adjusted to relieve these predicted crosstalk-induced effects. Experimental results on interconnects show that the proposed method can achieve the same bus delay reduction as the insertion of extra shielding wires into two adjacent wires, while the proposed method requires no extra wires. Compared with previous methods using a dual rail code, a crosstalk avoidance code, and/or a variable clock, the proposed approach provides a larger reduction of bus delay with less area overhead.",

To handle this issue, we propose the Physical Unclonable Function with Randomized challenge (RPUF). Challenges are randomized by a Random Number Generator (RNG) before inputting to the strong PUF, so to prevent attackers from collecting effective training set for conducting modeling attacks.

        "abstract": "Training large scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is an extremely computation and memory intensive task that requires massive computational resources and training time. Recently, many accelerator solutions have been proposed to improve the performance and efficiency of CNNs. Existing approaches mainly focus on the inference phase of CNN, and can hardly address the new challenges posed in CNN training: the resource requirement diversity and bidirectional data dependency between convolutional layers (CVLs) and fully-connected layers (FCLs). To overcome this problem, this paper presents a new accelerator architecture for CNN training, called TNPU, which leverages the complementary effect of the resource requirements between CVLs and FCLs. Unlike prior approaches optimizing CVLs and FCLs in separate way, we take an alternative by smartly orchestrating the computation of CVLs and FCLs in single computing unit to work concurrently so that both computing and memory resources will maintain high utilization, thereby boosting the performance. We also proposed a simplified out-of-order scheduling mechanism to address the bidirectional data dependency issues in CNN training. The experiments show that TNPU achieves a speedup of 1.5x and 1.3x, with an average energy reduction of 35.7% and 24.1% over comparably provisioned state-of-the-art accelerators (DNPU and DaDianNao), respectively.\n\n",

However, it may have high power density and cause hotspot in test, which can exacerbate crosstalk and delay problems. In this paper, we present an optimal multicast-based testing algorithm for hotspot avoidance by generating multicasting test paths. Considering the thermal factor, we further investigate the paths, analyze the reason of hotspot and the effect of cores' distribution on hotspot, and propose a multicasting paths optimization strategy which is designed to avoid hotspot within identical cores. Experimental results show that the temperature of the many-core chip can be restricted and hotspots can be avoided efficiently.",

In this paper, we address the condition of maximum crosstalk glitch noise considering multiple coupling effects and propose a novel test generation technique for this problem. A multiple crosstalk-induced glitch fault (MCGF) model is introduced, which gives information on one or more sub-paths to be sensitized to generate transitions coupled to a victim line. The test for an MCGF is a 2-vector pattern that sensitizes the transition signal along the sub-path to each aggressor line at the maximum aggressive time (MAT), and propagates the signal on a victim line to an output. A new structure, transition map (TM), is proposed to record all the possible arrival time of a line. The MAT of a victim line is calculated based on effective coupling capacitance (ECC). Therefore, the crosstalk-induced effects can be effectively identified, and exactly activated using the generated test patterns. Experiments on ISCAS89 benchmark circuit show that the proposed technique can be applied to circuits of reasonable sizes within acceptable time.",

The power of an ideal circuit without delay, which can be fast computed, has been used as the evaluation\n criterion for the power of a practical circuit with delay, which needs more computing time, in such fields as fast estimation\n for the average power and the maximum power, and fast optimization for the low test power.

However, the test patterns used by volume diagnosis commonly have low distinguish ability to specific faults. In our experiments, we observe that on average, under automatic generated test patterns, faults in the same fan out free region (FFR) account for only 6% of all possible fault pairs, but their share in total indistinguishable faults is 70%, faults in different FFRs but with the same observation points account for 4% of all fault pairs, but their share in total indistinguishable faults is 22%. Exploiting this fact that faults in the same FFRs are harder to be distinguished, we propose an Automatic Diagnostic Pattern Generation (ADPG) method named Substantial Fault Pairs at-A-Time (SFPAT)-ADPG. By applying a transformed circuit and a new fault list to an existing Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) tool, we generate the compressed test patterns which are also the diagnostic patterns with high distinguish ability for the original circuit. Experiments on ISCAS'89 and ITC'99 benchmark circuits show the effectiveness of the proposed SFPAT-ADPG method.",

A key challenge for statistical lifetime reliability analysis is that an accurate statistical timing model is needed to carefully model practical variation distribution as well as delay correlation. In this work, P 2CLRAF, a circuit lifetime reliability analysis framework is proposed. It calibrates pre-silicon SSTA result by learning the collected data from path delay testing at post-silicon timing validation phase. A neural network inside P2CLRAF is trained to learn variation distribution and delay correlation based on the statistic of path delay testing. The learned information is then fed back to SSTA to further improve the accuracy of circuit lifetime reliability analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed analysis framework. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "As an emerging non-volatile memory technology, phase change memory (PCM) is promising as an alternative for traditional memories such as DRAM. In spite of its non-volatility, high density, low standby power, and resilience to soft errors, PCM has a limited write endurance or lifetime, which means that each PCM cell can only be overwritten finite times. More importantly, limited lifetime potentially provides malicious attackers an opportunity to intentionally aggravate write traffic into PCM. In this paper, from the standpoint of attackers, we propose random stream attacks (RSAK) methods for phase change memory used in video applications. Experimental results show that compared to natural video sequences, RSAK incurs higher total write traffic or worsened lifetime. RSAK also gives hints on how to build a more secure PCM in video applications to counter malicious write streams.",

However, limited achievable performance of microrobotic system prevents it from carrying out complex tasks. Current research work propose customize designs for different applications and incorporate dedicated accelerator for high energy efficiency. However, not only such techniques require significant manual effort and expertise for specified applications, but also the accelerator itself dictates unnegligible amount of chip resources. So in this paper we propose ApproxEye, a partial approximate computation reuse framework to accelerate microrobotic computer vision. Leveraging computation locality, ApproxEye reuses previous \u201csimilar\u201d computations to reduce redundant computations. To squeeze every piece of computation reuse opportunity, ApproxEye proposes to 1) heuristically define optimal reuse granularity and 2) apply adaptive reuse requirements for different computations. Moreover, to reduce latency of computation reuse, ApproxEye tailors a parallel implemented search scheme for approximate computation reuse. Experimental results show ApproxEye could effectively exploit the potential of computation reuse and achieve 57.05% speedup on average.",

Researchers continually proposed various PIM architecture combined with novel memory device or 3D integration technology, but it is still a lack of universal task scheduling method in terms of the new heterogeneous platform. In this paper, we propose a formalized model to quantify the performance and energy of the PIM+CPU heterogeneous parallel system. In addition, we are the first to build a task partitioning and mapping framework to exploit different PIM engines. In this framework, an application is divided into subtasks and mapped onto appropriate execution units based on the proposed PIM-oriented Earliest-Finish-Time (PEFT) algorithm to maximize the performance gains brought by PIM. Experimental evaluations show our PIM-aware framework significantly improves the system performance compared to conventional processor architectures.",

This technique exploits the efficiency of data-flow analysis rather than methods like fault simulation. Hence it can be easily integrated into HDL compilers or simulators.

First, a universal path candidate set $U$, which contains testable long paths, is generated. Second, given a path number threshold, path selection from $U$ is performed with the objective of maximizing the capability to capture potential delay failures. The path selection problem is converted to a minimal space intersection problem, and a greedy path selection heuristics is proposed, the key point of which is to calculate the probability that all the paths in a specified path set meet the delay constraint. Statistical timing analysis technologies and heuristics are used in the calculation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is time efficient and achieves higher probability of capturing delay failures than traditional path selection approaches.",

As a proof, a simplified clock combining algorithm in NTP is introduced into BTS(Broadcast Time Synchronization) protocol. Simulation result reveals that in a 8-hop network consist of 81 Mica2 sensor nodes, the synchronization error of every sensor node varies from 67.70% to 91.58% of that in BTS, except for some resister nodes whose synchronization errors keep unchanged. For all sensor nodes with same hop distance from the time beacon node, the ratio of their average synchronization error to hop distance switches from 19.8 to 15.5 \u03bcS per hop. Furthermore, these improvements cost no extra wireless transmissions. Theoretical analysis shows that these improvements are due to the decrease of the standard deviation of the node's time offset with the time beacon, which is the result of the applying time combination algorithm.",

In order to maximize compaction ratio, a single-output encoder based on check matrix of a (n, n-1, m, 3) convolutional code is presented. When the proposed four theorems are satisfied, the encoder can avoid two and any odd erroneous bit cancellations, handle one unknown bit (X bit) and diagnose one erroneous bit. Two types of encoders are proposed to implement the check matrix of the convolutional code. A large number of X bits can be tolerated by choosing a proper memory size and weight of check matrix, which can also be obtained by an optimized input assignment algorithm. Some experimental results would verify the efficiency of the proposed optimized algorithm.",

Previous work tackles this problem by exploiting various levels of features with multi-scale deep convolutional neural networks. However, most of the local geometric structure related monocular depth cues are lost when being propagated through convolutional neural network. Moreover, the error of depth cues related to local geometric structures is not considered in the loss function. In this work, we propose the GeoCueDepth convolutional neural network to exploit local geometric structure cues and propose a training loss that takes the geometric error into consideration, which significantly improve the performance of depth prediction in both accuracy and sharpness. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves 0.122 average relative error and 0.078 square relative error on the NYU Depth v2 data set, which outperforms state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation approaches.",

        "abstract": "Workload consolidation is widely used in modern cloud processors to reduce total cost of ownership. Performance isolation has to be enforced between consolidated workloads to achieve controllable quality of service. Networks-on-chip (NoCs), as a major shared resource, often incur traffic interference and violate performance isolation criteria. Previous work resorts to strict isolation strategy that partitions NoC into independent regions to isolate core-to-core communication traffic. However, strict isolation either results in low consolidation density or degrades network performance, and more importantly, cannot be applied to memory access traffic. To address these weaknesses, we propose a novel performance isolation strategy in NoC, called relaxed isolation (RISO). It permits underutilized routers and links to be shared by multiple applications, and, at the same time, it keeps the aggregated traffic in check to enforce performance isolation. Experimental results show that RISO could effectively improve consolidation density and network performance in synergy.",

        "abstract": "Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a promising hardware security primitive with broad application prospect. However, the strong PUF with numerous Challenge and Response Pairs (CRPs), e.g. the arbiter PUF, is vulnerable to modeling attacks. There are two major kinds of countermeasures. One is restricting CRP access interface, such as controlled PUF and XOR arbiter PUF, which unfortunately has been broken with the help of side-channels. The other is using non-linear electronic characteristics to produce CRPs, such as the current mirror PUF and the voltage transfer PUF. They are only proved to be resistant to SVM based attack, while no more analysis is further explored so far. In this paper, we propose an attack method based on compound heuristic algorithms of evolution strategy, simulated annealing, and ant colony to efficiently attack these two non-linear PUFs. This paper reveals that current mirror and voltage transfer are still not able to help strong PUF resist attacks. Our experimental results show that the average CRP prediction accuracy is as high as 99%.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in a broad range of applications. As CNN-based methods are often both computation and memory intensive, sparse CNNs have emerged as an effective solution to reduce the amount of computation and memory accesses while maintaining the high accuracy. However, dense CNN accelerators can hardly benefit from the reduction of computations and memory accesses due to the lack of support for irregular and sparse models. This paper proposed a concise convolution rule (CCR) to diminish the gap between sparse CNNs and dense CNN accelerators. CCR transforms a sparse convolution into multiple effective and ineffective ones. The ineffective convolutions in which either the neurons or synapses are all zeros do not contribute to the final results and the computations and memory accesses can be eliminated. The effective convolutions in which both the neurons and synapses are dense can be easily mapped to the existing dense CNN accelerators. Unlike prior approaches which trade complexity for flexibility, CCR advocates a novel approach to reaping the benefits from the reduction of computation and memory accesses as well as the acceleration of the existing dense architectures without intrusive PE modifications. As a case study, we implemented a sparse CNN accelerator, SparseK, following the rationale of CCR. The experiments show that SparseK achieved a speedup of 2.9 \u03c7 on VGG16 compared to a comparably provisioned dense architecture. Compared with state-of-the-art sparse accelerators, SparseK can improve the performance and energy efficiency by 1.8\u03c7 and 1.5\u03c7, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Refresh operations consume substantial energy and bandwidth in high-density DRAM memory. To cope with this issue, Fine-Grained Refresh (FGR) is recently proposed to eliminate unnecessary refresh operations caused by minor weak cells. Even JEDEC's DDR4 DRAM specification announces the support of FGR to make DRAM refresh more scalable. Unfortunately, we observe that the effectiveness of FGR is greatly confined by the procedure of refresh-oblivious device integration because all memory devices within a module have to be controlled and refreshed in a lockstep way after the step of assembly. In this work, we firstly propose to intelligently integrate the \\\"compatible\\\" devices through a pre-assembly testing and retention-aware matching method. Second, we reuse the reconfiguration structure from yield-oriented remapping mechanism in memory chips and propose Microfix to create a balanced distribution of retention time in memory banks through fine-grained row-address tuning. With this optimization architecture, RADAR, we can eliminate the refresh overhead of produced memory modules by 28% on average.",

This two-phase method avoids complex timing processing in ATPG algorithm.

In this paper we extend factored use-definition chains (FUD chains), a mature data structure in compilers, from sequential software to concurrent hardware design, and propose dynamic FUD chains (DFUD chains). Based on it, we present an observability model and an algorithm to evaluate observability-based statement coverage. This technique has several advantages. Firstly, it could be easily integrated into compilers or simulators for hardware description languages, since it utilizes many flow analysis techniques adopted in compilers. Secondly, it can be combined with many controllability metrics, such as statement coverage metric, since the observability model is based on definitions and uses of variables. The proposed technique has been implemented as a prototype tool for Verilog designs, and experimental results show its benefits.",

In this paper, we address the problem of enhanced delay test considering crosstalk-induced effects. Two types of crosstalk-induced delay fault model in related works are analyzed according to their relationship to common delay fault models. The difficulties in test generation using these fault models are shown. Based on the discussion, a single precise crosstalk-induced path delay fault model, S-PCPDF model, is proposed for circuits given delay assignment. A target S-PCPDF fault gives information on a sub-path to be sensitized to generate necessary transitions coupled to a critical path. It is then convenient to enhance conventional path delay fault ATPG algorithms to implement ATPG systems for crosstalk-induced path delay faults by adding the constraints on the sub-path. We then propose two approaches to reducing the number of target S-PCPDF faults. One is based on constraints for side-inputs of paths under test. The other is based on pre-specified states during test generation for the critical path. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits showed that the proposed approaches can reduce the number of target faults significantly and efficiently. The CPU time for fault list reduction and test pattern generation is acceptable for circuits of reasonable sizes.",

        "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks, nodes commonly rely on each other to route messages to the sink node. In this paper, we introduce a highly efficient directed flooding protocol with self-pruning. In directed flooding, a node broadcasts messages, but only the nodes within a limited aperture can forward these messages. However, it is difficult to decide the size of the aperture. If the aperture is small, there exists high probability of adjusting the aperture. Conversely, more than one node will forward the messages if the aperture is large, and this will consume limited energy and bandwidth. We present an approach to avoid many nodes forwarding the message simultaneously. When a node receives the data packet, it waits for a random period to listen to other nodes' acknowledge messages. The node forwards the received packet only if it have not received the acknowledge messages. In this way the network can optimize the overhead and correspondingly reduce the bandwidth and energy used. Simulation results show that our protocol achieves much higher performance compared with the directed flooding without self-pruning. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Small delay defects are posing a serious challenge to the quality and reliability of modern fabricated chips. A promising way for screening the timing-related defects in nanometer technology designs is faster-than-at-speed delay testing. However, the use of external automatic test equipment for faster-than-at-speed delay testing could be costly. In this paper, we present an on-chip frequency-programmable test clock generation method which facilitates faster-than-at-speed delay testing for both launch on capture and launch on shift test frameworks. With a reconfigurable launch-and-capture clock generator (LCCG) embedded on-chip, the required test clock, with a reconfigurable frequency and a high resolution, can be achieved by specifying the control information in the test patterns, which is then used to configure the LCCG. Similarly, the control information regarding test framework and clock signal selection can also be embedded in the test patterns. Experimental results are presented to validate the proposed method. A launch and capture clock generator (LCCG) is proposed for generating faster-than-at-speed test clock with programmable frequencies, which can be used to detect SDDs effectively by reducing the slacks of paths under test.The frequencies of faster-than-at-speed test clocks can be easily programmed by embedding the control information into the test patterns. Moreover, the frequencies of the generated test clocks have a high resolution and can achieve a large dynamic range.Both LOC and LOS test frameworks can be supported by the proposed method. The control information for selecting various test frameworks can also be embedded in the test patterns. The reason of not considering the ES test framework in this paper is that the enhanced scan delay testing approach is rarely used in industry for the unacceptable hardware overhead.With a programmable clock selection signal from the LCCG, a clock signal selector is designed to effectively support the application mode such as scan mode, functional operation mode, and test mode by selecting the required clock signal.Frequency variation of the generated test clock in the presence of process variations is analyzed. A method for preventing yield loss caused by frequency variation is presented, so that the test clock period can be programmed to leave a sufficient margin to avoid yield loss.The hardware overhead of the proposed LCCG and clock signal selector is very low, which isapproximately equal to that of 40 standard muxed-D scan cells and can be ignored by modern designs.",

        "abstract": "As the design complexity increases dramatically, results of functional simulation are usually checked through only a part of signals during design verification. It is important, therefore, to consider the observability of internal signals for effective checking. This paper proposes a static observability analysis method to automatically select internal observation signals, which improves the quality of functional verification. A series of formulas are defined to evaluate observability of internal signals, and an algorithm is proposed to locate the sources of low-observability. Such sources, rather than general hard-to-observe signals, are desirable internal observation signals. Experimental results indicate that signals selected by this method can improve the observability of designs more than those randomly selected from hard-to-observe signals.",

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is better than ARTIST [5] in three aspects: on average, the CPU time is shorter by three orders of magnitudes, the test length isshorter by 52% and the fault coverage is higher by 0.89%.",

Power analysis methods at lower design levels achieve very good accuracy, but they are very complicated, and the runtime and memory require are often very hard to accept. To deal with these problems, the power analysis method in architectural level is discussed. The method can obtain the aim of high-level power simulation by accurate cycle-by-cycle performance simulation, where the models of different functional modules are made separately. Architectural level power analysis makes the power optimization of architectural-level, instruction set level, compiler and software become possible. Experiments are set up by the use of Wattch, a general purposed CPU architectural-level power simulator, to demonstrate the power behavioral of data and instruction caches. The results show that power analysis at architectural level can guide the design of low-power system greatly.",

So far, experts from industry and academia have proposed a series of solutions, mainly including physical methods, security protocols based on cryptography, hardware encryption technique and so on. However, various defects still exist in all the three categories, which may lead to the failure to achieve the security requirements of RFID systems. Aiming to make a further improvement to these solutions, we propose a security mechanism designed with dependable proxy in this paper, which demonstrates a good fusion of physical methods and security protocols. In allusion to the new scheme, we use BAN logic to do the formal analysis to derive the security objectives of our mechanism. Subsequently, given the corresponding theoretic analysis and comparison, it is indicated that the new mechanism can efficiently defend RFID systems against monitoring, deception, tracking, replay attacks, and greatly decrease the possibility of suffering denial of service. The asynchronous problem that may arise on systemic information is also discussed to lessen the authentication failure of the legal tags. \u00a9 2011.",

Euler loop is then used to compact MT test patterns and get optimized MT compacted set without losing fault coverage. Then, a self-testing program for MT fault model is developed to apply the MT compacted set to on-line at-speed detecting of crosstalk-induced faults.

        "abstract": "Traditional time unrolling based circuit delay calculation method is inefficient in the case that large circuits are analyzed or accurate delay models are adopted.In order to speedup circuit delay calculation,an improved method by sub-circuit extraction is proposed in this paper.On one hand,a sub-circuit is constructed by analyzing output constraints and extracting related logic cones from the unrolled circuit.The circuit delay is checked on the extracted sub-circuit instead of the unrolled circuit,thus the calculation process is speeded up.On the other hand,the concept of abstract circuit is proposed and preprocess is applied on it to find out the shared structures among extracted sub-circuits.The learning clauses derived from preprocessing can be utilized to speed up SAT solving at each checking step.Experimental results on ISCAS85 and ISCAS89 benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the efficiency of circuit delay calculation by about 8 times over the traditional method on average.",

In this paper, an observation point oriented Deterministic Diagnostic Pattern Generation (DDPG) method was proposed for compound defects, which tolerates the system defects during scan chain diagnosis. Instead of sensitizing multiple paths proposed in our prior work, the proposed new DDPG method directly targets as many observation points as possible to observe the loading error occurred on the targeted scan cell. Experimental results on ISCAS\u201989 benchmark circuits show that the proposed DDPG method improves the effectiveness and efficiency of diagnosing compound defects, compared to our prior research",

        "abstract": "Traditional DVFS schemes are oblivious to fine-grained adaptability resulting from path-grained timing imbalance. With the awareness of such fine-grained adaptability, better power-performance efficiency can be obtained. We propose a new approach, MicroFix, to exploit such fine-grained adaptability. We first reveal the potential of the path-grained timing imbalance and then present a novel implementation of MicroFix. Moreover, to eliminate the conservative margins of traditional DVFS, unlike the previous approaches that reactively handle the delay errors (induced by aggressively scaled voltage/frequcncy) by error detection and recovery strategies, we propose a proactive approach by error prediction. MicroFix was evaluated based on the floating-point unit adopted by OpenSPARC T1 processor. Compared against traditional DVFS schemes, the experimental results shows that MicroFix improves the EDP (Energy-Delay Product) up to 35% for high-performance circuits and PDP (Power-Delay Product) to 28% for low-power circuits, while at the expense of only 7% area overhead.",

Most of the property coverage metrics are based on mutation coverage, obtained by mutating the design and checking the propertyu0027s ability to detect the mutation. Due to the complexity of computing mutation coverage in model checking, the previous methods resort to some approximate algorithms which tend to give pessimistic estimation of state coverage, and can only deal with a limited subset of Computation Tree Logic (CTL). In this paper, we present an improved algorithm to compute mutation coverage for arbitrary CTL formulas with high accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can identify a great number of covered states missed by a previous method. Meanwhile, the extension to the complete CTL set makes it easy to write all kinds of properties to describe the features of the design better.",

Power gating is a powerful and applicable solution to reduce both dynamic power consumption and static power consumption. Maximum current is a significant parameter for power-gated circuit designs, which is determined by the maximum of all possible power-up and normal switching current. How to estimate the maximum current of a power-gated circuit quickly and accurately is a new problem. Hazards are found to consume a significant part of total power during runtime. We do an experiment and observe that hazards exit during powering up phase as well as normal runtime and dissipate a great deal of energy. A new method based on genetic algorithm is proposed to estimate the maximum power-up current for combinational circuits considering hazard power consumption. The experimental results with the ISCAS85 benchmark circuits show power-gated circuits may consume larger maximum current in powering up phase than that in normal runtime phase and our algorithm can obtain 12.90% improvement of maximum power-up current within only 2.77% time of random simulation due to its lower time complexity.",

A key challenge for statistical lifetime reliability analysis is that an accurate statistical timing model is needed to carefully model practical variation distribution as well as delay correlation. In this work, P2CLRAF, a circuit lifetime reliability analysis framework is proposed. It calibrates pre-silicon SSTA result by learning the collected data from path delay testing at post-silicon timing validation phase. A neural network inside P2CLRAF is trained to learn variation distribution and delay correlation based on the statistic of path delay testing.

        "abstract": "Homogeneous manycore processors are emerging in broad application areas, including those with timing requirements, such as real-time and embedded applications. Typically, these processors employ Network-on-Chip (NoC) as the communication infrastructure and core-level redundancy is often used as an effective approach to improve the yield of manycore chips. For a given application's task graph and a task to core mapping strategy, the traffic pattern on the NoC is known a priori. However, when defective cores are replaced by redundant ones, the NoC topology changes. As a result, a fine-tuned program based on timing parameters given by one topology may not meet the expected timing behavior under the new one. To address this issue, a timing similarity metric is introduced to evaluate timing resemblances between different NoC topologies. Based on this metric, a Hungarian method based algorithm is developed to reconfigure a defect-tolerant manycore platform and form a unified application specific virtual core topology of which the timing variations caused by such reconfiguration are minimized. Our case studies indicate that the proposed metric is able to accurately measure the timing differences between different NoC topologies. The standard deviation between the calculated difference using the metric and the difference obtained through simulation is less than 6.58%. Our case studies also indicate that the developed Hungarian method based algorithm using the metric performs close to the optimal solution in comparison to random defect-redundant core assignments. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

In this paper, we put forward an average leakage current macromodeling for dual-threshold circuits and propose two methods to conquer it, table-lookup based simulation and statistical analysis. The simulation is an efficient general-purposed method for leakage current estimation. For stochastic input circuits, a new statistical method is presented, which is much faster than the former one and can be used for very large circuits, because the method is based on input Signal probability and only one pass of circuit is needed. To validate these two methods, accurate leakage currents are also calculated using popular simulator HSPICE for comparison. Experiments on ISCAS85 and ISCAS89 benchmarks demonstrate that the errors between them can be limited under 4% and thousand folds of time to results can be saved.",

        "title": "PSI Conscious Write Scheduling: Architectural Support for Reliable Power Delivery in 3-D Die-Stacked PCM.",
        "abstract": "In 3-D-stacked memory chips, the problem of power supply integrity (PSI) is aggravating due to the additional through-silicon-via resistance and the higher current density in 3-D power delivery network. In particular, for the 3-D phase-change memory (PCM) well known for its high-amplitude programming current, IR-drop violation poses a serious threat that enforces a strict guard band of requesting concurrence, and consequently reduces the write throughput. This paper presents the implication of an IR-drop phenomenon in a 3-D PCM cube, and investigates IR-drop\u2019s impacts on write management in the PCM. From the obtained SPICE simulation results, we find that the issued writes have to meet the IR-drop constraint to be reliably processed, and then propose a PSI conscious write scheduler to improve the write performance within the constraint of the IR-drops and the power budget in the 3-D PCM cube. First, a Bloom-filter-based method is proposed to avoid the invalid write decisions for the PCM. Second, to support fine-grained write management in the cutting-edge PCM, we develop an inexpensive approach, weighted token assignment (WTA), to filter out PSI-unsafe write decisions by employing a support vector machine-based learning model. Last, a write reordering policy is proposed to cooperate with WTA and optimize the total write throughput for better memory performance. In the simulated hybrid main memory composed of both dynamic random access memory and 3-D PCM, the proposed scheduler significantly improves the write throughput.",

        "abstract": "Enhanced scan delay testing approach can achieve high transition delay fault coverage by a small size of test pattern set but with significant hardware overhead. Although the implementation cost of launch on capture (LOC) approach is relatively low, the generated pattern set for testing delay faults is typically very large. In this paper, we present a novel flip-flop selection method to combine the respective advantages of the two approaches, by replacing a small number of selected regular scan cells with enhanced scan cells, thus to reduce the overall volume of transition delay test patterns effectively. Moreover, higher fault coverage can also be obtained by this approach compared to the standard LOC approach. Experimental results on larger ISCAS-89 and ITC-99 benchmark circuits using a commercial test generation tool show that the volume of test patterns can be reduced by over 70% and the transition delay fault coverage can be improved by up to 8.7%.",

However, conventional serial connection of internal scan chains incurs power and time penalty. Study shows that the distribution and high density of don't care bits (X-bits) in test patterns make scan slices overlapping and partial overlapping possible. A novel parallel CWD (pCWD) approach is presented in this paper for lowering test power by shortening wrapper scan chains and adjusting test patterns. In order to achieve shift time reduction from overlapping in pCWD, a two-phase process on test pattern: partition and fill, is presented. Experimental results on d695 of ITC2002 benchmark demonstrated the shift time and test power have been decreased by 1.5 and 15 times, respectively. In addition, the proposed pCWD can be used as a stand-alone time reduction technique, which has better performance than previous techniques.",

In terms of the implementation, we propose the Differential Counter Cluster (DCC) synchronous mechanism to synchronize the data trans- mission, and the Delay Active Shielding (DAS) to protect some critical signals from crosstalk and optimize the routing area over- head. The BAT is scalable with the variation of bus width with little extra implementation complexity. The effectiveness of BAT is evaluated by focusing on the on-chip buses of a super- scalar microprocessor simulator using the SPEC CPU2000 bench- marks.

        "abstract": "The confluence of 3-D integration and network-on-chip (NoC) provides an effective solution to the scalability problem of on-chip interconnects. In 3-D integration, through-silicon via (TSV) is considered to be the most promising bonding technology. However, TSVs are also precious link resources because they consume significant chip area and possibly lead to routing congestion in the physical design stage. In addition, TSVs suffer from serious yield losses that shrink the effective TSV density. Thus, it is necessary to implement a TSV-economical 3-D NoC architecture in cost-effective design. For symmetric 3-D mesh NoCs, we observe that the TSVs bandwidth utilization is low and they rarely become the contention spots in networks as planar links. Based on this observation, we propose the TSV sharing (TS) scheme to save TSVs in 3-D NoC by enabling neighboring routers to share the vertical channels in a time division multiplexing way. We also investigate different TS implementation alternatives and show how TS improves TSV-effectiveness (TE) in multicore processors through a design space exploration. In experiments, we comprehensively evaluate TSs influence on all layers of system. It is shown that the proposed method significantly promotes TE with negligible performance overhead.",

Among these methods, abstraction-guided simulation is a quite promising one. In this paper, we propose an abstraction-guided simulation approach aiming to cover hard-to-reach states in functional verification of microprocessors. A Markov model is constructed utilizing the high level functional specification, i.e. ISA. Such model integrates vector correlations. Furthermore, several strategies utilizing abstraction information are proposed as an effective guidance to the test generation. Experimental results on two complex microprocessors show that our approach is more efficient in covering hard-to-reach states than similar methods. Comparing with some work with other intelligent engines, our approach could guarantee higher hit ratio of target states without efficiency loss.",

        "abstract": "Phase change memory (PCM) is a promising non-volatile memory technology developed as a possible DRAM replacement. Although it offers the read latency close to that of DRAM, PCM generally suffers from the long write latency. Long write request may block the read requests on the critical path of cache/memory access, incurring adverse impact on the system performance. Besides, the write performance of PCM is very asymmetric, i.e, the SET operation (writing '1') is much slower than that of the RESET operation (writing '0'). In this work, we re-examine the resistance transform process during the SET operation of PCM and propose a novel Partial-SET scheme to alleviate the long write latency issue of PCM. During a write access to a memory line, a short Partial-SET pulse is applied first to program the PCM cells to a pre-stable state, achieving the same write latency as RESET. The partially-SET cells are then fully programmed within the retention window to preserve the data integrity. Experimental results show that our Partial-SET scheme can improve the memory access performance of PCM by more than 45% averagely with very marginal storage overhead.",

        "abstract": "There are two approaches to improve the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): 1) accelerating computation and 2) reducing the amount of computation. The acceleration approaches take the advantage of CNN computing regularity which enables abundant fine-grained parallelisms in feature maps, neurons, and synapses. Alternatively, reducing computations leverages the intrinsic sparsity of CNN neurons and synapses. The sparsity represents as the computing \u201cbubbles\u201d, i.e. zero or tiny-valued neurons and synapses. These bubbles can be removed to reduce the volume of computations.Although distinctly different from each other in principle, we find that the two types of approaches are not orthogonal to each other. Even worse, they may conflict to each other when working together. The conditional branches introduced by some bubble-removing mechanisms in the original computations destroy the regularity of deeply nested loops, thereby impairing the intrinsic parallelisms. Therefore, enabling the synergy between the two types of approaches is critical to arrive at superior performance. This paper proposed a relaxed synchronous computing architecture, FlexFlow-Pro, to fulfill this purpose. Compared with the state-of-the-art accelerators, the FlexFlow-Pro gains more than 2.5x performance on average and 2x energy efficiency.",

Because q-Compactor is a single-output compactor, high compaction ratios can be obtained even for chips with a small number of outputs. Some theorems for the design of q-Compactor are presented~to achieve full diagnostic ability, minimize error cancellation and handle unknown bits in the outputs of the circuit under test (CUT). The q-Compactor can also be moved to the load-board, so as to compact the output response of the CUT even during functional testing. Therefore, the number of tester channels required to test the chip is significantly reduced. The experimental results on the ISCAS \u201889 benchmark circuits and an MPEG 2 decoder SoC show that the proposed compaction scheme is very efficient.",

        "abstract": "Voltage emergency (VE) has become a critical challenge with decreasing feature size and increasing power capacity. Destructive core interference is one main source of VE in multicore processors. We observed that the applications following single program and multiple data programming model tend to spark domain-wide destructive core interference because multiple threads exhibit similar power activity. We analyze and quantify this effect and propose one low-cost solution, Orchestrator, to avoid voltage droop synergy among cores. Orchestrator leverages the thread diversity to smooth voltage droops in multicore architectures based on thread scheduling. The thread migration impact on performance is also considered. Experimental results show that Orchestrator can significantly reduce VEs, thereby improving performance.",

Since circuit-width is a good measure of circuit complexity, in this paper, a circuit-width based heuristic for Boolean reasoning is presented, it can be used for integrating the BDD-based engine and SAT-based engine, and takes advantages of both engines. Thus this heuristic can avoid the potential memory explosion during constructing the BDDs, and can prevent the time-out phenomenon of SAT techniques. Compared with the previous heuristics, the proposed heuristic can save more computational resources, and can improve the performance of Boolean reasoning algorithms. This heuristic has been applied in combinational circuit test generation successfully. Experimental results show that, the proposed heuristic can be used for the Boolean reasoning with multiple engines efficiently.",

With some necessary static timing analysis, the target crosstalkinduced delay fault set was reduced. And the delay test generation for crosstalk-induced delay faults can be implemented by few alterations of non-robust path delay test generation algorithms whereas the timing information is only considered during the selection of target faults.

Traffic analysis, conducted by the attacker, could reveal the protocol being carried out by the components. Furthermore, having inferred the protocol, the attacker can use the pattern of the messages as a guide to the most critical components. We thwart these directed attacks by using message forwarding to reduce traffic differences, thus diverge attackers from targeted attack to random attack, which probabilistically prolongs the availability of important components in the system. The simulation results also show that message forwarding effectively balance the traffic flow and hence indicate the validity of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Streaming processing is an important and growing class of applications for analyzing continuous streams of real time data. Sliding-window aggregations (SWAGs) dominate the computation time in such applications and dictate an unprecedented computation capacity which poses a great challenge to the computing architectures. General-purpose processors cannot efficiently handle SWAGs because of the specific computation patterns. This paper proposes an efficient accelerator architecture for ubiquitous SWAGs, called ShuntFlow. ShuntFlow is a typical type of Kernel Processing Unit (KPU) where \"Kernel\" represent two main categories of SWAG operations widely used in streaming processing. Meanwhile, we propose a shunt rule to enable ShuntFlow to efficiently handle SWAGs with arbitrary parameters. As a case study, we implemented ShuntFlow on an Altera Arria 10 AX115N FPGA board at 150 MHz and compared it to previous approaches. The experimental results show that ShuntFlow provides a tremendous throughput and latency advantage over CPU and GPU implementations on both reduce-like and index-like SWAGs.\n\n",

With the awareness of such fine-grained adaptability, better power-performance efficiency can be obtained. We propose a new scheme, MicroFix, to exploit such fine-grained adaptability. We first show the potential resulted from the path-grained timing imbalance and then present a new technique, Timing Interpolation, to reap the fine-grained adaptability for power reduction. Moreover, to eliminate the conservative margins of traditional DVFS, unlike the previous approaches such as Razor that reactively handle the delay errors (induced by aggressively scaled voltage/frequcncy) by enabling error detection and recovery, we propose a proactive approach by error prediction, thereby obviate the high-cost recovery routines. MicroFix was evaluated based on ISCAS89 benchmarks and the floating-point unit adopted by OpenSPARC T1 processor. Compared to ideal traditional DVFS schemes, the experimental results show that for most of the evaluated circuits, MicroFix can help saving up to 20&percnt; power consumption without compromising with frequency, at the expense of less than 5&percnt; area overhead. Compared to nonideal DVFS schemes (with 10&percnt; voltage margin), the power reduction can even reach up to 38&percnt; on average.",

An effective and efficient quality management needs to be accurate to detect intolerable errors meanwhile light-weight in nature. However, it is difficult to design such a quality management satisfying both the two demands and existing work usually optimizes for one demand at the expense of the other. In this paper, we aim to achieve higher energy efficiency of quality management by optimizing detection accuracy and overhead simultaneously. We observe that the detection difficulty varies across inputs and there exists much redundant computation in detection process. Based on this observation, a cascaded quality management which can minimize the overhead and doesnu0027t lower detection accuracy is proposed. The proposed solution pays more proper computation effort according to different detection difficulties of inputs so as to avoid unnecessary energy consumption. Whatu0027s more, by exploring the design space sufficiently and effectively, we can assure the highest energy-efficiency of the proposed topology. The experiment results demonstrate that our approach can achieve much greater energy-efficiency than existing solutions.",

        "abstract": "In chip multiprocessors (CMPs), nonuniform cache architecture (NUCA) is often employed to organize last-level cache (LLC) banks through network-on-chip (NoC). Because of the shrinking feature size and unstable operating environment, severe reliability problems unavoidably emerge and cause frequent on-chip component (e.g., cores, cache banks, routers) failures. Typical fault-tolerant CMPs should possess the feature of graceful degradation and function normally with deactivated tiles. However, for CMPs adopting static NUCA, certain physical address areas will become inaccessible when cache banks in a CMP node are isolated from the system. To protect cache from such threats induced by either online or offline faults, we survey several potential solutions and propose the utility-driven node remapping technique by reusing the resources in NoC. In our NoC-assisted remapping scheme, cache accesses to isolated banks are so redirected that cache space contention are successfully balanced and relieved in shared-LLC, thus ensuring the least performance penalty caused by fault isolation. Our experimental results show significant performance improvement over conventional resizing approaches such as set reduction.",

Hence, itu0027s hard to provide one general and highly-efficient hardware solution to accommodate all of them, and it is also impractical for the domain-specific developers to customize their flown hardware targeting on a specific NN model. To deal with this dilemma, this study proposes a design automation tool, DeepBurning, allowing the application developers to build from scratch learning accelerators that targets their specific NN models with custom configurations and optimized performance. DeepBurning includes a RTL-level accelerator generator and a coordinated compiler that generates the control flow and data layout under the user-specified constraints. The results can be used to implement FPGA-based NN accelerator or help generate chip design for early design stage. In general, DeepBurning supports a large family of NN models, and greatly simplifies the design flow of NN accelerators for the machine learning or AI application developers. The evaluation shows that the generated learning accelerators burnt to our FPGA board exhibit great power efficiency compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based solutions.",

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of Near-Threshold Voltage(NTV) SRAM and Multi-Voltage Domain (Multi-VDD) for power reduction in large capacity cache. To prevent data corruption in cache, we propose redundancy-based data salvaging technique for fault recovery. To solve the dilemma of power reduction and reliability guarantee, we try to match vulnerable/invulnerable data sets to high/low voltage domains.

Distinguished from defect tolerance and fault tolerance, error tolerance is based on application characteristics and relaxes the constraint of 100 percent functional correctness. From the viewpoint of error tolerance, this paper proposes a framework across multiple layers for fault criticality evaluation. Furthermore, taking an H.264/AVC decoder as an example, fault injection experiments demonstrate that for different functional modules, the faults in them bear different fault criticalities because of their unbalanced effects on applications, the faults in the same module also have diverse fault criticalities. The information that which faults are most critical can aid in test for yield and design for cost-effective fault tolerance. Error control techniques can be used to suppress error propagation and make more faults acceptable.",

        "abstract": "As technology evolves, power dissipation has become a critical issue of VLSI circuit design. Lowering power supply voltage is an efficient method to reduce dynamic power. In order to maintain performance, the threshold voltage of a device should be reduced accordingly, which results in an exponential increase of static power. When entering into deep sub-micron (DSM) process era, leakage power becomes comparable with dynamic power consumption. Fast simulators are urgently needed just as are low leakage design technologies. Precise circuit simulators (such as HSPICE) can accurately account for leakage power estimation, but are only practical for small circuits. Firstly, in this paper, the stack effect of CMOS transistors and primitive logic gates is demonstrated based on which a leakage model of the simulator is put forward. And then experiments on ISCAS85 and ISCAS89 benchmark circuits are given to show that this simulator is hundredfold accelerated compared with HSPICE with endurable accuracy (error under 3%), and the memory explosion problem of accurate simulator is also solved in the same time.",

This paper presents a design space exploration method for the pipeline implementation of the deep CNN models, which concurrently optimizes parallelism and frequency to achieve a comprehensive optimization on throughput. In addition to the quantitative modeling on parallelism, the maximum achievable system frequency under various parallelism is explored to leverage the PVT-margins in real-life scenarios and is adopted to guide the design space exploration for further performance boost. A case study of the AlexNet model is implemented using the proposed method on the Altera DE5a-Net board. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the throughput up to 906.25GOP/s, which gains 1.39\u00d7 improvement compared to state-of-the-art RTL optimization methods.",

        "abstract": "As the feature size scales down, crosstalk noise on circuit timing becomes increasingly significant. In this paper, we propose a path delay test generation method toward activation of worst case crosstalk effects, in order to decrease the test escape of delay testing. The proposed method performs transition-map-based timing analysis to identify crosstalk-sensitive critical paths, followed by a deterministic test generation process. Using the transition map instead of the timing window to manage the timing information, the proposed method can identify many false coupling sites and thus reduce the pessimism in crosstalk-induced fault collection caused by inaccurate timing analysis. It can also efficiently calculate the accumulative crosstalk-induced delay, and find the sub-paths which cause worst case crosstalk effects during test generation. By converting the timing constraints of coupling lines into logic constraints, complex timing processing for crosstalk effect activation is avoided during test generation. In addition, the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency can be explored by varying the size of timescale used in the transition map.",

        "abstract": "As the feature size shrinks to the nanometer scale, SRAM-based FPGAs are increasingly vulnerable to soft errors. Checkpointing is an effective fault recovery technique that can restore the faulty system to its previous fault free state. Since the function of the system needs to be suspended during checkpoint saving and checkpoint restoring, so the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) of the system is critical to the system performance. In this work, we propose a hierarchical hardware checkpointing (HHC) technique that contains a high-speed on-chip checkpoint and a low-speed off-chip checkpoint to accelerate fault recovery for SRAM-based FPGAs. Most of single event effect (SEE) faults can be recovered by the high-speed on-chip checkpoint, which significantly reduces the MTTR of the system. The memory resource occupation of the on-chip checkpoint is low because HHC only stores the logic states of user bits and check information for configuration bits. Experimental results show that, compared with traditional off-chip checkpoint strategies, the proposed technique can reduce the MTTR of the system by 94.30%. In addition, the memory resource occupation is 11.11% of FPGAs, a little high but can be further optimized.",

        "abstract": "As an emerging non-volatile memory technology, phase change memory (PCM) is promising as an alternative for traditional memories such as DRAM. In spite of its non-volatility, high density, low standby power, and resilience to soft errors, PCM has a limited write endurance or lifetime, which means that each PCM cell can only be overwritten finite times. More importantly, limited lifetime potentially provides malicious attackers an opportunity to intentionally aggravate write traffic into PCM. In this paper, from the standpoint of attackers, we propose random stream attacks (RSAK) methods for phase change memory used in video applications. Experimental results show that compared to natural video sequences, RSAK incurs higher total write traffic or worsened lifetime. RSAK also gives hints on how to build a more secure PCM in video applications to counter malicious write streams.",

        "abstract": "With the increase of storage density, DRAM refresh leads to higher overhead of power and bandwidth, particularly in emerging 3D stacked memory design like Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC). To exploit the hardware resources for a smarter solution, we propose a data-aware refresh control scheme, Trial and Error (Trial-n-Error), which leverages the data-pattern dependence characteristics of the cells' retention time to reduce refresh operations. Trial-n-Error is a systematic approach that employs our proposed Synergy Testing to capture the refresh bottleneck of DRAM memory: \"weak\" cells that have a relatively shorter retention time. By locating the dominant weak cells sensitized by applications, Trial-n-Error can avoid the worst-case refresh setting, and adjust the refresh rate under the control of our self-tuning algorithm. Thus, Trial-n-Error can gradually approach to the possible lower-bound of refresh rate for less energy and memory bandwidth consumption. In experiments of 3D-stacked DRAMs, we successfully eliminate an average of 28% refresh operations and save 21% refresh energy for a set of pre-profiled synthetic data patterns and real benchmarks.\n\n",

The non-leaky pulse-coupled oscillator model uses a linear dynamic function to describe each oscillator's state changing, so it can avoid the problem of large computational complexity induced by the non-linear dynamic function the classical pulse-coupled oscillator model uses. Therefore, the algorithm can be efficiently implemented on a WSN node. This paper proves that the proposed algorithm can achieve the synchronization, describes the details of the algorithm, analyzes how to implement the algorithm on a WSN node, discusses the influences of the model's parameters on the synchronization, and introduces the refractory period to eliminate the infinite firing loop problem. The feasibility and the effectiveness of the algorithm were tested and verified by experiment.",

        "abstract": "Multilevel spin toque transfer RAM (STT-RAM) is a suitable storage device for energy-efficient neural network accelerators (NNAs), which relies on large-capacity on-chip memory to support brain-inspired large-scale learning models from conventional artificial neural networks to current popular deep convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the application of multilevel STT-RAM to general-purpose NNAs. First, the error-resilience feature of neural networks is leveraged to tolerate the read/write reliability issue in multilevel cell STT-RAM using approximate computing. The induced read/write failures at the expense of higher storage density can be effectively masked by a wide spectrum of NN applications with intrinsic forgiveness. Second, we present a precision-tunable STT-RAM buffer for the popular general-purpose NNA. The targeted STT-RAM memory design is able to transform between multiple working modes and adaptable to meet the varying quality constraint of approximate applications. Lastly, the reconfigurable STT-RAM buffer not only enables precision scaling in NNA but also provides adaptiveness to the demand for different learning models with distinct working-set sizes. Particularly, we demonstrate the concept of capacity/precision-tunable STT-RAM memory with the emerging reconfigurable deep NNA and elaborate on the data mapping and storage mode switching policy in STT-RAM memory to achieve the best energy efficiency of approximate computing.",

First, for delay-fault test pattern sets of ISCAS89 benchmarks, this algorithm can cut down 37.5% or more test power than the simulation-based annealing algorithm. Second, because approaches which use the Hamming distance between two input test patterns, to optimize the test power, cannot reduce as much power for ISCAS85 benchmarks as expected, a novel optimization approach that uses the power of an ideal circuit without delay, to optimize the test power is presented. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can cut down 70.8% more test power than present approaches. Third, the influence of undetermined test bits on test power optimization is studied by changing the number of undetermined bits in test patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that with the increase of undetermined test bits, the un-optimized test power markedly decreases.",

In this paper, a novel WSN-oriented low-power processor (WO-LPP) design scheme is presented. Our processor has an 8-bit simple 3-stage pipeline event-driven RISC ISA core and 4k SRAM, 64K on-chip program flash connected by Harvard bus. At the same time, on-chip event-based task management, on-chip hardware management and power management scheme are coordinately designed with some general peripheral devices, such as time counter, real time counter, ADC, SPI, I2C and UART interface to meet most application requirements of wireless sensor networks.

To prevent attackers from controlling and observing the data of scan cells, this paper proposes a novel Bias Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) based secure scan chain design. The Bias PUF, which is driven by low speed clock and produces response bit 1 in rare challenges, is proposed. For attackers, without right challenges, data cannot be shifted in or shifted out from scan chain. Moreover, to reduce the negative effect on test time, multiplexers are designed to control the data flow along the scan chain. Experimental results and analysis show that, the proposed scan chain design can resist existing attacks without sacrificing the testability. In comparison with previous works, the hardware overhead is less and the test time is shorter.",

Existing protection strategies based on fixed memory bandwidth assignment degrade processor performance and severely harm the experience of cloud-users. This paper proposes a novel light-weight timing channel protection scheme against both side channel and covert channel attacks to the shared memory controllers of cloud Chip Multi-Processors (CMPs). Instead of enforcing a fixed time-slot assignment to the applications, we go an entirely different technical route and utilize the background DRAM refresh as a free noise source to eliminate the time correlation between victim and attacker applications. The proposed protection framework, MemJam, relies on emerging Fine-Grained Refresh technology to achieve the effects of timing channel obfuscation. Multi-programmed workloads running in a cloud CMP were used to evaluate the protection method. The results show that the light-weight refresh-based noise can effectively block the timing-channel between user applications, and achieve up to $1. 69sim 3mathrm {X}$ memory performance boost compared to prior solutions.",

However, due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the on-chip traffic, one critical problem is that the NoC power consumption cannot effectively adapt to the variation of its traffic intensity, also known as localized power adaptation, hence yielding a suboptimal power efficiency. Prior approaches either resort to the over-provisioned NoC design or coarse-grained bandwidth scaling to partially alleviate excessive power consumption brought by the traffic temporal or spatial heterogeneity. While in this paper, we propose a novel NoC architecture called Shuttle NoC (ShuttleNoC) to address this challenge. It leverages the link reconfiguration to enable flexible packet traversing between multiple subnetworks, and specialized punch lines to accelerate latency sensitive traffic. With the support of the dedicated power adaptation mechanisms, it is shown in the evaluation that the proposed ShuttleNoC architecture could effectively tackle the power and performance tradeoff and significantly boost the power efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "Refresh operations consume substantial energy and bandwidth in high-density dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) memory. The trend of increasing refresh overhead limits the scalability of DRAM memory that refreshes all cells at the same rate, because the refresh rate setting depends on the worst-case weak cell manufactured in unstable process technology. To cope with this issue, fine-grained refresh (FGR) is proposed to eliminate the unnecessary refresh operations caused by minor weak cells. Even JEDEC\u2019s DDR4 DRAM specification announces the support of FGR, which is likely to evolve and become a standard in future DRAM. Unfortunately, according to our key observation, the effectiveness of FGR is greatly confined by the procedure of refresh-oblivious device integration because all memory devices within a module have to be controlled and refreshed in a lockstep way after the step of assembly. In this paper, we are the first to propose a holistic FGR-oriented DRAM optimization framework, retention-aware DRAM assembly and repair (RADAR), to enhance the effectiveness of FGR in DRAM modules. RADAR includes two novel techniques applicable at the stage of DRAM assembly. The first one is retention-aware device clustering that integrates the \u201ccompatible\u201d devices to achieve low refresh rate through a preassembly testing and retention-aware matching method. The second technique, Microfix, exploits the hierarchical DRAM array structure and its redundancy to fix critical weak DRAM rows through fine-grained row and subarray remapping. With this optimization architecture, RADAR, the refresh overhead of DRAM dual in-line memory modules can be dramatically reduced as implied in the experiments.",

        "abstract": "Hardware Trojan has attracted more and more attention from academia and industry because of its significant potential threat. Long activation time is a major concern during Trojan detection process. Traditional pre-silicon verification and post-silicon testing cannot be extended to detect hardware Trojans efficiently because Trojan is usually activated under specific rare conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to expose Trojans efficiently by increasing the transition activities of ASIC logic regions hard to reach. Specifically, the proposed approach detects the local regions with low reachability by calculating signals statistical correlation, and detect the local regions with low reachability. In addition, by analyzing the global correlations between primary inputs and these rare regions, a retrospective test stimulus generation algorithm is developed to better control the internal logic alteration. Besides, we propose an output sequence model based on CRC check. The experiment results show that the Trojan activation time can be significantly decreased and the Trojans being exposed can be increased dramatically with the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The shared memory controllers of single-chip cloud computing (SCC) processors are vulnerable to timing-channel attacks. Existing protection strategies based on fixed memory bandwidth assignment degrade processor performance and severely harm the experience of cloud-users. This paper proposes a novel light-weight timing channel protection scheme against both side channel and covert channel attacks to the shared memory controllers of cloud chip multi-processors (CMPs). Instead of enforcing a fixed time-slot assignment to the applications, we go an entirely different technical route and utilize the background DRAM refresh as a free noise source to eliminate the time correlation between victim and attacker applications. The proposed protection framework, MemJam, relies on the emerging fine-grained refresh technology to achieve the effects of timing channel obfuscation. Multi-programmed workloads running in a cloud CMP were used to evaluate the protection method. The results show that the light-weight refresh-based noise can effectively block the timing-channel between user applications, and achieve up to 1.61~2.49X memory performance boost compared to prior solutions.",

        "abstract": "Pre-Silicon hardware Trojan detection has been studied for years. The most popular benchmark circuits are from the Trust-Hub. Their common feature is that the probability of activating hardware Trojans is very low. This leads to a series of machine learning based hardware Trojan detection methods which try to find the nets with low signal probability of 0 or 1. On the other hand, it is considered that, if the probability of activating hardware Trojans is high, these hardware Trojans can be easily found through behaviour simulations or during functional test. This paper explores the grey zone between these two opposite scenarios: if the activation probability of a hardware Trojan is not low enough for machine learning to detect it and is not high enough for behaviour simulation or functional test to find it, it can escape from detection. Experiments show the existence of such hardware Trojans, and this paper suggests a new set of hardware Trojan benchmark circuits for future study.",

As the simulation data is inherently incomplete, the quality of mined assertions is to be measured. In this paper, we propose a Belief-failRate framework to evaluate the success possibility of mined assertions, by taking both occurrences of free variable assignments and conflicts of absent scenarios into consideration. Meanwhile, a success possibility guided assertion constraining method is given to improve the quality of generated assertions. Experimental results show that assertions with high ranking using the proposed Belief-failRate framework are likely to have high possibility to be true assertions.

        "abstract": "Unlike radio communication in terrestrial wireless sensor networks, acoustic channel in underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) is challenged by long propagation delay and swarm mobility. The long propagation delay causes the deterioration of network throughput and unfairness. Moreover, the swarm mobility causes unreliable access and the failure of channel reservation. In this paper, we propose a novel delay tolerant MAC protocol (DTMAC) inspired by the coupon collector\u2019s problem. It proposes a distributed coupon collection algorithm in UWSNs. If a node needs to send a packet, the packet will be repeatedly transmitted    $m$    times, with a transmission probability to be    $p$   . Under the traditional protocol interference model, we first set up a probability model for throughput of DTMAC, and then give the throughput-optimal value for    $m$    and    $p$    with the successful transmission probability as tuning parameter. Because no any acknowledge or channel reservation is used, the throughput of DTMAC is not influenced by propagation delay. In addition, space unfairness problem also no longer exists since DTMAC is not concerned with transmission distance. The simulation results show that the throughput of DTMAC greatly outperforms that of MAC protocol with RTS/CTS scheme in most underwater scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Trace signal selection is of great importance for post-silicon debug. Debuggers traditionally use state restoration to improve the observability of the trace data, and state restoration ratio (SRR) is computed after state restoration. In this paper, we exploit the combination of snapshot states and trace states to improve the observability. First, we propose a novel state restoration method, called cluster restoration. It uses both the snapshot states of flip-flop clusters at the beginning of tracing, and the tracing states of the clusters\u2019 inputs during the tracing window to deterministically restore all states of these clusters during the tracing window. We also present a cluster restoration-based trace signal selection method to select clusters instead of trace signals directly, which includes two stages: 1) cluster generation and 2) cluster evaluation. For cluster generation, feedback loop-based cluster generation and backward tracing-based cluster generation techniques are proposed. For cluster evaluation, a new metric, called the global state restoration improvement is proposed to evaluate the candidate clusters. The experimental results show that in comparison to prior trace signal selection methods, our method can improve the SRR and reduce the runtime of trace signal selection as well.",

        "abstract": "Test compression has drawn significant attention of academies and industries recently, since it can reduce test data volume and test application time of integrated circuits without losing fault coverage, thus diminishing the gap between the test and manufacture camps. Based on test stimulus and test response, the test compression techniques can be classified to two categories; test stimulus compression and test response compaction. This thesis conducts the research on both fields and presents several compression methods. The contributions of the thesis include: (1)This thesis presents a Variable-Tail code, and shows how to use this code to compress the test stimulus. Variable-Tail code is a variable-length-to-variable-length code. It can achieve higher test compression ratio in the case of high X-bit density. The experimental results show that the compression ratio of Variable-Tail with the proposed reordering algorithm is close to the theoretical upper bound of predictive codes (the average distance is only about 1.26%), while up to 20% of test power is saved. (2) This thesis presents the parallel core wrapper design. Studying on the distributions of X-bit, we find the phenomenon of full overlapping and partial overlapping of scan slices. When the slices overlap continuously, they can be loaded only once, thus test application time and test power are significantly saved. The experimental results show when the parallel core wrapper design is applied, compared with the serial core wrapper design, the test application time is reduced to 2/3 and test power is reduced to 1/15. (3)The 3X compression architecture is the main contribution of this thesis. The 3X architecture consists of three parts: X-Config stimulus compression, X-Balance test generation and X-Tolerant response compaction. X-Config stimulus decompression uses a periodically alterable MUXs network. X-Balance test generation considers the dynamic compaction, compression, scan chain design and periodically alterable MUXs network as a whole. It applies two algorithms: one is the backward patterns remove algorithm and the other one is the specified bits based scan chain design algorithm. X-Tolerant response compaction uses a single-output compactor based on convolutional code. Since only one output pin is needed, X-Tolerant response compaction guarantees the highest compaction ratio. In order to achieve the X-Tolerant capacity, a multiple-weights basic check matrix generation algorithm is presented.",

In this paper, we take into account the unique data aggregation communication paradigm of wireless sensor networks: the network performance can be measured by exploiting whether application data from various sensor nodes reach the sink, without incurring any additional overhead of active probes or performance reports. Then we present a novel algorithm, which can infer sensor network topology and link loss performance simultaneously. Finally, we validate the algorithm through simulations and it exhibit ts good performance and scalability.",

In this work, a novel electrochemical catalyst of cobalt-based carbon nanofibers with incorporated nitrogen prepared by electrospinning technique has been introduced as an efficient Pt-free counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells for the first time. By introducing cobalt and nitrogen in the carbon nanofibers network, the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrode is improved. The dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using cobalt-based carbon nanofibers with incorporated nitrogen composite as counter electrode exhibit a high power conversion efficiency of 9.05% measured at 100\u2009mW cm \u20132  illumination, which is significantly higher than that of the most commonly used but expensive Pt counterpart (7.1%). The present work highlights that cobalt-based carbon nanofibers with incorporated nitrogen composite is a suitable alternative counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Rational design of nanostructured metal oxides with carbon substrates is urgently needed to improve the electrochemical properties of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this paper, the preparation of one-dimensional (1D) metal-organic frameworks grown on polymer(Co/Ni) fiber films via a feasible electrospinning method and in situ growth strategy is reported. After successive carbonization and oxidation heat-treatments, hierarchical heteroatom-doped carbon nanofibers decorated with several nanocomposites (denoted as NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO/carbon nanofibers) were obtained. When their electrochemical properties were evaluated by testing Na half-cells, the resultant sample displayed a high sodium-storage capacity of 210\u202fmAh\u202fg \u22121  after 200 cycles at a current density of 100\u202fmA\u202fg \u22121  and an outstanding rate capability. The enhancement of the sodium-storage performance of NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO/carbon nanofibers was ascribed to the novel structure and the synergistic effect between Co/Ni-Oxide and carbon component. The 1D carbonized nanofibers are well intertwined to form a three-dimensional conductive matrix with heterogeneous particles embedded, which can effectively reduce the ionic diffusion distance and ensure high electronic mobility along their 1D geometry, leading to rapid diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, well-dispersed heterogeneous particles endow the composite high surface to exposure to the electrolyte, which can contribute to a high utilization rate.",

The W2C/MC composite possesses remarkable electrochemical properties for both novel organic disulfide/thiolate and conventional triiodide/iodide redox couples, with a performance that surpasses those of W2C and MC separate components. Thus, the iodide electrolyte based-DSCs involving W2C/MC as a flexible CE shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 7.61%. Remarkably, the W2C/MC composite is also found to be suitable as a CE for organic sulfide redox couple electrolyte based-DSCs, showing a much higher PCE (5.96%) as compared to their separate W2C and MC component counterparts (5.08 and 4.38%, respectively).",

        "abstract": "Herein, an approach is reported for fabrication of Co-N -embedded 1D porous carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with graphitic carbon-encased Co nanoparticles originated from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which is further explored as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Electrochemical results reveal that the electrocatalyst prepared by pyrolysis at 1000 \u00b0C (CoNC-CNF-1000) exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward ORR that favors the four-electron ORR process and outstanding long-term stability with 86% current retention after 40 000 s. Meanwhile, it also shows superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER, reaching a lower potential of 1.68 V at 10 mA cm and a potential gap of 0.88 V between the OER potential (at 10 mA cm ) and the ORR half-wave potential. The ORR and OER performance of CoNC-CNF-1000 have outperformed commercial Pt/C and most nonprecious-metal catalysts reported to date. The remarkable ORR and OER catalytic performance can be mainly attributable to the unique 1D structure, such as higher graphitization degree beneficial for electronic mobility, hierarchical porosity facilitating the mass transport, and highly dispersed CoN C active sites functionalized carbon framework. This strategy will shed light on the development of other MOF-based carbon nanofibers for energy storage and electrochemical devices.",

        "abstract": "To improve the catalytic activity of Nb2O5, a composite Nb2O5/C (Nb2O5 imbedded in carbon support) is synthesized with a simple in situ method and then introduced the composite into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) as a counter electrode (CE) catalyst. Based on the analysis of the cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Tafel-polarization curve measurements, the catalytic activity of the Nb2O5/C composite for the regeneration of iodide-free redox couples of polysulfide (T-2/T-) and cobalt complex (Co3+/2+) is indeed enhanced significantly as compared with pure Nb2O5, because the composite electrode eliminates the particle aggregation and forms a mesoporous network structure with large pore size. The T-2/T- electrolyte based DSCs with Nb2O5/C CE yields a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.11%, generating a great improvement of 63.8% as compared to the Pt CE based DSCs. In addition, the Nb2O5/C exhibits higher catalytic activity than Pt for regenerating the Co3+/2+ redox couple and the DSCs using Nb2O5/C CE shows a high PCE of 9.86%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

MoO 2 /carbon nanofiber composites (MoO 2 /CNs) were successfully prepared via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The obtained MoO 2 /carbon electrode showed good chemical stability, lower charge transfer resistance and higher electrocatalytic activity as compared to the conventional Pt electrodes. The characteristics of DSSCs based on MoO 2 /CNs electrodes were analyzed using photocurrent density-voltage, cyclic voltammetry, Tafel polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The experimental results revealed that the MoO 2 /CNs electrodes exhibited the optimal electrode characteristics. The DSSCs based on MoO 2 /CNs electrodes displayed better photovoltaic conversion efficiency (7.6%) than the Pt counter electrodes (7.34%).",

For the I 3  \u2212 /I \u2212  redox couple, the CMS shows a relatively lower catalytic behavior than Pt due to large charge transfer resistance and low mass transport rate. Toward the organic T 2 /T \u2212  redox couple, the CMS is a much better catalyst than Pt, and the DSCs exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.30%, which is a great enhancement of 42.09% over the Pt CE based DSCs. Cyclic voltammograms depict that CMS displays a high peak current density and a low peak-to-peak separation, indicating a high catalytic activity of CMS toward T 2 /T \u2212  redox couple. For the Co 3+/2+  redox couple, CMS presents a competitive catalytic activity relative to Pt and the DSCs shows a PCE of 8.73%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The recent stunning rise in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) has triggered much attention. However, achieving high PCE values are quite challenging because the ternary system is complicated on phase separation behavior. In this work, ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) with one acceptor (PC 71 BM) and two donors, i.e., one polymer (PTB7-Th) and one small molecule (DR3TBDTT) have been fabricated. We substantially improved PCE from the best reported value of 7.53%\u20139.25% with increase of 22.8%, and an averaged PCE of 9.25% is obtained due to the improvement of the fill factor (FF) and the short-circuit current density (J sc ). The results of atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicate that a highly ordered molecular compatibility could be obtained by forming alloy with two miscible donors, and the doping of DR3TBDTT not only protects the long distance charge transport in the original binary system, but also improves the size of phase separation of the active layer within the ternary OSCs, thus forming the ordered nano morphology, which can improve the mobility of hole and reduce the charge recombination.",

A PCE of 8.95% was achieved for polymer solar cells (PSCs) with 15 wt% C6H4BrNO2, which is an 18% enhancement in PCE compared with binary OSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM.

By comparing and analyzing the effects of the use of different additives on the film-forming performances, DIO was selected as the optimal additive. The optimal additive amount of DIO could contribute to a more uniform and non-defective growth of perovskite crystal nucleation, enabling preparation of the smooth and compact film with large grain size. The effect mechanism of the chelation between DIO and Pb 2+  on the film-forming process of perovskite crystal was also analyzed. The PCE of the PSC device incorporating the DIO is runned up to 19.1%, accounting for a 73.6% enhancement as compared to pre-optimized control PSCs. Conclusively, using the proposed technology, the conversion efficiency of the prepared 5\u00a0cm\u00d75\u00a0cm device reaches up to 11.2%, which can be applicable to the preparation of large-area perovskite solar cells.",

A transition from type-I to type-II band alignment is observed for the QRs via photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. While x \u2264 0.45, the QR PL spectra show a blue-shift and an increasing intensity with increasing Al-composition, revealing the enhancement of quantum confinement in the QRs with type-I band alignment. While x \u2265 0.60, the characteristic large blue-shift with excitation intensity and the much longer lifetime indicate the realization of a type-II band alignment. Due to the height fluctuation of QR structures grown by droplet epitaxy mode, it is not the large blue-shift of emission energy, but the long lifetime that becomes the more important feature to identify the type-II band alignment.",

        "title": "18.0% efficiency flexible perovskite solar cells based on double hole transport layers and CH3NH3PbI3\u2212xClx with dual additives",
        "abstract": "The performance of flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is largely lower than that of their glass/ITO counterparts. This is mainly due to the fact that the surface of PET/ITO is rougher than glass/ITO. ITO bulges could cause the upper perovskite crystals to deteriorate, eventually leading to a large leakage current and the low performance of devices. We reduce the leakage current of PET/ITO assembled PSCs by two measures to improve the PCE of the flexible PSCs. First, double hole transport layers of PEDOT:PSS/NiO are deposited on the surface of PET/ITO, that is, a layer of PEDOT:PSS film is first spin-coated on the ITO surface and then a layer of NiO film is evaporated above to cover the small bulges on the bare ITO. Second, the dual additives of DIO and H2O were introduced to the perovskite precursor solution to control the process of crystal formation and grain growth of the perovskite absorber, finally improving the uniformity and sizes of the perovskite crystals. In conclusion, the double hole transport layers and CH3NH3PbI3\u2212xClx perovskites with dual additives produced a perovskite film with low roughness, high uniformity and large crystal grains on PET/ITO, finally achieving flexible PSCs with the best PCE of 18.0% and excellent flexibility. Our approach provides an effective pathway to fabricate highly efficient and large-scale flexible PSCs.",

The PL excitation and time-resolved PL spectra reveal an efficient carrier relaxation from the AlGaAs barrier into the InAlAs QD ground state via the continuum states. The temperature dependence of the PL spectra shows a decreasing PL linewidth and a strong redshift of the peak energy at low temperature, indicating that carriers are redistributed through the continuum states by thermal activation and lateral transfer.",

Herein, the Fe 2 O 3 /CNFs composites are synthesized by electrospin method and a facile hydrothermal method, and the composites of Fe 2 O 3 /CNFs is used as a low-cost counter electrode for DSSCs. Scanning electron microscopy measurement shows that Fe 2 O 3  nanoparticles have been evenly located on the exterior of CNFs, providing abundant catalytic active sites for triiodide reduction. The one dimensional CNFs has a high conductivity, which could effectively reduce the agglomeration of Fe 2 O 3  nanoparticles, thus increasing the specific surface area of the material and facilitating the rapid transmission of ions and electrons in the electrolyte. The synergistic effect of Fe 2 O 3 /CNFs composite leads to high electrocatalytic activity. Consequently, DSSCs devices constructed with an Fe 2 O 3 /CNFs composite based on CE afford a decent power conversion efficiency of 7.48%, higher than the expensive Pt CE based DSSCs (6.97%).",

        "abstract": "Fewer than 30% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are eligible to receive curative therapies, and so a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HCC is needed to identify potential therapeutic targets. The role of microRNA (miRNA) in modulating tumour progression has been demonstrated, and therapies targeting miRNA appear promising. miR-204-5p has been shown to function in numerous types of cancer, but its role in HCC remains unclear. In this study, we found that miR-204-5p expression was downregulated in cancerous HCC tissues compared to nontumour tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis also showed that low expression of miR-204-5p predicted worse outcomes of HCC patients. In addition, miR-204-5p expression was significantly lower in HCC cell lines. The function of miR-204-5p was also assessed both  and . We demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-204-5p in HCC cell lines inhibited HCC cell proliferation and clonogenicity using CCK8, BrdU and colony-forming assays, while the inhibition of miR-204-5p enhanced proliferation and clonogenicity. Further  studies in mice further confirmed the proliferation capacity of miR-204-5p. We also identified sine oculis homeobox homologue 1 () as a direct target of miR-204-5p and showed that it was inversely correlated with miR-204-5p in both human and mouse HCC tissues. Transfection of miR-204-5p mimics in BEL-7404 cells blocked the cell cycle by inhibiting the expression of cyclin-D1 and cyclin-A1, cell cycle-related factors regulated by SIX1. More importantly, overexpression of the 3'UTR mutant  but not the wild-type  abolished the suppressive effect of miR-204-5p, and downregulated SIX1 in BEL-7402 cells that transfected with miR-204 inhibitors could partly block the inhibitory effect of miR-204-5p on proliferation. Thus, we have demonstrated that miR-204-5p suppresses HCC proliferation by directly regulating SIX1 and its downstream factors.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) significantly restricts the clinical efficacy of gastric cancer (GC) chemotherapy, and it is critical to search novel targets to predict and overcome MDR. Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) has been proved to be correlated with drug resistance in several cancers. The present study revealed that LRIG1 was overexpressed in chemo-sensitive GC tissues and decreased expression of LRIG1 predicted poor survival in GC patients. We observed that up-regulation of LRIG1 enhanced chemo-sensitivity in GC cells. Interestingly, miR-20a, which was overexpressed in GC MDR cell lines and tissues, was identified to regulate LRIG1 expression by directly targeting its 3'untranslated region. We also found that inhibition of miR-20a suppressed GC MDR, and up-regulation showed opposite effects. Moreover, we demonstrated that the miR-20a/LRIG1 axis regulated GC cell MDR through EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mediated PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. Finally, LRIG1 expression in human GC tissues is inversely correlated with miR-20a and EGFR. Taken together, the newly identified miR-20a/LRIG1/EGFR link provides insight into the MDR process of GC, and targeting this axis represents a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block GC chemo-resistance.

        "abstract": "The clinical application of GX1, an optimal gastric cancer (GC) targeting peptide, is greatly limited because its receptor in the GC vasculature is unknown. In this study, we screened the candidate receptor of GX1, transglutaminase-2(TGM2), by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) combined with mass spectrometry. We found that TGM2 was up-regulated in GC vascular endothelial cells and that GX1 receptor expression was suppressed correspondingly after TGM2 downregulation. A highly consistent co-localization of GX1 receptor and TGM2 was detected at both the cellular and tissue levels. High TGM2 expression was evident in GC tissues from patients with poor prognosis. After TGM2 downregulation, the GX1-mediated inhibition of proliferation and migration and the induction of the apoptosis of GC vascular endothelial cells were weakened or even reversed. Finally, we observed that GX1 could inhibit the GTP-binding activity of TGM2 by reducing its intracellular distribution and downregulating its downstream molecular targets (nuclear factor-kappa B, NF-\u03baB; hypoxia-inducible factor 1-\u03b1, HIF1\u03b1) in GC vascular endothelial cells. Our study confirms that peptide GX1 can inhibit angiogenesis by directly binding to TGM2, subsequently reducing the GTP-binding activity of TGM2 and thereby suppressing its downstream pathway(NF-\u03baB/HIF1\u03b1). Our conclusions suggest that GX1/TGM2 may provide a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of GC.",

        "abstract": "Advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and the 5-year survival rate of patients with metastasis is extremely low. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered essential for metastatic CRC, but the fundamental molecular basis underlying this effect remains unknown. Here, we identified that O-GlcNAcylation, a unique posttranslational modification (PTM) involved in cancer metabolic reprogramming, increased the metastatic capability of CRC. The levels of O-GlcNAcylation were increased in the metastatic CRC tissues and cell lines, which likely promoted the EMT by enhancing EZH2 protein stability and function. The CRC patients with higher levels of O-GlcNAcylation exhibited greater lymph node metastasis potential and lower overall survival. Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter assays revealed that both O-GlcNAcylation transferase (OGT) and EZH2 are posttranscriptionally inhibited by microRNA-101. In addition, O-GlcNAcylation and H3K27me3 modification in the miR-101 promoter region further inhibited the transcription of miR-101, resulting in the upregulation of OGT and EZH2 in metastatic CRC, thus forming a vicious cycle. In this study, we demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation, which is negatively regulated by microRNA-101, likely promotes CRC metastasis by enhancing EZH2 protein stability and function. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation may be a potential therapeutic strategy for metastatic CRC.",

        "abstract": "Enabled homolog (Enah), which is a member of the Ena/VASP family that also includes VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) and Ena/VASP like, is a mammalian ortholog of Drosophila Enabled (Ena). An increasing number of studies demonstrated Enah overexpression is involved in human colorectal carcinomas, breast cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the significance of Enah expression in gastric cancer (GC) is poorly elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that Enah is upregulated in GC and associated with AJCC stage, depth of invasion and poor overall survival (OS). Knockdown of Enah inhibited GC cell proliferation and metastasis and vice versa. Further experiments suggested that p-Erk1/2, p-AKT, p-p65, Vimentin and Fibronectin were downregulated and E-cadherin was upregulated after Enah silencing, implicating altered functions in GC proliferation and metastasis. Thus, our study suggests that Enah is a harmful factor for GC and a novel target for GC treatment.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) significantly restricts the clinical efficacy of gastric cancer (GC) chemotherapy, and it is critical to search novel targets to predict and overcome MDR. Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) has been proved to be correlated with drug resistance in several cancers. The present study revealed that LRIG1 was overexpressed in chemo-sensitive GC tissues and decreased expression of LRIG1 predicted poor survival in GC patients. We observed that up-regulation of LRIG1 enhanced chemo-sensitivity in GC cells. Interestingly, miR-20a, which was overexpressed in GC MDR cell lines and tissues, was identified to regulate LRIG1 expression by directly targeting its 3'untranslated region. We also found that inhibition of miR-20a suppressed GC MDR, and up-regulation showed opposite effects. Moreover, we demonstrated that the miR-20a/LRIG1 axis regulated GC cell MDR through EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mediated PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. Finally, LRIG1 expression in human GC tissues is inversely correlated with miR-20a and EGFR. Taken together, the newly identified miR-20a/LRIG1/EGFR link provides insight into the MDR process of GC, and targeting this axis represents a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block GC chemo-resistance.

        "abstract": " Chemoresistance is the main cause of treatment failure in cancer and is associated with distant metastases and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study was aimed to explore the mechanism of metastases and EMT in chemoresistant gastric cancer. A key molecular pathway was identified via gene profiling and a bioinformatic analysis in a chemoresistant gastric cancer model. The roles of FOXL2, HMGA2, and ITGA2 were validated via loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments  and in an orthotopic gastric cancer animal model. The regulation of FOXL2 by HMGA2 was explored via immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays. The expression of these proteins in gastric cancer tissues was examined by IHC. HMGA2 and FOXL2 directly regulated the metastasis and EMT of chemoresistant gastric cancer. The interaction between HMGA2 and pRb facilitated the transactivation of FOXL2 by E2F1, and ITGA2 was the downstream effector of the HMGA2-FOXL2 pathway. HMGA2, FOXL2, and ITGA2 were associated with the TNM classification and staging of gastric cancer and were increased in metastatic lymph nodes and distant metastases. Increased HMGA2, FOXL2, and ITGA2 levels were associated with reduced overall survival periods of patients with gastric cancer. This study demonstrated that the transactivation of FOXL2 driven by interactions between HMGA2 and pRb might exert critical effects on the metastases and EMT of chemoresistant gastric cancer. Blocking the HMGA2-FOXL2-ITGA2 pathway could serve as a new strategy for gastric cancer treatment. .",

        "abstract": "Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common causes of cancer death worldwide; however, the molecular mechanism underlying CRC metastasis remains unknown. Using an integrated approach, we identified forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) as a novel regulator of CRC metastasis. Elevated expression of FOXC1 is significantly correlated with metastasis, recurrence and reduced survival. FOXC1 overexpression promotes CRC invasion and lung metastasis, whereas FOXC1 knockdown has the opposite effect. In addition, FOXC1 directly binds its target genes integrin \u03b17 (ITGA7) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and activates their expression. Genetic epistasis analysis confirmed that ITGA7 and FGFR4 act downstream of FOXC1. Furthermore, pharmaceutical inhibition of FGFR4 can reverse CRC metastasis mediated by FOXC1 overexpression. These results suggest that FOXC1 is a prognostic biomarker in CRC patients and targeting the FGFR4 signaling pathway may provide a promising strategy for the treatment of FOXC1-driven CRC metastasis.",

        "abstract": "O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is the only enzyme in mammals that catalyzes the attachment of \u03b2-D-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to serine or threonine residues of target proteins. Hyper-O-GlcNAcylation is becoming increasingly realized as a general feature of cancer and contributes to rapid proliferation of cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated that O-GlcNAc and OGT levels were increased in all six gastric cancer (GC) cell lines as compared with immortal gastric epithelial cells. Downregulation of the O-GlcNAcylation level by silencing OGT inhibited cell viability and growth rate via the cdk-2, cyclin D1 and ERK 1/2 pathways. In vivo xenograft assays also demonstrated that the hyper-O-GlcNAc level markedly promoted the proliferation of tumors. Moreover, compared with noncancerous tissues, the O-GlcNAcylation level was increased in cancerous tissues. GC patients with higher levels of O-GlcNAcylation exhibited large tumor sizes (\u22655 cm), deep tumor invasion (T3 and T4), high AJCC stages (stage III and IV), more lymph node metastases and lower overall survival. Notably, the phosphorylation level of ERK 1/2 was increased progressively with the increase of O-GlcNAcylation in both SGC 7901 and AGS cells. Consistently, human GC tissue arrays also revealed that ERK 1/2 signaling was positively correlated to O-GlcNAcylation (r = 0.348; P = 0.015). Taken together, here we reported that hyper-O-GlcNAcylation significantly promotes GC cells proliferation by modulating cell cycle related proteins and ERK 1/2 signaling, suggesting that inhibition of OGT may be a potential novel therapeutic target of GC.",

        "abstract": ": Metastasis is the major reason for high recurrence rates and poor survival among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying molecular mechanism of CRC metastasis is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of forkhead box K2 (FOXK2), one of the most markedly increased FOX genes in CRC, and the mechanism by which it is deregulated in CRC metastasis. : FOXK2 levels were analyzed in two independent human CRC cohorts (cohort I, n = 363; cohort II, n = 390).  Transwell assays and  lung and liver metastasis models were used to examine CRC cell migration, invasion and metastasis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were used to measure the binding of transcription factors to the promoters of FOXK2, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Cetuximab was utilized to treat FOXK2-mediated metastatic CRC. : FOXK2 was significantly upregulated in human CRC tissues, was correlated with more aggressive features and indicated a poor prognosis. FOXK2 overexpression promoted CRC migration, invasion and metastasis, while FOXK2 downregulation had the opposite effects. ZEB1 and EGFR were determined to be direct transcriptional targets of FOXK2 and were essential for FOXK2-mediated CRC metastasis. Moreover, activation of EGFR signaling by EGF enhanced FOXK2 expression via the extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathways. The EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab significantly inhibited FOXK2-promoted CRC metastasis. In clinical CRC tissues, FOXK2 expression was positively correlated with the expression of p65, ZEB1 and EGFR. CRC patients who coexpressed p65/FOXK2, FOXK2/ZEB1 and FOXK2/EGFR had poorer prognosis. : FOXK2 serves as a prognostic biomarker in CRC. Cetuximab can block the EGF-NF-\u03baB-FOXK2-EGFR feedback loop and suppress CRC metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In virtue of their fantastic sensing performance, heterojunction-based gas sensors has gained ascending attention and gradually become a new generation of high-performance gas sensors. However, due to the poor control on the element composition and distribution of heterostructure, it remains a great challenge to optimize and repeat the gas-sensing performance. In this paper, hollow p-CuO/n-ZnO nanofibers with controllable compositions were successfully synthesized by combining the electrospinning and atomic layer deposition (ALD) method, and the effect of compositions on the gas-sensing performance were systematically studied. The ratios of Zn to Cu (R Zn/Cu ) were well controlled by adjusting the amounts of raw materials and the deposition cycles of ALD in orthogonal experiments, which offers a good opportunity to optimize the gas sensing performances. Interestingly, with the increase of R Zn/Cu , the gas responses to 100\u2009ppm H 2 S at 250\u2009\u00b0C first increased to 60.5 (R Zn/Cu \u2009=\u200915.6) and then decreased gradually. The optimum response of these materials was improved about 6-fold versus the pure ZnO and 45-fold versus pure CuO. Meanwhile, the selectivity and stability of these H 2 S sensors were also got much optimized. The enhanced sensing performance is believed to be mainly attributed to the optimal ratio of p-CuO/n-ZnO and the mixed heterojunction with radial concentration gradient.",

        "abstract": "The heterojunction of g-C3N4/BiOI was uniformly immobilized on electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers via a facile in situ synthesis at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectra showed that both the C and N 1s peaks of PAN/g-C3N4/BiOI nanofibers shifted to higher binding energies as compared to those of PAN/g-C3N4 nanofibers suggesting electron transfer from g-C3N4 to BiOI during the formation of heterojunctions. The enhanced photocurrent densities and significant decrease in photoluminescence intensity confirmed the effective charge separation at the heterojunction interfaces in PAN/g-C3N4/BiOI nanofibers. The efficient separation of the electron\u2013hole pairs and their strong absorption in the visible region results in superior photocatalytic activities in the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) dyes and toxic Cr(VI) ions under visible-light irradiation versus PAN/g-C3N4 and PAN/BiOI nanofibers.

Notably, the Bi 2 WO 6 /ZnFe 2 O 4  heterostructures nanofibers could be easily separated from the solution under an external magnetic field by employing the ferromagnetic behaviors of ZnFe 2 O 4 . After several cycles, the photocatalytic activity of the Bi 2 WO 6 /ZnFe 2 O 4  heterostructures nanofibers did not decrease significantly suggesting that the Bi 2 WO 6 /ZnFe 2 O 4  heterostructures possess stable characteristics. This kind of Bi 2 WO 6 /ZnFe 2 O 4  heterostructures nanofibers with high visible-light photocatalytic activity, excellent stability and excellent recyclability could be significance in environmental application.",

The morphology and loading of Bi 2 MoO 6  nanosheets of Bi 2 MoO 6 /ZnFe 2 O 4  heterojunctions could be controlled by adjusting the concentration of molybdenum precursor during the solvothermal process. Comparative experiments revealed that the resulting Bi 2 MoO 6 /ZnFe 2 O 4  heterojunctions exhibit a higher visible light photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RB) than pure Bi 2 MoO 6  or ZnFe 2 O 4 . The photocurrent and PL measurements of the Bi 2 MoO 6 /ZnFe 2 O 4  heterojunctions also indicated an enhanced separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the heterojunctions could be easily recycled without a decrease in their photocatalytic activity due to their good magnetic separation performance and excellent chemical stability. Based on these findings, Bi 2 MoO 6 /ZnFe 2 O 4  heterojunctions are a promising visible-light-driven photocatalyst for converting solar energy to chemical energy for environmental remediation.",

The loading amount of BiMoO in the BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction nanofibers could be controlled by adjusting the precursor concentrations in the solvothermal process. The XPS analysis, energy band position calculation and trapping experiments all proved that the BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction is a Z-scheme heterojunction. The Z-scheme BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction had a much higher photocatalytic activity in the visible-light photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) than pure BiFeO nanofibers or pure BiMoO nanosheets. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the formation of Z-scheme BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunctions, which could be beneficial to the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction nanofibers could be easily separated under an external magnetic field via the ferromagnetic BiFeO. After several cycles, the photocatalytic activity of the BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction no longer significantly decreased suggesting that the BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction is stable.

Then, ZnO was deposited on the surface of PAN@PANI NFs by atomic layer deposition (ALD) to form PAN@PANI@ZnO NFs. The PANI and ZnO contents were well controlled by adjusting the polymerization time and the number of ALD cycles, respectively. The obtained PAN@PANI@ZnO NFs exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue under ultraviolet light irradiation than PAN@PANI and PAN@ZnO NFs, and the first-order degradation rate constant ( k  app ) of PAN@PANI@ZnO NFs formed with 400 ALD cycles was greater than that of PAN@ZnO NFs formed with 400 ALD cycles by a factor of 2.1. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is shown to originate from the improved charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes due to the formation of ZnO/PANI heterojunctions in PAN@PANI@ZnO NFs. The obtained PAN@PANI@ZnO photocatalysts are easily recycled with little decrease in photocatalytic activity because of their macroscopic mat structure and flexibility.",

However, spatial separation of charge carriers in traditional type II heterojunctions is at the expense of their redox ability. In this paper, well-designed direct Z-scheme systems (ZSS) of p-CuAlO/n-BiWO composite nanofibers with uniform non-woven web nanostructure was built by electrospinning technique and solvothermal reactions. The formation mechanism of the ZSS and the charge migration pathway is investigated in detail. Results show that as-prepared composite nanofibers exhibit desirable photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting due to its stronger redox power and efficient charge separation. Meantime, it shows great activity for photodegradation of various organic pollutant models (RhB, MO, 4-NP), which is 1 order of magnitude higher than the single-component CuAlO and BiWO. Furthermore, the composite nanofibers exhibit well separable properties by natural sedimentation because of its ultra-long and non-woven web nanostructure. The paper explores CuAlO and its Z-scheme heterostructures in water splitting for the first time, which may highlight its new applications.",

        "abstract": "P-type bismuth oxychloride (p-BiOCl) nanosheets were uniformly grown on n-type zinc ferrite (n-ZnFeO) electrospun nanofibers via a solvothermal technique to form hierarchical heterostructures of p-BiOCl/n-ZnFeO (p-BiOCl/n-ZnFeO H-Hs). The density and loading amounts of the BiOCl nanosheets with exposed {0\u202f0\u202f1} facets were easily controlled by adjusting the reactant concentration in the solvothermal process. The p-BiOCl/n-ZnFeO H-Hs exhibited enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activities for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB). The apparent first-order rate of the p-BiOCl/n-ZnFeO H-Hs and its normalized constant were about 12.6- and 8-fold higher than pure ZnFeO nanofibers. This suggests that both the improved charge separation efficiency from the uniform p-n heterojunctions and the enlarged active surface sites from the hierarchical structures increase the photocatalytic performances. Furthermore, the p-BiOCl/n-ZnFeO H-Hs could be efficiently separated from the solution with an external magnetic field via the ferromagnetic behavior of ZnFeO nanofibers. The magnetic p-BiOCl/n-ZnFeO H-Hs with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performances might have potential applications in water treatment.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum diselenide nanosheet/carbon nanofiber (MoSe/CNF) heterojunctions have been successfully obtained by a facile two-step synthesis route combining an electrospinning technique and solvothermal method. The results show that MoSe nanosheets distributed evenly on the carbon nanofibers without aggregation, and the loading amount of MoSe could be well controlled by adjusting the reactant concentrations during the solvothermal process for the fabrication of the MoSe/CNF heterojunctions. The as-prepared MoSe/CNF heterojunctions exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than pure MoSe for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible and infrared light irradiation. The normalized rate constant for the MoSe/CNF heterojunctions was nearly 3.2 times and 1.6 times higher than that of pure MoSe under visible light and infrared light (1.5\u202fW, 980\u202fnm laser) irradiation, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity might be attributed to the formation of heterojunctions, which could improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes at the MoSe/CNF heterojunctions interface. In addition, MoSe/CNF heterojunctions could be efficiently separated from the solution by sedimentation due to their ultralong one-dimensional and self-supporting structure. Such MoSe/CNF heterojunctions with a broad-spectrum-response photocatalytic performance might have potential applications in water treatment.",

        "abstract": "The 2,9,16,23-tetranitro phthalocyanine copper (II) nanostructures and bismuth oxychloride nanosheets were grown on electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers in sequence by solvothermal method. As a result, the BiOCl/CuTNPc heterostructures were uniformly immobilized on the PAN nanofibers. The obtained BiOCl/CuTNPc/PAN nanofibers had excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under UV-vis light irradiation. The first-order rate constant of the BiOCl/CuTNPc/PAN nanofibers was 5.86 and 6.31 times as much as CuTNPc/PAN and BiOCl/PAN nanofibers, respectively. The high photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the formation of BiOCl/CuTNPc heterostructures, which helped the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Concurrently, the marcoporous structure of the BiOCl/CuTNPc/PAN nanofibers improved the photocatalytic activity due to the increased interface contacts between the photocatalyst and the RhB solution. The BiOCl/CuTNPc/PAN nanofibers did not need to be separated for reuse due to their flexible self-supporting properties originating from the PAN nanofibers. Moreover, the film-like BiOCl/CuTNPc/PAN nanofibers could float easily on the liquid and maximize the absorption of sunlight during photocatalysis. It was expected that the BiOCl/CuTNPc/PAN nanofibers with high photocatalytic activity and easily separable property will possess great potential in the field of industrial applications and environmental remediation.",

Results revealed that WO3 interconnected porous structures have channels of 3\u201310\u00a0\u00b5m and wall thicknesses of about 0.68\u00a0\u00b5m. Interestingly, the morphology and porous structure of WO3 samples can be well controlled by the amount of PVA and calcination temperature. To further demonstrate their potential application in photocatalysis, their photocatalytic activities for the photodegradation of Rhodamine B under visible light irradiation were investigated. It was found that the highest photocatalytic activity was obtained by using the WO3 porous sample which prepared by fixing the addition amount of PVA at 7.5% (relative to solvent) and the calcination temperature at 800\u00a0\u00b0C. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of WO3 can be attributed to the combined effects of increased surface area, the interconnected macroporous as well as the enhanced crystal quality.",

        "abstract": "Catalyst immobilization is of much significance not only for maintaining the high activity of the ultrafine catalyst, but also for the separation of catalyst during the practical application. Herein, a novel support material, three-dimensional hierarchically porous silica (HPS) with interconnected micro-meso-macro pores and high specific surface area was successfully fabricated though a freeze-drying technique in the presence of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and subsequent calcination process. A series of characterizations revealed that the specific surface area of HPS can be well adjusted by changing the addition of PVA. The specific surface area of HPS was as high as 360\u202fm\u202fg, which was 211-fold higher than HPS-0 (silica prepared without using PVA). To demonstrate the potential application of such novel support material, highly dispersed silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were immobilized on the surfaces of HPS and HPS-0 through in-situ reduction. By contrast, the catalytic activity of AgNPs anchored on HPS (531\u202fs\u202fg) was about 42-fold higher than that of AgNPs anchored on HPS-0 (12.67\u202fs\u202fg). The significantly enhanced catalytic activity of AgNPs/HPS was believed to be related to their high specific surface area and interconnected macroporous scaffolds, which could provide numerous reactive sites and mass transfer routes for the reactants.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ultrafast laser pulse temporal shaping has been widely applied in various important applications such as laser materials processing, coherent control of chemical reactions, and ultrafast imaging. However, temporal pulse shaping has been limited to only-in-lab technique due to the high cost, low damage threshold, and polarization dependence. Herein we propose a novel design of ultrafast laser pulse train generation device, which consists of multiple polarization-independent parallel-aligned thin films. Various pulse trains with controllable temporal profile can be generated flexibly by multi-reflections within the splitting films. Compared with other pulse train generation techniques, this method has advantages of compact structure, low cost, high damage threshold and polarization independence. These advantages endow it with high potential for broad utilization in ultrafast applications.",

        "abstract": "Microholes, especially high aspect ratio, high-quality microholes with small diameters (<100\u00a0\u03bcm), have broad applications. However, it is very difficult for traditional drilling methods to obtain deep microholes, especially with aspect ratios of over 50:1. Femtosecond lasers provide a promising solution for efficient drilling of deep microholes with high-precision material removal, reduced recast/microcracks, minimized heat-affected zones, and the absence of plasma-shielding effects. In this work, a comparison study of high aspect ratio, high-quality microholes fabricated in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bulk substrate with the ambient pressure adjusted from 10\u00a0Pa (air) down to 1\u00a0Pa (vacuum) is presented. High aspect ratio (over 100:1) microholes were obtained in a vacuum environment. The contrast between microhole evolution in air and in vacuum was investigated. The results indicate that efficient energy propagation and easy ejection of ablated material/plasma are probably the most important benefits of drilling microholes in vacuum. The dependence of microhole shapes on different fabrication parameters, including pulse energy and ambient pressure, was investigated to quantitatively reveal the underlying mechanisms. The enhanced drilling effect in vacuum was only found in a high pulse energy region ( \u00a0>\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcJ), and it becomes saturated when the ambient pressure was reduced to ~10\u00a0Pa at a pulse energy of 50\u00a0\u03bcJ. Drilling microholes in a vacuum provides a simple and effective way of rapidly fabricating high aspect ratio, high-quality microholes.",

For exploring the full capability for information storage/display and enhancing the encryption security of metasurface holograms, smart multiplexing techniques together with suitable metasurface designs are highly demanded. Here, we integrate multiple polarization manipulation channels for various spatial phase profiles into a single birefringent vectorial hologram by completely avoiding unwanted cross-talk. Multiple independent target phase profiles with quantified phase relations that can process significantly different information in different polarization states are realized within a single metasurface. For our metasurface holograms, we demonstrate high fidelity, large efficiency, broadband operation, and a total of twelve polarization channels. Such multichannel polarization multiplexing can be used for dynamic vectorial holographic display and can provide triple protection for optical security. The concept is appealing for applications of arbitrary spin to angular momentum conversion and various phase modulation/beam shaping elements.",

The pulse fluence is altered to create various laser printing patterns for the etching mask, resulting in the sequential evolution of three distinct surface micro/nanostructures, namely, ring-like microstructures, flat-top pillar microstructures, and spike nanostructures. The characterized diameter of micro/nanostructures reveals that they can be flexibly tuned from the micrometer (\u223c2\u2009\u03bcm) to nanometer (\u223c313\u2009nm) scales by varying the laser pulse fluence in a wide range. Micro-Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy are utilized to demonstrate that the phase state changes from single-crystalline silicon (c-Si) to amorphous silicon (a-Si) after single-pulse femtosecond laser irradiation. This amorphous layer with a lower etching rate then acts as a mask in the wet etching process. Meanwhile...",

        "abstract": "Ultratrace molecular detections from a limited amount of highly diluted solutions can offer unprecedented benefits in the biomedical/analytical fields, such as in precancer diagnosis, forensic analysis, and food safety. However, huge difficulties exist in completely concentrating the target molecules within a sensitive area and thereby enhancing the detection sensitivity. Herein, we report the ultratrace molecular detection using a low-adhesive superhydrophobic surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (LAS-SERS) substrate fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation. The LAS-SERS substrate has good characteristics, including a contact angle as high as 154\u00b0, a contact angle hysteresis below 5\u00b0, and a simulated Raman signal enhancement factor of up to 6 \u00d7 10. Compared to the previously developed superhydrophobic SERS (S-SERS) methods, the low-adhesive nature of the LAS-SERS method can greatly reduce the final contact area, thus significantly enhancing the detection limit. In our experiments, the final contact area of the LAS-SERS substrate was reduced by 19.5 times, corresponding to an 88.1 times increase in the concentration effect, as compared to the highly adhesive S-SERS substrates fabricated using the same technique. The enhanced condensation effect led to a detection limit as low as 10 M, which shows an obvious improvement compared to that of the other non-photolithography methods. The method reported herein offers a facile and efficient approach to the cost-effective fabrication of a high-performance LAS-SERS substrate for ultratrace molecular detection.",

This technique exhibits prominent potential in three-dimensional packaging, fluidic devices, fiber sensing, biomedical devices, and aeronautics. However, the fundamental mechanisms remain mysterious. Using the femtosecond time-resolved pump-probe shadowgraph technique, this study revealed that the generation of cylindrical shockwaves inside the bulk material and the corresponding compression mechanism play key roles in the formation of high-aspect-ratio microholes. The phenomena were observed in all experiments of Bessel beam drilling of polymethyl methacrylate. In the aforementioned cases, the compression mechanism was confirmed by measuring sample mass losses that were experimentally determined to be negligible. By contrast, neither cylindrical shockwave nor compression mechanism was observed when a fused silica or Gaussian laser beam was involved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We report the influence of temporally decreasing pulse trains on femtosecond laser-induced chemical etching (FLICE) of fused silica. A systematic comparison of the unshaped pulse and decreasing pulse trains of femtosecond laser for FLICE was conducted, and the differences were interpreted using a plasma model. The results revealed that the decreasing pulse trains not only affected the etching efficiency but also affected the morphology of the etched crater. When an etched crater was pre-irradiated by decreasing pulse trains, it presented a funnel-like shape at the early stage of the etching process, which contrasted with the one pre-irradiated by unshaped pulse. At the later stage of the etching process, the funnel-like shape gradually disappeared, and the crater increased in size. Compared with the unshaped pulse under the same processing conditions, the decreasing pulse trains enhanced the etched crater volume by approximately 18\u202ftimes. Theoretical calculations based on the plasma model indicated that the free-electron density generated using the unshaped pulse was much higher than that generated by the decreasing pulse trains in skin layer of the sample during the first few hundred femtoseconds. The high free-electron density increased the reflectivity in skin layer of the sample; thus, the tail part of the incident pulse was strongly reflected. Consequently, the laser energy deposition into the fused silica sample decreased, eventually led to a low etching efficiency.",

In this work, metal@semiconductor core-shell nanocrystals with atomically organized interface, quasi-monocrystalline shell and diverse controllable structures/morphologies, which are hardly tractable by conventional synthetic strategies, are accessed by developing an aqueous cation exchange method. The combined studies including Mid-IR femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the superior metal-semiconductor interface attained by the presented method can greatly promote the extraction of hot electrons from metal to semiconductor (the quantum yield of hot electron injection was estimated at ~ 48%) in comparison with the nanostructures bearing unoptimized interfaces. Thus produced metal@semiconductor nanocrystals give 2\u20133 orders of magnitude enhancement in photocatalytic H2 evolution activity relative to their counterparts accessed by conventional methods.",

An abnormal annular-shaped energy deposition of the fundamental fs laser pulse can be found by using dual-wavelength superposition of the fundamental frequency (\u03c9) and the second-harmonic frequency (2\u03c9) of a fs Ti:sapphire laser, which is confirmed by real beam shape detection. Based on the annular-shaped energy distribution of dual-wavelength fs laser, a concentric quasi-plasmonic corral nanostructure can be imprinted on the Au thin film. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) excitations on the planar metallic nanostructures enable the manipulation of light on subwavelength scales. Thus, the pre-processed concentric quasi-plasmonic corral nanostructure can act as a precursor for the subsequent SPPs excitation and propagation by the fs laser irradiation. Using this technique, polarization-dependent semi-circular periodic surface structures on silicon can be found by the irradiation of fs laser pulse with only one shot. This research provides an additional freedom for the laser induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS) modulation based on the modulation of SPPs excitation and propagation, which plays an important role in the formation of LIPSS.",

To overcome the challenge of orientation controllability, we developed a feasible and efficient method for manipulating the orientation of LIPSS in real time. Specifically, we used orthogonally polarized and equal-energy femtosecond laser (50 fs, 800 nm) double-pulse trains with time delay about 1ps, total peak laser fluence about 1.0 J/cm, laser repetition frequency at 100 Hz and scanning speed at 150 \u03bcm/s to manipulate the LIPSS orientation on silicon surfaces perpendicular to the scanning direction, regardless of the scanning paths. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the periodic energy deposition along the direction of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which can be controlled oriented along the scanning direction in orthogonally polarized femtosecond laser double-pulse trains surface scan processing. An application of structural colors presents the functionality of our method.",

        "abstract": "The polarization state, which cannot be directly detected by human eyes, forms an important characteristic of electromagnetic waves. Control of polarization states has long been pursued for various applications. Conventional polarization converters can hardly meet the requirements in lab-on-chip systems, due to the involvement of bulk materials. Here, we propose the design and realization of a linear to circular polarization converter based on metasurfaces. The metasurface is deliberately designed using achiral two-fold mirror symmetry \u03a9-shaped antennas. The converter integrates a ground metal plane, a spacer dielectric layer and an antenna array, leading to a high conversion efficiency and broad operating bandwidth in the near infrared regime. The calculated Stokes parameters indicate an excellent conversion of linear to circular polarization for the reflected light. The tunability of the bandwidth by oblique incidence and by modulating the thickness of the dielectric layer is also introduced and demonstrated, which shows great flexibilities for such metasurface converters. The proposed metasurface may open up intriguing possibilities towards the realization of ultrathin nanophotonic devices for polarization manipulation and wavefront engineering.",

By using a temporally shaped femtosecond laser Bessel-beam-assisted chemical etching method, the energy deposition efficiency was improved by adjusting the pulse delay to yield a stronger material modification and, thus, a higher etching depth. The etching depth was enhanced by a factor of 13\u00a0using the temporally shaped Bessel beam. The mechanism of etching depth enhancement was elucidated by localized transient-free electrons dynamics-induced structural and morphological changes. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was conducted to verify the structural changes inside the material.

Herein, we propose a novel method for fabricating Au nanoparticle-decorated nanorod (NPDN) arrays through femtosecond laser irradiation combined with Au coating and annealing. The nanorod cavities strongly confined light and produced an enhanced optical field in response to Au nanoparticles (NPs) introduction. The nanogap and diameter of the fabricated Au NPs significantly affected the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance and could be simultaneously tuned with thickness-controllable Au films and substrate morphologies. The resulting Au NPDN substrate was observed to have efficient \u201chot spots\u201d for tunable SERS applications. We experimentally determined that the enhancement factor of the Au NPDN substrate reached up to 8.3 \u00d7 107 at optimal parameters. Moreover, the Au NPDN substrate showed superior chemical stability, with the greatest intensity deviation of 3.2%...",

The intensity distribution was shaped by using a spatial light modulator. The material was first selectively melted and then redistributed by the laser-induced plasma. Thus, complex surface patterns were formed conformal to the laser intensity distribution. Sub-diffraction-limit size can be achieved due to the nanoscale material redistribution. Only one pulse was needed in the surface patterning process, thus greatly favoring the efficiency improvement. Combined with multibeam interference, a large-scale nanostructure array can be fabricated with high efficiency of 1600 \u03bcm/pulse. This method offers a simple, flexible and efficient alternative approach for nanoscale surface patterning applications.",

        "abstract": "Metal nanowire fabrication has drawn tremendous attention in recent years due to its wide application in electronics, optoelectronics, and plasmonics. However, conventional laser fabrication technologies are limited by diffraction limit thus the fabrication resolution cannot meet the increasingly high demand of modern devices. Herein we report on a novel method for high-resolution high-quality metal nanowire fabrication by using Hermite-Gaussian beam to ablate metal thin film. The nanowire is formed due to the intensity valley in the center of the laser beam while the surrounding film is ablated. Arbitrary nanowire can be generated on the substrate by dynamically adjusting the orientation of the intensity valley. This method shows obvious advantages compared to conventional methods. First, the minimum nanowire has a width of ~60 nm (\u22481/13 of the laser wavelength), which is much smaller than the diffraction limit. The high resolution is achieved by combining the ultrashort nature of the femtosecond laser and the low thermal conductivity of the thin film. In addition, the fabricated nanowires have good inside qualities. No inner nanopores and particle intervals are generated inside the nanowire, thus endowing the nanowire with good electronic characteristics: the conductivity of the nanowires is as high as 1.2\u00d710 7  S/m (\u22481/4 of buck material), and the maximum current density is up to 1.66\u00d710 8  A/m 2 . Last, the nanowire has a good adhesion to the substrates, which can withstand ultrasonic bath for a long time. These advantages make our method a good approach for high-resolution high-quality nanowire fabrication as a complementary method to conventional lithography methods.",

Here, an approach with metasurfaces composed of nanoaperture arrays is proposed and experimentally demonstrated which can effectively manipulate the complex amplitude of SPPs in the near-field regime. Tailoring the azimuthal angles of individual nanoapertures and simultaneously tuning their geometric parameters, the phase and amplitude are controlled based on the Pancharatnam-Berry phases and their individual transmission coefficients.

Particularly, metasurfaces can provide a novel platform for splitting and diffracting light into several beams with desired profile, which is in contrast to traditional gratings. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel method for generating independently selective diffraction orders. Our method is based on complex amplitude modulation with ultrathin dielectric metasurfaces. By tailoring the geometric parameters of silicon nanofin structures, we can spatially control the geometric and dynamic phase as well as the amplitude simultaneously. We compare the results with a metasurface that uses a phase-only modulation, to verify such selective diffraction can be solely efficiently achieved with complex amplitude modulation. Besides, the diffraction angles of each order have been measured, which are consistent with standard grating theory. Our developed method for achieving selective diffraction with metasurfaces has potential applications in beam shaping, parallel laser fabrication, and nanoscale optical detection.",

The enormous freedom in metasurface design motivates the implementation of polarization control in ultrathin and compact optical systems. However, the majority of proposed strategies based on metasurfaces have been demonstrated only a spatially homogeneous polarization generation, while less attention has been devoted to spatially variant inhomogeneous vector beams. Here, we demonstrate a novel method for generating arbitrary radial and azimuthal polarization beams with high efficiencies of up to 80% by utilizing transmission-type dielectric metasurfaces. Polarization conversion metasurfaces are suitable candidates for the implementation of polarization encryption, which we demonstrate by encoding a hidden image into the spatial polarization distribution. In addition, we show that the image pattern can be modified by appropriate polarization selection of the transmitted light. Such a method may provide a practical technique for a variety of applications such as imaging, encryption and anti-counterfeiting.",

Here, multiplane holography with large information capacity by plasmonic metasurfaces using coupled dimers as components is realized. This study chooses an iterative 3D Fienup algorithm to get the phase profiles of such metasurface holograms. Two different metaholograms are fabricated to experimentally demonstrate the position and polarization multiplexing capacity, and the correlation coefficients between reconstructed images and target objects are analyzed to ensure the reconstruction quality.

Our study aims to develop an objective approach to depression detection that supports the process of diagnosis and assists the monitoring of risk factors. By classifying eye movement features during free viewing tasks, an accuracy of 80.1% was achieved using Random Forest to discriminate depressed and nondepressed subjects. Results indicate that eye movement features hold the potential to form a complimentary method of detection, having a relatively low computation overhead. Furthermore, given the proliferation of cheap internet eye movement detection technologies, the method offers the possibility of cost effective remote sensing of the patient mental state.",

The identification of affect using our procedures is integrated into a simulated distance learning system that provides feedback to the user with respect to attention and concentration. The authors propose a classification procedure that combines correlation-based feature selection (CFS) and a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) data mining algorithm. To evaluate the CFS+KNN algorithm, it was test against CFS+C4.5 algorithm and other classification algorithms. The classification performance was measured 10 times with different 3-fold cross validation data. The data was derived from 10 subjects while they were attempting to learn material in a simulated distance learning environment. A self-assessment model of self-report was used with a single valence to evaluate attention on 3 levels (high, neutral, low). It was found that CFS+KNN had a much better performance, giving the highest correct classification rate (CCR) of % for the valence dimension divided into three classes.",

Besides, more attention was paid to the number and length of links in brain networks, and the clustering partitioning of nodes was unclear. Therefore, minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis and the hierarchical clustering were first used for the depression disease in this study. Resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) sources were assessed from 15 healthy and 23 major depressive subjects. Then the coherence, MST, and the hierarchical clustering were obtained. In the theta band, coherence analysis showed that the EEG coherence of the MDD patients was significantly higher than that of the healthy controls especially in the left temporal region. The MST results indicated the higher leaf fraction in the depressed group. Compared with the normal group, the major depressive patients lost clustering in frontal regions. Our findings suggested that there was a stronger brain interaction in the MDD group and a left-right functional imbalance in the frontal regions for MDD controls.",

        "abstract": " Effective psychological function requires that cognition is not affected by task-irrelevant emotional stimuli in emotional conflict. Depression is mainly characterized as an emotional disorder. The object of this study is to reveal the behavioral and electrophysiological signature of emotional conflict processing in major depressive disorder (MDD) using event-related potentials (ERPs) and standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) analysis.  We used a face-word Stroop task involving emotional faces while recording EEG (electroencephalography) in 20 patients with MDD and 20 healthy controls (HCs). And then ERPs were extracted and the corresponding brain sources were reconstructed using sLORETA.  Behaviorally, subjects with MDDs manifested significantly increased Stroop effect when examining the RT difference between happy incongruent trials and happy congruent trials, compared with HC subjects. ERP results exhibited that MDDs were characterized by the attenuated difference between P300 amplitude to sad congruent stimuli and sad incongruent stimuli, as electrophysiological evidence of impaired conflict processing in subjects with MDD. The sLORETA results showed that MDD patients had a higher current density in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rostral ACC) within N450 time window in response to happy incongruent trials than happy congruent stimuli. Moreover, HC subjects had stronger activity in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) region in response to incongruent stimuli than congruent stimuli, revealing successful inhibition of emotional distraction in HCs, which was absent in MDDs.  Our results indicated that rostral ACC was implicated in the processing of negative emotional distraction in MDDs, as well as impaired inhibition of task-irrelevant emotional stimuli, relative to HCs. This work furnishes novel behavioral and neurophysiological evidence that are closely related to emotional conflict among MDD patients.",

But the methods to construct brain network still exist some issues to be solved. This study is to explore reliable and robust construction methods of functional brain network using different coupling methods and binarization approaches, based on high-density 128-channel resting state EEG recordings from 16 MDD patients and 16 normal controls (NC). It was found that the combination of imaginary part of coherence (ICoh) and Cluster-Span Threshold (CST) outperformed other methods. Based on this combination, right hemisphere function deficiency, symmetry breaking and randomized network structure were found in MDD, which confirmed that MDD had aberrant cognitive processing. Furthermore, clustering coefficient (CC) in left central region in theta band and node betweenness centrality (NBC) in right temporal region in alpha band were significantly negatively correlated with depressive level. And these network metrics had the ability to discriminate MDD from NC, which indicated that these network metrics might be served as the electrophysiological characteristics for probable MDD identification. Hence, our study may provide reliable methods to construct functional brain network and offer potential biomarkers in MDD.",

        "title": "EEG-based mild depression recognition using convolutional neural network.",
        "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG)-based studies focus on depression recognition using data mining methods, while those on mild depression are yet in infancy, especially in effective monitoring and quantitative measure aspects. Aiming at mild depression recognition, this study proposed a computer-aided detection (CAD) system using convolutional neural network (ConvNet). However, the architecture of ConvNet derived by trial and error and the CAD system used in clinical practice should be built on the basis of the local database; we therefore applied transfer learning when constructing ConvNet architecture. We also focused on the role of different aspects of EEG, i.e., spectral, spatial, and temporal information, in the recognition of mild depression and found that the spectral information of EEG played a major role and the temporal information of EEG provided a statistically significant improvement to accuracy. The proposed system provided the accuracy of 85.62% for recognition of mild depression and normal controls with 24-fold cross-validation (the training and test sets are divided based on the subjects). Thus, the system can be clinically used for the objective, accurate, and rapid diagnosis of mild depression. Graphical abstract The EEG power of theta, alpha, and beta bands is calculated separately under trial-wise and frame-wise strategies and is organized into three input forms of deep neural networks: feature vector, images without electrode location (spatial information), and images with electrode location. The role of EEG's spectral and spatial information in mild depression recognition is investigated through ConvNet, and the role of EEG's temporal information is investigated using different architectures to aggregate temporal features from multiple frames. The ConvNet and models for aggregating temporal features are transferred from the state-of-the-art model in mental load classification.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to investigate user visual attention level in their mobile shopping activities based on our eye-tracking experiment, which may potentially contribute to the development in mobile commerce website design. We found that the distribution of products information in a page may have a great impact on visual search behavior and reaction time. Reaction time is normally at a minimum when target element is put on the top left. Conversely, it tends to increase when target element is put on the bottom right. Moreover, visual attention focus between computer based web pages and mobile ones is also different based on our research in characteristics of eye-tracking. Previous study has reported that user focus is mostly on higher position entries in a search engine result page, however in our research, users concern the items displayed at the central area more than the top. This is probably because that the size of a mobile shopping page is not as big as a computer based web page, also with more limited information. This finding may be a hint to enhance mobile commerce website design.",

        "abstract": "Aims More data are needed about how genetic variation (GV) and environmental factors influence phenotypic variation within the natural populations of long-lived species with broad geographic distributions. To fill this gap, we examined the correlations among environmental factors and phenotypic variation within and among 13 natural populations of Pinus tabulaeformis consisting of four demographically distinct groups within the entire distributional range. Methods Using the Akaikeu0027s Information Criterion (AIC) model, we measured 12 morphological traits and constructed alternative candidate models for the relationships between each morphological trait and key climatic variables and genetic groups. We then compared the AIC weight for each candidate model to identify the best approximating model for ecogeographical variation of P. tabulaeformis. The partitioning of variance was assessed subsequently by evaluating the independent variables of the selected best models using partial redundancy analysis. Important Findings Significant phenotypic variation of the morphological traits was observed both within individual populations and among populations. Variation partition analyses showed that most of the phenotypic variation was co-determined by both GV and climatic factors. GV accounted for the largest proportion of reproductive trait variation, whereas local key climatic factors (i.e. actual evapotranspiration, AET) accounted for the largest proportion of phenotypic variation in the remaining investigated traits. Our results indicate that both genetic divergence and key environmental factors affect the phenotypic variation observed among populations of this species, and that reproductive and vegetative traits adaptively respond differently with respect to local environmental conditions. This partitioning of factors can inform those making predictions about phenotypic variation in response to future changes in climatic conditions (particularly those affecting AET).",

By adapting compound stimuli, the present study investigated whether the global or local properties played the main role in the uniqueness-facilitation effect in the MOT task. The uniqueness of local properties, of global properties or of both local and global properties were considered. Observers' tracking performance in alternative conditions were compared with that in the homogeneous condition wherein all stimuli have identical local and global properties. Results from two experiments suggest that the global properties played the key role in facilitating tracking. The distinctiveness of local properties can also facilitate tracking with global properties being homogeneous. However, when the stimuli's global properties are distinct from each other-whether the local properties being unique or not-observers' tracking performance can achieve the same level as that in the unitary-uniqueness condition wherein the moving objects were distinct unitary letters. These results revealed a global superiority effect in the MOT task. Finally, the facilitation effects of the global and local properties might depend on the stimulus sparsity. When the compound stimuli had fewer local elements, the uniqueness facilitation effect on tracking decreased.",

        "abstract": "Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted enormous research attention as a promising low cost, visible-light driven semiconductor photocatalyst. However, low photoabsorption efficiencies and unsatisfactory charge separation limit the potential of g-C3N4 in many applications, motivating attempts to manipulate the structure and electronic properties of g-C3N4 to achieve improved performance. Here we describe a novel precursor-reforming strategy that ultimately affords 3D mesoporous ultrathin g-C3N4 with superior photocatalytic performance compared to conventional calcination-derived g-C3N4. We demonstrate that during hydrothermal treatment of melamine and urea, melamine undergoes an irreversible monoclinic to orthorhombic phase transformation, and the additive urea (excess typically 3-fold) serves as an additional N source and porogen. Calcination of the orthorhombic melamine yields mesoporous g-C3N4 with enhanced photoabsorption properties and an outstanding photoactivity. A 23-fold increased hydrogen evolution rate of 3579 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121 (\u03bb > 420 nm) was achieved with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 27.8% at 420 \u00b1 15 nm, a level of performance far beyond any AQE previously reported for ultrathin/porous/doped g-C3N4 photocatalyst. Our work conclusively demonstrates a new synthetic strategy towards high performance g-C3N4-based photocatalytic materials for energy applications.",

        "abstract": "Facet-engineering and the deposition of co-catalysts lead to significant improvement in efficiency of semiconductors in photocatalytic applications. Here, we demonstrate, using the specific example of bismuth-oxy-bromide (BiOBr) particles, that facet-selective, photo-induced reductive or oxidative deposition of co-catalysts onto plate-like semiconductor particles is strongly pH-dependent. High resolution atomic force microscopy and spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the effect of pH is caused by a reversal of the surface charge of the [001] facets upon increasing pH from 3 to 9 (isoelectric point \u22485), while the side facets become increasingly negatively-charged. We discuss the effect of facet-surface-charge on particle distributions by band-bending, favoring either electron transfer and metal deposition, or hole transfer and metal-oxide deposition. This finding opens up new ways to design highly effective, photocatalytic composite architectures, containing spatially separated catalytic particles of multiple compositions.",

In this work, Jahn-Teller effects proved by Crystal Field Theory (CFT) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) are used to predict the electronic structures of MoO 3  and MoO 2  reasonably, such results guided us to design two more reasonable applications. On account of the metallicity tendency of MoO 2  with a stronger electron mobility from band structure, MoO 2 /rGO/g-C 3 N 4  composite was performed as a high-performance electrode in asymmetric supercapacitors (SCs). MoO 2  with the assistance of mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride and high conductivity graphene shows an enhanced capacity at 1700\u202fF\u202fg \u22121  at 1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121  and cycling retention at 84% retention after 3000 cycles for supercapacitors, the corresponding assemble asymmetric devices shows a maximum power density of 6.25\u202fkW\u202fkg \u22121  at an energy density of 16.0\u202fW\u202fh\u202fkg \u22121 . Furthermore, the proper band structure of MoO 3  predicted by DFT calculation has guided MoO 3 /rGO composite as a photocatalyst to degrade tetracycline, which shows a high elimination efficiency of 90.6% within 2\u202fh illumination of simulated solar light.",

The composition, structure, and morphology of the intercalated products as well as their release behavior are determined experimentally and theoretically by Material Studio 5.5. Experimental results disclose the strong interaction between the LDHs sheets and AA in the intercalated ZnAl-LDHs produced by co-precipitation and slow release of AA from the intercalated ZnAl-LDHs in both phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and borate buffered saline (BBS) solutions. The percentage of AA released from the ZnAl-LDHs prepared by both methods in PBS (96.87% and 98.12%) are much more than those in BBS (68.59% and 81.22%) implying that both H4BO4(-) and H2PO4(-) can exchange with AA in the ZnAl-LDHs. After AA is released to PBS, ZnAl-LDHs break into small pieces. The experimental results are explained theoretically based on the calculation of the bonding energy between the anions and LDHs sheets as well as the AlO bond length change in the LDHs sheets. ",

The introduction of O and Cl vacancies gives rise to enormous amelioration on the crystal structure, electronic band structure, and surface state, thereby resulting in enhanced photoabsorption and a remarkably enhanced surface charge transfer efficiency (11-fold enhancement). Profiting from these merits, BiO1\u2013xCl1\u2013y exhibits highly promoted photocatalytic oxidation ability and an efficient activity for selective CO2 reduction into CO. Interestingly...",

Meanwhile, high-index facets with a high density of low-coordinated atoms always serve as reactive catalytic sites. However, fabrication of multi-facets or high-index facets is highly challenging for layered bismuth-based photocatalysts confined by their layered crystal structure. Here, we report the preparation of unprecedented eighteen-faceted BiOCl exposed by {001} top facets and {102} and {112} oblique facets via a prolonged hydrothermal process. Compared to the conventional BiOCl square plates with {001} top facets and {110} lateral facets, the eighteen-faceted BiOCl with co-exposure of {001}, {102} and {112} facets demonstrates highly enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution and hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH) production. Theoretical calculations and photodeposition results disclose that the fabrication of eighteen-faceted BiOCl enables well-matched {001}/{102}/{112} ternary facet junction, which provides a cascade path for more efficient charge flow than {001}/{110} binary facet junction in BiOCl square plates, thus resulting in greatly enhanced surface charge transfer efficiency (\u0273trans). The findings may advance our understanding on surface charge migration behaviours and offer a reference for synthesis of layered materials with multi-facets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   An effective and facile method was developed to remove As(V) and alkali simultaneously from alkaline wastewater based on the repeated in-situ formation of Zn\u2013Al\u2013AsO 4  layered double hydroxide (ZnAl\u2013AsO 4  LDH). The removal efficiency of As(V) was almost 100% and the pH of the treated alkaline wastewater decreased from 12 to 7.47. Removal of As(V) was not affected by competitive anions such as SO 4  2\u2212 , F \u2212 , Cl \u2212 , and NO 3  \u2212  due to the large binding energy between As(V) and LDH sheets as confirmed by calculations based on the Castep Module of Materials. About 96% of As(V) can be released and concentrated into a small volume of Na 2 CO 3  solution for disposal or recovery. The LDH was then dissolved in HNO 3  and the solution can be used to treat wastewater to reform Zn\u2013Al LDH for further removal of arsenate. This process was repeated four times but after the fifth cycle, the removal efficiency went down by the loss of Al 3+  to solution but the process can be repeated by replenishing the solution with Al 3+ . The newly developed process is eminently suited for remediation of arsenate and alkali simultaneously from alkaline wastewater.",

The photoresponsive range of the self-doped Bi2O2CO3 can be extended from UV to visible light and the band gap can be continuously tuned. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrate that the foreign CO32\u2013 ions are doped in the caves constructed by the four adjacent CO32\u2013 ions and the CO32\u2013 self-doping can effectively narrow the band gap of Bi2O2CO3 by lowering the conduction band position and meanwhile generating impurity level. The photocatalytic performance is evaluated by monitoring NO removal from the gas phase, photodegradation of a colorless contaminant (bisphenol A, BPA) in an aqueous solution, and photocurrent generation. In comparison with the pristine Bi2O2CO3 which is not sensitive to visible light, the self-doped Bi2O2CO3 exhibits drastically enhanced visible-light photoreactivity, which is also superior to that of many other ...",

To get in-depth insight into these complicated processes steered by different exposing facets, herein BiOCl with exposed (001) and (010) facets engaged as the model are investigated. The BiOCl-(010) and BiOCl-(001) single-crystalline sheets are separately synthesized via hydrothermal and hydrolysis routes. In contrast to BiOCl-(010), BiOCl-(001) demonstrates highly promoted photo-redox performance for H generation and degradation of pollutants. The facet-dependent charge movement behaviors were surveyed by surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPV), transient photocurrent, linear sweep voltammetry, continuous wavelength photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS). All the photoelectrochemical and photoelectric measurement results reflect that BiOCl-(001) exhibits superior charge separation and migration efficiencies in the whole charge movement process than the BiOCl-(010). Besides, a higher charge carrier density (3.1-fold enhancement) was also observed for BiOCl-(001) compared to BiOCl-(010). Our current work is expected to further our understanding on facet-dependent charge movement behaviors and offer new insight into design of high-performance photocatalytic/photoelectrochemical materials.",

The NPOH-0.5@rGO electrode combines the advantages of the NPOH hollow microspheres and the conductive rGO layers giving rise to a large specific capacitance, high cycling reversibility, and excellent rate performance. The NS-3D rGO electrode with abundant porosity and active sites promotes electrolyte infiltration and broadens the working voltage range. The ASC (NPOH-0.5@rGO//NS-3D rGO) shows a maximum voltage of up to 1.4 V, outstanding cycling ability (capacitance retention of 95.5% after 10,000 cycles), and excellent rate capability (capacitance retention of 77% as the current density is increased ten times). The ASC can light up an light-emitting diodes (LED) for more than 20 min after charging for 20 s.

To examine such a hypothesis, the present study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of MPs in sludge by analyzing 79 sewage sludge samples collected from 28 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 11 Chinese provinces. MP concentrations in the sludge samples ranged from 1.60-56.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 particles per kilogram of dry sludge, with an average of 22.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 particles per kilogram of dry sludge. Thereinto, the sludge-based MP contents were greater in eastern China than in western China and varied during different months. Their colors and types were mainly white (59.6%) and fibers (63%), respectively. Microscope Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that most of MPs belonged to polyolefin, acrylic fibers, polyethylene and polyamide. Some WWTP parameters, such as servicing area, proportion of industrial wastewater, secondary treatment and sludge dewatering may have affected MP concentrations in sludge. Based on the total sludge production in China, the average amount of sludge-based MPs entering into natural environmental was estimated to be 1.56\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 particles per year. The findings confirmed that sewage sludge discharge is an important source of MP pollution in the environment. Further evaluation of the associated environmental hazards with MPs is deemed necessary.",

Aromatic repolymerization of HA supplies more aromatic electron-rich sites to form neo-humic polymers and to determine the distribution of organic and/or inorganic phytotoxic compounds; thus, aromatic repolymerization of HA may control the digestate phytotoxicity by reducing excessive salinity. The results showed the effect of HA repolymerization on digestate stabilization and phytotoxicity reduction during the high-solid AD process. The inadequate phytotoxicity reduction efficiency (SGI\u202f\u2264\u202f17%) may be ascribed to unaccomplished HA repolymerization, creating a demand for humification intensification studies.",

Results showed that the OSW weight loss mainly occurred in the second pyrolysis stage relating to organic matter decomposition. Compared with raw substrate, the weight loss of corresponding digestate was lower in the range of 180-550\u00b0C, but was higher in 550-900\u00b0C. GFPM analysis revealed that organic components volatized at peak temperatures of 188-263, 373-401 and 420-462\u00b0C had a faster degradation rate than those at 274-327\u00b0C during anaerobic digestion. DAEM analysis showed that anaerobic digestion had discrepant effects on activation energy for four OSW pyrolysis, possibly because of their different organic composition. It requires further investigation for the special organic matter, i.e., protein-like and carbohydrate-like groups, to confirm the assumption.",

Organic matter degradation and microbial community succession were determined by fluorescent and X-ray photoelectron spectrometers, and Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis during the process. Results showed that specific oxygen uptake rate, volatile solid and ammonia nitrogen contents of the ADS reduced by 36.1\u201386.4%, 8.4\u201316.2% and 70.2\u201385.4%, respectively after micro-aerobic digestion, and these changes had an increasing tendency with the temperature. They implied that micro-aerobic digestion promoted in-depth stabilization of the ADS, which temperature increase had a positive effect on. Protein-like and carbohydrate-like groups decreased, and humic acid-like and carboxyl materials enriched, while microbial community succession shifted from unassigned bacteria and Tepidimicrobium to Pseudomonas and Desulfuromonadales during the micro-aerobic process. Phytotoxicity tests revealed that micro-aerobic digestion reduced the inhibition of the ADS to germination and root growth of three plant seeds, but temperature had an adverse impact on the phytotoxicity reduction. Overall, the findings indicated that mesophilic micro-aerobic digestion was an alternative technique for the post-treatment of high-solid ADS.",

        "abstract": "The chemical characteristics of the refractory organic matter in anaerobic and aerobic digestates are hardly known although they are significant for further improving the degradation of organic matter during sludge digestion. Thus, in this study, various techniques are used to analyze the molecular properties of the total organic matter in raw sludge and mesophilic anaerobic and aerobic digestates (AnD and AoD, respectively). The results show that AnD has lower organic matter content, but the maturity and aromatization of its organic matter are lower than those of AoD. The FTIR and XPS spectra show that AoD has higher proportions of protein-like and aromatic groups and lower percentages of polysaccharide-like materials and ammonia nitrogen compared with AnD. The solid-phase fluorescence spectra indicate that AoD has a higher content of fluorescence organic matter, but its biodegradability and chemical accessibility are lower than those of AnD. Pyrolysis GC/MS analysis shows that the digestates are enriched with more lignin-like and aromatic groups and contain lower oxycompounds compared with raw sludge, especially AoD. These findings provide new insights into the molecular characteristics of the refractory organic matter in anaerobic and aerobic digestates and also provide a possible strategy to further enhance the degradation of organic matter in sewage sludge.",

        "abstract": "Microplastics (MPs) as new pollutants of environmental concern have been widely detected in sewage sludge, and may act as significant vectors for metal pollutants due to their adsorption property. Our findings show that Cd, Pb, and Co, but not Ni, contents in sewage sludge are lower than that of corresponding metal irons adsorbed on sludge-based MPs, indicating that the MPs accumulate such metal pollutants as Cd in the sludge samples. In contrast to virgin MPs, sludge-based MPs are one order of magnitude higher adsorption capacity for Cd, which reaches up to 2.523\u202fmg\u202fg, implying that there is a considerable enhancement in adsorption potential of the MPs for metals after the wastewater treatment process. SEM analysis shows that sludge-based MPs have rougher and more porous surface than virgin MPs, and FTIR spectra reveal that functional groups such as CO and OH are found on sludge-based MPs. Further, two-dimensional FTIR correlation spectroscopy indicates that CO and NH functional groups play a vital role in the process that sludge-based MPs adsorb Cd, which are not found in virgin MPs. The results imply that increased adsorption potentials of the sludge-based MPs to Cd are attributed to changes in the MP physicochemical properties during wastewater treatment process. In addition, such factors as pH value, and sludge inorganic and organic components also have an effect on the MP adsorption to Cd. Principal component analysis shows that the MPs could be divided into three categories, i.e. polyamide, rubbery MPs (polyethylene and polypropylene) and glassy MPs (polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene). Their adsorption potentials to Cd follow the decreasing order: polyamide\u202f>\u202frubbery MPs\u202f>\u202fglassy MPs. In summary, these findings indicate that MPs may exert an important influence on fate and transport of metal pollutants during sewage sludge treatment process, which deserves to be further concerned.",

In the present study, an online thermogravimetry (TG)\u2013Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR)\u2013mass spectrometry (MS) technology was used to investigate the effect of anaerobic digestion (AD) on gaseous products from sewage sludge pyrolysis. Compared with the raw sludge, the anaerobically digested sludge had similar derivative TG (DTG) profiles and evolved gaseous composition, but its weight loss and releasing amount of most of gaseous compounds during the pyrolysis was lower. AD caused a decrease in the emission of N-containing and Cl-containing gaseous groups by 22.4\u201387.6%, but an increase in one possible S-containing group by 20.1%. The generation of more-than-186- m / z  gaseous components showed a low reduction and even a slight increase after AD, possibly ascribed to thermal decomposition of some large refractory polysaccharide\u2013like and aromatic substances. Some gaseous compounds such as CH 4 , CH 3 COOH, and CH 3 CHO obtained from the sludge pyrolysis reduced significantly after AD, which might enable to conveniently and quickly evaluate sludge anaerobic biodegradability. The findings imply that the TG-FTIR-MS supplies new insights about the influence of AD on sludge pyrolysis on the account of gaseous products.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Bdelloid rotifer are reported to play a promoting role in microbial aggregation and floc formation in activated sludge systems; however, the mechanisms involved in this process are unclear. This study explores the effect of a rotifer secretion (RS) from the species  Philodina erythrophthalma  on the flocculation and growth of two bioflocculation-producing bacteria isolated from activated sludge. Results show that although the secretion has weak bioflocculability in itself, it can significantly enhance the flocculability of bioflocculation-producing bacteria and promote formation of microbial aggregation and floc. The possible mechanism is that the RS causes an increase in the bacteria densities and extracellular polymeric substance contents. The improvement of flocculability using RS shows an S-curve changing tendency with collection time, and corresponds with the first-order model with secretion dosage. Chemical composition analysis shows that low contents of non-protein organic nitrogen and polysaccharides are found in the RS, which implies that RS acts more like a growth-promoting substance or infochemical than as a nutrient in the promotion of bacterial growth. In conclusion, the findings provide a novel and potential strategy for promoting sludge floc formation using the infochemical secreted by this rotifer.",

In this paper, the following method was proposed to accurately determine the initial gas desorption law of coal. First, real-time temperature and pressure data of sealed coal sample tank after the sudden exposure of coal that had reached adsorption equilibrium within the tank were collected first via a high-precision, high-frequency response sensor. Then, the mass flow of gas passing through the pneumatic component at different times was calculated according to flow rate characteristics of pneumatic component that communicated with the atmosphere on the tank. In this process, it is determined that a convergent nozzle with a larger contraction ratio should be used as the channel for gas desorption and release. Moreover, in light of the characteristics of the testing process, the existing parameters that characterize the flow characteristics of pneumatic component were optimized and measured. Finally, the initial gas desorption laws of two coal samples with different metamorphic degrees were measured and analyzed under two pressures using three different-sized convergent nozzles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The spontaneous combustion of residual coal and potentially subsequent gas explosions that occur during gas drainage of the gob were investigated. The 1262 fully-mechanized mining face of the Dingji Coal Mine (Huainan, China) was used as a research benchmark. The methane and oxygen distributions were simulated as well as the temperature field associated with different gas-drainage models. Using a steady-state simulation method for temperature cut-off, linear superimposition of various parameters was used to determine the hazardous zones arising from the coupling of gas and spontaneously combustible coal. The results show that when gas drainage is applied, the range of oxidation zone is different with different gas drainage modes. Among three different drainage modes, when applying the buried pipes and cross-measure boreholes mode, the methane concentration near the working face and in the upper corner of the return airway not only can be effectively reduced, but the size of the oxidation zone in the gob is the smallest. Based on the model of buried pipes, cross-measure boreholes and surface wells, the coupled gas\u2013coal hazard zones were derived. The results show that the coupled hazard zone shifts to the deeper parts of the gob as a result of gas drainage, and the scope of the hazard zone is enlarged in the strike, dip, and vertical directions to different extents. The cooling effect is better when the nitrogen is injected into the deep part of the gob rather than the shallow part. Furthermore, nitrogen injected from double boreholes in the deep part appears to exert the largest cooling effect.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The gas pressure of a coal seam is one of the important parameters for studying gas reserves, law of gas flows, gas emissions, predicting coal and gas outburst risks and developing gas-control measures. In this study, the effects of the depth of the borehole drilled in a coal seam on the time required to determine the gas pressure and its value were discussed. Accordingly, elastic-plastic mechanics were applied to analyze the variation in the stress around the borehole, and the effective flow radii expressions of the spherical and radial flow boreholes were derived. The  COMSOL Multiphysics numerical simulation  software, was used to simulate the gas-flow range of the boreholes drilled at different depths in a coal seam, which were exposed for approximately 2\u00a0h. Finally, the boreholes of different depths was used to determine the gas pressure of No. \u4e8c 2  coal seam in the Xuehu coal mine (Henan Province, China). The results show that the time required in measuring the gas pressure is longer for boreholes drilled to a greater depth in a coal seam. For the same exposure times, the determined gas-pressure value will be smaller. Furthermore, the confined water and fractures in the roof and floor of the coal seam can be sealed by injecting high-pressure slurry into the borehole, which provides a reference for determining the gas pressure of the coal seam quickly under different geological conditions in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coal and gas outbursts are a rapid and powerful energy-releasing process. The damage to coal and the release of gas in the initial stage play key roles in the occurrence of outbursts. Existing studies have mainly focused on the gas desorption processes in coal under specific conditions such as particle size, specified mass and exposure time of pulverized coal. However, these studies have focused less on the gas release during the initial stage, and the quantitative relationship between the outburst risk level and the test results. Seven coal samples with different metamorphic degrees were chosen for use in outburst simulation experiments to investigate trends in gas release from pulverized coal in the presence of N 2  and CO 2 . The results demonstrate a strong correlation between the gas release capacity during the first 10\u202fs and natural desorption gas content of the onset of coal exposure during the first 120\u202fmin. In general, the higher the gas content, the larger the released gas volume, and thus the larger the limiting amount of desorptive gas. The gas release from an outburst coal sample is larger than that from a non-outburst coal sample within the first 10\u202fs. There is a good linear relationship between the initial volume of released gas (in the first 10\u202fs) and the initial expansion energy of released gas (IEERG), which can reflect the risk of coal outburst. Thus, according to the outburst critical value (42.98\u202fmJ/g) of IEERG, the critical value of initial volume of released gas could be calculated to be 1.113\u202fcm 3 /g. The results can provide a reference for further study of the effect of gas on outbursts and the investigation of coal and gas outbursts disasters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coal and gas outburst accidents occurring in underground coal mines generally cause great casualties and economic losses, especially in construction areas of coal seams where the outburst risks are not accurately evaluated. Therefore, accurately identifying the outburst risks of coal seams is necessary and critical to prevent and control outbursts. In order to improve the prediction accuracy for outbursts in working faces of coal roadways, a self-designed drilling device that can simulate the  in-situ  outburst prediction of coal roadways was used in this study. We used the coal samples with different coal ranks to adsorb CO 2  and N 2  with different pressures in the laboratory, so as to simulate the coal seams with different outburst risks. Finally, boreholes for predicting the outburst risk were drilled in the simulated coal seams to study the correlation between common dynamic phenomena (e.g. gas and coal being ejected from the borehole (GCEB) and drill pipe being stuck by coal mass in the borehole (DPSC)) and outburst risks. The results show that the greater the outburst risks of coal seams, the more frequent the occurrence of GCEB and DPSC is. The GCEB phenomenon for outburst prediction is attributed to small-sized coal and gas outbursts in boreholes, while the occurrence of DPSC phenomenon does not affirm that there definitely are outburst risks on working faces.  The DPSC phenomenon indicating outburst risks is generally accompanied with GCEB, which form a linkage system and are triggered successively.",

        "abstract": "In the process of working face advance in longwall coal mining, a great deal of gas relieved by the strata adjacent to the mining coal seam and the residual coal in gob migrates to gob. If the gas drainage method in gob is unreasonable, gas will accumulate in the upper corner and overrun in the return air flow. In the paper, a CFD (computational fluid mechanics) model of gob based on the actual geological conditions and gas drainage mode of 1262 working face of Dingji Coal Mine, China, was established. The gas drainage modes that should be taken to effectively control gas accumulation in the upper corner and gas overrun in the return air flow at different gas emission rates were discussed. The simulation results show that when the gas emission rate in the working face is lower than 20\u00a0m3/min, buried pipe drainage can effectively control gas accumulation in the upper corner and gas overrun in the return air flow. When gas emission rate there is between 20 and 30\u00a0m3/min, the two problems can be solved through cross-measure borehole drainage combined with buried pipe drainage. When gas emission rate there is higher than 40\u00a0m3/min, they can be effectively controlled through a three-dimensional drainage mode including buried pipes, cross-measure boreholes, and surface wells. Arranging surface wells within the fractured zone near the return airway can increase the gas drainage rate, and the gas concentration can reach over 85%; the gas concentrations of buried pipe drainage and cross-measure borehole drainage are 15~20% and 70~80%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coal and gas outbursts (hereinafter, collectively referred to as \u2018outbursts\u2019) often last for just a few tens of seconds and occur mostly in gas-bearing tectonically-deformed (TD) coal. It has been proved that, in comparison to primary-undeformed (PU) coal, TD coal is more susceptible to outbursts due to its lower mechanical strength, stronger gas-adsorption capability, and faster gas-desorption rate. At the same time, the energy required for the outburst process is mainly provided by the gas. However, the characteristics of the gas-desorption behavior and gas-release energy in TD and PU coal during the first dozen seconds or so have rarely been studied. In this study, gas desorption experiments were carried out on TD and PU coal at different gas pressures using self-assembled desorption equipment. The experiments focus on roughly the first 13\u202fs. The results show that the drop rate of gas pressure is lower with TD coal compared to PU coal, while the gas desorption rate is higher for TD coal compared to PU coal. Most of the gas is released from the two types of coal in the first few seconds. For both TD and PU coal, the time taken to release 90% of the total gas expansion energy (TGEE) is shorter than that to release 90% of the total gas energy (TGE). At the different gas pressures used, the TGEE of the two types of coal accounts for about 14\u201316% of the TGE. The higher the gas pressure is, the greater the TGEE released by the coal samples gets, and thus the larger the TGEE: TGE ratio becomes. Although the TGEE released from the TD coal is about 3 times that released from the PU coal, it accounts for a slightly smaller proportion of the TGE compared to that in the PU coal samples.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Given the increasing exploitation depth, outburst under the condition of uncovering coal in crosscut is increasingly dangerous. To prevent the occurrence of outburst, a novel forecast indicator, which is the initial volume of gas emission from the borehole (IVGEB) was proposed to validate the outburst-prevention effect. A self-developed experimental device for measuring the initial rate of gas emission from the borehole (IRGEB) was developed correspondingly. The IVGEB value is the sum of the unit length of IRGEB.  Experiments have been conducted under different gas injection rates and gas pressures. CO 2  and N 2  gases have been used as injection media. After 50 test runs, 48 sets of valid data have been collected. The results suggested that the IVGEB value is approximately proportional to the gas pressure: the higher the gas pressure, the larger the IVGEB value. Furthermore, based on the relationship of the initial expansion energy of released gas (IEERG), which is another forecast indicator and gas pressure, the weak outburst pressure  P   1   and intense outburst pressure  P   2   of each coal sample could be calculated because the critical values of IEERG were 42.98 and 103.8\u00a0mJ/g, respectively. Thus, the IVGEB critical value of weak outburst and intense outburst could be obtained by applying a relation formula between IVGEB and gas pressure. The obtained IVGEB critical value of weak outburst and intense outburst were 39.69\u00a0L and 93.32\u00a0L, respectively. This approach might provide a possible method to validate the outburst-prevention effect quickly in the process of uncovering coal in crosscuts within deep mines.",

        "abstract": "The fracture patterns of brittle materials in different stress loading modes are different. In order to study the fracture characteristics of brittle materials under confining pressure, in this study, both uniaxial compression tests and loading confining pressure tests were conducted on three concrete samples of different strengths, respectively. Meanwhile, the failure process of the samples during the loading of confining pressure was monitored using an acoustic wave tester; finally, the failure characteristics of the concrete samples were further investigated on a mesoscopic level by carrying out numerical simulations. The test results show that different failure modes were revealed in the concrete samples subjected to uniaxial compression: The failure initially started at both ends and then gradually extended to the middle part along the longitudinal direction; eventually, splitting failure, single inclined plane shear failure and conjugated inclined plane shear failure occurred. However, as the confining pressure was loaded, the samples failed merely in a simple mode, that is, the fractures occurred around the middle parts of the samples, perpendicular to the specimens axis. According to the acoustic measurements, the local failure processes before fracturing under confining pressure were consistent with those under uniaxial compression. The simulation results suggest that the failure initially started inside the samples due to the effects of longitudinal tensile stress under confining pressure, and then, it gradually extended to both sides along the lateral direction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coal and gas outbursts (hereinafter referred to as \u2018outbursts\u2019) result in serious damage and often occur in tectonically-deformed coal that is rich in gas. It has been demonstrated that the level of outburst risk declines with increasing coal moisture content. Moreover, an outburst generally lasts for mere tens of seconds and the required energy is mainly provided by the gas expansion energy. However, the gas desorption and energy release characteristics of tectonically deformed coal with different moisture contents during the first dozen seconds have not often been studied. In this study, a set of self-designed gas desorption equipment was used to carry out gas adsorption-desorption experiments in the first dozen seconds (about 13\u202fs) on coal with different moisture contents. The results show that the drop rate of the gas pressure increases with an increase in coal moisture content, and the total amount of gas desorption and the mass flow rate of gas desorption reduce correspondingly in the gas desorption process. Moreover, the gas velocity also slows with increasing moisture content. Under different gas pressures, the total gas expansion energy (TGEE) and the total gas energy (TGE) released from the coal decrease with the increasing moisture content. Correspondingly, it takes a shorter time for coal to release 90% of the TGEE and the TGE. For all of the coal samples, the time taken for releasing 90% of the TGEE is shorter than that for releasing 90% of the TGE. Meanwhile, the ratio of TGEE in the TGE increases with the increasing moisture content. The TGEE accounts for 14\u201316% of the TGE released from coal samples of different moisture contents under different gas pressures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The advantages and disadvantages of existing methods for predicting coal and gas outbursts in coal roadways were analyzed, and the primary factors influencing coal and gas outbursts, including the expansion energy of the initially released gases, were studied. To this end, a theoretical formula for calculating the amount of gas released from boreholes during drilling was deduced. In addition, it was determined that the gas emission per unit borehole length was related to the ground stress, gas pressure, and coal strength around the borehole during drilling. By collecting these continuously released gases from boreholes during drilling, that is, by adopting line prediction technology, the influence of those parameters (ground stress, gas pressure, coal strength) on the outburst process can be determined, and the outburst hazard can be predicted. To test this approach, a specially developed line prediction device was applied to the No. 3 coal seam of the Xinyuan coal mine, Shanxi Province, China. The test results demonstrate that the gas emissions per meter of borehole,  Q  Lm , measured by the line prediction technique differed between outburst and non-outburst samples. Additionally, compared with existing indices used for predicting coal and gas outbursts in coal roadways, including  K  1  and  S  max , the line prediction technique was more sensitive and could reflect the outburst hazard in front of working faces more accurately.",

To further improve our understanding of outburst mechanism and help more effective outburst prevention and control measures to be devised, a finite number of outburst simulation tests were carried out in the study. The results show that the contribution of the gas pressure to the energy required for an outburst is hundreds of times that of the  in situ  stress during the outburst. With increasing mining depths, the higher the  in situ  stress, the gas pressure, and the temperature; however, the temperature shows the lowest influence on the outburst intensity among various parameters such as gas pressure, the thickness of soft coal, and the temperature. The initial expansion energy of releasing gas (IEERG) is an index reflecting the influences of  in situ  stress, gas pressure, and coal strength on outburst intensity. The test results indicate that the potential amount of coal ejected can be predicted by measuring the IEERG of coal masses and the thickness of soft coal in outburst-prone zones. According to the failure characteristics of coal masses after an outburst, the larger the outburst intensity is, the smaller the volume of residual coal area relative to the outburst holes. The shapes of extrusive coal-gas flows after an outburst show that the outburst process is a chain of events occurring over multiple cycles as follows: preparation, initiation, development, and termination. The recorded video footage of an outburst also shows this.",

        "abstract": "The risk of coal and gas outbursts can be predicted using a method that is linear and continuous and based on the initial gas flow in the borehole (IGFB); this method is significantly superior to the traditional point prediction method. Acquiring accurate critical values is the key to ensuring accurate predictions. Based on ideal rock cross-cut coal uncovering model, the IGFB measurement device was developed. The present study measured the data of the initial gas flow over 3\u2009min in a 1\u2009m long borehole with a diameter of 42\u2009mm in the laboratory. A total of 48 sets of data were obtained. These data were fuzzy and chaotic. Fisher\u2019s discrimination method was able to transform these spatial data, which were multidimensional due to the factors influencing the IGFB, into a one-dimensional function and determine its critical value. Then, by processing the data into a normal distribution, the critical values of the outbursts were analyzed using linear discriminant analysis with Fisher\u2019s criterion. The weak and strong outbursts had critical values of 36.63\u2009L and 80.85\u2009L, respectively, and the accuracy of the back-discriminant analysis for the weak and strong outbursts was 94.74% and 92.86%, respectively.

XRD and DSC measurements confirm that the as-obtained CPEs have amorphous structures. The 80%[50%PIL\u201350%SN]\u201320%LiTFSI (50% SN) electrolyte reveals a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 5.74\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22124 \u00a0S\u00a0cm \u22121 , a wide electrochemical window of 5.5\u00a0V, as well as good mechanical strength with a Youngu0027s modulus of 4.9\u00a0MPa. Li/LiFePO 4  cells assembled with the 50% SN electrolyte at 0.1C rate can deliver a discharge capacity of about 150\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, with excellent capacity retention. Furthermore, such cells are able to achieve stable discharge capacities of 131.8 and 121.2\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  at 0.5C and 1.0C rate, respectively. The impressive findings demonstrate that the electrolyte system prepared in this work has great potential for application in lithium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) has been considered to be a promisingly alternative anode material for lithium-ion batteries and thus attracted wide research interest. But, its practical application in lithium-ion batteries is seriously impeded by low capacity and poor rate capability. In the present work, the electrochemical performance of TiO 2  is significantly improved by elaborately fabricating hierarchical structures. These as-prepared four hierarchical structure TiO 2  assembled by different building blocks (TO 2 -2\u00a0h, TO 2 -6\u00a0h, TO 2 -18\u00a0h and TO 2 -24\u00a0h) all exhibit impressed performance. More importantly, the TO 2 -6\u00a0h constructed by curved nanosheets exhibits the best performance, delivering a capacity of 231.6\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  at 0.2C after 200 cycles, and capacities of 187.1 and 129.3\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  at 1 and 10C after even 1200 cycles, respectively. The results indicated that design and fabrication of hierarchical structure is an effective strategy for significantly improving the electrochemical performance of TiO 2  electrodes, and the electrochemical performance of hierarchical structure TiO 2  is heavily dependent on its building blocks. It is suggested that thus excellent electrochemical performance may make TiO 2 -6\u00a0h a promising anode material for advanced lithium-ion batteries with high capacity, good rate capability and long life.",

The thermal and electrochemical properties of these HIGEs as well as their application in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are investigated. It is found that HIGEs reveal excellent thermal stability, good room temperature ionic conductivity, high electrochemical stability, a suitable lithium ion transference number, and potential to suppress Li dendrite formation. In particular, Li/LiFePO4 cells with the as-obtained HIGE at 0.2C rate can deliver a discharge capacity of about 150 mA h g\u22121 at 25 \u00b0C, with excellent capacity retention. Moreover, at 0.5C, 1.0C, and 2.0C, the stable discharge capacities are as high as 138.1 mA h g\u22121, 120.3 mA h g\u22121 and 73.8 mA h g\u22121, respectively. The desirable battery performance can be attributed to the good electrochemical properties of HIGEs and interfacial compatibility between HIGEs and electrodes. These findings show that HIGEs prepared in this work have great potential for application as safe electrolytes in LMBs.",

For MSM devices with DLC deposited at a substrate bias of \u221250\u2009V, the I-V curves exhibited ohmic electrical behaviors in the range of 0\u20131\u2009V and followed the Poole-Frenkel mechanism in the range of 1\u20135\u2009V. Moreover, the carrier transport was dominated by the thermally activated process with an activation energy of 0.1576\u2009eV in the temperature range of 160\u2013400\u2009K. The bulk-limited behaviors of MSM devices could be attributed to the relatively high bulk resistance of the DLC layer. This result offers the fundamental insight into DLC based electrical devices and brings forward the concept to fabricate functional carbon based materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Amorphous carbon (a-C) films co-doped by two metals exhibit a desirable combination of mechanical and tribological properties for wider applications. Nevertheless, the structural evolution of metal co-doped a-C films from the atomic and electronic scales is a critical pre-requisite to illustrate the intrinsic mechanism of residual stress reduction. Herein, we first fabricated the Ti/Al co-doped a-C films with different concentrations by a hybrid ion beam system. When the co-doped Ti/Al concentrations were  3.9 at.% /Al 4.4 at.% , the Ti and Al atoms were dissolved in the a-C matrix without forming a carbide phase; with the Ti/Al concentrations further increased beyond of Ti 3.9 at.% /Al 4.4 at.% , the crystalline titanium carbide nano-particles appeared, while Al existed in the form of aluminum oxidation state in the films. The residual stress, hardness and elastic modulus of films were strongly dependent on the chemical state of the co-doped Ti/Al atoms, which decreased first and then increased with Ti/Al concentrations. Ab initio calculations revealed that the residual stress reduction in a-C films caused by Ti/Al co-doping was mainly attributed to the significant relaxation of distorted C C bond lengths and the formation of a weak covalent interaction for Ti C bonds and the ionic interaction for Al C bonds.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Co-doping two metal elements into diamond-like carbon (DLC) films can reach the desirable combined properties, but the preparation and commercialized application of metal co-doped DLC films with well-defined structural properties are currently hindered by the non-comprehensive understanding of structural evolutions under different process parameters. Here, we fabricated the Ti/Al-DLC films using a unique hybrid ion beam system which enabled the independent control of metal content and carbon structure. The evolutions of microstructure, residual compressive stress and mechanical properties induced by the different process parameters including sputtering currents, C 2 H 2  or CH 4  source gases and bias voltages were investigated systematically in order to perform in-depth analysis on the relation between the structure and properties in Ti/Al-DLC films. Results revealed that the variations of process parameters seriously affected the concentration and chemical bond state of co-doped Ti/Al atoms in amorphous carbon matrix or incident energies of C ions, which brought the complicated effect on amorphous carbon structures, accounting for the change of residual compressive stress, hardness and toughness. The present results provide the guidance for suitable, effective parameters selection to tailor the Ti/Al-DLC films with high performance for further applications.",

The Cu concentration (from 0.1 to 39.7\u00a0at.%) in the Cu-DLC films was controlled by varying the sputtering current. The dependence of residual stress, microstructure and atomic bond structure upon Cu concentration was investigated systematically. Results indicated that the nanoscale Cu particles began to evolve from the carbon matrix in the Cu concentration range of 2.6\u20137.0\u00a0at.%. The residual stress of the Cu-DLC films (less than 0.60\u00a0GPa) showed a significant reduction compared with that of the pure carbon film (2.0\u00a0GPa). Theoretical calculations revealed that the formation of antibonding between Cu and C and the relaxation of distorted bond angles and bond length accounted for the significant reduction of residual stress caused by Cu incorporation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films with weak carbide metal Al and carbide metal Ti co-doping (Al/Ti-DLC) were prepared by a hybrid ion beam deposition system. The atomic ratios of doped Al to Ti were tailored via designing the special Al/Ti combined sputtering target. The composition, microstructure, roughness, residual stress, hardness, toughness, and tribological behaviors of the deposited films were systematically evaluated to explore the dependence of structural properties on Al/Ti ratios. Results indicated that the high-throughput preparation of DLC films with different Al/Ti atomic ratios was achieved by tailoring the sputtering target and process parameters without the difference in both the film thickness and total Al/Ti content. With the Al/Ti ratios in the films decreased from 8.8 to 3.0, the residual stress, hardness, and toughness of Al/Ti-DLC films increased obviously, originating from the increased fraction of titanium carbide and the reduced Al content. However, the coefficient of friction and wear rate with decreasing the Al/Ti ratio were obviously improved, which was related with the transformation of underlying friction mechanism from the sliding interface graphitization to dangling bond-passivation. The present results not only suggest a high-throughput method to fabricate co-doped DLC films, but also promote the scientific understanding and engineering application of DLC films with high performance.",

The effects of deposition temperature on the metal content, hardness and wear behavior of Cu/Cr-DLC films were investigated. Particularly, an optical emission spectroscopy was applied to characterize the plasma at different deposition temperatures. Results showed that the intensities of Cu and Cr spectral lines decreased dramatically as the temperature increased from 60 to 250\u202f\u00b0C. The concentrations of Cu and Cr decreased from 18.1 to 2.7\u202fat.% and 10.5 to 2.2\u202fat.%, respectively. Meanwhile, high temperature promoted the formation of the Cr carbide phase, which was beneficial to achieve high hardness of the film. Although the residual stress increased with the rise of deposition temperature, the Cu/Cr-DLC film showed a better adhesive strength in comparison with pure amorphous carbon film. The wear resistance was also significantly improved at high deposition temperature, and only faint wear was observed when the temperature was above 150\u202f\u00b0C. The excellent tribological performance of Cu/Cr-DLC film was mainly attributed to good mechanical properties and the formation of continuously compacted graphitized transfer film under dry sliding conditions.",

        "abstract": "Amorphous carbon films (a-C) co-doped by two metal elements exhibit the desirable combination of tribological and mechanical properties for widely potential applications, but are also prone to catastrophic failure due to the inevitable residual compressive stress. Thus far, the residual stress reduction mechanism remains unclear due to the insufficient understanding of the structure from the atomic and electronic scale. In this paper, using ab initio calculations, we firstly designed a novel Cu/Cr co-doped a-C film and demonstrated that compared with pure and Cu/Cr mono-doped cases, the residual stress in Cu/Cr co-doped a-C films could be reduced by 93.6% remarkably. Atomic bond structure analysis revealed that the addition of Cu and Cr impurities in amorphous carbon structure resulted in the critical and significant relaxation of distorted C-C bond lengths. On the other hand, electronic structure calculation indicated a weak bonding interaction between the Cr and C atoms, while the antibonding interaction was observed for the Cu-C bonds, which would play a pivot site for the release of strain energy. Those interactions combined with the structural evolution could account for the drastic residual stress reduction caused by Cu/Cr co-doping. Our results provide the theoretical guidance and desirable strategy to design and fabricate a new nanocomposite a-C films with combined properties for renewed applications.",

The effect of Cu/Cr co-doping on wettability and mechanical properties of DLC films were focused. The resultant Cu/Cr-DLC films were shown to afford good hydrophobicity and superior mechanical performance. In particular, the film with Cu 11.88% Cr 6.57%  (at.%) exhibited a relatively high water contact angle of 103.6\u00b0, lower residual stress of 0.89\u00a0GPa and high hardness of 13.44\u00a0GPa. The combined structural analysis demonstrated that the synergistic Cu/Cr co-doping resulted in the critical and significant relaxation of distorted C C bond length, which ultimately caused the reduction in residual stress. Due to the formation of hard Cr carbide nano-particles in amorphous carbon matrix, the films maintained the high value of hardness. In addition, noted that the interesting wetting variety from hydrophilic to hydrophobic state was attributed to the enhanced surface graphitization and emergence of copper oxidation phases, and the film topographical microstructure could also promote the hydrophobicity of film when the maximum height of roughness was in a certain range. These results provide an expected robust synthesis method to make DLC film a promising protective coating for long lasting hydrophobic application and related harsh fields.",

And a comparative study on structure and wetting properties of W-DLC and Cu-DLC films was focused. For Cu-DLC films, the wettability transformation from hydrophilicity (76.56\u00b0) to hydrophobicity (105.6\u00b0) was observed. While in case of W-DLC films, the wettability of films maintained the hydrophilicity (73.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.93\u00b0) within the presented W concentration. Based on the surface energy calculation and electronic structure analysis from first-principles calculations, we firstly gained insight into the wettability behavior of W-DLC and Cu-DLC films in terms of the bond characteristics formed between doped metal and C atoms. Results showed that the anti-bonding characteristic between Cu and C atoms reduced the polar components of surface energy and dangling bonds, contributing to the improvement of hydrophobic property, while the non-bonding characteristic for W C bond resulted in the appearance of dipoles, leading to the hydrophilic character. It was in particularly concluded that the different bond characteristic between metal and C atoms played a key role in the wettability of metal doped DLC films. The obtained results offer a facile strategy to design DLC films with tailored wettability properties for the promising hydrophobic applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Co-doping two metals into diamond-like carbon (DLC) films exhibits a desirable combination of low residual stress and hard hardness for further application, but the insight into tribological mechanism induced by the co-doped metals is still not fully clarified yet. In this work, we fabricated the Ti/Al co-doped DLC films (Ti/Al-DLC) with various metal concentrations using the hybrid ion beam system, and the tribological properties of films were systematically investigated. Results revealed that the co-doped Ti/Al metals played an important role in the tribological behaviors of DLC films; the film deposited at 2.5\u202fA (Ti 10.06at.% Al 4.78at.% ) exhibited the lowest friction coefficient of about 0.05 and wear rate of 1.56\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 \u221216 \u202fm 3 \u202fN \u22121 \u202fm \u22121 . This attributed to the formation of thick transfer layer in the friction interface, which could be described as a dual or hierarchy nanostructure constructed of cross-linking amorphous carbon networks and hard phase (mainly TiC and Al 2 O 3 ) structures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Compositing amorphous carbon (a-C) film with fluid lubricant could successfully improve the friction properties and prolong the service life and reliability of protected components. However, the inevitable existence of unsaturated molecules in base oil, especially its potential effect on the friction behavior and related mechanism are still not fully understood. In this paper, the friction behavior of amorphous carbon (a-C) composited with unsaturated hydrocarbon lubricant, C 5 H 10  as one of linear alpha olefins (AO), was explored by reactive molecular dynamics simulation, and the role of C 5 H 10  content on friction property and interfacial structure was mainly analyzed. Results revealed that at the fixed contact pressure, the unsaturated C 5 H 10  bound with a-C in the form of weak intermolecular interactions rather than chemical bonding and there was also no C 5 H 10  dissociation observed; the friction coefficient was strongly dependent on the small unsaturated hydrocarbon, which decreased obviously with C 5 H 10  content. In particular, compared to the dry condition, the existence of C 5 H 10  molecules at the friction interface could significantly reduce the friction coefficient by 99.2% maximally. By the systematical analysis of interfacial hybridization structure and AO mobility, it indicated that the synergistic mechanism for the low friction originated from the self-passivation of a-C surface and AO hydrodynamic lubrication. Our results not only disclose the effect of unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules in bas oil on friction behavior and define the underlying lubrication mechanism, but also suggest a strategy for the design of both fluid lubricant and friction interface to realize the long-lifetime application.",

Results showed that the total energy in TM\u2013C systems caused by distorting the bond angles was reduced distinctly for comparison with that in C\u2013C system. Further electronic structure revealed that as the 3d electrons of doped TM increased, the bond characteristic of highest occupied molecular orbital changed from bonding (Sc, Ti) to nonbonding (V, Cr, Mn, Fe) and finally to antibonding (Co, Ni, Cu) between the TM and C atoms. Meanwhile, the TM\u2013C bond presented a mixture of the covalent and ionic characters. The decrease of strength and directionality of TM\u2013C bonds resulted in the total energy change upon bond angle distortion, which demonstrated that the bond characteristics played an important role in reducing residual stress of TM-doped amorphous carbon systems.",

The effect of substrate bias on the microstructure and property of amorphous carbon films were mainly investigated. The results show that the electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance are improved significantly for the carbon films coated stainless steel in comparison to the untreated ones. Specifically, when the substrate bias was -200 V the contact resistance was about 16.65 mOmega\u00b7cm~2, which may be ascribed to the highest fraction of sp~2 bonds under the normal compacting force of the fuel cells at 1.5 MPa. The corrosion potential of the carbon films coated stainless steel significantly increased in the simulated PEM fuel cells environment, while the corrosion current density obviously decreased, especially when the bias was - 200 V the carbon film performs the best corrosion resistance, which may be attributed to its best compactness, for this case the corrosion current density is 1.22*10~(-8) A/cm~2 and the corrosion potential is 0.25 V.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The dependence of friction behaviors of the self-mated a-C system on sliding velocity,  v , and contact pressure,  P , was investigated systematically by reactive molecular dynamics simulation. Results demonstrated that the friction coefficient and sp 3 -to-sp 2  transformation of interfacial structure were more sensitive to the contact pressure than the sliding velocity. By analyzing the relation of friction coefficient and interfacial hybridization structure with  P/v  ratio, it suggested that the low friction coefficient, which was accompanied by the low sp 2  fraction, was strongly dependent on the passivation of friction interface as the primary mechanism. These findings disclose the proof for passivation mechanism mentioned in previous experiments, and also provide the potential strategy to fabricate new nanocomposite a-C films by surface/interface modification for tribo-applications.",

The hybridization and the distributions of both bond angles and lengths as a function of the three potentials were analyzed, and the density and residual stress were calculated. Results revealed that comparing with the Tersoff and REBO potentials, the AIREBO potential gave the more reasonable values of density, hybridization ratio and residual stress. This attributed to that in AIREBO potential, the conjugation effect between the different coordinated atoms was corrected by revising the bond order term, which was responsible for the sp 3  content; while the introduction of long-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction described the compressed graphite structure correctly following the rational density; in particular, both the LJ and torsion interactions were indispensable for the accurate evaluation of residual stress of a-C films. In addition, the simulation result using AIREBO potential suggested no dependence on the processing methods of atom-by-atom deposition and liquid-quenching method.",

In order to improve toughness without significantly sacrificing hardness, here we designed the V-Al-C-N nanocomposite coatings, and the microstructures consisting of V-based nanocrystalline hard phases and sp 2 -riched amorphous carbon soft phases were successfully manipulated by sputtering V 2 AlC target under various N 2  flow rates. Results indicated that the coating hardness was almost independent on the N 2  flow rate and maintained around ~\u00a030\u00a0GPa as changing N 2  flow rate from 5 to 20\u00a0sccm, while the toughness was significantly improved, and the high H/E ratio of 0.11 and elastic recovery of 69% could be obtained, respectively. In addition, the V-Al-C-N nanocomposite coatings showed low wear rate ( \u2212\u00a016 \u00a0m 3 /Nm) under a normal load of 10\u00a0N. The hard yet tough characteristic and high wear resistance for the deposited coatings were attributed to the special nanocomposite microstructures as well as the synergistic lubricant effect derived from both sp 2 -riched amorphous carbon and V 2 O 5  Magneli phases formed during friction stage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ti 2 AlN belongs to a family of ternary nano-laminate alloys known as the MAX phases, which exhibit a unique combination of metallic and ceramic properties. In the present work, the dense and high-stability Ti 2 AlN coating has been successfully prepared through the combined cathodic arc/sputter deposition, followed by heat post-treatment. It was found that the as-deposited Ti-Al-N coating behaved a multilayer structure, where (Ti, N)-rich layer and Al-rich layer grew alternately, with a mixed phase constitution of TiN and TiAl  x  . After annealing at 800\u00a0\u00b0C under vacuum condition for 1.5\u00a0h, although the multilayer structure still was found, part of multilayer interfaces became indistinct and disappeared. In particular, the thickness of the Al-rich layer decreased in contrast to that of as-deposited coating due to the inner diffusion of the Al element. Moreover, the Ti 2 AlN MAX phase emerged as the major phase in the annealed coatings and its formation mechanism was also discussed in this study. The vacuum thermal analysis indicated that the formed Ti 2 AlN MAX phase exhibited a high-stability, which was mainly benefited from the large thickness and the dense structure. This advanced technique based on the combined cathodic arc/sputter method could be extended to deposit other MAX phase coatings with tailored high performance like good thermal stability, high corrosion and oxidation resistance etc. for the next protective coating materials.",

A discharge state transition in the glow discharge stage happened at high pulse voltage and working pressure conditions. Furthermore, the dependence of reduced cathode fall thickness pdc on pulse voltage, working pressure, and normalized current density j/p2 was presented.

The linear kinetics composed of two stages is observed for each case, suggesting a chemical reaction determining process, and the second stage behaves a slightly higher oxidation rate. In air, the oxidation behavior exhibits an inhomogeneous oxidation due to the presence of macro-particles and impurity phases in the coating, while a transition from inhomogeneous oxidation to homogeneous oxidation occurs in pure steam. Compared to that in air, the oxidation process in pure steam is accelerated, leading to higher mass gains. XRD and EDX analyses indicate that Al easily diffuses to the surface and thus forms \u03b1-Al 2 O 3  layer under the two atmospheres, which result from the high Al activity within MAX phase. Additionally, the scaling mechanism of Ti 2 AlN coatings is discussed in terms of the microstructure evolution.",

In this work, we fabricated Cr/GLC multilayered films with different modulation period on the 316L stainless steel by direct current magnetron sputtering. Tribocorrosion tests in artificial seawater show that the tribocorrosion resistance of the Cr/GLC films is improved as the modulation period decreases from 1000 to 333 nm, and then drastically drops with further decreasing to 250 nm. By taking top-layer thickening strategy for the Cr/GLC film with 250 nm modulation period, the tribocorrosion performance was significantly enhanced.

The effect of Cr/GLC modulation ratio on microstructure, mechanical and tribological properties in artificial seawater was mainly investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), nano-indenter and a reciprocating sliding tribo-meter. The propagation of defects plays an important role in the evolution of delamination, which is critical to wear failure of GLC films in artificial seawater. Designing the proper multilayer structure could inhibit the defects propagation and thus protect the basis material.

        "abstract": "Summary   Using spherically directed reduction of metal ions, a facile and universal method for  in situ  crosslinking of DNA micelles is described. By incorporating a series of specific template domains into lipid-DNA monomers, copper-, silver-, and gold-crosslinked DNA micelles are formed. By combining characterization results and simulation algorithms, accurate structural profiling of DNA micelles is achieved for the first time. The prepared metal-crosslinked DNA micelles show obvious merits, including one-step formation of core structure and ligand corona, facile size tunability, monodispersity, stability against salt-induced aggregation, high utilization of DNA ligand, mild synthesis conditions, and less time consumption and better internalization. Based on our spherically directed synthesis, metal-crosslinked DNA micelle flares were further prepared for effective intracellular imaging by integrating an aptamer-toehold strategy. In addition, we extended the strategy to cholesterol-based double-stranded DNA micelles, giving strong evidence that our method is not only universal but also flexible.",

        "abstract": "The specific binding ability of DNA-lipid micelles (DLMs) can be increased by the introduction of an aptamer. However, supramolecular micellar structures based on self-assemblies of amphiphilic DLMs are expected to demonstrate low stability when interacting with cell membranes under certain conditions, which could lead to a reduction in selectivity for targeting cancer cells. We herein report a straightforward cross-linking strategy that relies on a methacrylamide branch to link aptamer and lipid segments. By an efficient photoinduced polymerization process, covalently linked aptamer-lipid units help stabilize the micelle structure and enhance aptamer probe stability, further improving the targeting ability of the resulting nanoassembly. Besides the development of a facile cross-linking method, this study clarifies the relationship between aptamer-lipid concentration and the corresponding binding ability.",

We herein constructed a new DNA aptamer-grafted photoresponsive hyperbranched polymer, which can self-assemble into nanoparticles, thereby achieving biocompatibility and target specificity, as well as light-controllable release behavior. Upon UV-irradiation, rapid release induced by disassembly was observed for Nile Red-loaded nanoparticles. Further in vitro cell studies confirmed this delivery system's specific binding and internalization performance arising from the DNA aptamer corona. The DOX-loaded nanoassembly exhibited selective phototriggered cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, indicating its promising therapeutic effect as a \"smart\" drug delivery system.",

        "abstract": "Introgression frequently occurs between closely related plant species when there is incomplete reproductive isolation. However, few studies have been designed to examine the extent and direction of introgression from all three genomes, especially when they have different rates of gene flow. Conifers, in which chloroplast (cp), mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear (nr) genomes show contrasting rates of gene flow, provide a good model in which to carry out such a case study. Here we use data on sequence variation in 18 DNAs from three genomes for 311 individuals of 31 populations to investigate the extent and direction of introgressions between three spruce species in areas where they are sympatrically distributed. We found that one species seem to have introgressions derived from the other two species in areas of sympatric distribution; there were more introgressions from the maternally inherited mtDNA, which has the lowest rate of gene flow, and fewer introgressions from the bi-parentally inherited nrDNA. Further coalescent analysis of nrDNA population genetic data suggested that the species containing introgressions had experienced range expansion in the recent past while there was no such indication for the other two species. Our results support the hypotheses that introgressions occurred more frequently at genetic markers with lower rates of gene flow and that they usually took place from local species towards invading species that had undergone recent demographic expansion.",

        "abstract": "Currently, functional single-stranded oligonucleotide probes, termed aptamers, generated by an iterative technology, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), are utilized to selectively target molecules or cells with high affinity. Aptamers hold considerable promise as multifunctional molecules or conjugates for challenging nanotechnologies or bioapplications now and in the future. In this review, we first describe recent endeavors to select aptamers towards live cancer cells via cell-SELEX. We then introduce several characteristic applications of selected aptamers, especially in imaging, drug delivery and therapy. In part, these advances have been made possible via synthesis of aptamer-based nanomaterials, which, by their sizes, shapes, and physicochemical properties, allow such aptamer-nanomaterial complexes to function as signal reporters or drug carriers. We also describe how these aptamer-based molecular tools contribute to cancer biomarker discovery through high-affinity recognition of membrane protein receptors.",

        "abstract": "Tau proteins are proteins that stabilize microtubules, but their hyperphosphorylation can result in the formation of protein aggregates and, over time, neurodegeneration. This phenomenon, termed tauopathy, is pathologically involved in several neurodegenerative disorders. DNA aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides capable of specific binding to target molecules. Using tau epitopes predisposed for phosphorylation, we identified 6 distinct aptamers that bind to tau at two phosphorylatable epitopes (Thr-231 and Ser-202) and to full-length Tau441 proteins with nanomolar affinity. In addition, several of these aptamers also inhibit tau phosphorylation (IT4, IT5, IT6) and tau oligomerization (IT3, IT4, IT5, IT6). This is the first report to identify tau epitope-specific aptamers. Such tau aptamers can be used to detect tau in biofluids and uncover the mechanism of tauopathy. They can be further developed into novel therapeutic agents in mitigating tauopathy-associated neurodegenerative disorders.\u2003.",

        "abstract": "Aptamers that recognize specific cells in a complex environment have emerged as invaluable molecular tools in bioanalysis and in the development of targeted therapeutics. The selective recognition of aptamers, however, can be compromised by the coexistence of target receptors on both target cells and other cells. To address this problem, we constructed a structure-switchable aptamer (SW-Apt) with reconfigurable binding affinity in accordance with the microenvironment of target cells. The SW-Apt makes use of i-motifs, which are quadruplex structures that form in sequences rich in cytosine. More specifically, we report the design of single-stranded, pH-responsive i-motif-modified aptamers able to bind specifically with target cells by exploiting their pH. Here, the i-motif serves as a structural domain to either facilitate the binding ability of aptamers to target cells, or to suppress the binding ability of aptamers to nontarget cell based on the pH of the cellular microenvironment. SW-Apt exhibited high binding ability with target cells at acidic pH, while no obvious binding was observed at physiological pH. The i-motif-induced structure-switching was verified with FRET and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Notably, SW-Apt exhibits high specificity in serum and excellent stability, likely attributed to the folded quadruplex i-motif structure. This study provides a simple and efficient strategy to chemically modulate ap-tamer binding ability and thus improve aptamer binding specificity to target cells, irrespective of the coexistence of identical recep-tors on target and nontarget cells.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Novel magnetically separable BiOBr/NiFe 2 O 4  composite photocatalysts with different mass ratios were fabricated through a facile hydrothermal treatment. The phases, morphologies and photophysical properties of the as-obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microcopy (TEM) and diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS). Their visible light photocatalytic performances were examined by degradation of methylene blue (MB) and phenol. Compared with bare BiOBr and NiFe 2 O 4 , all heterostructured BiOBr/NiFe 2 O 4  nanocomposites exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. The BiOBr/NiFe 2 O 4 -20% composite showed the highest photodegradation capacity, which was about 3.2 and 22.4 times greater than that of individual BiOBr and NiFe 2 O 4 , respectively. The degradation efficiency of BiOBr/NiFe 2 O 4 -20% in the degradation of MB dye hardly changed after five cycles, signifying that the BiOBr/NiFe 2 O 4 -20% photocatalyst had excellent recyclability. In addition, BiOBr/NiFe 2 O 4  composite photocatalysts could be easily separated from contaminant solution by using a magnet and recycled, exhibiting great potential for application in the fields of environmental purification of organic pollutants and wastewater treatment. In the light of experimental results, we proposed a photocatalytic mechanism which confirmed that the enhancement of photocatalytic performance for BiOBr/NiFe 2 O 4  composites was mainly ascribed to the efficient separation of photo-induced charges resulting from the well-known \u201cheterostructure effect\u201d between NiFe 2 O 4  nanorods and BiOBr nanosheets.",

The structure of as-synthesized magnetically recyclable BiOBr/NiFe 2 O 4  (denoted as BOB/NFO) composite samples consisting of different BOB/NFO mass ratios was fully characterized and the photocatalytic performance was also detailedly evaluated through degrading rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light. BOB/NFO10 (10% NFO) composite photocatalyst represented the highest catalytic efficiency, degrading 99.8% of RhB after 30\u202fmin of irradiation. The rate constant of degradation was almost 1.72 and 60.3 times as high as those of the bare BiOBr and NiFe 2 O 4 , respectively, which should be ascribed to the efficient charge separation and transfer originating from heterostructure between BOB and NFO.

As is well known, images reconstructed by CII suffer from artifacts and, as a result, degradation of visual quality. As solutions to this problem, the regularization and iterative back-projection (IBP)-based super-resolution (SR) reconstruction algorithms have been shown to be effective for high-visual-quality reconstruction. However, computation of the regularization algorithm is very expensive, and the IBP algorithm is very sensitive to noise in the deblurring process. To address these challenges, we propose an iterative perfect reconstruction algorithm that addresses the issues of low visual quality and noise sensitivity. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms the conventional SR reconstruction-based CII methods.",

        "abstract": "The interest in a three-dimensional (3-D) holographic display is increasing daily because it can generate full depth cue without utilizing any special glasses. However, the content of 3-D holographic videos currently without any protection can be illegally distributed and maliciously manipulated. Therefore, there is an urgent need to protect the copyright of holographic videos against malicious copying. Since watermarking is an effective way to protect the ownership of holographic sequence, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal consistent embedding algorithm for the holographic video watermarking. Imperceptibility requirement in the holographic video watermarking is more challenging compared with static holograms because of the temporal dimension existing in videos. The embedding algorithm should not only consider spatially embedding strength for each frame of the video, but also take the temporal dimension into account in order to guarantee the visual quality of the moving object. Before embedding, to defend the imperceptibility of the watermark from the holographic moving object, the embedding parameters are evaluated by the salient object from the interframe and intraframe. Different from the previous video watermarking algorithm, in order to ensure the robustness, in our paper, instead of two-dimensional watermark, 3-D watermark converted data (QR code) are embedded in the cellular automata (CA) domains using 3-D CA filters. Finally, the QR codes can be extracted from the watermarked holographic frames, and the final 3-D watermark can be digitally reconstructed with different depths\u2019 cue using the computational integral imaging reconstruction algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to several methods in the literature, especially the robustness against additive noise and compression attacks.",

However, color crosstalk exists in CFA that diminishes color gamut, resulting in the reduced resolution. In this paper, we present a monospectral II encryption approach with a monospectral camera array (MCA). The monospectral II system captures images with the MCA that can eliminate color crosstalk among the adjacent spectral channels. It is noteworthy that the captured elemental images (EIs) from the colored scene belong to grayscale; the colored image encryption is converted to grayscale encryption. Consequently, this study will significantly save the calculation load in image encoding and decoding (nearly reduced 2/3) compared with the similar works. Afterwards, an optimized super-resolution reconstruction algorithm is introduced to improve the viewing resolution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A double color image encryption scheme based on off-axis holography and maximum length cellular automata (MLCA) is proposed. The original image is separated into three channels: red, green, and blue, and each channel is independently encrypted by using MLCA mask to make the intensity values change in the spatial domain. Then the reference waves with different incident angles are introduced into the off-axis Fourier transform hologram to accomplish double color image encryption. The system parameters of the off-axis Fourier transform in each channel are also keys in image encryption and decryption. When we want to decrypt one of the original images, the reference wave with certain incident angle and corresponding MLCA mask are used. Some numerical simulations have demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and we present the results of our preliminary experiments.",

        "abstract": "The traditional Chinese medicine Jinfukang (JFK) has been shown as a valuable drug to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previously, it was reported that JFK-induced epigenetic alteration is involved in anti-lung cancer activity. In the present study, the effect of JFK on lung cancer cell lines was examined with the aim to further understand the underlying mechanisms of JFK-induced anti-lung cancer activity by transcriptome profiling analysis. JFK was observed to decrease lung cancer cell viability and simultaneously induce cellular morphology alteration. Additionally, this causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in A549 cells. The present RNA-seq analysis identified 5,281 genes with differential expression (P<0.05). Gene ontology analysis indicated that genes involved in the cell cycle pathway are downregulated, including cyclin-dependent kinase 2, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, cyclin B1 and cyclin A2, and apoptosis-associated genes are upregulated, including , death receptor 4 (), tumor protein P53 binding protein 2 and BCL2 interacting protein 3 like. Particularly, the present results indicate knockdown of  and  attenuates JFK-induced apoptosis in A549 cells. Overall, the present study suggests JFK induces cellular apoptosis through activation of  and  in A549 cells and provides an insight for understanding the antitumor mechanisms of this Chinese traditional medicine.",

        "abstract": "In controlling biological diseases, it is often more potent to use a combination of agents than using individual ones. However, the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the number of agents and their concentrations. It is prohibitive to search for effective agent combinations by trial and error as biological systems are complex and their responses to agents are often a slow process. This motivates to build a suitable model to describe the biological systems and help reduce the number of experiments. In this paper, we consider the use of fungicides to inhibit Bipolaris maydis and construct models that describe the responses to fungicide combinations. Three data-driven modeling methods, the polynomial regression, the artificial neural network and the support vector regression, are compared based on the experimental data of the inhibition rates of the southern corn leaf blight with different fungicide combinations. The analysis of the results demonstrates that the support vector regression is best suited to the construction of the response model in terms of achieving better prediction with fewer experiments.",

        "abstract": "The metabolome changes of Campylobacter jejuni with resistant gene ermB remain unclear. Here, we described an untargeted metabolomic workflow based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry to investigate the metabolites perturbations mediated by ermB in C. jejuni. After optimization of extractants and chromatographic conditions, the combination of 100% methanol extraction with a 12\u202fmin gradient by C18 column was adopted for untargeted metabolomic profiling in reversed phase separation. Meanwhile, 60% methanol extraction followed by a 14\u202fmin separation using hydrophilic interaction chromatography column was suitable to complementally expand the metabolite coverage of C. jejuni. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed by means of orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis to select metabolic features. The selected features were further confirmed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. A total of thirty-six differential metabolites between the susceptible strain (C. jejuni NCTC 11168) and resistant stain (C. jejuni NCTC 11168 with ermB) were identified. These pivotal metabolites were primarily participated in biological processes as cell signaling, membrane integrity/stability, fuel and energy source/storage and nutrient. The biofilm formation capability of resistant strain was inferior to that of susceptible strain, confirming the influence of ermB on membrane integrity/stability of C. jejuni. Our findings revealed important metabolic regulatory pathways associated with resistant C. jejuni with ermB.",

The proposed method applies a solid-phase extraction procedure with Oasis PRiME HLB cartridges that combines isolation of the compounds and sample clean-up in a single step. Analysis is performed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, in one single injection with a chromatographic run time of only 9.5min. Linearity was studied in the range between 1 and 500\u03bcgkg using standards prepared both in pure solvent and in the presence of matrix, showing coefficients of determination higher than 0.99 for all the analytes except for cefapirin in matrix. The average recoveries were in the range of 60-110% for most of the compounds tested with inter-day relative standard deviations below 17%. More than 97% of the investigated compounds had less or equal to a 5\u03bcgkg quantitation limit in the studied matrix. Finally, the method was used with success to detect and quantify veterinary drugs residues in real samples with sulfonamides, quinolones, and tetracyclines being the most frequently determined compound groups.",

As a result, the samples were extracted with Mcllvaine and phosphate buffers, followed by clean-up step based on solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB cartridge. All compounds were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry, in one single injection with a chromatographic run time of only 9\u00a0min. The method efficiency was evaluated in 5 tissues including muscle, liver, and kidney, and the mean recoveries ranged from 54% to 102%, with inter-day relative standard deviation lower than 14%. The limits of quantification were between 0.5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, which were satisfactory to support future surveillance monitoring. The developed method was applied to the analysis of swine liver and chicken samples from local markets, and sulfamethazine was the most commonly detected compound in the animal samples, with the highest residue level of 998\u00a0\u03bcg/kg.",

        "abstract": "The optrA gene, which confers transferable resistance to oxazolidinones and phenicols, is defined as an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter but lacks transmembrane domains. The resistance mechanism of optrA and whether it involves antibiotic efflux or ribosomal protection remain unclear. In this study, we determined the MIC values of all bacterial strains by broth microdilution, and used ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry to quantitatively determine the intracellular concentrations of linezolid and florfenicol in Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Linezolid and florfenicol both accumulated in susceptible strains and optrA-carrying strains of E. faecalis and S. aureus. No significant differences were observed in the patterns of drug accumulation among E. faecalis JH2-2, E. faecalis JH2-2/pAM401, and E. faecalis JH2-2/pAM401+optrA, but also among S. aureus RN4220, S. aureus RN4220/pAM401, and S. aureus RN4220/pAM401+optrA. ANOVA scores also suggested similar accumulation conditions of the two target compounds in susceptible strains and optrA-carrying strains. Based on our findings, the mechanism of optrA-mediated resistance to oxazolidinones and phenicols obviously does not involve active efflux and the OptrA protein does not confer resistance via efflux like other ABC transporters.",

        "abstract": "T cell therapies require the removal and culture of T cells ex vivo to expand several thousand-fold. However, these cells often lose the phenotype and cytotoxic functionality for mediating effective therapeutic responses. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has been used to preserve and augment cell phenotype; however, it has not been applied to cellular immunotherapies. Here, a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel is engineered to present the two stimulatory signals required for T-cell activation-termed an artificial T-cell stimulating matrix (aTM). It is found that biophysical properties of the aTM-stimulatory ligand density, stiffness, and ECM proteins-potentiate T cell signaling and skew phenotype of both murine and human T cells. Importantly, the combination of the ECM environment and mechanically sensitive TCR signaling from the aTM results in a rapid and robust expansion of rare, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Adoptive transfer of these tumor-specific cells significantly suppresses tumor growth and improves animal survival compared with T cells stimulated by traditional methods. Beyond immediate immunotherapeutic applications, demonstrating the environment influences the cellular therapeutic product delineates the importance of the ECM and provides a case study of how to engineer ECM-mimetic materials for therapeutic immune stimulation in the future.",

        "abstract": "Soft tissue losses from tumor removal, trauma, aging, and congenital malformation affect millions of people each year. Existing options for soft tissue restoration have several drawbacks: Surgical options such as the use of autologous tissue flaps lead to donor site defects, prosthetic implants are prone to foreign body response leading to fibrosis, and fat grafting and dermal fillers are limited to small-volume defects and only provide transient volume restoration. In addition, large-volume fat grafting and other tissue-engineering attempts are hampered by poor vascular ingrowth. Currently, there are no off-the-shelf materials that can fill the volume lost in soft tissue defects while promoting early angiogenesis. Here, we report a nanofiber-hydrogel composite that addresses these issues. By incorporating interfacial bonding between electrospun poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) fibers and a hyaluronic acid hydrogel network, we generated a composite that mimics the microarchitecture and mechanical properties of soft tissue extracellular matrix. Upon subcutaneous injection in a rat model, this composite permitted infiltration of host macrophages and conditioned them into the pro-regenerative phenotype. By secreting pro-angiogenic cytokines and growth factors, these polarized macrophages enabled gradual remodeling and replacement of the composite with vascularized soft tissue. Such host cell infiltration and angiogenesis were also observed in a rabbit model for repairing a soft tissue defect filled with the composite. This injectable nanofiber-hydrogel composite augments native tissue regenerative responses, thus enabling durable soft tissue restoration outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Current approaches to derive oligodendrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) need extended exposure of hPSCs to growth factors and small molecules, which limits their clinical application because of the lengthy culture time required and low generation efficiency of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Compared to extrinsic growth factors and molecules, oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation can be more effectively modulated by regulation of the cell transcription network. In the developing central nervous system (CNS), two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, Olig1 and Olig2, are decisive in oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. Olig2 plays a critical role in the specification of oligodendrocytes and Olig1 is crucial in promoting oligodendrocyte maturation. Recently viral vectors have been used to overexpress Olig2 and Olig1 in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) to induce the maturation of oligodendrocytes and enhance the remyelination activity in vivo. Because of the safety issues with viral vectors, including the insertional mutagenesis and potential tumor formation, non-viral transfection methods are preferred for clinical translation. Here we report a poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE)-based nanoparticle transfection method to deliver Olig1 and Olig2 into human fetal tissue-derived NSCs and demonstrate efficient oligodendrocyte differentiation following transgene expression of Olig1 and Olig2. This approach is potentially translatable for engineering stem cells to treat injured or diseased CNS tissues. Statement of Significance Current protocols to derive oligodendrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) require lengthy culture time with low generation efficiencies of mature oligodendrocytes. We described a new approach to enhance oligodendrocyte differentiation through nanoparticle-mediated transcription modulation. We tested an effective transfection method using cell-compatible poly (\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE)/DNA nanoparticles as gene carrier to deliver transcription factor Olig1 and Olig2 into human fetal tissue-derived neural stem/progenitor cells, and showed efficient oligodendrocyte differentiation following transgene expression of Olig1 and Olig2. We believe that this translatable approach can be applied to many other cell-based regenerative therapies as well.",

Engineering astrocytes to functional neurons or oligodendrocytes may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for CNS diseases and injuries. Such direct cellular programming has been successfully demonstrated using viral vectors via the transduction of transcriptional factors, such as Sox2, which could program resident astrocytes into neurons in the adult brain and spinal cord, albeit the efficiency was low. Here we report a non-viral nanoparticle-based transfection method to deliver Sox2 or Olig2 into primary human astrocytes and demonstrate the effective conversion of the astrocytes into neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitors following the transgene expression of Sox2 and Olig2, respectively.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Combining thermoacoustic concepts with free piston Stirling systems, this paper puts forward a resonance tube-coupled duplex Stirling cooler which is thermally driven. The novel configuration consists of a free piston Stirling engine, a free piston Stirling cooler and a resonance tube to couple them. Possessing advantages of high exergy efficiency, high reliability and simple structure, it serves as a promising candidate for small scale natural gas liquefaction by burning a small part of natural gas to liquefy the rest and long lifetime space coolers. Using the off-the-shelf components in our laboratory, an experimental setup has been built and a no-load temperature of 110\u00a0K\u00a0has been achieved. As the feasibility of the concept has been verified experimentally, further calculation was done to explore the potential of the configuration. Based on Sage software, the engine and the cooler subsystem were optimized respectively, then a system level numeric model was established and the performance of the system was studied. Among the numeric results, a heat-to-cooling-power exergy efficiency of 26.8% and a cooling power of 2.4\u00a0kW were obtained at 110\u00a0K with an inner diameter 60\u00a0mm resonance tube, charging pressure of 6\u00a0MPa, hot temperature of 923\u00a0K, ambient temperature of 303\u00a0K, working frequency of 75\u00a0Hz.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A free-piston Stirling cryocooler (FPSC) with a large cooling capacity (i.e., from several hundred Watt to thousand Watt) at liquid nitrogen temperature is promising in boil-off gas recondensation and high temperature superconducting (HTS) applications. Based on thermoacoustics, this work focuses on revealing the intrinsic relationship between the internal acoustic field and cooling performance of a FPSC. The main phase shifting parameters including the moving mass of the displacer, regenerator porosity and operating frequency are systematically studied through simulation and experiment. The results indicate that the increase of displacer moving mass has limited effect on the acoustic impedance match between the cooler and the linear compressor, while the exergy loss in the regenerator will decrease dramatically due to the variation of volume flow rate therein. In contrast, the acoustic impedance match is sensitive to the regenerator porosity, and a higher regenerator porosity leads to a considerable thermal ineffectiveness loss in the regenerator and thus degrades the cooler efficiency. In addition, the acoustic field of the FPSC is strongly influenced by the operating frequency. For a fixed cooling power, a higher operating frequency causes a larger volume flow rate in the regenerator, hence the friction loss and the required acoustic power increase accordingly. Upon the analysis, experimental validation was carried out and the initial results demonstrate a reasonable agreement.",

        "abstract": "The expanding economical activities have accelerated losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services, which are especially pronounced in Asia. To find solutions to stop these losses, a group of scientists studying both ecological and social sciences has launched an interdisciplinary research network, entitled TSUNAGARI (Trans-System, UNified Approach for Global and Regional Integration of social-ecological study toward sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services). The project is based on two main perspectives: (1) integrating different disciplines of environmental research across multiple spatial scales, and (2) evaluating the importance of ecosystem connectivity between land and ocean for biodiversity and ecosystem services. The integrative studies have been started as follows: (1) integrating global-scale analyses of biodiversity and economy by developing GIS-based footprint analysis, (2) establishing the link between the studies of local good practices of ecosystem management and life cycle assessment on ecosystem good and services, (3) linking local-scale ecosystem studies to decision making processes for sustainable society by multiple stakeholders, and (4) upscaling local analyses of ecosystem processes to broad-scale analyses of ecosystem patterns. The proposed approaches are considered effective to solve problems that impede conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of multiple ecosystem services in various situations although we also find some gaps such as regional biases in biodiversity data and involvement of different types of stakeholders. By overcoming the major bottlenecks, we believe the new integrated approaches will promote conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystem services research, and contribute to advance decision-making processes from local communities to international levels.",

        "abstract": "The population of shorebirds in the East Asian\u2013Australasian Flyway (EAAF) has severely declined over the past several decades. One reason for this condition is low survival in stopover sites in the Yellow Sea Ecoregion (YSE) due to habitat degradation. Here, we focused on shorebird habitat quality in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), which is a representative shorebird stopover site in the YSE on the EAAF. We used the InVEST model to assess the past and future shorebird habitat quality changes by considering the effects of anthropogenic threats. The entire duration of the study was 1999\u20132016, and the modeling was done on 2000 and 2015 data. Our results indicate that the abundance of 11 shorebird species had significant downward trends (70\u201397% reduction) during 1999\u20132015. Tidal flats in the nature reserve had higher habitat quality than that in the northwestern (NW) and eastern (E) parts of the YRD because major mariculture occurred in NW and E. The mean habitat qualities in NW and E decreased by 27 and 31% during 2000\u20132015, respectively. The optimal habitat in the YRD declined from 1433\u00a0km2 in 2000 to 1154\u00a0km2 in 2015. The habitat quality decreased significantly in E and Dongying Port parts during 2015\u20132020.",

        "abstract": "Land\u2013sea ecological connectivity refers to the interaction (convenience or hindrance) of certain physical, chemical and biological processes between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Research on land\u2013sea ecological connectivity can provide important scientific bases for the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems in terrestrial and coastal areas. On the basis of a literature summary of ecological connectivity, this paper focuses on the following: (1) summarizing basic concepts, representative phenomena on multiple spatiotemporal scales, and analysis methods of land\u2013sea ecological connectivity; (2) discussion of the applications of land\u2013sea ecological connectivity; (3) discussion of the relationship between human activities and land\u2013sea ecological connectivity; (4) presentation of perspectives and recommendations on ecological restoration, protection, and biodiversity research, with emphasis on the principle of land\u2013sea ecological connectivity. On the whole, we believe such connectivity in a region varies with changes in multiple physical and artificial factors, such as climate, land cover, biotic community and human activities. Human activities such as land use, engineering construction, urbanization and industrialization have continuously increased and cause irreversible disturbance and destruction of land\u2013sea ecological connectivity, thereby threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services at various spatiotemporal scales. Hence, achievements of theoretical research and practical experience in ecological connectivity should be fully applied in coastal areas to maintain and restore land\u2013sea ecological connectivity and remedy various problems that arise from the blockage and damage of ecosystem services.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The porous ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) with confined surface carbon defects was obtained via the twice thermal treatment of bulk g-C 3 N 4 . The as-prepared porous ultrathin g-C 3 N 4  sample displayed the average thickness of about 0.9\u00a0nm. The porous ultrathin g-C 3 N 4  with confined surface carbon defects was designed to bidirectional acceleration of carrier separation for both the bulk and the surface. Multiple characterizations have been employed to determine the structure, morphology, surface feature, defect, and electronic structure of the obtained samples. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained porous ultrathin g-C 3 N 4  materials was evaluated for the degradation of rhodamine B under the visible light irradiation. The structure-activity relationship of the porous ultrathin g-C 3 N 4  materials was studied in details. The free radicals during the photocatalysis process was determined and analyzed by electron spin resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy valence band spectra technique, in which the main free radicals would be changed from superoxide radical for bulk g-C 3 N 4  to both superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical for porous ultrathin g-C 3 N 4 . This ideal material model disclosing atomic-level insights into the role of porous ultrathin structure with confined carbon defects in the enhanced photocatalytic activity.",

        "abstract": "Novel nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs)/BiOBr ultrathin nanosheets photocatalysts have been prepared via reactable ionic liquid assisted solvothermal process. The one-step formation mechanism of the N-CQDs/BiOBr ultrathin nanosheets was based on the initial formation of strong coupling between the ionic liquid and N-CQDs as well as subsequently result in tight junctions between N-CQDs and BiOBr with homodisperse of N-CQDs. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared photocatalysts was evaluated by the degradation of different pollutants under visible light irradiation such as ciprofloxacin (CIP), rhodamine B (RhB), tetracycline hydrochloride (TC), and bisphenol A (BPA). The improved photocatalytic performance of N-CQDs/BiOBr materials was ascribed to the crucial role of N-CQDs, which worked as photocenter for light harvesting, charge separation center for separating the charge carriers, and active center for degrading the pollutants.

The formation mechanism was based on the original formation of strong coupling between the IL and MWCNT, and then the tight junctions between Bi 4 O 5 Br 2  and MWCNT can be established as the bromine ions in the IL react with bismuth source to in situ produce Bi 4 O 5 Br 2  during solvothermal process. The structures, morphologies, surface features, optical properties, electronic structures and photocatalytic properties were investigated in detail. The MWCNT/Bi 4 O 5 Br 2  materials exhibited increased photocatalytic activity than pure Bi 4 O 5 Br 2  for the degradation of antibiotic agent tetracycline hydrochloride and rhodamine B. Meanwhile, the 0.1\u00a0wt% MWCNT/Bi 4 O 5 Br 2  materials displayed the highest activity. The hole and O 2   \u2212  were determined to be the main active species during the photodegradation process under visible light irradiation by the electron spin resonance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy valence band spectra and active species trapping experiments. After the introduction of MWCNT, the molecular oxygen activation capacity of Bi 4 O 5 Br 2  greatly improved, which was believed to be responsible for the increased photocatalytic activity.",

The photocatalytic performance of MoS 2 /BiOI was evaluated by using rhodamine B (RhB) as the target pollution to degrade under visible light irradiation. After the introduction of MoS 2  nanosheet, the MoS 2 /BiOI composites showed excellent photocatalytic performance. The optimal content of MoS 2  was 0.5\u00a0wt%, and the composites exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than the pure BiOI and MoS 2 /BiOI composites with different MoS 2  weight ratios. The primary cause of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of MoS 2 /BiOI was the formation of heterojunction between BiOI and MoS 2 , which could promote the electron-hole pairs separation ability. The main active species during the photocatalytic process was discussed by the radicals trapping experiments with the addition of different scavengers. Meanwhile, a possible mechanism was proposed to explicate the improvement of photocatalytic activity upon visible light irradiation.",

Experimental results revealed that Fe 3+  species were doped into the framework of g-C 3 N 4 . The effect of the amount of Fe-doping on the catalytic activity was performed. The result showed that the Fe CN could effectively degrade RhB under the condition of visible light irradiation. The photocurrent analysis showed that the incorporation of Fe 3+  into g-C 3 N 4  material could accelerate the separation of the photogenerated carriers significantly. At the same time, the reactive species generated during the photodegradation process were tested by radicals trapping experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR).

        "abstract": "Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a negative regulator of T cell activation, which competes with CD28 for B7.1/B7.2 binding with a greater affinity. Co-expression specific antigens and extracellular domain of CTLA4 represents a promising approach to increase the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. In this study, we evaluated this interesting approach for its enhancement on G250/MN/CA IX (G250)-specific immune responses and its anti-tumor effects in renal carcinoma mice model. Consequently, we constructed a DNA vaccine containing the G250 and the CTLA-4 gene. Vaccination with the co-expression DNA not only induced much higher level of anti-CTLA4 and anti-G250 antibody, but also increased G250-specific T cell response in mice. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of the plasmids, murine models with G250-expressing tumors were generated. After injection into the tumor-bearing mouse model, the plasmid carrying the co-expression gene of CTLA4 and G250 showed stronger inhibition of tumor growth than the plasmid expressing CTLA4 or G250 alone. These observations emphasize the potential of the CTLA4 and G250 co-expression DNA vaccine, which could represent a promising approach for tumor immunotherapy.",

Here, by transfection with a series of HSV-1 UL31 deletion mutants fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) was identified and mapped to amino acids (aa) 1 to 27 (MYDTDPHRRGSRPGPYHGKERRRSRSS). Additionally, fluorescence results showed that the predicted nuclear export signal (NES) might be nonfunctional, and the functional NES of UL31 might require a specific conformation. Taken together, these results would provide significant information for the study of the biological function of UL31 during HSV-1 infection. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract   BiFeO 3  (BFO) grains prepared by molten salt method were fabricated in paraffin wax based composite structure to evaluate electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and electromagnetic (EM) absorption in 2\u201318\u202fGHz. In the composites, BFO750 paraffin wax composite exhibits excellent EMI shielding and EM absorption performance. The EMI shielding effectiveness of BFO750 paraffin wax composite surpasses 10\u202fdB, and its reflection loss shows three absorption peaks which reach\u00a0\u221217\u202fdB. The absorption efficiency and attenuation constant are close to 80% and 70, respectively. The results demonstrate that absorption attenuation is the dominant mechanism of EMI shielding and EM absorption. This is attributed to multiple dielectric and magnetic relaxations, where electric and magnetic dipoles coexisting in the composite can respond intensively to electromagnetic wave in the frequency range and thus cause high electromagnetic loss. The work highlights BFO composites as promising multifunctional materials in electromagnetic wave protection fields.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Dielectric materials with high energy-storage density and efficiency have great potential applications in modern electric and electronic devices. In this work, a series of 0.9(0.94Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 TiO 3 -0.06BaTiO 3 )-0.1NaNbO 3  (BNT-BT-NN) ferroelectric thin films were deposited on LaNiO 3  ( LNO ) bottom electrodes by radio-frequency ( RF ) magnetron sputtering technique. The effects of different annealing temperature on microstructure, dielectric property and energy-storage performance of these thin films were studied in detail. Post-deposition annealing of BNT-BT-NN thin films at an appropriate temperature of 650\u202f\u00b0C was found to greatly improve the film structure and enhance the electrical characteristics, such as dense structure, smooth surface, low leakage current density, high breakdown strength ( BDS ) and large difference between maximum and remanent polarization. As a result, a huge energy-storage density of 32\u202fJ/cm 3  and a large energy-storage efficiency of 90% were achieved under 3170\u202fkV/cm in the thin film which was annealed at 650\u202f\u00b0C. Moreover, the thin film exhibited a stable energy-storage performance under different temperature and frequency. Therefore, BNT-BT-NN thin film with proper annealing temperature is a promising candidate for high energy-storage capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Double perovskite ferroelectric Bi 2 FeMo  x  Ni 1- x  O 6  (BFMNO) thin films were fabricated using the sol-gel method. The thin films have a broad-band absorption in visible light range of 400\u2013650\u202fnm. With the increase of Mo content, the optical bandgap decreases from 2.19\u202feV to 2.07\u202feV. More importantly, the as-prepared BFMNO thin films have self-polarization behavior that causes the forming of the depolarization field and build-in field in the thin films. The narrow band gap and strong ferroelectric self-polarization play a crucial part in improving the photovoltaic effect. The thin film of  x \u202f=\u202f0.7 has the optimum open circuit voltage and short circuit current which are 5.41\u202fV and 71.07\u202f\u03bcA/cm 2  under light illumination of 110\u202fmW/cm 2 . In addition, the photovoltaic effect of the thin film also exhibits a good adaptability in high temperature environment. This work highlights the applications of the BFMNO thin films as a novel high-performance ferroelectric photovoltaic material.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The immense potential of energy storage materials applied in high energy storage devices has promoted the development of various materials and the exploration of structure. Here, we present the original observations on an unusual coexistent-phase structure in relaxor ferroelectric ceramics 0.2Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 -0.8Pb(Sn  x  Ti 1- x  )O 3  (PMN-PST). The novel structure containing independent ferroelectric and relaxor phase in a single grain induces multiple electric response. More importantly, PMN-PST ceramics with the coexistent-phase structure exhibit the enhanced energy storage based on a high voltage pulse measurement. The maximum energy density reaches up to 0.85\u202fJ/cm 3  at 70\u202fkV/cm for  x \u202f=\u202f0.48, nearly three times of that of the ferroelectric ceramic ( x \u202f=\u202f0.36). It is proposed that the coexistent-phase structure generates domain switching and gives rise to coexistent-phase charge coupling that are together responsible for the excellent energy storage performance. This work opens a new pathway to develop relaxor ferroelectric materials in high energy storage fields.",

The effects of ZnO content on dielectric, energy-storage and discharge properties were systematically investigated. Dielectric constant and difference between maximum and remanent polarization were significantly improved by ZnO doping. Dielectric constant of NBT-BT-NN-1.0-wt% ZnO was 3218 at 1\u00a0kHz and room temperature, i.e. one time bigger than that of pure NBT-BT-NN ceramic. As a consequence, a maximum energy-storage density of 1.27\u00a0J/cm 3  with a corresponding efficiency of 67% was obtained in NBT-BT-NN-1.0-wt% ZnO ceramic. Moreover, its pulsed discharge energy density was 1.17\u00a0J/cm 3 , and 90% of which could be released in less than 300\u00a0ns. Therefore, ZnO doped NBT-BT-NN ceramic with a large energy-storage density and short release time could be a potential candidate for applications in high energy-storage capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Recent evidence has shown that noise-induced damage to the synapse between inner hair cells (IHCs) and type I afferent auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) may occur in the absence of permanent threshold shift (PTS), and that synapses connecting IHCs with low spontaneous rate (SR) ANFs are disproportionately affected. Due to the functional importance of low-SR ANF units for temporal processing and signal coding in noisy backgrounds, deficits in cochlear coding associated with noise-induced damage may result in significant difficulties with temporal processing and hearing in noise (i.e., \"hidden hearing loss\"). However, significant noise-induced coding deficits have not been reported at the single unit level following the loss of low-SR units. We have found evidence to suggest that some aspects of neural coding are not significantly changed with the initial loss of low-SR ANFs, and that further coding deficits arise in association with the subsequent reestablishment of the synapses. This suggests that synaptopathy in hidden hearing loss may be the result of insufficient repair of disrupted synapses, and not simply due to the loss of low-SR units. These coding deficits include decreases in driven spike rate for intensity coding as well as several aspects of temporal coding: spike latency, peak-to-sustained spike ratio and the recovery of spike rate as a function of click-interval.

        "abstract": "Recent studies on animal models have shown that noise exposure that does not lead to permanent threshold shift (PTS) can cause considerable damage around the synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and type-I afferent auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). Disruption of these synapses not only disables the innervated ANFs but also results in the slow degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons if the synapses are not reestablished. Such a loss of ANFs should result in signal coding deficits, which are exacerbated by the bias of the damage toward synapses connecting low-spontaneous-rate (SR) ANFs, which are known to be vital for signal coding in noisy background. As there is no PTS, these functional deficits cannot be detected using routine audiological evaluations and may be unknown to subjects who have them. Such functional deficits in hearing without changes in sensitivity are generally called \u201cnoise-induced hidden hearing loss (NIHHL).\u201d Here, we provide a brief review to address several critical issues related to NIHHL: (1) the mechanism of noise induced synaptic damage, (2) reversibility of the synaptic damage, (3) the functional deficits as the nature of NIHHL in animal studies, (4) evidence of NIHHL in human subjects, and (5) peripheral and central contribution of NIHHL.",

        "abstract": "Noise pollution is a major hazardous factor to human health and is likely harmful for vulnerable groups such as pre-term infants under life-support system in an intensive care unit. Previous studies have suggested that noise exposure impairs children's learning ability and cognitive performance and cognitive functions in animal models in which the effect is mainly attributed to the oxidant stress of noise on the cognitive brain. The potential role of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL), rather than the oxidant stress, has also been indicated by a depression of neurogenesis in the hippocampus long after a brief noise exposure, which produces only a tentative oxidant stress. It is not clear if noise exposure and NIHL during early development exerts a long term impact on cognitive function and neurogenesis towards adulthood. In the present study, a brief noise exposure at high sound level was performed in neonatal C57BL/6J mice (15 days after birth) to produce a significant amount of permanent hearing loss as proved 2 months after the noise. At this age, the noise-exposed animals showed deteriorated spatial learning and memory abilities and a reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis as compared with the control. The averaged hearing threshold was found to be strongly correlated with the scores for spatial learning and memory. We consider the effects observed are largely due to the loss of hearing sensitivity, rather than the oxidant stress, due to the long interval between noise exposure and the observations.",

In this paper, we propose a new security model for key exchange protocols which can not only consider what keys can be compromised as well as when they are compromised. The proposed security model is important to the security proof of the key exchange protocols with forward secrecy (either weak forward secrecy (wFS) or strong forward secrecy (sFS)). In addition, a new kind of key compromise impersonation (KCI) attacks which is called strong key compromise impersonation (sKCI) attack is proposed. Finally, we provide a new one-round key exchange protocol called mOT+ based on mOT protocol. The security of the mOT+ is given in the new model. It can provide the properties of sKCI-resilience and sFS and it is secure even if the ephemeral key reveal query is considered.",

        "abstract": "The long-lasting loss of sleep is a generally acknowledged risk factor for the occurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD), whereas sleep abnormalities being a key clinic symptom of the MDD. In our previous work, we demonstrated that the sleep deprivation (SD) stimulates activation of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes as well as the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 from astrocytes. However, the underlying mechanism connecting SD and MDD still requires further study. Apart of the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, SD affects production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) while release of BDNF from astrocytes appears a key contributor to mood disorders. If and how the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome following SD affects the level of BDNF remains unknown. Antidepressant fluoxetine acts through astroglial 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B (5-HT); these receptors are also related to the sleep-wake cycle. Contribution of leptin to MDD has been discovered recently, although the mechanistic links between leptin and the depressive-like behaviors has not been revealed. In this study, we discovered: (i) that activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was involved in the depressive-like behaviors induced by SD; (ii) decrease in BDNF following SD required the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes; (iii) leptin augmented the anti-depressive action of fluoxetine through an increase in expression of astrocytic 5-HT receptors. We suggest that decrease in BDNF by the activated NLRP3 inflammasomes in astrocytes is the key pathological event of the depressive-like behaviors induced by SD, while the combined treatment with fluoxetine and leptin improves therapeutic outcome for the depression induced by SD.",

        "title": "The Ameliorative Effect of Fluoxetine on Neuroinflammation Induced by Sleep Deprivation.",
        "abstract": "It is well known that sleep disorders are harmful to people's health and performance, and growing evidence suggests that sleep deprivation (SD) can trigger neuroinflammation in the brain. The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is reported to be relevant to the neuroinflammation induced by SD, but the regulatory signaling that governs the NLRP3 inflammasome in SD is still unknown. Meanwhile, whether the regulatory action of antidepressants in astrocytes could affect the neuroinflammation induced by SD also remains obscure. In this study, we were the first to discover that the antidepressant fluoxetine, a type of specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) widely used in clinical practice, could suppress the neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis induced by SD. The main findings from this study are as follows: 1) SD stimulated the expression of activated NLRP3 inflammasomes and the maturation of IL-1\u03b2/18 via suppressing the phosphorylation of STAT3 in astrocytes; 2) SD decreased the activation of AKT and stimulated the phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2, which inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3; 3) the NLRP3 inflammasome expression stimulated by SD was partly mediated by the P2X7 receptor; 4) an agonist of STAT3 could significantly abolish the expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes induced by an agonist of the P2X7 receptor in primary cultured astrocytes; 5) the administration of fluoxetine could reverse the stimulation of NLRP3 inflammasome expression and function by SD through elevating the activation of STAT3. In conclusion, our present research suggests the promising possibility that fluoxetine could ameliorate the neuronal impairment induced by SD. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a type of long-term disability with a high morbidity rate in clinical settings for which there is no effective clinical treatment to date. Usually, lithium is used as a popular mood stabilizer. Recently, growing evidence has shown that lithium has clear neuroprotective effects after SCI, and the administration of lithium can effectively improve locomotor recovery. However, the exact neuroprotective mechanism of lithium is still not understood. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3\u03b2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an important role in the neuroprotective effects of lithium both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we discovered that lithium inhibits GSK3\u03b2 activity through two different signaling pathways in spinal cord neurons. In the acute phase, lithium inhibited GSK3\u03b2 activity by stimulating phosphorylation of AKT; in the chronic phase, we first discovered that lithium additionally upregulated the expression of Na, K-ATPase \u03b11 (NKA \u03b11), which had an inhibitory effect on GSK3\u03b2 activity by inducing the expression of glucocorticoid inducible kinase 1 (SGK1). SGK1 is well known as a regulator of the GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, the suppressed activity of GSK3\u03b2 increased the level of \u03b2-catenin in the cytoplasm, which gave rise to the translocation of the freely stabilized \u03b2-catenin to the nucleus. In addition, the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus had the benefits of neuronal survival. Hopefully our findings from this study are beneficial in revealing the neuroprotective mechanism of lithium and in offering novel targets for the development of new SCI therapeutic drugs.",

        "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes long-term disability and has no effective clinical treatment. After SCI, extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) leads to an influx of extracellular Ca, and this Ca overload causes neuronal toxicosis and apoptosis. The biological functions of leptin have been widely investigated in the central nervous system. In this study, we discovered that the administration of leptin could improve locomotor recovery following SCI. The aim of this study was to determine the neuroprotective mechanism of leptin in vivo and in vitro. The neuronal apoptosis and Ca imaging signal induced by ATP were suppressed by leptin, due to elevated caveolin-1 expression. In vivo two-photon observations revealed that leptin reduced the neuronal Ca imaging signal in the exposed spinal cords of live Thy1-YFP mice. In conclusion, leptin promotes locomotor functional recovery and suppresses neuronal impairment after SCI, suggesting that leptin has a promising clinical therapeutic value for treatment of SCI.",

A controlled size of ultrasmall PbS QDs modified with distinct ligands of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) or oleic acid was used to construct plasmon-active electrodes for three-electrode electrochemical measurements. The enhanced photoelectrochemical response of PbS QDs excited by localized surface plasmon resonance was observed at a relatively wide wavelength region. MPA capped the smaller PbS QD results in the enhancements of photocurrent at shorter wavelength light illumination below 500 nm where the plasmonic enhancement generally competes with multiexciton generation. The size-dependent resonance of PbS QDs with Au nanoparticles was discussed considering the energy of localized surface plasmon of the coupled system.",

Enhanced electromagnetic field caused by the coupling of QDs with plasmonic Au nanodimers allowed the characteristic behavior of the ligand oleic acid (OA) on the PbS QD surface to be detected under electrochemical potential control. Binding modes between the QDs and OA molecules were characterized using synchronous two-dimensional correlation spectra at distinct electrochemical potentials, confirming that the bidentate bridging mode was probably the most stable mode even under relatively negative potential polarization. Changes in binding modes and molecular orientations resulted in fluctuations in EC-SERS spectra.

        "abstract": "Electromotive force of photovoltaics is a key to define the output power density of photovoltaics. Multiple exciton generation (MEG) exhibited by semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has great potential to enhance photovoltaic performance owing to the ability to generate more than one electron-hole pairs when absorbing a single photon. However, even in MEG-based photovoltaics, limitation of modifying the electromotive force exists due to the intrinsic electrochemical potential of the conduction band-edges of QDs. Here we report a pronouncedly improved photovoltaic performance by constructing a PbS QD-sensitized electrode that comprises plasmon-active Au nanoparticles embedded in a titanium dioxide thin film. Significant enhancement on electromotive force is characterized by the onset potential of photocurrent generation using MEG-effective PbS QDs with a narrow bandgap energy (Eg = 0.9 eV). By coupling with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), such QDs exhibit improved photoresponses and the highest output power density over the other QDs with larger bandgap energies (Eg = 1.1 and 1.7 eV) under visible light irradiation. The wavelength-dependent onset potential and the output power density suggest effective electron injection owing to the enhanced density of electrons excited by energy overlapping between MEG and LSPR.",

For Yb-Er codoped BLP, the UC emission spectra exhibit a gradual enhancement with increasing pump power, and two-photon process for the green and red emissions of Er has been confirmed by studying the dependence of UC emission intensities on excitation power. When the temperature rises, the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) for the H2-I and S4-I emissions of Er increases gradually due to the thermalization of populations at the H2 and S4 levels. With the temperature increased, the absolute sensitivity (S) shows a continuous increase and reaches about 4.38\u00d710\u2009\u2009K at 498\u00a0K, but the relative sensitivity (S) decreases gradually. For Yb-Tm codoped BLP, the emission intensity of Tm shows a gradual decrease with increasing Tm concentration. By studying the temperature dependence of FIR for the (F3,F3)-H3 and H3-H emissions, it has been found the sample exhibits a higher S value but a lower S value relative to the Yb-Er codoped BLP.",

The phase composition of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction, indicating the pre-prepared phosphors are all single-phase. For the Ba 9 Y 1.52 Si 6 O 24 :0.4Yb 3+ ,0.08Er 3+  sample, it has been found that the intensity ratio of the  2 H 11/2 - 4 I 15/2  to  4 S 3/2 - 4 I 15/2  emissions of Er 3+  shows a continuous increase with increasing temperature upon 980\u00a0nm excitation owing to the well-known thermally coupled levels of Er 3+ . It was also found that decay lifetime on  4 S 3/2  level of Er 3+  changes with temperature. For the Ba 9 Y 1.52 Si 6 O 24 :0.4Yb 3+ ,0.08Ho 3+  phosphor, the green ( 5 F 4 , 5 S 2 )- 5 I 8  emission of Ho 3+  exhibits a faster decay rate in intensity relative to the red  5 F 5 - 5 I 8  one when the measure temperature increases. The corresponding reason has been discussed by the energy level diagram and decay lifetime. For the Ba 9 Y 1.58 Si 6 O 24 :0.4Yb 3+ ,0.02Tm 3+  sample, it was found that the change of the emission intensity ratio of the Tm 3+ 3 H 4 - 3 H 6  to ( 3 F 2 , 3 F 3 )- 3 H 6  transitions with the temperature follows the Boltzmann distribution. The sensitivities of the above phosphors were calculated, and the high sensitivity values indicate the present phosphors could be a promising candidate for optical temperature sensors.",

We show that the probe transmission can exceed unity at low control power due to the optical gain of the cavity and it can be further enhanced or suppressed by tuning the amplitude and phase of the phonon pump. Furthermore, the phase dispersion of the transmitted probe field is modified by controlling the applied fields, which allows one to tune the group delay of the probe field. Based on this optomechianical system, we can realize a tunable switch between slow and fast light effect by adjusting the gain-to-loss ratio, power of the control field as well as the amplitude and phase of the phonon pump. Our work provides a platform to control the light propagation in a more flexible way.",

For Tb-single-doped KYP, the green emission mainly owing to the 5D4\u20137FJ (J\u2009=\u20093\u20136) transitions was obtained. For Eu-single-doped KYP, two kinds of emissions were observed, i.e., the line-peak and broad-band emissions, belonging to the Eu3+ 5D0\u20137FJ (J\u2009=\u20090\u20134) and Eu2+ d\u2013f transitions, respectively.

The resultant lysine-derived carbon hollow cubes with hierarchical pores on the wall are conducive to mass transport and high utilization of nitrogen dopant-induced active sites during the electrocatalytic process. When used as electrocatalysts for the ORR, an onset potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE has been achieved for NCHCs. A negative shift of only 61 mV exists in the half-wave potential of NCHCs compared to that of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). Moreover, the NCHCs show high activity for the OER comparable to that of commercial RuO/C (20 wt%). The sustainable conversion of biomass lysine to heteroatom-doped carbon hollow cubes and the recyclability of the NaCl template allow a scalable production and practical application of carbon materials for energy storage and conversion.",

Despite several decades pursuing, bifunctional oxygen catalysts with high catalytic performance at low-cost, especially the one that could be easily scaled up for mass production are still missing and highly desired. Herein, a hybrid catalyst with NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorated on N-doped carbon nanofibers is synthesized by a facile electrospinning method and postcalcination treatment. The hybrid catalyst NiCo@N-C 2 exhibits outstanding ORR and OER catalytic performances, which is even surprisingly superior to the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts, respectively. The synergetic effects between alloy nanoparticles and the N-doped carbon fiber are considered as the main contributions for the excellent catalytic activities, which include decreasing the intrinsic and charge transfer resistances, increasing CC, graphitic-N/pyridinic-N contents in the hybrid catalyst. This work opens up a new way to fabricate high-efficient, low-cost oxygen catalysts with high production.",

Herein, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  pseudo-nanocubes have been synthesized with a facile solvothermal method, and then \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 @N C composite catalysts were prepared through chemical polymerization of pyrrole on \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , following with pyrolyzed in nitrogen atmosphere. The synthesized composite catalysts display enhanced ORR catalytic performances, including the positive shifting of the onset potential, improving of the limited current density with long-term stability compared to those of the pristine \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . The enhanced electrocatalytic performances could be ascribed to the low intrinsic and charge transfer resistances, the high content of pyridinic-N and/or Fe N, the emergence of graphitic-N and abundant oxygen vacancy on the composite surface. This study here implies that the catalytic activity and stability of metal oxides with poor conductivity could be controlled and improved by simply coating with a nanoscale conductive layer, which shows promising potential applications as precious-metal free catalysts for various metal-air batteries and fuel cells.",

In this paper, we present a fast background removal method for 3D multi-channel deep tissue fluorescence images, in which the objectives of different channels are well separated. We first conduct a window-based normalization to distinguish foreground signals from background noises in all channels. Then, we identify the pure background regions by conducting subtraction of images in different channels, which allow us to estimate the background noises of the whole images by interpolation. Experiments on real 3D datasets of mouse stomach show our method has superior performance and efficiency comparing with the current state-of-the-art background correction methods.",

        "abstract": "It is widely recognized that the higher-order spatial organization of the genome, beyond the nucleosome, plays an important role in many biological processes. However, to date, direct information of even such fundamental structural details as the typical sizes and DNA content of these higher-order structures in situ is poorly characterized. Here, we examine the nanoscopic DNA organization within human nuclei using super-resolution direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) imaging and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) click chemistry, studying single fully-labeled chromosomes within an otherwise unlabeled nuclei to improve the attainable resolution. We find that, regardless of nuclear position, individual sub-chromosomal regions consist of three different levels of DNA compaction: (i) dispersed chromatin; (ii) nanodomains of sizes ranging tens of nanometers containing a few kilobases (kb) of DNA; and (iii) clusters of nanodomains. Interestingly, the sizes and DNA content of the nanodomains are approximately the same at the nuclear periphery, nucleolar proximity, and nuclear interior, suggesting that these nanodomains share a roughly common higher-order architecture. Overall, these results suggest that DNA compaction within the eukaryote nucleus occurs via the condensation of DNA into few-kb nanodomains of approximately similar structure, with further compaction occurring via the clustering of nanodomains.",

Aims of the study  To investigate the effect and optimal protocol for hyperbaric-oxygen therapy (HBOT), and reduce incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in ICH.    Methods  This prospective, randomized, controlled trial included 565 patients with acute severe ICH. Participants were randomly assigned to a sham-control group (Group A) and four intervention groups: Groups B and C with 2.0\u00a0atmospheres absolute (ATA) pressure and HBOT exposure for 60 or 90 sessions, respectively; and Groups D and E with 1.5 ATA for 60 or 90 sessions, respectively. All patients received emergency craniotomy with hematoma evacuation. Outcome measures were modified Barthel Index (MBI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, mortality rates at follow-up six months. UGIB rates were assessed as potential side effect.    Results  In four intervention groups, MBI and mRS scores were all significantly improved, and mortality rates were all significantly decreased compared with Group A (all  p  p     Conclusions  HBOT significantly improves survival and functional outcomes of ICH. HBOT at 1.5 and 2.0 ATA had the same beneficial effect. A pressure of 1.5 ATA and 60 HBOT exposures represents an optimal protocol for HBOT. Further studies are needed to optimize the protocol per specific patient.",

The aim of the study was to explore the correlation of let-7b expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis in human glioma.Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to detect the relative expression of let-7b in glioma tissues. The association of let-7b expression with clinicopatholoigcal features of glioma patients was estimated using chi-square test. Overall survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test. The prognosis analysis was performed using Cox regression model, and the results were shown as hazard ration (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).The relative expression of let-7b was significantly lower in glioma tissues than that in normal brain tissues (P\u200a<\u200a.001). Furthermore, let-7b level was closely correlated with World Health Organization (WHO) grade (P\u200a=\u200a.027) and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (P\u200a=\u200a.018). Survival analysis indicated that glioma patients with low let-7b expression had significantly shorter overall survival time than those with high expression (log rank test, P\u200a<\u200a.001). Let-7b might be an independent prognostic biomarker for glioma (P\u200a<\u200a.001, HR\u200a=\u200a2.415; 95% CI: 1.531-3.808).Let-7b may be a promising prognostic factor in glioma.",

In order to explore the dynamic process of bubble-eddy interaction, a theoretical model considering the surface deformation, is proposed through dimensional analysis in this work. Our model indicates that the bubble deformability depends on two key factors: the size ratio between the turbulent structure and the mother bubble, and the Weber number. Binary breakup of one single bubble is described through the degree of the surface deformation, and the effect of breakage constraints on it is investigated. It is found that equal-size breakage is dominated by the energy constraint, while most unequal-size breakage is dominated by the force constraint. The characteristic sizes of effective colliding eddies contributing to the bubble breakup process are computed based on the change of the surface energy. This work not only overcomes the sensitivity of the breakup models for turbulent dispersion systems to these parameters, but also gives good predication of bubble deformability in two-phase turbulent flow.",

Theoretically, this model shows that the thrust coefficient/specific impulse of PDRE is a function of the nozzle contraction/expansion ratio and the operating frequency. The relationship between the nozzle contraction ratio and the operation frequency is obtained by introducing the duty ratio, by which the key problem in the theoretical design can be solved. Therefore, the performance of PDRE can be accessed to guide the preliminary shape design of nozzle conveniently and quickly. The higher the operating frequency of PDRE is, the smaller the nozzle contraction ratio should be. Besides, the lower the ambient pressure is, the larger the expansion ratio of the nozzle should be. When the ambient pressure is 1.013 \u00d7 105 Pa, the optimal expansion ratio will be less than 2.26. When the ambient pressure is reduced to vacuum, the extremum of the optimal thrust coefficient is 2.236 9, and the extremum of the specific impulse is 321.01 s. The results of the improved model are verified by numerical simulation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, we report a dramatic enhancement in ethanol sensing characteristics of Co\u2013Sn oxides composites with 3D hierarchical architectures, which have been successfully synthesized via an environment friendly one-step hydrothermal approach. The response (resistance ratio) of cobalt oxide and tin oxide composites to 100\u00a0ppm ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) was 201 at 200\u00a0\u00b0C, representing a significant improvement in comparison to tin oxide 3D hierarchical architectures (7.5, correspondingly). The high response of detection of ethanol can be attributed to the change of charge carrier concentration and the variation of oxygen adsorption due to the formation of abundant heterojunction barriers as well as the tuned catalytic activity of Co components, which induce dissociation of ethanol molecule. The unique nanostructure also played an important role in detecting ethanol gas, due to its contribution in facilitating the transport rate and augmenting the adsorption quantity of the target gas molecules.",

As the gas sensing materials of MOS gas sensors, their sensing properties were investigated systematically. The results indicated that the 2.15 at% Al-doped NiO nanorod-flowers showed improved gas sensing properties compared to those of pure NiO nanorod-flowers. The incorporation of Al ions with NiO nanocrystals adjusts the carrier concentration, and induces the change of the oxygen deficiency and chemisorbed oxygen of NiO nanorod-flowers.

The images of electron microscopy unambiguously indicated that the ZnFe2O4 nanosheets with thickness of around 20 nm assembled hierarchically to form the unique flower-like architecture. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of the function, the as-prepared product was utilized as sensing material for gas sensor.

        "abstract": "Palladium (Pd) nanoparticle (NP)-decorated carbon nanotube (CNT) ropes (or CNT@PdNP) are used as the sensing element for hydrogen gas (H) chemiresistors. In spite of the fact that Pd NPs have a mean diameter below 6 nm and are highly dispersed on the CNT surfaces, CNT@PdNP ropes produce a relative resistance change 20-30 times larger than is observed at single, pure Pd nanowires. Thus, CNT@PdNP rope sensors improve upon all H sensing metrics (speed, dynamic range, and limit-of-detection), relative to single Pd nanowires which heretofore have defined the state-of-the-art in H sensing performance. Specifically, response and recovery times in air at [H] \u2248 50 ppm are one-sixth of those produced by single Pd nanowires with cross-sectional dimensions of 40 \u00d7 100 nm Pd. The LOD is <10 ppm versus 300 ppm, and the dynamic range (10 ppm -4%) is nearly twice that afforded by the Pd nanowire. CNT@PdNP rope sensors are prepared by the dielectrophoretic deposition of a single semiconducting CNT rope followed by the electrodeposition of Pd nanoparticles with mean diameters ranging from 4.5 (\u00b11) nm to 5.8 (\u00b13) nm. The diminutive mean diameter and the high degree of diameter monodispersity for the deposited Pd nanoparticles are distinguishing features of the CNT@PdNP rope sensors described here, relative to prior work on similar systems.",

        "abstract": "To functionalize the advanced controlled drug delivery systems, gold nanomaterials have been explored as photothermal therapy agents owing to their tunable and strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). As the major tissue chromophores are barely absorptive in the near-infrared (NIR) region (650\u2013900 nm), it is becoming particularly important to regulate the LSPR absorption of gold nanomaterials to the NIR region to minimize the absorption. The main factors for the LSPR absorption of nanomaterials, which decides the photothermal effects, drug release, and antitumor efficacy of gold-based drug carriers, include morphology, size, and dielectric constant of surrounding mediums. Herein, gold nanoparticles-coated paclitaxel nanoliposomes (PTX-Lips@AuNPs) with various morphologies, sizes, and dielectric constant of surrounding mediums were synthesized. We studied the regulatory mechanism of LSPR absorption and their antitumor efficacy. The results showed that the branched gold nanoshells-coated paclitaxe...",

The nanoparticles with polypeptides serving as a core and coated Ag/Au bimetallic nanoshells exhibit diverse advantages, such as excellent biocompatibility, tumor targeting and low-cost. The Vap@Ag/AuNSs share excellent dispersibility, uniform size (120 nm) and a positive zeta potential (36.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.49 mV), hence they easily accumulate in negatively charged tumor tissue. The results of thermal imaging, temperature variation assays and photothermal conversion efficiency (41.6%) indicated that Vap@Ag/AuNSs have excellent photothermal conversion capability. Based on their photothermal response, as well as biocompatibility determined by MTT assay, the prominent anti-tumor effects of Vap@Ag/AuNSs have been verified by fluorescein diacetate staining. Therefore, Vap@Ag/AuNSs are novel and promising candidates for photothermal tumor therapy.",

        "abstract": "Inaccessibility of deep-seated malignant cells in the central region of tumors and uncontrollable tumor recurrence represent a significant challenge for conventional synergistic cancer therapy. Herein, we designed a novel nanoplatform based on hierarchical drug release for deep cascade cancer therapy including localized photothermal therapy, systematic chemotherapy, and elicited immune responses.  The first-step chemotherapy could be carried out by polydopamine (PDA) releasing doxorubicin (DOX) in the specific microenvironment of lysosomes (pH 5.5). The branched gold nanoshells and PDA converted the light to heat efficiently to accomplish the second-step photothermal therapy and collapsed biomimetic vesicles (BVs) to release paclitaxel (PTX), which promoted the third-step of chemotherapy and triggered immune responses.  After 10 days of treatment, there were no obvious residual tumors in tumor-bearing mice. Significantly, 10 days after stopping treatment, mice in the drug immune-therapeutic group showed little tumor recurrence (1.5 times) compared to substantial recurrence (20 times) in the conventional treatment group.  The hierarchical drug release and cascade therapeutic modality enhance the penetration of drugs deep into the tumor tissue and effectively inhibit recurrence. This cascade therapeutic modality provides a novel approach for more effective cancer therapy.",

In addition, we can switch OB to OM by adjusting the intensity of control field and the density of GeV centers or vice versa.

Existing equations obtained by regression analysis of experimental data use correction factors to account for variable property effect. They are limited to specific kind of fluid and low or medium temperature differences. The correction factors of the equations for heating and cooling conditions are different. New explicit friction factor and Nusselt number equations for laminar forced convection of liquid with variable properties are derived with a first order approximation of dynamic viscosity-temperature variation. The new equations are applicable to all kinds of liquids and can be used for large temperature differences. Governing equations of laminar forced convection of water and ethanol are numerically solved using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and the results are used to verify the derived equations. The derived equations show good predictions of friction factors and Nusselt numbers for both heating and cooling conditions and show more accurate predictions than the existing equations. A dimensionless number is also introduced based on theoretical analysis to evaluate property variation effects on friction factors and heat transfer coefficients.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Large temperature differences between the wall and bulk fluid in heat exchangers will result in significant property variations in the cross section. Most existing equations use correction factors such as       (    \u03bc    w    /    \u03bc    b    )    n       or       (    Pr    w    /    Pr    b    )    m       to take account of property variation effects on heat transfer coefficients and friction factors. The exponents,  n  or  m  obtained by regression analysis of experimental data are not consistent in the literature. They are also different for heating and cooling conditions. In the current investigation, velocity and temperature distributions of turbulent convection with variable properties in circular tubes are analyzed using classical turbulent boundary layer theory. The viscosity variation effects on velocity and temperature fields are simplified to the effects on the critical point between the linear and the logarithmic distribution regions. New friction factor and Nusselt number equations for turbulent convection of liquids with variable properties are obtained. The new equations show accurate predictions of experimental data for both heating and cooling conditions and for different kinds of liquids. The new equations show that viscosity variation effects on friction factor decrease with the increasing of Reynolds number, while its effects on Nusselt number almost keep constant with the increasing of Reynolds number.",

Compared with constant property water flow, centrifugal forces near the wall are decreased due to lower densities while centrifugal forces in the center are increased due to higher densities, which result in stronger secondary flow intensity for supercritical water flow. Due to large buoyancy forces, the secondary flow is stretched. The maximum secondary flow velocity near the bottom wall region is 17.6% higher than that near the top wall region. For heating conditions, the axial velocities are accelerated in the flow direction and result in increased secondary flow intensities. However, when the bulk temperature reaching the pseudo-critical temperature, the temperature distributions are flattened and the non-uniformities of wall temperature distributions are decreased due to the higher effective thermal conductivities.",

        "abstract": "The heat and mass transfer processes of natural convective condensation with noncondensable gases are very important for the passive containment cooling system of water cooled reactors. Numerical simulation of natural convective condensation with noncondensable gases was realized in the Fluent software by adding condensation models. The scaled AP600 containment condensation experiment was simulated to verify the numerical method. It was shown that the developed method can predict natural convective condensation with noncondensable gases well. The velocity, species, and density fields in the scaled AP600 containment were presented. The heat transfer rate distribution and the influences of the mass fraction of air on heat transfer rate were also analyzed. It is found that the driving force of natural convective condensation with noncondensable gases is mainly caused by the mass fraction difference but not temperature difference. The natural convective condensation with noncondensable gases in AP1000 containment was then simulated. The temperature, species, velocity, and heat flux distributions were obtained and analyzed. The upper head of the containment contributes to 35.1% of the total heat transfer rate, while its area only takes 25.4% of the total condensation area of the containment. The influences of the mass fraction of low molecular weight noncondensable gas (hydrogen) on the natural convective condensation were also discussed based on the detailed species, density, and velocity fields. The results show that addition of hydrogen (production of zirconium-water reaction after severe accident) will weaken the intensity of natural convection and the heat and mass transfer processes significantly. When hydrogen contributes to 50% mole fraction of the noncondensable gases, the heat transfer coefficient will be reduced to 45%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Generated by abrasion of fuel spheres, graphite dust is an important issue for the operation and maintenance of high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR), because the transport of fission product is coupled closely with graphite dusts. AVR experiments on dust specific radioactivity indicated that graphite dust deposition on steam generator (SG) should be of special interest. Combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and discrete phase method, the deposition of graphite dust on the upper 5 layers of SG tubes is studied in this work. The results are then used to analyze the influence of various factors, including particle\u2013wall interaction, vortex structure effect and deposition mechanisms. By incorporating the critical capture velocity into CFD simulation, the probability of particle rebound is quantitatively considered. The result shows that the deposition rate is highly overestimated if the simple assumption of hit-and-stick is adopted. The comparison between RANS and LES results indicate that the RANS simulation augments the deposition rate by more than one order. Due to the loss of vortex information in RANS, the number of particles in the near-wall regime is unphysically overestimated and thus leads to much larger deposition rate. Finally, the contributions of different deposition mechanisms are investigated by switching on/off certain terms in the simulation. It is shown that thermophoresis is more dominant for small particle up to 3\u20134\u202f\u00b5m and Brownian diffusion is negligible for sub-micron particles.",

        "abstract": "The Late Permian to Late Triassic Great Bank of Guizhou (GBG) in southwest China is one of the few isolated carbonate platforms in the world that exposes an essentially complete record of initiation, development, and drowning across multiple platform-to-basin transects. The platform is exceptionally exposed in cross section at the surface by a faulted syncline that rotated strata to a dip angle of approximately 65\u00b0. Platform development spanned the end-Permian extinction and Triassic recovery that marks the transition from Paleozoic to Mesozoic styles of carbonate sediment production, providing a rare opportunity to assess the impact of global changes in carbonate factory types at a single locality. In addition, regional basin controls such as differential siliciclastic sediment input and varied antecedent topography provided mechanisms for lateral variability in platform morphology that can be investigated along exposures in several geographic sectors. Consequently, the GBG preserves a record of temporal and spatial variability in platform architecture that offers an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the controls on isolated carbonate platform morphology. A better understanding of these mechanisms is critical for improving predictive geologic models in exploration and field-development settings. The GBG also serves as a key outcrop analog for Early Triassic oolite reservoirs in the Middle East and China, the steep microbial-boundstone slopes of Carboniferous platforms in Kazakhstan, and the Permian platforms of Texas and New Mexico.",

        "abstract": "We appreciate Kershaw et al.u0027s comment and continued interest in our Permian\u2013Triassic research in the Nanpanjiang Basin. Kershaw et al. comment on aspects of our recent study that contradict results from the study of Collin et al. (2009). Specifically their comments center around two questions: (1) whether the truncation surface at the base of the Permian\u2013Triassic microbialite shows evidence for subaerial exposure, and (2) whether data support the model of genesis of the microbialites by upwelling of anoxic, alkaline waters with elevated carbonate saturation from bacterial sulfate reduction (Kershaw et al. 1999, 2007, 2012).We note that our recent study is much broader in scope than the issues addressed in this comment and reply. Our study presented extensive stratigraphic, geochemical, biostratigraphic and petrographic analyses from multiple sections, introduced new sections that have not been presented in the literature, and evaluated multiple models for the genesis of the microbialite and underlying truncation surface. We welcome this opportunity to respond to Kershaw et al.u0027s comment and to further illuminate studies of the Permian\u2013Triassic boundary in the Nanpanjiang Basin.### Two Generations of Fibrous Cement Fringe? Maybe, But There is Still no Evidence for Pendant GeometryKershaw et al. comment that there are two generations of bladed fringing cement adhered to grains and that only the second generation has a pendant geometry. Collin et al. (2009) made the same interpretation.From the photographs in Collin et al. (2009, fig. 5Aa\u20135Ab) and from our thin section observations, we interpreted this to be a single generation of fibrous cement fringe adhered to grains, with a faint zonation of clear-cloudy-clear alternation within the fringe, in which the cloudy zone contained a greater concentration of fluid inclusions (fig. 1A, 1B). Note that the photos presented in the comment by Kershaw et al. (figs. 3, 4) are also consistent with this interpretation. The entire bladed cement fringe was used \u2026",

This study aims to explore the potential of selected candidate biomarkers (SNCA, SPG20 and FBN1) in stool samples for identifying patients with adenomas or  Methods:  Thirty-one patients with CRC, 49 patients with adenomas, and 64 normal controls were selected. Stool samples were processed by the stool intestinal mucosal cells collector and analyzed by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP). Results:  Promoter methylation status of genes was denoted as percentage of methylated reference (PMR) values. The SNCA PMR values were significantly higher in CRC and adenomas groups than normal controls. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for SNCA was 0.836 and 0.772 for detection of CRC and adenomas, respectively. The sensitivity of stool-based SNCA methylation was 83.9% for CRC and 75.5% for adenomas, with the specificity of 75% for both. The odds ratio (OR) for CRC and adenomas with stool SNCA hypermethylation was 11.291 and 9.234, respectively, after adjustment for patients\u2019 age and sex. Though there was a trend of increase of SNCA promoter methylation with disease progression, the difference was not significant. No significant difference in stool-based SNCA methylation was found between proximal and distal lesions. SNCA methylation significantly reduced after tumor resection compared to the initial status. The SPG20 and FBN1 methylation status was not significantly different among groups.  Conclusions:  The results validated the capability of SNCA methylation in stool samples for the identification of patients with adenomas or CRC.",

        "title": "Sequencing of the MHC region defines HLA-DQA1 as the major independent risk for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)-positive rheumatoid arthritis in Han population",
        "abstract": "The strong genetic contribution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility has been generally attributed to HLA-DRB1. However, due to the high linkage disequilibrium in the MHC region, it is difficult to define the real or additional independent genetic risks using the conventional HLA genotyping or chip-based microarray technology. By the capture sequencing of entire MHC region for discovery and HLA-typing for validation in 2,773 subjects of Han ancestry, we identified HLA-DQ\u03b11:160D as the strongest independent genetic risk for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)-positive RA in Han population ( P  = 6.16 x 10 -36 , OR=2.29). Further stepwise conditional analysis revealed that DR\u03b21:37N has an independent protective effect on ACPA-positive RA ( P =5.81 x 10 -16 , OR=0.49). The DQ\u03b11:160 coding allele  DQA1*0303  displayed high impact on joint radiographic severity, especially in patients with early disease and smoking (P = 3.02 x 10 -5 ). Interaction analysis by comparative molecular modeling revealed that the negative charge of DQ\u03b11:160D stabilizes the dimer of dimers, leading to an increased T cell activation. The electrostatic potential surface analysis indicated that the negative charged DR\u03b21:37N encoding alleles could bind with epitope P9 arginine, thus may result in a decreased RA susceptibility. In this study, we provide the first evidence that  HLA-DQA1 , instead of  HLA-DRB1 , is the strongest and independent genetic risk for ACPA-positive RA in Chinese Han population. Our study also illustrates the value of MHC deep sequencing for fine mapping disease risk variants in the MHC region.",

        "title": "Sequencing of the MHC region defines HLA-DQA1 as the major genetic risk for seropositive rheumatoid arthritis in Han Chinese population",
        "abstract": "Objective: The strong genetic contribution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been generally attributed to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1. However, due to the high polymorphisms and linkage disequilibrium within MHC, it is difficult to define novel and/or independent genetic risks using conventional HLA genotyping or chip-based microarray technology. This study aimed to identify novel RA risk variants by performing deep sequencing for MHC. Methods: We first conducted target sequencing for the entire MHC region in 357 anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)-positive patients with RA and 1001 healthy controls, and then performed HLA typing in an independent case-control cohort consisting of 1415 samples for validation. All study subjects were Han Chinese. Genetic associations for RA susceptibility and severity were analysed. Comparative modelling was constructed to predict potential functions for the newly discovered RA association variants. Results: HLA-DQ\u03b11:160D conferred the strongest and independent susceptibility to ACPA-positive RA (p=6.16\u00d710 36 , OR=2.29). DR\u03b21:37N had an independent protective effect (p=5.81\u00d710 16 , OR=0.49). As predicted by comparative modelling, the negatively charged DQ\u03b11:160D stabilises the dimer of dimers, thus may lead to an increased T cell activation. The negatively charged DR\u03b21:37N encoding alleles preferentially bind with epitope P9 arginine, thus may result in a decreased RA susceptibility. Conclusions: We provide the first evidence that HLA-DQ\u03b11:160D, instead of HLA-DRB1\u22170405, is the strongest and independent genetic risk for ACPA-positive RA in Han Chinese. Our study also illustrates the value of deep sequencing for fine-mapping disease risk variants in the MHC region. \u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

        "abstract": "Bismuth-based solar cells have exhibited some advantages over lead perovskite solar cells for nontoxicity and superior stability, which are currently two main concerns in the photovoltaic community. As for the perovskite-related compound (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 applied for solar cells, the conversion efficiency is severely restricted by the unsatisfactory photoactive film quality. Herein we report a novel two-step approach\u2014 high-vacuum BiI3 deposition and low-vacuum homogeneous transformation of BiI3 to (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9\u2014for highly compact, pinhole-free, large-grained films, which are characterized with absorption coefficient, trap density of states, and charge diffusion length comparable to those of some lead perovskite analogues. Accordingly, the solar cells have realized a record power conversion of efficiency of 1.64% and also a high external quantum efficiency approaching 60%. Our work demonstrates the potential of (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 for highly efficient and long-term stable solar cells.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth-based solar cells have exhibited some advantages over lead perovskite solar cells for nontoxicity and superior stability, which are currently two main concerns in the photovoltaic community. As for the perovskite-related compound (CHNH)BiI applied for solar cells, the conversion efficiency is severely restricted by the unsatisfactory photoactive film quality. Herein we report a novel two-step approach- high-vacuum BiI deposition and low-vacuum homogeneous transformation of BiI to (CHNH)BiI-for highly compact, pinhole-free, large-grained films, which are characterized with absorption coefficient, trap density of states, and charge diffusion length comparable to those of some lead perovskite analogues. Accordingly, the solar cells have realized a record power conversion of efficiency of 1.64% and also a high external quantum efficiency approaching 60%. Our work demonstrates the potential of (CHNH)BiI for highly efficient and long-term stable solar cells.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This work focuses on reducing the hysteresis and improving the stability of TiO 2 -based perovskite solar cells. A simple slow hydrolysis and rapid evaporation (SHRE) method was developed to deposit amorphous nanoporous WO x  up on the TiO 2  base at low temperature to form a TiO 2 -WO x  bilayer as composite electron transport materials (ETMs) for efficient CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3  solar cells. In the composite bilayers, the nanoporous WO x  sublayer functions as an effective scaffold to modify the electrical contact between the perovskite and TiO 2 , and also as an anti-reflective film to enhance light transmittance. The WO x  modifying layer much reduces the serious hysteresis and the dependence of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) on the  J \u2013 V  scan rates. Moreover, it has also significantly enhanced the long-term stability of solar cells. The functioning mechanism for the WO x  modifying layer in the TiO 2 -WO x  composite ETMs is explored and interpreted in terms of nanoporous inorganic scaffolds and also the salutary effect of capacitive currents from the high-capacitance WO x .",

Lignocellulosic biomass has the potential to contribute to meeting the demand for biofuel production via hydrolysis and fermentation of released sugars, such as glucose, xylose, and arabinose. Construction of robust cell factories requires introducing and rewiring of their metabolism to efficiently use all these sugars. Here, we review recent advances in re-constructing pathways for metabolism of pentoses, with special focus on xylose metabolism in the most widely used cell factories  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and  Escherichia coli . We also highlight engineering advanced biofuels-synthesis pathways and describes progress toward overcoming the challenges facing adoption of large-scale biofuel production.",

In this study, a part of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle from Metallosphaera sedula was utilized for 3HP production. To study the basic biochemistry of this pathway, an in vitro-reconstituted system was established using acetyl-CoA as the substrate for the kinetic analysis of this system. The results indicated that 3HP formation was sensitive to acetyl-CoA carboxylase and malonyl-CoA reductase, but not malonate semialdehyde reductase. Also, the competition between 3HP formation and fatty acid production was analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. This study has highlighted how metabolic flux is controlled by different catalytic components. We believe that this reconstituted system would be valuable for understanding 3HP biosynthesis pathway and for future engineering studies to enhance 3HP production.",

To expand the maximum dynamic range of a transcription factor-based biosensor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using the fapO/FapR system from Bacillus subtilis as an example case, five native promoters, including constitutive and glucose-regulated ones, were modified. By evaluating different binding site (BS) positions in the core promoters, we identified locations that resulted in a high maximum dynamic range with low expression under repressed conditions. We further identified BS positions in the upstream element region of the TEF1 promoter that did not influence the native promoter strength but resulted in repression in the presence of a chimeric repressor consisting of FapR and the yeast repressor Mig1. These modified promoters with broad dynamic ranges will provide useful information for the engineering of future biosensors and their use in complex genetic circuits.",

However, S. cerevisiae exhibits limited production capacity for lipophilic natural products, especially compounds that accumulate intracellularly, such as polyketides and carotenoids, with some engineered compounds displaying cytotoxicity. In this study, we used a nature-inspired strategy to establish an effective platform to improve lipid oil-triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism and enable increased lycopene accumulation. Through systematic traditional engineering methods, we achieved relatively high-level production at 56.2mg lycopene/g cell dry weight (cdw). To focus on TAG metabolism in order to increase lycopene accumulation, we overexpressed key genes associated with fatty acid synthesis and TAG production, followed by modulation of TAG fatty acyl composition by overexpressing a fatty acid desaturase (OLE1) and deletion of Seipin (FLD1), which regulates lipid-droplet size. Results showed that the engineered strain produced 70.5mg lycopene/g cdw, a 25% increase relative to the original high-yield strain, with lycopene production reaching 2.37g/L and 73.3mg/g cdw in fed-batch fermentation and representing the highest lycopene yield in S. cerevisiae reported to date. These findings offer an effective strategy for extended systematic metabolic engineering through lipid engineering.",

A seed-specific expression system can be used to produce recombinant proteins. We report a seed-specific expression system for the manufacture of anti-HER2 ScFv-Fc in  Arabidopsis thaliana , driven by the  Phaseolus vulgaris  \u03b2-phaseolin promoter. Recombinant anti-HER2 ScFv-Fc was successfully and specifically expressed in seeds, and identified by protein analysis. The highest protein accumulation level, with a maximum of 1.1% of total soluble protein, was observed in mature seeds. We also demonstrated the anti-tumor potency of the plant-derived antibody against SK-BR-3\u00a0cells. These results suggest that seed-expression systems could contribute to the manufacture of commercial antibodies such as anti-HER2 ScFv-Fc.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The East Kunlun Orogenic Belt (EKOB) provides an important link to reconstruct the evolution of the Proto-Tethys and Paleo-Tethys realm. The EKOB is marked by widespread Early Paleozoic magmatism. Here we report the petrology, bulk geochemistry, zircon U\u2013Pb dating and, Lu\u2013Hf and Sr\u2013Nd isotopic data of the Early Paleozoic granitic rocks in Zhiyu area of the southern EKOB. Based on the zircon U\u2013Pb dating, these granitoids, consisting of diorite, granodiorite and monzogranite, were formed during 450\u2013430\u00a0Ma the Late Ordovician to Middle Silurian. The diorite and granodiorite are high Sr/Y ratio as adakitic affinities, and the monzogranite belongs to highly fractionated I-type. Their ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr)  i   values range from 0.7059 to 0.7085,  e  Nd ( t ) values from \u20131.6 to \u20136.0 and the zircon e Hf ( t ) values show large variations from\u00a0+9.1 to \u20138.6 with Hf model ages ( T  DM2 ) about 848\u00a0Ma and 1970\u00a0Ma. The large variations of whole-rock Nd and zircon Hf isotopes demonstrate strong isotopic heterogeneity of the source regions which probably resulted from multi-phase underplating of mantle-derived magmas. Geochemical and isotopic studies proved that the diorite and granodiorite had been derived from partial melting of heterogeneous crustal source with variable contributions from ancient continental crust and juvenile components, and the monzogranites were representing fractional crystallization and crustal contamination for arc magma. The Early Paleozoic adakitic rocks and high-K calc-alkaline granitoids in the southern EKOB were likely emplaced in a continental marginal arc setting possibly linked to the southwards subduction of the Paleo Kunlun Ocean and the magma generation is linked to partial melting of thickened continental crust induced by underplating of mantle-derived magmas.",

        "abstract": "The Late Cretaceous Mamba granodiorite belongs to a part of the Mesozoic Gangdese continental magmatic belt. No quantitative mineralogical study has been made hitherto, and hence the depth at which it formed is poorly constrained. Here we present mineralogical data for the Mamba pluton, including host rocks and their mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs), to provide insights into their overall crystallization conditions and information about magma mixing. All amphiboles in the Mamba pluton are calcic, with B(Ca+Na)u003e1.5, and Si=6.81\u20137.42 apfu for the host rocks and Si=6.77\u20137.35 apfu for the MMEs. The paramount cation substitutions in amphibole include edenite type and tschermakite type. Biotites both in the host rocks and the MMEs collectively have high MgO (13.19 wt.%\u201313.03 wt.%) contents, but define a narrow range of Al apfu (atoms per formula unit) variations (2.44\u20132.57). The oxygen fugacity estimates are based on the biotite compositions cluster around the NNO buffer. The calculated pressure ranges from 1.2 to 2.1 kbar according to the aluminum-in-hornblende barometer. The computed pressure varies from 0.9 to 1.3 kbar based on the aluminum-in-biotite barometer which corresponds to an average depth of ca. 3.9 km. Besides, the estimates of crystallization pressures vary from 0.8 to 1.4 kbar based on the amphibole barometer proposed by Ridolfi et al. (2010), which can be equivalent to the depths ranging from 3.1 to 5.2 km. The MMEs have plagioclase oscillatory zonings and quartz aggregates, probably indicating the presence of magma mixing. Besides, core-to-rim element variations (Rb, Sr, Ba, and P) for the K-feldspar megacrysts serve as robust evidence to support magma mixing and crystal fractionation. This indicates the significance of the magma mixing that contributes to the formation of K-feldspar megacryst zonings in the Mamba pluton.",

        "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials with different morphologies are attracting more and more attention in many fields due to their excellent performance. Various methods have been developed to prepare carbonaceous materials with different functions. In this work, we developed a \u201cgreen\u201d strategy to prepare phosphate-rich carbonaceous spheres via a one-step mild hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process using glucose and vinylphosphonic acid (VPA) as precursors. Water was the sole solvent employed in this synthesis process, which is environmentally friendly. To augment the content of phosphate groups on the surfaces of carbonaceous spheres, water-soluble 4,4\u2032-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) was added to the HTC system as a thermal initiator. The size of the obtained carbonaceous spheres could reach 1\u20138 \u03bcm. Following chelation with titanium ions (Ti4+), the carbonaceous spheres were applied as an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) material; the Ti4+ content of carbonaceous spheres reached 2.685% (wt%). This synthetic process for Ti4+-IMAC carbonaceous spheres was facile and time-saving, avoiding the tedious and complex process for traditional Ti4+-IMAC materials. Furthermore, the Ti4+-IMAC carbonaceous spheres exhibited satisfactory enrichment ability for phosphopeptides in the digest of \u03b2-casein and could enrich the low-abundance phosphopeptides in human serum, indicating a great potential use in phosphopeptide analysis.",

        "abstract": "Hierarchically porous monoliths as a key feature of biological materials have been applied in enrichment and separation. In this work, a metal immobilized hierarchically porous organosilica hybrid monolith was synthesized by hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and diethoxyphosphorylethyl-triethoxysilane (DPTS) under alkaline environment. Phosphonate ester groups were firstly introduced by the employment of DPTS as functional monomer, and then acidified to phosphonic acids. The surface area of optimal monolith could reach to 1170\u202fm/g, which simultaneously contained micropores and mesopores (4\u202fnm) obtained from nitrogen sorption measurement. Meanwhile, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) further demonstrated that macropores (1-3\u202f\u03bcm) existed in monoliths. Followed by chelating with titanium ion (Ti), the hierarchically porous organosilica hybrid monoliths could be applied as IMAC materials. This synthesized process was easy-operating and time-saving, and avoided the tedious and complex process of traditional Ti-IMAC materials. Furthermore, the Ti-IMAC monoliths exhibited high adsorption capacity for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (82.6\u202fmg/g). The 3282 unique phosphopeptides could be identified from 100\u202f\u03bcg of HeLa digests after enrichment with the monolith, exhibiting excellent enrichment performance of low-abundance phosphopeptides.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Billets of Mg-9Al-3Zn-1Mn-6Ca-2Nd alloy were produced by spray-deposition (the Osprey process). Effect of rolling deformation ( T  = \u00a0350\u00a0\u00b0C,  e\u00a0 =\u00a05%, 10%, and 15%, respectively) on microstructure and texture evolution of the Mg-9Al-3Zn-1Mn-6Ca-2Nd alloy was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results show that at pass reduction of  e\u00a0 =\u00a05%, 10% and 15% at 350\u00a0\u00b0C respectively, Mg-Nd-Zn typed 24R-LPSO structure was formed in (Ca, Nd)Al 2  phase (C15 Laves phase). With the increase in pass reduction ( i.e.  5%, 10% and 15%), the texture pole density level of basal texture (0002) changed little and pyramidal texture (10      1   \u00af     3) were increased. In contrast, those of prismatic texture {10      1   \u00af     0}       2   \u00af     0u003e were increased initially and followed by a reduction, indicating texture randomization in the grain-refined Mg alloy. The combined contribution of LPSO phase and C15 phase was key to randomize the texture of the grain-refined Mg alloy. It was noted that the microcosmic plastic deformation of LPSO phase and nanometer-sized dispersed C15 phase impeded dislocation movement, led to dislocation tangles, and facilitated recrystallization.",

        "abstract": "Mg alloys have been applied widely as structural materials over the past decades, with low density, high specific strength, stiffness, specific elastic modulus, and high recycling rate. However, their features of poor ductility and formability at room temperature have limited their application due to hexagonal close-packed crystal structure with less independent slip systems. Grain refinement and texture randomization are two means to activate other slip systems. In this work, the billets of Mg-9Al-3Zn-1Mn-6Ca-2Nd alloy produced by spraying deposition method (the Osprey process) were studied in order to analyze the effect of rolling deformation at 350 \u00b0C and pass reduction e =20%, 25% and 30% on texture and microstructure evolution of an extruded size-asymmetry Mg alloy by SEM, TEM and XRD. The results show that under the condition of reduction of e =20% at 350 \u00b0C, a long-period stacking ordered phase with 24R structure was formed in (Ca, Nd)Al2 phase (C15 Laves phase ). All of basal texture (0002), prismatic texture {1010} , and pyramidal texture {1012} were activated, with pole density level weakened while pass reduction increased (e =20% , 25% and 30% ), namely, texture randomization achieved in Mg alloy, with main causes of nanometer-sized dispersed C15 phase impeding dislocation movement \u7b2c938-944\u9875 pp.938-944",

        "abstract": "Nicorandil exerts myocardial protection through its antihypoxia and antioxidant effects. Here, we investigated whether it plays an anti-apoptotic role in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with high-fat diet; then single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin was performed. Rats with fasting blood glucose (FBG) higher than 11.1\u00a0mmol/L were selected as models. Eight weeks after the models were built, rats were treated with nicorandil (7.5\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0day and 15\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0day respectively) for 4\u00a0weeks. H9c2 cardiomyocytes were treated with nicorandil and then stimulated with high glucose (33.3\u00a0mmol/L). TUNEL assay and level of bcl-2, bax and caspase-3 were measured. 5-HD was used to inhibit nicorandil. Also, PI3K inhibitor (Miltefosine) and mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) were used to inhibit PI3K/Akt pathway. The results revealed that nicorandil (both 7.5\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0day and 15mg/kg day) treatment can increase the level of NO in the serum and eNOS in the heart of diabetic rats compared with the untreated diabetic group. Nicorandil can also improve relieve cardiac dysfunction and reduce the level of apoptosis. In vitro experiments, nicorandil (100\u00a0\u00b5mol) can attenuate the level of apoptosis stimulated by high glucose significantly in H9C2 cardiomyocyte compared with the untreated group. The effect of nicorandil on apoptosis was blocked by 5-HD, and it was accompanied with inhibition of the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, eNOS, and mTOR. After inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway, the protective effect of nicorandil is restrained. These results verified that as a NO donor, nicorandil can also inhibit apoptosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy which is mediated by PI3K/Akt pathway.",

        "abstract": "At present, multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer therapy is an international problem, which is caused mostly by the overexpressed P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump. To address this issue and effectively deliver chemotherapeutic drugs to cancer cells, a liposomal drug delivery system (DOX/QUE BPL) has been designed for the co-delivery of the antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) and the traditional Chinese medicine quercetin (QUE). The MTT assay demonstrated that DOX/QUE BPL showed the highest cytotoxicity of all formulations tested against MCF-7/adr cell lines due to the inhibition of P-gp caused by QUE. The same result could also be confirmed by cellular uptake assay. To investigate the mechanism by which QUE reverses the MDR effect, DOX accumulation and efflux, P-gp expression and ATP content determination were measured and the results indicated that QUE could downregulate the expression of P-gp and facilitate drug accumulation in the cytoplasm, thereby reversing the MDR effect. In vivo antitumor activity studies demonstrated that DOX/QUE BPL could reach higher antitumor activity than other reference preparations for MCF-7/adr solid tumors. Histological assays indicated that this preparation could decrease the cardio toxicity arising from DOX and induce apoptosis in solid tumors. Meanwhile, this preparation could also downregulate the expression of P-gp in vivo. All this evidence demonstrated that this liposomal formulation is a suitable carrier for co-delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to overcome MDR.",

These imaging technologies are gaining interest and becoming more widely used and applied in ecological, systematic, evolutionary, and physiological studies of plants and also of animals. However, important factors may impact the quality and consistency of body reflectance features and therefore the ability to use these technologies as part of non-invasive phenotyping and characterization of organisms. We acquired hyperspectral body reflectance profiles from three insect species, and we examined how preparation procedures and preservation time affected the ability to detect reflectance responses to gender, origin, and age. Different portions of the radiometric spectrum varied markedly in their sensitivity to preparation procedures and preservation time. Based on studies of three insect species, we successfully identified specific radiometric regions, in which phenotypic traits become significantly more pronounced based on either: 1) gentle cleaning of museum specimens with distilled water, or 2) killing and preserving insect specimens in 70% ethanol. Standardization of killing and preservation procedures will greatly increase the ability to use proximal imaging remote sensing technologies as part of phenotyping and also when used in ecological and evolutionary studies of invertebrates.",

In order to detect the damage quantitatively, a kind of change-prone micro eddy current sensor is designed and fabricated with flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) technology. A forward semi-analytical model is built by extracting a material\u2019s conductivity as the damage feature parameter, and characteristics analysis is conducted based on the model. The research focuses on setting up and utilizing the eddy current fields to analyze interaction of adjoining coils when the damage occurs, and investigating optimization on the working parameters of the sensor. In the experimental section, several common connection structures are applied to explore the sensor\u2019s monitoring ability both in air and in a corrosive environment. The result shows that the optimal working frequency is about 1\u00a0MHz. The eddy current micro sensor is capable of monitoring the crack growth with an accuracy of 1\u00a0mm, the average error being 4.6\u00a0% compared to fracture analysis. The sensor keeps high resolution of damage in aqueous corrosion. Due to the fretting fatigue, wear appears on the polyimide foil, leading to the decreases of the monitoring signal.",

        "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization of urban bus network can help improve operation efficiency of the transit system and develop strategies for reducing urban traffic congestion in China. The work used cumulative prospect theory, currently the most influential model for decision under uncertainty, to optimize urban bus network. To achieve the research objective, the work developed the theoretical framework of urban bus network optimization, including optimization principle, optimization objectives and constraints. Furthermore, optimization objectives could comprehensively reflect expectations of passengers and bus companies from the dimension of time, space and value. It is more scientific and reasonable compared with only one stakeholder or dimension alone in the previous studies. In addition, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was used to determine the positive and negative ideal alternative. The correlations between the optimization alternatives and the ideal alternatives were estimated by grey relational analysis simultaneously. The cumulative prospect theory (CPT) was used to determine the best alternative by comparing comprehensive prospect value of every alternative, accurately describing decision-making behavior compared with expected utility theory in actual life. Finally, Case of Xi\u2019an showed that the method can better adjust the bus network, and the optimization solution is more reasonable to meet the actual needs.",

As predicted by density functional theory (DFT) method simulations, cyclo[6]aramide 1a is able to bind amidinium salts G1\u2013G5 with varying binding affinity in 1\u2006:\u20061 stoichiometry through hydrogen bonding interactions involving both anion-recognizing amide H-atoms and cation-binding amide carbonyl O-atoms. Particularly, the binding affinities for G1, G2 and G3 are found to decrease with increasing the size of substituents in the amidinium ion in the order of G1 u003e G2 u003e G3. Moreover, the association ability for simultaneous binding of cationic and anionic guest species depends considerably on the counterions. Among the four formamidinium salts (Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, I\u2212 and BPh4\u2212) examined, formamidinium chloride is best encapsulated as a contact ion-pair species in the macrocycle. The reduced association constants with increasing the size of counterions in the order of G1 u003e G6 u003e G7 u003e G4 underscore the importance of ion paring in effecting the host\u2013guest interaction. Comparative conductivity studies provide a convenient approach to differentiate between contact and loose ion pairs for these amidinium complexes. This work provides a rare example of binding biologically important types of amidinium cations as ion pairs by a synthetic receptor.",

        "abstract": "Examples of using two-dimensional shape-persistent macrocycles,  those having noncollapsible and geometrically well-defined skeletons, for constructing mechanically interlocked molecules are scarce, which contrasts the many applications of these macrocycles in molecular recognition and functional self-assembly. Herein, we report the crucial role played by macrocyclic shape-persistency in enhancing multipoint recognition for the highly efficient template-directed synthesis of rotaxanes. Cyclo[6]aramides, with a near-planar conformation, are found to act as powerful hosts that bind bipyridinium salts with high affinities. This unique recognition module, composed of two macrocyclic molecules with one bipyridinium ion thread through the cavity, is observed both in the solid state and in solution, with unusually high binding constants ranging from \u223c10 M to \u223c10 M in acetone. The high efficacy of this recognition motif is embodied by the formation of compact [3]rotaxanes in excellent yields based on either a \"click-capping\" (91%) or \"facile one-pot\" (85%) approach, underscoring the great advantage of using H-bonded aromatic amide macrocycles for the highly efficient template-directed synthesis of mechanically interlocked structures. Furthermore, three cyclo[6]aramides bearing different peripheral chains  demonstrate high specificity in the synthesis of a [3]rotaxane from  and , and a [2]rotaxane from  a \"facile one-pot\" approach, in each case as the only isolated product. Analysis of the crystal structure of the [3]rotaxane reveals a highly compact binding mode that would be difficult to access using other macrocycles with a flexible backbone. Leveraging this unique recognition motif, resulting from the shape-persistency of these oligoamide macrocycles, in the template-directed synthesis of compact rotaxanes may open up new opportunities for the development of higher order interlocked molecules and artificial molecular machines.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to prepare aligned porous niobium scaffolds with open interconnected pore channels by a freeze-drying process, the well dispersed aqueous slurries of niobium were directionally frozen and then dried by sublimation of ice crystals at a reduced pressure. Meanwhile, in consideration of the freeze\u2013drying process being a time-consuming process, even a costly process while the manufacture route has been up\u2013scaled to an industrial process, the process of freeze and drying has been analyzed by a numerical method based on an equivalent heat capacity model which is capable of describing freeze\u2013drying process. The results indicated that the microstructure of the sintered samples, which were characterized by SEM, presents well interconnected pore channels. With the niobium volume percentage increasing, the interval of the niobium wall decreases progressively and the layer thickness of the walls increases inversely. The numerical results indicated that the required time for freeze process is strongly affected by the slurry concentration and the temperature of substrate whereas it is relatively affected by the pressure of the chamber and the niobium volume percentage in the frozen body during drying process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The electronic structures and mechanical properties of Nb\u2013doped TiAl 2  intermetallic compounds have been investigated using the first\u2013principles method based on the density functional theoretical framework. The calculated results indicate that the structural symmetry of orthorhombic TiAl 2  has been changed after the Al or Ti atoms are replaced by the Nb atoms. The formation energy of the systems in which Al atom replaced by Nb is lower than that of Ti atom replaced by Nb. Accordingly, the Nb atoms are more likely to occupy the sites of Al atoms to form a stable structure when the Nb atoms are introduced into orthorhombic TiAl 2  compound. Additionally, the formation energy of the doped systems increases with the increase of Nb atom percentage. Nb doping weakens the covalent bonding between Ti and Al atoms and enhances the metal bonding between them. The band structures of Nb\u2013doped TiAl 2  systems also indicate that they all have metallic conductivities, which is beneficial to decrease the brittleness of orthorhombic TiAl 2  intermetallic compounds at room temperature. Compared with those systems in which Ti atoms replaced by Nb atoms, the ductility of the Nb\u2013doped TiAl 2  system in which Al atoms are replaced by Nb atoms has been improved better. It is attributed to the density of state near Fermi energy level being increased after Al atoms being replaced by Nb atoms. The fracture strength of Nb\u2013doped TiAl 2  systems is both better than that of the purely TiAl 2 , especially in the system of Ti atoms replaced by Nb atoms.",

Based on the configuration of Yingli n-PERT PANDA cells, phosphorus implantation is employed to fabricate n+ back surface field (BSF) as an alternative to POCl3 diffusion. A 20.3% cell efficiency on average with a maximum value of 20.5% was achieved in mass production by process optimization such as ion implantation, annealing during PECVD and passivation improvement. Resulted modeling data indicates that the selective-BSF (SBSF) cell efficiency gain was 0.2% absolute compared with rear totally homogeneous doped cell after process optimization and the SBSF cells reach the best efficiency at a wafer resistivity around 0.5\u20131 \u03a9 cm depending on wafer lifetime. In this work we proved that cells with efficiency higher than 21% can be realized by optimizing sheet resistance of rear surface and improving passivation.",

        "title": "MLP-deficient human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure phenotypes due to abnormal calcium handling.",
        "abstract": "Muscle LIM protein (MLP, CSRP3) is a key regulator of striated muscle function, and its mutations can lead to both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in patients. However, due to lack of human models, mechanisms underlining the pathogenesis of MLP defects remain unclear. In this study, we generated a knockout MLP/CSRP3 human embryonic stem cell (hESC) H9 cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene disruption. CSRP3 disruption had no impact on the cardiac differentiation of H9 cells and led to confirmed MLP deficiency in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (ESC-CMs). MLP-deficient hESC-CMs were found to develop phenotypic features of HCM early after differentiation, such as enlarged cell size, multinucleation, and disorganized sarcomeric ultrastructure. Cellular phenotypes of MLP-deficient hESC-CMs subsequently progressed to mimic heart failure (HF) by 30 days post differentiation, including exhibiting mitochondrial damage, increased ROS generation, and impaired Ca handling. Pharmaceutical treatment with beta agonist, such as isoproterenol, was found to accelerate the manifestation of HCM and HF, consistent with transgenic animal models of MLP deficiency. Furthermore, restoration of Ca homeostasis by verapamil prevented the development of HCM and HF phenotypes, suggesting that elevated intracellular Ca concentration is a central mechanism for pathogenesis of MLP deficiency. In summary, MLP-deficient hESC-CMs recapitulate the pathogenesis of HCM and its progression toward HF, providing an important human model for investigation of CSRP3/MLP-associated disease pathogenesis. More importantly, correction of the autonomous dysfunction of Ca handling was found to be an effective method for treating the in vitro development of cardiomyopathy disease phenotype.",
